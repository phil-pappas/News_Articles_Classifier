Pictured: Baal Shamin in Palmyra, Syria which was obliterated this week by the terror group\nThe Â£2m project has been developed by the Institute for Digital Archaeology (IDA) in Oxford, as the terrorists continue to inflict the worst spate of archaeological destruction since the Second World War.\nThe announcement comes just days after ISIS fighters obliterated the 2,000-year-old Baal Shamin temple in Palmyra, Syria, which was described by UN cultural watchdog Unesco as a 'war crime'.\nRoger Michel, the IDA's director, told The Times that Palmyra was 'rapidly becoming the symbol of Isis's cultural iconoclasm'.\nRELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Will ISIS siege of Palmyra end in 'total destruction'?...

Share this article Share 'If Isis is permitted to wipe the slate clean and rewrite the history of a region that defined global aesthetic and political sensibilities, we will collectively suffer a costly and irreversible defeat,' he said.\n'But there is hope. By placing the record of our past in the digital realm, it will lie for ever beyond the reach of vandals and terrorists.'\nWith the terrorists continuing their demolition at a frightening pace, the IDA and Unesco want to collate up to 5million pictures of objects by the end of this year. By the end of 2017, they want 20m photographs to have been taken.\nArchaeological experts are planning to 'flood the Middle East with 3D cameras' so they can digitally catalogue every artefact, building or monument - such as Hatra, Iraq (pictured) - which is under threat from the jihadists\nIf the treasures - such as Tchogha Zanbil in Iraq - are then destroyed, conservationists believe they could use high-tech printing technology to reconstruct them in the same style as the original antiques\nThe process would rely on volunteers throughout the selected countries - including Iraq, Lebanon, Iran, Yemen and eastern Turkey - taking photographs before uploading them to a database.\nThe scheme would then ask owners of 3D printers around the world to volunteer to help reconstruct the treasure.\nIn the George Clooney film Monuments Man, released last year, a team of experts were sent in to Nazi-occupied Europe during World War II to try and salvage culturally-important items.\n'It will include GPS data and dates,' Mr Michel said. 'If someone is selling an object and says it was obtained in Syria in the 1930s we will know that was not the case because in 2015 it was at longitude X and latitude Y.'\nThe relatively-new technology of 3D printing is continuing to progress. Last year, a five-story house was among a series of properties created in an industrial park in China's Jiangsu province.\nThe archaeologists also want to take pictures of artefacts in eastern Turkey, including Gobekli Tepe (pictured), the oldest known human-made religious structure\nThe cultural landscape of Bamiyan Valley, Afghanistan. The process would rely on volunteers taking the photographs on internet-led cameras before uploading them to a database\nThe homes were created using a printer which is 21ft tall, 32ft wide and 500ft long. The 'ink' used was a mixture of recycled construction waste, glass, steel and cement which was sprayed on layer by layer until a thick wall was created.\nThe attacks on holy sites in the Middle East began in 2001 when Taliban fighters destroyed two statues of Buddha carved into the hills of Bamiyan, Afghanistan.\nAnd in the past year, ISIS has destroyed dozens of churches and ancient archaeological sites.\nThe militants see such sites as targets because of their desire to wipe out all traces of 'non-Islamic' history and what they regard as the idolatrous objects.\nMost recently, ISIS used a bulldozer to demolish the 1,500-year-old Mar Elian Monastery, a national Syrian treasure, which has stood in Al-Qaryatayn since 432 AD.\nIn the George Clooney film Monuments Man, released last year, a team of experts were sent in to Nazi-occupied Europe during World War II to try and salvage culturally-important items (pictured)\nThe group also sparked global outrage when militants were filmed destroying a collection of priceless statues and structures inside a Mosul museum.\nIt later turned out that most of the 3,000-year-old sculptures were worthless were replicas of the real artefacts which are housed safely in the capital Baghdad.\nAfter the footage was released in February, Mosul's exiled governor confirmed the vast majority were fakes but at least two of the destroyed structures were authentic.\nIn April, footage showed ISIS using sledgehammers and barrel bombs to demolish the Iraqi city of Nimrud - near Mosul - which dates back to 13th Century BC.\nMilitants hammered away 3,000-year-old sculptures and carved stone slabs before bulldozing and exploding the ruins.\nJust weeks earlier the terror group took apart the historic Iraqi city of Hatra using AK-47 rifles and hammers.\nAnother video showed the extremists smashing shrines and statues in the 2,000-year-old city which was awarded UNESCO World Heritage status in 1985.\nRead more: High-tech plan to save ancient sites from Isis | The Times", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1i6pA3K", "http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/middleeast/article4540560.ece", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2015-08-28T13:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:28:53.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
