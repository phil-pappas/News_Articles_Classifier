PUBLISHED: 19:11, Sat, Sep 26, 2015 | UPDATED: 19:32, Sat, Sep 26, 2015 AFP Children play in the Demilitarised Zone straddling the North/South Korean border \nThrough one of the bank of end-of-the-pier-like telescopes I can in the distance just see a statue of dictator Kim Jong-un’s now-gone dictator dad, Kim Jong-il, and a fluttering king or dictator size flag. \nI’m at the edge of the strip of land between me and what is generally perceived as one of the most dangerous countries on earth. \nA cloud of birds of prey swirling ominously above with a serene beauty. \nI’d like to say I was alone with my thoughts but you’re never really alone in the DMZ (the Demilitarised Zone) twixt South Korea, home of the “nice guys”, and their warmongering northern brethren. \nThis buffer is patrolled by a veritable army of troops under UN command but they are almost outnumbered by the buses, the only way in for tourists, that rumble from one site to another. \nThe soldiers at the checkpoint into the DMZ, like a classic border post from Cold War movies, are all in camouflage gear and mud-coloured facepaint, which seems a tad extreme particularly as those directing the traffic between the spiked road obstacles, the steel barriers and the armoured cars also sport high-visibility jerkins. visitkorea.or.kr Soldiers armed in the Demilitarised Zone visitkorea.or.kr A visitor centre where pro-South propaganda films are shown \nIt’s a scrubby place looking, perhaps unsurprisingly, like the faceless setting of the Korean War comedy M*A*S*H. In 1978 a Northern defector spilled the beans about what turned out to be a 1.1 mile tunnel, carved by hand, wide enough for two soldiers to march abreast, that ran beyond the then-line of the DMZ into the South \nOver in North Korea, a mile or so across no man’s land, they are, we’re told, declaring war, preparing nukes, launching cyber attacks on Hollywood and digging tunnels, yet this is a fun day out for all the family. \nA DMZ tour starts at Imjingak Peace Park, only an hour north of Incheon airport, Seoul’s sleek gateway, built when the South hosted the 1999 World Cup. \nThe DMZ is notionally dedicated to reunifi cation yet the Popeye’s burger bar, funfair, gift shop selling camoufl age romper suits and (even on a chill February day) the many buses suggest disunity means money. \nThere’s a jolly feel as we pull up to Dorasan, several minutes away through gates and wire fences, a gleaming rail terminus that welcomes two trains a day from Seoul, 25 miles away. \nIt wasn’t meant to be a terminus; a few years back a rail line was agreed between the two countries, linking into the Trans-Siberian Express and, ultimately, London. \nYet at the last minute the North reneged – with much behind-the-hand tittering, one imagines. visitkorea.or.kr DMZ tours start at Imjingak Peace Park, an hour north of Incheon aiport \nAt the station shop, in the spirit of unifi cation, I buy a half-bottle of North Korean brandy for £8. \nThen it’s the observatory where a bored recruit looks on as, ignoring the No Photos sign, the selfie sticks come out with gay abandon. \nI put a coin into a telescope and fi nd myself disappointed that I can see no North Koreans staring back. \nA five-minute drive past an army camp is a visitor centre where a pro-South fi lm unites the energy of a US war movie with the attack of a British Second World War propaganda short. After another bus hop, I don a hard hat and enter the Third Tunnel of Aggression. \nIn 1978 a Northern defector spilled the beans about what turned out to be a 1.1 mile tunnel, carved by hand, wide enough for two soldiers to march abreast, that ran beyond the then-line of the DMZ into the South. visitkorea.or.kr The border zone between the two Korean nations is heavily patrolled \nI walk half a mile before reaching the point where it is concreted firmly shut. \nThey’re taking no chances; given the number of giggling visitors I’ve no doubt about the claim it could have disgorged 30,000 troops an hour. \nThree other tunnels have been found and there’s every chance those pesky North Koreans are still at it with shovels as we speak. \nLast stop, theme park fashion, is the shop. \nThis, though, is a country store selling produce from farms within the DMZ. \nBag of souvenir rice anyone? \nI buy a brightly-painted model of a North Korean soldier and get out while the going’s good.
