Rather than school groups showing up and showing themselves around, the museum will have a staff to guide them. \nThe 10,000-square-foot museum is planning a new, two-story, 63,000-square-foot facility with the top floor dedicated to the educational mission. \nAs part of the program, the museum is partnering with Natick-based MathWorks to develop technology to enhance students' interactions with museum artifacts. The initiative is being launched through a major gift from the Shipley Foundation. \nThe nonprofit museum, founded in 1999, has 7,000 artifacts on display and more than 500,000 documents and photographs in its research archives. The collection includes military uniforms, flags, weapons and other equipment. \n\"People always say kids these days just want to play video games, but that's just not true,\" Rendell said. \"They know what's going on in the world, and it concerns them. Here, we do offer some hope.\" \n__ \nOnline: Museum of World War II: http://www.museumofworldwarii.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T14:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T14:56:23.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
