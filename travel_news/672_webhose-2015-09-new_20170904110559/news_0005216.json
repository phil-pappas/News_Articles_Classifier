Tim Farron MP, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, said after the decision: “Local hotels, B&Bs and tourist attractions are the backbone of our economy and I think they need more help and support. I would like the Government to reduce VAT for tourist attractions and accommodation to boost UK exports, create more jobs and support our local economy.”\nEluned Parrott AM, the Welsh Liberal Democrat Shadow Economy Minister, said: “Tourism accounts for 10 per cent of our economy and employs three million people, with nearly half of those jobs taken up by young people. But we have some of the higher VAT laws in Europe, with the vast majority of EU countries having already lowered the tax on the industry. If we want to boost tourism, create more jobs and continue to showcase the best of Britain, it’s time we gave the sector a helping hand.”\nMartin Horwood, the former MP for Cheltenham who surmised the motion said: “This policy will level the uneven playing field, help small businesses, grow the economy and create jobs over time whilst delivering a net benefit to HM Treasury, and it’s popular too. It’s a win, win win. “\nThe Campaign to Cut Tourism VAT is supported by over 125 MPs from across the political spectrum. An All Party Parliamentary Group for the Visitor Economy has been established and is co-chaired by Nigel Huddleston MP (Conservative) and Margaret Ritchie MP (SDLP).\nThe aim of the group is to enhance the local economy by promoting measures and incentives, including a reduction of VAT on tourism, which would increase visitor numbers and investment in all parts of the UK.\nThe UK has the second highest rate of VAT on hotel accommodation in the European Union and is one of only three EU member states that have not reduced VAT on accommodation and attractions.\nDermot King, Chairman of the Cut Tourism Vat campaign and MD, Butlins said: “The evidence behind the benefits of a reduction of tourism VAT to businesses, the national economy and British families has never been clearer and I am pleased to see the Liberal Democrats taking up the cause. We now need to win the hearts and minds of the British public who don’t realise that they are being taxed harder than almost anyone else in Europe for simply going on holiday in their own country.”\n“We hope that the Chancellor will consider making this reduction, part of the Comprehensive Spending Review now underway,” Mr King said.\nUfi Ibrahim, Chief Executive of the British Hospitality Association, the organisation behind the high profile campaign, said: “This decision by the Liberal Democrats reflects the growing political support for our campaign. Tourism is the UK’s only major export subject to 20% VAT – double the rate of the EU average. Growing numbers of MPs are joining our call to Treasury for a Cut in VAT on tourism exports.\nThe UK’s Tourism deficit has been in excess of £10bn for far too long. It’s time to ensure tourism taxes do not deter more Britons from enjoying the UK staycation, and do not impede our ability to attract greater numbers of international visitors, especially beyond London’. An analysis by Nevin Associates concluded that a 15% cut in VAT on tourism would reduce the UK’s Balance of Trade deficit by £20 billion over 10 years and increase the tax take by £3.9bn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T21:18:49.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
