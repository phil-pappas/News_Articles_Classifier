The reason, says Edmunds, is that dealers have extra urgency to sell these vehicles before the all-new models fill their lots. As a result, buyers stand to save thousands of dollars off Edmunds' True Market Value® (TMV®) price.\n\"Although manufacturers are poised to replace these vehicles with new-generation models, they still offer excellent value and performance,\" says Edmunds.com Senior Consumer Advice Editor Philip Reed . \"Shoppers looking for the best possible deal on a new car right now would be smart to consider the savings these vehicles offer before they weigh any other options.\"\nEdmunds counts at least 31 vehicles that are scheduled for a redesign or refresh for 2016, and are expected to deliver particularly deep discounts for outgoing models. Based on pricing trend predictions, Edmunds highlights the following five vehicles that are likely to stand above the rest:\n2015 BMW 3 Series - A refreshed design of this iconic entry luxury car is coming later this year, pushing down prices on the soon-to-be-outdated model -- and in some parts of the country, it is already selling for over $1,500 below TMV®. BMW offers customer cash rebates along with attractive lease specials. Some rebate offers may also be combined with low-interest financing from dealers.\n2015 Chevrolet Volt – The long-anticipated Volt redesign will debut later this year, making the 2015 model a steal. With relatively low and stable gas prices, sales of the plug-in hybrid Volt are already lagging, so prices are low and incentives are plentiful. Edmunds Price Promise ® offers are already almost $4,000 below TMV® on the 2015 Volt.\n2015 Honda Civic - A popular car for students and those on a budget, the Civic enjoys an A rating from Edmunds editors. Shoppers can find Edmunds Price Promise ® offers on the outgoing Civic model ranging between $1,000 and $2,000 below TMV®.\n2015 Toyota Prius – With gas prices stable, and excitement building toward the release of a new model later this year, prices on the Prius – like the Chevy Volt – have fallen as much as $3,000 below TMV®. Adding a little sweet kick to the deal: Toyota is offering 0% financing for as long as 60 months to qualified buyers.\n2015 Volkswagen Passat – This handsome, refined European sedan is getting a mid-cycle refresh in the fall, pushing prices of the 2015 model over $1,000 below TMV® in some areas of the country. Customer cash incentives and 0% financing make the car a solid choice for families keeping an eye on their budget.\nSome of the discounted offers on 2015 vehicles are regional, so shoppers are urged to check Edmunds Price Promise® offers and incentive information to see what is available in their area. Edmunds further advises consumers to start shopping 2015 model year vehicles as soon as possible to maximize the selection of colors and options.\nAn expanded list of Edmunds.com's 2015 model year selldown recommendations can be found at http://www.edmunds.com/car-buying/best-new-car-leftovers-for-2015.html .\nAbout Edmunds.com , Inc.\nCar shopping destination Edmunds.com serves nearly 20 million visitors each month.
