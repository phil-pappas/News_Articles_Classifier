In addition to the display, special menus with a gift of chopsticks and the special accommodation plan packaged with “washoku (Japanese cuisine)” dinner and a gift of chopsticks engraved with guest’s initials will be offered. \nThis year marks the fourth year that the “Chopstick Exhibition” will be held and it is designed to show both overseas and Japanese guests the cultural beauty reflected in chopsticks as an art form. Because foreign visitors now account for 70% of the guests staying at the Keio Plaza Hotel, we endeavor to make their stay in Japan more enjoyable through the provision of exhibitions to deepen their understanding of Japan and gifts for them to take home as reminders of their visit to Japan. \nAt the exhibition, in addition to displaying how Japanese artistically set up their dining tables, chopsticks and many other items will also be on sale for guests to purchase. Various chopsticks that reflect themes and colors of the various seasons and use Wakasa, Wajima, and Tsugaru paints and other black painting techniques, representative of the Japanese sense of beauty known as “wabi, sabi,” will be on display. \nFor our overseas guests, we will offer special accommodation package that allows them to get a taste of Japanese culture while staying at our hotel. The package includes a traditional Japanese meal called “Sakura Dinner” that allows guests to sample tempura, sushi and sukiyaki at our Japanese restaurant “Kagari.” Chopsticks custom engraved with our guests initials will be presented to them along with their meal to take home as presents.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T01:59:01.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
