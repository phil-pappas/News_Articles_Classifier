That's also the key to keeping your designated driver happy. It's easy to see - and taste - a lot in Paso Robles' compact downtown. And unlike upscale restaurants in Napa Valley, here they have white tablecloths - without the attitude. You can sit down to a meal at the fanciest eateries without having to change your walking shoes. \nArtisan: Go for a light lunch and share house-made charcuterie and cheese, or stop for dinner after a day of tastings. Executive chef Chris Kobayashi's menu includes rabbit stroganoff; goat cheese and ale fondue; and wild boar tenderloin. If you're in the mood for a cocktail, try the barrel-aged Negroni. Meal for two about $70. 843 12th St., Paso Robles; (805) 237-8084, www.artisanpasorobles.com \nDi Raimondo's Italian Market & Cheese Shop: If you're planning on a picnic lunch between tastings, stop here to pick up some Midnight Moon cheese along with prosciutto, Paso Robles-made salumi, olives, crackers and dried fruit. Or you can grab a couple of seats and eat your picnic loot on the patio. Meal for two about $25. 822 13th St., Paso Robles; (805) 238-1268, www.pasocheese.com \nIl Cortile Ristorante: It's upscale, classic Italian, owned by chef Santos MacDonal and his wife and partner, Carole. Handmade pasta is topped with delicate shavings of bottarga, best enjoyed on the patio with a glass of wine. Meal for two about $60. 608 12th St., No. 101, Paso Robles; (805) 226-0300, www.ilcortileristorante.com \nLa Cosecha Bar & Restaurant: This is MacDonal's tapas restaurant, just down the street from Il Cortile. Order an entree if you must, but if you have time to linger, try a couple of shared plates. The pork cheeks are braised and served with pickled vegetables; the charcuterie plate features house pate; and you can't go wrong with the pastelitos catracho (Honduran-style empanadas).
