Launched in South Africa in 1994, the travel agency group turns 21 this month, having been at the forefront of an industry that has experienced phenomenal change – and which continues to experience turbulence thanks to a weakening rand,controversial visa regime and economic uncertainty.\nBut Andrew Stark, MD of Flight Centre Travel Group, is still upbeat.“Revenue airline sales may be down by 14% on prior year, but ticket numbers domestically, regionally and internationally are all up 14%. So there has never been a better time to travel for South Africans,” he says, pointing out that air tickets are considerably cheaper for both leisure and corporate travellers compared with last year.\n“Yes, the strained economy has affected overall airline sales for Flight Centre Travel Group, but packaged holidays are enjoying strong growth, which is very pleasing as this benefits South African travel customers for now.”He says that thanks to aggressive marketing and innovation, Flight Centre has seen growth in packaged, all-inclusive holidays to destinations like Mauritius and Thailand, and also domestically.\nSource:-Flight Centre Travel Group", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:02:40.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
