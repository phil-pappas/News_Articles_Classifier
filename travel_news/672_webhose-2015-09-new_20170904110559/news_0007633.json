No surprises there.\nBut the 41-year-old comedian, who plays a single dad in his latest film, People Places Things, believes his domestic situation is probably replicated right across the animal world.\n“I would say that’s even true of lions — the male lion will play with the cubs while the female goes out and hunts,” he says.\nOther Stories Shot by police to prevent rampage News 0 comments Sales’ cutting question for PM Television How Hayne left Aussie businessman devastated More Sports 0 comments How Duran Duran got their groove back Entertainment 0 comments Why being an escort has made me a better mother Rendezview 0 comments ‘Safety is my middle name’ Nsw 0 comments The Flight Of the Conchords star is reflecting on the tendency for mothers, such as his character’s ex-wife in People Places Things, to shoulder more of the domestic responsibilities while their husbands generate playful activities such as flying a kite.\nTree change ... The relationship between Clement and his on-screen twin daughters hits a temporary snag. Picture: Madman Films. “There are things my son likes to do only with me — like acting out big battles,’’ Clement says.\n“I think it’s more fun because I am the bigger opponent, physically. It feels like he is destroying an ogre four times his size.”\nSuch observations might explain six-year-old Sophocles’ enthusiasm for his father’s most recent role — as a big hairy giant in Steven Spielberg’s upcoming adaptation of the Roald Dahl novel BFG.\n“He loved coming to the (oversized Vancouver) set. He would help me with my lines and give me little directions: ‘not that voice, the other voice,” Clement says.\nNo funny voices were called for when it came to People Places Things, which casts Clement in his first, serious leading man role — as a father-of- two struggling to rebuild his life following the breakdown of his relationship.\nThe teacher and graphic artist Clement plays in James C. Strouse’s film (based on the writer/director’s own life) is closer to the man he is in real life than any of his other characters.\n“Villains are much bigger kind of characters and they take more energy,’’ Clement says.\nAwkward pause ... Clement with co-star Regina Hall. Picture: Madman Films. “In this one, I can speak in my own voice. I didn’t have to try and be cool or scary or anything like that.”\nClement even got to keep his own Kiwi accent.\n“Before I went over to the US, I trained with a dialect coach. But when the director heard it, he said it wasn’t important for me to have (a New York) accent.\n“He might have thought it was terrible,” the actor jokes.\n“But I know he wanted the character to be from somewhere else and an accent was a good way of establishing that.”\nUnlike his character, Clement says he’s never even considered teaching as a way to earn a living\n“The idea terrifies me.”\nHe is, however, quite comfortable with his character’s social awkwardness.\n“It’s much truer to life.\n“I would love to see an action movie whether the superhero or spy doesn’t have a ready quip, where they think of what they would have liked to have said later.”\nWhile humour is Clement’s speciality, he appreciates why comedies fail to pack as much punch at the box office as, say, a Marvel Comics fantasy.\nQuite a team ... Clement with Flight of the Conchords co-star Bret McKenzie. “People have such different ideas about what’s funny — that’s why a comedy will never be as big as an action movie,’’ he says.\n“Something like a Monty Python movie might last longer — people will still be watching it, quoting it (30 years on). But it’s a particular audience. And we can all understand what’s sad or exciting.”\nClement is realistic, too, about the size of the potential audience for an independent comedy such as People Things, described by Los Angeles film critic Kenneth Turan as “an antidote to the swarm of studio behemoth that dominate the summer movie calendar.”\n“There are so many big films that are loud and in-your face — and they have their place definitely,’’ says Clement.\n“But this is at the opposite end of the scale — with real, live situations.\n“I’m not sure if it’s an antidote — it won’t stop the big movies — but it might be a break from them.”\nSEE: People Places Things opens today.\nOriginally published as ‘I didn’t have to try and be cool’", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/2ad9708549886017f198bcd2f3e3ecf0", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/df0da8f9a21f8e4ad064e3fe7cddc065", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e555995493496718634da00a9e49a837?width=650", "http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/even-in-the-animal-world-people-places-things-star-jemaine-clement-says-its-fathers-who-play-games/story-e6frfmvr-1227519951560?sv=550063b9f988e9ed93a2c460ffad39fd", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b54151cbd49de1ef4efe15d0f02f88b2?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d3f9ce998464f79cb326e792296da1e1?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e1ee267f02fce88ba297faf32283a638", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/268550fa8e6e0802e41081e6f826e44a", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cd6495223d9a3c63ad714d8a3630e6a4", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/07503218fc4604974d126e8f3bc7d0aa", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&maxRelated=6&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-09-09T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:42:41.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
