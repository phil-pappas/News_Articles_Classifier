Barriers to market entrants have been brushed aside by the availability of cheaper and more powerful technology. This is great for people starting and growing businesses, but it also means businesses must remain agile to survive. Government figures show that hundreds of thousands of businesses burst into life every year and that growth in the overall stock of companies is accelerating annually. Each one of these start-ups is a potential new challenger to existing businesses. Examples of useful cloud solutions include accounting software and virtual file archives Added to the competitive mix is globalisation, which essentially means that your biggest rival could just as easily be in another continent as in the same town. Again, communications and logistics have evolved to such a degree that even the smallest businesses have a global outlook. This has had a knock-on effect on working environments, particularly in the last five years. Businesses now need to be able to accommodate a steady flow of collaborators, remote workers, outsourced functions and freelancers. The short story is your business must be agile, and to be agile you must be connected. But research commissioned by Canon suggests many businesses are yet to wake up to the crucial advantages of becoming a connected organisation. The survey, involving more than 1,000 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) across Europe , showed that attitudes towards developments such as cloud computing could be outdated. It revealed that just 18pc of SMEs believe cloud-based solutions are best for their business, compared with a European-wide average of 31pc. Technology first: the cloud is a leading example of how business can become better connected Photo: Getty The findings buck a positive trend in the UK for digital adoption. The country has advanced broadband infrastructure and has been applauded by international bodies for its rollout of high-speed internet into rural areas, for example. It’s important that businesses adopt the same positive attitude to the cloud, which is the name given to a range of tools and services that enable greater sharing and collaboration online, meaning individuals can access and work on projects in real time. According to Mark Robinson, Market Business Developer at Canon: “Although many external challenges still exist that are beyond the control of business owners, such as political and economic climates, there is a myriad of technology solutions available to help deal with internal hurdles such as compliance, paperwork and IT management.” The short story is your business must be agile, and to be agile you must be connected Examples of useful cloud solutions include accounting software, virtual file archives and customer relationship management tools. There’s Evernote, which lets users bring work together in a single repository or digital workspace, which they can access by logging in from anywhere in the world. Microsoft’s OneDrive similarly enables users to access files from anywhere, store them and share them with others. The cloud is a leading example of how business can become better connected, enabling increasingly disparate workforces to convene, work, communicate, update and share in central hubs online. It is technology like this that will help businesses get ahead – UK SMEs should take note. Boost your business’s connectivity with Canon’s MAXIFY inkjet printer range.
