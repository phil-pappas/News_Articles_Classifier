If the crack led all the way up until the top, it was a day project.\n'That means that we started at the bottom of the wall in the morning and reached the top at some point in the afternoon. And of course to get back to the ground would take us a few hours too.'\nRELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next British holidaymaker in intensive care in Ibiza after diving...

Share this article Share Rahel said: 'I guess with every route we climbed there we learned a new way of climbing. Once we started a climb the only way was to get to the top which forced us to use all our imagination and creativity to find a way to overcome the difficulties.\n'Widening cracks are rather challenging climbs and therefore only a few climbers like them. Most climbers prefer parallel cracks. I like all kinds of cracks - therefore I would go for a widening crack from time to time too.\n'Crack climbing demands a certain amount of pain resistance. If you don't want to sacrifice a little of your skin or a pair of pants, you shouldn't start crack climbing.'\nmore videos 1 2 3 Watch video A look at the beautiful historic Tuscan city of Lucca\nWatch video Janice Dickinson has fit after allergic reaction to insect bite\nWatch video Is this the saddest little bookworm in the world?\nWatch video French tourist Natalie Amyot looking for father of unborn child\nWatch video Ellie Goulding pleads with fans after fight breaks out at gig\nWatch video Police step in to stop Notting Hill Carnival fight\nWatch video Watch: Miley's reaction to Nicki Minaj calling her a b****\nWatch video United new boy Anthony Martial stunning volley vs St Etienne\nWatch video Afghanistan TV broadcast Woman receiving 100 lashes\nWatch video Nowhere Left To Run - Coronation Street's LIVE hour episode\nWatch video Cat is extremely jealous of owners new pet pooch\nWatch video Chloe Jasmine cries over fears she and Stevi will split up\nOver 25 days she climbed around 60 routes, ranging from crevices 20 to 30 metres high to cracks that stretched all the way from the bottom to the top of the rock face\nRahel Schelb, 33, climbing one of the huge cracks in the Li Ming region, in Yunnan Province, China\nFaced with a mixture of widening and narrowing cracks presented a different challenge to what Rahel is used to back home in Switzerland.\nRahel, who works as a teacher, said: 'In Switzerland are not that many cracks so it might feel harder for us because we are not used as American climbers would be.\n'In crack climbing you use your hands differently compared to the normal climbing where you use holds to climb a route.\n'You try to jam your hand in the crack. If the size of the crack fits to the size of your hand, that works quite well.\n'If the crack is smaller you use your fingers only trying to jam them. If the crack widens then it gets harder.\n'For example I figured out that sometimes I can even use my elbow to jam. Or the whole arm. Sometimes you have half of your shoulder in the crack, trying to jam somehow.\nAlthough the Swiss climber secures ropes as she progresses up the rock, the work is done by hauling herself by cracks in the surfaces\nRahel said she rates Li Ming among the best locations in the world for crack climbing\n'But if the crack becomes that wide, that's when we worried most, because it didn't feel very safe. And sometimes we had no idea how we should be able to get up there. But somehow we finally figured out a good jam that worked.\n'Sometimes we reached the top after an hour of fighting, feeling completely exhausted and with torn pants.\n'But I guess it was most satisfying to reach the top of a route after a hard fight, hardly believing that it's possible for us to get up that crack.\n'These are these moments that stay in our memories for a long time. 'I guess that's part of the fascination in climbing. If it was very easy it wouldn't be as satisfying as a route that is earned by a hard fight.\n'As a climber it's all about challenging yourself. The harder you fight, the sweeter the success.'\nMs Schelb is happy battling her way to the top of the rocks, saying 'the harder you fight, the sweeter the success'\nLi Ming region, in Yunnan Province has some beautiful, and yet daunting rocks that provide a stiff test for climbers\nRahel said she rates Li Ming among the best locations in the world for crack climbing.\nShe said: 'Li Ming is a perfect spot for various crack climbing routes. I found some of the best crack routes I've ever climbed.\n'You can easily reach all these walls by foot and there is a huge number of amazing cracks to climb. That's what makes it so special, that you have so many different cracks in a small area.\n'You can find easy cracks as well as some of the hardest cracks in the world. And compared to famous crack climbing spots like Indian Creek in Utah you would find way steeper, often overhanging cracks in beautiful colored sandstone. We definitely found a paradise.'", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1UnrCbN", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2015-08-31T23:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:16:20.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
