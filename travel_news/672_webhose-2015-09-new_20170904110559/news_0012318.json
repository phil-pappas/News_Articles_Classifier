Most of the bottom 10 - including Eritrea, the deadliest driving destination, according to the World Health Organization's figures (with 48.4 deaths per 100,000 residents), Libya (40.5) and Iraq (31.5) - are unlikely to feature on the travel itineraries of most Britons. But a couple - Thailand (38.1) and South Africa (31.9) - are popular holiday destinations. Relatively risky roads can also be found in Ecuador, Vietnam, Brazil, Paraguay, Kenya and Laos. San Marino, the safest place in the world to travel by car Photo: AP/FOTOLIA Other notable findings include the fact that Portugal is less safe than the rest of Western Europe and the US is twice as dangerous as Canada. Eritrea, the least safe Photo: GETTY The safest places to drive include the Maldives (1.9 deaths, though the lack of roads probably helps), Norway (2.9), Denmark (3), Sweden (3) and Switzerland (3.4). Britain is just behind, with only 3.5 fatalities per 100,000 inhabitants per year. But they are all outshone by San Marino, which recorded not a single death for the year in question (2010).
