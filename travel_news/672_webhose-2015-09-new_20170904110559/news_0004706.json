We are tired and weary, but incredibly happy. Actually we might find some extra energy to celebrate as well,\" Garfors, Pak and Djupvik say. \nHaving traveled large parts of America for the last 24 hours, the frenetic record journey ended in Illinois 21 September 06.20 Eastern Time. \nAfter the trio embarked on the road from Maine Sunday morning, they managed to visit New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Alabama, North Carolina, Mississippi, Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky - and finally Illinois. \nMost of the touring had been done by car with Øystein Djupvik behind the wheel, but the guys also made use of three short commercial plane trips. And it was actually the flights that really caused trouble for the RecordrunUSA crew. \n\"We got a bad flight delay midway on the trip, and this threatened to jeopardize the whole record attempt. Fortunately we had prepared ourselves for such situations, and managed to reorganize so we did not lose too much time. But it was a close call,\" driver Øystein Djupvik admits. \nTay-young Pak has been responsible for cooking and photo documentation during the frenetic tour. From the backseat of The RecordrunUSA car, he juggled lobster dishes and camcorders. As well as feeding the official web-page with news. \n\"Good food has been important to keep morale up along the way. We are also obliged to take picture of ourselves in each state for documentations, so I´ve had my hands full. But we could not have completed this enormous task without the support of our sponsor, international betting company comeon.com. They have as much hand in this success as I have,\" Tay smiles. \nNow the fresh world record holders will head back to RecordrunUSA's headquarters in New York City. \n\"In NYC we will meet up with our sponsor comeon.com and celebrate a bit. At least until we fall asleep,\" Gunnar Garfors laughs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T05:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T05:12:36.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
