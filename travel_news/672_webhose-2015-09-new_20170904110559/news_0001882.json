Dean Potter’s extreme jump \nExtreme American climber and base jumper Dean Potter, 43, known for stunts such as walking barefoot on a rope connected between two mountain peaks in Enshi, Hubei province in China, took it a step too far earlier this year when he and fellow extreme athlete Graham Hunt, 29, decided to jump off a cliff in Yosemite National Park. \nDespite wearing wingsuits designed to help them fly clear of an outcrop on the cliff face, the pair failed to get past it, and tragically plunged to their death jumping from a spot 915 metres above the valley floor. \nIn 2008, Potter told The New York Times that while a part of him thought it was crazy for a person to attempt to fly, “another part of me thinks all of us had the dream that we can fly. Why not chase after it?” \n2. The “Death Swing” at Hanging Rock \nOnly a week ago, Aussie daredevil Toby Benham, 32, known as Lucky Chance, fatally smashed into jagged rocks at Hanging Rock, Blackheath, while trying to complete a Blue Mountains clifftop stunt known as the “Death Swing”. Hanging Rock, Blackheath ... Scene where Toby Benham, aka Lucky Chance, died. Picture: Supplied Source: The Daily Telegraph \nAs a former Lennon Brothers Circus performer, he spent weeks recovering in a French hospital from another cliff jump gone wrong about four years ago, where broke his pelvis, his lung collapsed and he was in a coma. \nThis time, however, he wasn’t as lucky. \nHanging Rock, where Lucky Chance died, is a popular location for rope swinging. Tragic end ... Toby Benham also known as \"Lucky Chance\" who was killed after swinging from a rope attached to Hanging Rock in the Blue Mountains. Source: Facebook \n3. A near-drowning \nEscape artist Spencer Horsman’s public performance at the State Theater in New Jersey last night went seriously wrong after he got into massive trouble while performing his “Water Torture Cell” stunt, which includes Horsman submerging himself, wrapped in metal chains, in a see-through glass and metal box filled with water. \nHe and the box are hoisted into the air as he is supposed to be freeing himself.

Four men then rushed over to unlock the box and quickly dragged his limp body out. He was rushed to the hospital soon after.

Driving through fire \nWhen one daredevil thought it’d be clever to lie down on the outside of a jeep and have someone drive it through a burning wall, he probably thought, what could go wrong? \nPlenty. After crashing through the burning wall, the stuntman was lit on fire, he panicked, and let go of the car before he fell down on the ground and is run over by a car. \nCuriously, the stuntman appears unharmed and just walks off afterwards. Hmmm. Under the wheels ... The daredevil is shown being run over the car after the stunt goes horribly wrong. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \nHere’s the full video, courtesy of Fox Sports : \n5. The drunk trampoline bounce \nConsidering that most daredevil stunts are extremely dangerous, going into them drunk adds just another layer of insanity. \nSo when UK prankster Jordan Adlard, 26, decided to jump off a very high tree and onto a trampoline at a party while drunk, it’s a miracle he even survived. \nKnown as the “human cannonball”, Adlard was at his cousin’s party when he decided to leap onto a trampoline from a six metre tree. \nWhile it’s not clear what he expected to happen, the result was pretty tragic: he bounced off and smashed into a wooden fence, breaking his back. \nBut wait for the kicker: he didn't actually find that out until eight days later, after he went to the hospital following a breakdancing episode which finally revealed the pain. \nAccording to The Mirror , doctors told Adlard that he had in fact suffered a compression fracture in his spine, which would have almost certainly become permanently damaged had he waited much longer. \n6. Vlogger condemned for act of ‘stupidity’ \nYouTuber Shah Faisal Shinwari has been widely condemned by various emergency services in the UK for a ‘prank’ video where he jumped off Tower Bridge, London, before getting into trouble while swimming to the banks of the Thames. \nThe stunt took place on July 16 but attracted local attention from July 23 this year when Shinwari uploaded edited footage from the day to his YouTube channel, Carnage. \nShinwari wrote: “I will be donating EVERYTHING I earn from this Tower Bridge Jump to @RNLI.” \n7. Daredevil cliff-jumper escapes waves \nOn a visit to friends in New South Wales, this American group were brought on a cliff-jumping adventure. \nEnjoying the moment, Pat decided he’d be first to take a leap into the ocean below. \nBut fun and games were soon swept aside as the daredevil found himself in real danger. Massive waves engulfed him and pushed him off the rocks to which he clung. \nBefore he was swept away, fortunately, he managed to clamber to safety. \n8. Surfer’s Wipeout on ‘World’s Heaviest Wave’ \nThe video below shows surfer Niccolo Porcella amid a massive wipe-out as a huge wave comes crashing down on him on Teahupo’o beach on the French Polynesian island of Tahi \nPorcella falls off his board and is picked up by the gigantic wave, churned in its barrel before he is slammed down on top of his surf board. \nThe beach is famous of its massive waves, and daring surfers have long since attempted stunts there. \nOn July 22, pro surfer Jamie O’Brien lit himself on fire and rode the massive barrel at Teahupo’o. \nFeeling beyond!! with a lot of FuzionFit Inc training and some heavenly angels, I escaped some serious injury on that... Posted by Niccolo Porcella on Friday, 24 July 2015 \n9. The river slip \nIf practice does indeed make perfect, then it looks as though this adventurous guy might need to try a few more running jumps at this river. \nHis attempt to clear the water in just one leap appeared to be going smoothly right up until the last moment where, rather than landing on two feet on the other side, a slip backwards sent him rolling into the water behind. \nAmusing, yet could have resulted in serious repercussions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T09:09:08.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
