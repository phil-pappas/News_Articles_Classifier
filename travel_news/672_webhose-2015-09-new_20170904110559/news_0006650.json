Share article \nUpon speaking to the driver, the man said he was given fake rings in exchange for cash to buy petrol . \nHowever, upon refusal of this offer and a suggestion that the motorist was a con-man, the supposedly-stranded driver sped off. The man posted: “Luckily, they seemed to have just enough fuel to disappear when they were rumbled.” Promoted Stories Warning to drivers over possible scam on motorways   OSPREYSAINT 11:06am Fri 18 Sep 15 \nPalmistry could probably provide the answer?

My partner got caught out a few years ago in the Heathrow services on the M4, approached by a sobbing woman who hadn't enough fuel to get home. Partner accepted her driving license as surety for a £25 sub, as you can guess the driving license was stolen and she (partner) accepted the fact that she'd been stung, swore she'd never help out a stranger again (which was the really sad part) and moved on. A few months later we stopped at the same place, and partner recognised the same woman doing the same thing. (She had been alone the first time) so I let the woman approach me and I agreed to fill her car with fuel with her license as a surety. She really wanted money but I said that all I had was a card, but that I'd buy her a tank of fuel. She filled her tank, I went in to pay, but I didn't pay for fuel, only bought a mars bar. As I came out to get her driving license she drove off with a screech of tyres. She got nicked further up the road for making off without paying for the fuel, which I thought was justice.
