(Pramod Thakur/HT photo) \nNeil Nitin Mukesh is not one to follow trends. For him, style is all about being comfortable in your own skin. As the actor leads us to his closet, he reveals that he’s such an impulsive shopper, he doesn’t actually try clothes on before buying them. In fact, he’s never visited a trial room in a store. Also, the actor loves lazing around at home in boxers and T-shirts. At times, though, he likes to dress snazzy and might even put on ethnic wear if his friends come over. \nColour scheme : “I am attracted to darker shades, though, with my skin tone, I can carry off lighter colours too. I personally like pastels and understated colours such as greys, whites and browns.” \nGo-to designer : “I’ve always loved Narendra Kumar Ahmed’s designs. He knows my body type and my style. I feel confident wearing his creations.” \nComfort clothing : “When nobody is around, I am usually in my boxers and torn T-shirts. My dog has bitten and torn most of my T-shirts, but I love them nonetheless. They’re very comfortable.” \nNeil Nitin Mukesh lets us into his closet. (Pramod Thakur/HT photo) \nBeing desi : “I prefer Indian designs because they are graceful and elegant. I wear western outfits on a day-to-day basis. So, for special occasions, I stick to Indian wear. You will catch me in a Pathani suit at home if I have a few friends coming over.” \nImpulsive shopper : “I don’t like shopping for clothes. I find the process tedious because I am impulsive by nature. I usually pick up 10 things without trying them on.” \nBiggest splurge : “Once, my brother and I desperately needed some gym wear. So, we went to a Superdry store and picked up a couple of track suits. The amount on the bill was huge; it was shocking, especially since we had just purchased regular T-shirts.” \nOnline shopping : “I usually surf online when my father is travelling. Then, I mail him the list so he can pick it up. Most of my phone covers are from a website called elementcase.com.” \nMost attached to : “I like collecting watches. My grandfather’s watch collection is priceless to me. It includes brands such as Audemars Piguet, Hublot, Rolex and Cartier. It’s a fetish. I can’t leave home without a watch.” \nNeil's prized watch collection (Pramod Thakur/HT photo) \nClose call : “Once, for an intercollegiate dance event, we had to wear a dhoti and mojaris for a sequence. However, I forgot my mojaris and had to go on stage in a pair of hideous boots. I still have a few photos from that event. It was embarrassing.” Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T19:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T18:02:50.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
