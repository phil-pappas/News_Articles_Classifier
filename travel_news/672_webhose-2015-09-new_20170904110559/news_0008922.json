The couple is also pursuing a civil lawsuit against the house sitter. \n“We have zero tolerance for this sort of fraudulent activity,” Airbnb told Business Insider in a statement. \nTrusted Housesitter told The Guardian that because the couple didn’t use its on-site messaging tool to reach out to the house sitter, it was harder to investigate the complaint beyond deleting the profile. \nThe couple, for their part, said that next time they’ll just recruit some friends to look after their apartment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T17:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T20:26:31.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
