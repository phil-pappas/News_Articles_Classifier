Get there aboard the world’s first mountain-climbing cog railway. Take the first run of the day for a steam-engine ride (three hours round-trip). In clear weather, you can see as far as Canada and the Atlantic Ocean. Dress warmly: temperatures at the summit drop dramatically.

In the Main House, the 1795 House and the Carriage House, the 19 rooms have bags of character and romance. “Music” has a four-poster bed and fireplace; “Rose” overlooks the gardens and woods. Relax on the veranda, with views of the White Mountains, and dine in the sophisticated restaurant. Rates include afternoon tea and breakfast. Double rooms from £110. (001 802 748 5168; rabbithillinn.com ) The Notchland Inn, Hart’s Location, New Hampshire Start with a 150-year-old Cotswold-style manor house deep in the White Mountain National Forest. Add oh-so-comfy bedrooms, a small restaurant and a low-key atmosphere: the result is a retreat where guests return year after year. Most of the rooms have real fireplaces, with logs provided. Start with a fulsome breakfast; hike up a mountain; explore the inn’s 100 acres; admire the gardens; take time over the five-course dinner. Double rooms from £130. (001 603 374 6131; notchland.com ) The Deerfield Inn, Deerfield, Massachusetts In a wide-open valley, one of New England’s prettiest towns is home to this 130-year-old inn, whose porches look over the main street, with its 18th and 19th-century homes. Eleven of the 24 bedrooms are in the main inn; the rest are in the carriage house. The owners embrace the farm-to-fork movement, so you’ll enjoy local produce, home-baked breads and maple syrup from their own trees. Double rooms from £100. (001 413 774 5587; deerfieldinn.com ) • The best hotels in Boston Rangeley Inn & Tavern, Rangeley, Maine Deep in the Mountains and Lakes region, this inn has been the hub of village life for more than a century. Of the 30 rooms, those dubbed “Traditional” are cosy, while the Tavern Wing has a more spacious, contemporary feel. In Haley Pond Lodge, a newly decorated annexe, the simply furnished rooms have private porches overlooking the water. Eat in the tavern, with its wooden floors, original tin ceiling and menus using local ingredients. Double rooms from £65. (001 207 864 3341; therangeleyinn.com ) • Boston city break guide The Inn at Manchester, Vermont At the foot of Mount Equinox, this handsome, 19th-century home and carriage house is a fine base from which to explore southern Vermont by car or bike. Of the 21 rooms, 12 are suites. Each is different; all have hand-made quilts and modern bathrooms. Antiques and oil paintings lend a “British country house” atmosphere – but, at breakfast, the buttermilk pancakes are all-American. Double rooms from £100. (001 802 362 1793; innatmanchester.com ) Drink Mount Washington Resort This grande-dame hotel in New Hampshire is named for – and looks straight at – the tallest peak in the north-eastern US. Order a Mount Washington Organic Amber Ale and savour the view from a wicker chair on the veranda, just as great names from the past have done, including Sir Winston Churchill. (001 603 278 1000; brettonwoods.com ) Eat White Mountain Cider Company Set in an 1880s New Hampshire farmhouse, this restaurant follows the seasons, using New England’s bounty from land and sea. In autumn, cider (non-alcoholic) from its own cider mill is the star attraction. At dinner, start with a cider martini; explore a menu featuring pork, chicken or even calamari cooked with cider. Finish with chef/owner Teresa Stearns’s feather-light cider doughnuts, partnered by caramel sauce and ice cream.
