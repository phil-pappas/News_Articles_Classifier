Designed specifically and exclusively for the SmartTOP modules, this new, slimmer enclosure allows installation in very tight spots in the car while two integrated LEDs show the module status and help during the installation phase.“The new product design of our SmartTOP Convertible Top ( http://www.mods4cars.com ) modules now matches the sophistication of the product internals.” says PR Manager Sven Tornow. The smart Convertible Top add-on modules make use of the top on a daily basis more fun and come with many convenient extra features. The SmartTOP makes it possible to open and close the roof on the Volvo C70 while driving up to 40 km/h (~28mph) with just a quick tap of a button. It is no longer required to pull over and hold down the switch for the duration of the operation. Additionally the top can be operated from the original key from remote. A quick key combination on the remote is all that is needed to start a full automatic top cycle. While the top is still opening, SmartTOP customers can get in and start driving. No changes are necessary to either the key remotes or the receiver system. Other than the two main features mentioned above, the SmartTOP comes with a host of configurable bonus features: All windows can be simultaneously and fully automatically closed via the “all windows” switch. An “extended mode” allows turning the ignition on or off while an ongoing top operation is allowed to continue. Turning off the ignition can be set to unlock the doors. The passenger mirror can be programmed to dip down in reverse gear. A safety feature can be activated that blinks the hazard blinkers during remote activated top operation. The entire module can be deactivated temporarily while retaining all other user configurable settings. The module comes with a standard USB port for quick and easy firmware updates via PC or Mac as well as computer based configuration of the module user settings. Support software and firmware updates are available online and free of charge. A plug-in-between wiring adapter is part of the kit. It allows for a simple and easy installation of the SmartTOP module in the car by just connecting the module to the car electronics in two steps. The SmartTOP Convertible Top Controller kit for Volvo C70 is available for 249 Euros + tax.
