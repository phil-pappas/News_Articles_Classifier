A sunset at any Mayan site is no small thing, and as we strolled across the lawns there was only the sublime serenity of a day’s ending: red-lored parrots flapping home, ocellated turkeys browsing for one last meal, the Temple of the Great Jaguar turning a warm golden colour as our closest star did its thing. It was, therefore, much to the chagrin of my guide, Luis, when 20 or so local children began playing on a steep slope on the southern edge of the plaza. They were running to the top and, on reaching the walls of an old palace, collapsing in a fit of giggles and rolling down the hill. “It’s funny,” Luis said, smiling sadly, “but it’s also a little disrespectful. This is a place of history and heritage.” • Central America's best Mayan temples I understood, but didn’t share, Luis’s preoccupation. There was something quite lovely about the descendants of Mayans having fun in this ancestral square. An altar smoked with an offering. Folk music came from a far corner. Two men ate a snack. There were even a couple of Mexican Mormons gawping at the pyramids – the Latter Day Saints lot believe American Indians are descended from migrants from Israel. Ruins in Tikal, Guatemala Photo: Fotolia/AP The Mundo Maya – or Mayan world – is tourist trade shorthand for the 150,000 square miles of jungles, mountains and plains that stretch from Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula down to El Salvador. Right across this territory, the Maya established impressive cities between the third and 10th centuries. Promoted to tourists principally through Cancún’s beaches and the citadel at Chichen Itza, it was once one of the most advanced civilisations on Earth. I’d begun my journey at Mérida, a symbolically important city which was the cultural and commercial capital of Mexico’s Yucatán region until Cancún was developed in the Eighties. A graceful city melding urban graciousness with rural rhythms – with folk concerts on the main plaza throughout summer – it had grown rich on sisal: an agave hemp used to make rope, carpets, cloth and paper. • Cancún, Mexico: gateway to the partying and the pyramids “When the Spaniards came to the region, all they conquered were stones,” said Francisco, my Mexican guide. “If it hadn’t been for the sisal, a lot of the area might have been left unpopulated. We call the creole landowners the casta divina. There are just a handful of families – and they still run things around here.” He explained how they enslaved the Mayans and tied them, on feudal terms, to their estates and the back-breaking work of gathering the heavy, spiky leaves using their bare hands, under baking skies. The wealth created by their hard labour had built Mérida’s elegant mansions. A large cenote at the ruins of Chichen Itza Photo: Alamy We left these behind to visit Hacienda Sotuta de Peón, a working sisal ranch, kept open – if we’re honest – mainly for tourists. With its toy-town train, happy rustic workers and bloodless narrative, it was a sanitised version of history, but the old machinery demonstrated how a tough plant could be milled and spun into malleable and – back in the day – valuable fibres. At the estate’s cenote, I took a dip; the limestone plain of Yucatán is dotted with these sinkholes, which the Mayans believed to be sacred. This one was in a cave and rather magical and, with the outside temperature rising to around 40C, the cooling waters were welcome – and, I’m sure, off limits to the Mayans who once worked here. • Mexico: a date with mystical Mayan time lords I had a “casta divina” experience of my own, spending a couple of nights at the Hacienda San José Cholul, a luxury ranch-turned-hotel. Everything about the place was romantic: exuberant gardens, artfully distressed terracotta walls, an open-air restaurant serving Mexican‑Mayan fusion cuisine. The bedrooms had private plunge pools, and there were hammocks indoors as well as out on the patios. It would have been easy to have lain back with a copy of Popol Vuh and not bothered with any Mayan ruins – but that would have been a big mistake. A Mayan pyramid in Chichen Itza Photo: Fotolia/AP My first sight of a Mayan site was at Izamal. We’d stopped there to visit the vast monastery that the Franciscans had built in 1561 under the tutelage of Diego de Landa, a controversial conquistador-cum-cleric who was bishop of Yucatán. From a parapet, Francisco pointed to Mayan ruins on all sides. “The monastery was built on top of a Mayan temple,” he said. “It was here that John Paul II asked the indigenous peoples of the Americas to forgive the Europeans for their crimes.” • Mexico's Riviera Maya made easy A few minutes’ walk away was a park open to the public and free of charge. I climbed a short staircase and found myself standing on a huge grassy plaza looking up at the fifth‑highest pyramid in Mexico. Izamal’s pyramid to the Sun God, Kinich Kak Mo, could be as important as Chichen Itza if some restoration work were carried out. On the upside, it was very quiet, with just a few locals and Mexican tourists picnicking and ambling – in all the wrong kinds of footwear – around the monuments. The Kinich Kak Mo pyramid in Izamal Photo: Fotolia/AP Much of Dzibilchaltun, south of Mérida, had been destroyed for building materials by a Spanish entrepreneur in the Thirties. After the boom in sisal subsided, Yucatán was desperate for investment, even if that meant demolishing its heritage. Still, one major pyramid remains – and to get there we had to walk along a Mayan sakbe, or “white road” – a bit like Windsor’s Great Walk, but hotter. • Uxmal: Mexico's wondrous ancient Maya city The site also had a 16th-century church and a lovely cenote full of lily pads. On maps you can see many of these arranged in a giant circle – evidence, said Francisco, of the Chicxulub crater left by a massive asteroid that collided with Yucatán some 66 million years ago, marking the end of the dinosaurs. If you want cosmic and cataclysmic, Yucatán doesn’t disappoint. I crossed into Belize to see Caracol – my third trip to this country but my first in the area known as the Maya Mountains. A long, bumpy road wound first through fruit plantations and baking-hot bushland and finally in to a protected jungle, where, suddenly, we came to a magnificent city. The Pyramid of the Magician in Uxmal, south of Mérida Photo: Fotolia/AP Two stucco carvings of a jaguar emerging from the underworld indicated that high-grade artisans had lived here. Clouds of butterflies danced around the cat’s large teeth. Down in the plaza it was steamily hot, the temples were safe enough to clamber over, so I went to the top of the highest in search of a breeze. It was meagre, but I could see all the way to Guatemala. The broadleaved canopy was busy with bird life: I saw a keel‑billed toucan and heard a laughing falcon. • Mexico: readers' tips, recommendations and travel advice At Xunantunich, a second site in Belize, I sat for an hour watching a huge iguana posing in front of a frieze of Chaac on the western façade. Perhaps my ogling pleased the god, because, for the first time in 10 days, a proper shower arrived and soaked me to the skin. The howler monkeys barked and squealed in delight. Mayan ruins in Belize Photo: Fotolia/AP I was lucky enough to be in the Mundo Maya for the vernal equinox, when the temples become clocks and astrological devices. It added another layer of wonder to a Mayan story that is a tale of glory followed by the evils of colonisation, of enslavement on haciendas, of social exclusion and, finally, of resistance and linguistic revival. • Tulum, Mexico: Bohemian days on the Mayan Riviera Tikal, the mother of Mayan sites, was the ideal place to end my own short journey. It was very likely the most powerful metropolis of the period, and its size and scale leave you in no doubt that when the Saxons were wattle and daubing and the Vikings rowing and rampaging, here was a kingdom to be admired and a culture to envied. Tourism can never be wholly good for indigenous peoples, but compared to conquest, colonisation and the slavery of the sisal farms, now is quite a propitious time to be a Mayan. The religion may have been syncretised and the way of life altered beyond recognition, but there are great reserves of pride in the people, and a joyous sense of freedom and of ownership. In their way, the children rolling around the sacred plaza summed it up.
