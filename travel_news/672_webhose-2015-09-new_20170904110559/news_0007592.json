It has not yet been formally named by paleontologists who discovered it in Argentina in 2014. It belongs to a group known as titanosaurs.\nOn March 19, the museum also will open a new exhibition titled \"Dinosaurs Among Us.\" It will examine how one group of dinosaurs evolved into birds.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T19:38:08.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
