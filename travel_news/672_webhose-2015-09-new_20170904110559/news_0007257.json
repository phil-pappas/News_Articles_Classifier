About 90 per cent of the Nepalese population live in the mountains and the villages you visit along the trails through Everest and Annapurna, make for an unforgettable experience.\n“The Nepalese people are very warm, friendly and hospitable and if you visit their villages, they’ll welcome you with open arms,” World Expeditions CEO Sue Badyari says. “Many treks take you past villages where you can stop and visit monasteries, experience village life and the culture of the Nepalese.”\nThere’s a trek for all types of climbers.

She says travellers who have basic fitness and good health will find a Himalayan trek very rewarding.\n“I’m not saying it’s easy, even the basic treks represent a challenge of some sort. But, if you take it slow, stopping each night and getting a little higher every day, you will find it so gratifying. Our trekkers have the best support with porters to carry their luggage, cook their meals and comfortable accommodation along the way.”\nWhile large parts of the country can be described as being “undiscovered” by tourists, there are areas that are opening up to visitors. The landlocked district of Mustang, in the central west of the country, does not have any big mountain ranges, rather it features high altitude desert landscapes and fertile valleys. Because it’s close to the Tibetan border, it retains a traditional Tibetan Buddhist culture not seen in other parts of the country.\nThere is a strong Buddhist culture in Nepal.

During these months, the weather is consistently wet and uncomfortably hot as the heat rises up from the Bay of Bengal.\nThe peak season runs through the autumn months of September, October and November. However, Badyari says her favourite time to visit is during their winter (December to February) when rainfall is at its lowest point and mountain viewing at its best.\n“In the Nepalese winter the temperatures can drop to below-15C overnight but if you have good accommodation and appropriate layered clothing, it’s a fantastic time to visit,” she says. “The skies are really clear and you can see all the beautiful contours of the mountains.”\nBest time to book\nPrices for activities and accommodation remain fairly static year round in Nepal. However, travellers can save on airfares if they book for travel outside the peak period. Watch for airfare offers on Asian airlines that fly to the region.\nVisit monasteries and experience village life.
