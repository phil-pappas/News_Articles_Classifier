They took possession of the then-named Cascade Inn on June 25, 2014.\n They changed the name to AbbyCreek Inn , after their dog.\nThree weeks after they took possession last year, the wildfires came, burning about 400 square miles and 300 homes, including parts of the Methow Valley. That was the first hit.\nBut the couple, and the town, rebounded.\nThis summer, tourism season was heading to a grand finish toward Labor Day weekend.\nThen fires came again, raging through much of North Central Washington.\nJosh estimates the cancellations since Aug. 19 have been something like 400 or 450, despite Winthrop being back in business a few days after the evacuation.\nThe motel’s voice mail was full; the cancellation emails scrolled on and on.\nThey added up to $30,000, says Josh. No, no, says Kristin, more like $45,000 to $50,000.\n“Most people were really apologetic,” says Josh. “They’d say how they really wanted to come and were sad to hear what’s going on.”\nWinthrop , with its Old West-stylized shops in the center of town and wood boardwalks, is dependent on tourism.\n“We’re just dead. It’s like a ghost town. It looked like it was going to be a great year for tourism, and then, all of a sudden … ,” says Sue Langdalen, the town’s mayor.\nThere are about 7,000 people who live in the Methow Valley. When business is affected in Winthrop proper, or the nearby town of Twisp, it reverberates throughout the area.\nWildfire coverage Watch how state’s largest wildfires spread 3 firefighters killed: ‘big heroes protecting small towns’ How to help with wildfire-relief efforts in Washington Businesses throughout the town have suffered major financial losses over the past few weeks.\nThe fires this year never got near Winthrop, says Dave Gottula, president of the Winthrop Chamber of Commerce, but the effect was the same.\nAnd the gray skies, even in sunshine, told of smoke polluting the air to unhealthy levels. The interactive maps in media outlets pounded the message. People stayed away.\nBut hope is eternal in the tourism business.\nThe North Cascades Highway, Highway 20, is scheduled to reopen at noon on Sunday. It had been closed since the wildfires. A considerable number of tourists from the state’s westside, especially the all-important Seattle-area spenders, take that route, says the mayor.\nThe smoke is clearing, especially because of rain on Saturday. At one point, the Air Quality Index had reached 260 in Winthrop, and 273 in Twisp — “very unhealthy,” remembers Gene Westlund. The index then dropped into the low 100s, unhealthy for sensitive groups.\nThat was like Beijing, which has some of the most-polluted air in the world, says Westlund. On Saturday, Beijing was at 82, with nearby areas hovering at 112, 122.\nWestlund owns the 30-room Winthrop Inn right next to AbbyCreek, and on Thursday he had one room rented.\n“Normally we’d be full. This is pretty rough, this time around,” he said about the cancellations. “It’s a $30,000 hit for me. The last two years, I’ve never seen anything like it.”\nBut, says Westlund, he can’t really blame the tourists. He was wearing a mask through the first week of the smoke, even though not many locals were doing so. It doesn’t seem so bad when you’re in the middle of it.\nSheri and Doug Mohre started Sheri’s Sweet Shoppe at the main intersection of Winthrop some 22 years ago. They both used to work for the state transportation department, she as a field inspector, he as an engineer trainer.\n“We wanted to do something different,” says Doug about moving here from Seattle. He actually makes the candy but thought the business would do better named after a woman.\nOn a Sunday in the summer, Sheri’s would have 10 employees scooping up ice cream, making espressos.\nLast Sunday, says Sheri, “We opened with two employees and we were overstaffed.”\nWhen told that Highway 20 was scheduled to reopen, she exclaims, “You just gave me the best news ever. I’m surprised that people aren’t dancing in the streets.”\nPromoting tourism here is a low-budget operation. Town officials say they don’t track how many tourists come through. Last year’s advertising budget was all of $60,000 and it’ll be about the same this year, says Kristen Smith, marketing director for the chamber.\nThere isn’t a study that itemizes just how much tourism means to the local economy. There is the anecdotal.\nThe Evergreen IGA in Winthrop says business has been “cut in half” since the wildfire.\nHank’s Harvest Foods in Twisp says business “has definitely been affected.”\nMethow Cycle & Sport in Winthrop says business is down 85 percent.\nFor a town like Twisp, which is not as touristy and has service businesses like a Les Schwab tire store and plumbing and construction companies, it matters a lot if the owners of second homes don’t show up.\nThe Okanogan County Assessor’s Office says 50 percent of addresses of property owners in the area’s school district are located outside the county — people who have vacation homes. If their numbers drop off, that plumber or contractor will get less business.\nAt their near-empty motel, Josh and Kristin Buehler hope for the best, but the reality is that for the coming Labor Day weekend, on Friday they have only five rooms booked, and on Sunday, six rooms.\nSo they’ve cut back on staffing. They’ve postponed ordering some hotel supplies, and are bunching up rooms to clean instead of cleaning the moment they are empty.\nBut giving up is not the style of the entrepreneurs who started their tourism businesses here.\nTo get to this point, Josh, who grew up in Longview, had saved money since high school, ran a lawn-gardening business and also bucked hay. Later he held three jobs at the same time — at a bank call center, janitorial and selling windows.\nKristin, who grew up in Vancouver, Wash., had a full-time job as a massage therapist. The couple met while taking swing-dancing lessons, and married in 2011.\nPooling their money, they bought a house with 10 rooms in Long Beach, Pacific County, on the coast, and turned it into an inn. They did all the housekeeping, worked hard and on the third year made a pretty good profit.\nBut you keep on dreaming bigger dreams, and they found the AbbyCreek place that had run into financial problems and had only a fourth of the rooms ready to be rented.\n“We’re not afraid of work,” says Josh, and the couple began to fix the place up.\nIn 2014 they pushed through losing power because of wildfires, and pushed through bad weather that included a hailstorm that plugged up the downspouts.\nThe flat roof turned “into a swimming pool,” says Josh: Water started going through walls, and they had to cut through the spouts to let the water gush out.\nThere was a point last summer, says Kristin about having bought the motel, “in which we doubted we made the right decision.”\nNow it’s the summer of 2015, and this Quote: keeps cropping up about wildfires, “This could be the new normal.”\nSays Josh, “All we can do, is be hopeful.”\nErik Lacitis: 206-464-2237 or elacitis@seattletimes.com Twitter @ErikLacitis", "external_links": ["http://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=airnow.local_city&zipcode=98862&submit=Go", "http://www.twitter.com/ErikLacitis", "http://www.winthropinn.com/", "http://www.abbycreekinn.com/", "http://aqicn.org/city/beijing/", "http://www.winthropwashington.com/"], "published": "2015-08-30T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T05:18:29.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
