Having this car was already heading for trouble, breaking the rules of the establishment, driving a car I was definitely not born in to. 'Blue Lena' had carried us on many an acid-fuelled journey.\" Speed junkies can also get behind the wheels of racing classics, including an original Scarab-Offenhauser Formula 1 single-seater from 1960 and a 1970 Porsche 908/03 Sports Racing Prototype.
