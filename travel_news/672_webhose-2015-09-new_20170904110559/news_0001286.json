What is good design? These are questions vanguard interior designer Jim Walrod poses with his new show, “Difficult,” at Tribeca’s R & Company gallery, opening tonight. Pairing 21 examples of iconic furniture, like Charles Eames’s LCW Chair and Studio 65’s Marilyn lip-shaped sofa, with historical film spots and newspaper clippings that mocked their contemporaries for their unexpected shapes and unprecedented materials, Walrod traces the trajectory of how something that starts as a laughingstock can become highly coveted. “The entire show is basically based on an episode of The Odd Couple , called ‘Take My Furniture, Please,’ where it shows how uncomfortable society was with these things that looked like they belonged in the future. There’s a review of Frank Gehry’ s Easy Edge furniture where they just call it garbage. There’s a New York Times article on Memphis saying ‘Thank God it’s gone’—now it’s come back into favor,” says Walrod, who owns many of the once-hated pieces in the show and has tracked down countless others for the blue-chip clients who rely on him for his aesthetic foresight.\nThe tie that binds the chairs, settees, lamps, clocks, and vases in the exhibition, created as recently as 2002, is that “along the lines, history kind of shook out that they became important,” says Walrod. How? “I actually don’t know. That’s why I did the show.” To answer this question, he asked his design-savvy friends, from skaters ( Kids actor Leo Fitzpatrick ) to musicians (Sonic Youth’s Lee Ranaldo ) and curators ( Beatrice Galilee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art), to contribute Quote: s about their own initial reactions to the work. “Lee [Ranaldo] comments on the idea that the first time he saw a Rietveld [Zig-Zag] chair he thought it was the most uncomfortable thing in the world. It’s made out of plywood, it’s not upholstered. If I didn’t know what it was and looked at it, I’d say, ‘You want me to sit in that in your living room and [relax]?’ In truth, this is the first, most pure and elegant example of where modernism could lead. It probably became the most influential chair of the 20th century. Now Ranaldo says, ‘Man, I wish I had one of those things—I’d smoke a joint in it.’ ” Walrod’s hope is that pedestrians approaching the Franklin Street space will simply see a roomful of beautiful things, then be shocked to find their early pop cultural reviews. The learning process, he says, “[is] as helpful to me as an interior designer as it is to the general public.”\nHere, Walrod walks us through four of today’s most sought-after chairs and the film clips that will make you think twice before snickering at where design might be headed next.\n“The boxing ring is hysterical—it’s a living room. There were probably only four or five of them made. Anyone who saw it mocked it hard. It’s seen as such an iconic thing now, such a pure moment of Memphis and Postmodernism. You can lean against the ropes, you can do the same things as you can do as far as a chair. There are lights that are extended so you can sit and read. It was actually in Karl Lagerfeld’ s house in Monte Carlo. The group of designers forming Memphis was constantly photographed sitting in the middle of it. It’s a large sofa pit. It is furniture.”\n“In the film Ruthless People with Danny DeVito from 1986, he hates his wife—he’s trying to murder her. She’s designed his house completely in Memphis furniture—it’s layered on top of one another in this mocking way. He runs around the house, looking disgusted, tripping over it, and ends up sitting in an Ettore Sottsass chair, exhausted.”\n“Gaetano Pesce—our living genius as far as I’m concerned. He is a designer who worked within a realm of very controlled, very designed furniture. He designed furniture for Knoll, Cassina, and at one point he decided that he didn’t want to deal with anyone anymore, and he learned how to pour this furniture on his own. This was limited edition—I think there were 100 made—with Etro fabrics in it. It’s free-form Expressionist furniture. The first time I saw [his work], I was in Moss and there were three heads of museums standing next to me and saying, ‘He’s lost his mind.’ ‘What is he doing?’ And I thought it was the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen in my life. I was thinking, ‘Give me more of that .’ ”\n“In the movie Diamonds Are Forever , there’s an amazing scene from the John Lautner house. There are two female villains who are sitting in chairs—a Pierre Paulin Ribbon chair and a Gaetano Pesce Up 5, which is the form and shape of a woman. One of the women rolls out of it and says to Sean Connery , ‘Hi, I’m Bambi’ before kicking his ass.”\n“This stopped traffic when it was introduced in the fifties. It’s a center pedestal chair on the star-shaped base. People said it looked like it was made out of pieces of plumbing fixtures. But it freed the way so that chairs no longer had to have four legs.”\n“There’s an amazing episode of The Odd Couple dedicated to mocking what was then contemporary furniture called ‘Take My Furniture, Please,’ where Felix decorates the house in every single piece of furniture that I would kill to have now—Pierre Paulin’s Tongue chair to the Potato Chip chair. All they do is show how uncomfortable everything is and how much Oscar just wants his old furniture back.”\n“I’ve actually seen this chair do damage. Women will never sit in it if they have a dress on. When they stand up, it looks like they have cellulite all over the back of their legs. I’ve had old men ask, ‘What are you going to use this thing for, a barbecue grill?’ It’s seen as something really beautiful and iconic now—sculptural; light passes through it.”\n“Furniture like this is constantly mocked in Mon Oncle , the Jacques Tati film. It’s very still, there are women sitting on these things and they can’t get comfortable. It’s a complete indictment of this type of furniture, that is very pulled back and directly to the line of more is less.”", "external_links": ["http://www.r-and-company.com/"], "published": "2015-09-09T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T02:25:36.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
