(AP) â€” Officials say a carnival-themed amusement park in Cave City has been closed due to code violations.\nMultiple media outlets report city officials cordoned off the area around Funtown Mountain on Tuesday and put up signs stating that the park is closed to the public.\nThe roadside attraction is owned by Louisville businessmen Will Russell .\nThe city's public works director Robert Smith says Russell destroyed numerous pieces of the buildings and made it unsafe for the public. Smith says he has issued several code enforcement citations against Russell, all of which deal with maintaining the upkeep of the property and keeping it safe and sanitary.\nRussell tells WHAS-TV that his theme park is still open despite the reported violations. Russell says damage to the park's buildings isn't vandalism but his artwork.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T21:24:35.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
