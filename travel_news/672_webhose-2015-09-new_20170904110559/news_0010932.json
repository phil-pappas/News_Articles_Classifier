The portal is affiliated with 2.57 lakh hotels globally, including boutique establishments as well as big chains rated from three to five stars. \nAccording to the report, the average price paid by travellers for a night between January and June in the city rose from Rs7,694 to Rs8,091 – the most expensive in the country. The increase in Mumbai hotels rates was also higher than the national average of 2%. \nRoom tariff at other metros such as Delhi (-3%), Hyderabad (-3%) and Kolkata (-2%), however, fell, stated the report. Domestic tourist hotspots such as Goa (3%) and Jaipur (4%) also saw a price rise smaller than Mumbai, according to the report. \nLast year, Goa had recorded the highest increase with a 12% hike in rates. \n“Over the past one year, Mumbai has witnessed hotels rates holding firm when compared to other cities and this is because of an increase in demand because we see a pick-up in the economy, operational costs of hotels, etc. There are various factors affecting the price fluctuations of hotel bookings throughout the country and local government taxes amongst them are one such factor. This difference affects the room tariffs across states,” said Amit Agarwal, senior marketing manager, Hotels.com. \nHe added that the city offers a variety of options for travellers. “There is a lot to explore as the city has a great mix of varied cultures, cuisine, sightseeing, etc. Whether it’s relishing street food in the city’s most loved beaches or grooving to live music at its hottest clubs, Bollywood studio tours, the list of things to do in Mumbai is endless for travellers.” Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T17:42:28.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
