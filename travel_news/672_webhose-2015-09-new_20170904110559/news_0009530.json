The nominal yield and PASK were up 10.4% and 11,0% respectively. In August 2015 the currency adjusted PASK is expected to be in line with last year.\nSAS scheduled traffic development in July\nSAS strategy is to focus on Scandinavia’s frequent travelers. During the summer months the travel pattern amongst frequent travelers changes toward more leisure oriented destinations. Customers have responded well to SAS seasonal destinations, primarily offered to southern European destinations, while demand was slightly lower for traveling within Scandinavia in August.\nScheduled capacity was decreased by 0.3% and traffic was down by 1.1%, which resulted in a 0.7 p.u. lower load factor of 80.5%.\nSAS intercontinental capacity was increased by 1,0% but the traffic was down 1.8% with load factors still at 90%. While SAS decreased its capacity on European/ Intrascandinavian routes by 2.3%, traffic only fell 0.6% due to positive response to the seasonal routes. Domestic traffic was down 1.2%.
