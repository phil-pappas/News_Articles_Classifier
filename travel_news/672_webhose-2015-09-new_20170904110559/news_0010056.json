We have five on tap! \nCheeca Lodge & Spa , Florida Keys, Fla. \nPhoto: Handout \nHost your own hybrid Conch Republic secession/Labor Day party at Islamorada’s heavily palm-fronded resort through Monday, where rooms start at just $199 per night. They’ll throw in free meals and dessert for children under 12 with each purchase of an adult entree, $100 credit for water sports or Camp Cheeca, and other gift shop vouchers. \nHilton Anatole , Dallas, Texas \nPhoto: Handout \nRunning back DeMarco Murray left some kinda void when he ditched the Cowboys and set sail for Philly, giving you the perfect excuse to bunker down at the Anatole while you try out for his former job. The hotel’s Stay & See Dallas offer, starting at $194 a night over Labor Day weekend, includes room, daily breakfast, Wi-Fi and in-room movie with snackage for up to four guests. It’s an average nightly savings of $100. \nCopamarina Beach Resort & Spa , Guanica, Puerto Rico \nPhoto: Handout \nThe highlights of this lush, southern resort (a healthy two-hour drive from SJ’s cray cray) include crash-ready hammocks, day-trippy boat rides, outdoor movie nights (with popcorn), s’mores tastings and a giant Kraken-looking tree. But over Labor Day, it’s the rate that shines: just $175 per night, with daily breakfast for two, a 25 percent-off discount on water sports rentals and spa treatments, and 15 percent off at Las Palmas Café. \nThe InterContinental Toronto Centre , Canada \nPhoto: Handout \nWe all know you’re married to America — but your Ashley Madison “friend” will forever be Canada. Not only can you score a 25 percent bump cashing dollars into loonies, but once you land, the whole city will also throw itself at you for free: An outdoor moving screening at the Harbourfront Centre; Artfest (Sept. 4-7); Distillery Sunday Market (Sept. 6); the newly opened 15,000-square-foot Toronto Island labyrinth. Yes, all of the above = free. Top it all off by booking the family-fun Time Out in T.O. package at the InterContinental Toronto Centre, which includes accommodations for two adults and two kids, selfie stick and sunblock on arrival, breakfast for all, popcorn-catered movie night, and “spa dollars.” From $229 per night. \nGrand Lucayan , The Bahamas \nPhoto: Handout \nWhat’s better than spending $91 on a room in the tropics? Spending just $90 on one. That’s what it will run you at this 542-room classic and easy-to-reach playpen when you book now (and they’ll throw in a $125 resort credit, which seems mathematically challenged). It’s good for stays through Nov. 15, well before the Grand Lucayan births its all-inclusive enclave, Lighthouse Pointe, in December. Talk about cheap Labor! \nMore from New York Post:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T07:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T08:24:46.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
