The in-flight concierge is the latest move in what seems to be Etihad's quest to turn its airliners into fully-fledged luxury hotels.\nResidence suites have a living room with a 32-inch flat-screen TV, a bedroom with a double bed draped in Egyptian cotton sheets, and a carpeted hallway which leads to an en-suite bathroom with a shower, bathrobes and high-end toiletries.\nEtihad says the first person to fly on board The Residence had no complaints.\nIn fact, the airline's PR machine Quote: d Gino Bertuccio describing his trip, somewhat improbably, as \"beyond anybody's imagination.\"\n\"After returning home, I was living again minute by minute this fantastic journey I was lucky to live,\" he added\n\"When we launched The Residence by Etihad last year, we wanted to challenge the conventions in commercial air travel,\" says Peter Baumgartner, Etihad's chief commercial officer. \"The Etihad Lifestyle Concierge service is a continuation of that ambition.\"\nBaumgartner says it serves passengers who are stretched for time: \"For example, if they were unable to make any preparations before traveling, or need something unexpectedly.\n\"It also suits passengers who are looking for something out of the ordinary, perhaps a unique gift for a loved one, such as a rare blue diamond, \"he says.\nIs it a gimmick?\nFor some airline industry experts, Etihad's latest move is little more than a gimmick.\n\"Frankly I think the concierge service offered by Etihad is style over substance,\" says Ben Schlappig, a connoisseur of major airlines' first-class experiences and author of popular aviation blog One Mile at a Time .\n\"Ultimately I doubt this will be much more valuable than services offered by many top-end credit cards, and likely won't have the local expertise or clout of a top hotel concierge.\n\"Presumably people dropping $20,000 plus on a one-way ticket already have access to other concierge services,\" he adds.\nBut Baumgartner insists that as people travel further and more often, the time spent on the journey needs to be more enjoyable than ever.\n\"How we travel is changing. Today's tech-driven, fast-paced world means that we have to strive to be innovative, rethink what we've done historically, and offer more convenience and comfort to our guests,\" he says.", "external_links": ["http://www.skymall.com/", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150910191717-etihad-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150910191717-etihad-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150910191717-etihad-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150910191717-etihad-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150910191717-etihad-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150910191717-etihad-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150910191717-etihad-small-169.jpg", "http://onemileatatime.boardingarea.com/", "http://www.tengroup.com/"], "published": "2015-09-24T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:17:51.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
