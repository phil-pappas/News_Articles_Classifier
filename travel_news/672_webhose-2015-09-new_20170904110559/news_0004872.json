The mobile phone is related to this topic because is an instrument which makes the travel more personal and it’s used as a commercial vehicle operation. \nSmartphones are revolutionizing the travel industry thanks to geo-localization. Travel brands use this medium for direct sales, for building awareness and direct bookings via mobile are growing up and in a short period of time, they are going to become a main way of commerce and a compulsory choice for the enterprises: mobile social network application has surged 138 % in 2013 (Eye for travel, 2014). Smartphone penetration is expected to reach 96% in Europe by 2015 according to Ovum, with mobile phones set to overtake PCs as the most common web access device worldwide. The evolution of m-commerce is expected to be extremely fast, with high international roaming costs the major obstacle. Almost 60% of European travelers are forecast to use a smartphone to find travel information and/or make reservations by 2015, according to Euromonitor International (WTM, 2014). \n\nBusiness travelers were the first consumer group to adopt mobile travel technology due to the need to make last minute reservations. Leisure consumers are quickly catching up. Mobile applications offer various services from flight booking/check-in (BA), guidebooks (Lonely Planet), tourist information to building an itinerary (TripIt). GPS-based travel applications impact travel behavior, favoring last-minute bookings via smartphones at the tourism destination, leading to shorter booking windows. The opportunities from smartphones for travel operators and all tourism shareholders are huge. Although a presence on Google and other search engines will remain key issues, mobile travel applications are expected to gain ground thanks to their superior convenience, shaping in that way the future in travel. “ \n \n \nUdi Shapira \nFounder of Vidtur.com \n“ To sum up my thoughts regarding the effect of digital tourism on the future of travel I would say that in perfect world of Digital tourism people will no longer understand the term “tourist trap”. The travel industry has been in a constant change in the past few years when different services helped tourist to improve the way they plan, book and experience their vacation. But I don’t think that digital tourism is perfect. While booking your flights and hotel was brought almost into perfection, I believe that what is still missing for tourists are tools that will help them plan what to do in their vacation, or what not to do. \n \nWhen we started Vidtur, our purpose was to help people become better travelers. Digital tourism was lacking something almost every other industry already has – a rich library of professional and semiprofessional videos (especially in languages other than English). So while it is easy to book the most suitable hotel (checking UGC comments in various websites) and getting the best deal on flights (after scanning hundreds of offers in one click) we end up gathering textual and dry information in travel blogs, and ending in buying the traditional “travel guide” in the book shop. \nI believe that once we complete the next step in digital tourism, giving travelers new ways to learn more about their destination before they travel, a whole new sector in the travel industry will be reshaping – the tour and activity world. When travelers will have better digital tools to plan their vacation, they will do more, and see more, but they will also acquire the services online pre traveling, and they will also enjoy the power of UGC and social that will help travelers define the value of these tours and activities and will get rid one of the last tourist traps exist. “", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T18:34:50.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
