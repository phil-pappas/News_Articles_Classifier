Set an Example \nDo you have children? If so, you are setting a positive example for them. Even if you don't have children, your actions set an example for others. All the people in your life will see you taking action towards your goals. While anyone can pick up a motivational book for inspiring tips, they may not all see a person in their lives actually executing a path towards their dreams. Show them how it is done! Light the flame of encouragement for them. \n2. Lessons Learned from the entrepreneur journey \nNo course can replace the valuable learning experiences that come from a hands on approach to building your business. Education is extremely important. However, so is the execution process. \nMost of the lessons will vary per entrepreneur. But some lessons are universal. All entrepreneurs realize at some point (hopefully sooner than later) how time is one of their most valuable assets. \n3. To finally stop listening to self-doubt and naysayers \nYou have a vision in mind. Are you really going to let negative thoughts or other people stop you from daring to try? Why let all that nonsense get in the way for what you really want in this life? Take action now and triumph over any negative commentary. You might still be thinking, \"What if I fail?\" So? You took action towards your goals. That is something to be proud of. Reflect briefly and try again. \n4. To give life meaning \nSure you can spend the rest of your life working at a dead-end job you hate. But why? Life is too short. As clich√© as it sounds, it is 100% true. Find your true calling. Create your dream position. Be free. Become your own boss. Stop breaking your own back for others when you can pour all that time and energy investing in your own vision. Worried about money? Start off slowly building your business. Once you feel financially ready, then make the complete transition to full time entrepreneur. \n5. Superficial stuff does not provide lasting happiness \nIn your final moments, you won't think, \"I wish I watched more Netflix.\" Instead you will regret all the chances you didn't take. \nWhat is your dream business? Share below. Let it serve as a pledge that you will create a path toward your dream business. Studies show that if you tell others about your goals, you are more likely to complete them. Good luck on your journey! More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T00:13:41.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
