I, with my wife, just planned a trip to Meghalaya. we are reaching Shillong tomorrow that is on 23rd September. Our return journey is scheduled from Guwahati on 27th. As we have already booked Hotel Alpine Continental in Shillong for Four days, we are looking for a Shillong centric trip plan. We are completely flexible with itineraries. It can be made by anything like motorcycle or shared cab or tourist bus. Though I know it's a very short time to ask for suggestion, Can you suggest any idea for us?
