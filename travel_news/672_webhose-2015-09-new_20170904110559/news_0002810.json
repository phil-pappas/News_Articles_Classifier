Perhaps you don't have much time off from work. Or it's too expensive. Or you just don't want to fly overseas. We love visiting Paris and soaking up the culture, but when it's not convenient, there is another option.\nYou can experience an alternative version of France just a short hop from Philadelphia. The Canadian province of Quebec offers two Gallic-influenced cities that will scratch that French itch: Montreal and Québec City.\nWhen leisurely stopping for a flaky croissant at a sidewalk cafe on the cobblestoned Place Royale of Vieux-Quebec, the old city, it's hard to believe you're not in France. The menu is in French, the waiters speak French, and the singsong accents of those around you make you forget you never left North America. If you took French in high school, you can practice it there with a slightly easier-to-follow Canadian accent.\nAdding to the Old World flair, Québec City, with its stone ramparts, is North America's only remaining fortified city north of Mexico.\nMore coverage Personal Journey: München/Munich: a hometown, a destination How to find a Disney cruise for less Farther south, the cosmopolitan city of Montreal is an easy seven-hour drive from Philadelphia, making it about the same distance as a trip to the Outer Banks. Stop in at a Breton cafe for a crepe or perhaps a hearty cassoulet.\nBoth cities provide shopping that is très à la mode at affordable prices, due to the strong U.S. dollar. And because it's Canada, after all, English is widely spoken.\nTo plan your next-best-thing-to-France experience, go to www.quebecregion.com/en or www.tourisme-montreal.org .", "external_links": ["http://www.quebecregion.com/en"], "published": "2015-09-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T15:59:22.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
