Published on : Thursday, September 10, 2015\nLaunching in September 2015, Gaelic Girl Getaways is the first female-only cooking, baking and guided tour of Ireland.\nWith the success of the Gaelic Girl Goodies Brand (a range of traditional Irish bread mixes sold out of Ireland’s top tourist stores and airports), Gaelic Girl is now offering women the chance to join other ‘Gaelic Girls’ on a culinary delight tour of Ireland. ‘Castles and Cooking’ is the first GG Getaway to give both solo and group female travellers a truly unique tour of Ireland that includes traditional Irish bread and dish making, exploring Ireland’s castles (with a banquet meal) and fun filled trip to the best Irish spots.\n‘While Ireland has traditionally been a place to discover your ancestral roots and visit the ‘old sod’, in recent times we have seen a huge increase in the number of solo female travellers looking for food related tours’, explains Gaelic Girl founder, Sandra Sheerin.\n‘We decided to bring like-minded female travellers together on a trip that will give them an authentic taste of Ireland and a unique insight into the old world cuisine of Ireland, even if they can’t boil water in their own home’.\nGaelic Girl Getaways will run their first tour of 2016 on the week of St. Patrick’s Day bringing women around the west coast of Ireland to discover Irish bread-making skills and the origin of authentic Irish dishes hailing from the west coast of the island.\nEssentials for Gaelic Girl Getaways – Tastebuds (Guinness or Gourmet) and a wicked sense of humor.\nSource:- Tourism Ireland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T07:55:46.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
