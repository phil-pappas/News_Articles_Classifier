A first glimpse of the iconic destinations and new characters that will be featured throughout the new attraction this year was released today, offering a special look into SpongeBob's Christmas Party adventure.\nThis brand-new frosted wonderland will give guests an opportunity to experience Bikini Bottom's landmarks like never before -- kids and families can walk through a full-size Krusty Krab made entirely of ice; explore an all-ice Flying Dutchman pirate ship; dive into the eerie depths of Rock Bottom, and stroll on Conch Street, home to SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward. Guests will even be able to belly up to the bar of the Salty Spitoon watering hole from the beloved TV series. And last year's guest-favorite 100-foot ice slides will be back this year with an all-new sled race!\n\"This year is a whole new level of artistry and fun. It's SpongeBob's Christmas Party and this brand new theme will allow guests to explore places in Bikini Bottom that they have never experienced before,\" said John Zendt , Moody Gardens President and CEO, who added that the addition of new color techniques, more sculptures and scenes continue to push new boundaries of creativity for an even better guest experience. \"The holiday season is a wonderful time for families and this is the ideal venue for creating some very special memories.\"\nLast year saw record crowds with over 100,000 guests visiting ICE LAND in its first year. With the help of the continued partnerships with Nickelodeon and the VYA Ice Carving Team from Harbin, China , ICE LAND will feature over 2 million pounds of ice this year and even more sculptures. Chilled and held at a continuous temperature of nine degrees, guests can witness these towering works of art within a 28,000 sq. ft. insulated tent structure located on the property.\nAs the only holiday ice exhibition on the Gulf Coast, this holiday treat for the whole family will be open through January 10 as Galveston makes its holiday transition into a Winter Wonder Island . Admission to the exhibit is $26.95 for adults, $21.95 for seniors and $15.95 for children. A Value Days discount of $5.00 is available Sunday through Thursday November 15 – December 17 , excluding Thanksgiving Day .
