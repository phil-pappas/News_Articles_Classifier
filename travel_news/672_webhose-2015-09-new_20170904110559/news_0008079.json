The studio of painter Vicko Buktenica, a man obsessed by local rural landscapes and donkeys, is also worth a visit.\nSolta's only hotel is the luxury Martinis Marchi, set in a seaside 18th-century castle, but inexpensive B&Bs and apartments are available.\nGetting there: Take a 25-minute catamaran or 45-minute car ferry from Split, Dalmatia's biggest city.\nAzores (Portugal)\nThis group of nine islands in the Atlantic Ocean, 1,287 kilometers (800 miles) west of mainland Portugal, features volcanoes, blue hydrangeas, steep seaside cliffs and more shades of blue and green than a paint shop's color palette.\nTurquoise-blue and emerald-green crater lakes lie side-by-side on Sao Miguel island at Lagoa das Sete Cidades.\nPico island is where Portugal's highest mountain can be found. At 7,700 feet tall (2,346 meters), Mount Pico is often shrouded in clouds.\nIn Faial, Horta's marina is adorned with art created by sailors from all over the world.\nFlores is filled with colorful flowers -- hence its name -- mountains, crater lakes and waterfalls.\nGetting there: Take a four-hour flight from Boston, Massachusetts on Azores Express, or a two-hour flight from Lisbon, to Ponta Delgada on Sao Miguel island. Inter-island flights and ferries are available.\nLummi Island (Washington state)\nOn this quiet, evergreen-covered island, 2015 James Beard Best Chef Northwest award-winner Blaine Wetzel of The Willows Inn presides over a parade of exquisite bites, all fished, farmed and foraged on the island of Lummi.\nPraised as one of 10 restaurants worldwide \"worth a plane ride\" by New York Times in 2011, his restaurant is in Lummi's only hotel.\nEven cocktails are island-sourced: A top choice is the Spotted Owl, made from Douglas fir nettles, gin and citrus.\nThere's a thriving artist community -- open studio tours showcase more than 40 artists and craftsmen three times a year.\nEnergy healing sessions can be found at Tree Frog Farm, which makes flower essences and aromatherapy products.\nGetting there: Take a 5-minute ride on the Whatcom Chief car ferry, which leaves hourly from Gooseberry Point, near Bellingham, a city 48 kilometers (30 miles) south of Vancouver and 145 kilometers (90 miles) north of Seattle.\nSark (Channel Islands, UK)\nDubbed the world's first \"dark-sky island\" by the International Dark Sky Association, the most rural of the five Channel Islands offers a terrific view of the Milky Way given it has no street lights or automobiles.\nCars, buses and motorcycles are banned on this island of about 600 people about 128 kilometers (80 miles) south of England, meaning visitors get to experience both pure air and quiet.\nHorse-drawn carriages, bicycles and farm tractors add to the enchanting time warp.\nSark scenery includes wildflower-filled meadows, a dramatic craggy coastline and the narrow natural causeway connecting Sark to Little Sark.\nSark has only two hotels: La Sablonnerie, with an acclaimed restaurant serving local lobster and fish and its own farm, and Stocks Hotel, a former 16th-century farm in a wooded valley. There are a few B&Bs as well.\nGetting there: One-hour ferries depart from Guernsey (a Channel Island) several times a day during peak season, daily in winter.

Its biggest town, Longyearbyen, has about 2,000 people.\nWildflowers blossom in summer thanks to surprisingly warm temperatures (9 degrees Celsius), while the midnight sun offers continuous daylight from mid-April to late August.\nVisitors can watch for the Northern Lights during mid-November to February, when darkness reigns.\nDog sledging in a wagon pulled by huskies, hiking and sea kayaking are popular summer activities.
