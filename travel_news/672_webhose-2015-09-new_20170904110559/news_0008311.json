Salim Matramkot DOHA: Unique shows being staged in malls participating in Eid Al Adha Festival organised by Qatar Tourism Authority (QTA) and its partners have proved a huge draw among visitors of all ages. \n\nThousands come to watch the shows some of which being staged for the first time. \n\nEven one hour before the show yesterday families were seen queuing outside City Centre Doha’s skating rink where the ‘Aladdin’ show is being performed daily during the holidays. \n\nThe mall has beefed up security and safety with every audience member having to pass through a scanner to enter the venue. “I have been fascinated with the classic tale of Aladdin since I was a child and I want my children to experience the same wonder” said Dana Naser who came to the show with her family. \n\nThe rink was filled with crowds while still many got a good view of the spectacle standing by the railings of all four floors of the mall. \n\nThe show is unique as it combines modern songs and dances dashed with acrobatic elements to tell the timeless tale of one of the popular characters from the Arabian Nights anthology. \n\nYoung fans were given chance to have their photos taken along with the cast during a meet and greet immediately after the show. \n\nVisitors also enjoyed roaming shows such as the traditional Ardha dance Mr Dropsy and the Bellboy and circus parade. \n\nHyatt Plaza Mall’s Play-Doh show at Food Court also saw big turnout of children who enjoyed the adorable Doh-Doh characters. The show is interactive and inclusive and young children danced and sang along with the four playful characters. \n\nOther malls staging shows for the family include Dar Al Salam with Bob the Builder Ezdan Mall (Dora the Explorer) Lagoona Mall (Cinderella) and Al Khor Mall (Kid’s Circus). \n\nApart from increasing the footfall in the malls the shows have also helped drive sales according to some retail shops and restaurants. Other roaming shows in the malls include Arabs Got Talent sensation ‘Snoopy’ ‘Jig & Saw’ Balloonatics and ‘Frozen Tribute’ also a crowd-puller because of royal sisters Anna and Elsa from the highest grossing animated movie of all time.
