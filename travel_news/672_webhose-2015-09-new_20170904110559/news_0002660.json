An overview in numbers.\nSix months after the official unveiling, Brussels Airlines’ Tintin aircraft can look back on great adventures. Rackham has welcomed over 85,000 travellers and has flown 2.5 times the distance to the moon on his trips to over 40 different countries. Rackham is the favorite subject of many plane spotters and is wildly popular on Instagram, including among Brussels Airlines’ own flight crew.\nNew pictures of the shark shaped plane appear on Instagram and Twitter every day. A project coordinated closely between the cartoonists of Moulinsart and Brussels Airlines, Rackham was created by the airline to translate the company’s values and to help accomplish their mission statement, which is to make travel a pleasure again.\nSource:- Brussels Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T18:13:37.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
