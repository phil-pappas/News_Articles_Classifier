Nevertheless excellent examples can be found from Cornwall to Yorkshire. These fun-packed, easy-going addresses have plenty of facilities, whether courses and special events, swimming pools, sailing, beachcombing, horse-riding, playgrounds, crèches or activity-packed clubs, to keep even the most restless children occupied and give the most harassed parents time to themselves in the evening thanks to special suppers and babysitters. Any hotel that manages to satisfy both the grown ups and the kids in equal measure, is a hotel worthy of its ‘family-friendly’ cachet. Bedruthan Steps, Cornwall \nBedruthan have been looking after families for more than 60 years (their sister hotel, the Scarlet , down the hill at Mawgan Porth, is for adults only) and strikes an excellent balance between child-friendliness and adult entertainment. Children are superbly catered for: from baby exploring play areas, baby backpacks and babysitting to an outdoor wooden ship and Wild Café for children’s meals, plus two hours’ free childcare per day and the Z-Club for over eights, as well as an activities programme at busy times. \nRead more: the best hotels in Cornwall The Elms, Worcestershire \nPart of the collection of Luxury Family Hotels ( Fowey Hall , Woolley Grange and Moonfleet Manor also stand out), The Elms introduces a lesser known, but no less beautiful part of the country to family holidaymakers, within easy reach of the Midlands, Cotswolds, Welsh Borders and West Midlands Safari Park.

Set amid 500 acres of luscious green fields, guests can watch the hotel’s horses frolick in paddocks from the sophisticated bedrooms of the 18th-century renovated manor with spoiling spa, while children can be happily entertained in the pool, at the Kids’ Club, cycling, playing croquet or tennis or even \"owning a pony\" for a day or boating on the Basingstoke Canal. \nRead more: the best hotels in Hampshire Augill Castle, Cumbria \nQuirky and delightful, Augill Castle is a Victorian gentleman’s folly in the lovely Eden Valley between the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales. With the trappings of a neo-Gothic castle – tower, turrets, castellations and mullions – but in miniature, it appeals equally to children as to adults, and you’d be hard pressed to find a family-friendlier castle, with a tree house, playground and tennis court in its 15-acre grounds, and inside, a 12-seater cinema, not to mention the popular children’s cookery school. \nRead more: the best hotels in the Lake District Chewton Glen, Hampshire \nThe original eight-bedroom house has expanded to 58, plus a lavish spa, indoor and outdoor pools, tennis centre and nine-hole golf course.

Bedrooms and suites, in many different styles, still display their customary attention to detail, down to the stamped postcards on each desk, but are less fussy than they were. \nRead more: the best hotels in Hampshire Babington House, Somerset \nA fine Georgian country house, with a chapel, a spa, a kids' club, bedrooms in the house and in outbuildings and a lovely Orangery for dining.

There is also, however, a beautiful Georgian drawing room. The 31 rooms are traditional in style and range from huge suites to cosy doubles. Cheapest are the four ‘Knights’ rooms, of which Ripon is the best as it has a wonderful view.

The rooms and suites, many connecting, have class and style, and there are plenty of imaginative and luxurious extra touches. Every child that stays will find new toys and books in their room, plus personalised presents, fun duvet covers, mini bathrobes and slippers, and gingerbread men with their names iced on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T19:14:15.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
