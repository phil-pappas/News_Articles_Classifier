It will see VietJet become Vietnam's first private carrier to link with Myanmar's commercial capital. \nThe new service will link the two cities on a Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. VietJet vice president Nguyen Thi Thuy Binh was quoted in local media as saying the expansion was to connect the two countries' business, culture and tourism. \nOn 1 November the airline will also introduce a daily service between Hanoi and Yangon. \nState-owned Vietnam Airlines also offers flights between Hanoi and Yangon and Ho Chi Minh City and Yangon. \nAs a low-cost carrier, VietJet's network sees it fly over 30 routes within Vietnam and to regional points including Bangkok, Seoul and Singapore. \nAs Myanmar continues to open up to the world, the destination is experiencing a surge in international tourism. In 2014 it welcomed over 3 million visitors for the first time, following a record 2 million plus arrivals in 2013. The hotel and tourism ministry is aiming for over 5 million arrivals in 2015. \nYangon, the largest city and primary international gateway to Myanmar, is served by regional air links from cities like Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Singapore and Hong Kong. \nNaturally, a large percentage of visitors to Myanmar include a stay in Yangon in their travel plans. The city offers intriguing historical sights and a busy pace of life, and the accommodation sector includes some of the finest historic hotels in Southeast Asia. One of the most iconic five star hotels in Yangon is The Strand Yangon which was built in 1901 by the founders of Singapore's Raffles Hotel, Sarkies Brothers. \nAlongside these and other luxury hotels in Yangon, there's also a choice of budget, three and four star properties including brand names like Best Western, Novotel and Shangri-La. \nAdding more choice in air links for those planning a stay in Yangon and other fascinating destinations in Myanmar, national flag carrier Myanmar National Airlines launched a new Yangon-Singapore daily (except Saturday) service in mid August using a newly delivered B737-800 aircraft, the first of 10 aircraft it has ordered in a multi-million dollar deal. \nMyanmar National Airlines plans to expand its international network to four more cities in the Asia Pacific region by early 2016 and will roll out its new brand across the fleet. \nThe ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) Open Skies policy came into effect on 1 January 2015. Also known as the ASEAN Single Aviation Market (ASEAN-SAM), the Open Skies policy is intended to increase regional and domestic connectivity, integrate production networks and enhance regional trade by allowing airlines from ASEAN member states to fly freely throughout the region via the liberalization of air services under a single, unified air transport market. \nAirline industry analysts are generally positive about the new policy, saying it will lead to growth and development as it opens up the market to more competition. \nThe Single Aviation Market comes ahead of the planned introduction of a free-trade era known as the ASEAN Economic Community, which is due to come into play at the end of 2015. \"The Strand Yangon (www.hotelthestrand.com) is one of Southeast Asia's grand colonial hotels and still one of its most awe inspiring.
