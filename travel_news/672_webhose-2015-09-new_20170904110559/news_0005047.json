Weary railroad workers and passengers followed at the turn of the century, and then came the flood of travelers along historic Route 66.\nThe artesian spring, tucked into a rock outcropping just off the highway, pumps out some 3,000 gallons of water per minute. The pool’s crystal-clear conditions have attracted divers from around the world.\nThen there’s the consistently cool temperature and the depth.\nThe bell-shaped spring gets wider as it gets deeper. About 80 feet down, a metal grate keeps divers from going any farther into the maze of caves that sits below it.\nThe cave system has been sealed off since 1976, when two divers in training died after getting separated from their classmates. New Mexico State Police divers quickly found one of the bodies; it took several weeks to find the other. In the process, police divers were able to make a crude map of some of the unexplored passageways.\nAt the time, one of the divers descended nearly 200 feet and found himself at the edge of an underwater cliff. His powerful flashlight wasn’t enough to illuminate the cave wall across from him, or the bottom.\nIn 2013, divers with the ADM Exploration Foundation attempted an expedition. They had little success getting past the tons of rock the city had dumped onto the grate to keep people out.\nToday, tourism officials are highlighting Blue Hole as part of the New Mexico True campaign. One of the campaign’s videos features young, fit hipsters in trunks and bikinis dancing and diving in slow motion into the Blue Hole. It’s really a scene from any given summer day, with the bravest of the bunch taking a leap from the natural diving boards that surround the sinkhole.\nNot up for a thrill? Use the concrete steps to reach the water.\nDivers from around the region flock to Blue Hole for fun and certification, as it’s one of the best diving spots in the Southwest.\nThe Associated Press\nWhen you go Santa Rosa Blue Hole is at 1085 Blue Hole Road, Santa Rosa, N.M. santarosabluehole.com .
