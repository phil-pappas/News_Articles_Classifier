He’s run through camp the whole time. He’s been getting work by our trainer prior to when he came back to practice and he’s been running like crazy. He looks fast as ever. He looks great. So I don’t see any indication that he’s not ready.”\nThomas has not taken a hit on his shoulder and that will obviously bear some watching.\nBut Thomas appears ready to take that next step into the regular season.\nThomas has never missed a game since being drafted by the Seahawks in the first round in 2010, starting all 80 regular season games and eight in the playoffs.\nBob Condotta : 206-515-5699 or bcondotta@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @bobcondotta .
