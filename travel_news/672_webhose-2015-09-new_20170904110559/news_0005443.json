Thome | Sep 23, 2015 eTN   \nMr. Freddy Karkaria has unexpectedly stepped down from his position as Chairman of the Seychelles Hospitality and Tourism Association during a board meeting held two days ago. \nThe board members present immediately appointed Mrs. Sybille Cardon as interim Chair to serve out the current term of office which officially expires in June 2016. \nMr. Karkaria reportedly made the following statement at the board meeting: \"It has been my privilege and honor to serve. Whilst I remain keen and willing to continue to support and assist the SHTA and the tourism trade in general in reaching the goals and objectives set, circumstances in the business I work in now make it inappropriate for me to retain the mantle of Chairperson. I have no doubt that Sybille Cardon has the knowledge, capacity and strength of character to continue to forge ahead and build further on the synergies that exist among our colleagues and friends on the Board, and with whom it has been my distinct pleasure to collaborate and work as a team\". \nMrs. Sybille Cardon, who owns the Les Lauriers Eco Hotel & Restaurant on Praslin, in response to her appointment then commented: \"I sincerely thank Freddy for all he has done during his tenure as Chairperson. I am very much looking forward to working closely with the Board to continue, consolidate and extend the many positive initiatives begun by Freddy Karkaria. I am convinced that our Association has a great deal to contribute through the expertise of its members. We have the capacity to work together with all industry stakeholders for the benefit of our country, Seychelles, and I pledge to do my utmost to make my tenure as Chairperson a productive and effective one\". \nMembers of the Board of SHTA also expressed their gratitude to Mr. Karkaria while still coming to terms with his decision to step down from the top seat of the Seychelles tourism private sector. The SHTA board then moved on to call on members to continue their support for the organization while assuring them that the organization will continue to serve the interests of all members and stakeholders in their engagement with government.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T15:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T19:47:19.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
