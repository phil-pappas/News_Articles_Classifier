It will take a coordinated effort of industry, NGOs and government to solve this growing economic and environmental problem.\" \nEight million metric tonnes of plastic leak into the world's ocean every year and the amounts continue to grow. Without concerted global action, there could be one ton of plastic for every 3 tons of fish by 2025, leading to massive environmental, economic and health issues. With at least 80 percent of ocean plastic originating from land-based sources, the report's findings propose a four-point solution to cutting leakage by 45 percent in the next 10 years, dramatically reducing ocean plastic waste by 2025 with the ultimate goal of eradicating the issue by 2035. The report estimates that total costs for implementing these solutions could be contained at $5 billion a year, with significant returns to the global economy. \n\"Considering this is a global environmental challenge impacting sanitation and health, land values, important sources of global protein, and the growth of the consumer goods and packaging industries, an estimated $5 billion scale of intervention makes this one of the most solvable of the environmental challenges we collectively face,\" said Dr. Martin Stuchtey, director of the McKinsey Center for Business and Environment. \nStemming the Tide specifically underscores the important role of industry in driving the solutions and catalyzing public and private investment to solve the problem of ocean plastic leakage \n\"We're committed to working toward a future of a plastic-free ocean,\" said Jeff Wooster, global sustainability director, Dow Packaging and Specialty Plastics, a partner on the report. \"Companies don't make plastic with the intent of it ending up in the ocean, and we acknowledge the strong role industry must play in order to help eliminate ocean plastic waste by 2035.\" \nIn the short and medium term, the report calls for accelerated development of waste collection and plugging of post-collection leakage, followed by the development and rollout of commercially viable treatment options. In the long term, the report identifies the critical need for innovations in recovery and treatment technologies, development of new materials and product designs that better facilitate reuse or recycling. \nThe report further emphasizes the need for all approaches and solutions to be tailored at the regional level, specifically in the five priority countries identified, which account for half of all plastic leakage globally. While countries have made major improvements in curbing plastic leakage, greater global support is needed to scale impact swiftly in these priority regions. \n\"The issue of plastic waste in our oceans is having drastic consequences on the livelihoods and health of the people of Dagupan,\" said Belen Fernandez, Mayor of the city of Dagupan, a coastal community in the Philippines. \"Our town has had a dump site on our beach for over 50 years. We're working hard to close the dump, and increase the capacity of waste management in Dagupan. Addressing the problem of ocean plastic will have real benefits for not just the environment, but for our citizens - by improving their quality of life. I hope our city and our work will become a model for what's possible around the world.\" \nThe report underscores that the next 10 years will be critical to effectively solve the problem of ocean plastic– a problem that is not just local, but global in nature. To achieve success, the report calls for a concerted global response driven by an international coalition of companies, governments and NGOs that will catalyze commitments from political leadership, provide local \"proofs of concept,\" provide waste management technology support and prioritize the ocean plastic waste issue as part of the global policy agenda on the ocean and the environment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T16:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T21:51:03.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
