The repayments will be refunded automatically to drivers’ bank accounts over the next few days. Disciplinary action is in progress in relation to the relevant employees and therefore our solicitors inform us that we are unable to comment further in that regard.\nWe have never before had a problem of this nature, which runs contrary to the normally high standards of our business and the rigorous training of all our staff. We have taken steps to ensure that no further incidents of this nature can occur in the future.\n– UK Parking Control LTD Simone Riley-Young, who was one of those affected, was issued with a £100 ticket wrongly issued after the timestamp on her ticket was altered. She was issued the fine after the company claimed she had arrived in the car park earlier than she had, and returned after a two hour period had elapsed.\nI met a friend in the car park, got here at 8:20am returned to our cars at 10am and I had a fine on my windscreen and when I looked into it a bit closer it said I'd been here since 7:15 when my car was allegedly first seen, but I was actually still in bed with my alarm going off at that time.\n– Simone Riley-Young Simone Riley-Young with the ticket wrongly issued to her by UK Parking Control Credit: ITV News The British Parking Association says it is investigating UKPC which issued these charges but says it can not comment on individual cases. They also said it will not tolerate evidence tampering and that all parking management needs to be fair, reasonable and robust.\nIf breaches of the code of practice have occurred it can issue sanctions and if there are multiple breaches it can remove members from the association.\nLast updated Fri 11 Sep 2015 Travel Lincoln Lincolnshire", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T05:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T15:27:05.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
