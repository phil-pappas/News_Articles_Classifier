A few seconds later, she added, \"Mommy, I'm scared.\"\nThe mother fainted when she got her daughter's texts, family attorney Brett Beatty has said.\nChaudhry, 57, was in the U.S. to visit acquaintances in Oklahoma. He pleaded not guilty to two counts of abusive sexual contact with a child between 12 and 16. Each count carries a maximum two-year prison sentence.\nThe doctor is free on $100,000 bail. Among the conditions of his release is that he cannot fly, so he drove the 16 hours from Oklahoma to Chicago for Tuesday's arraignment.\nThe arraignment comes days after the girl's parents filed a federal lawsuit in Des Moines, suing Chaudhry and American Airlines. Beatty said the airline should have done more to protect the girl, including putting her in a seat where she could be easily monitored.\nAmerican spokesman Josh Freed said in a statement last week that the airline \"cares deeply about our young passengers and is committed to providing a safe travel experience for them.\"\nAccording to the complaint, the girl had been seated next to a window with no one in the two seats to her left, when Chaudhry moved up a row and sat in one of those seats. At one point, the girl fell asleep with her legs on a seat between them, then awoke to feel Chaudhry legs intertwined with hers under a blanket.\nWhen Chaudhry got up to use the restroom, the girl complained to a flight attendant, who moved her to the first-class section. Authorities detained Chaudhry when the plane touched down in Chicago.\nNeither Chaudhry nor his attorney spoke to reporters after Tuesday's arraignment.\nChaudhry told agents that he moved up to the girl's row to give passengers in his section more room, according to the complaint. He said he may have inadvertently touched the girl's arm when he asked her to close the window shade.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T11:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T01:28:08.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
