Located three miles above the Pacific Ocean, the program combines four to five hours of group mountain hiking and afternoons filled with exercise classes and private massages daily. The Ranch also offers impressive amenities including luxurious private accommodations, an on-site organic garden, exercise pavilion and outdoor pool. In 2013 the program expanded to include The Ranch 4.0, a four-day abbreviated version of the acclaimed seven-day program. The Ranch 4.0 is designed for those looking to jump-start a healthier lifestyle but are unable to be away from home or work for a full week, and desire to maintain more connectivity during their program. In just five years since launch programs have developed a cult-like following with a 35% return rate, guests opting for single and multi-week stays, group and incentive travel buyouts and recognition at the top of domestic and international travel awards lists including Travel + Leisure Tatler, Spa Finder, Organic Spa and Lonely Planet.\nMedia Contacts:\nFor Exclusive Resorts\nNike Communications\nKatie Archambault\nkarchambault@nikecomm.com\n646.654.3421\nFor The Ranch at Live Oak\nMagrino\nBailey Horn\nbailey.horn@smapr.com\n212.584.6453\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150913/265971\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150225/177964LOGO\n releases/exclusive-resorts-launches-strategic-partnership-with-the-ranch-at-live-oak-malibu-300141978.html\n ", "external_links": ["https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150913/265971", "http://newsroom.exclusiveresorts.com/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150225/177964LOGO", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150913/265971", "http://www.facebook.com/pages/Exclusive-Resorts/240282700617?ref=ts", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/exclusive-resorts-launches-strategic-partnership-with-the-ranch-at-live-oak-malibu-300141978.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LA00304&Transmission_Id=201509160800PR_NEWS_USPR_____LA00304&DateId=20150916", "https://twitter.com/exclusiveresrts", "http://www.exclusiveresorts.com/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150225/177964LOGO", "http://www.theranchmalibu.com/"], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T17:44:57.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
