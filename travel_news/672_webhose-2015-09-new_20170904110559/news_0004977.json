Keep these brief tips in mind and you will enjoy the search much more. \nWhen faced with the vast amount of decisions you need to make when planning a trip to London and, in particular, the ever-popular area of Kensington, hotels might seem like one of the easiest parts to sort out. Unfortunately, because of the borough’s popularity with both tourists and businesspeople on work-related trips, trying to cherry-pick which Kensington hotels would suit you best can become a bit of a headache. Here are some great tips that will help you book the perfect accommodation. \nMake a List of Must-haves \nWhen searching online for a hotel, it is very easy to get lost in the sheer number of places available. That is why, before you even type ‘Kensington hotels’ into your search bar, you should have a clear idea of what your hotel of choice absolutely must have, and what you can make do without. \nWhether you cannot conceive of a week without Wi-Fi or without a hairdryer is up to you, but keep these essentials in mind when sorting through options. Many booking websites will have filters for amenities available, so choose the ones that are most important to you (and your family) and stick to them. Remember: it is better to widen your search location-wise than to be reminded every morning that, annoyingly (and expensively), breakfast is not included. \nStudy a Map of the Area \nMaybe being close to public transport is non-negotiable because you have small children who cannot yet walk long distances; or maybe it is important to have plenty of restaurants on your doorstep so you can avoid the headache of figure out London’s streets in the dark of night. If you've decided you want to stay in Kensington, hotels can be found on practically every corner, so use a virtual map that indicates where you can find accommodation, and only select those that fulfil your location-related requirements. \nCheck if Children Are Welcome \nWhether you are travelling with children or you want to steer clear of anyone underage, it is highly recommended that you double- and triple-check if the hotels you have short-listed are welcoming of little ones. For example, if you're bringing your infant along for their first holiday, ensure the hotel can provide you with a crib if you need one and that it has a refrigerator in the room for bottles etc. \nRead a Few Reviews for Peace of Mind \nBecause so many visitors to London love staying in Kensington, there are always plenty of reviews you can read online. Keep an open mind and remember that, at the end of the day, you probably know what suits you best. Don’t be scared to demand a perfect fit: Kensington is sure to have it.   \nMatthew Zelinski works for the London Regency Hotel, one of the top Kensington hotels .
