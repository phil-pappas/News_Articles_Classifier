Then, as you drive down the long entrance into the heart of the nearly 300-acre sanctuary that is Lands in Love Hotel and Resort (Tierras Enamoradas), you’re overwhelmed by the lush, tropical scenery of the valley and the aromas wafting from the resort’s kitchen.\nThe hunger-inducing scents arrive courtesy of Naama Ariel, the resort’s head chef, and her staff. “I love serving healthy, delicious food to our guests — especially when they are meat eaters and they eat something here that they like so much, they say they want to come back,” said Ariel, who offers cooking classes to guests. “I like showing people that they don’t have to eat meat to have a tasty and satisfying meal.”\nContinue reading below\nMy favorite items off the menu included the lafa wrap, a grilled tortilla filled with tahini, Israeli vegetable salad, eggplant, and seasoned soy, and the vegan pad Thai. The breakfast buffet, which was included in the price of our room, was tasty and filling — so much so that we skipped lunch several days.\nGuests can hike the property’s many nature trails past waterfalls and lakes, go horseback riding, relax by the pool and Jacuzzi, or go zip-lining high above the cloud forest. What’s more, the facility serves as a rescue center that is home to more than 200 animals, many of which are strays or have been dropped off by owners who — often for financial reasons — can’t care for them any longer.\nFounded 10 years ago by a group of 19 friends from Israel who were looking for a place to live in peace while leading healthy, vegan lifestyles and caring for hundreds of animals (including the 80 cats and dogs they brought with them to Costa Rica), Lands in Love has evolved into a 33-room retreat where guests are encouraged to participate in the animals’ care, whether it be taking them for walks or simply spending time with them at the “pet hotel.” The resort’s recently revamped open-air lobby is filled with comfortable couches and chairs where guests gather to chat, read, or play one of the many board games available. Music is often playing, but when it’s not, the sound of birds provides a soothing backdrop.\nThe eco resort is located in San Lorenzo, about 60 miles from San Jose International Airport, easy to get to from Boston with a quick stop in Panama. We flew on Copa Airlines, pleased with the service, on-time performance, and overall experience.\nWhile Lands in Love offers plenty of activities, its staff also arranges outings, including to a nearby river for white-water rafting, to beaches, to ecological reserves, and to Arenal Volcano, about a 45-minute drive from the resort.\nAll profits from Lands in Love go toward the resort and paying for animal care, including an animal hospital planned for the property and the on-site veterinarian.\nHOTEL LANDS IN LOVE Route 702, road San Ramón to La Fortuna, Costa Rica. 408-215-1000. www.landsinlove.com .
