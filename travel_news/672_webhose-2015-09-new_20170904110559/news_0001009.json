In this ancient Chinese town, intricately decorated wooden houses lining both sides of a canal are roofed with black tiles that ooze an awesome feel. Sculling boats barge quietly along the waterway, passing beneath an arched bridge. The boats were loaded with swordsman, none of them seemed to be aware of the fact that they were being secretly followed by someone with the ability to move like the wind from one dark roof to another. \nThe ancient water town of Wuzhen glows at night. \nOK, the swordsmen and the mysterious warrior were all in my imagination. I watched too many Chinese TV series of martial arts heroes from Hong Kong when I was young. But the rest was real. This isn't a movie studio but a genuine, centuries-old Chinese settlement. So please pardon me for getting so carried away. \nI was in Wuzhen, formerly one of the most bustling water-based trade centres south of the lower reach of the Yangtze River, dating back long before the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD). During this time it was said the town was already home to 10,000 families, not to mention visiting merchants from other parts of the empire. Nowadays, Wuzhen is a town in China's eastern province of Zhejiang. \nTourists taking a break by dipping their feet in the canal is a common sight in the water town. Try it yourself and you’ll understand why they think it’s a good idea. \nRemnants of the original water town remain in two nearby areas. Both have been renovated and developed into \"scenic zones\". The West Scenic Zone covers areas along Xishi river which connects with the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal at its west end. The East Scenic Zone, located a little further east as its name suggests, sits along the banks of Dongshi river. After four full years of restoration and the overhauling of public facilities, the west zone was open to the public in 2007, six years after the smaller east zone made its debut as a tourist destination. \nWith only a day-and-a-half and one night to spend in Wuzhen, I only visited the west zone. The old town is sealed off from surrounding areas. All visitors must enter through one entrance from where they are then transported on electric passenger vehicles to a narrow street where they can start their own walking tour or take a boat ride along the canal behind the rows of buildings. \nNot every tourist knows that underneath the stone paved alleys of the restored ancient town, they are walking on all kinds of pipelines and cables. There are of course several hot spots for free public Wi-Fi. \nAn effective rubbish collection system keeps the entire area clean and tidy. Every morning rubbish collectors arrive by boat and the residents bring to them the bins, each one numbered so that the collectors can monitor which households follow the garbage separation rule and which do not. During the day, workers, many of them elderly, keep the streets and other public areas clean. Smoking is allowed only in designated spots. Of course, without co-operation from the residents and visitors, the majority of them Chinese, all these measures would not be so impressively effective. \nLike many tourist sites in China, Wuzhen can be crowded during the day. Luckily, I got to spend a night there so I could enjoy the charming town when there were not so many other tourists. By now the sky above the old town was pitch black. But in the canal, which glitters with reflected lights from the tastefully lit up homes along the waterside, sculling tour boats continue to pass by, although not as many as in the daytime. And no, none of them carried swordsmen. \nWith a focus on developing tourism, old waterways have come back to life. \nMuseums enrich your knowledge and experience. In Wuzhen you can find two. The Wedding Museum features the various details of related Chinese tradition, from the ceremony to the bedroom and even the bride’s underwear collection. It also has wedding costumes you can rent for taking photos. At the Footbinding Culture Museum, you will learn about the painful fate of Chinese women in the past who were forced to have their feet deformed from a young age in the name of beauty. \nCenturies ago merchants arrived in Wuzhen by boat. These days the water town is no longer a trading hub but sculling vessels continue to be a popular mode of transportation for visitors. However, the best way to explore every corner of the old town is on foot. And that can be done easily, thanks to Wuzhen’s simple layout and the use of illustrated maps. \nIn China there are many places that are famous for high quality silk. Wuzhen is one of them. At the Yida silk workshop, established in 1875 during the Qing Dynasty, you can see the entire process of creating silk brocades, from sericulture and reeling of silk threads to weaving using huge, complex looms, each requiring two people to operate. The workshop also produces blankets made of thick layers of silk as well as several other products. \nIn China there are many places that are famous for high quality silk. Wuzhen is one of them.

The old town boasts over a dozen restaurants of various styles, not to mention guest houses where home-cooked meals are offered and snack shops, one of which uses electric irons as a supplementary heat source. Among the recommended dishes to try are lamb noodles, marinated duck and stinky tofu. \nWith the revival of the ancient town, numerous arts and crafts that used to flourish in the former business hub were also brought back to life. Therefore there is much opportunity to shop here. Among Wuzhen’s best known souvenirs are embroidery, indigo printed fabrics, handpainted umbrellas, rice wine, chrysanthemum tea and soy sauce. Travel info \n- To get to Wuzhen, you have to first fly to nearby cities with international airports such as Hangzhou (Zhejiang's capital), Shanghai, Suzhou or Nanjing (the last two are in the adjacent Jiangsu province). I went to Wuzhen after a visit to Nanjing, the country's former capital which is connected to Bangkok by budget airline NokScoot (www.nokscoot.com).From those major cities, express buses to Wuzhen are available. Other options are to take a normal bus or train to Tongxiang or Jiaxing, the two nearest local transportation hubs where you can connect to Wuzhen. \n- You don't experience the real charm of the ancient town unless you stay overnight there. A variety of tourist accommodation is available, from hotels and a resort to a youth hostel and guest houses. \n- For more information, visit www.wuzhen.com.cn.
