She believes none of it would have happened if she wasn’t black.\nMs Brock was pulled over by police in Harlem when she stopped at a red light with the windows down and music blaring. Police asked why her hands weren’t on the wheel and she replied: “I was dancing, I am at a light,” she recounted to PIX11 in her first TV interview.\nThey then asked her to get out of the car and for reasons that remain unclear to Ms Brock, she was taken into custody and her car was impounded.\nShe spent four hours being held at the station before being released without charge.\nThe following day she returned to collect her car, a 2003 BMW 325Ci, but was denied by officers who, she says, didn’t believe the car was hers.\n“They put me in handcuffs and said they just need to put me in handcuffs to take me to my car. And I said OK, whatever it’s gonna take to get to my car,” she told the Huffington Post .\nBut she was then led to an ambulance and sedated before being taken to hospital.\n“He held on to me and then a doctor stuck me in the arm, and then I was on a stretcher. Then I just woke up to them taking my clothes off,” she said in the TV interview as she struggled to hold back tears.\n“I felt like I was in a nightmare.”\nThe Police got some effen nerve to say i spoke incoherently & inconsistently. My train of thought is always on track!!! #TheOne\n— Killa THEONE (@AkilahBrock) September 12, 2015 @AkilahBrock Soooo furious over what happened to you! Continue fighting!\n— Lisa A Godley (@lisaglove) September 12, 2015 Ms Brock spent eight hellish days in the mental health institute at the Harlem hospital where according to medical records obtained by her lawyer, Michael Lamonsoff, she was forced to take lithium and injected with powerful sedatives.\nThe records also reveal the city’s basis for detaining her and later labelling her with a diagnosis of delusion and bipolar disorder. The sole basis for her being held at the psychiatric ward was her claim that she owned the BMW, the assertion she was a banker and the fact that President Obama followed her on Twitter.\nThroughout her stay, personnel at the hospital repeatedly tried to encourage Ms Brock to deny all three before they would release her.\nBut it turned out all three claims were true.\nShe of course owned the car, she was working as a banker and had previously worked for Citibank, Chase and Astoria Bank and (along with 640,00 others) Obama did in fact follow her on Twitter.\nUpon her release, she was slapped with a $19,000 bill.\nThe incident happened on September 12, 2014 and was widely reported on earlier in the year. But her lawsuit and the subsequent proceedings have brought the ordeal back into the spotlight as she seeks compensation for the catastrophic actions of the authorities.\nThe city of New York has remained relatively quiet about the lawsuit but said in July Ms Brock was “acting irrational, she spoke incoherently and inconsistently, and she ran into the middle of traffic,” when police pulled her over.\nTaken from Ms Brock’s Instagram account, she is clearly proud of her wheels.
