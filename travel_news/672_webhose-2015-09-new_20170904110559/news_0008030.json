Aloft NYC Manhattan Downtown hotel opens Introduction Virgin Australia’s all-new A330 business class goes head-to-head against the Qantas Business Suite in the airlines' continued dogfight for premium passengers on the lucrative east-west route.\nMarketed as ‘The Business', the seat+service package will be rolled out onto all six of Virgin Australia's Airbus A330 jets by the end of October 2015.\nThis will see Virgin's Sydney-Perth, Melbourne-Perth and Brisbane-Perth A330 services all boast a business class travel experience of international calibre.\nAustralian Business Traveller put The Business to the test on its inaugural flight from Sydney to Perth.\nSeat Virgin Australia's revamped A330 business class cabin consists of five rows, each with four seats in that pleasing 1-2-1 arrangement which ensures that every passenger has direct access to the aisle, along with ample personal space in terms of both shelving and stowage nooks.\nThe outer seats are angled towards the window.\nThe middle pairs of seats are angled towards one another...\n... and separated by a tinted privacy screen...\n... which slides back so you can chat with your seatmate.\nEach seat's wrap-around shell adds privacy and makes it a little more of a 'suite'.\nDesign\nVirgin Australia's new business class seats are built on the Super Diamond platform from B/E Aerospace, but customised by London design agency Tangerine and Virgin Australia's Creative Director Hans Hulsbosch.\nThe result includes plenty of top-end touches inspired by the luxury automotive market, and the closer you look the more you can detect influences which could have been borrowed from a performance sports car.\nThe seat shells are cast from carbon-fibre, making them at once strong, rigid and light – but rather than cover that material, as many airlines do, Virgin has opted to leave it exposed and dressed in a scored cross-hatch finish which just begs to be touched.\nDusky near-black charcoals, blacks, white panels, silver trim (which is hard to catch in real-life photos) and dashes of Virgin Australia's signature purple contribute to a premium palette that oozes subtle upmarket style.\n`\nFittings such as coat hooks and the LED reading lamp indicate a high degree of attention to detail.\nSenior crew working The Business cabin are also decked out in matching grey threads.\nComfort\nThis is an incredibly comfortable seat – which is no more than you'd expect given that the same basic design is used by Qatar Airways on its international Airbus A380s, A350s and Boeing 787s.\nThe well-padded seat is a generous 21 inches wide between the sidewall and the armrest facing the aisle, but lower the armrest and you gain up to another 7 inches of useable space.\nUnlike the domestic Qantas Business Suite, Virgin's The Business is clad in a durable but soft-weave cloth below the plush leather headrest.\nThe seat itself is slightly inclined by 5.3 inches or 17.3° , even in what would usually be considered the 'upright' position.\nThis is immediately more relaxing than sitting bolt upright, and in fact it's approaching the recline which the Qantas Business Suite permits for taxi, take-off and landing (Qantas trumps Virgin with 21° on its domestic A330s).\nNaturally, you can kick back into a more leisurely mode...\n... set the seat to fully-flat...\n... or find your sweet spot anywhere on the spectrum using a touchscreen panel.\nFor overnight flights such as the red-eye services from Perth to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, the seat converts into a flat two-metre bed that's topped with a memory foam mattress, high-grade cotton pillows and doona.\nSo how's the legroom?\nIn standard upright or recline mode there's room to spare, unless you're of the loftiest pro-basketballer dimensions.\nNote the shelf above my feet in this photo, where you can stow your shoes, the pillow or rolled-up light blanket when not in use.\nWith the seat in lie-flat bed mode there's no problem for average-sized feet, but – as with the Qantas Business Suite – there's not there a lot of wiggle-room to cross your feet at the ankles, for example.\nWork Virgin Australia’s new A330 business class seat is well-suited to making the most of that five-plus hour transcontinental trek as an inflight work session.\nThe large height-adjustable table's got plenty of space for your laptop.\nAlong the side of each seat there's a flat surface where you can plonk work documents.\nWhat's clever about this is that the AC and USB sockets are tucked away in a recess under the larger of the panels.\nThere's room for the little power brickette of a MacBook...\n.. along with a high-power USB socket capable of recharging your tablet en route, plus a standard aircraft three-pin headphone jack.\nThere's a slight gap between the cover and the surrounding panel which lets you close the panel and still have cables running to your laptop, tablet or smartphone and headphones...\n... so that the entire surface of the table remains useful.\nThere’s also a natty little tablet holder hidden away inside the sidewall, behind the literature pocket.\nAnd of course, that concealed USB power port is close at hand.\nAll that remains to transform The Business into a sky-high office for your business is inflight Internet, which could arrive sometime in 2016 powered by the new NBN satellites...\nMeal Part of The Business package is that passengers can choose when to have their meal, rather than dine according to the airline’s schedule.\nAlthough the Sydney-Perth flight averages five hours, with the meal service slated to start around two hours into the journey, this gives business travellers the opportunity to spend more time working without interruption.\nThe latest you can be served a full meal is at 1 hour and 40 minutes before landing, although the ‘express meal’ (comprising a bakery selection, starter, salad and cheese or dessert) can be plated up as late as an hour before landing.\nLunch on my daytime flight from Sydney to Perth began with a choice of king prawns or pumpkin soup – I opted for the prawns served with corn, smoked paprika and chives.\nOn the mains menu:\nbarramundi fillet with avocado, red beans, tomato, basil and lime soft cheese polenta with zucchini, tomato, broad beans and marinated feta lamb meatballs with Middle Eastern spice, zucchini, chickpeas and coriander (below) Dessert options were a raspberry and passionfruit mousse or a cheese platter (below).\nLuke Mangan oversees Virgin Australia’s inflight menu, and as I’ve come to expect, each dish could have come straight from a restaurant kitchen rather than a galley.\nThere's also a new Nespresso coffee service , using a world-first customised Nespresso machine...\n... which delivers one of the best coffees you can get in the sky, from a frothy cappuccino...\n... to a rich flat white.\nEntertainment & Service Service from the Virgin Australia crew was exceptionally attentive during this flight, and even though it was the first commercial service of the new business class, every crew-member was fully up to speed on the seat and its features.\nEach business class seat is fitted with a large 16 inch high-definition screen...\n... while pair of noise-cancelling headphones lurks under the armrest.\nIf you've brought your own cans, fling the airline-supplied ones into the overhead locker and you've recovered a little extra space that's suitable for a water bottle and some inflight amenities.\nA conventional controller lurks under one of the seat-side panels.\nThe on-screen menu is easy to navigate and includes some unexpected extras, such as a chat room which can be used by every passenger on the plane (via a keyboard on the underside of the controller)…\n... although it was a pretty lonely place on my flight.\nThere are, however, two shortcomings with Virgin’s A330 inflight entertainment system.\nThe first is that the screen is fixed in place, rather than having a tilt adjustment, and its position is noticeably below the line-of-sight for a passenger of average height when sitting in the upright position – although with the seat reclined the screen is almost exactly at eye level.\nSecondly, the selection of movies and TV shows is relatively slim and certainly falls behind what Qantas has on tap.\nNobody expects to watch a Lord of the Rings marathon between Melbourne and Perth, but very frequent flyers on the cross-country jaunt could soon have worked through their choice of viewing.\nSummary Superbly designed and well-appointed, Virgin Australia's new A330 business class really is 'the business' – and from the end of October it should be on every one of Virgin's A330 east-west flights, making it the safe bet for doing your transcontinental business travel in style.\nDavid Flynn travelled as a guest of Virgin Australia.\nFollow Australian Business Traveller on

How often do the menus change on flights?\n12 report reply 2 on 20/8/15 by theworld2 Any tips on best seats?\n12 report reply 3 on 20/8/15 by RYS A very thorough review. I enjoyed reading it.\nOne thing, is this statement correct, \"t he well-padded seat is a generous 21cm wide between the sidewall and the armrest facing the aisle\"? Should this be 21 inches instead?\n20 report reply 4 on 20/8/15 by Gian Looks Amazing! Thanks for the review David.\nLooks like the extra wait was worth it.\nHow bloody lucky we are in Australia to have such a high product standard from our two big airlines!\nCan't wait to try it out.\n7 report reply 5 on 20/8/15 by simon brilliant review - thanks\n6 report reply 6 on 20/8/15 by Rod Thanks David , a very good comprehensive report that answers all of my questions.\nI am travelling Sydney- Perth on VA555 Business Class mid Oct and am really looking forward to trying this out. I have checked with the Guest Contactr Ctr. and the seat layout for this flight is 1:2:1 so it's the newy. Before I booked the flight I had on line confirmation from VA that VA555 is the full lunch service which is really something to look forward to especially now that I have read this report.\nCan hardly wait\n7 report reply 7 on 20/8/15 by Chris_PER 5/5 stars for everything. It must be good....\n8 report reply 8 on 20/8/15 by PunditShafton Good to see that the nuts are in a bowl!\n5 report reply 9 on 20/8/15 by StudiodeKadent QF and VA are both doing a great job. This new Business class looks very stylish and the 777 version will be even more spacious (more width, esp in the footwell, due to a wider fuselage allowing a better angle).\nI wonder if VA plan to expand their own fleet sometime...\n8 report reply 10 on 20/8/15 by Rkwm Thank you for a fantastic review . Perfect for long haul international travel . Would certainly be my choice over all competitors . Now all we need is more routes . Let's hope Virgin Australia expand this business product for overseas destinations ... ie. Hong Kong ... Pleeeease !!!\n0 report reply 1 5 minutes ago by Doubleplatinum Pity VA dont fly there!\n18 report reply 11 on 20/8/15 by trevor2 Very cunning from VA, they targeted David's weakness for good coffee! :P\nBut on a serious note, this looks absolutely amazing. And that's coming from very much a seasoned Qantas veteran who has never stepped foot on a VA plane. Perhaps I'll have to 'cross the floor' at some stage.\nThe only surprising point is the lack of a 'Do Not Disturb' sign, although this is minor in the grand scheme of things...\n6 report reply 1 on 20/8/15 by Whatever Hey Trevor2,\nI can tell you first hand that the VA crew are attentive enough to know when not to disturb you. They dont need a gimmy sign to tell them to stay away.\n0 report reply 1 6 minutes ago by Marc Truly in the land of great coffees, nobody can be persuaded with Nespresso! I rate that marginally better than instant. But perhaps it's me being spoilt when I moved here (thank you Belaroma Coffee Roaster :-).\nIt's just a matter of time and we will have mid-air barista's!\n4 report reply 12 on 21/8/15 by Jay Ooomph, five stars in all categories! Must be very slick! That large tray-table is a small but noticeable bonus; I find QF's domestic and international J-class tables too small and flimsy to comfortably work on a laptop (though I've not experienced the BSI upgrade yet).\nStill can't shake my impression that VA's a great option for the solely-domestic business traveller, but wouldn't consider switch unless/until they have a decent international alliance offering. Aahh, if only QF offered Nespresso as well... can't have it all haha!\n1 report reply 13 on 21/8/15 by itchyfeet Great review David, thanks! Future looks bright.\n4 report reply 14 on 22/8/15 by Johnsy Nice Review !\nIt didnt look like as much leg space is available. You mentioned unless you are a basketball player it will be fine. May i ask how tall you are David ? I am 6ft 2 and travelling on this flight late in November then trying VA1 to LAX with the new or slightly bigger setup like this ? Cheers\n4 report reply 1 on 25/8/15 by Bizflyer Im not David but it is very good as I have the pleasure of being 6ft 6 and in bed mode and seated I was very comfotable\n0 report reply 15 1 week, 1 day ago by Traveller14 A good review but one qualification is that neither Qantas or Virgin Australia have A330 planes operating all flights between the east coast and Perth. Some are now B737s, so it is more important than ever to check th actual flight details so that if travelling in business class - or even in economy - you end up on a widebody plane not a 737. Some of Qantas' Airbuses are still in the old configuation so beware of those too.\nThe best way to travel to or from Perth remains in a Great Southern Railway Platinum or Gold (first) class sleeping berth on the transcontinental Indian Pacific train - now that's true luxury!\n-1 report reply 1 1 day, 20 hours ago by Johnsy Are you for real ?? It takes 4 days on a train compared to 4 hours on a plane.. I think you have had to many motion sickness tablets.\n2 report reply 16 2 days, 21 hours ago by ezihose Just Flew on the new Business Class Seats!\nWhat a shame! The old Singapore Airline Version was way, way better!\nThe new version limits your leg spread room and no body likes flying side saddle for 5 hours...\nIts a real pitty that they missed the boat on these new seats..\n4 report reply 17 1 hour, 1 minute ago by Boof David, can you please let us know if you guys are getting paid by VA for these reviews being published again?\nThis isn't a new review (despite the date stating it was published on the 25th of Sept) and I noticed another news article today: 10 things you didn't know about \"The Business\" of which most travellers would know at least 8/10 that almost read like an advertorial for VA's product.\nI really liked this review the first time, but the content on the website is getting repetitive.\n0 report reply 18 42 minutes ago by undertheradar must be a Friday..ausbt re hashing this article from 1 month ago..or maybe it's VA 'paying' ausbt trying to gain more interest for its 'The Business' on VAs minisclule 6 A332s...VA will never match/compete with QFs A332s schedules/routes..Me thinks VA is getting a bit desperate..even after VA does their miniscule 5 B777s... still won't compete/affect QF too much..just my opinion of course\n0 report reply 1 24 minutes ago by Tom Totally agree, not that VA is looking to get any more wide bodied aircraft as their profit was a mere 10 million pre tax, not enough to buy a 10th of a new aircraft. Yes I do think Virgin are struggling to compete with QF, they need more routes, once you have a look at their route map, most of the routes they operate Internationally have another code share agreement, and this is where I think they are losing their money, as people are opting to choose for foreign carriers, as their service is often better.\n-3 report reply 19 38 minutes ago by Tom As it states at the bottom of the review ' David Flynn travelled as a guest of Virgin Australia.' Virgin are obviously either paying AusBT for no.1 spot seeing that this article is 1 month old, or they are coaxing the AusBT team to give 'The Business a good review, and prime position for letting David travel free of charge.\n-2 report reply 1 37 minutes ago by Tom Also not to mention the article on '10 things you didn't know about Virgin's 'The Business'' I would probably say VA are paying AusBT to advertise.\n-1 report reply 1 35 minutes ago by Matt Could also bet you when ever Qantas have or when they do feature any news or reviews - too as speculated by most readers it's a Paid feature by Airline.", "external_links": ["https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=400x300|640x480|620x480&iu=/5478219/Video&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=xml_vast2&unviewed_position_start=1&url=", "http://twitter.com/#!/djsflynn", "http://twitter.com/#!/ausbt", "http://twitter.com/AusBT"], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T08:19:34.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
