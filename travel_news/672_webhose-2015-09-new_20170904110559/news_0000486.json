As the biggest airline in the world in terms of passenger numbers, Delta’s expansion of their Shanon service to their JFK hub provides further opportunity for global connectivity.\n“This is excellent news for passengers from this region who want to fly to JFK and beyond but is also excellent news again for the tourism industry here. There has been a considerable transatlantic market rebound generally over recent years but there is a particular demand for services directly into the west of Ireland through Shannon and we are delighted to be able to facilitate this through airline partners such as Delta.\n“We have a unique tourism product here along the west and south of Ireland and its essential that we have these services to satisfy growing tourism demand. The Wild Atlantic Way has been a stroke of genius for the tourism industry in Ireland and we expect that demand will continue to rise the more people are made aware of all the Wild Atlantic Way has to offer.”\nSource:- Shannon Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T21:08:52.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
