With the luxurious 137,936-GRT MSC Fantasia set to operate in the Arabian Sea between December 2016 and March 2017, the cruise line has already committed the largest-ever ship to the region. \nFor the first time MSC Cruises will offer guests a choice of three different week-long itineraries which will operate in rotation over the 16-week season. All will include calls at Abu Dhabi’s Sir Bani Yas Island, a spectacular desert conservation area and wildlife park that is home to many of Arabia’s native species. Like this upcoming winter season (winter 2015/16) guests will again have the flexibility to choose their preferred embarkation point, with both Abu Dhabi and Dubai on offer. Fly-cruise packages sailing from Dubai will be available using Emirates flights from London, Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow or to Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways flights from London, Manchester and Dublin. The three itineraries will be:- Itinerary 1: Abu Dhabi, UAE; Sir Bani Yas Island, UAE; Manama, Bahrain; Doha, Qatar; Dubai, UAE (overnight); and Abu Dhabi [Dubai embarkation possible] Itinerary 2: Abu Dhabi, UAE; Muscat, Oman; Khasab, Oman; Sir Bani Yas Island, UAE; Dubai, UAE (overnight); and Abu Dhabi [Dubai embarkation possible] Itinerary 3: Abu Dhabi, UAE; Muscat, Oman; Khor al Fakkan, Al Fujairah; Sir Bani Yas Island, UAE; Dubai, UAE (overnight); and Abu Dhabi [Dubai embarkation possible] MSC Cruises executive director UK and Ireland Giles Hawke said having different weekly itineraries on offer in the region would open up the possibility of guests combining sailings into a longer 14-night sailing. “Since MSC Cruises began its Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Oman programme in 2011 it has gone from strength to strength. Every year we have seen increasing numbers of British holidaymakers heading off to explore these fascinating destinations in the sunshine. “Sir Bani Yas Island is an amazing place that gives visitors the opportunity to see a wide range of Arabian wildlife up close. I am sure it will prove very popular.” Launched in 2008, the 3,274-guest MSC Fantasia will be the newest and largest cruise ship ever to operate in the region. Like all MSC Cruises’ Fantasia-class vessels, it includes the award-winning MSC Yacht Club, a luxurious VIP haven boasting 24hr butler service, lounge and private a la carte restaurant. Guests in search of the very best deal can currently get a FREE BALCONY CABIN UPGRADE when they book an MSC Cruises sailing before November 30 this year. That means a seven-night fly-cruise in a balcony cabin aboard MSC Fantasia for winter 2016/17 starts at just £799 per person, including return flights from the UK and overseas transfers.
