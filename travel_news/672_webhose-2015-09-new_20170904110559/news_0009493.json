The sport’s connection to public schools and elite universities, most obviously demonstrated by the annual Boat Race between Oxford and Cambridge, has caused it to be depicted as privileged and relatively inaccessible, while its frequent use of winding river courses makes it hard to attract paying spectators. Sponsors are forthcoming for sports with similar levels of British success, such as cycling, but rowing has found them more difficult to attract. However, change may be afoot. Membership of British Rowing, the governing body, has increased to nearly 30,000 from 25,000 in 2010. Today, there are more than 500 affiliated school, university and community clubs across England, and Sport England says 75,300 UK adults now row at least once a week. A Sport England survey found that once-a-week participation increased by 12pc in the year to last October. Bearing in mind the sport’s demographic profile, with 36pc of British Rowing members aged between 18 and 34, there is plenty for potential sponsors to get excited about. British Rowing is targeting partners with synergies with the sport’s themes of discipline, performance, accuracy, fitness, energy and teamwork. Coverage of rowing events is taking the sport to new audiences. This year’s Henley Royal Regatta was available across the world via live streaming Last year, the US advanced analytics group SAS signed a three-year deal to be official analytics partner to British Rowing, which has signed up Lancashire sports nutrition firm Science in Sport as sports nutrition partner and Nestlé and Müller Wiseman Dairies as associates, supplying cereal and milk. SAS’s mission to “deliver proven solutions that drive innovation and improve performance” was a good fit. The company says its data technology enables coaches, sports scientists and rowers to make better decisions, aiding preparation for major events and providing data modelling to help to develop new talent. “We are committed to helping the rowers improve their performance,” Mark Wilkinson, SAS UK & Ireland managing director, says. “British Rowing has an amazing history and through our partnership we aim to help Great Britain maintain its position as one of the dominant rowing nations.” British Rowing views the deal as a partnership, rather than sponsorship, because of the value it adds beyond finance. “Performance is absolutely key to everything we do,” says Sir David Tanner, the British Rowing team performance director. “By partnering with SAS, we now have the capacity for much more in-depth and speedy analysis of the rowers, allowing us and them to optimise every session.” Despite Britain’s pedigree at Olympics and world championships, rowing has suffered from something of an image problem But as the focus on the rowers intensifies, British Rowing aims to widen perceptions among its growing audience. It is keen to spread awareness of the types of rowing and their boats and races, from multi-lane, 2,000-metre rowing at the Olympics to head races, coastal rowing, touring boats and Cornish pilot gig rowing. More sprint regattas and better promotion of indoor rowing are also helping to broaden the sport’s appeal. Coverage of other rowing events is taking the sport to new audiences. This year’s Henley Royal Regatta was available to view around the world via live streaming – the first time it had been broadcast live since 1968. The women’s Boat Race had equal billing with the men’s, giving it the same broadcasting exposure across 200 countries “The sport is really challenging itself to innovate and prove that it is open to all,” says Ben Wyatt, British Rowing’s marketing and communications director. “There’s never been a better time to get involved in rowing from a participation perspective or in partnering with the sport.” Creating such a virtuous circle could finally give rowing the funding and support that its Olympic performances merit. Funding gap \"Why doesn’t rowing attract more sponsorship, despite the number of medals won at the 2012 Olympics? It’s strange – companies flock to Henley every year, so businesses do know about the opportunities. Rowing has a great deal to offer businesses. Key areas of synergy include: the importance of selecting the right people with the right attitude and a desire to succeed; maintaining focus; and being part of a team with everyone working together towards a common goal. Rowing teams are small, therefore it is imperative that they work together, and that is fundamentally important when you are growing a business. Perhaps more should be made about the psychology behind winning. The mental stamina and attitude needed to succeed as a rower could be a powerful message. If that can be taken to the business community, sponsorship will surely follow.\" - Carol Dawson Brand development consultant, The Qdos Group Read more: • Potential is delivered by a collective approach • Cutting-edge technology moves sport into the digital age • Investment predictions within the sports industry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T23:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T18:49:15.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
