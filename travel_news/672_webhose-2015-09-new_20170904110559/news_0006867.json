The harbour city is home to Australia’s largest event, Vivid Sydney which attracted a record 1.7 million attendees this year, and hosts blockbusters including Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour – Aida, Australian Open of Surfing and the NRL Grand Final.\n“It’s also particularly pleasing to see Coffs Harbour receive its inaugural IFEA World Festival and Event City Award, following the success of major events including Coates Hire Rally Australia, F.I.T Touch World Cup and the Australian Surf Festival.\n“We are also delighted that Newcastle has been recognised at such a prestigious event, demonstrating the continued efforts by Government and locals alike, to establish Newcastle as one of the leading destinations for major events.”\nPresident and CEO of IFEA Steven Schmader said the international panel of judges noted that among the many great world cities considered for the award and recognition, Sydney consistently stands out as a leader in all that they do.\n“It is a tribute to the combined leadership of Destination NSW, your city and events, that Sydney is the only global destination to have received this award every year since its inception, and a pleasure to see the DNA of the successful model that you have built spreading throughout other cities across NSW, as well as being emulated by your peers around the world,” Mr Schmader said.\nSource:- Destination NSW", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:34:11.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
