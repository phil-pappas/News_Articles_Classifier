Its new flagship hotel - which is being created in homage to Eugenia de Montijo, the last Empress consort of the French - will open in January 2016. \nEugenia de Montijo, wife of Napoleon III, was one of the most powerful women of her time. Hedonistic, avant-garde and a philanthropist, she was a 21st century woman, who lived in the 19th century. The opening announcement has been made following a workshop with an expert panel of leading ‘Empresses’ of the 21st century. These leading influential women include TV and sports presenter Charlie Webster; Chief Commercial and Marketing Officer of the Rugby Football Union Sophie Goldschmidt; and author of Write Up, Tess Morris. They came together to discuss the luxury travel industry and what inspires them when booking a 5* hotel. Their aspirations, opinions and views will be used to help influence the final stages of this project. Sara Ramis, Marketing Director for Barceló Hotels & Resorts said, “We have wanted to open a luxury hotel in Madrid for quite some time and we are certain this is the right spot. The building is distinctive and the hotel’s transformation will be a clever combination of the old and the new with the personality of Empress Eugenia de Montijo evident throughout, giving the hotel its distinct character. We are truly excited to make this a ‘co-created’ project, whereby we take inspiration from Empress Eugenia de Montijo and the 21st century Empresses to influence the final design of our hotel’. Right in the heart of the Salamanca neighbourhood – the historical quarter of the city - Barceló Emperatriz’s striking architecture blends beautifully into its chic surroundings of small traditional boutiques, grand embassy buildings and some of Madrid’s most elegant streets. Inside, the hotel offers sleek, light and well-balanced interiors. The 146 rooms will be filled with natural light and fitted with avant-garde furniture with classic details to enhance the identity of the building. The hotel restaurant – set in a small garden area serving Spanish tapas – and a rooftop bar complete this exciting new opening.
