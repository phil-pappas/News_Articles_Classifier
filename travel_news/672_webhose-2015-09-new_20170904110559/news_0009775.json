That means the schools can’t receive state taxpayer dollars.\nThe parties have 20 days to file motions asking the court to reconsider.\nCharters are a type of public school that receive tax dollars but are operated privately. Franta estimated it will take about $14 million to make up for lost public funding if the court’s decision holds.\nHis organization didn’t have the full amount in hand Tuesday. It was still contacting potential donors, which Franta said are likely to include those who contributed to the 2012 campaign, when voters narrowly approved the ballot measure that made Washington one of the last of the 42 states in the nation to allow charter schools.\nSome of the biggest donors then included Microsoft co-founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen and Wal-Mart heiress Alice Walton.\n“We’re working on a broad network of supporters across the country,” Franta said. “I hope that those individuals who played a role in the initiative will also play a role in ensuring the continuity of these schools, assuming it’s necessary to do so.”\nFranta said his association is working under the assumption that if the ruling becomes final, charter schools will lose access to federal funding, as well.\nPublic schools receive federal money to provide school lunches and academic help for low-income students, and for special-education programs for children with disabilities.\nThe court heard arguments in the case last October and issued the long-anticipated ruling after some charter schools had been in session for a few weeks.\nFirst Place Scholars charter school opens in Seattle on Wednesday for its second year of operation, after a turbulent first year marked by personnel and financial trouble.\nIt received its first state payment for the coming school year in August.\nThe other eight schools weren’t due to receive their first public money until the end of September.\nAlong with the charter association’s pledge, some of the schools also promised to keep going despite that they may not get the tax dollars they expected.\n“This decision does not close our school,” Adel Sefrioui, founder and executive director of Excel Public Charter School in Kent, told worried parents at a morning meeting Tuesday.\nSefrioui said his school has raised enough money over the past 18 months to operate through June without state or federal funding.\nBut he encouraged parents to lobby politicians to convene a special legislative session to find a solution. The school plans to bus parents and students to Seattle for a rally Thursday, which is scheduled at Summit Sierra charter school in the Chinatown International District.\nDeanne Hilburn, the mother of a sixth-grade boy at Excel, said at the parents meeting that she wanted her son at the school, which is beginning its fourth week, because he had been having a rough time in the Kent School District.\n“He was angry. He was frustrated. He came home sick to his stomach almost every day,” she said. “In these three short weeks, he has become this young man that I always knew was there.”\nSefrioui estimates it will take about $2 million to operate his school this year, which started with 160 sixth- and seventh-graders.\nCharter-school supporters worked through the Labor Day weekend figuring out how to respond to the high court’s 6-3 ruling.\nThe Washington State Charter School Commission called an emergency meeting for Wednesday morning to respond to the ruling.\nAlthough the high courts in Georgia and Florida have struck down laws creating state commissions to approve charter schools, the Washington ruling is the first to render an entire charter-school law unconstitutional, according to the National Association of Charter School Authorizers.\nThe decision and its timing have generated national headlines and quick opinions, but policymakers are still sorting out what the ruling means. House Majority Leader Pat Sullivan, D-Covington, said legislators in his caucus are “still going through the court opinion, trying to figure it out.”\nLegal staff are preparing options for lawmakers, ranging from a constitutional amendment to making changes to the budget, although Sullivan said he doesn’t believe the latter would resolve the issue.\n“I would guess by the end of this week we’d have some options to consider,” he said.\nA constitutional amendment would require a two-thirds’ majority vote in both the state House and Senate to put it on the general election ballot for a simple majority of voters to approve.\nWhile a special session is a possibility, Sullivan said, there wouldn’t be as much pressure for lawmakers to convene one to propose a constitutional amendment. Lawmakers could vote on such an amendment during their regular session early next year and still get it on the November 2016 ballot.\nSen. Steve Litzow, R-Mercer Island, said he doesn’t think lawmakers will return before January.\n“We’ve been calling for [a special session] the last couple days,” said Litzow, who chairs the Senate Early Learning & K-12 Education Committee. “There doesn’t seem to be a lot of momentum for that with the governor’s office or with the House Democrats.”\nLawmakers, according to Litzow, are trying to understand the decision’s impact on legislative funding and the issue of elected boards.\nJohn Higgins: 206-464-3145 or jhiggins@seattletimes.com On Twitter @jhigginsST", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/jhigginsST"], "published": "2015-09-08T19:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T01:49:07.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
