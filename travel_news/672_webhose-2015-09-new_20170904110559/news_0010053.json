Related Content Road trip warriors visit every county in lower 48 \nLower gas prices are emboldening more Americans to take to the road this holiday weekend -- some 35.5 million are expected to travel 50 miles or more from home for Labor Day. \nIt's the highest travel volume for the holiday since 2008 and a 13 percent increase since 2009, reported Yahoo! Finance, which cited the American Automobile Association. \nThose numbers pale in comparison to 2008, or the year before the Great Recession hit everyone's pocketbook. That year, some 45.2 million traveled for Labor Day, the Yahoo story said. \nGas prices have fallen under $2.50 on average for the first time in 11 years, according to a USA Today report, and could go as low as $2 a gallon before the end of the year.
