The project will allow the introduction of 10-coach trains that will reduce crowding on the Uckfield line and help to meet growing passenger demand. The new longer trains will increase capacity on the line during the morning peak by 50% from July 2016.\nNetwork Rail will build the longer platforms and infrastructure, and Southern Railway will lease, refurbish and run the trains.\n“I am pleased that the platform extensions on the Uckfield line are taking place and will be completed soon. This will mean that commuters and other rail users will be able to have a more comfortable journey as trains are able to take extra carriages. Work is now underway and this will be a huge benefit to the local community in providing a better train service. I look forward to the completion of the work early next year”.\n– Tom Tugendhat MP Last updated Fri 25 Sep 2015 Travel Southern Trains Rail Network Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T22:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T00:44:29.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
