Would you pack this in you carry on luggage? Teenager thought it was a good idea yesterday at Pearson airport. pic.twitter.com/zQDIsbYHpX — Peel Regional Police (@PeelPoliceMedia) September 6, 2015 \nThe explosive disposal unit was dispatched to Toronto’s Pearson International Airport, the screening area was shut down, and the surrounding area was evacuated for about three hours. The device tweeted earlier was an alarm clock, but officials at the airport have to take all precautions. Charges laid. Lesson learnt — Peel Regional Police (@PeelPoliceMedia) September 6, 2015 \nBut the case of the Canadian teenager and his “funny” alarm clock is far from being an isolated incident. \nHere are some ridiculous items people have tried to take on planes: \n1. An avalanche starter Don’t forget your avalanche starter. Picture: Transportation Security Administration Source: Supplied \nA homemade avalanche control charge was discovered in a carry-on bag in 2014 at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, a major airport in the US state of Alaska. The FBI responded and arrested the passenger. \n2. Grenades Travellers try to take all sorts of ‘amusing’ grenades on their holiday. Picture: Transportation Security Administration Source: Supplied \nMore than 140 inert or novelty handgrenades were discovered last year by the TSA in both checked and carry-on bags. \n3. Axes and mallets Don’t leave home without your mallet. Picture: Transportation Security Administration Source: Supplied \nDouble check your bag for axes or mallets. The TSA found this homemade wooden mallet in a passenger’s carry-on last year. \n4. A meat slicer If you like you meat thinly sliced then take your own slicer with you. Picture: Transportation Security Administration Source: Supplied \nA meat slicer was discovered in a carry-on bag at the Southwest Florida International Airport last year. Blades on slicers, blenders, and food processors are razor sharp and are prohibited from being packed in carry-on bags, says the TSA. \n5. Bear mace Protect yourself from bears while on holiday with a few cans of spray. Picture: Transportation Security Administration Source: Supplied \nBeware of the bears — and the repellent. It may come as no surprise, but bear repellent is just one of the many items that are not allowed on commercial flights in the US.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T09:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T11:50:02.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
