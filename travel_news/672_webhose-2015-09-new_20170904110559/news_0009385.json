The award-winning South Florida-based leader in global marketing was recently bestowed with the South Florida Business Journal’s 2015 Fastest Growing Company Award in the category of companies with more than $25 million in revenue. Soon after, 3AWORLDWIDE’s Brazil Hub took home the Services category prize during the 2015 Premio Marketing Contemporaneo event in Rio de Janeiro, an annual awards ceremony organized by the Brazilian Business & Marketing Association .\nOn hand to accept the South Florida Business Journal’s prize were Omar De Windt and Jaime Drysdale, 3AWORLDWIDE’s Director of Public Relations in Miami and Vice President of Business Development and Marketing, respectively. Roberto Amarante from 3AWORLDWIDE Brazil received the Premio Marketing Contemporaneo trophy. Mr. Edward De Valle II, founder and CEO of 3AWORLDWIDE, is thrilled and honored to be recognized by his industry colleagues in Brazil.\nThe South Florida Business Journal’s acknowledgment highlights the way 3AWORLDWIDE’s revenue increased significantly from $11.2 million in 2012 to $141.62 million in 2014—a two-year outstanding percentage growth of 1,164.46 percent. Meanwhile, the ABMN trophy highlights the firm’s local and global relationship with its clientele, as well as its contemporary marketing insight into brand value communication and audience interaction.\n“Our growth is due to five components: hiring the correct talent; training them through programs like 3A-University; servicing our clients; investing in our business; and partnering with key agencies to service global clients. We are extremely assertive in our search to acquire new agencies in strategic markets,” said Edward De Valle II, Founder and CEO of 3AWORLDWIDE.\nThe increasing success behind the 450-plus-employee public relations, event, digital, media planning and buying company was also recognized in 2014, when it ranked 175th on the Inc. 500 list of the fastest-growing companies in North America. In the same year, its newly formed Mexico and Brazil offices ranked among the top 50 advertising agencies in their respective markets.\nBoth the South Florida and Brazil awards come on the heels of the agency’s recent announcement, highlighting a new affiliate partner in China. This alliance enables 3AWORLDWIDE to tap into the Asian market, adding considerable value to the agency’s present client portfolio.\nSource:-3AWORLDWIDE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:10:57.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
