Just ten minutes down the road from Ka’ana is the Holy Cross Primary School and the most wonderful group of fun-loving, dedicated students. \nAnd they needed some help! \nWhile the kids were on summer break, the Ka’ana team stepped in to build them new restrooms in the schoolhouse and a cover for their small garden. \nThe best part? Now that they’re back in school, we can start our “green days” program to teach them how to keep their garden growing beautifully! As we know from our own on-site organic garden , there’s nothing like growing your own healthy goodies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T14:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T08:55:59.130+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
