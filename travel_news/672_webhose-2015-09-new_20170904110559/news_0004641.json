Pilgrims helped the injured by carrying them to safety.\nThe place has suffered some management crisis in the past. Hundreds have been killed in Hajj in similar way and recently a crane collapse also led to the death of 100 people in a major Islamic holy site, the Grand Mosque in Mecca. In 2006, a stampede killed at least 363 people. In the 1980s and 1990s there was a stampede where hundreds died as pilgrims passed a crowded bottleneck area leading to the small pillars.\nCrown Prince Mohammad bin Nayef bin Abdulaziz held an emergency meeting to discuss the stampede, according to the Saudi Press Agency. He has also ordered an enquiry.\nSaudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud later ordered a review of the country’s plans during Hajj. The king said that regardless of the incident, the Hajj season will not stop. The concerned entities will be re-evaluated.\nThe incident occurred when the pilgrims were walking towards the largest pillar when there was a sudden surge in the crowd. This caused a large number of people to fall. They were heading for the ritual where pilgrims throw stones at three pillars in a re-enactment of when the Prophet Abraham stoned the devil and rejected his temptations, according to Muslim traditions.\nThe Saudi government erected three massive pillars specially for Hajj that was completed at $1.2 billion along with a five-story bridge nearby where pilgrims can toss stones. It was meant to be a roomier atmosphere and a more efficient way to accommodate the faithful. But when it comes to managing 2 million people it is difficult to keep track. The ritual is practiced for two days. Pilgrims stone three pillars in Mina which is believed to be the devil who tried to dissuade Abraham from obeying God’s order to slaughter his son. As tradition goes it was God testing Abraham’s faith in him and he then gave Abraham a ram to slaughter instead.\nThe Hajj is an obligation to each Muslim who can make it to the holy city. The pilgrimage is conducted over a period of 5 days. People are garbed in white and symbolise equality and unity before God. A circular procession around Kaaba, the Islamic holy shrine is conducted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T11:40:27.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
