What a perfect location for its homeport!” \nThe Delta Queen began service as an overnight passenger vessel in 1927, carrying passengers, cargo and automobiles between Sacramento, Calif. and San Francisco, Calif. After a brief period of service in the U.S. Navy during World War II, the vessel was sold as war surplus to Captain Tom Greene, owner of the Greene Line Steamers of Cincinnati, Ohio. From 1946 to 2008, the Delta Queen operated as an overnight cruise vessel along many of the prominent rivers and waterways running through America’s heartland and deep South, including the Mississippi, Ohio, Tennessee, Cumberland and Arkansas Rivers. The vessel operated as a dockside hotel in Chattanooga, Tenn. from 2009 until 2014. \n“We are thrilled to designate the port of Kimmswick as the new homeport for the Delta Queen and look forward to returning the city to the important American riverboat town it once was,” said Cornel Martin, President and CEO of Delta Queen Steamboat Company. “The Delta Queen is the last authentic overnight steamboat in America and the city of Kimmswick and Jefferson County are a fitting home as they perfectly represent the history and nostalgia of America’s steamboat era.” \nThe Delta Queen , which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is classified as a National Historic Landmark, was purchased by the current owners in February 2015 with the goal to restore the vessel and return it to overnight cruise service. The steamboat has also recently been designated by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as a National Treasure. \nThe officials of the Delta Queen hope to have the vessel back in service in 2016 but must first secure a Congressional Exemption to allow the vessel to return to the overnight cruise trade. Anyone interested in seeing the iconic Delta Queen cruise again should contact their U.S. representative and senators and urge them to support House Bill 1248 and Senate Bill 1717. \nFor more information, go to www.DQSteamboat.com or visit the Delta Queen Steamboat Company on Facebook and Twitter . \nAbout Delta Queen Steamboat Company \nThe Delta Queen Steamboat Company was founded in 1890 and originally known as The Greene Line.
