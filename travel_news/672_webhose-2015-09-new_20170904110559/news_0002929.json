The issuance of this patent is timely, as demand for biometric authentication is growing rapidly with border control and transportation facilities looking to securely authenticate passenger identity and passengers seeking the ease and convenience of using biometrics to streamline traveling.\nThe claims of US Patent #9,142,070, which was issued on September 22, 2015 , include methods of ensuring the identity of passengers at a transportation facility by acquiring a biometric template of the passenger at check-in and then matching the template at the departure area. The passenger's name and other personal information also is entered into a background check system to flag in real time those passengers who pose a security risk or prevent the entry of passengers who are unable to pass immigration or other checks on arrival. If the biometric template does not match, or if there is an issue with the background check, the passenger is refused boarding.\n\"This patent is the latest addition to our intellectual property portfolio that now includes more than 35 issued patents and many others pending,\" said Jeff Carter , Chief Technology Officer of EyeLock. \"Beyond offering technology for protecting physical environments, EyeLock's formidable intellectual property portfolio covers convenient and secure iris biometric solutions for digital environments, creating opportunities to deploy biometrics across a broad range of IoT (Internet of Things) consumer applications.\"\nEyeLock's iris authentication technology provides an unprecedented level of convenience, security and accuracy. EyeLock's platform uses video technology to deliver a fast and friendly user experience to identify the more than 240 points of unique characteristics available in each human iris, making it the most proven way to authenticate one's identity aside from DNA.\nEyeLock also owns a variety of patents that apply to iris biometrics, iris imaging devices, biometric camera mounts, fraud resistant biometric systems for financial transactions, mobile identity platforms and more.\nAbout EyeLock\nEyeLock is a leader in iris authentication, providing the highest level of security with EyeLock ID technology.
