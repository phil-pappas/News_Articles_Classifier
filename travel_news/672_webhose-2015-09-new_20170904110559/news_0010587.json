Featuring flavourful and playfully presented dishes to appeal to small ones’ big imaginations, the new menu has been created with nutrition at its heart, so parents can rest assured knowing their kids are being fed well.\nThe new menu has been developed in partnership with Nutrition Australia, a non-profit organisation inspiring healthy eating through nutrition education, information and advisory services. Menus are based on a criteria developed by Nutrition Australia’s Accredited Practising Dietitians, to ensure that all the Kids’ Menu dishes are nutritionally-balanced.\nSome of the criteria included ensuring all meals contain a nutritious balance of foods from the core food groups; are low in saturated (bad) fats, low in added sugar and salt; promote food variety; and reflect current standards and dietary guidelines. All meals will provide a balance of vegetables, meat and wholegrain foods plus fruit or dairy where relevant, offering a variety of colours, flavours and textures to educate and encourage kids to enjoy healthy eating.\nA set of 34 main meals (including 12 regional dishes), 7 desserts and 10 drinks have been developed in total to ensure that hotels from across the region can cater to local and international tastes. Each hotel hand-picks a smaller selection of dishes for their menu that is most suitable for the palates of their guests.\nNutritionally-balanced dishes being rolled out across all Holiday Inn Hotels & Resorts throughout Asia, Middle East and Africa\nSome of the dishes on offer include Veggie Pitta Burger, Sushi Rolls, Nacho Bowl, Chicken Noodles, DIY Falafels and for dessert kids choose from favourites such as Apple Crumble, Fruit Popsicle and Banana Split, made with yoghurt instead of ice cream.\nLee Lin Teo, Brand Marketing Director, Holiday Inn Brand Family, AMEA, IHG said: “We know that travelling can make it hard for families to find healthy food for kids on the go. Part of the family appeal of Holiday Inn has always been its signature ‘Kids Stay & Eat Free’ programme. This new Holiday Inn Kids Menu is part of our work to enhance that programme by providing nutritious meals presented in a fun way.\n“But it’s about more than just the food on their plates. This is part of a wider improvement in how we look after kids when they are eating in our restaurants, ensuring they have a fun dining experience from start to finish – from how they are greeted when they enter the restaurant and how the menu looks, down to the colourful utensils they use.”\nLucinda Hancock, Chief Executive Officer, Nutrition Australia Vic Division said: “Good nutrition is essential for good health at all ages. For children, it is particularly important because healthy eating habits are often formed during childhood.\n“It’s great to see Holiday Inn taking the initiative to ensure there are nutritious, delicious and fun foods available for kids to enjoy when holidaying, and we are thrilled to be a part of this exciting collaboration.”\nThe Holiday Inn Kids’ Menu will be available in all Holiday Inn hotels and resorts across Asia, Middle East and Africa by the end of 2015.\nSource:- IHG", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T11:06:29.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
