Uniworld was the only river cruise line mentioned in SAVEUR’s “Finest Cruise Line Dining” category for the 2015 Good Taste Awards, and Food & Travel readers voted Uniworld both the “River Cruise Line of the Year” and highly sought-after “Cruise Line of the Year” at its Reader Awards earlier this month.\n“We take great pride in creating the ultimate dining experience for our guests and we are proud to receive this recognition from SAVEUR and Food & Travel readers,” said Guy Young, president of Uniworld. “All of our European itineraries include multiple opportunities to experience each region’s renowned culinary traditions firsthand, including hands-on cooking classes, private wine tastings, and a grand selection of menu items for even the most discerning of palates.”\nUniworld controls all aspects of their culinary program unlike many other cruise lines that outsource to third-part vendors. Led by Uniworld’s Culinary Director and Global Master Chef, Bernard Zorn, Uniworld’s talented chefs source the freshest and highest-quality local ingredients from farmers’ markets, selecting the best seasonal produce and finding inspiration from regional cuisine. This dedication to farm-to-table culinary experiences enables Uniworld chefs to uncover the finest foods and ensures that each meal embodies the unique character of each region and season. Acclaimed sommeliers pair complimentary distinctive and noble wines, such as Nikolaihof Riesling, the first Austrian wine that received 100 points in Robert Parker, with every meal. In addition, shore excursions offer guests a multitude of memorable culinary experiences, such as exploring various farmers’ markets with Uniworld chefs, interacting with local artisans, and participating in culinary demonstrations and tastings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T11:04:34.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
