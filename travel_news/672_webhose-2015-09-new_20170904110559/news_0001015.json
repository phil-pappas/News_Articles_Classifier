But US researchers have done exactly that and created the world’s most detailed digital body, New Scientist reports. The Visible Human Project researchers, based at the US National Library of Medicine in Maryland, are creating 'virtual humans' and using them for medical research. The Visible Human Project has been used for medical research Photo: The Visible Human Project Sergey Makarov and his team used more than 5,000 slices of an American woman’s frozen cadaver, at one-third of a millimetre intervals, to create a 3D version of the human body. The 59-year-old woman from Maryland, who was obese and died of heart failure, has not been named. Her husband gave permission for her body to be used for medical research. Her body and that of another male were scanned to create the detailed computerised images for the project. The Visible Human Project: the brain Photo: The Visible Human Project “They have ten times as much information as you’d get from an MRI scan,” Dr Fernando Bello, from Imperial College London, told New Scientist. “It means the team will have much more information about organs and their structuring.” Anyone can download the high-resolution ‘human phantom’ images on their computer and run experiments themselves. The digitally reconstructed body is ideal for running experiments that would be too dangerous to try on humans. The project to create a virtual human started in 1986, with the first ‘digital Frankenstein’ created in 1994. Murderer Joseph Paul Jernigan’s body, who was executed by lethal injection, was first used by the Visible Human Project in 1994. He agreed to donate his body for medical research after speaking to a prison chaplain. telegraphsciencetech Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T19:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T19:03:29.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
