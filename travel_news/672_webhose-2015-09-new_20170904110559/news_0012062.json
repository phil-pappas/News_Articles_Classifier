It would be a €6 (approximately £4.50) decrease from Ryanair’s current average ticket price, with Mr O’Leary attributing the anticipated fare cuts to lower oil prices.\nThis week, Ryanair announced that it had hit another milestone, with a record 10.4 million passengers in August, a 10 per cent increase on the same month last year.\nRead more: Fare wars are coming: Ryanair", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1M1ysnY", "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/04/fare-wars-are-coming-ryanair.html"], "published": "2015-09-05T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T19:27:34.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
