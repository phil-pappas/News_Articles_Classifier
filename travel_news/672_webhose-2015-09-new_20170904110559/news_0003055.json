Photo Courtesy of Sea Life Park \nKekaimalu, the only known living hybrid of a false killer whale and Atlantic bottlenose dolphin, or \" wholphin \", gave birth to a female calf on December 23, 2004 at Sea Life Park on the island of Oahu. What is a Wholphin? \nThe name \"wholphin\" was invented in 1985 when a 6-foot dolphin and a 14-foot false killer whale mated and produced an offspring. Prior to that mating, it was not thought possible to mate the two species. Her mother, Punahele, was an Atlantic bottlenose dolphin, while her father, I'anui, was a false killer whale. \nFalse killer whales are actually members of the dolphin family and unrelated to killer whales. Males can reach 22 feet in length and weigh as much as two tons, while females are smaller, reaching 16 meters in length. \nIn the wild false killer whales often associate with other species of dolphins, particularly bottlenose dolphins. They are found most often in warm temperate and tropical waters around the world Kekaimalu's and Her Calf \nKekaimalu (\"from the sheltered ocean\") was the name given to that original offspring who is now the mother of the new wholphin. This was the third pregnancy for Kekaimalu. Both prior offspring have died once in infancy, the other at the age of nine. \nThe new baby, named Kawili Kai is 3/4 dolphin and 1/4 false killer whale. \nThe park's training and veterinary staff spent long hours over the baby wholphin's first four months collecting data and ensuring that mom and calf were receiving the best possible care before publicly announcing its birth and development. \nVery energetic and animated, the baby wholphin interacted well with her mother and trainers. Early in-water interaction with the calf was part of Sea Life Park by Dolphin Discovery's training program, to ensure a high level of trust between calf, mother and trainers, as well as early conditioning for voluntary medical behaviors. Characteristics of a Wholphin \nThe baby wholphin displayed notable characteristics inherited from her hybrid lineage. The coloration is a perfect blend between the light gray of the bottlenose dolphin and black of the false killer whale. \nFor the first months, the calf relied fully on her mother's milk. She nursed intermittently throughout the day and night, with all nursing taking place underwater. \nNursing continued up to about nine months before the calf began sampling her mother's food. At 1-2 years of age, the calf was completely weaned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T18:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T10:48:43.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
