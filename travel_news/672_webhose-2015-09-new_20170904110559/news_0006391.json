Foodies Combine Food Tourism with Boutique Cooking Classes Twitter \nNEWS: Cottage Cooking Asheville is having fun getting the word out about its new business in N.C. It’s taking its cooking on the road, in the water and underwater, in the woods and wherever else it can carve out a cozy place to cook. Cottage Cooking offers cooking classes in a 1915 cottage located just north of downtown Asheville. \n“We’re just having fun with it all,” John Godts, owner of the cottage says. “My partner, Liisa Andreassen and I enjoy being outdoors, so we thought it would be fun to incorporate our cooking activities into our exploring too. Most recently we’ve gone camping, climbing and kayaking. Get the idea?” \nThe couple posts photos on its website and Facebook page so interested folks can follow their cooking exploits. \n“It’s kind of like ‘Where’s Waldo,'” Andreassen says. “People are curious about where we’ll be going and what we’ll be cooking up next.” \nA recent “photo shoot” took place along the Blue Ridge Parkway at a place called “Frying Pan Mountain.” It was a pretty appropriate place to have a little fun with their marketing. Godts and Andreassen created a faux fire out of colorful leaves and were equipped with all the appropriate kitchen utensils too. \nSpoiler alert: A trip to the Florida Keys is on the horizon where the couple is planning to scuba dive. How will they use their skills there? Stay tuned! \nAbout Cottage Cooking: \nFounded in March of 2015, Cottage Cooking classes are geared to home cooks who want to take their cooking up a notch or to people who simply want a fun night out. Plate dates and anniversary celebrations are very popular. \nThe cottage boasts a cozy kitchen, wood stove and eclectic flair. There’s even a “secret door” in the kitchen floor. \nClasses start at $50 per person and the cottage can accommodate up to four people. The cost includes all food, instruction and recipes. Guests are asked to BYOB. Larger groups can be accommodated off site at people’s homes too. \nTo learn more, visit: http://CottageCookingAsheville.com/ or like them on Facebook to follow their cooking adventures at: https://www.facebook.com/Cottage.Cooking . \nView a video here: https://youtu.be/m-_iSG6jtWo . \nVIDEO: \nThis version of news story is Copr. © 2015 eNewsChannels ™ ( www.enewschannels.com ) and the Neotrope® News Network – all commercial and reprint rights reserved.
