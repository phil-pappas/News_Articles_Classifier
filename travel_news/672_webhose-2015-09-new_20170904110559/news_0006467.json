The National Park Service says over a million archival documents and thousands of artifacts that were moved to a museum storage facility in Maryland will be returned Thursday. The project included moving mechanical and electrical systems above flood elevations and upgrading humidity controls in the museum. Installation of the artifacts will begin Sept. 16. Many of the items were donated by families across the country. They include shoes worn by immigrants from Austria, China, Albania, Greece and other countries. The exhibits are expected to be fully restored by early October.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T09:41:57.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
