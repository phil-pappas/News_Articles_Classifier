For SA, the index provided good news in an environment of falling confidence levels, job losses, and sluggish economic growth.\nThis improvement boosts SA’s appeal as an investment destination and indicates that \"something is obviously being done in things like the labour market and education\", World Economic Forum economist Caroline Galvan said.\nAn increased uptake of information and communication technologies, improvements in innovation and labour market efficiency, and better health and primary education, helped lift SA’s position. SA ranked 107th on labour market efficiency from 113 in 2014.\nFactors that weigh on the country’s competitiveness and that need to be addressed include corruption, state regulation, inefficient electricity supply, an inflexible labour market and quality of education. The forum warned that higher secondary enrolment rates would not be enough to create the skills needed for a competitive economy.\nHowever, despite the improvement overall, SA still ranks very low on labour-employer relations, languishing in last place, flexibility of wage determination (137th), hiring and firing practices (138th) and the correlation between pay and productivity (127th).\n\"Countries where employees and employers enter into dialogue about what the country needs in order to progress normally tend to have better labour market flexibility,\" Ms Galvan said.\nFederation of Unions of SA (Fedusa) general secretary Dennis George conceded that employer-employee relations in SA were poor. Training was necessary for both parties in negotiations for better conditions and higher wages in a way that was mutually satisfying, he said. He also proposed a code of conduct to regulate collective bargaining processes.\nWhile the forum could not prescribe how to solve challenges, a common factor among high-ranking countries was that \"talent and education is at the heart\" of their economies, Ms Galvan said.\nThat there were fewer countries ranked this year (140) compared with last year (144), did not affect SA’s ranking, she added.\nLocal businesses that took part in the survey identified restrictive labour regulations, inefficient state bureaucracy, inadequate supply of infrastructure, policy instability, and an inadequately educated workforce as the main stumbling blocks to doing business in SA.\nTrends since 2007 showed that competitiveness contributed to an economy’s resilience, another reason productivity growth should be prioritised.\nMauritius remained sub-Saharan Africa’s most competitive economy. It took 46th position globally. Rwanda and Botswana were among the top performers in the region. Countries hard-hit by the Ebola crisis ranked low in both the regional and global competitiveness rankings.\nThe most competitive country in the world is Switzerland, followed by Singapore and the US in second and third place.\nCompetitiveness is defined as a set of institutions, policies and factors that measure an economy’s productivity, which sets the level of prosperity. It uses 12 pillars including the macroeconomic environment, institutions, financial market development, business sophistication, health and primary education to measure this.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:50:26.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
