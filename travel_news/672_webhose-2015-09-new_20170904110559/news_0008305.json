How to Turn It Around The Wall Street Journal. 6 days ago Charlie Wells On some vacations, the moment travelers check in, they wish they could just check out.\nAfter spending months and thousands of dollars to book an idyllic escape from the stresses of working life, many people arrive only to experience a sense of deflation. The weather is bad, the beach is crowded, the service comes with a side of bad attitude—and the feeling of disappointment can easily take over the rest of the trip.\nFew vacation planners or frequent travelers would advise disappointed travelers to head home early. An initial sense of disappointment or letdown is natural, they say. According to a 2013 study in the Journal of Travel Research that surveyed over three dozen travelers from the U.S. and the Netherlands, vacationers feel worst at the beginning and the end of their trips, and best during the middle 60%.\nFirst impressions are so crucial for luxury travelers that the Waldorf Astoria has a concierge service to make sure those first moments run smoothly, says John Vanderslice, global head of luxury and lifestyle brands at Hilton Worldwide, which includes the Waldorf Astoria. Before guests even reach the front door, a staffer emails guests with his or her contact information. Upon arrival, visitors are allowed to skip the front desk and check straight into their own rooms, which can take some of the stress off an arrival.\n“You always want an initial safety net from a guest-experience standpoint,” says Mr. Vanderslice.\nTo turn around a vacation gone wrong, experts suggest travelers sometimes throw out an itinerary and embrace spontaneity. They also recommend using the trip’s negatives to create a greater sense of camaraderie among traveling companions.\nBeing open to spontaneity is the crucial element in reworking a failing holiday, says Dane Tredway, a private trip designer at Toronto-based tour company Butterfield & Robinson. Too often, travelers spend months planning out exactly what they hope to do in a limited period without taking into consideration outside forces that could shatter their plans, he says. The important thing is to cut losses and try something else, which is something Mr. Tredway says he helps people do on trips gone awry. “These spontaneous moments usually end up being the most memorable parts of the whole trip,” he says.\nLauren Juliff, a 27-year-old travel blogger, arrived at Playa del Carmen on Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula and to her surprise found she absolutely hated the busy, boozy place.\n© Lauren Juliff She had seen beautiful pictures on Google Images and heard rave reviews from friends, and so she paid in advance for her own apartment in the city. She thought it would be a great place to rest and recover.\nInstead of peaceful downtime, Ms. Juliff says she mainly remembers “shirtless guys wandering around drinking beers at 11 a.m. and bars pumping out loud music.” She wandered fruitlessly from one kitschy T-shirt shop to the next, looking for something that was more her speed.\nA few days later she took the advice of some locals and began to explore farther from the beach. She found the quiet, more-authentic places she had been seeking. She ended up finding a place to do Pilates, delicious street food and a park where she could write.\nNow, Ms. Juliff says when on vacation she remembers to ask the locals for tips. “Don’t ask about where tourists would want to go to have fun,” she says. “Ask them about where they would want to go to have a good time.”\nThe opposite happened to 30-year-old Elisabeth Spenger, of London, who was traveling around South America and booked a two-day guided tour down the Amazon River. She had heard great things from acquaintances, but her guide turned out to be far from talkative, and the only other people on her trip were retirees.\nAfter the group drove and boated for hours to a lodge “in the middle of nowhere,” Ms. Spenger says she felt something she hadn’t expected to feel in the middle of a rainforest: boredom.\n“They were so nice,” says Ms. Spenger. “But we just had nothing in common.”\nAt first she kicked herself for not being better prepared for all the time she had to spend alone. But after a while, she realized she should appreciate her boredom, at least for the duration of the tour. She borrowed one of the few books she found in the lodge and tried to focus on that. “I guess that’s what you want on this sort of trip,” she says.\nSometimes there can be no escape from a lousy vacation. Experts say travelers and their companions have one alternative: make light of a bad situation.\nNegative external circumstances—be it bad weather or rude service—can bring a group together. It creates something of a common enemy that the travelers can rally around, says Mr. Tredway, the trip planner.\nJoyce Lu and a group of friends came together to save their Caribbean cruise reunion from disaster.\nThe feeling hit a few hours after the ship set sail from Miami. The weather wasn’t great. The service was worse. And the friends, who had flown in from around the country to celebrate Ms. Lu’s 30th birthday at sea, had been booked into rooms scattered around the ship, rather than in a bloc. The cruise had no onboard cellphone service, so to find one another they had to resort to using in-room telephones. “It felt like we were stuck in the 1990s,” Ms. Lu says.\nThe weather got so bad that the ship couldn’t stop at CoCo Cay, in the Bahamas, an outing Ms. Lu had been looking forward to. Then on the last night, she and her friends got kicked out of the ship’s dining area for singing “Happy Birthday” too loudly.\n“The horrible service,” she says. “It just became a running joke.” Despite it all, Ms. Lu says she and her friends had a great trip.\n“It was fun,” she says. “After we got over the frustrations.”\nWrite to Charlie Wells at Charlie.Wells@wsj.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyxle.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Trump", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA36Tom.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;How", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBm5Htr.img&quot;}}", "http://www.marketwatch.com/mw2/mediarss/wsjdn/wsjtv.asp?type=wsj-section&amp;query=Lifestyle&amp;count=30&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://live.wsj.com/video/how-salvage-bad-vacation/1722B9D2-D5F5-4D07-B0B9-B4481DB3AD72.html&quot;,&quot;sourceFriendly&quot;:&quot;The", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;travelarticle&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBm7MyX.img&quot;}}", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBm8hwE%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBm8mC7.img&description=Lauren+Juliff", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBm7U7c.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BBkkQsl&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Fox", "http://online.wsj.com/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBm5Cfr.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB4kdvW&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Are"], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T20:01:52.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
