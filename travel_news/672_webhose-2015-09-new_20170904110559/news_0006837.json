Three years later, while writing his first book, The Black Echo, he created the lead character, LAPD Detective Hieronymus Bosch. Little did he know then that Bosch would go on to feature in his next 25 books, making Connelly one of America’s bestselling authors. \nEarlier this year, Bosch found his way to the small screen, as Connelly was approached for a TV adaptation of his books. He agreed. One season later, there is no doubt that the show has caught on. The reason, says Connelly, has got a lot to do with the audience’s fascination with police procedural dramas. “There is definitely something reassuring about crime shows. The detectives work relentlessly until they catch the bad guys, and that appeal is universal,” he says. \nAlthough there are a lot of thrillers and crime dramas on air in the USA currently, Connelly feels not all of them work well with the audience. “When it comes to quality, not many shows are that great,” says the writer. \nConnelly has never been to India. But he admits he’s interested in setting a plot here. Perhaps, Mumbai will feature in his next novel? “I always like to put a particular character in an unfamiliar setting, where he is a fish out of water. In my books, Bosch travels a lot. I have never visited India, but I hope to come there soon, and when I do, it might spark my imagination and possibly lead to a plot,” he says. \nWhile working on the first season of the TV show, Michael Connelly was involved in the scripting process. “Writing a book is different from writing for television,” he says, adding, “Here, there is a writing room, where six writers work together on the script. It has been a refreshing and fun experience, unlike writing a novel.” At the end of the day, he is glad that everyone has to check whether he is happy with the final storyline. \nAmerican film and TV actor Titus Welliver plays the lead role in the show. Connelly reveals that he was instrumental in getting him on board. “I am happy with Titus. He does justice to the character. I have seen him play similar roles on other shows. I thought he would be the best person for this one,” says the author, who is happy that the TV show, Bosch, has now released in India.
