The Company intends to fund such purchases through working capital.\nThe Company believes that its current share price does not reflect the underlying value of the Company, and that purchasing shares for cancellation will increase the proportionate interest of, and be advantageous to, all remaining shareholders. The Company intends to buy back Common Shares for cancellation from time to time when it determines the price at which they are trading is undervalued and that such purchases provide the best use of available cash.\n\"Alongside our shareholders, Intertain has built a very profitable business - a company with one of the highest rates of regulated revenue globally in the online gaming space,\" said John Kennedy FitzGerald , President and CEO of Intertain. \"For that we are extremely thankful. Given, however, where our share price is today, management and our Board are of the strong view that the best investment available to the Company at this time is its own equity.\"\nThe NCIB is subject to acceptance by the TSX and, if accepted, will be made in accordance with the applicable rules and policies of the TSX. Common Shares will be purchased through the facilities of the TSX at prevailing market prices at the time of purchase. In accordance with the applicable TSX rules, the maximum amount of daily purchases may not exceed 25% of the average daily trading volume of the Common Shares, and the Company may make, once per calendar week, a block purchase of Common Shares not owned, directly or indirectly, by insiders of Intertain that exceeds the daily repurchase restriction.\nAbout The Intertain Group Limited\nIntertain is an online gaming company that provides entertainment to a global consumer base.
