Developed by digital production agency Rewind, the fully immersive experience will be introduced from September and will run on the new Samsung Gear VR headset. The team created an interactive brochure, allowing potential event bookers to visit the venue from the comfort of their office. VR will give the user the feeling that they’re in the venue, and simply moving your head allows you to look around each room. \nHighlighting four individual event set-ups in the venue, and generating a 360 degree image for each location, virtual data was created of the main entrance, a drinks reception set-up in the party area, dinner dance in the world stage and cocktail party spaces. As a popular tourist attraction, Madame Tussauds’ daily site-visits and show-rounds are limited during opening hours; the newly installed VR technology is seen as a longer term solution to alleviate this. To capture the data, six photos were taken in each room before being stitched together to form a long image encompassing a full 360 degree view around the viewer, known as an ‘equirectangular projection’, which is viewed through the VR headset. Sound was also recorded on site and can be added for a fully immersive experience. Gareth McTiffin, Marketing and Events Manager commented: “We’re constantly looking at ways to develop our events portfolio and for new, forward thinking initiatives to showcase our products. We’ve seen an increase in sales enquiries again this year; Virtual Reality is not only a way to support this growth but to further enhance our digital investment and improve the booker experience. Virtual Reality and Rewind are at the cutting edge of the industry and is set to push the boundaries of events.” Solomon Rogers, Founder and Managing Director at Rewind added: “Virtual Reality is set to explode over the next 12 months as more and more headsets start to hit the market. As an early adopter of the technology Madame Tussauds have put themselves at the head of the crowd by producing an interactive tour of their event spaces. The benefits for the events industry is huge, with a single headset they are able to take their event space to their customers and let them see it first hand at their own desk.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T15:20:29.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
