The sequel is about to arrive in cinemas and also stars airberlin: the airberlin sandwich student, Nicoletta Lugo and her fellow Berliner trainees, Annika Krueger and Ramiya Mahamagamoorthy, feature as extras. The airberlin chocolate heart also plays a role in the film. Along with Nicoletta Lugo, it makes an appearance in the scene at the airberlin ticket desk, together with Karoline Herfurth. D-ALPE, a type A330-200 Airbus that airberlin uses for long-haul flights, also has a part. Seat 23D is expected to gain cult status among Elyas M’Barek fans, as this is where he sat during filming. \nThe limited edition sick bags now being used on airberlin flights, and making many passengers smile when they understand the reference to the first film, also have the potential to become collectors' items. Elyas M’Barek is currently one of Germany's most sought-after actors, so some business travellers will make their daughters happy if they take a sick bag home. They are of course more than welcome to take one with them. \nAnother new feature is the Fack Ju Goehte trailer that is currently being shown on the entertainment system during boarding on all short and medium-haul flights. airberlin has already published an interview with Elyas M’Bar in the August edition of its in-flight magazine. \nThe final door of the promotional count-down calendar will contain a special airberlin highlight for fans of Fack Ju Goehte.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T15:02:33.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
