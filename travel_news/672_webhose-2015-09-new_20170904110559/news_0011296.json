Service channels will evolve from 2015 to 2021 as small repair shops close and are replaced by franchised chains and mass merchants. Overall growth will be driven by an increasing average vehicle age. However, shops capable of repairing and maintaining foreign nameplate vehicles will enjoy higher growth than those specializing in domestic brands as the vehicle population shifts in favor of Asian automobiles. This analysis includes findings from Frost & Sullivan's annual vehicle owners' maintenance survey, combined with secondary data and insights from the analyst team. It gives a forecast for service centers by type, vehicles in operation by nameplate, and total automotive parts stores, as well as insights into consumer behavior and key conclusions.\nKey Findings\nAutomotive Maintenance and Repair Market: Key Findings, United States , 2014â€“2021\nGrowth to be concentrated in the maintenance and repair of foreign nameplates.\n- The number of domestic nameplate vehicles to remain stable or decline slightly in the coming years, suggesting reduced demand.\n- Total Honda, Toyota, Hyundai/Kia, and Mazda nameplates to grow several times faster than for domestic brands, enhancing demand for technicians to service these brands.\n- Increased specialization of service providers will occur. 2 Tire dealers are in a solid position to grow as multi-service providers.\n- Tire dealers are in a solid position to grow as multi-service providers, adding services-such as transmission flush, windshield repair, and tire rotation-and products, such as spark plugs and wiper blades.

Some, such as Ford and Volkswagen, will also expand the number of quick-lube lanes at their dealer sites. 3 Changing consumer behavior to increase the degree of competition within service channels.\n- Do-it-yourself (DIY) activity to continue declining over the medium-to-long term as vehicle architectures evolve and fewer consumers have experience performing routine maintenance.\n- Oil change intervals to lengthen due to increased use of synthetic lubricants and premium filters.
