This year the country celebrated the 193rd anniversary of the proclamation of its independence from Portugal.\nThe Independence of Brazil comprised a series of political events that occurred in 1821–1824. People gather in the road celebrating with banners, balloons, and streamers to celebrate the significance of this day. The carnival is held the whole day where people of all ages take part and have a gala of a time. In the evening people gather to see amazing fireworks in the clear sky. To mark the significance of the day, this year also, the parade in Rio de Janeiro began at 9:15 am at Avenida Presidente Vargas, which saw the gathering of as many as 4,000 people, with 3,000 soldiers, five hundred civilians, and five hundred students.\nStaff of the Federal Highway Police (PRF), the Municipal Guard, former fighters of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB), public schools, state, groups of associations and civil organizations such as the Union of Scouts of Brazil, Lions Club, Freemasonry, the Red Cross and the Legion of Good Will (LGW) were all a part of the parade.\nFive facts you didn’t know about Brazil’s independence and the war with Portugal:\nThe Portuguese royal family fled to Rio de Janeiro after Napoleon decided to invade Portugal for supporting Britain in its war with France in 1807. There could have been a vastly different history had the royal family not moved to Brazil.\nRio de Janeiro was the capital of Portgual from 1808 until 1822 albeit it was an ocean away.\nThe slaves of Brazil were freed so that they could fight in the army and navy during the war with Portugal.\nScotsman Thomas Cochrane led the Brazil’s war at sea.\nThe Brazilian empire was the last monarchy in the country before it became a republic before it was overthrown by a clique of military leaders.\nFor ages Brazil has represented the great escape into a prehistoric, tropical heaven, igniting the Western imagination like no other South American country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T09:21:34.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
