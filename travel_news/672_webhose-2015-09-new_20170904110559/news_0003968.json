Island getaways in the South Pacific and the Bahamas, meanwhile, are down anywhere from 13% to 29%.\nIn short, if you haven’t yet planned a fall retreat, this is a good year to go for it.\nBut when should you travel to get the absolute lowest flight prices?\nNBC News says that you’d be smart to plan your getaway for the first or second weekend of November, when search engine Hopper.com estimates that the average domestic round-trip ticket will go for about $262. (Midweek flights can be even cheaper, of course.) You may want to avoid traveling on Columbus Day weekend (October 10-12), when flights will be a tad pricier. And definitely don’t wait until the second half of November: prices will be on the upswing in the lead-up to Thanksgiving weekend.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.nbcnews.com/business/travel/airfares-9-percent-lower-average-2014-fall-travel-n419677", "http://time.com/money/"], "published": "2015-09-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T02:32:37.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
