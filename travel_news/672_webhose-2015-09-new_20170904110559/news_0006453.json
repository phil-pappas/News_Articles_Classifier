You have to take them to where it is.”\nThese days, more travelers are finding the Milky Way’s doorstep in the Land of Enchantment.\nLong revered by artists for the quality of its daylight, New Mexico is also a destination for stargazers who praise the depth and clarity of its nighttime darkness. From Santa Fe to Silver City, the state abounds in dark-sky sites where the absence of light pollution and the clear, high-country air make it possible to see stars by the thousands with the naked eye. Many of these sites are no more than a couple of hours’ drive from Albuquerque or El Paso, and some are closer than that.\nEnjoying New Mexico’s night sky can be as simple as “sitting in the hot tub, lying back and looking up,” O’Connor says. Those looking for a fuller experience can do so in a variety of settings, from an overnight camp-out or guided evening excursion to the back porch of a secluded luxury inn.\nEnchanted Skies\nPrime viewing season is in the fall, after the summer thunderstorms have subsided. In October, the astronomy community surrounding the Very Large Array radio telescope hosts a stargazing extravaganza that draws hundreds of enthusiasts to camp out in the mountains about two hours south of Albuquerque. The Enchanted Skies Star Party (enchantedskies.org) offers four nights of dark skies, plus a full schedule of daytime activities and access to hotels, restaurants and other services in the nearby village of Magdalena.\nJudy Stanley, the event’s chairwoman, says the Star Party is great for families and first-timers.\n“We provide star maps, and we give green-laser tours of the sky,” she said. And you don’t have to bring your own telescope. Newcomers can see plenty with a pair of good binoculars, she said. It’s also easy, she added, to make friends with an accomplished astronomer who is willing to share his or her eyepiece.\n“Another big draw is the wide range of people that you get to meet,” she added. “You might hear one of the scientists who’s studying dark matter or galaxy formation or black holes. You might hear amateur astronomers giving talks on astrophotography.”\nStanley’s other advice: Be respectful of lighting restrictions, and bring a lawn chair and some blankets. This year’s 22nd annual event takes place Oct. 14-17, and costs $50 per adult for all four nights. Kids younger than 17 are free.\nAn evening’s adventure\nIf you don’t want to stay out all night, and you like your stargazing closer to the city, Peter Lipscomb offers an elegant solution. A guided sky tour from Lipscomb’s Astronomy Adventures (astronomyadventures.com) makes it possible to enjoy an early dinner in Santa Fe or Albuquerque and still get far enough away from the bright lights for a memorable evening under a sky crowded with stars.\nLipscomb knows the night sky well. For several years, he wrote a weekly astronomy column for the Santa Fe New Mexican , and has also written for Sky & Telescope and Astronomy magazines. Several nights each week, guests gather at dusk in the high desert south of Santa Fe, where he uses a laser pointer and a 20-inch telescope to acquaint them with the heavens.\nOn a recent evening, he hosted families from Arkansas and Pennsylvania, each guest in turn stepping up to the eyepiece to view planets, star clusters and nebulae.\n“They’re seeing something that they can’t see from their backyard anymore,” Lipscomb said afterward.\nA telescope in every room\nAfter seeing his guests routinely transfixed by the night sky, O’Connor bought a 10-inch telescope and began giving informal sky talks. Today, each of the five guesthouses at Casitas de Gila (casitasdegila.com) has its own spotting scope and star chart. Hiking, horseback riding and other daytime options are abundant, and when the sun sets, light pollution isn’t a problem.\n“The skies here are basically as dark as they can get,” O’Connor says. Guests include professional astronomers and serious amateurs, who bring their own gear and set it up on a central patio. Rates start at $165 per night for a one-bedroom unit, with discounts for multiple-night stays.\n“The nice thing about the casitas is you don’t have to camp out in the boonies,” to enjoy the night sky, O’Connor says.\nAmong couples visiting the property, he adds, it often happens that, “one partner is interested in the stars and the other is interested in more traditional nighttime activities, like sleeping in a comfortable bed. Both parties are satisfied here.”\nFormer Dallas Morning News staffer Steve Scott lives in Albuquerque.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T04:06:49.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
