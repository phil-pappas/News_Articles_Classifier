It feels instinctive to crouch. I force my knees to straighten, pulling my shoulders up and straightening my body with an ironing-board-like posture. I slam my crampons down with a satisfying crunch into a steep slope of ice. It’s merely walking with spiky shoes I think to myself. I suddenly feel myself tipping forwards and I start to run downwards, propelling myself in accidental momentum with as much grace as a chicken attempting to fly. I give my guide an embarrassed smile, as if it was my intention to careen down the icy-blue glacier. I regain my composure after a clumsy stumble, taking in the opportunity to marvel at the surroundings. As far as the eye can see, the gem-blue glaciers of the Mer de Glace contrasted against the snow-hooded mountains of the Alps. The sun is a glittering eye of luminous gold, reflecting the white and blue glaciers. It is a place of harsh and stark beauty. Throngs of tourists visit the glacier every year Photo: Getty I watch as a trickle of melt-water seeps beneath my feet. Our guide, Frederick, beckons us and explains solemnly that 2015 was one of the hottest summers for more than 300 years. The Mer de Glace melts rapidly every minute under this heat. It is the largest glacier in France, but despite its size it moves 1cm an hour. I’m shocked by the rate of the glacial retreat. I continue the trek across the ice, wrapped in my thoughts. Apart from the crunch of our footsteps, everywhere around me is silent, white and other-worldly. The glacier is in a constant state of flux and we soon encounter a slide of icy water tumbling into a bottomless crevasse like the devil’s waterslide. The mere sight of rushing water sends a shiver through me. We navigate around the crevasse carefully, reaching a vertical wall of blue, steep ice. I am suddenly conscious of the ice axe in my hand. I’ve been using it as a short and inefficient walking stick for the past few hours. I take hold of it sheepishly, excited to use the equipment for its true purpose. The Mer de Glace glacier moves about 1cm a year Photo: Getty Frederick lets down a rope, anchoring the climb with an ice screw. I stab the front spikes of my crampons straight into the ice and am pleasantly surprised as the equipment bears my weight. My ice axe bounces off on first attempt. I swing harder and with a final exerted pull, I roll over, relieved to be on horizontal ground. We trek onwards until Frederick draws our attention to what looks like carved ice. “This is why they call it the Sea of Ice.” I marvel at shelf after shelf of rolling waves of ice. But despite the beauty, the gurgle of melt-water is ever present, like a subtle reminder of the fragility of it all.
