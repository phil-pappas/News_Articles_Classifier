These modern-day Magellans want to visit every place in the world where a line of latitude intersects a line of longitude: all 16,347 of them, discounting some near the poles and others at sea. What is there to do at a confluence? Not much. Take a photo, submit it to the website. These are, after all, completely arbitrary spots. But there's one confluence on Earth that usually gets visited with a bit more pomp and circumstance: the elusive \"Golden X.\"\nEvery point on Earth can be measured by its distance from two lines. Let's review for a moment: the Earth's surface is measured using 180 degrees of latitude, from 90 degrees N at the North Pole to 90 degrees S at the South Pole, and 360 degrees of longitude from 180 degrees W all the way back around to 180 degrees E—which are both actually the same meridian, the International Date Line. The \"zero\" lines on the two axes are the Equator and the Greenwich Prime Meridian, respectively.\nTake a journey to the \"center\" of the Earth. That means that Earth's zero point—its center, its belly button, if you will—would be at the \"degree confluence\" where the Equator meets the Prime Meridian. Let me note again that this is a pretty arbitrary point, since Greenwich, England was only chosen to host the zero line through international convention, not any inherent geographical awesome-ness. (And the French were pretty peeved since they thought Paris deserved the honor more.) But nevertheless, there is such a zero point. The Prime Meridian passes through France, Spain, and northern Africa before intersecting the Equator about 3,500 miles due south of Greenwich.\nSadly, Earth's navel is naval. And what will explorers find when they reach the zero point? Not much. The \"Golden X,\" as sailors call it, is located in the middle of the Gulf of Guinea, in the South Atlantic. The nearest land, the Ghana coast, is 350 miles to the north. The islands that form parts of São Tomé and Príncipe and Equatorial Guinea (a country which, despite its name, never touches the Equator) are a few days' sail to the east.\nBut if you do visit the Golden X, you join a secret society. For centuries, naval crew and other sailors have observed a maritime ritual called \"crossing the line\" when a ship passes the Equator into the Southern Hemisphere. Sailors how have never \"crossed the line\" are called \"slimy polliwogs\" and must pay homage to the sea-god Neptune to attain their new status, as \"shellbacks.\" (For many years, cruel hazing accompanied the Equatorial transit, but today it's all in good fun.) Ships will still go miles out of their way to \"cross the line\" at the Golden X, because pollywogs who graduate there get a special honor: they become \"Royal Diamond Shellbacks\" aboard British ships, or \"Emerald Shellbacks\" if they're Americans. It may be a made-up honor about a made-up spot, but it's still a pretty elite club.\nMore from Condé Nast Traveler:\nThe 2015 Friendliest and Unfriendliest Cities Around the World\n100 Top Hotels & Resorts in the World\n50 Things to Do in the U.S. Before You Die\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2013-08-19/paris-meridian-maphead-ken-jennings?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2014-10-20/top-100-hotels-and-resorts-in-the-world-rca-2014?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2015-06-27/things-to-do-in-america-all-50-us-states?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2015-08-14/the-2015-friendliest-and-unfriendliest-cities-in-the-world?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://confluence.org/?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://www.cntraveler.com/?mbid=synd_msn"], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T22:29:53.615+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
