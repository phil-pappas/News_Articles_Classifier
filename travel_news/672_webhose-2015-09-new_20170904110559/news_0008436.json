From 8 – 11am on Tuesday 6 October, event professionals, local businesses and fellow London venues are invited to drop in to The Deck and get their morning off to a great start with a fully stocked breakfast bar, interactive activities and some brilliant breakfast inspiration. \nThe National Theatre’s executive head chef Simon Flint has crafted a menu based on current breakfast trends, including a granola station with dried fruits, homemade compotes and local honey, grilled sourdough canapés with Pico de Gallo and avocado and hot dishes such as smoked salmon on rye bread, maple cured bacon baps and a signature English breakfast tart. Guests will be able to stay refreshed with a DIY breakfast cocktail bar, where they can choose from a selection of healthy ingredients and top them up with either soda water or Prosecco. London Breakfast Meetings Week is all about encouraging venues and event bookers to make the most of the opportunities morning meetings can bring, so The Deck is lining up a series of speakers and demonstrations to give attendees some inspirational ideas to take away. Author Sarah Malcolm will be talking about the benefits of healthy eating, following the publication of her new book, Happy, Healthy and Hungry. A yoga instructor from Yogasphere will be on hand to lead a series of 10 minute workshops at 8.30, 9.00, 9.30 and 10.00am, giving guests a taste of the new breakfast and yoga meeting packages being offered by The Deck which help to de-stress and boost productivity for the day. Guests will be able to take part in a fun personality quiz to find out what their morning meeting mood is, and results from the latest London Breakfast Meetings Week research will be revealed. There will also be goodie bags to take home, with homemade health bars, stress balls, a fruit smoothie and a copy of the London Breakfast Meetings Week toolkit. Charley Taylor-Smith is head of hospitality and commercial business development at The Deck: ‘Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, not just for giving your brain and body the nutrients they need but also for businesses catching employees at their most productive and for venues looking to develop new revenue streams,’ she says. ‘The Deck is a big supporter of London Breakfast Meetings Week and we are delighted to be hosting an open morning to share our breakfast ideas with other venues and event organisers, who we hope will leave inspired to hold more of their own morning events.’ Registration for the London Breakfast Meetings Week open morning is now open – to secure your place visit http://bit.ly/1EO4jX7. London Breakfast Meetings Week is looking for more venues to get involved by hosting a breakfast event of their own or launching a new morning meeting package to clients. A dedicated venue toolkit is available for download with top-tips, resources and guides designed to help venues effectively take part in the week.
