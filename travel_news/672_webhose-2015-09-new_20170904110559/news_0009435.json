We discovered this about four years ago. What I always says is all we've really done for Alex is fed him and helped him to get into the best possible shape . We’ve built an organic vegetable garden at home in Surrey, and everything Alex eats is natural. We use no pesticides. We only use organic nitrogen and compost fertilizer. Same with the trees – apples, pears, plums – never sprayed. He spends a fortune at Wholefoods and then comes home to pick stuff up from the garden. Alex is on the Mike Dolce diet and he worships this guy Dolce, [a weight-management coach] who helps many fighters get to the right weight and fight while staying healthy. Cooking for the big man is no mean feat. He'll eat fresh courgettes from the garden, served with vegetables, four eggs and non-cow-dairy cheese. Family guy: Alex, Rick and younger brother Ollie Alex eats what I would describe as a macrobiotic diet with meat. As such we grow as much vegetable and tree fruit as possible. No chemicals. Zero. It's all unprocessed. I'm also building a chicken coop. The hugest head When Alex was a young kid, he was always big. I went and sought medical advice for what we should do and a GP from New Malden took one look at Alex and said, \"The issue here is he's going to be a big kid\". When he was born, he had the hugest head. I can't explain how big his head was. His frame was going to be enormous. Before the hormones kick in, you have to have something on that frame, which at first is puppy fat. As the hormones come and the natural body process comes, that puppy fat turns into muscle. Dad, if you blow that whistle one more time I'm going to shove it up your backside What his doctor said at the time was to not put him on a diet and starve him of the nutrients he needs to grow. The best thing you can do is try to hold his weight constant and let him grow out of it. And that's exactly what we did. We always fed him correctly but we never put him on a diet. Alex’s bone structure has always been large. At 13 he was about 123 kilos, and really stood out on the rugby field. He weighed more in those days than he does now. For KCS Old Boys,­ one of his old schools,­ they used to call him 'Tank'. He always wanted to be a prop, but he wanted to be a prop who carried the ball. If you remember, in those days props didn't really touch the ball at the time. A couple of years later Alex was invited down to the Harlequins academy and the selector passed on him, because he said he was \"a prop and all he wants to do is carry the ball\". That was when Alex grew up. Training like Rocky He had two heroes at the time, who were Jonah Lomu and Andrew Sheridan. He wanted to run like Lomu and scrummage like Sheridan. We would take him on holiday and we'd make him run. After a while, probably when I was in my late 30s, my knees gave out. I was a big guy running on cement. Rugby mad: the young Alex When I was younger, I was faster than him, so I'd make him do interval training with me. He'd run 50 metres, walk 25, run 50 metres, walk 25, that kind of thing. When I couldn't run any more, I got my bicycle and I'd blow the whistle. We'd do that regularly and he'd fight me like any kid. One day he said, \"Dad, if you blow that whistle one more time I'm going to shove it up your backside.\" That was the end of his interval training. Alex has had more than a few surgeries and nursing him through and getting him back on the bandwagon is hard because you never want to see your kid hurting. You need to be there to support him to help him through the pain, the tears and the healing. But, at the end of the day, the one who's got to get back in condition and be fit enough to play is him.
