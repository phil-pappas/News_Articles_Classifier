The increase is seasonal and valid until 25 March 2016. A double-daily service will be operated every day except Wednesday by a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, offering customers 254 seats across its Business and Economy Classes. With the launch of these additional frequencies, customers from the Middle East, Asia Pacific and Africa in particular will benefit from improved connectivity to the Swedish capital via Qatar Airways' Doha hub. \nQatar Airways’ flight network to Scandinavia will be further enhanced with the expansion of flights to Copenhagen from 2 December 2015. The airline will increase frequencies from an 11-times weekly service to double daily flights, representing an increase of almost 30 per cent in additional seats to Copenhagen every week. All flights will be operated by a Boeing 787 Dreamliner and customers flying from the Middle East, Asia Pacific and Africa can look forward to even smoother connections via the state-of-the-art Hamad International Airport. \nOn 4 December 2015, five years after the introduction of the route, flights from Doha to Brussels will also be increased from seven to eight times weekly representing a 14 per cent increase in capacity on this route and enhanced connectivity for both leisure and corporate customers, particularly from the Middle East and the Indian Sub-Continent. \nQatar Airways Group Chief Executive, His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker, said: “We are delighted to offer our customers wishing to travel to and from Sweden, Denmark and Belgium an even greater choice of connection opportunities and this further network expansion is evidence of the growing demand on these routes. Qatar Airways continues to expand rapidly, not only in terms of our global network but also in terms of the service we offer our customers. Complementing our five-star service in the skies on board one of the youngest fleets in the industry are our transfer facilities at the state-of-the-art Hamad International Airport in Doha.” \nQatar Airways has seen rapid growth in just 18 years of operation and today flies a modern fleet of 166 aircraft to 152 key business and leisure destinations across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific, North America and South America.
