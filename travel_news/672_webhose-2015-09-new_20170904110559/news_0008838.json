Farrell revealed that England had such setbacks in mind when they decided to keep a 39-man squad ­together up until the final stages of World Cup selection, so that those who did not make the cut would be able to step in without missing a beat. Expect the unexpected, has been England’s mantra. “We could definitely cope and that is why your selection has to be right so that you can cover all ­bases,” Farrell said. “Players have been mixed into different positions for 11 weeks now in training camp so that we have all eventualities covered. “When the eight players left the squad [a fortnight ago], they were told that they need to make sure that they keep fully up to speed, not just physically, but mentally, too. “History shows that there will be injuries and that they will be ­needed. That is why we kept the 39 together as late as we could. We will be keeping in contact with them. We are 100 per cent happy that we have a squad that complements each other – and well balanced among the replacements, too.” England have not endured any withdrawals during their camp, although three players – full-back Ben Foden, flanker Tom Croft and scrum-half Joe Simpson – were effectively ruled out of immediate World Cup consideration due to various injuries over the past nine months. Two others, hooker Dylan Hartley and centre Manu Tuilagi, dashed their hopes through self-inflicted disciplinary issues. Farrell does not believe that Wales will be weakened by their own injury difficulties, although he expressed his sympathy for the full-back Leigh Halfpenny, with whom he worked on the British and Irish Lions tour to Australia two years ago. “Leigh is as good a kicker as there is in world rugby, whose attention to detail is second to none, but they have got a pretty good replacement in Dan Biggar, who is very confident at taking shots from anywhere,” he said. The England backs coach also has first-hand experience of Rhys Webb’s replacement, Mike Phillips. “It’s not a bad thing to have an ­angry Mike Phillips,” he said. “He will want to prove a point.” Farrell worked alongside Warren Gatland on that trip, and he insisted that the Wales head coach would use the seemingly parlous situation to his advantage. “Wales will not be down, believe me, and Warren will use this as a bit of a backs-against- the-wall mentality,” Farrell said. “That will strengthen them, galvanise them even more. We don’t see it as weakening them at all.” England do not expect Wales to vary their playing systems with the call-ups of two different types of player at scrum-half and at full-back, with Phillips a more abrasive figure and the likelihood that Liam Williams (already in the squad) moves to full-back. “Liam is a tricky character, strong for his size, wiry and evasive,” said Farrell, whose preparation will have extended to assessing those Welsh players England are likely to meet eight days after their World Cup opener against Fiji on Sept 18. “They will attack and defend the same, although one-on-one threats are a different thing and that is what various personalities bring to a team.” Gatland has been criticised in Wales for what was perceived to be taking a risk in playing two front-line players against Italy, but Farrell has nothing but understanding. “I have no doubt that the boys would have wanted to play,” he said. “Leigh would have put a lot of detail into his preparation over the 10 weeks or so in camp and he would have wanted to put it out there on the field in a match. Players can only do so much in training.” Telegraphsportpage Follow @telegraphsport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T04:37:07.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
