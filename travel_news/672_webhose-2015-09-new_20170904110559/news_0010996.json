Homer referred to the ‘liquid gold’ of olive oil; writers such as Athenaeus and Hippocrates described the way dishes were prepared and eaten. So strong is the culinary tradition that it has survived occupation by the Arabs (824-961), the Venetians (1204-1669) and the Ottomans (1669-1898). Rewarding place to start: The port of Chania Photo: Region of Crete Today, the international scientific community hail the \"miracle of the Cretan diet\" that gives its population a notably low occurrence of coronary disease and cancer. Food and wine thus form an integral aspect of life in Crete. Whether you observe olive picking, visit Cretan tavernas and farms or undertake a wine trail, you will relish a gastronomic passion gained over the centuries, all proffered with warm hospitality. The beautiful port of Chania is a rewarding place to start. Amble through the Old Town and the Venetian fortress and imbibe the atmosphere over pilaf rice, ofto (roast baby goat) and fresh salads. Abundant: olives nurtured under the Mediterranean sun Photo: Region of Crete The municipal market is a food-lovers’ paradise with its colourful array of specialist vendors purveying bread wreaths, graviera and anthotyro cheeses, and luxuriant staka butter – the final flourish in Cretan ‘wedding rice’ cooked in nutritious meaty broth. You will discover that restaurateurs across the island all serve a palate-pleasing local cuisine based on olive oil, herbs, cheese and fresh produce. Food and wine are an integral aspect of life in Crete Olives, nurtured under the Mediterranean sun and brushed by Aegean winds, are abundant and add earthy piquancy to bread, pies, meze, tomato-based sauces, stews and stuffings. Cheese lovers adore Crete. The annual per capita consumption of cheese in Greece is higher than in any other European country. Mouthwatering: Crete is a cheese-lover's paradise Photo: Region of Crete Cretan cheese, long considered the secret to the longevity of the islanders, is made solely from sheep or goat milk, or in combination. They come white and yellow, creamy and hard, fresh and mature, reflecting the landscapes on which the herds graze. Must-tries include graviera, which ranges from sweet to nutty, and Kefalograviera, used in moussaka and pastitsio. Fresh flavours: restaurateurs use local produce Photo: Crete Agronutritional Authority Crete is an important destination for wine appreciation. Not only do the indigenous varieties complement the local gastronomy, their production also embodies viticultural customs handed down from ancient times. Near Kato Zakros, archaeological finds attest to traditions dating back 4,000 years. The areas under vine lie in the north and are tended with artisanal reverence and sophisticated oenological techniques. Vines flourish, basking next to silvery olive groves and sheltered from the warm winds of the Libyan Sea. In the vineyards surrounding Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, winemakers are happy to share their insights into the celebrated whites – Vilana, Vidiano, Dafni, Thrapsathiri, Malvazia di Candia, Muscat of Spina, and Plyto. Good wine vibes on the grapevine Photo: Wines of Crete Aficionados of red wine should look out for Kotsifali, Martilari, Liatiko, Tsardana and Romeiko varieties.
