In July, prices were up 4.6pc from over a year ago, according to the Land Registry House Price Index. For investors, this could offer an exciting opportunity. But with mortgages becoming increasingly difficult to obtain, inflation pushing up running costs and a threat of rising interest rates, turning the dream into reality may be a step too far. And when it comes to central London, where prices have increased a huge 63pc since the pre-credit crunch high, bringing them to an average of £1.5m, many properties are simply off-limits. But there are financial instruments that take advantage of increasing house prices, without the cost and pressures of owning property directly. Here are some of the best. Closed-end property funds While there are only a handful of closed-end residential property funds, they are carving a place in a balanced investment portfolio. These funds are backed by solid assets and avoid the volatility of equities. The best operate as listed property companies investing in real estate opportunities and issuing shares to investors London Central Portfolio (LCP) has just launched its latest fund ­– London Central Apartments III (LCA III) – and is offering shares in a portfolio of 40 one- and two-bedroom apartments in an area designated by LCP as “Prime Central London”, which are rented out to blue-chip tenants. Prime Central London covers the boroughs of Kensington and Chelsea, and the City of Westminster. LCP is targeting a £100m fund-raise and will deploy this to buy, renovate and let further flats. It projects returns of 12pc per annum over five years and is currently open for subscriptions. LCP's latest Fund projects returns of 12pc per annum over five years and is currently open for subscriptions One big draw of this fund is that it is SIPP and ISA compliant and it has a minimum investment level of £25,000 (subject to eligibility). Also, following the summer Budget, corporation tax on rental income will be reduced while buy-to-let mortgage relief for higher-rate taxpayers is reined in. As a residential portfolio, let out on a commercial basis, LCA III falls outside the remit of the recently introduced Annual Tax for Enveloped Dwellings. The fund’s “genuine diversity of ownership” means it is also exempt from the capital gains tax and new inheritance tax charges that will be levied on non-resident and non-domiciled private property investors. The drawbacks of closed-end funds? Your money is tied to the performance of property, meaning it can go down if the market falls. The closed-end nature also means investors need a medium-term horizon (typically five to seven years) as money may be locked up for this period. Open-end property funds Open-end residential property funds offer more liquidity, with the option to buy and sell shares at any time. They are often a more appealing option for investors who need easy access to capital. TM Hearthstone’s UK Residential Property Fund is one such fund. It holds flats and houses for private rental around the UK and aims to match the growth of LSL Acadametrics’ house price index. Castel Fund in another option, targeting social housing and promising returns of 8pc a year. Open-ended residential property funds offer liquidity but you may not get the property exposure you anticipated However, investors should beware of the liquidity trap. Open-ended funds can hold back money to cover redemptions, so you may not get the property exposure anticipated. Some funds suspend redemptions when investors flood in to withdraw money, typically in a falling market, so savers are unable to access their capital. This has had disastrous consequences, epitomised by New Star UK Property Trust and more recently the Brandeaux funds, which invest in student accommodation. Tracker funds There is a simplicity to investing in funds that track familiar indices, with the added ability to quantify your own returns by looking up published reports. HouSA from Castle Trust is one option. It offers investors the opportunity to invest into a vehicle that tracks the Halifax House Price Index. There are three-year, five-year and 10-year options available with returns projected from 25pc, 50pc and 70pc respectively, above Halifax HPI. An income HouSA is also available and both options can be held in SIPPs and ISAs. Investors can redeem at any point before the end of the term and receive returns on a pro-rata basis. The downside is that it is tied to a fairly lack-lustre UK housing market. Shares in listed property developers Another route is buying shares in a listed developer. The fate of companies such as Taylor Wimpey or Barratt is tied to the housing market, meaning you get exposure without hassle. These equity investments offer a good proxy for house prices and developers’ shares have been performing particularly well recently, bolstered by the range of government incentives for house-building. However, like tracker funds, most of these companies have a nationwide focus, rather than targeting high-performing areas such as Prime Central London. They are also tied to the general domestic economy making them a more risky investment. There are other downsides. Investments are not asset-backed and factors outside market performance can jeopardise returns. This was thrown into sharp relief following the summer Budget on 8 July. When more cooling measures were loaded onto buy-to-let landlords, shareholders in companies such as Foxtons watched their investments plummet 4.7pc that day. • For more information on LCP’s one-stop service or investing in their new fund, London Central Apartments III, go to londoncentralportfolio.com or follow them on Twitter @LCP_Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T14:25:50.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
