The popular line of vehicles is capable of carrying passengers, packages, tools, equipment or materials, and SuperSprings 速 International can help users find the right rear suspension setup for any configuration. Easy-to-install SuperSprings and SumoSprings can be used individually or in tandem to enhance ride and reduce body roll.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150831/262383\n\"Our products are an ideal choice for Transit users who are looking for a better ride under load than is provided by the factory rear spring pack and bump stop,\" says Mike Visser , president of SuperSprings International. \"We offer a variety of SuperSprings and SumoSprings options and have a team of suspension experts ready to help customers find the best fit for their vehicles, because not every application requires the same suspension. Shuttle bus operators have different ride-related requirements than general contractors, for example. That's why it is important that any suspension improvements are tailored to each individual need.\"\nSumoSprings are \"airless airbag\" suspension enhancers that replace the Transit's factory bump stop. They are composed of microcellular urethane, which offers smooth compression under load. This makes SumoSprings the best option for improving ride comfort on vehicles configured for passenger transportation. SuperSprings International offers SumoSprings in three densities for light-, medium- and heavy-duty applications.\nFor Transit users who want to enhance their vehicles' load-supporting abilities, but may not carry passengers, SuperSprings International offers original SuperSprings. These self-adjusting leaf spring stabilizers fit over the factory spring pack, providing extra suspension support that reduces body roll and levels the rear of the vehicle. The shackles that hold SuperSprings to the Transit's factory spring pack feature two settings, so users can adjust the amount of tension as needed.\nSince SuperSprings take up little space above the factory spring pack, they can be used in conjunction with SumoSprings for maximum support and ride improvement. Both products can be installed in-house using standard tools, so there is no need to shuttle new vehicles back and forth from the spring shop.\n\"One of the biggest benefits of SuperSprings and SumoSprings is that you can install them yourself without having to remove the factory leaf springs,\" says Visser. \"This saves time, better uses resources and preserves the vehicle's original equipment. And since these are 'fit-it-and-forget-it' products, they can be left untouched for the life of the vehicle.\"\nTo find out which SuperSprings and SumoSprings options are right for your Transit, call (866) 898-0720.
