A Romanian group of 15 known as the, “queen of thieves” robbed tourists at top landmarks in Paris. Their plans included the security guard who was bribed for turning a blind eye even while the thieves picked money from tourist bags.\nThe men smartly mingled and behaved like normal tourists clicking selfies. They wore Bermuda shorts and worked in groups of three with one stealing, the other causing distraction and the third keeping a look out. They robbed tourists of thousand of euros in places that receive the maximum visitations like the Palace of Versailles, the Orsay and Louvre museums and the Eiffel Tower. If they were caught they screamed and started fighting to such an extent that tourists were put off and they escaped easily.\nThe group fixed an accomplice in every landmark suspect the police. A guard at the Versailles accepted was bribed of €10,000 (£7,300) to look away. Theft cases in Paris have been remarkably high; in 2013 the staff in the Louvre went on strike owing to increasing pickpockets in the famous museum. They wanted police reinforcement to be sent. In 2012 Louvre registered 138 thefts and worth €138,000 (£100,000) stolen. Again from 2005 to 2013 with which this group has be associated stole around €700,000 (£510,000). These were well planned robberies with two women among the masterminds Mariana Gandac, 25, alias Cinca, and Sandra Baciu, 35, dubbed “the Queen of Thieves”.\nIt is much like a movie where a couple who have been accused met while picking from the same handbag. The group hated public holidays as those brought more Parisians to the museums and they were of no interest to the gang. This is the second time in four months after eight Romanian pickpockets who adopted the same way of robbing from clueless tourists were arrested.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T12:47:35.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
