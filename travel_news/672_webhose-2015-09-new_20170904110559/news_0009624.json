The police chief has said that he was taking revenge for his comrades and this was not part of an international terrorist plot, The Guardian reported. \nBomb-making materials were found in the apartment where Karadag was arrested. These included ball-bearings similar to those from the Erawan bombing, the Bangkok Post reported. The materials also included detonators, a metal pipe meant to be used as another bomb, and passports, The Guardian reported. \nPolice are saying that Karadag is not the man in the yellow shirt seen in original photos of the bombing. That photo showed a man in a yellow shirt and beige shorts sitting in front of two police officers, his hands in handcuffs. He had a beard and light brown hair. Police believe others were involved in the bombing who haven’t been caught yet, perhaps as many as 10 people, The Bangkok Post reported. \nKaradag had an international passport being passed around now on social media that many are saying look fake. The capital “Istanbul” is incorrectly spelled in Turkish and police have confirmed the passport is fake, the Bangkok Post reported. \nThe second arrested person was Yusufu Mieraili. \n“In the passport, he is named Yusufu Mieraili, 25, from Xinjiang. The province is home to China’s Uighur Muslim minority, hundreds of whom have been detained and deported by Thailand after attempting to seek asylum there.” This suggests that the attack was more revenge, as per the Qur’an: “And We ordained for them therein a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and for wounds is legal retribution.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T11:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T12:13:24.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
