Send us your feedback for the chance to win a £250 voucher to be used with Railbookers The Dom Luis I Bridge in Porto Photo: Getty Images 6:26PM BST 04 Sep 2015 Comments \nThis week's winner: Porto by train \nOnly trains allow us to assimilate places. Land by jet in a new country and you have missed all the subtle transitions that happen between places. \nWe were travelling through Spain and Portugal, from La Coruña on Spain’s north coast, via Santiago de Compostela (though our pilgrimage was by rail not foot), on to Pontevedra and Vigo (a big, dirty city you would never think of flying into but the train took us there and we loved it). \nNow we were crossing the border into Portugal. We knew we had done so because the stations were tiled and everything looked just that little bit more ramshackle. Night was gathering, giving rise to a question: why do ribbons of cloud materialise just above the horizon at sunset? You seldom, even here on the western edge of Europe, see the big orange sun sizzle into the sea. \nThe night was winning as our train trundled south, the taste of diesel sour in our mouths. The day put up a last struggle, the western sky flushed pink, making silhouettes of trees. Street lights and car headlamps were beginning to announce Porto ’s approach. Day done. \nTony Chapman wins a £250 railbookers voucher \nMore feedback from readers \nGenoa and the Ligurian coast \nI agree with Julia Buckley (“ Weekend in Genoa ”) that this Italian city is, indeed, a fascinating, atmospheric, must-see place – and if you love Italy and want to visit interesting corners without hiring a car, it’s also an excellent starting point for exploring the beautiful Ligurian coast by road and rail. \nWestward, between Genoa and the French border, are the sandy beaches of Riviera di Ponente. You could stay at any of the pretty little fishing villages accessible by train or in grand San Remo, which surprisingly boasts a very interesting old town, with kasbah-like arched passageways, called the Pigna. \nEastward lies the rugged Riviera di Levante, with its multicoloured trompe-l’oeil houses. Base yourself in the pretty town of Santa Margherita, a short boat ride from expensive but unforgettable Portofino. Within easy reach by bus is also the attractive fishing village of Camogli, famous for its Sagra del Pesce (Fish Festival) held every second Sunday in May. \nUnmissable, too, is an excursion to the Cinque Terre, the five villages of Monterosso. Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola and Riomaggiore, linked by lovely walks, where houses appear to cascade to the sea. \nSue Holmes \nThe Liguria coast Photo: Fotolia/AP \nNizams fit for a princess \nFurther to William Dalrymple’s lyrical account of his experiences in Hyderabad (“ An Indian affair ”), I’d like to observe that when it came to the time for the marriage of the daughters of the last Ottoman Caliph, he looked not to the Shah of Iran nor the King of Egypt, but rather to the sons of the Nizam of Hyderabad. One could argue that an Imperial Princess of the Ottoman Empire should have married an equal, but such was the prestige (and wealth) of the Nizams. \nComment posted online \nPeloponnese pleasures \nWe had an unforgettable three-week holiday in our motorhome in the Peloponnese and, like Harry Mount (“ Ancient glories, modern pleasures ”), we headed for the Mani Peninsula. We took the ferry from Venice to Patras and followed the clockwise route intending to visit Olympia first and saving Epidaurus and Corinth until last. \nBeing early season (May/June) many campsites and tavernas were closed and there were few tourists. It meant we saw authentic Greece and Greeks living their everyday lives. \nWe visited all 10 of Harry’s “highlights” and covered all the “fingers” of the Peloponnese. He missed out Methoni, an ancient Venetian port, Marmari (my favourite) at the end of the Mani – the most southerly tip of Europe – and Monemvasia “old” town. \nThe roads east cover mountainous terrain but lead to spectacular places. I’ll never forget the peaceful village of Arhangelos where the shepherdess passed every day leading her flock, and Leonidio, a high mountain retreat, and Karathomias by the sea. \nPatricia Webster \nThe landscape of the Mani Peninsula in Greece Photo: Fotolia/AP \nIs Conwy the best town in Wales? \nFurther to the letter from A Allen ( Travel views ) and the above question, the answer is undoubtedly Yes! There is so much to see and do within Conwy’s medieval town walls, there are wonderful views, good places to eat and drink, and great shops. Check out Telford’s Suspension Bridge and the Albion Alehouse, and don’t miss the 700-year-old Conwy Honey Fair on September 14. \nPeter McFadden (online comment) \nPermission to enter Canada \nI was amused to read in Travel News (August 29) that from March 15 next year we must apply online for an Electronic Travel Authorisation to enter Canada. When my father fetched up at Quebec, aged 17 in 1930, among a party of youthful emigrants, all they had to provide was a British birth certificate. \nLess than 50 years ago, in 1966, he and my mother emigrated, in their 50s, without any job but with a £100 ex-British Army ambulance kitted out as a camper van, which took them across the country several times to a job as janitor/curator of Banff museum, opposite the ski slopes of the Rockies. \nNext year I followed, with £100 in my pocket and with no job, though I soon managed to find work as a gardener-cum-waiter in the Canadian National Railways hotel in the Rockies, Jasper Park Lodge. I earned more than I had as a journalist on Fleet Street, enough to soon go to San Francisco in the Summer of Love. \nDid it really happen – or did I dream it?! \nRichard Lennox \nConyw Castle Photo: Fotolia/AP \nWin a £250 rail voucher \nTelegraph Travel readers have the chance to win £250 worth of gift vouchers courtesy of Railbookers, a specialist company that can arrange inspirational rail journeys in scenic settings across the world, combined with flights, overnight stays in hand-picked hotels and exciting excursions. \nWhy not head out on a European grand tour by rail?
