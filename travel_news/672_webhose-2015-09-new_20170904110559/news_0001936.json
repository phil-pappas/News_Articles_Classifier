Riding on the Taste Bud Tour, we had visited 10 Swan Valley’s most delightful tasting experiences in just half a day. We practically completed our shopping list of the Australia’s must-buy products within this tour, which was fabulously conveniently and there is no better way to taste such a spread so easily! \nTop left to right: Yahava Koffeeworks, Cape Lavender Bottom left to right: Windara Honey, Mago Coffee \nLeft: Windy Creek, Oggies Ice Cream Cafe, Maalinup Aboriginal gallery \nMondo Nougat, Whistler’s Chocolate Company, Morish Nuts \nOur next stop was Caversham Wildlife Park Experience, where we were quite thankful to walk off some calories after speed grazing. Situated at Whiteman Park, it houses one of the largest collections of native fauna in West Australia. We got up close with Australia’s irresistibly adorable native animals – Kangaroos, Koalas, Wombats and many more. I recommend this as a fun and educational place of interest for the whole family – the kids will love it! \nCatch a mummy and her joey, awww cute! \nMeet wombat and friends \nThe sleepy koala \nOne of the highlights of this trip was the opportunity to attend the Singapore Airlines Swan Valley Annual Wine Show Awards 2015. We were pleased to attend the black tie event at the function centre in Mandoon Estate Winey, to celebrate the region’s finest winery establishments each year. Particularly, Chenin Blanc and Swan Valley Shiraz with the fortified wines were commended by one of the judges to be of world standards, so don’t miss to taste them when you are there. \nWe were all dressed up for the event! \nSumptuous gala dinner of roast lamb rump, pairing with the best wines. \nCongratulation to all winners of the night, especially Talijancich Winery, which was awarded the Singapore Airlines Trophy for the Best Wine of Show with the Talijancich Pedro Ximenes Liqueur 2007. \nWhat an eventful night! More to come on next, follow me on my Day 3 in Swan Valley! \nTaste Bud Tours – Good Food Wine and Wildlife Tour Contact: Loris Gundry / 0412 244 201 www.tastebudtours.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T17:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T06:20:54.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
