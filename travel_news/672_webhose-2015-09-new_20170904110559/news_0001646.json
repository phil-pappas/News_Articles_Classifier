Share this article Share 163 shares It was with great anticipation that I arrived at the seaside hotel (think lots of pure white furnishings and soft shades of grey, all over-looking a deep blue sea out of every window.)\nWarmly welcomed by my LifeCo Hostess, she then proceeded to talk me through the varying programmes this famed detox retreat offers which includes everything from anti-ageing regimes to raw ketogenic eating.\nI was only interested in one set-up however, the Master Detox, which is the one Kate Moss does year in and year out when she needs a beauty and healing boost.\nThe crisp white and airy hammam in LifeCo Antalya is where the detox treatments take place\nOne of the spa treatment rooms that Kate Moss and her fashion cohorts like to enjoy\nA breakout area in the spa offers a serene panorama of the sea and mountains outside the window\nAnd make no mistake, the supermodel is a regular – by my count she's been at least seven times in the past few years.\nShe often takes BFF Naomi Campbell with her, along with a gaggle of her closest friends.\nThe programme she does each time is the Master Detox – a week without any solid food, giving your digestion a break and instead ingesting daily dose of healthy juices and added nutrients.\nKate Moss is known to undertake the Master Detox when she visits the spa. Pictured left the detailed tiles of the hammam\nThe calm and relaxing waiting area for guests undergoing beauty treatments and the beauty regime at the spa\nThe spa is beautiful – all overlooking the sea. And my hostess started me off with something apple and gingery in a martini glass which reassured me; I figured I was in the right place.\nAs things progressed, I discovered to my relief that all juices were delicious, and came in such frequent intervals that it kept me from feeling too keenly a stomach begging for burgers.\nKate is rumoured to also sip Turkish black tea by the pool in her black bikini during her detox breaks but the spa 'bartender' at The LifeCo Antalya wasn't having any of it when I asked for some myself.\nGuests can also enjoy a special menu packed with healthy juices at the Saf spa during their detox\nA hot stone massage treatment (left) and the spacious sauna area at LifeCo Antalya\nThe programme, created by celebrity nutritionist Amanda Hamilton includes daily juices blended with bentonite clay, wheatgrass shots and a warm broth, that is surprisingly good.\nThere are also specialist supplements and inclusive support treatments that help keep you busy and help you stop thinking about eating all day – but also gently nudge the detox along.\nThe best one was the Rhythm Life Shot 200 – a coconut kefir drink I drank daily which gave me 200 billion of the 'good bacteria' that get destroyed by bad, sugar heavy diets.\nAs someone with occasional IBS, I can literally say I felt the difference immediately.\nThe healthy food options at the resort are made from fresh natural ingredients and have Turkish influences\nThe seating area in the Saf dining room is decorated with a wooden and zesty bright green aesthetic\nHamilton says that as of late detoxing has gotten a bad rap; one it doesn't deserve.\n'While it is certainly true that our bodies can detoxify themselves without a week long cleanse – the mistake people make is assuming that something like this doesn't help and support the natural detoxing process.\nGiving your digestion a rest and reboot, cleansing your colon, losing excess fluid retention or dropping a few pounds of excess weight, these are all good things.\nThe detoxes that we've created at the Life Co are all designed to help the body's natural processes and promote healing - it's just fast-forwarded by the process we use. And we've seen some very positive results over the decade we've been running programmes.'\nFresh vegetables are served up at each meal ensuring that guests don't feel deprived during their health kick\nGiving your digestion a rest and reboot, cleansing your colon, losing excess fluid retention or dropping a few pounds of excess weight, can all happen during a stay at The LifeCo\nThe treatments that go alongside the juices are extraordinary. I know of at least one top beauty editor who is already pin thin but regularly goes there for these alone.\nThere is Oxygen Therapy (inhaling pure Oxygen for 15 minutes a day), along with Ozone Saunas and blood treatements, Liver flushes, Sodium Inhalers, RedCord Pilates, an Inversion Table and Light therapy just to scratch the surface.\nWhat caught my attention almost immediately was the 'Angel of Water' colon cleansing. I'm not sure why they call this the angel because truth be told I had a devil of a time figuring out how to self-administer a colonic.\nIt's like riding a perverted bicycle. But if Kate does it – I assured myself, I can too.\nSport is encouraged too: The corridor between some of the rooms used for exercising\nVital ingredients to achieve optimal health and reach supermodel good looks\nOrganisers assured me that unless my digestion was working optimally, the rest of me would not be – and all the probiotics I was taking would help me get a great clear out.\nIndeed. For those that are super squeamish, rest assured, there's a resident doctor and nurse on standby.\nI'm reliably assured that Kate is also fan of the Cryo Cabin Cold Treatment – which boosts your metabolism and helps fight cellulite of which she has almost zero.\nIt's immersing yourself in a layer of nitrogen vapour at a temperature of -180 °C for a what feels like the longest three minutes in history.\nNo pain, no gain: The spa floor extends out to a gym area full of a range of equipment to choose from\nThe seating area outside the spa overlooks the water and mountains and is dotted with palm trees\nThe arctic blast coupled with the quick treatment is supposed to trigger healing and rejuvenating effects. I screamed so loudly I think they heard me in Istanbul. However, I have to admit I felt amazing for hours afterwards.\nThere were also massages several times a day: head, abdominal (to help that digestion process even further) and lymphatic massage to aid detoxing. It was pure heaven.\nI dropped four kilos in the seven days I was there, had more energy than I'd had in months and my skin was completely glowing. I can see why Kate likes a top up now and again herself.\nTRAVEL FACTS Amanda Hamilton's detox at LifeCo Antalya at Akra Barut starts from £1800 with shorter and lower cost packages also available year round www.nourishholidays.com\nDIY Detox: The Life shot 200 five-day programme is available at www.rhythmhealth.co.uk or at select Planet Organic and Whole Foods stores.\nMonarch Airlines is the best way to get there and flies to Antalya with several flights a day at from several UK airports.
