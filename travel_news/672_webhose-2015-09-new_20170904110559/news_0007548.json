But an active Caribbean holiday could also involve hiking up a dormant volcano, cycling around Cuba or embarking on an adventurous tour of Haiti, which is re-emerging as a destination for intrepid travellers. \nUnless otherwise stated, package prices given in the following sections are per person for seven nights in low season, based on two people sharing the cheapest accommodation, and including direct economy flights and transfers. For direct bookings, rates given are for accommodation only, per night for the cheapest double room. 1. Kitesurfing and windsurfing, Dominican Republic \nIdeal wind conditions and reef-protected waters make laid-back and hip Cabarete, on the Dominican Republic’s north coast, one of the Caribbean’s best places for kitesurfing and windsurfing. The wind is most reliable in February/March and May-August. Booked through Sportif (01273 844919; sportif.travel ): from £1,169 including breakfast at the smart Velero Beach Resort, on the beach and next to a kitesurf/windsurf centre, plus £149 for a week’s equipment hire. Fred Mawer 2. Diving, Bonaire \nEveryone’s first scuba dive retains a special memory, so Curaçao in the Dutch Caribbean looms large and wondrous in my memory, the vibrant sea life reflecting the pastel-coloured Dutch colonial buildings of the island’s lively and cosmopolitan capital, Willemstad. However, nearby Bonaire also called, as it does to all devoted divers. It is known for its sloping drop-offs and brightly coloured corals. Peacock flounders change colour at you; sea fans wave on the current. And at night beware the 6ft barracuda sliding over your shoulder like a silver battleship. A trip with Regaldive (01353 659999; regal-diving.co.uk ) staying at Buddy Dive Resort ( buddydive.com ) costs from £1,329 B&B. James Henderson \n3. Sailing, British Virgin Islands \nThanks to protected waters, line-of-sight navigation and short hops between the archipelago’s 60 green islands, the BVI is as good as it gets in the Caribbean for a sailing holiday, especially for novices. Sunsail (020 3627 9652; sunsail.co.uk ) has a sailing school in Tortola. It offers yacht charters and flotilla holidays round the BVI: from £1,542 for a week’s flotilla, based on four sharing a yacht between November 2015 and May 2016, when conditions are best. Fred Mawer 4. Exploration, Haiti \nHaiti may still be recovering from the devastating 2010 earthquake. But it’s the Caribbean’s most extraordinary country, without a doubt. With its naïve art, magnificent gingerbread buildings, tap tap buses dressed like circus caravans, extraordinary history and, of course, voodoo, it is compelling like no other. Seven nights (one in Miami because of the flights) with Undiscovered Destinations (0191 296 2674; undiscovered-destinations.com ), visiting Port-au-Prince, Jacmel and flights up to the Citadelle, costs from £1,685, including a guide, entrance fees and some meals. Group departure only. James Henderson 5. Diving, Cayman Islands \nIt’s the vertical submarine walls that make diving the Cayman Islands so spectacular. They plummet down in to the deep blue as deep as 2,000ft. And Little Cayman’s Bloody Bay Wall is the most pristine there is – with corals as colourful as a stained glass window, lobsters wiggling their antennae at you and a grouper that lets you tickle his chin. Stay at the Southern Cross Club ( southerncrossclub.com ) on Little Cayman: with Original Diving (0207 978 0505; originaldiving.com ) from £2,900, full board, including diving package. James Henderson 6. Paddleboarding, Tobago \nPaddling though a phosphorescent lagoon is one of the Caribbean’s eeriest and most magical experiences. As you glide over the inky water, you leave a trail of ghostly green light, and each paddle stroke sets off glowing whorls and vortices. Millions of tiny organisms react with a pinprick of light. Flick a paddle for a cascade. Jump in and you’ll be swimming in a glowing cocoon. Stand Up Paddle Tobago ( standuppaddletobago.com ) will give you as quick lesson in paddle-boarding and take you out onto the Bon Accord lagoon. Booked through Just Tobago (01373 813234; justtobago.co.uk ) staying at the Toucan Inn ( toucan-inn.com ): costs from £855, including breakfast. James Henderson 7. Cycle tour, Cuba \nCuban Revolutions cycle tour reaches parts of Cuba most bike spokes don’t cover. It includes the most exciting road in Cuba – the southern coastal route west of Santiago de Cuba, where the road is straitjacketed between the Sierra Maestra mountains and the wild Caribbean. The tour combines colonial cities with rural idylls, and offers nights in casas particulares (private B&Bs). Booked through Skedaddle (0191 265 1110; skedaddle.co.uk ): from £1,865 for a 15-day trip including most meals but excluding flights; bike hire £150. Claire Boobbyer 8. Hiking & diving, St Eustatius \nCommonly known as “Statia”, this quiet and scenic Dutch island can only be reached by flying from St Maarten. Hiking and wreck diving are key attractions, along with the historic buildings in the capital, Oranjestad. I recommend the two-hour hike up the 1,968ft Quill, a dormant volcano. The entire coastline is a marine park, and many visitors are keen to find historic blue beads once used by traders and slaves working on the island. Stay at the 20-room Old Gin House (00 1 678 534 7125; oldginhouse.com ; from £146 with breakfast). Nigel Tisdall 9. Trekking on Dominica \nMountainous, covered in dense rainforest, with impressive waterfalls and a boiling lake accessed through the Valley of Desolation, Dominica is known as the Caribbean’s Nature Island. To get the best out of a visit, you need to pack hiking boots and employ a guide. KE Adventure Travel (017687 73966; keadventure.com ) runs 11-day, small-group trekking holidays taking in the most rewarding parts of the island, walking 4-8 hours a day, and staying in hotels and guesthouses: from £2,495 full board. Fred Mawer 10. Hike the Blue Mountain Peak, Jamaica \nThe Blue Mountain Peak above Kingston is Jamaica’s highest at 7402 feet and hikes generally leaves the lodges at around 3 am so that you arrive at the summit around dawn. The trail meanders through the inky tropical night - fireflies meandering in the forest – clambering over cols, crossing watersheds and clinging to hillsides. Human life is reduced to lines of tiny yellow streetlights far far below. As the dawn arrives the view opens across the whole eastern end of the island. Stay at Whitfield Hall (001 876 878 0514; whitfieldhall.com ; bunks at £13 per person, does not include food, take your own towel and toiletries).
