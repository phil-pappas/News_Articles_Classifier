It's no fun, and no one looks forward to it, but it's got to be done so that things are ready for the next baking or gardening season.\nSome fall garden tasks have to be done in order to help plants make it through the winter, said Jeff Griff, owner of Lowe's Greenhouses, Florist and Gift Shop i n Chagrin Falls. Some are things you should do right away, and others are tasks that should wait until later in the year.\nHere is Griff's checklist of 10 easy ways to winter-proof your yard.\n1. Feed your lawn in October or November. Continue to cut your lawn as long as it keeps growing, and lower the blades to discourage snow mold in winter.\n2. Clean leaves and debris out of perennial beds, or it will be much harder to do it in spring. Apply fresh mulch now.\n3. Pamper your roses to help them survive winter. Trim off only the tallest stems in fall and leave additional pruning for spring. \"The canes die from the top down, so it is important to save the energy stored in these leaves,\" Griff said.\n4. Don't trim climbing roses. Carefully remove the stems off their trellis, lay the stems on the ground and cover with mulch. Cover roses with a layer of mulch after the ground freezes.\n5. Water shrubs and perennials in late fall if the weather has been dry. Thirsty shrubs are likely to die over the winter.\n6. Voles like to spend the winter underneath low evergreens and feeding on the roots and stems, so place poison under the evergreens.\n7. In areas where high winds, salt spray from passing cars or hot sun damages plants, use an anti-desiccant spray or burlap screens for protection.\n8. Take extra care with newly planted evergreens, shrubs, trees and perennials. Mulch them after the ground freezes to eliminate frost heaving that can expose new roots to freezing weather. Use trunk wraps or collars to protect small trees from buck rubbing and deer browsing.\n9. Don't prune or fertilize trees or shrubs in fall. Wait until after Thanksgiving to fertilize trees and shrubs.\n10. Clean out vegetable gardens, and add compost that can break down over the winter. Till the soil now so you can plant spring crops right away. It's considered good luck to plant peas on St. Patrick's Day, Griff said.\nBonus tip: Bring large pots and garden statues inside, remove hoses from outdoor spigots, take pumps out of ponds and fountains, and drain irrigation hoses.\nHere are some helpful links:\n Grass Seed USA\n Preparing your garden for winter, from Better Homes and Gardens and HGTV.", "external_links": ["http://www.bhg.com/gardening/yard/garden-care/preparing-your-garden-for-winter/", "http://lowesgreenhouse.com/", "http://www.hgtvgardens.com/fall-gardening/prepare-your-garden-for-fall"], "published": "2015-09-22T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T01:55:44.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
