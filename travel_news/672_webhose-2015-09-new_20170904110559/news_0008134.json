Gaudí’s imaginative efforts were complemented by the decorative work of the artisans who collaborated with him between 1904 and 1906. A simple glance at the building gives rise to myriad interpretations. The discs of multi coloured glazed-ceramics and broken shards of stained glass placed with precision on the building’s facade and interiors depict flowers and water lilies and play with the reflections of the sunlight. The effect is to create a vast Impressionist painting that is often seen as the rolling sea in the heart of Passeig de Gràcia.\nPrado Museum\nThe building housing the Museo Nacional del Prado was designed by architect, Juan de Villanueva, in 1785. Originally named the Royal Museum of Paintings and Sculptures it was conceived by King Ferdinand VII encouraged by his wife, Queen Maria Isabel de Braganza.Quickly renamed the National Museum of Paintings and Sculptures it was subsequently rebranded the Museo Nacional del Prado, and opened to the public for the first time in November 1819.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T18:12:57.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
