It's a pleasure to drive in Germany--if you pay attention and blend in by driving on the right and passing on the left. \nThe best day to drive the autobahn is Sunday, when trucks are prohibited. \nIf you are coming up to the tail of a back-up, it is customary to switch on your hazard blinkers to warn cars behind you that they will have to slow down.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T14:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T06:38:28.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
