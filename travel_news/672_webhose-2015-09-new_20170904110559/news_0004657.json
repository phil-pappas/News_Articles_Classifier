Inevitably they grew up, inked the mortgage and welcomed the children to the family. And stopped going to festivals.\nThe majority of those who moshed to Nirvana and sweated up a storm to the Chemical Brothers diverted their entertainment dollar to more family friendly outings.\n19 WAYS YOU WERE A TEEN OF THE NINETIES\nSide shows rather than an all-day and night festival became their preferred haunt, leaving the cops-and-dogs greeting party and marauding hordes of overexcited young people to well, the young people. As it should be.\nGeneration X are now at the top of the demographic wishlist of the festival market as more boutique and niche events spring up to cater for the original alternative music fans.\nThe national festival calendar has undergone a drastic downsize in recent years with several of the enduring events calling it a day and canny promoters, who also happen to be of a certain age, are creating smaller events tailored for the music fan who might be sporting some salt and pepper at the temples.\nGreen location ... the historic Berry Showgrounds with plenty of space and shade will host the Fairgrounds festival. Picture: Supplied. Source: Supplied\nWelcome Fairgrounds Festival , Out On The Weekend and Vanfest among others including Gentlemen Of The Road , Small World Festival and the more established Bluesfest , Laneway and A Day On The Green gigs.\nThe reboot of the boutique festival focuses on the experiential elements which will appeal to an older audience. The location has to be somewhere different with a lot of greenery. The food and beverage offerings must be more than a bucket of chips, slice of pizza and mid-strength beer. Capacity should be comfortable and queues minimal. And you shouldn’t need four wheel drive capabilities on the pram.\nFairgrounds Festival takes the family-friendly element further than anything else on offer on this year’s weekend calendar.\nThe inaugural event will be held at the historic Berry Showgrounds on the NSW South Coast with an eclectic line-up which includes headliner Father John Misty, C.W. Stoneking, Jessica Pratt, Mercury Rev, RATATAT, Royal Headache and Unknown Mortal Orchestra.\nCurated by Handsome Tours after a two-year hunt for the right location, Fairgrounds is tailor made for the older music fan.\nMusic discovery ... Father John Misty will find new fans at Fairgrounds. Picture: Supplied. Source: Supplied\nThere is no VIP area because everyone gets the VIP treatment. If you want to bring a rug or deckchair you can; just don’t expect to plant them in the moshpit because there will be moshing.\n“There is no festival in Australia like this. It is for a demographic that is starved of an outdoor music experience,” promoter Colin Daniels says.\n“The primary motivation behind this is us, the festival we want to go to with our friends instead of being surrounded by drunk 18-year-olds with their shirts off. You will be treated like an adult.”\nDaniels and his mates, like most humans of a certain age, do not want to queue for the bars or the toilets, with or without their kids.\nIn fact, they may want to enjoy a set or two without their vintage rock T-shirt wearing offspring.\nSo the little ones will be catered for with a festival inside the festival.\n“We will have everything from a planetarium and a hay bale maze and there will be childcare so if you want to drop off your little ones to go see Royal Headache, you can,” Daniels says.\n“We want them to enjoy their own festival experience.”\nAnd for the adults who want a bit of playtime which isn’t related to music, you will be able to play boules, badminton, croquet and Twister or compete in the sack and egg and spoon races.\nFairgrounds Festival, December 5, Berry Showgrounds, from $120, children under 12 free, moshtix.com.au\nAmericana vibe ...

Open your ears, minds and hearts to quality. We won’t let you down,” BT proclaims. And there will be luxury coaches with entertainment during the ride Newtown and the CBD to make the journey to the event part of the ride.\nGo West ...
