Photo: Virginia Star\nWhat's new? Spark New Zealand, the dual-listed telecommunications company, once known as Telecom New Zealand, is one of that country's largest listed companies.\nTo get more Money more often, why not follow us on Twitter? We’re @FairfaxMoney\nGiven the selling in Spark's share price for much of the year, it would have been reasonable to assume that the telco's result last week was going to be a poor one.\nAdvertisement In the end the company not only surpassed earnings growth expectations, but management also delivered an increase in the dividend for this year, upped the forecast payout for 2016 and put a special dividend on the table.\nManagement's confidence has come from the company executing on several levels as shown on the results scorecard below. Spark delivered a gain in underlying earnings for the first time in a few years, saw strong growth in mobile and IT revenues, and upped its overall market share in mobile.\nFat Prophets sees initiatives in digital setting the platform for future sustained earnings growth.\nUnderlying cash flows were also strong, and were boosted by sales of non-core assets amounting to $NZ169 million ($A153 million) last year. These have left Spark more focused on its core kiwi market, and have helped to support a $NZ100- million share buyback program.\nThe past 12 months to 18 months have seen a lot of changes at the company with a major rebranding. However, this is already starting to yield significant benefits at the top and bottom lines.\nWhile continuing operating revenues were down 2.9 per cent to $NZ3531 million, a return to growth is close at hand. Gains in mobile and IT services are very near to swallowing up the attrition seen in fixed-line revenues.\nLast year also saw Spark continue to reap the rewards of a significant cost-out program. Expenses from continuing operations fell 5.0 per cent to $NZ2566 million. As a result, the company is as lean as it has been for some time.\nAt the bottom line, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) from continuing operations rose 2.8 per cent for the full year. Net earnings after tax from continuing operations for FY15 were more robust, up 16.1 per cent to $NZ375 million.\nA return to earnings growth and a divestment program has led to the rewards being shared with investors. Management declared a full year dividend of 20 cents, and upped it 2016 dividend forecast by 25 per cent to include an ordinary dividend of 22 cents per share and a special divvy of 3¢ a share. This put the shares on an 8 per cent yield at current levels.\nOutlook With Spark's revenue projections having been re-based following the FY15 results, management has outlined its expectations for modest growth in each of the next three years.\nIn particular, Fat Prophets notes that gains are being targeted in data and mobile, with a bigger slice coming from the likes of on-demand video (Lightbox) and cloud services. Furthermore, we thought it was interesting that management has not ruled out bolt-on acquisitions in their sphere of focus.\nPrice Spark is trading on a forward earnings multiple of 16.1 times, and offering a 7.5 per cent yield. Fat Prophets believes Spark's undemanding fundamental valuation metrics are consistent with the company's technical outlook, which has improved markedly over recent months.\nWith Spark's share price having recently gapped up and broken through resistance at $A2.87 in the process, we look for a decisive move above the long-term 200-day moving average as the catalyst for a new leg up in the company's share price.\nWorth buying? To Quote: Hannibal Smith from the A-Team: \"You have to love it when a plan comes together\" and it looks to be doing so for Spark, and despite many a doubter. Two years ago management set forth on a path to transform the company in two phases. The first involved stabilising revenue and margins, and reducing costs in FY14/FY15. It is fair to say this box has been ticked in Fat Prophets' view.\nThe second stage is to drive market revenue and margin growth while continuing to improve unit costs. Given the operational momentum that the company has on a variety of fronts, and the recent proven ability of management to execute, we are also backing this outcome.\nFor these reasons, Fat Prophets believes that the market is yet to allow for the earnings uplifts that are coming through to Spark in the coming years, and view the forward earnings multiple of 15 times as undemanding and 8 per cent yield as highly appealing, particularly given the low cash rate environment.\nGreg Smith is the head of research at Fat Prophets sharemarket research.
