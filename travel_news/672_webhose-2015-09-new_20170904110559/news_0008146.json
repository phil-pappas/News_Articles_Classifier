The award is presented by ASIS International, the leading organization for security professionals worldwide, at the ASIS International 61st Annual Seminar and Exhibits (ASIS 2015) , being held Sept. 28 to Oct. 1 in Anaheim, California .\nThe ASIS Accolades award recognizes the security industry's most innovative new products, services, and solutions.\nObject Origin provides security command centers with greater understanding of the risks with which they contend on a daily basis, enhances safety, and prevents costly service delays. With one click, a video replay can reveal the moment an unattended bag was left behind or a suspicious vehicle was parked, and identify the individuals to last have that object in their possession. In conjunction with Qognify Suspect Search, Object Origin can significantly expedite the search for those persons of interest.\n\"To have been named an ASIS Accolades Award winner for the second year in a row affirms Qognify's innovation and market leadership,\" said Moti Shabtai , President of Qognify. \"In high-traffic environments, unattended bags, suspicious objects, or unauthorized vehicles can cause critical and costly disruptions. Object Origin enables our customers to more quickly and safely resolve these situations, helping them to mitigate risk, streamline operations, and maintain business continuity.\"\nQognify will showcase Object Origin for the first time at ASIS 2015 at booth #601. The company will also present its entire portfolio of physical security solutions acquired from NICE Systems earlier this year. This includes NiceVision for video management; the award-winning Suspect Search and other video analytics tools; and Situator, a leading physical security information management (PSIM) and situation management solution.\nIn addition, Qognify's Senior Director, Global Training and Knowledge Dr. Bob Banerjee will participate in three educational panels:\nBecome a Proactive Security Organization : Monday, Sept. 28 from 4:30 p.m. - 5:30 p.m. Getting the Most From Your Global Operations Center : Tuesday, Sept. 29 from 4:30 p.m. - 5:30 p.m. The Great PSIM Debate : Wednesday, Sept. 30 from 1:45 p.m. - 2:45 p.m.\nQognify is an independent company set off from NICE Systems Physical Security Business Unit following its acquisition by Battery Ventures, a global technology investment firm.\nAbout Qognify\nQognify solutions help organizations capture, analyze, and leverage big data to anticipate, manage, and mitigate security and safety risks, maintain business continuity, and streamline operations.
