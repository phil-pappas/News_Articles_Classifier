The Appointment Group Training Academy was founded with a multi-dimensional approach in mind. Its main mission is to educate and offer professional training to young individuals aiming to become expert Travel Executives. \nIts other objectives are to offer training programmes to maintain our staff at the very highest level possible with supplier product training, sector specific seminars and the like. TAG worked with 12 of its trusted suppliers to design a varied programme including product experiential days, classroom and online training. Upon completion of the 52 week course the class will graduate and will be able to take the next step in their career as fully trained Travel Executives. This project is managed by Lesley Adams, Company Trainer at The Appointment Group. Lesley has over 30 years’ experience in leading and managing strategic and operational capability development interventions such as learning, training, development and coaching. John Gianquitto comments: “The Appointment group is extremely proud and excited about the opening of the TAG training Academy. The opportunity to recruit and train young talent in-house is a fantastic prospect for us and hopefully them! The academy will truly allow us to shape these talented individuals into expert Travel Executives who fully understand the TAG ‘way’ and ‘ethos’. We wish all our students of the academy all the best of luck and hope to offer them a long standing career in one of our offices around the globe.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T11:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:49:34.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
