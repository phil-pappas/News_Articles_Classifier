Users who forgot their passwords can call 2539-4000 and ask for assistance in Spanish.\nATV will ask users to register a cellphone number and email address. This information will be used to notify taxpayers about the completion of procedures in the system, but the platform will not be available for mobile devices.\nTax Administration Director Carlos Vargas Durán said the system adds improved security features over the software version, and “users can have complete confidence that their information will not be accessed or stolen by unauthorized persons.”\nIn its first stage, the ATV will be used for filing income taxes, sales taxes and solidarity taxes.\nThe older EDDI-7 system will remain active temporarily for administrative procedures including the processing of tax payment forms (D.110), payment of fines for administrative violations (D.116), payment of property transfer taxes (D.120) and filing of tax returns for the transfer of vehicles, aircraft and watercraft (D.121).\nTaxpayers who do not have access to a computer with an Internet connection can use computers with public access at the Tax Administration’s branches in all provinces, as well as public libraries, intelligent community centers and kiosks that will be available at the University of Costa Rica and the National Technical University.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T18:25:39.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
