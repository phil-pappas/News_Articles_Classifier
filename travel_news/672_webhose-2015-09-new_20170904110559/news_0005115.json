Hotel bookings can also be entered into the mobile device calendar directly. \nThe app is available for iOS and Android smart devices. After downloading \"Hotel Search HRS\" in the respective app stores, travellers can send a link to their smartphone via the company-specific Corporate Booking Portal to confirm the imported corporate settings. \nHRS CEO Tobias Ragge \"Mobile channels are a great help, especially on business trips, because last-minute changes to the schedule often call for new travel planning to take place,\" explains Tobias Ragge, CEO of HRS. \n\"With the HRS Corporate App featuring pre-stored information and specific corporate rates of importance for the business traveller, we make mobile bookings a lot easier for our customers.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T20:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T03:25:58.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
