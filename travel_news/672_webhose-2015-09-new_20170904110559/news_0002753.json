According to Save The Rhino organisation, 749 cases of rhino poaching have been recorded in the first eight months of 2015, creeping dangerously close to 1 215 (thats one every eight hours) poachings of 2014. The numbers have been steadily climbing since 2007.

World Wildlife Fund South Africa (WWF SA)started World Rhino Day began in 2010 and awareness of the animal endangered status has grown into an international success, uniting NGOs, zoos, cause-related organisations, corporations, businesses, celebrities and concerned individuals from around the globe, all doing their part to save the rhino. WWF SA has been involved in rhino conservation on the continent since the 1960s and has made critical gains in changing perceptions and raising awareness. Yet rhinos still continue to be poached at unprecedented rates. While WWF SA said in a press release that there is no single solution to the poaching scourge and that it would have to work strategically to combat rhino poaching and operate on numerous fronts. \"A key part of our approach is to work collaboratively with rural communities living near game reserves and to provide people there with the skills to manage their natural resources  including rhinos. In return, they reap the benefits of wildlife tourism while continuing to be custodians of rhinos for future generations.\" Give our rhinos a lift!

Sudan is 42 years old and is under 24-hour ranger guard in the reserve to protect him from poachers. The last three rhinos in the area had been poached in the last two years.

He is named Sudan and he is 42 years old. pic.twitter.com/qKh4J1bVhP  Kenyan Facts (@KResearcher) September 13, 2015 SA Youth plead the rhino's case in Vietnam To celebrate World Rhino Day, the KwaZulu Natal Project Rhino organisation is sending five young South Africans to Vietnam in the next month  armed with the World Youth Wildlife Declaration against rhino poaching  to plead the rhino's case and change Vietnamese perceptions. Vietnam, along with China, is regarded as the epicentre of rhino horn trade, and feeling is that a change of thinking here would have a significant impact on the trade and use of rhino horn in the region. On the eve of World Rhino Day, KZN Project Rhino's Sheelagh Antrobus told Zongile Mthimkhulu of East Coast Radio that the trip is significant for the youth involved and for rhino conservation. \"[These] young South Africans are speaking out against the decimation of one of our iconic wildlife species speaking directly to the consumers [in Vietnam] and to government officials [to] show them that as a South African youth generation they're not tolerant of this loss of something that they see very important, as part of their heritage and their culture.\" #LetOurVoicesBeHeardWe are thrilled to share this video today to celebrate #WorldRhinoDay with you! It is a tribute...Posted by Project Rhino KZN on Mon day, September 21, 2015 Jackie Chan, Mark Boucher, Angelina Jolie celebrate #WorldRhinoDay Meanwhile, the good fight continues around the world this World Rhino Day, with millions taking to social media to spread the word and do their bit for rhino conservation.
