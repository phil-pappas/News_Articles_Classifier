This recognition underlines the first-class leisure facilities on offer outside of our renowned golf heritage and to know that we are the leading resort in the country is a great feeling and something we are very proud of!”\nSet against the backdrop of 550 acres of North Warwickshire countryside, yet still just 20 minutes outside of Birmingham City Centre, The Belfry Hotel & Resort first made its name in golf as the world’s only four-time Ryder Cup host venue. The last few years however has seen the resort become just as well known for its world class leisure facilities than it is for its three iconic courses and golf academy.\nThe Belfry boasts 319 signature rooms that include 15 suites, its world-class Leisure Club and spa echoes the grand décor of the hotel with a wide variety of treatments provided throughout 11 luxurious treatment rooms, which can be complemented by their unique Fire & Ice experience through 12 bio-thermal rooms.\nExquisite dining is also a staple of The Belfry, with gastronomic excellence on offer at their signature restaurant; The Ryder Grill, where diners can view The Belfry’s chefs preparing their meal from the showcase grill and a variety of bars and onsite nightclub ensure that guests are well entertained into the early hours.\nComplementing the leisure amenities is the resort’s event facilities, with more than 20 conference and event spaces accommodating up to 400 guests, making The Belfry an ideal location for tying the knot, ensuring a wedding day to remember.\nIn addition to these facilities across the board, David Edwards, Resort Director at The Belfry points to the importance of customer service that was no doubt instrumental in ensuring the resort claimed this prestigious title, as voted for by the public; “Our staff at The Belfry Hotel & Resort are committed to providing our guests with exceptional service and hospitality. I am very proud of all our staff who continue to strive for excellence and have helped us become the Leading Resort in the country.”\nThe Belfry Hotel & Resort will be hoping for even more glory at The World Golf Awards in November where they are up for England’s Best Golf Hotel and England’s Best Golf Course.\nSource:- HBAA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:13:13.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
