United notified customers via its Twitter page and on its United.com website. Some posters on the airline’s Twitter site said their mobile apps also were not working.\n“The new united.com is experiencing overwhelming demand,” according to the airline’s home page. “The new version of our site is currently unavailable, but we’ll bring it back as soon as possible.”\nUnited unveiled the beta version of its new website May 12, offering updated search, reservation and ticket purchasing features. The new site also showed more options for passengers to use in choosing flights, such as Wi-Fi availability and in-seat power, pricing during a 15-day flight window and details on available upgrades, the airline said at the time.\nUnited.com accommodates some 2,000 users per minute and books about $1 million in revenue per hour, the Chicago Tribune reported in a May story about the new site. The carrier has suffered a number of computer or related problems since the 2010 merger of United and Continental Airlines.\nComputer Fault\nIn July, a computer fault halted all U.S. departures at United Continental Holdings Inc., the world’s second-biggest airline, for about two hours. The carrier suffered a similar incident on June 2 when departures were stopped because of insufficient flight dispatch information.\nIn February 2014, the system that handles check-ins and other passenger services failed, disrupting travel for about three hours at United hubs including San Francisco, Washington and Chicago. The previous month, a malfunction stranded pilots and caused about 1,500 cancellations.\nUnited added extra precautions in 2012 after a computer breakdown caused one of its planes to take off about 20,000 pounds (9,100 kilograms) heavier than pilots believed, creating difficulties in getting the jetliner airborne. Three other computer glitches that year at United also ensnared thousands of travelers with tardy flights.\n--With assistance from Justin Bachman in New York.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Mary Schlangenstein in Dallas at maryc.s@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story: Edward Dufner at edufner@bloomberg.net Molly Schuetz, Bruce Rule\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:02:00.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
