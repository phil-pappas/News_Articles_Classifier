The start of services on the Borders Railway is a truly historic moment for Scotland, the UK and the world, bringing to back to life these regions that played such an integral role in the forming of many of Scotland’s now global industries.\n“Born in the Scottish Borders myself, and with family heavily involved in the textile industry, the commencement of services on this Railway is of particular poignancy to me. I have no doubt that the Borders Railway will be a success, not only as a tourism destination, but also as a catalyst for growth, investment and business.\n“From rolling hills to babbling streams, mining landscapes to historic abbeys, chapels, castles and treasures, VisitScotland is embarking on a national and international marketing and PR campaign to encoura ge visitors to experience all the Borders Railway has to offer and we cannot wait to s how the wor ld.”\nThe Borders Railway begins service on Saturday 5 September with a special ‘Golden Ticket’ Day.
