On Thursday, it fell to $2.44 a gallon, which is down almost $1 from last year.\nAs a result, Oil Price Information Service analyst Tom Kloza tells the AP, American drivers are expected to spend $1.6 billion less from today through Monday while driving more miles over the holiday weekend.\nBut the U.S. Travel Association reports that the country’s poor road and air travel infrastructure will keep 4.1 million potential travelers at home this weekend.\nAccording to a survey and analysis from the trade association, even among people who plan to travel this weekend, 8.7 percent will travel for fewer days and 9.1 percent will travel shorter distances due to concerns over road congestion and air-travel headaches.\nThe U.S. Travel Association argues that this problem will only worsen with future Labor Day weekends because Congress has been unable to pass bills regarding the nation’s highway and air travel systems.\nRoger Dow, the association’s president and chief executive, says:\n“Americans vote with their pocketbooks — and in this case, they’re voting against how Washington has handled our transportation policy. … The lack of a long-term strategy for our highways and air travel system has created the perception for many that they’re better off staying home.”\nConsidering how many travelers have planned shorter Labor Day weekend trips this year due to infrastructure concerns, the American economy will lose out on $1.7 billion, according to the U.S. Travel Association.\n© Flickr user 'JeepersMedia' Gas Pump, 6/2015, by Mike Mozart of TheToyChannel and JeepersMedia on YouTube #Gas #Pump Dow continues:\n“Our infrastructure problems go way beyond mere inconvenience — they’re causing economic harm, and we need a long-term vision for tackling them.”\nDo you plan to travel this weekend?
