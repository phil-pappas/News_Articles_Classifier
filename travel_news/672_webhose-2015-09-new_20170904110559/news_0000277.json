When he addressed the tour operators, Stephane Perard, the Area Manager for Emirates in Brazil, said that Emirates was happy to be working with the Seychelles Tourism Board to help generate more traffic to these mid-ocean islands via Dubai. “We believe that Emirates is an ideal partner for Seychelles and are thankful that Minister St.Ange is with us tonight. Who better than this Minister responsible for Tourism to be here tonight to speak about the Seychelles?” Stephane Perard of Emirates Brazil said. \nWhen he was invited to address the gathered tour operators, Alain St.Ange, the Seychelles Minister for Tourism and Culture, said that he believed Seychelles was now the new holiday destination for Brazilians. “This we know from the different meetings we have had since my arrival in Brazil. \n“But to make this become a reality, we need you, the outbound tour operators, to work with us and put packages with Seychelles as the add-on from Dubai as your favorite offer. I appealed to Emirates to relook at its airfare to Seychelles via Dubai, and tonight Stephane Perard of Emirates accepted to launch a new special offer to mark this Seychelles evening in Sao Paulo. \n“We heard your appeal for a more balanced fare, and tonight we are confirming a fare that will make flights to Seychelles more comparative to those of other destinations of our region. We now need your commitment and support to get increases in bookings for Seychelles,” Minister St.Ange said. \nAs pictures of the islands were screened in the restaurant, the Seychelles Minister sold Seychelles to the tour operators who had not yet visited Seychelles and said that he was hoping that by December a marked increase in visitor arrival numbers from Brazil would be recorded. Minister St.Ange thanked Emirates and the Brazilian tour operators for their support and said that he was committed to consolidate the working partnership that had now been launched. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
