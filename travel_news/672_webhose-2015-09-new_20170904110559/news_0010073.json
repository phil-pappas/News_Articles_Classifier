The fees would fund affordable housing.\nThe other is a resolution that would set the stage for the council to later enact a mandatory inclusionary-housing program requiring developers of residential projects to either designate 5 to 8 percent of a project’s units as affordable or pay a fee.\nBoth programs would be contingent on the council’s increasing allowable building sizes and heights across much of the city, though not in most of its single-family zones.\nThe council would need to approve the rezones separately, a process that would begin next year and continue into 2017, so the commercial linkage-fee program and mandatory inclusionary-housing program wouldn’t be fully implemented immediately.\nMurray calls the programs paired with the rezones his “grand bargain” — a compromise between affordable-housing advocates and developers that would produce 6,000 affordable units of the 20,000 the mayor wants in a decade.\nSome prominent Seattle developers who had threatened to sue the city over its plans to make them pay for affordable housing have for now agreed to hold their fire.\nSeattle’s inclusionary-housing program would fund units regulated to be affordable for households making 60 percent or less of the area median income — about $54,000 per year for a family of four.\nMarket-rate rents have reached monthly averages of $1,399 in Rainier Valley and $1,887 in Capitol Hill, according to officials.\nDuring a news conference with the mayor Tuesday, a hospital worker said he can’t afford to live near his job on First Hill. “Instead I have to be on the road for hours a day,” said the worker, Michael Scott.\nThe mayor stressed there will be neighborhood engagement as officials move ahead with the legislation.\nMurray said: “Over the next 18 months, the city will be holding meetings in all the areas where we’re proposing changes … I know that Seattle is ready to embrace big ideas, to achieve our shared goal of a city that is equitable, a city that is for all.”\nA Murray spokesman, Viet Shelton, said the meetings will include officials asking residents for help with the details of the rezones.\nThe council will hold two special public hearings on affordable housing this month.\nThe first, on Sept. 9, will cover all 65 recommendations Murray’s task force made in June. The second, on Sept. 30, will focus on the grand-bargain programs. Both are scheduled for 5:30 p.m. in the council’s City Hall chambers.\nDaniel Beekman: 206-464-2164 or dbeekman@seattletimes.com .
