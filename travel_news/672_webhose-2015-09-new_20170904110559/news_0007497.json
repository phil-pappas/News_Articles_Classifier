Xbox One On Xbox One, gamers will now be able to download and play Valiant Hearts: The Great War (normally $14.99) and The Walking Dead: The Complete First Season ($24.99.) The games will be available from October 16th to November 15th. Valiant Hearts is a really different little Ubisoft title, mixing 2.5D puzzling with a real sense of sadness over the horrors of WWII. The art style is really terrific, but this isn't a traditional war game. It's well worth your time, especially when you can download it for free.[youtubevid id=\"gp1R_7tiulU\"] The Walking Dead is an episodic story game that tasks players with making tough choices in limited amounts of time. It's more of an interactive movie than a traditional video game, but it's got a pretty intriguing story and provides a nice parallel universe to both the comics and the AMC TV show. Xbox 360 For stragglers, Xbox Live Gold members will get The Walking Dead: The Complete First Season and Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes. [youtubevid id=\"DntILfvx938\"] Ground Zeroes is the fairly short prequel to Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain . If the relative shortness of the game turned you off from buying it at release, the price-tag now should convince you to download. It's a tiny affair compared to The Phantom Pain but it's still top-notch gameplay. Not sure how it performs on Xbox 360 but it was lovely on PC.No word on the PlayStation Plus games for next month yet.[gallery2012]", "external_links": ["http://majornelson.com/2015/09/24/xbox-live-games-with-gold-for-october-2015/?linkId=17295839"], "published": "2015-09-25T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T20:41:38.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
