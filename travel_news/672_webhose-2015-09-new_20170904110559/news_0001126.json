MSC.307 (88) - (2010 FTP Code) Annex 1 Part 5 .\nIn addition, we deploy various techniques to save weight by making use of ultrathin glass. For instance, Glass Deco can now carry out thermal tempering on two and three millimeter thick glass - something that was previously only possible on glass with a thickness of four millimeters and over-. This allows direct weight savings of 50% without compromising on strength or appearance.\nThe popularity of glass in design has risen over the years, and so, therefore, has the need for more advanced techniques that compensate for the increased weight. Glass Deco has invented lightweight and even unbreakable glass which is suitable for the superyacht industry.\n\" Glass Deco has always excelled in realizing various projects involving glass. Experience and skills built up over decades are today used to produce high-end glass objects and sculptures which often form the centerpiece of a larger project , \" says Frans van Hapert C.E.O. of Glass Deco Corporation BV.\n\" I am happy that Glass Deco is capable to deliver this new lamination method starting fr o m today after years of developing and investing in this new high tech production technique.
