There are views of the San Juan Islands, Mount Baker and Twin Sisters Mountain. This moderate hike is a good alternative to crowded trails nearby, especially on busy weekends such as Labor Day. \nFacilities: About 20 parking spots and restroom available at the Blanchard Lower Trailhead. Most hikers park a mile further up at the Blanchard Upper Trailhead. The upper lot, with about 25 parking spots, doesn’t have restrooms. Vehicles with horse trailers should park in the upper parking lot, which is larger. No water fountains. \nThe hike: With 15 miles of trails and connectors on Blanchard Mountain, there are several routes to North Butte. Here’s an easy one. Most Read Stories Report gives Seattle drivers worst marks yet; Bellevue isn't far behind \nWe parked at the Blanchard Upper Trailhead and took Lizard Trail, which unlike the popular trailhead off Chuckanut Drive (at Milepost 11), is not steep. Walk over a pedestrian bridge with a small waterfall and zigzag on the flat trail for 3.5 miles to the Lily Max Connector. \nYou might see crowds here, but most are heading to Oyster Dome or to Samish Overlook. The crowds usually thin higher up. The trail has some slight inclines once you pick up Max’s Shortcut for 1.4 mile. This section, under a lush forest of firs and hemlocks, can be muddy and slippery in wet seasons. \nHead north to pick up Lily Lake trail until you see the North Butte sign. The North Butte trail (. 2 mile) has views of the islands and the Canadian Cascades. We saw a handful of eagles and turkey vultures hovering over the conifer forest. There’s a hidden cliff about 100 feet east that will also give you views of Mount Baker and Twin Sisters. \nWe detoured to Lily Lake campground before heading back. \nSome like to do a loop by heading east on the Lily Lizard Trail to return to the parking lot. Others find it easier to backtrack on the same route. \nNote: There were not many trail signs posted when we hiked earlier in the year, but a state Department of Natural Resources manager says volunteers have put up several trail signs and maps along the trails since. \nRestrictions: Open 24 hours. Leash law in effect. Not wheelchair accessible. Discover Pass required. \nDirections: Take Interstate 5 to Exit 240, Lake Samish Road, turn left onto Lake Samish Road and left onto Barrel Springs Road. Look for signs to the Blanchard Hill Trail. Park at the lower trailhead or go a mile up to the upper trailhead. \nMore information: dnr.wa.gov . For a detailed map see bit.ly/1I175Y4 . Tan Vinh: 206-515-5656 or tvinh@seattletimes.com .
