No personally identifiable information will be collected through this pilot program. Operating in a transmit mode similar to GPS, beacons cannot see, collect or store any personal data or consumer information. Beacons are transmit-only Bluetooth low energy devices that send out a signal that can only be used by user-enabled apps running on mobile devices to trigger location-specific content. In order for a mobile device to detect a beacon, a user must download an app that utilizes the technology and opt-in to allow the app to receive the beacon's signal.\n\"As a leader in working with municipalities and transit authorities around the country, Intersection is committed to exploring ways in which technology can enable citizens to have more unique, tailored experiences with both cities and brands,\" said Dave Etherington , Chief Strategy Officer, Intersection. \"The MBTA is on the forefront of deploying technology that seeks to improve the experience for its millions of riders, making it the perfect fit for this pilot program. We look forward to working with the MBTA and brands to fully understand how this technology can benefit riders in an open, transparent manner that prioritizes consumer privacy and security.\"\n\"Gimbal beacon technology is enabling cities to become more connected and deliver enhanced, relevant experiences and services to its residents and visitors,\" said Ray Rotolo , senior vice president of Out of Home Assets, Gimbal. \"We see tremendous opportunities in leveraging key transportation hubs where millions of riders on a weekly basis can benefit from digital engagements and information.\"\nIntersection's media line of business manages municipal and transit media for 46 North American markets including Boston , Seattle , Charlotte , Chicago , Dallas , Los Angeles and Orange County , Minneapolis/St. Paul , New Jersey , New York and Westchester County, Philadelphia , Pittsburgh , and San Francisco .\nAbout Intersection\nIntersection combines expertise in technology, media and user experience at the convergence of digital and physical worlds to improve life in cities around the world. Intersection is the result of a merger between Control Group and Titan, key members of the team behind LinkNYC, the groundbreaking project to turn payphones into urban information hubs.
