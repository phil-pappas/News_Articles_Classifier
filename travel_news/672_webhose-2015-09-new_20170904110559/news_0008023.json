It is now. Comment Neosho Daily News - Neosho, MO By Todd Nighswonger Posted Sep. 24, 2015 at 7:41 PM By Todd Nighswonger Posted Sep. 24, 2015 at 7:41 PM Seeing the pope wasn’t on Jeanne Morrow’s bucket list. It is now. Morrow, a member of St. Canera Catholic Church in Neosho, didn’t plan on seeing the pope in the United States, but that changed for the women in her 70s after learning earlier this year that Pope Francis was going to visit the country this week. “I figured it would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience,” she said, adding she didn’t figure to get another chance. Morrow and Colleen Billig of Neosho will join a bus today in Joplin for the trip to Pennsylvania. Along the way, they will stay overnight in Indiana and spend Saturday night in a hotel outside Philadelphia, which Morrow said travel will be restricted for the pope’s visit. Morrow and Billig will be among an expected 1 million people to attend a Sunday afternoon outdoor mass. Morrow said she was told that those attending the mass may have to walk a more or two to reach the location. “I don’t have any big expectations. I have no idea how close I’ll get,” Morrow said, figuring she’ll get to see the pope, if not close up. “They may have Jumbotrons everywhere.” The bus will begin its return trip Monday morning, Morrow said. “I’m kind of looking at it as the experience and the journey,” she said.
