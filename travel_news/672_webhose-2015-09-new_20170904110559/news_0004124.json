Photo courtesy of Yew Tree Farm Rent Beatrix Potter's Yew Tree Farm and you may have to compete with Peter Rabbit for the lettuces in the kitchen garden. \nStill, what an lovely place to spend a family vacation in England's Lake District. If you've seen the film Miss Potter with Ren√©e Zellweger, you've already seen the picturesque white cottage at Yew Tree Farm. Painted a weathered green for the film, it stood in for Hill Top, her famous home in the Lakes. \nHill Top is owned by the National Trust and open to the public as a museum. But the creator of Peter Rabbit, Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, Jemima Puddle-Duck, Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail , owned this farm too, along with many others. After adopting the Lake District as her home, she added farming to her many interests. Over time, to save a traditional way of life that she loved, she bought 15 surrounding farms. She left them to the National Trust on condition that they be rented out as working farms. A Working Farm in the Lakelands \nMany people know of the National Trust as a preserver of important and historic estates. You may also be aware that some National Trust properties are let as vacation accommodations. What is less well known is that they also rent farms, on long term leases, to working tenant farmers. Yew Tree Farm, near Coniston, is one of these. \nIf you decide to visit, you won't be renting from the National Trust, but, through rental agents, from the farm family who run the place - raising sheep, cattle and pigs - and who occupy part of the Grade II Listed property. The Farmhouse at Yew Tree Farm \nThe house, available as a self-contained, luxury, self-catering unit, dates from the early 1600s Newer additions were added in the 1720s. Potter lived there in the 1930s and some of her original furniture is still in use. For a time, she ran a tea shop in what is now the dining room - still using Miss Potter's original table. \nIt has loads of period features including pitched, beamed ceilings, oak floors, four poster beds, open fireplaces and a period oak staircase with 250 year old panelling. It also has plenty of luxury mod cons - a nice new kitchen, plenty of bathrooms and shower rooms with heated floors and, something Miss Potter surely never dreamed of, an outdoor hot tub. \nRates are lowest in the winter months but oil heating and hot water as well as down-filled comforters are included in the rent so a cosy, wintry stay is possible. The house sleeps up to six people and one well-behaved dog. The Setting \nAmong the animals reared at Yew Tree Farm are Herdwick sheep, a rare Lake District breed that Beatrix Potter herself championed. The farm's beefy, curly-haired cattle are Belted Galloways. And apparently the farm couple are happy for you to gather your own breakfast eggs from their chickens. \nSet in the Coniston Valley, the farm is surrounded by fishing lakes, cycle paths, accessible walks at Tarn Hows, more challenging walks in the higher fells and the romantic Lake Windermere and Coniston Water. \nFind out more about what's happening, month by month on the farm on their interactive website. The Reality Check Prices at Yew Tree Farm are in keeping with its status as luxury accommodation and a national landmark. A group of friends sharing costs could find it more affordable than a single family. Despite its isolated appearance in photographs, the farmhouse is just up a short driveway from a main route through the Lake District which can be busy in summer. If you go with a pet, you'll have to keep it under control. There is hourly bus service from Ambleside, about 40 minutes away, but you will probably need a car to get around. If you are thinking about a white Christmas in the Lakes, think again. Most years if there's snow lower than the high peaks, it will fall much later in the winter.
