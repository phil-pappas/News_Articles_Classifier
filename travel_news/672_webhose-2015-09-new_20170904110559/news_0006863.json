Photo: Tourist Police Division Thailand's Tourist Police launched a new smartphone application last week in hopes of improving service and convenience for tourists - but those on the tourist island of Phuket. The augmented reality application, ’Thailand Tourist Trips and Tips AR Book’, enables tourists to use their smartphones to learn about the basics of Thai culture; to get tips on cultural sensitivity; and to receive information and location links to tourist destinations as part of this year's 'Discover Thainess' campaign. The application is a 3D cartoon model with a 360-degree view, and it’s available in 3 languages - Thai, English and Chinese. In addition, important information, such as location links and contact details for Tourist Police Stations across the country, as well as their Call Center hotline, can be directly accessed through the app. \"It is a model campaign launched in Bangkok only. At this time, we have yet to receive any official order to carry out the campaign in Phuket,\" said Phuket Tourist Police Chief Urumporn Koondejsumrit. \"Though not available here, tourists will be able to download the application, which I believe will be useful throughout Thailand.\" The goal of the project is to accelerate and increase tourism revenue to 2.3 trillion baht in 2016, explained Tourist Police Division Commander Suprapone Arunsit at the launch. \"The Tourist Police Division is helping to achieve this goal by boosting and enhancing the tourists' confidence in their safety, while promoting cultural and historic attractions,\" said Maj Gen Suprapone. - See more at: phuket gazette.net/ phuket -news/New-3D-smartphone-app-aims-help-tourists/61996#ad-image-0\">http://www. phuket gazette.net/ phuket -news/New-3D-smartphone-app-aims-help-tourists/61996#ad-image-0 93 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T06:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T10:14:20.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
