Business travel programmes such as British Airways’ On Business can help take the sting out of the cost of regular business travel, but the truth is that there are always times when you can’t be with your team – no matter how often you fly. According to research by PGi, a provider of meetings and collaboration software, 59pc of staff in EMEA now work outside the office one day a week, while 27pc do it two or three days weekly. Briefing such remote teams fully then leaving them to get on with the job requires a healthy degree of trust – but many managers find that pulling this off calls for much more than that. Remote working should never mean remote management, a conversation goes a long way The first thing to ensure is that communication is reciprocal. If you send a message to your team, make sure that they can reply easily and engage in a conversation. Recent research by the University of Wisconsin showed that girls who had been through a stressful situation (doing complex maths problems in front of an audience) experienced a major drop in the level of the stress hormone cortisol if they had talked to their mothers afterwards, compared to those who just received a text. While you shouldn’t be “mothering” staff, remote working should never mean remote management, and a conversation goes a long way. To that end, make your chats brief and frequent. It’s better to have a five- or 10-minute catch-up call every day than wait a week and keep the team on the line for an hour or so. And when it comes to conference calls, video trumps traditional every time. Technology such as Skype, Google Hangouts and Sqwiggle is now commonplace, so there’s no excuse for not being able to speak face-to-face to your team. As if often the case with international businesses, if your remote team comprises employees from different cultures, miscommunication can be magnified by technology and remote communications, so the closer you can get to actually being in the same room, the better. “Facial expression is very important – there are more muscles in your face than there are in the whole of the rest of your body,” says Peter Nicholas of Threshold, a company specialising in communication and behaviour change. That means video calling is a powerful tool for managers who can’t be in the room. “Also, whether it’s video or a conference call, encourage all the participants to concentrate,” says Mr Nicholas. “That means asking them to switch off their emails and not to text during the conversation.” That might be a challenge if you’re encouraging your staff to be “always on”. But just because mobile, cloud-based technology allows anyone, anywhere, to gain access to essential information, that doesn’t mean remote staff should be bombarded with messages. Some managers have a tendency to double up on memos when they can’t be with staff, but constant requests for updates on client records, sales figures or meetings are more likely to be seen as nagging rather than inspirational management – and that’s not good for anyone’s cortisol levels. • Find out more about how your company can make savings on business travel by visiting British Airways On Business", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T20:36:09.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
