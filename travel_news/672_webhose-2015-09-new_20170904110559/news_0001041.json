It remains unclear why the system failed, which uses a list of factors such as temperature, wind, air pressure, and the aircraft’s load to generate its data. \nAfter landing in Doha’s Hamad International airport, an “inspection revealed damage to underbelly of aircraft described as substantial.” \n“Qatar… reported to the FAA that they found some dents and scratches on the belly of flight 778, a Boeing 777,” the FAA told aviation news website Flightglobal. \nThe U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is yet to launch an official investigation but is “gathering information.” \n“We have investigators gathering information to determine the extent of the damage,” the NTSB told Flightglobal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T02:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T04:19:41.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
