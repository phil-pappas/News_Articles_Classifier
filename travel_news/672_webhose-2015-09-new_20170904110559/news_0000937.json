Smooth the surface.\nPlace a candy eye in the center (or draw one with black frosting)\nUse red gel frosting to drizzle squiggly lines from the center of the cake to the edges, giving the top of the cupcake a bloodshot look.\nPer eyeball: 364 calories (percent of calories from fat, 42), 3 grams protein, 51 grams carbohydrates, 1 gram fiber, 17 grams fat (10 grams saturated), 96 milligrams cholesterol, 217 milligrams sodium.\nThe Best Rest\n12 cupcakes\nFor the gravestones, choose cookies with a rectangular or oval shape, such as Murray Coconut Bars or Pepperidge Farm Milanos.\n1 cup white chocolate chips\n12 rectangular or oval cookies\nBlack edible color marker or black frosting and decorator's writing tip\n1 cup flaked sweetened coconut\n2 to 3 drops green food coloring\nChocolate frosting (see the end of this story for recipe)\nTo make the gravestones: In a microwave-safe bowl, heat white chocolate chips at 50 percent power for 45 seconds. Stir, then heat 30 seconds at 50 percent power. Stir. Repeat as necessary until white chocolate is almost melted, then stir until it is smooth, taking care not to burn the white chocolate. Dip cookies two-thirds of the way into the white chocolate and gently shake off the extra, or use a small flat spatula to spread the white chocolate on the top two-thirds of both sides of the cookie. (The uncoated end will go into the cupcake.) Set on wax paper to cool and harden. When the white chocolate has completely hardened, use an edible decorator's marker or frosting to write \"R.I.P.\" on one side of the cookies. Set aside.\nTo make the grass: Place coconut in a plastic container with a lid. Add green food coloring to the coconut; cover the container and shake until all the coconut is evenly colored.\nGenerously frost cupcakes with chocolate frosting.

Even easier: Skip the dipping/frosting step and buy Peeps marshmallow ghost candies instead of Nutter Butters.\n1 cup white chocolate chips\n12 Nutter Butter cookies\nEdible color markers or black frosting and decorator's writing tip\nChocolate Frosting (or white frosting tinted orange)\nTo make the ghosts: In a microwave-safe bowl, heat 1 cup white chocolate chips at 50 percent power for 45 seconds. Stir, then heat 30 seconds at 50 percent power. Stir. Repeat as necessary until white chocolate is almost melted, then stir until it is smooth, taking care not to burn the white chocolate. Dip Nutter Butter three-fourths of the way into the white chocolate, or use a small flat spatula to spread the white chocolate over three-fourths of the cookie. (The uncoated end will go into the cupcake.) Set on wax paper to cool and harden. When the white chocolate has completely hardened, use edible decorator's markers or frosting to paint eyes and mouths on the ghosts. Set aside.\nGenerously frost the cupcakes in chocolate or orange-colored icing. Press the \"ghosts, \" uncoated side down, into the center of the cakes.\nPer ghostcake: 529 calories (percent of calories from fat, 45), 7 grams protein, 68 grams carbohydrates, 1 gram fiber, 27 grams fat (9 grams saturated), 35 milligrams cholesterol, 502 milligrams sodium.\nElegant Infestation\n12 cupcakes\nThese cupcakes would have been lovely, if only vermin hadn't found them first.\nStore-bought orange cupcake frosting (or Basic Buttercream Frosting tinted orange)\nPlastic vermin (rats and roaches are available at Cake Art)\nTo generously frost cupcakes: Hold the frosting can directly above the cupcake. Squeeze the frosting onto the cake in a spiral pattern, starting at the outside and working toward the center. When you reach the center, lift the frosting tip as you release pressure, creating a decorative peak. (You can also use a decorating bag fitted with a large star tip, such as Wilton's No. 1M.)\nWash plastic vermin in dish detergent and water; rinse and dry thoroughly. Insert the toys into the frosting to make it look as if they are crawling over the cupcakes. Cut some toys in half and put the heads in one side and the tails in the other, so it looks like the critters are crawling through the frosting.\nPer cupcake: 364 calories (percent of calories from fat, 42), 3 grams protein, 51 grams carbohydrates, 1 gram fiber, 17 grams fat (10 grams saturated), 96 milligrams cholesterol, 217 milligrams sodium.\nSpooky Spiders\n12 cupcakes\nMmm . . .. spiders.\n1 cup chocolate chips\n1/4 cup raisins\n1 cup chow mein noodles\n24 red-hot cinnamon candies\nBasic Buttercream Frosting, tinted yellow\nTo make the spiders: In a microwave-safe bowl, heat chocolate chips at 50 percent power for 45 seconds. Stir, then heat 30 seconds at 50 percent power. Stir. Repeat as necessary until chocolate is almost melted, then stir until it is smooth, taking care not to burn it. Remove a few spoonfuls of the melted chocolate to a small bowl. Stir in 1/4 cup raisins. Spoon out a few raisins at a time, mounding them 4 inches apart on wax paper, to create 12 spider \"bodies.\" (Make a few extra for backup.) To the reserved chocolate, add 1 cup chow mein noodles. Gently stir to coat the noodles. Scoop them out onto a separate sheet of wax paper. Select 8 of the most leglike noodles (1 to 2 inches long, with a slight curve) to arrange around each cluster of raisins, pressing gently into the cluster. Press 2 red-hot cinnamon candies into the clusters for eyes. Allow the chocolate to harden completely. (Spread any remaining chocolate-covered noodles on the wax paper to dry; you may need some backups if any legs break after the spiders set.)\nGenerously frost the cupcakes. Gently remove the spiders from the wax paper and place one in the center of each cupcake. Touch up the spiders with replacement legs, if needed.\nPer spider: 134 calories (percent of calories from fat, 41), 1 gram protein, 20 grams carbohydrates, 1 gram fiber, 7 grams fat (3 grams saturated), no cholesterol, 19 milligrams sodium.\nFinancial Ruin\n12 cupcakes\nQuestion: What's scarier than a shrinking economy?\nAnswer: Nothing.

(Yes, you can use a cake mix, but where's the fun in that?) Avoid poundcake recipes, unless you want very dense cakes. For nicely rounded cupcakes, defy the traditional instructions to fill cupcake molds two-thirds full and instead fill the molds about three-fourths full.\nChocolate-Chocolate Cupcakes\n12 cupcakes\nHands on: 20 minutes\nTotal time: 45 minutes\nVery dark, not very sweet chocolate cake makes this a perfect dessert for grown-up parties.\n1 cup all-purpose flour\n1/4 cup cocoa powder\n1/4 teaspoon baking powder\n1/4 teaspoon baking soda\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature\n3/4 cup granulated sugar\n1 egg\n1 egg yolk\n1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1/2 cup buttermilk\n2 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, melted and cooled\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees.
