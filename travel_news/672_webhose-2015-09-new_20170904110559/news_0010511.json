The Business and Strategy Conference is a key component of Helitech International’s three day Education Programme, run in conjunction with the main exhibition which takes place from 6-8 October at ExCeL London.\nOn Tuesday 6 October the UAV Focus On session will run in the afternoon in parallel to the Futureproof – Three Perspectives session, which covers new technology, upcoming critical issues and the potential benefits of training pilots with simulators in the rotorcraft industry. The UAV session will investigate the potential for operators to develop sustainable business models by incorporating a UAV division into their day to day operations.\nAlix Leboulanger, Aerospace and Defence Research Analyst from Frost and Sullivan, will outline commercial UAVs and helicopter synergies, and Angus Benson-Blair, Chairman of the Association of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems UK, will discuss the marketplace for UAV operators. The UAV session will also include two case studies before ending with a discussion panel on UAV opportunities for the rotorcraft sector.\nThe Offshore Wind Farm Focus On session, taking place on Wednesday afternoon, will look at global market trends and opportunities for offshore wind farms, along with the predicted demands for rotorcraft to meet the needs of the offshore wind sector, and the challenges the rotorcraft sector faces to support the offshore wind market.\nThese new Focus On sessions mark a significant new chapter for the Business and Strategy Conference, which opens with the Business Leaders Forum, a well attended event with senior industry leaders discussing key issues facing the rotorcraft industry over the next five to ten years. Lined up to speak are Patrick Moulay, Vice President Sales and Marketing of Bell Helicopters; David Balevic, Senior Vice President, Engineering & Operations of CHC; Jason Propes, Senior Vice President – Helicopters of Rolls-Royce; and Daniel Rosenthal, President of Milestone Aviation.\nThe Education Programme continues with the European Helicopter Association (EHA) Rotorcraft Seminars on Wednesday 7 October, with morning and afternoon sessions on rulemaking and air traffic management, including a keynote address from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and sessions covering everything from European regulation changes to the benefits of the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) programme.\nThe final day of the Education Programme is reserved for the Safety Workshop, where the highlight of the day is undoubtedly the keynote session on Preparation for Flight, hosted by the legendary Captain Eric ‘Winkle’ Brown, who holds the world record for the most types of aircraft flown at 487, along with the world record for the most aircraft carrier landings at 2407, and is the Fleet Air Arm’s most decorated living pilot. Captain Brown will provide his insights into how being prepared for flight helped him achieve unparalleled success in his career.\nThe rest of the Safety Workshop will provide an introduction to the European Helicopter Safety Team (EHEST) and the International Helicopter Safety Team (IHST). There will also be several sessions discussing issues and concerns over automated systems and cockpits, and how training for them should be conducted, as well as sessions to introduce the new EHEST Instructor Training Manual and their new risk assessment tool, MARIA.\nSource:- Reed Exhibitions", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T23:07:22.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
