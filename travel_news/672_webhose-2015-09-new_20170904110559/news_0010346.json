I was in the middle of asking how to cook some disarmingly large frogs that were trying to escape from a net when I saw five or six different species of crab on a tray. They looked very similar to our own, the brown crab. Indeed, they were our own brown crabs and had probably come all the way from Devon - my friend Mitch Tonks says that the majority of those sold on the market in Brixham get sent live to China. Not surprisingly, I bought one and took it into the restaurant next door (which is what you do there), where I had it wok fried with salted preserved duck egg yolks. It was very good, but not something I could write a recipe for over here. • Rick Stein: 'I didn’t want to cook cheffy food’ I very much enjoy Chinese ways with seafood, particularly fish steamed with garlic, spring onions and ginger or lobsters coated with salt, Sichuan pepper and cornflour and fried until crisp. Stein has 10 restaurants, including Sandbanks, a seafood restaurant But I wish that our own enthusiasm for the brown crab was such that none of them need be exported. At the moment the price is extremely reasonable - we’re charging £10 per kilo at Stein’s Fisheries in Padstow – and to put this in context, the retail price for Australian mud crabs, perhaps the most similar, is $40. • Rick Stein's seafood linguine recipe The main reason for the large difference in price is simply that the Chinese and Japanese adore Australian crabs and will pay big money for them, as I suspect they will eventually end up doing for ours. I’d like us all to eat more crab, and in an attempt to persuade you to think seriously more about it here’s my advice on choosing, preparing and cooking the best. How to choose your crab A crab with plenty of meat in it should feel heavy for its size. I know that’s difficult to judge if you not used to it, but the lighter the crab the more watery it is likely to be inside. Cock crabs, identifiable by their larger claws and a narrow tail flap, contain more white meat than hens (which have a wide tail flap), but a heavy-feeling hen will usually contain roe and good quality brown meat. So generally I go for cocks for white meat and hens for brown. If possible, it’s better to buy live crabs than cooked crabs. This is because, in my opinion, there’s never enough salt in the water of cooked crabs, which should be about the same salinity as sea water: 35g to the litre. Rick Stein's cock crab with homemade mayonnaise recipe Sharing a couple of large cock crabs with a few people is one of life’s simple pleasures. You really need to buy a crab pick for each person to make extracting the meat from all the cavities possible. SERVES 4 INGREDIENTS • 2 x 1.5 to 2 kg live crabs • 5 litres of water • 1.65g of salt For the mayonnaise: • 2 egg yolks • 2 tsps. white wine vinegar • ½ tsp. salt • 300 ml sunflower oil • 1 tbsp. English mustard from a jar For the potatoes: • 800g new soft skinned potatoes • 4 litres of cold water • 1 tablespoon of salt • 1 bunch of fresh mint METHOD Put the crabs in five litres of cold water and add the salt, bring to the boil and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove the crabs from the water and leave to cool. Pull the legs and claws off the crab. Break off and discard the tail flap. Insert the blade of a sharp knife in between the body and the back shell and twist to separate them. Pull off the feathery like gills, or dead man’s fingers, from the body and discard. Remove the stomach sack from the back shell by pressing on the little piece of shell just behind the eyes. Empty any excess water out of the back shell. Cut each body in half with a large knife assisted by a few taps from the end of a rolling pin. • Crab recipes to get your claws into Crack each of the claws and legs with a rolling pin or hammer but try not to shatter the shell completely. Now reassemble each crab as neatly as you can. Work some of the skin off the potatoes with the edge of a knife. Boil the potatoes with the fresh mint until tender. For the mayonnaise make sure all the ingredients are at room temperature. Put the egg yolks, vinegar, salt and mustard into a mixing bowl and whisk together, I always use an electric whisk; then add the oil a few drops at a time increasing the flow as the mayonnaise builds up. • The very best flavoured mayonnaise Serve the crab with the mayonnaise and new potatoes and a soft leaf lettuce salad.
