Make a long weekend of it—before it gets too cold.\nFriday\nThe train lets off downtown, then it’s a fifteen-minute stroll down Cookman Avenue to the ocean, with plenty of shops to peek into along the way. Browse the beach-cottage decor at Salt Design Co. , Shelter Home , and House of Modern Living. Or sift through vintage threads at Backward Glances , in the basement of The Shoppes at the Arcade, and stock up on breezy tie-dye dresses and Breton tops at Interwoven .\nBut don’t linger too long. Have a pint at boardwalk surfer bar Asbury Park Yacht Club as the sun sets over the Atlantic. If the spirit moves you, switch to craft brews at a long wooden table in the European-style Asbury Festhalle & Biergarten .\nStylish hotel offerings are still limited, so book early to score one of the four rooms in the Asbury Park Inn , a chic spot to lay your head just three blocks from the sea with gourmet breakfasts and bright, modern design. The neighboring town of Ocean Grove is also filled with cozy Victorian B&Bs , many with porches looking out to the sea. Saturday\nAlong the mile-long boardwalk, New Yorkers may feel like they’re back on the Williamsburg waterfront. Food trucks—ceviche and empanadas at Runa, egg sandwiches from Johnny’s Pork-Roll—gather just north of the Convention Center at North Eats . At the seasonal Market at Fifth Avenue , independent designers hawk eminently stylish goods, like woven leather dog collars and leashes ( Gitli Goods ) and locally made wooden sunglasses ( ACDWSH ).\nFor a quieter afternoon, wander down the boardwalk to neighboring Ocean Grove, a town founded as a Methodist summer retreat, with Victorian mansions; canvas-tent summer homes; and an 1894-built, 6,000-seat wooden auditorium that hosts free concerts with the 11,010-pipe organ on most Saturday afternoons. As the sun goes down, explore downtown Asbury Park’s burgeoning dining scene. Talula’s , opened by vets of New York City’s Saltie and L.A.’s The Bread Lounge, fires pizzas topped with regional produce in a wood-burning oven. Mogo serves Korean-fusion tacos at a sit-down spot in downtown and a stand on the boardwalk. And the just-opened chowder house The Bonney Read shucks fresh oysters and pours cask rums on Cookman Avenue. The sixties doo-wop- and R&B-infused S.O.A.P. (Sound of Asbury Park) and Bruce Springsteen’s 1973 classic Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. put the city on the musical map, and venues like The Stone Pony , Wonder Bar , and the vintage bowling alley–music hall Asbury Lanes keep the tradition alive. Save your quarters to try your hand at the vintage pinball machines at the boardwalk’s Silverball Museum . And see why Asbury Park is the center of gay nightlife on the Shore, by stopping by the poolside Paradise Nightclub at The Empress Hotel , owned by Shep Pettibone, who produced many of Madonna’s eighties hits.\nSunday\nAfter a morning enjoying the waves, stop for a lazy late brunch on your way out of town. The Speakeatery makes gourmet versions of the Jersey Shore staple overstuffed Italian sandwiches—try the Back-Alley Brawler, a chicken cutlet, homemade mozzarella, and sautéed broccoli rabe on a garlic-bread hero. Or linger over Toast’s grilled cinnamon buns and crab cakes Benedict. Then visit downtown galleries— Parlor Gallery and Exhibit No.9 are standouts—as you make your way home again.", "external_links": ["http://www.thesaltyhome.com/", "http://www.stoneponyonline.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/North-Eats-Asbury-Park/454898161343552", "http://www.thespeakeatery.com/", "http://oceangrove.org/Great_Auditorium", "http://www.gitligoods.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/AsburyParkYachtClub", "http://talulaspizza.com/", "http://www.asburyempress.com/", "http://www.marketatfifthavenue.com/", "http://asburyparkinn.com/", "http://silverballmuseum.com/", "http://www.eatmogo.com/", "http://www.acdwsh.com/", "http://www.backwardglances.com/", "http://shelterhome.com/", "http://toastasburypark.com/", "http://www.parlor-gallery.com/", "http://exhibitnumber9.com/", "http://www.asburylanes.com/", "http://www.interwovenap.com/", "http://www.thebonneyread.com/%20", "http://www.oceangrovenj.com/new-jersey-shore-hotels-bed-breakfast.html", "http://www.wonderbarasburypark.com/"], "published": "2015-09-04T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T14:39:56.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
