Additionally, 18 billion yen in new capital will be injected from a private equity fund and ANA Holdings, the parent firm of the airline. \n\n“We are considering the ways in which we will work together in the future,” Maho Ito, a press official for ANA, told TTG Asia e-Daily . “The details have yet to be decided but we anticipate this will mean codesharing on some routes, although it will take some time to coordinate ticketing and other systems.” \n\nIto admitted that the two airlines are “rivals” but added that ANA has a tradition of assisting fledgling airlines, including Air Do and Starflyer. \n\nSkymark declined to comment on the agreement, but said in a statement: “Skymark will make repayments to creditors in accordance with the rehabilitation plan and will make every effort to implement it. We request your full support in this regard.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T11:56:54.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
