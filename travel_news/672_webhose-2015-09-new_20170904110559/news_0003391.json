It is a great honour for the OPW to be involved in this event helping to promote the importance of the honeybee”.\nOver the past number of years, there has been a serious decline in the honeybee population worldwide and great efforts are being made by countries to protect the honeybee. The threat comes from many sources including insecticides, pesticides, weather and man, to name a few.\nMinister Harris added ” What better place than in this wonderful Park, with its considerable range of habitats and walled gardens, for the location of hives, which help to sustain the high biodiversity value of the park for future generations. The new wildflower meadow in the walled garden here at the Visitor Centre, has become a haven for our honeybees, our butterflies and moths, never mind the birds that will feast on its plentiful harvest. I was very interested to learn that one bee can pollinate up to 1000 flowers per day and the estimated value of bee pollination is worth €57 million to the Irish economy”.\nMinister Harris concluded ” Next Spring, my Office, hopes to hold beekeeping classes here in the Visitor Centre in association with the County Dublin Beekeepers Association and I have no doubt that, judging from the attendance and enthusiasm here today, there will be no shortage of interest in learning more about the wonderful world of the honeybee”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T14:08:26.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
