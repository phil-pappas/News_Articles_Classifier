But the aesthetic for the after-party celebrating the collection? The brand’s designers, sisters Laura Mulleavy and Kate Mulleavy , much prefer a laid-back, pretension-free good time—a very welcome gesture as the exhaustion inherent during the back end of New York Fashion Week has begun to set in.\nGathering on the rooftop of The Jane hotel, a West Village go-to spot since its revamp in 2008, fashion insiders and Rodarte friends including Miguel , Sofía Sanchez de Betak , and Vogue ’s Elisabeth von Thurn und Taxis took in a perfectly crisp almost-fall night. Eventually, guests moved inside for a raucous dance party characteristic of Rodarte get-togethers. (The sisters’ propensity for the limbo is the stuff of dreams.) The DJ played everything from New Order to Kool & the Gang, and nobody seemed to be having a better time on the floor than gamine wunderkind Tavi Gevinson —except maybe eternal cool-girl Kim Gordon , all smiles and stunning in an asymmetrical black frock. Unlike many NYFW parties, there was refreshingly no apparent Instagram fodder, certainly no hashtag, until a huge cake was brought out in celebration and guests couldn’t help but snap a shot. Seconds later, it was back to the important business: dancing, friends, and, yes, toasting damn good fashion.\nMeanwhile, the dancing continued at Elyx House in Soho where the Brazil Foundation hosted its 15th anniversary bash. Taking in the festivities were Mario Testino flanked by gorgeous gals Alessandra Ambrosio and Jessica Hart , Vogue’ s Hamish Bowles , and a gaggle of pretty young things including Alexia Niedzielski , P rincess Deena Aljuhani Abdulaziz , and Laura de Gunzburg . In the lush landscaped surroundings, everyone celebrated the beginning of the end of NYFW.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T22:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T00:06:39.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
