Long-term and comprehensive social stability is a key task,” Mr Xi said. Speaking at a two-day meeting in late August in Beijing on Tibet and the Tibetan areas, Mr Xi stressed that China should “firmly take the initiative” in the fight against separatism, and said communications between ethnic groups should be encouraged. The authorities must draft long-term plans for Tibet and its neighbouring provinces... Reviewing the development and progress that Tibet has achieved in the past six decades, he said, it was necessary to fight against separatism and apply long-term policies and measures to its address its root causes. He stated that social stability provides the basis for advancing development and prosperity for people of all ethnic groups in Tibet. The meeting reviewed previous work on Tibet and charted a course for its development along with that of Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu and Qinghai provinces. Mr Xi said the authorities must draft long-term plans for Tibet and its neighbouring provinces, which are home to many Tibetans and people of other ethnic groups. He also called for more efforts to promote economic growth and all-round social progress in the Tibetan-inhabited areas of Qinghai, Sichuan, Yunnan and Gansu. Tibet and Tibetan-inhabited areas in the four other provinces have entered “a critical stage” towards fulfi lling the country’s goal of building a moderately prosperous society in a comprehensive way, Mr Xi said at the meeting. More active employment policies should be carried out to help residents of all ethnic groups Special financial, tax and investment policies for the autonomous region and these areas should continue, and development that improves the living conditions of the various ethnic groups should be advanced in a prudent and steady manner, Mr Xi said. He urged the authorities in these areas to improve the basic public services they provide and adopt targeted measures to alleviate poverty and improve the lives of impoverished people as soon as possible. “More active employment policies should be carried out to help residents of all ethnic groups,” he said. Addressing the same meeting, Premier Li Keqiang said the authorities should give top priority to improving people’s livelihoods, alleviating poverty and increasing employment among Tibetans, and he urged more efforts to boost education, health care and social security in the region. Tibet should strengthen its self-development capabilities through promoting its special industries, infrastructure construction, and environmental protection, said the premier. Mr Li pledged to increase financial aid and preferential policies to the ethnic minority areas.
