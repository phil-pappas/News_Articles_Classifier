This is within the ITB Asia travel mart and is free for all ITB Asia delegates. Arrangements have also been made for a visitor pass at discounted rates. \n\nSeats are on a first-come, first-served basis as the room can accommodate only 150 pax. To date, a steady stream of registrations has been received. Whether you are the media, PR practitioner, seller, buyer or NTO official, TTG Asia Media welcomes you to the workshop. \n\nSecure a seat on the website or contact Stephanie Toh at (+65) 6395-7531 or stephanie.toh@ttgasia.com \n\nJournalists and media practitioners speaking at the workshop include Kannan Chandran, founder and publisher of E-Quill News Media and Six-Six News; Imtiaz Muqbil, executive editor of Travel Impact Newswire; and Ken Scott, former journalist and now PR practitioner of Scott Asia Communications. \n\nListen also to the real experiences and recovery updates from direct sources including Marcus Cotton, managing director of Tiger Mountain Nepal, and Jamili Nais, director of Sabah Parks, who was personally involved in the search, rescue and now rebuilding of Kota Kinabalu mountain trails. \n\nData-driven analysts include Stewart Hunter, director Asia-Pacific of Sojern, and Todd Arthur, managing director Asia-Pacific of HRS. \n\nGet the updates, listen to the media, hear the facts – register now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T00:40:55.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
