Matthew Purton, Director of Group Charter at the company’s London office, comments: “Since the final whistle of the most exciting Six Nations in years in March of this year, we have been helping to plan flight schedules for this tournament. \n\"With offices based in almost half the nations taking part, we have been exceptionally busy around the world organising the next few weeks’ travel for the competing sides’ supporters, sponsors, media and, of course, the teams themselves . “Over the first weekend alone, our French office oversaw almost thirty flights, carrying thousands of fans, as well as some celebrities, to England to cheer their team on to victory. It is the ideal way for large groups of passengers to travel and we do many flights for sports teams and fans throughout the course of the year, but over these next few weeks we have a much higher intensity of charters than usual. “With the tournament being in England we are finding that it is close enough for some European fans to treat the games as day trips, returning home shortly after each game. Regular airlines simply don’t have the capacity or schedules to cope with the volume of supporters wishing to travel over here at the times they want, meaning charters are the obvious option.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T12:21:33.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
