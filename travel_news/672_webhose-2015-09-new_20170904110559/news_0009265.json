The higher the money supply growth, the higher the growth in available funds. On the contrary, if money supply growth slows, it can have a negative effect on economic growth.\nIf the money supply grows much faster than the economy, then rapid inflation ensues, and people lose faith in the value of the money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T17:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:37:56.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
