An opening reception will be held on Friday from 5-7 p.m. with an artist talk at 6 p.m. \nThe exhibit features 21 landscape and wildlife images taken at national parks around the U.S. and Canada. Harvey's use of rich color and subtle light give her images a stillness that allows the photograph to reveal itself slowly as it tells the story of national parks. \nHarvey says the images represent some of her favorite moments and convey her passion for traveling and seeing the world. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T09:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T11:17:17.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
