That's the challenge Trinity Audio Engineering has taken up. Starting out on Kickstarter earlier this year (and raising over £100,000) its in-ear headphones are now available to purchase direct from the company. I've had a chance to review the Delta model and found a great sound at a competitive price.[caption id=\"attachment_20807\" align=\"\" width=\"1024\"] Trinity Delta In-Ear Headphones (image: Ewan Spence)[/caption]As with many in-ear style monitor headphones, the Trinity Delta retail package comes with a number of different tips to get the best fit inside your ear. There are seven to choose from, and I was lucky enough to have the set on the headphones be the ones that worked best in my ears. Otherwise a careful reading of the instruction manual will tell you the best way to remove old tips and place new ones over each in-ear housing.Pay attention to this because if you try to twist the tip off the wrong way, you'll unscrew the entire forward assembly. This is by design, as you can choose between three different pairs of sound filters that will give you a neutral smooth sound, boost the bass, or lift the treble. It's not something you'll change on a regular basis, but most people will settle for one base profile and then use whatever graphical equalizer is present on the playing device to fine-tune the sound. I settled for the smooth filter, if you wanted to know.[caption id=\"attachment_20809\" align=\"\" width=\"1024\"] Trinity Delta In-Ear Headphones (image: Ewan Spence)[/caption]These are packaged in a metallic container that matches the style of the 3.5mm jack plug, and sits nicely inside the supplied pocket carry-case. An L-shaped 3.5mm extender is also included which may or may not be required depending on the equipment you use.The final piece of equipment in the kit is probably the most important - it's a tie clip that allows you to fix the cable to your clothes. You'll want to use this as much as possible, because the cable transmits movement, especially from walking, into the monitors. The tie clip stops much of this echoing in your ears. Given the focus on ensuring that the cable's entry into the monitor has enough strain relief, I would have preferred to hear more relief in the monitors from cable flex, rather than relying on a clip.[caption id=\"attachment_20810\" align=\"\" width=\"1024\"] Trinity Delta In-Ear Headphones (image: Ewan Spence)[/caption]Has the promise of high-quality audio been met? It certainly sounds it. There's a wide frequency range that brings out a surprising amount of bass from the small units, and there's a clear definition to the higher tones in vocal and orchestral work.[caption id=\"attachment_20808\" align=\"\" width=\"1024\"] Trinity Delta In-Ear Headphones (image: Ewan Spence)[/caption]This sound quality comes from the engineering inside each monitor. Following the lead of high-end monitors, the Trinity Delta uses a balanced armature transducer to create the sound. This can be tuned more accurately in the factory to give a clear reproduction, but it a much quieter solution than using a dynamic driver to reproduce the sound - which is louder but less accurate in terms of reproduction. Most high-end monitors will use multiple armatures to boost the volume, but in the case of the Delta, there is one armature per monitor that is paired up with a dynamic driver to offer clarity of the former with the cost saving of the latter.It's a great combination, especially if you listen to more delicate music that needs that clear reproduction, but as always the limiting factor (especially in mobile) is the quality of the compressed music file rather than the hardware. That said, once you pay attention to the difference between the Trinity Delta and a basic set of OEM in-ear headphones, there is a clear difference in terms of quality.[caption id=\"attachment_20811\" align=\"\" width=\"1024\"] Trinity Delta In-Ear Headphones (image: Ewan Spence)[/caption]Trinity are not going for the ultimate in reproduction. Instead the company is looking to provide a high quality experience at a reasonable cost. Priced at $130/£90 this package certainly delivers on the sound front. Choose the tips well and you can get very close to isolating just the music. Couple that with the armature/driver combination and Trinity delivers on the promise of great sound for under £100.
