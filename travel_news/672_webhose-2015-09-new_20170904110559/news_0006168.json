What led to them, when will the airport open, has anyone been convicted?” \nThe guide took a deep breath and began to explain serious technical flaws — especially in the fire safety and smoke extraction system which must be able to alert both “flames in an ashtray and flames spreading through the terminal”. \n“We had an architect who wasn’t a technician,” he added. “And politicians did not pay close enough attention to who was doing what.” \nBut the problems seem to be too complex for an afternoon stroll. There is no mention of the manager in charge of the ventilation system who was convicted last October of taking bribes, or of the recent bankruptcy of a major contractor at the site, the German division of Dutch group Royal Imtech. \nThe official opening is now slated for late 2017, although locals say they will believe it when they see it. Guessing the actual inauguration date has become a kind of parlour game in the German capital. \nBeyond bus tours, visitors can also sign up for year-round bicycle rides at the site, or a half-marathon in the spring across the wind-swept runways. \nA 41-year-old civil servant who gave her name as Dorothea joined colleagues on a team outing to the airport armed with a selfie stick. \n“It is rather embarrassing that it is taking so long,” she said. “We wanted to take a look to see if we could figure out what the hold-up is.” \nGhost train \nMoving on, the tour came to empty lifts quietly shuttling up and down between the departures floor and an underground rail station where a “ghost” train makes the trip into the city centre a few times a day. \nNeither carry passengers; they must simply keep moving to avoid falling apart. \nA 61-year-old health practitioner named Heidi noted the absurdity of a giant, expensive sculpture of a flying carpet suspended from the ceiling and gathering dust while money poured into the perpetual construction site. \n“I wanted to see this chaos for myself,” she said. \n“We’ve become a country where big projects just don’t seem to work, whether it’s BER or the concert hall in Hamburg,” she said, referring to a similarly long-delayed and wildly over-budget prestige project. \nManfred Mattick, 73, a retired Berlin government worker, came to the tour with his young grandson, whom he called “an airport enthusiast”. \nHe described the debacle at BER as “rather embarrassing for a country that claims to be a global leader in industry”. \nMattick had his own theories about what had gone so terribly wrong. \n“I think the architect had an ambitious vision of a light, airy palace and the technology was supposed to play along. Unfortunately that’s not how buildings work, certainly not airports,” he said. \nGroth, the Austrian, said later that she found the answers given during the tour convincing but wished the guide had been more forthcoming. \n“He should have broached the subject himself,” she said. \n“There’s been a lack of transparency from the beginning here and sometimes you have to take the initiative in explaining to people what happened.” — AFP More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T06:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T13:54:56.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
