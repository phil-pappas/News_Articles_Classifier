Driving from Willcox to Apache Pass is an excellent way to explore part of it. From the start, you’ll see what the area is known for: mountains pushing up from grasslands, agave leaning on the hillsides.\nAgave was an important part of the diet of Apaches, who traveled through here often — so often that they eventually clashed with U.S. troops at a pass between the Dos Cabezas and Chiricahua mountains. The government built a fort here, the remains of which are preserved at Fort Bowie National Historic Site.\nYou can make the trip in just about any kind of vehicle, although the last 10 miles or so are on a graded gravel road. Things to check out along the way:\nRex Allen Arizona Cowboy Museum and Willcox Cowboy Hall of Fame: Dedicated to Willcox native Rex Allen, a famous singing cowboy of records, movies and television, the museum has a theater, gift shop and memorabilia of local history.\nDetails: 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays. 150 S. Railroad Ave., Willcox. 520-384-4583, www.rexallenmuseum.org .\nApache Pass: About 5 miles after you turn onto Apache Pass Road, you’ll come to the pass itself. Parts of this area are marked with signs, and you can park your car and walk on parts of the Butterfield stagecoach route, which is just a narrow path today. The views are nice; the terrain is all desert, so take lots of water. Much of the conflict that took place near this historic pass occurred down the road at Fort Bowie.\nFort Bowie National Historic Site: A fairly easy 3-mile round-trip hike takes you past a stagecoach stop and small cemetery to the old fort. Signs mark places where skirmishes and negotiations between Apaches and U.S. soldiers took place, and a museum and visitor center sits at the top of the hill near the ruins of the fort. Here, too, you will catch nice views.\nDetails: Free. 520-847-2500, www.nps.gov/fobo .\nDon’t miss: In Benson, about 34 miles west of Willcox, the Singing Wind Bookshop has an impressive selection of titles about the Southwest. Book lovers will not want to miss this store, which occupies an old ranch house and has been written up in national publications. Get off Interstate 10 at Exit 304 and take Ocotillo Road north 2.1 miles, then turn right at Singing Wind Road. The shop is a half mile ahead on the left.\nDetails: 9 a.m.-5 p.m. daily. 520-586-2425.\nMiles: About 440, round trip. From central Phoenix, take Interstate 10 east through Tucson to Willcox. At Exit 336, take the frontage road into downtown Willcox, then Arizona 186 south about 31 miles to the signed turnoff to Apache Pass Road and go about 10 miles to Fort Bowie.", "external_links": ["http://www.nps.gov/fobo"], "published": "2015-09-25T15:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T18:18:37.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
