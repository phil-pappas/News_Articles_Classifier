Each and every one of you truly deserve the recognition you have received from our voters around the world. “With such a wonderful inauguration, the World Spa Awards will return next year, bigger and better than ever.” The World Spa Awards is a new and dynamic awards programme for 2015, whose aim is to drive up standards within the spa industry by rewarding the organisations that are leaders in their field. The event was launched by the World Travel Awards, currently celebrating its 22nd anniversary, which already successfully runs the World Ski Awards and the World Golf Awards. World Spa Awards was developed in reaction to overwhelming demand from the spa industry for a programme that was fair and transparent; a programme with a mission to serve as the definitive benchmark of excellence, and to help foster a new era of growth in spa tourism.
