The Corona Discharge Gas Plasma Disassociation System™ (CO2 device) can also be adapted to gas vents used in refineries, exhaust stacks for incinerators, and implemented in more than 100 other common uses.\nSALT LAKE CITY , Sept. 25, David G. Yurth, principal inventor and co-founder of Nova Institute of Technology, a privately-owned research and development group located in Salt Lake City, Utah, announced today the successful testing of The Corona Discharge Gas Plasma Disassociation System™ (CDGPDS™), a compact, lightweight, low-cost energy efficient device that eradicates all exhaust fumes produced by internal combustion engines before they leave the tailpipe.\nStates Yurth: \"The CO2 device can be retrofitted to every internal combustion engine on the planet. The device can also be adapted for use in gas vents used in refineries, exhaust stacks for incinerators, and more than 100 other common uses.\"\nCDGPDS™ incorporates proprietary plasma generating devices with high speed switching circuits to create what is known as a fracturing field inside a pulsating plasma chamber located within the exhaust system. The fracturing field breaks down or \"dissociates\" carbon dioxide and other pollutants within the device itself, thus eliminating the problem before it manifests.\n\"The challenge with dissociating carbon dioxide is that unlike most other three-atom gas molecules, CO2 is a very stable gas,\" says Yurth. \"We have succeeded in demonstrating virtually 100% efficiency in the dissociation process because we have been able to propagate what is known as non-linear dissonance in the plasma chamber.\"\nStates Dr. Michael Kralik , Senior Physicist and Chief Science Officer for Nova: \" Carbon dioxide molecules behave according to a well-known set of harmonic resonances which generate the fields that attract and bind the oxygen atoms to the central carbon atom. By subjecting the gas to intensely dissonant field effects, we are able to disrupt the spin polarity and oscillation frequencies that bind the atoms together.\"\nAccording to Yurth and Kralik, the search for a solution to the production and release of carbon dioxide and other potent greenhouse gases has been the target of intensive research for more than 40 years.\n\"The stability of the CO2 molecule has resisted other attempts to break it down using a long list of excitation technologies, including microwaves, radio frequency pulses, lasers, electromagnetic fields, and various plasma field effects,\" says Yurth. \"Thus far, the scientific literature has reported only nominal success using these methods under carefully controlled laboratory conditions.\"\nThe CO2 device is the result of Nova' s joint technology development arrangement with Collier Group, LLC and SaviCorp, a publicly traded supplier of the DynoValve® family of automotive products since 2004.\nStates Kevin Collier , CEO of Collier Group: \"The system developed by Nova's design engineers can be retrofitted to the tailpipe of the exhaust system and powered by less than 20 amps of current. When we manufacture and distribute these units for mass consumption in the automotive after-market installation and retail outlets, no modifications to the vehicle's electrical system will be required. The Nova system will be compact, lightweight, low cost, and very energy efficient.\"\nNova Institute of Technology LLC is a privately-owned Research and Development group specializing in system integration, prototype testing, and leading edge technology development for itself and selected strategic partners.
