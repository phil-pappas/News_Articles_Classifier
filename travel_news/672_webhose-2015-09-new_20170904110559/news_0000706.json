The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) predict India has potential to become the world’s number one tourist destination with demand growing at 10.1% per annum, while the Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI) report that the current supply of 200,000 hotel rooms in India in 2015 needs to increase by 50% to reach a total of over 300,000 rooms to meet demand. \nA new report by TOPHOTELPROJECTS for The Food & Hotel Show New Delhi forecasts 199 hotel projects and 35,665 rooms are currently under construction in India. \nChristine Davidson, Group Event Director of the dmg events hospitality portfolio including The Hotel Show Dubai and The Hotel Show Saudi Arabia said: “With India still facing a shortfall of 100,000 hotel rooms, it is clear that there is a vital need for a high-quality international forum to connect hospitality buyers and decision-makers with suppliers, promote information sharing and networking. As an organiser of industry-leading events, we will bring our tried and tested and successful hospitality brand together with food in The Food & Hotel Show New Delhi, providing global businesses supplying products to hotels and restaurants with the best possible direct route to the Indian market.” \n“FHRAI identified a total 8,707 hotels and 12,750 restaurants in the Indian market at present,” continued Davidson. “The majority of rooms are 5-star and many are foreign brands including Marriott, Starwood and Accor. As the industry continues to grow at a fast pace, it is now considered as one of the most lucrative and profitable in the Indian market, contributing a significant amount of foreign exchange to the economy.

For the first time foreign travellers can apply for a Visa from home, rather than having to visit an Indian Embassy. The effect of the new eTV scheme has been drastic with a reported 1209% increase in tourists from January 2014 to January 2015. The Government recently announced the number of countries currently able to apply for this visa will be increased to 180 using a phased approach. \nAccording to the Ministry of Tourism, India currently ranks 11th in the world for international tourist arrivals, and has been ranked as 4th most preferred travel destination by The Lonely Planet in 2015. Davidson continued: “The potential in the India tourism and hospitality market is unparalleled. We will introduce The Food & Hotel Show New Delhi and popular knowledge forum the Vision Conference as the ultimate platforms to network, invest and gain insight.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T21:50:49.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
