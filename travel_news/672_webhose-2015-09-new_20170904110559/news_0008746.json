Bangkok, Thailand, September 05, 2015 --( PR.com )-- The ‘Bridge Over the River Kwai’ tour is a 3 day adventure starting from Bangkok and heading to the beautiful area surrounding Kanchanaburi. The tour starts with a transfer from Bangkok to the famous bridge (which is crossed on foot), from where the cycling begins. Riding through attractive countryside, initially alongside the river, a stop is made at one of the war cemeteries. From here the route continues through farmland, towards the end of the ride following the very railway lines that the Allied POWs laid decades before.The following day takes riders along increasingly narrower roads and trails, through a forested landscape. At the end of the day’s biking a ride in the support van completes the journey up to the Hellfire Pass, and its fascinating museum. The day is completed with a spin on the ‘Death Railway’ back to Kanchanaburi.The final day includes a pleasant ride through villages and farmland to the Angkorian ruins of Muang Sing, the furthest point west that the Angkor kingdom reached. Following the visit to the archaeological site a transfer brings guests back to their hotels in Bangkok.Both nights of this tour are spent at the wonderful Boutique Rafts Resort outside Kanchanaburi, and all meals are included during the tour. As with all Grasshopper tours the trip is fully supported by a charming English speaking guide, and a support vehicle is always on hand for those who need a rest from cycling. Snacks, fruit and clean drinking water are provided during riding to keep cyclists refreshed. There is no single supplement for those happy to share with another member of the same sex, although a single supplement is offered for those who prefer their own room.Tour Info", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T10:30:38.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
