Meet by CWT M&E contains all the information organizers or attendees need to plan or navigate through their meeting. It includes meeting details and agenda, and meeting organizers have the ability to email all attendees. Users will also be able to suggest new features which could be added in the future, by using a built-in feedback system.\nMeet by CWT M&E provides attendees of any size meeting or event with tools and functionality that address the end-to-end attendee experience, going well beyond what is typically offered in the events arena.\nThierry Duguet, who oversees CWT Meetings & Events’ global marketing said, “Nearly every businessperson has a smartphone, so apps are an integral part of our lives. With Meet by CWT M&E, we help event and meeting planners ensure increased engagement and a positive meeting experience for delegates. At the same time, we’re making sure their companies are getting better value by making it simple for everyone to make the most of every meeting.”\nCWT Meetings & Events, the meetings and events division of Carlson Wagonlit Travel, initially piloted Meet by CWT in the Nordic region, which is well known for its tech savvy and early adopter behavior. After the successful trial, it is now available for everyone to download from the Apple App Store and Google Play.\nPernilla Andrén, senior director, CWT Meetings & Events, Nordic countries, added, “Event apps have been around for a while, but mostly for big events. We’re now leading the trend towards using them for small and mid-sized meetings. People want to be able to easily access meeting details on their smartphone. Our app means they can do just that.”\nMeet by CWT M&E is fully secure. Users must log on using an email address that is matched to a meeting in the CWT Meetings & Events’ database.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T14:14:39.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
