Organizers would not say how many tickets were being printed or how many were being given to event sponsors.\nThe ticketing fiasco erupted a week after organizers ramped up marketing and unveiled a new slogan, \"I'll Be There,\" to encourage attendance amid fears that months of discussions about tight security had scared people from attending. Hotel bookings, rail pass purchases and charter bus signups have all been far lower than expected.\nFarrell continued the campaign Thursday, calling the parkway the best place in the U.S. to see Francis — even if that view is partially obscured by trees, fountains and sculptures. Papal events will also be broadcast on 40 huge screens throughout the city for crowds not close to the stage or altar, organizers said.\n\"A huge part of this is the experience, is the pilgrims joining arms and singing and waving their flag, from Toledo, Ohio, and Toledo, Spain,\" Farrell said. \"It's going to be the most joyful experience ever.\"\nOrganizers said they would make 10,000 tickets available to the general public for each of the parkway events through a website on a first-come-first-served basis starting Sept. 9.\nThey also said they are doubling, to 10,000, the number of tickets being made available to the public to attend Francis' Sept. 26 speech at Independence Hall on immigration and religious freedom. Those tickets will be available online beginning Tuesday. The rest of the tickets for that event were previously set aside for parishes that serve mostly immigrants.\nTickets for the closing ceremony and the Papal Mass are being allotted to the 219 Catholic parishes in the Philadelphia area based on the size of their congregations.\nLimited supplies are being given to surrounding dioceses in New Jersey, Delaware and other parts of Pennsylvania and to other faith communities and church social service programs, including a program that works with Philadelphia's homeless.\nThe diocese in Allentown, about an hour's drive north of Philadelphia, reported receiving just 400 tickets for its 275,000 members.\nThe churches and dioceses will decide how to dole out the tickets, organizers said. Some plan on using a lottery system. Tickets that aren't used will be reallocated to parishes that run out.\nOrganizers said ticketholders will only account for about 15 percent of the expected crowd on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway.\nChurch officials have estimated that as many as 1.5 million people will attend the papal Mass.\nThe pope's Philadelphia visit will close out his first trip to the U.S. after stops in Washington and New York. All the papal events in those cities will also be ticketed, including a newly added procession through Central Park.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show the non-ticketed area will be about 2 ½ blocks from the pope, not five blocks.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T06:26:08.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
