This initiative, a first for Travel + Leisure, reflects a growing trend in the publishing industry to bridge the gap between content and commerce to find new sources of revenue. \nTrip planner The Travel + Leisure Journeys vacations are laid out by the editorial staff at the magazine, along with Black Tomato. They took into account the 8 million readers’ shared interests of interacting with locals, having surprising experiences and getting away from civilization, all frequently cited as the favorite parts of travel by Travel + Leisure’s audience. \nProviding variety, the trips range in length, with the shortest a four-day excursion to Palm Springs, CA for $1,960 per person. The most lengthy travel plan is a $14,175 24-day trip throughout Papua New Guinea, which includes spelunking in limestone caves, a hike through Bosavi Crater and overnight stays at out of the way camps on lands that were once the hunting grounds for the Kosua tribe. \nOther destinations include Croatia, Cuba, Iceland, India, Japan, Morocco, Myanmar, Oman, Spain, Tennessee and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Trips can be booked here . \nPromotional image for Cuba destination \nTravel + Leisure’s October issue will see a 13-page feature on its Journeys, as well as a cover photo of the Erg Chebbi sand dunes in Morocco, one of the spots ventured to in a Travel + Leisure Journeys vacation. \nIn a brand statement, Travel + Leisure editor Nathan Lump said, “I am delighted to be able to offer our audience of passionate travelers the opportunity to book trips that we have crafted with Black Tomato. A genuine reflection of our point of view, these are the places we are most excited about as editors and are the types of experiences we know our readers seek. And what sets Travel + Leisure Journeys apart is that all the itineraries are truly custom to us: This is not a white-labeled product.” \nP romotional image for journey to Canada In April Travel + Leisure reworked its print format to account for its Web site overhaul to better express the title’s content to its passionate and travel-focused readership. For its relaunch, on both Web and in print, Travel + Leisure is exploring different formats that put travel storytelling at the forefront of its content. As Time Inc.’s first truly travel-focused title, since it acquired the publication from American Express Publishing, newly instated editor-in-chief Nathan Lump had the opportunity to revamp the readers’ experience across channels ( see story ). \nMedia group Time Inc. recently invested in peer-to-peer ecommerce network Keaton Row to further increase the transactional nature of its publication, InStyle ( see story ). \nBeyond Time, the media industry is actively courting ecommerce partnerships and initiatives to reach established audiences in a new way. With media company Condé Nast putting the weight of its 140 titles behind an ecommerce venture, it has the potential to alter the playing field for fashion and upscale retail. Previously, individual magazines such as Harper’s Bazaar and Lucky have combined their content with ecommerce, but the publisher represents a broader reach than any of the single publications, joining together all of its advertising affiliations into one ecommerce site. This may set off more competition among fashion retailers for exclusives and specific merchandise, making relationship building all the more important ( see story ).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T21:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T21:18:14.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
