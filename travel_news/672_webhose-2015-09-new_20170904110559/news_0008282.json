The grains fermented and mingled with naturally available yeast, a drinkable spirit was produced, and it beat the heck out of chewing on damp cattails after a hard day of foraging. It was called gruel-beer, and it was considered pretty good — for the time, which was around 10,000 BCE.\nThe Sumerians and Egyptians took things from there, as did Celtic inhabitants of Scotland, people living on the banks of China’s Yellow River, and so on. Essentially, wherever there were abundant grains, there were people; and once people found they could make beer, as well as bread from those grains, they were off to the races, civilization-wise. Beer was easy to make and it made hard work a little easier. Once brewers came to harness the power of the simple recipe of malted grain, water and yeast, and the ways to keep it stable so they could share it beyond the humble home brewery, humanity was awash in choice.\nFor some, it might be too much choice The labels, the types and the flavors can be inscrutable; you wonder if it’s appropriate to talk about a wort in public; you don’t know a Willamette hop from a Cascade. You don’t want to have to join an Illuminati-like society to understand good beer. You’ll stick to the same Deschutes Porter you’ve been drinking since 1992, thank you, although you have no idea if there are any other kinds you might like, let alone explain why you drink it.\nAUTHOR APPEARANCE Jeff Alworth The author of “The Beer Bible” will appear at 6:30 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 10, Book Larder, 4252 Fremont Ave. N., Seattle; free, by reservation (206-397-4271 or booklarder.com ).\nPortlander Jeff Alworth is preaching a gospel you can embrace. His lively new “The Beer Bible,” (Workman, 656 pp., $19.95), patterned after Karen MacNeil’s wildly successful “The Wine Bible,” is an accessible, if doorstop-sized, history of and theory behind the suds we imbibe today. Like the good textbook you kept long after college, “The Beer Bible” is divided into easy-to-digest sections, and each chapter is loaded with graphs, charts and little asides that are the mental equivalent of a snack. (Examples: “Hildegard of Bingen, Hop Mama” and “The Science of Foam.”) It’s made to be sipped in small servings, rather than guzzled.\nMost Read Stories State Supreme Court: Charter schools are unconstitutional Sorry about really messing up Bumbershoot for you kids Seahawks Cutdown Day live thread: Seahawks set initial 53-man roster Seahawks agree to deal with veteran RB Fred Jackson, waive Robert Turbin Green River killer moved to Colorado prison to end isolation Alworth spent two years traveling and tasting, at more than 50 breweries, to produce “The Beer Bible.” It’s more than history and chemistry. It’s a comprehensive trip through the intertwined history and culture of beer and humans. Each has influenced the other. Along with the necessary basics regarding how the major kinds of beers are made and why, Alworth shows readers how to decipher a beer label, taste beer like an expert, pair beer with food and serve it in the right glassware. The chapters on the types of beer — ales, wheat beers, lagers and tart/wild ales — unravel the mysteries behind pub menus, so a reader can order with confidence among the pale ales, cask ales, India pale ales (IPA) or British IPAs. Alworth also introduces readers to prominent breweries of each type of beer, and provides “The beers to know” of each. (Many Northwest breweries are on the lists — no surprise.)\n“Though there’s a huge amount you can learn about beer, the principal experience should be pleasure,” Alworth writes, and his readers will raise a glass to that.\nMelissa Davis: mdavis@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter @melissa_dav", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/melissa_dav", "http://www.workman.com/products/9781563054341/"], "published": "2015-09-04T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T11:16:55.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
