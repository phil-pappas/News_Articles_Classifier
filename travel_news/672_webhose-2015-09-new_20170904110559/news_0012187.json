The ban stemmed from concerns that calls would jam ground stations relaying the calls, but FCC members say that technical problem no longer applies.\nThe advisory panel’s move could rekindle interest – and opposition – in the prospect of in-flight calls after the debate quieted in mid-2014.\nThe four-member panel representing consumers, airlines and airports urged Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx to keep working on mobile-call issues to ensure safety and security.\n“We recommend that if safe and secure, that the Department of Transportation allow airlines to decide whether to permit passengers to use mobile devices for voice calls,” said Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane, who is chairman of the advisory panel.\nThe FCC and DOT haven’t set any schedule to act on the contentious subject.\nThe conflict is between companies eager to provide cellular services during flights and travelers hostile to the prospect of chatty passengers. Flight attendants also raised security concerns if terrorists used cellphones to better coordinate attacks.\nThe FCC decided in December 2013 to collect comment about dropping the in-flight cell ban. Chairman Tom Wheeler told Congress the rationale for the ban no longer applies because planes now carry their own cell towers.\nCompanies such as AeroMobile Communications and OnAir are eager to provide airlines with the equipment so that phone companies such as Verizon and AT&T provide service and bill customers as with international calling.\nDozens of foreign airlines offer cellular service including calls, which supporters say demonstrates the safety. Providers say calls are typically short – a couple of minutes – and that customers often use silent functions such as email or entertainment. The service must be turned off within 250 miles of the United States.\nThe Transportation Department also collected comment about whether to regulate cellular service on flights in case the FCC dropped its ban.\nThe FCC got 1,400 comments and DOT nearly 1,800 comments before deadlines in mid-2014. Opposition to calls was nearly unanimous; messages ranged from hand-scrawled diatribes to multi-page rants.\nThe House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee voted in February 2014 on legislation to ban mobile calls on flights.\n72 CONNECT 17 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 5 //usat.ly/1FgNSx8 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://usat.ly/1FgNSx8", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1FgNSx8&text=Airlines%20should%20decide%20whether%20to%20allow%20in-flight%20calls%2C%20panel%20says&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3a9b474b823e95309ffea6f2342ce3eccbf2a07b/c=0-0-908-683&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/635767090935568570-AP-CELLPHONES-PLANES-67919448.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1FgNSx8&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/635767090935568570-AP-CELLPHONES-PLANES-67919448.JPG"], "published": "2015-09-01T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T05:26:57.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
