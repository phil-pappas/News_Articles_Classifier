He said, no, he went to his parents' anniversary celebrations. They went out for dinner. I think that's great. The players and the coaches will have analysed the heck out of England this week and the team will watch so much rugby. Those times when you can just get away from the whole camp set-up and rugby in general are priceless. Getting back with the family is so important. It can't be underestimated. Sam has deep, close bonds with his family, and will draw strength from that. For some players, and certainly for Sam, that is key to being on-song on the field and delivering. I don't text Sam before and after every game, but I'll text him on Saturday morning. I usually text Sam after a game, win or lose. I think I've been able to pass on things to Sam and support him away from rugby more than anything. There have been a couple of rough times for Sam – getting red-carded and getting some criticism now and again about his form. I've just been there to offer him some comfort. I haven't offered him much technical advice – how to tackle somebody or how to steal a ball in the contact area – because Sam doesn't need me to tell him how to do that. It's just the other stuff really. The world ends after Saturday. And that will be the mindset of Sam Warburton We played six and seven together a lot during his early years at Cardiff. You try to help any young player coming in, regardless of their position. I'm 14 years older than Sam and that's a massive age difference. But I knew he was going to take my spot as soon as he walked in. Since I've retired it's just been the odd chat here and there to offer a little bit of support. He doesn't need a hell of a lot because he's so level-headed. He's not one of these mentally fragile individuals who needs constant reassuring. He's got a great family around him and a great support network. I'm just somebody who has been through what he's been through. I used to get advice from the older players I played with and again it wasn't so much technical stuff but more to do with stuff away from the game. On the pressures of fame When you're successful in Wales, it's probably one of the best places in the world to be successful at sport. It's such a small country and everyone is so supportive. When you're winning, it's an amazing place to play rugby and be part of your national team. It's intense and passionate. But, on the flipside of that, it can be the worst place in the world as well – when you lose. You speak to some of the English boys or the Australians and it's different. When you're living in London, the players can walk down the street and they'll go unrecognised, the majority of the players. They can get away with things when they're living in England. When you're in Wales, you can't get away from it. You pop to your local supermarket or local coffee shop and you can guarantee somebody will be there and somebody will say something to you. It's all well and good when you're getting patted on the back for a fantastic win on the Saturday, but it's not a pleasant experience when you've had a big loss or haven't played well. Unless you've been through that experience as a player, it's very difficult to give advice to people on that front. You learn yourself how to deal with it. I've seen players – and I've done it – get carried away after a couple of good wins and think they are invincible. But it quickly turns back around. Sam has a nickname: 'Space Cadet'. He's able to go off in his own mind and deal with everything You've got to keep that level head all the way through it. Sam's been fantastic from day one really, but I think there have been times when he may have struggled. Those times are when you need people you trust, and who care about you. It will be a long day for them Saturday with an 8pm kick off. Sam is very relaxed on game day. Somebody like Jamie Roberts likes to get out and have a coffee and meet up with friends or family. Because it's such a late kick off, some might do that. They might have the opportunity to pop to their local coffee shop or meet their family. I didn't want to see anybody other than the team-mates really. You're in camp, you're in match-day mode. It's a very individual process. We had a nickname for Sam: “Space Cadet”. He's able to go off in his own mind and deal with everything. Sam's a very intelligent guy, very level-headed. But the fact that he's so laid-back and doesn't get ruffled by anything... he's in his own little world, he's very articulate. The way he deals with good and bad pressure is admirable. He's dealt with it fantastically. He seems to enjoy the press. He's grown into the role of captain. I know he's very quiet as a captain, and he wasn't that comfortable with the role at first, but three or four years down the line it's second nature to him. On the atmosphere in camp In Wales, a Six Nations game between England and Wales will be watched by the entire country. But this game is on another level. The interest is staggering. Every facet is being analysed, and within camp – every minute detail from the coaches, the physios, the backroom staff – will come into play. It's a huge support network. The coaches don't have to play it down but they have to remind the players to forget the occasion and just do the job. The beauty of that coaching team – Warren, Neil, Rob, Shaun – is that they've all been there. They've all played at the highest level. They relate to the pressure out there. They'll know intimately what the players will be feeling. They've got a huge job, not only playing it down, but giving a few little snippets to certain individuals to get the best out of them. We are a better team when we are underdogs and this coaching group has a knack of getting good performances out of us in the really big games. He's a big game player, Sam; the bigger the game, the better he plays. He'll definitely go up a couple of notches. This week has been different because Wales travelled up to London. They are in a proper camp. Last week in Cardiff they had a few days back with the family. This week will feel like the start of the World Cup. You're away, you're cut off from everyone. Last week they knew they'd beat Uruguay and knew it was just a case of by how many. They'll be approaching this thinking there's nothing after this Saturday. Whatever happens after those 80 minutes, forget about it. The world ends after Saturday. And that will be the mindset of Sam Warburton. • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T18:41:20.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
