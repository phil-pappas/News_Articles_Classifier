Photographer's Note \n Santiago de Chile - 1973  A journey to another country is also a confrontation with its history and sometimes with some very dark pages of the history. A visit of Chile and more specifically of Santiago is inextricably linked to the memories of the coup détat in September, 1973 , now 42 years ago, and to the following very difficult years. Today I show three pictures that refer to that period. While in the early '70s in Europe different countries regained their democracy - Greece in 1973, Portugal in 1974 and Spain in 1975  several countries in South America remained plagued by military juntas. However for decades Chile had been hailed as a beacon of democracy and political stability. This came to an end on September, 11th, 1973, by one of the most violent coups in Latin America. On that day the elected government of Salvador Allende was overthrown by the Chilean army and the national police. On the main picture you see the presidential palace, called La Moneda , that was bombed by the Chilean Air Force. The military junta declared that Allende committed suicide but a report of a former military justice official that was found in 2010 made assume that the president was assassinated. 40.000 political opponents of the new regime were put in prison in the Estadio Nacional de Chile in Santiago which had been turned into an ad hoc concentration camp. In the three years after the coup around 130.000 people were arrested. Approximately 3.000 opponents of the new regime were murdered, often after torture, or disappeared under suspicious circumstances. general Augusto Pinochet was appointed as head of a provisional government junta. At the end of 1974 he became president. The dictatorship lasted until October, 5th, 1988 when an (internationally supported) referendum in Chile eventually removed him from power. You can read more at the pictures of the Memorial del Detenido Desaparecido y del Ejecutado Político and the Museo de la Memoria y los Derechos Humanos in the workshop. Museo de la Memoria y los Derechos Humanos (Museum of Memory and Human Rights) . . Its mission is to allow dignity for victims and their families, stimulate reflection and debate and to promote respect and tolerance in order that these events never happen again. http://www.museodelamemoria.cl/ Also two European countries were mentioned: the former Yugoslavia during the breakup in the 1990s and the German Democratic Republic (DDR) between 1949 and 1990. \n, ikeharel has marked this note useful", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T11:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T13:51:15.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
