At that time, my ex and I ran a vintage shop in Manchester, selling everything from clothes to furniture and knick-knacks. We got most of our stock from junk shops and warehouses, and that meant regular trips across the Pennines to Yorkshire to bag bargains. After one especially successful expedition we filled our fairly clapped-out people carrier (something of a vintage piece in itself) with all sorts of treasures – so much so that there was barely room for us. As well as the bundles of vintage clothes, we had picked up two carved Victorian bar stools and a life-size naked mannequin. Eventually everything was squeezed in and we set off. Up on the windy moors, our old people carrier spluttered, slowed and stopped... Before long it started to pour, and as we climbed the winding roads up the hills the weather got progressively worse. And then the inevitable happened. Just as we reached pretty much the middle of nowhere, up on the windy moors, our old people carrier spluttered, slowed and stopped. We had broken down. I phoned the AA and they arranged for a patrol to come and rescue us as soon as possible. They also told us that we should not wait in the car – for fear that another motorist might collide with us – but instead wait outside, on what passed for a hard shoulder up there. We duly hauled out our Victorian bar stools, set them up next to the car and, to protect us from the worst of the weather, wrapped ourselves in some of the clothes we had bought: huge 1930s overcoats and the widest hats we could find. The whole scene must have looked like something out of some surreal Gothic horror film And there we sat in the deluge, getting soaked to the skin. I can’t help thinking the whole scene must have looked like something out of some surreal Gothic horror film. God only knows what passing motorists must have thought as they drove by – there we were, perched on our stools in the rain, dressed like some sort of pre-war vaudeville act, while rammed up against the back windscreen of our car was the mannequin, looking for all the world like the corpse of a naked woman. The only consolation was the look on the face of the AA man when he did arrive – and I can’t help feeling we at least gave him a good story to tell his mates. • With the AA on your side, you're covered no materr what happens on the road.
