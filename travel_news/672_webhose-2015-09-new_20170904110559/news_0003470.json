Traditional physic garden at UBC offers a glimpse into history of folk medicine \nOn a sightseeing flight from Nimpo Lake to Hunlen Falls n B.C.’s west Chilcotin region , you’ll see snow-tipped mountains, ice fields, forested valleys and turquoise lakes. One thing you won’t see is much evidence of human habitation. \nThis part of the province is home to bears, eagles, salmon and wolves but very few people. Only a couple hundred live in the Nimpo Lake area and about two thousand live further west in the expansive Bella Coola Valley . \nThat’s why, for decades, it has been a cherished retreat for vacationers who value nature and solitude more than the attractions and amenities of a big city. The only mystery is, why aren’t more of them here? \nOne answer might be accessibility. The region is just over an hour’s flight from Vancouver on a small twin-engine plane, but a 10-to 12-hour drive. And don’t even ask about BC Ferries service – the cancellation earlier this year of the Discovery Coast ferry from Port Hardy to Bella Coola is a major sore point for local residents. (Passengers now have to transfer in coastal Bella Bella to a bare-bones 16-car ferry that takes nine hours to make its way up the inlet to Bella Coola.) \nBut get there if you can. You can plan as active or as lazy a vacation as you want, all while feeling like you have stepped into one of those “ super , natural ” television commercials promoting B.C. to the world. \nOne of the main reasons the area has remained pristine is because the province set aside more than 950,000 hectares of the valley in 1938 as Tweedsmuir Provincial Park . In terms of accommodation, its crown jewel is Tweedsmuir Park Lodge , which has 11 very comfortable chalets nestled in the spectacular Coast Mountains. \nThe lodge is an excellent base for exploring the region, especially since it has several packages of day trips ranging from hiking and fishing in the summer to heli-skiing in the winter. If you’re keen on taking a grizzly bear tour, visit from early May to mid-June or mid-August to mid-October when they are most likely to be spotted. Even if you don’t see a grizzly, a summer or fall visit to the park offers a wide range of activities. \nTake a scenic drift down the Atnarko River and let your guide do all the rowing while you look for bald eagles and other wildlife. For something a bit more adventurous, book a guided heli-hiking tour high in the mountains, flying over ice fields and mountain lakes on the way. \nIf float planes are more your speed, Tweedsmuir Air Services runs sightseeing tours from Nimpo Lake to Turner Lake, where you can hop off and hike up to Hunlen Falls. This relatively easy hike takes about an hour round-trip, and its highlight is a spectacular view of the 260-metre-high falls and the river valley beneath it. \nOn the way there and back, you’ll see signs of nature at work. You’ll see the ravages wrought by forest fires and pine-beetle infestations, but also signs of the forest’s ability to recuperate from such calamities as new-growth pine and spruce trees poke up between the grey trunks. \nFirst Nations make up about half the population of the Bella Coola Valley, and you can learn a lot about their history and culture in two highly recommended guided hikes. \nBetween Bella Coola and Hagensborg, Walker Island Park offers more than a stroll through an old-growth forest. Guide Doug Baker can point out trees where bark has been stripped off in long sections for use in making traditional hats, masks and other First Nations crafts (when done expertly, the trees live to tell the tale). Other trees were hollowed out to create natural smokers for fish or meat. \nNear Bella Coola, Chris Nelson, a member of the Nuxalk First Nation, leads a tour to the petroglyphs at Thorsen Creek for his guiding company, Copper Sun Journeys . After a short hike up a wooded trail that rises alongside the creek, the petroglyphs come into view, carved deep into the rocks. With help from a tribal elder, Nelson explains the stories told by the faces and figures, which are thought to date back 5,000 to 10,000 years and hold deep spiritual significance for the Nuxalk people. \nNelson also runs the Copper Sun Gallery in Bella Coola, which features the work of many of the talented Nuxalk artists. \nParts of the valley feel like a trip back in time. That sensation is particularly strong just across the inlet from Bella Coola at the Tallheo Cannery , where fish haven’t been processed and packed since 1947, when refrigeration put it out of business. Jim Newkirk, who used to work as a mechanic at the cannery, bought the property in 1990 and eight years later, he opened the Tallheo Cannery Guest House on the site. Now his son Garrett and daughter-in-law Skye run a comfortable 12-bedroom guest house – once a boarding house for some of the Norwegian girls who worked at the cannery. \nThe trip to the cannery starts and ends at the boat harbour in Bella Coola. Also launching from the harbour is a day trip up the South Bentinck Arm off Burke Channel with Leonard Ellis of Bella Coola Grizzly Tours and Adventure Resort . On board his boat, visitors might spot seals and dolphins in the water, and bears and wolves on shore. \nAfter a cruise by a cascading waterfall, Ellis made a stop at a natural hot springs nestled in a cliff above the water. You can choose a grotto-like cave or a more exposed pool on the edge of the cliff. \nPlan a quick stop at Bella Coola Valley Seafoods , where Ed and Sandy Wilson brine and smoke freshly caught salmon. Their candied chum salmon is a top seller, but their newest product, spring salmon jerky, could give it a run for its money. \nBack home, don’t be surprised if you find yourself daydreaming about the natural splendour of B.C.’s central coast. That’s why the effort to get there is worth it. \nThe writer was a guest of Destination British Columbia.
