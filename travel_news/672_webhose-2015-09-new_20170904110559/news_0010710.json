Since the early days of Sin City, comedians have flocked to this desert oasis to ply their trade. Such luminaries as Jerry Lewis, Milton Berle and Red Foxx sold out shows in major showrooms every time they performed. While stand-up comedy was mostly a boy’s club back then (save for such geniuses as Phyllis Diller and Joan Rivers), it’s now just a matter of who is funniest, regardless of the comic’s sex. To show Las Vegas vacationers the truth of that statement, Starpoint Resort Group has put together this list of the top three funniest female comics to catch in Las Vegas this September.\nWhitney Cummings: Audiences may have seen this acerbic comic on her NBC show \"Whitney\" or when she’s hilariously ripped into stars on a Comedy Central Roast. Whitney Cummings, who also created CBS' hit comedy \"2 Broke Girls,\" has sharpened her tongue and wit for a night of stand-up comedy at the Lipshtick Comedy Series at the Venetian on Sept. 19. Starpoint Resort Group shares that Cummings has written for and starred a number of television shows and movies, including 2015’s “The Wedding Ringer.”\nWanda Sykes: Ranked among Entertainment Weekly's 25 Funniest People in America, Wanda Sykes is both a successful comedian and actress. People on vacation in Las Vegas can catch her set on Sept. 25 at the Mystère Theatre at Treasure Island. Starpoint Resort Group shares that Sykes has been nominated for and won multiple awards throughout her career: seven Primetime Emmy nominations with one win for \"Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Special\"; the American Comedy Award for \"Outstanding Female Stand Up Comic\"; and a Comedy Central Commie Award for \"Funniest TV Actress in 2003” among others.\nLisa Lampanelli: People on a Sin City vacation will be hard pressed to find a comedian who more hilariously crosses the line than Lisa Lampanelli. She’s been called a combination of Don Rickles and Archie Bunker. Her style of humor was influenced by the Dean Martin roasts. She has said in the past that she watched those as she was growing up and didn’t start watching other stand-up comics until she became one herself. Starpoint Resort Group says audiences can catch Lampanelli at the Venitian on Sept. 26.\nWhen people travel to Las Vegas with Starpoint Resort Group, they get the best in accommodations, amenities and customer service.
