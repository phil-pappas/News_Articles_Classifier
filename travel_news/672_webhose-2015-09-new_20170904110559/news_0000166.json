It will manufacture tailor-made polyurethane materials for the region, and is based at the group’s existing acrylic coatings products plant.\nThese products are used in energy-efficient residential, construction and industrial applications. Products range across infrastructure maintenance and consumer comfort in flooring, furniture and footwear. They include rigid, semi-rigid and flexible foams, adhesives, sealants, coatings, elastomers and binders.\nThe Durban systems house is part of about 20 such hubs globally — including in the US, China, European Union, Russia, Brazil and India. These will be supplied by Dow’s giant new $20bn Sadara feedstock facility being built in Saudi Arabia. The group currently imports feedstock out of Europe and the US for such hubs. But Sadara should start supplying polyurethane building blocks from late 2016.\nDow group vice-president for polyurethane solutions Jonathan Penrice said on Wednesday that polyurethane markets differed widely across countries such as China, Germany and SA, according to local legislation.\n\"Building regulations around the world differ significantly,\" he said.\n\"That creates subtle technical differences that we need to respond to.\"\nHe said Dow had about 100 polyurethane customers in SA. By producing locally, product lead times would be cut back and issues around product shelf-life would be better facilitated.\n\"We are looking to double or triple (the number of customers) with this new facility,\" he said.\nHe also said Dow was establishing a large logistics facility in Durban port to import the feedstock from Saudi Arabia.\nMeanwhile, exports of polyurethane products across sub-Saharan Africa would be facilitated by Durban’s worldwide ocean transport networks.\n\"The local needs for more energy efficient houses and food transportation can be met with our global innovations tailored to local market needs,\" commercial leader of sub-Saharan Africa for Dow Polyurethane Mohammed Sami said on Wednesday.\nHe said that Dow’s \"highly efficient and practical insulation materials\" reduced energy consumption, energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions for homes, buildings, refrigerated trucks and supermarket shelves.\nSA is prioritising energy efficiency, as an insulated room needs 51% less energy to heat up than one that is not, according to research by struggling national electricity utility Eskom.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:30:40.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
