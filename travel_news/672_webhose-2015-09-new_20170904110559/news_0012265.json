It is expected to pass over the north-western portion of the island chain later Monday. It is not expected to strengthen much before Monday night.\nAs of 8 a.m. ET, Fred was about 40 miles west of Rabil in the Cape Verde Islands, which are situated roughly 400 miles west of Dakar, Senegal.\nForecasters reminded islanders that wind speeds can increase 30% on the peaks and windward sides of hills and mountains.\nIt’s unclear if the hurricane will make it to the Caribbean or United States, as Fred is forecast to experience gradual weakening beginning Tuesday.\nFred is expected to bring 4 to 6 inches of rain to the Cape Verde Islands with the possibility of up to 10 inches in isolated areas, which could result in flash flooding and mudslides, the weather service warned.\nFred is the latest storm to cause concern in recent days. Erika was downgraded from a tropical storm on Saturday, but not before killing at least 20 people on the Caribbean island of Dominica, which saw a foot of rain in 10 hours, according to CNN meteorologist Chad Myers.\nTorrential rains sent floodwater rushing over the banks of Dominica’s rivers and streams. Erika also swept away people who are still missing, authorities said.\nIn the Pacific, forecasters warned Hawaiians to keep track of Hurricane Ignacio. The 115-mph Category 3 storm was located about 500 miles east of Honolulu as of the latest advisory from the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. Ignacio is predicted to pass east and northeast of the main Hawaiian islands this week.\nMeanwhile, an even stronger storm, Hurricane Jimena, was located about 1,400 miles east of Hilo, Hawaii, early Monday which was moving west-northwest at about 17 mph.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T00:07:14.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
