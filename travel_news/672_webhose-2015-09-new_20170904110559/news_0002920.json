Another marketing challenge can also be making itineraries from scratch.\nIn my research on the technologies available I was very privileged to come across, an emerging company itself that is focusing on a high technology low cost product for itinerary creation.\nTravefy is free and very intuitive with many great features, as its free I do not need to extol the virtues at length, I believe 30 mins of your time to try the program will make you a believer. On behalf of IAGTO members I have negotiated a 10% reduction for the paid travel agent version of Travefy, this version is very much in reach of the smaller company and allows for Logo and price to be shown. Simply use the promotion code BILL10 when you sign up for a 10% discount.\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T18:48:11.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
