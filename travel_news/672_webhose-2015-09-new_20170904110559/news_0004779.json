The tournament comprises 12 qualifiers at four first-class courses – Loch Lomond, St George’s Hill, The Grove and Stoke Park – offering great golf and networking opportunities in equal measure. Ten teams of four have already nailed down their spots in the final, to be held at the Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort in Naples, Florida from 18-22 October – and two more will qualify from today’s Srixon Industry Invitational and next Friday’s Sportingclass Open, both at The Grove in Hertfordshire. Srixon, the tournament’s sponsor, is one of the world’s leading developers of golf ball technology, and it brings together club professionals with sponsors and clients for a day out on the links. “Srixon takes them for a nice round of golf in a meaningful tournament as a thank you for their support over the year,” says Andy Lee, the managing director of Sportingclass. “It’s a big day for them.” The organisers are nothing if not fair, so the most recent qualifying tournament at The Grove in Hertfordshire offers a second shot at the final for the 11 runners-up from the previous golf days this year. This year’s highlights A new tournament, the Gaucho Golf Open, was played this month at St George’s Hill in Surrey. The Argentine restaurant group sponsored the day in characteristic style, with food and drink at every hole. “We had 18 teams there and everyone came away saying, ‘Wow, that was just phenomenal,’ ” said Lee. “Gladstone Small (the former England cricketer) was with us for that one. He’s a good player, although he got stuck at the Mojito hole (the 7th) for about half an hour. His golf tailed off a bit after that.” One of the tournament’s stalwarts, Chester King, the chief executive officer of Stoke Park Country Club in Buckinghamshire, has finally made it through to the final after five years of trying. The 16-handicapper was part of the Home House team that won their own golf day – the Home House Open – at Stoke Park in July. “He’s a very competitive man is Chester, and he has been trying to get to the final every year we’ve been doing this,” says Lee. “It’s great to have people who take it so seriously and are keen to do well and make the final.” Next year The 2016 schedule is already being finalised, and golfers can look forward to playing at Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club, venue of the Malaysian Open, one of the leading events on the European Tour. The course has been provisionally booked, with confirmation due in December. The nearby Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur will provide suitably luxurious accommodation for the trophy-chasing golfers.
