China ended six years of mystery surrounding the holdings in July, revealing a 57% jump since 2009 and overtaking Russia to become the country with the fifth-largest stash.\nChina has joined Russia and Kazakhstan in increasing gold assets and is reporting its position monthly, showing a shift towards greater transparency as the country improves data quality, increases its presence in commodities trading and promotes the international role of the yuan. The nation devalued its currency in August and announced a move to a more market-driven exchange-rate mechanism.\n\"It’s just a standard diversification,\" Morgans Financial analyst James Wilson said on Wednesday. \"But it’s an inordinately small amount for the Chinese to be investing in at the moment, and that’s why we say that there should be a much bigger investment in gold from the Chinese purely because of the size of the economy.\"\nChina still has only about 1.6% of its foreign reserves in gold, compared with 73% for the US, 67% for Germany and 65% in France and Italy, World Gold Council data show.\nGold prices have lost about 40% from a record in 2011 and are trading near their lowest level in more than five years.
