The opportunity for six tenancies includes a full service bistro, licensed bar, full service café, gourmet urban fast food, a coffee and light snack offering, and a fast and fresh Asian cuisine, catering to a range of tastes.\nIn keeping with Sydney Airport’s approach to new food and beverage offerings, the selection will ensure passengers can select from a variety of healthy and fresh options across a range of price points.\nSydney Airport general manager retail Glyn Williams said the opportunity for strong operators in the food and beverage industry is exceptional.\n“Since commencing our T1 improvements program in early January, we’ve seen an impressive array of compelling food and beverage operators who recognise the unique opportunity to establish their brand within Australia’s busiest airport. The Pier C Departures RFP is an exciting opportunity to be part of enhancing the food and dining offering at Sydney Airport, providing greater choice and value for passengers,” Mr Williams said.\nSource:- Sydney Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T18:57:06.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
