The latest major operator to enter Iraq is Carlson Rezidor.\nMark Willis, Area Vice President for the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa said this deal took nearly “a year off the table” after exploring many opportunities in the semi-autonomous, oil-rich state of Kurdistan.\n“We see opportunities in a country which has had a difficult last few years,” he said speaking at the signing at the Radisson Blu Dubai Media City on Sunday evening.\nThe 260-room hotel will contain an all-day dining restaurant, speciality restaurant, lobby bar, meeting rooms and ballroom, gym and spa. It will be located in the Western suburbs, 3kms from the airport.\nOther multinational operators like the Sheraton Erbil Hotel, Marriott International and Hilton have already made their entry in Iraq.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T02:08:35.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
