If employees in UK companies are healthier, the whole country will be healthier. More than that, evidence from the Britain’s Healthiest Company awards shows that businesses themselves gain, because their staff are more motivated, take less time off for sickness and are much more productive. I’ve seen this for myself, not least in my role as chair of the Britain’s Healthiest Company advisory group. As the initiative expands, it yields a larger store of data, making it easier to draw conclusions about the health of the nation’s workforce and its impact on output. In 2015, 112 firms took part in Britain's Healthiest Company This year saw by far the largest number of participants in Britain’s Healthiest Company. When the programme was launched in 2013, 38 companies signed up, and 9,500 employee questionnaires were completed. In 2015, 112 companies have been involved and we have analysed data from 32,500 employees. That’s great news, because it shows that a growing number of companies in the UK are taking the health and well-being of their staff seriously. They’re prepared to submit their organisation to scrutiny to sharpen their practice and improve standards. One thing the results reveal is the good work being done across the country to care for employees. Many participants are attentive to mental well-being and resilience, recognising the clear link that exists between this and physical health. Many offer support in the form of exercise classes, subsidised gyms, on-site wellness centres and healthy eating campaigns – all of which are designed to help staff live healthy, active lives. Good work is being done across the country to care for employees But I believe we can achieve even more. I’m struck that half of those questioned admitted to not eating sufficient fruit and veg (five portions per day), while 35 per cent said they don’t take enough exercise. Most importantly, 87 per cent of all participating employees have a Vitality Age that is higher than their actual age, with the average difference being three years and 10 months. By signing up to Britain’s Healthiest Company, employers take an important step to improving such statistics. They receive a detailed anonymised breakdown of employee data for their firm, and can work to establish a culture that puts the health and well-being of employees at its core. In this way, they help improve the health of the nation. This brings far more than a financial benefit. It has to do with the flourishing of our population, and our commitment as a country to establishing the highest standards of public health.
