Last updated 10:37, September 28 2015 SUPPLIED \nAnnette and Clive Swale with Emilia, 3, and Cooper, 5, in the historic city of Colonia del Sacramento. \nWhat inspired your move, and how long have you been there? \nClive was looking for a more senior role and we both wanted to move back to South America – where the children (and us) could learn Spanish and we could further our South American travels that we started while living in Brazil. We have lived in Uruguay for two and a half years. \nWhat do you do there? Kiwi expats: What's your tale? Share your stories, photos and videos. \nClive is a director of learning at The British School and I am a stay-at-home mother and part-time online project researcher. We are both also studying towards further degrees. \nWhat are the greatest advantages to living there? \nThe travel opportunities, and that I get to be a stay-at-home mother to our children, yet still live comfortably on one income. Because Clive works at an international school, we get to take advantage of all the school holidays to travel abroad. \nDisadvantages? It is hard for our family to be away from us and the grandparents to not see as much of their grandchildren. But Skype is great for this and to be honest, I think we see our family even more now that we live abroad. \nClive and Emilia enjoy asado, the South American delicacy otherwise known as barbecue. Image: Supplied \nHow expensive is it compared to New Zealand? How much is a beer? \nSome things are more expensive here, like electricity and imported goods (including cars), which are heavily taxed. When we leave Uruguay we always stock up on items and bring them back – this includes clothes/shoes, toys, electronics, toiletries, cosmetics, books. Beer is bought in one-litre bottles and costs around US$2 per litre. What do you do in your spare time? We love to barbecue at home on our Uruguay-style wood barbecue and have friends over to share it. We also enjoy eating out, camping, travelling and spending time with our friends. Our kids do swimming lessons, taekwondo and ballet as after-school activities so this keeps us busy too. Not to mention that we are busy with our studies and I also run a Q&A blog and website, annettesanswers.blogspot.com and askannette.org. What's the local delicacy and would you recommend eating it? Asado (barbecue) – every restaurant serves it, it is a way of life here and in other South American countries too. It is delicious – you can buy a massive steak for around US$10-15! Ad Feedback \nEasiest way to get around? \nFor us a car is the easiest way to get around but we know many people who do not own cars. There are many taxis and buses. We also love to bike around the suburb we live in – it is flat and there is a rambla (boardwalk) that runs along the coastline of the city. \nWhat's the shopping like? \nThere are six big shopping malls that have a lot of shops. We don't do a great deal of shopping here simply because the price of goods is high. \nBest after-dark activity? \nMicro-breweries are starting to pop up here and Clive has a favourite he likes to go to. Restaurants are also popular – most people eat dinner in Uruguay between 9pm and midnight. You can't even find restaurants open before 7.30pm! There are also many shows and performances at Teatro Solis. \nBest time of year to visit? \nSummer! It is hot and beautiful and a lovely time to explore the country and beautiful beaches. \nWhat are the top three things you recommend for visitors? \nColonia del Sacramento – a colonial city in the southwest of Uruguay founded by the Portuguese in 1680. Punta del Este – a city on the Atlantic coast in the southeast of Uruguay, also known as \"the Miami of South America\". Eating asado (barbecue). \nBesides family and friends, what do you miss most about home? \nThe beautiful scenery, which I think we appreciate even more now that we live away from it. We miss food and drinks that we love – pies, chocolate, fish 'n' chips, ginger beer, L&P, Vegemite, Marmite... the list goes on. \nHow easy is it for you to get back to NZ? \nNot that easy, there are no direct flights from Uruguay. We have to take Lan Chile via Santiago or Aerolineas/Air New Zealand via Buenos Aires. The flight is OK, and not as long as it used to take us to get back from England! \nFor Kiwis looking to move there, which industries are seeking fresh talent? \nMaybe farming, ESL teachers at private language schools. There is also a tax-free zone called Zona America that has foreign companies based in it – they recruit foreigners (and locals) but are often looking for specific qualifications and English speakers. \nKnow an expat who wants to share inside knowledge of their home away from home?
