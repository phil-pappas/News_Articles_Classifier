At 8, I had men putting dimes in my hands saying, ‘Call me. It’d be so great to f*** when you’re older.’ And just horrible stuff,” she said. “In the music business, it ended up serving me very well. I learned to keep my energy to myself, where there’s nothing about me that seemed approachable. And as men did approach me, I got very good at handling men in a way that sort of didn’t anger them. ... And at the same time using wit and usually humour to defuse the situation and to inform them, ‘P.S. Not available that way.’ “\nNot that kinda girl ... Jewel says she never slept her way to the top. Picture: Supplied Hit debut ... Pieces of You is one of the best-selling albums of all time. Picture: Supplied Jewel says she was singing in bars and coffee shops in San Diego when she was fired for refusing to have sex with her boss.\n“I’ve never been more propositioned by businessmen in my life. It was almost like they were sharks that could smell blood, like of vulnerability,” says Jewel. “I’d go back to my car, writing songs, and men would literally come up and proposition me. They would be like, ‘Hey, do you need rent money?’ you know and things like that. It was pretty wild. I never took anybody up on it, but it was interesting to see this side of men that basically would prey on somebody vulnerable.”\nStill singing ... Jewel has released her 12th studio album.
