She has worked at the charity since 2013 as Head of Commercial Events and Services for Hampton Court Palace. \nYoung hails from a live events background with experience of major sporting events, large scale concerts and entertainment shows at venues including The O2 and Wembley. Young – based at Hampton Court Palace – will be responsible for continuing to implement the Functions & Event strategy across the six Historic Royal Palaces, as well as overseeing the commercial services arm at Hampton Court Palace. The announcement comes as the charity also revealed it has made permanent the role of Jennifer Lockham, nee Walker, as Banqueting House Manager, a post she held on an acting basis as maternity cover. Lockham will be responsible for the operation, development and management of the Banqueting House and its team, maximising revenues from the range of private events, gala dinners and awards ceremonies that take place at Banqueting House over the course of a year. She will also be instrumental in coordinating the unveiling of the Whitehall venue - currently open but undergoing external refurbishment – in early 2016. Historic Royal Palaces is a charity that raises all its own funds, and reinvests income generated by private and corporate events at the palaces into caring for the historic buildings, and keeping them open for the public to enjoy. Young comments: “I am delighted that I have the opportunity to continue in this role within Historic Royal Palaces and I am looking forward to working with the events teams to further develop the strategic vision for events within the six palaces. It is fantastic to be part of a team where the commercials are directly helping to preserve the palaces and give our history a future.” Jennifer Lockham comments: “I am thrilled to be continuing in the role as Banqueting House Manager on a permanent basis. Banqueting House is such a fantastic venue representing a significant part of our history and it has been a pleasure working with the talented team here. I’m looking forward to working closely with clients on the many exciting events we have scheduled to take place at the venue, as well as coordinating the culmination of the current exterior restoration work early next year, before the conservation of the venue’s interior begins in 2018.” Paul Gray, Palaces Group Director at Historic Royal Palaces, says: “I am extremely pleased that Liz will be taking on this role and I look forward to working with her on the show-stopping calendar of events coming up this year. Historic Royal Palaces offer such a wide scope for event planners, from festivals at Hampton Court Palace and in-bound incentives at The Tower of London to high profile awards at Banqueting House. This role is different to many event planning roles, in that the monies raised help us to care for the palaces and keep them open for people to enjoy.” “I would also like to warmly congratulate Jennifer on her permanent appointment as Banqueting House Manager following a three stage interview process. I am sure this is the right appointment for Historic Royal Palaces and the Banqueting House team and look forward to Jennifer’s continued positive contribution to the role.” Historic Royal Palaces encompasses the Tower of London, Hampton Court Palace, the Banqueting House, Kensington Palace, Kew Palace, and Hillsborough Castle in Northern Ireland.
