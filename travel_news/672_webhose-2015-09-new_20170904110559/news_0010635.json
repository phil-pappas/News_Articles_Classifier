The current longest flight is Qantas’s 17-hour trip from Dallas to Sydney, at 5,578 miles. \n• How to survive a long-haul flight \nGoogle in Silicon Valley, which India wants to cement connections with Photo: Getty \nModi’s visit to the west coast city was the first to California by an Indian head of state since 1982, and was used to peddle the virtues of India’s developing tech economy as well as reach out to the tens of thousands of Indians who work in Silicon Valley. \nThe New Delhi-San Francisco service will be flown in a Boeing 777-200 LR (Long Range) plane. Air India already operates routes to New York, Newark and Chicago. \nA senior Air India official was quoted in the Times of India saying the airline was also planning a direct service between London and Ahmedabad.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T15:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T16:47:14.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
