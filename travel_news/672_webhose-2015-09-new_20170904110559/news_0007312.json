The Utah Department of Transportation is advising drivers of construction projects on Labor Day weekend. Scott G Winterton, Deseret News Summary \nThe Utah Department of Transportation is advising drivers of construction projects on Labor Day weekend. \nSALT LAKE CITY â€” The Utah Department of Transportation is advising drivers of construction projects on Labor Day weekend. \nWork in Summit County will reduce I-80 to one lane in each direction from the U.S. 40 interchange to Wanship. All traffic has been shifted to the eastbound lanes, and the speed limit is reduced to 45 mph. \nIn addition, the westbound on- and off-ramps at Exit 150 (Tollgate/Promontory) are closed. UDOT recommends that drivers avoid westbound I-80 on Monday, and use I-84 through Ogden as an alternate route. \nThe project, reconstructing 8 miles of I-80 with new concrete pavement, is scheduled for completion during fall. \nAll four lanes will remain open on I-15 at the Point of the Mountain between state Route 92 in Lehi and 12300 South in Draper. All four southbound lanes will have been shifted onto the new concrete pavement. Drivers should still expect delays due to heavy traffic during the weekend. Due to narrowed and shifting lanes throughout the construction zone, the speed limit has been reduced to 55 mph.
