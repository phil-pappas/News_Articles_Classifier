The Halal Tourism Conference 2015 was set to take place in Turkey In December bringing together delegates from across the globe to discuss and shape the agenda of one of the fastest growing sectors in the world. However, organisers today said that due to an increased level of demand and attendance by ministerial delegates from across the world, the event has been postponed for three months. The event has now been rescheduled to Spring and will take place from March 2016. \nOrganiser Tasneem Mahmood, from CM Media, said the three month postponement was positive news and would ensure a “bigger and more successful” conference. She said: “Due to the sheer amount of ministerial attendance and the high-level dignitaries we were expecting, we have decided to move the event to March due to requests from a number of Government offices and we have respected their wishes. “Working closely with our partners and delegates is a priority for us. However, we see this as a real positive and will mean that we can deliver an even better event just three months later. “We will continue working with our management team and partners to ensure a spectacular and bigger event in March. “All of the delegates currently booked on have been very positive with the news and we will honour everyone who has already booked on and move them to the March event.” Organisers say the move to March will now see over 1,200 delegates from over 50 countries, including industry experts, international speakers, specialists and tourism suppliers attend the event which will take place in Istanbul. It is the second international conference on halal tourism that has taken place in Europe. Last year’s inaugural event saw over 400 delegates visit Andalucia, Spain which brought together the global travel industry to discuss ways of tapping into this niche market. CM Media will partner with Tura Turizm to deliver the event which will attract tourism boards, tour agencies, tour operators, restaurants, media, hotels, airlines and suppliers to the travel sector. The event will feature seminars from industry experts, workshops, networking sessions and an exhibition. A series of workshops will provide with information on developing the industry including the launch of new products, luxury travel, standardisation, finance and investment, Hajj and Umrah providers, diversifying the halal tourism offer and the growing medical tourism sector. A number of the world’s leading experts have already confirmed their attendance to the event including Simon Coombs, President & CEO – Shaza Hotels, Fazal Bahardeen, CEO, CrescentRating & HalalTrip, Dr. Bandar Fahad Al Fehaid, Delegation of Arab Tourism Organization, Irfan Onal, Director General of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism Promotion and Rafi-Uddin Shikoh, founder and CEO of DinarStandard. The Halal Tourism Conference 2015 will now take place from March 21 to March 23 2015 at the Istanbul Convention & Exhibition Centre. It will be followed by a two day tour of Istanbul to provide businesses with a live case study of a region that is becoming more Muslim friendly and is actively working to meet the needs of Muslim travellers.
