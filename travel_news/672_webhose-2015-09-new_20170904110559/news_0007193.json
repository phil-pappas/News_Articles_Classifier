The Old Mutual UK Smaller Companies fund, managed by Dan Nickols, is considered one of the better choices available to investors, according to the experts who point out that the fund boasts a strong track record over the past decade. Mr Nickols is well regarded and has managed the fund since 2004. As the chart below shows the fund (blue line) has returned 238pc against 138pc (red line) for the average UK smaller company fund. According to FE Trustnet, the data firm, Mr Nickols has beaten peers every year since 2005. What makes the fund different… Mr Nickols targets three types of shares; • Shares that can consistently grow their earnings regardless of the economic backdrop, by for instance, boasting a market leading position in their line of business. • When analysts’ earnings expectations on a certain businesses are low – so therefore there is scope for share price to rise if the analysts’ have got their sums wrong. • Shares on low valuations that will benefit from positive change, such as a new management team coming on board. Top ten holdings…. What the experts think…. Tom Becket, who buys funds for Psigma, the wealth manager, said: “Mr Nichols is a very safe pair of hands, consistently outperforming rivals over the past decade. I rate him highly. “My only concern is that the amount of money he is now running, £840m, is quite a large figure and could be somewhat unwieldy to manage. I believe that the optimal size of a UK small cap fund is somewhere between £100m and £400m.” Darius McDermott, managing director of FundCalibre, the fund rating agency, said: “This has one of the best resourced management teams in this space and has benefited from strong, stable management. It has lower risk than the sector average and good long-term performance. We're fans of the manager.” The Telegraph Investor £10 to trade shares and no charge to buy & sell funds Open an account »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T19:38:24.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
