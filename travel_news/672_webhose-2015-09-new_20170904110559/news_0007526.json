You might want to forget that the Japanese players followed that performance up with a disappointing defeat to Scotland . As they say, you can’t win them all. Setting aside the defeat for a moment, the obvious question is how exactly did Japan coach Eddie Jones mastermind the historic victory in the first match? Intensive training? Inspired tactics? A motivational team talk? Perhaps it was none of the above. Footage has emerged this week of a Japanese film about the sport that might just have given the players all the inspiration needed. The game depicted seems to involve both humans and mythical creatures.
