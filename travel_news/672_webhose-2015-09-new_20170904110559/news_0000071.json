There will be a financial penalty for the operator if these government-set targets are not reached.\nThe East Anglia rail franchise is currently operated by Abellio Greater Anglia, which has been shortlisted as a contender for the new franchise alongside First Group and National Express.\nThe new operator is due to take over the nine-year franchise in October 2016 with the decision on the winning bid set to be announced by the government in summer 2016.\nAs part of the new franchise, the winning operator will have to cut journey times to 90 minutes on London to Norwich journeys on at least two journeys in each direction on every weekday, as well as to add 180 extra weekly services, improve the quality of trains on the network and introduce free wifi for all passengers.\nRail minister Claire Perry said: “For too long, passengers in East Anglia have not had the high-quality rail services that they deserve. Our ambitious requirements will change that by making journeys significantly better than they are now.\n“These plans will also ensure that East Anglia finally has a rail network that supports its growing economy.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BBT_online"], "published": "2015-09-18T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T18:05:31.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
