The new routes are part of the airline’s continuous transatlantic expansion plans and were confirmed in a letter from Norwegian’s CEO Bjorn Kjos to Ireland’s Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Paschal Donohoe. \n“This is only the beginning of our plans for new routes in Ireland, but our expansion relies on the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) finally approving Norwegian Air International’s application for a foreign carrier permit. Once we have the DOT’s approval, it will unlock the door for these exciting new routes, which will in turn create more competition, more choice and better fares for business and leisure passengers on both sides of the Atlantic,” said Kjos. “Norwegian is leading the way in offering affordable transatlantic travel and with the new aircraft we have on order, we are excited to offer our high-quality, low-cost service from the US to Cork.” \nThis is the sixth route out of Boston Logan International Airport the airline has announced in the last few months. In June, Norwegian announced it will launch flights to Guadeloupe and Martinique in the French Caribbean, starting December 3; and more recently, it announced long-haul service to Copenhagen, London and Oslo, also commencing May 2016. \n“We’re delighted that Norwegian will operate Cork Airport’s first transatlantic service. Cork Airport has a robust hinterland with a well-developed industrial base and a fantastic tourism product,” said Niall MacCarthy, Cork Airport Managing Director. “We’re sure there will be strong demand for these new transatlantic services from both business and leisure passengers. We look forward to working closely with Norwegian and our local partners to promote these new services and to grow passenger traffic at Cork.” \nNorwegian is the only airline to offer long-haul low-cost flights from the US The airline currently has 25 nonstop routes to Europe (Copenhagen, London, Oslo and Stockholm) from Boston, Fort Lauderdale, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, New York, Oakland/San Francisco, Orlando, San Juan and St. Croix (USVI), with fares as low as $215 one-way, including taxes and surcharges. The new US to Cork routes announced today are: \n- Boston to Cork service planned for May 2016 with 4-5 flights per week, operated by a Boeing 737-800 \n- New York to Cork service planned for 2017, to be operated by the new Boeing 737MAX, for which Norwegian will be the manufacturer’s European launch customer \nAbout Norwegian \nFounded in 1993 and headquartered in Oslo, Norway, award-winning Norwegian Air Shuttle is the third largest low-cost carrier in Europe and the world’s seventh largest.
