Marcus has strong connections with Belfast, as his father was a naval architect for Harland and Wolff during the 1940s and worked in the historic Drawing Offices, where RMS Titanic was designed.\nLast year, Tourism Ireland commissioned Marcus to produce a video on the Port of Belfast, which was shown in New York at a special event to celebrate the premier of his BAFTA award-winning film, entitled Rebuilding the World Trade Centre. Marcus’s film will be promoted on Tourism Ireland’s website, Ireland.com, which attracted more than 14.25 million visitors in 2014.\nTourism Ireland will also share the film on social media – with its Facebook fans (3 million fans worldwide) and Twitter followers (300,000+), and on its YouTube Channel (more than 21 million views). Niall Gibbons, Tourism Ireland’s CEO, said: “We are delighted that Marcus has returned to Belfast, to capture the vibrant and creative city that Belfast has become. We are sure that his very personal take on the city will inspire many visitors to come and discover the destination for themselves.”\nSource:- Tourism Ireland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T17:13:45.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
