Embark on a Great British Drive » When Michelin launched its first, celebrated Guide to the British Isles in 1911, horses outnumbered cars and the very idea of tackling a motoring tour seemed novel and exciting. But that’s exactly what the guide wanted to encourage, providing motorists with all the information needed for their journey, including where to refuel, where to eat – and where to find new tyres. Cautions about “steep descents” sent shivers down motorists’ spines, but in the days when car brakes weren’t entirely reliable, they were essential. Today’s cars easily cover hundreds of miles a day, no matter how hilly, and tyres have been developed to perform superbly over the roughest terrain. But while vehicles and tyres have changed dramatically over the past century, Michelin has remained true to its principles. It continues to be at the forefront of advances in mobility, offering long-lasting, fuel-saving, damage-resistant tyres delivering excellent grip in all conditions. Driven by innovation, Michelin spends £500 million annually on tyre research and development, carried out by its 6,000 scientists. The same dedication goes into its guides, including the Great Britain & Ireland 2016 edition being launched on 17 September and its Eating Out in Pubs guide in October. Just as Michelin’s tyres have advanced, so have its guides. They reflect the changing landscape of eating out in Britain, an evolution that has seen the rise of inventive young chefs and restaurateurs dedicated to a more informal style, based on innovation and exceptional ingredients. Here’s to another century of innovation.
