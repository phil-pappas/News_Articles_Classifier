They also spent big, contributing A$7 billion, a 32 per cent spike, to account for around A$1 in every A$5 spent by international visitors during the year. \nTourists from the United States (544,000) and New Zealand (1.2 million) also rose, while those from Britain and Japan remained steady. \nIndia was one of the fastest growing markets, boosted in part by Australia co-hosting the Cricket World Cup with New Zealand, with 207,000 people making the trip, up 20 per cent, and their spending surpassing A$1 billion for the first time. \n\"Tourism can be our fastest growing sector this decade if we continue to leverage our 'clean, green and safe' brand to position ourselves as the number one, long-haul destination in Asia,\" Trade Minister Andrew Robb said. \n\"With China now accounting for one in every five dollars spent by international visitors, it is clear that China is vital to the sustained growth of our tourism sector.\" \nNew South Wales, home to Sydney, was the most visited state, followed by Victoria and Queensland. — AFP-Relaxnews More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T13:34:22.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
