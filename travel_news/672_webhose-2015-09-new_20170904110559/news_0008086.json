The Bonus Spin progressive technology, which is already being used in AGS' popular Count's Kustoms Blackjack™ game, allows the Company to enter the popular progressive/bonusing space with a very unique offering.\n\"We are thrilled to add these two proven titles and the bonusing technology to our fast-growing product portfolio,\" said John Hemberger , Vice President of Table Products for AGS. \"When it comes to blackjack side bets and draw poker games, Buster Blackjack and Double Draw Poker are well established games in their respective genres. Bonus Spin is the successful centerpiece of our Count's Kustoms Blackjack game and now that we own the technology, we look forward to introducing even more entertainment-themed brands that utilize this feature. The Bonus Spin technology also enables AGS to offer progressive upgrades for our entire library of over 20 table game titles.\"\nBuster Blackjack®\nPurchased from Betwiser Games and developed by Stanley Ko , Buster Blackjack is the preeminent blackjack side bet across the entire California casino market with an emerging presence in Arizona and Washington . The game's popularity stems from its strong \"community gaming\" dynamic where all players are rooting for the same outcome: a dealer bust. With over 250 tables installed in over 60 casinos, Buster Blackjack makes a huge impact on AGS' table games footprint.\nDouble Draw Poker™\nDouble Draw Poker was acquired from inventor Ron LaDuca and In Bet Gaming, who developed three of AGS' current titles – In Bet™, Criss Cross Poker™ , and Hot Roller Craps™ . This game is unique as it offers players the option to draw multiple cards while competing with a paytable on a poker derivative-type game. Draw poker games seldom sustain any kind of success, but Double Draw Poker is the rare exception with strong performance at a number of large casinos, such as Mohegan Sun , Harrah's New Orleans , Seminoles, and Snoqualmie, just to name a few.\nBonus Spin™ Technology and Table Signage\nAcquired from Aristocrat, Bonus Spin technology allows AGS to offer a bonusing/progressive system which customers can add to existing table games in the form of a virtual wheel. This allows players a chance to win top jackpots or prizes even when achieving a premium hand, which occurs quite frequently. Bonusing and progressive jackpots have become a huge part of the pit as they greatly intensify player excitement and allow operators to improve earnings per table.\nAdditional assets acquired in the deal included table signage products which allows AGS to now offer its customers attractive roulette, baccarat, and table limit signs. The Company's plan to provide eye-catching, vibrant displays for table games is another example of its strategy to become the preferred supplier of products and services for the pit.\nAbout AGS\nAGS is a full-service designer and manufacturer of gaming products for the casino floor. The Company's roots are in the Class II, Native American market, and it has recently expanded its product lines to include top performing slot games for the Class III commercial marketplace as well as specialty table game products and mobile games.
