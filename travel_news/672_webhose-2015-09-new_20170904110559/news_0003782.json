And there was a boy born with a timid blue eyes and a beautiful, dimpled smile. The prince of the dynasty that no longer exists was named Dhonhiyala. The Maldivian sorcerer or fanita veriyaa (the one who knew the magic arts) was known as a hero. And in the land that no longer exists he lived a peaceful life. \n\nOn the night when a boy grew into a man, she came and changed the entirety of his life. It has been a long time since he stopped looking for her. Then, everything became quiet. He learned that it is better to wait. He knew that one night she will come to him. Otherwise, why would she spend all those hours just staring at him? Years were passing through the spaces between moments. Doesn't matter, he will wait. \n\nBut it was not always like that. When he met her, in the land that no longer exists, he started following her. He crossed the oceans, sailed the seas, he flew on the wings of the wind. And it was long ago, when the wind spoke with a voice you could understand. For her, the sorcerer found love. He spent nights and days making a contribution to her beauty. He took a hundred thousands of coral reefs and created a necklace shaped land for her. He chose warm equatorial area of the Indian Ocean to place the islands and made sure all of them are surrounded by very deep waters. He just had to wait for her to come. He thought his proposal was refutable. But once again she didn't show up. Desperate, slave of that desire he ran after her. Dhonhiyala's timid eyes become bold and smile turned into a frown. He did everything to reach her. And when he thought he was close, he was still very far. He felt lost, not knowing what to do. In the middle of that endless sea, the boat was sinking and the world was getting smaller and smaller from all that passion. Then, he changed his life. He went back to the Necklace Islands (Maldives) and settled down. \n\nAnd time went by. A story, a story, let it come, let it go. He didn't run any more. He was waiting. The day he stopped running after her, in the beautiful, blue sea alluring ring appeared. And it was made of coral reefs. Divine, illusive Alifulhu took the hand of him and became the princess of Maldives.\n\nIn the end was the Blue, nevertheless not the hue we know. The Blue was bluish, similar to nothing we saw. And if they are not dead, they still live. Footprints are still there in the sands of time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T01:10:46.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
