It pays for 112 distinct programs spread across eight federal agencies. But more than half of the programs specially targeting serious mental illness don’t even evaluate their effectiveness, according to the GAO.\nIn that cacophony of bureaucratic dysfunction, an estimated 40 percent of people with serious mental illness don’t even get care. And when many do ultimately get some level of treatment, it is provided in prison.\nCongress can change that — and change it this year. There is growing momentum behind a landmark mental-health-reform bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa., the only practicing psychologist in Congress. Murphy has the support of a key committee chairman, and 118 co-sponsors on his bill.\nMost Read Stories No change in status of Seahawks safety Kam Chancellor as holdout continues Seattle Aquarium trains otter to use inhaler for her asthma Mariners' Kyle Seager drilled by Jered Weaver after frustrations boil over Seattle police chief fires cop who arrested man carrying golf club Haggen plans broad retreat from costly expansion, filing shows Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. Murphy notes that the nation’s annual deaths to suicide (about 41,000) and drug overdose (about 44,000) equal all combat deaths in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq combined.\n“You have to ask, what are we doing wrong here?” Murphy said.\nThese are not new facts. Congress has failed to respond to the need for mental-health reform, again and again, as it became tied to gun-control proposals.\nThe Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act separates the two and refocuses fractured federal resources on treating serious mental illness. It would end an antiquated Medicaid rule that banned funding for psychiatric hospitals larger than 16 beds. It gives families more tools to be involved in the care of a suffering loved one. It encourages telemedicine to improve psychiatric care in rural areas, where psychiatrists are scarce, and pays for mental-health training for police officers.\nAmong Washington’s delegation, only Rep. Denny Heck, D-Olympia, has signed on. Seattle Democrat Jim McDermott, a psychiatrist, said this week he supports it — describing it as the biggest potential mental-health reform in decades — but hasn’t signed on yet because he wants to make sure he knows what’s going to be in the final product.\nMurphy said the only way this complex, and likely expensive, piece of legislation will pass Congress is with a push from families familiar with the dysfunction of the current system.\nMembers of Congress don’t have public email addresses, but do have online contact forms found at 1.usa.gov/1e8pAws. Give this proposal a push.\nEditorial board members are editorial page editor Kate Riley, Frank A.
