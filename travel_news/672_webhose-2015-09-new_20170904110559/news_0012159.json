The hotels chain provider will be joining HotelsPro with an extensive portfolio of Caesars hotels.\nThe group believe that the successful collaboration with Caesars Entertainment will spark an increase of sales between 20%-25% each year. HotelsPro’s USA Market Manager, Rosalynn Castillo, commented on the new alliance and said, “We are hoping to continue and improve our relationship with Caesars Entertainment. The new addition to HotelsPro is believed to be very effective as Caesars Entertainment already has an established brand name. Vibrant destinations that now will be included through Caesars Entertainment, could become a preferred choice for HotelsPro’s customer base. This collaboration will allow both sides to benefit from the immerse traffic of 40 million visitors of Las Vegas every year.”\nHotelsPro continuously explores opportunities to develop their geographical presence in order to satisfy distinct consumer needs through offering diverse options. Already a strong player in the travel industry, HotelsPro is excited to capture a new market and increase their accommodation options to better serve tour operators, travel agencies and OTAs across the globe.
