TAKE A PUNT \nClimb aboard a locally-made classic punt and follow the Avon River as it winds through Christchurch's Botanic Gardens. In spring this is one of the best ways to see the Garden City in bloom. In a nod to the city's English past, an Edwardian-themed punter is your guide for the boat ride. \n2. VENTURE EAST \nThe Tannery site alongside the Heathcote River in Woolston, was badly damaged in the February 22, 2011 earthquake; however some quick work by the owners has transformed it into a popular spot to down an award-winning craft beer or do some retail therapy with a boutique feel. \n3. NATIONAL GAME \nAs the first Union established in New Zealand in 1879, Canterbury has a proud rugby history. Some of the current stars of the game, like All Blacks Richie McCaw and Dan Carter, hail from here. There is some quality rugby on show at ITM Cup level and AMI Stadium gets you closer to the action than most stadiums in major centres. \n4. AERIAL VIEW \nHead for the Port Hills and take a gondola ride to the top. You'll see Canterbury from a whole new perspective as you look out over the city, the Southern Alps, Banks Peninsula, Lyttelton Harbour, Pegasus Bay and the Pacific Ocean. For the more fit or adventurous you can walk or mountain bike one of the trails back down. \n5. SURF'S UP \nNew Brighton Beach has the biggest ocean pier in Australasia. But if you prefer sand under your toes there is an expansive shoreline to wander. This also is the only place in Christchurch to catch a wave. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T07:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T07:13:22.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
