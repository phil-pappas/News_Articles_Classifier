Whether it be taking a laid back Caribbean cruise , or booking a flight to just one island, there are several different things you can do to get your fill of adrenaline pumping activities in. During my various trips back and forth, I was extremely lucky to experience much of this. Between Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, and many other islands, this experience is leading me on a sailing trip around all of the islands . Needless to say, I am extremely stoked for the opportunity. But without further ado, check out these top outdoor adventures that you just canâ€™t miss out on while youâ€™re planning your trip to this tropical region of the world! Top Outdoor Adventures in the Caribbean Hike El Yunque Rainforest in Puerto Rico Located right in the middle of cultural Puerto Rico , El Yunque National Rainforest has vast opportunities to explore. The tropical rainforest here hosts a number of unique plant and animal species such as the endangered Puerto Rican Parrot, indigenous tree frogs, and surprisingly no venomous snakes! The mysterious nature of El Yunque offers a gentle first time hiking experience for those who have never hiked a rainforest before. If you make it all the way to itâ€™s peak, youâ€™ll be greeted with phenomenal views of the entire island with waterfalls giving you a chance to cool off along the way. Any previous opinions of Puerto Rico are guaranteed to change completely! Day Sailing the Caribbean Sea Thereâ€™s no adventure quite like sailing. The fresh ocean breeze blowing right in your face, the embracing warmth of the sun, and of course, the freedom to go wherever it is that youâ€™d like to go. One thing I found out about visiting the Caribbean, itâ€™s not complete without a days trip sailing the Caribbean Sea. And when I say a day, I mean that should be your minimum. If given the opportunity to jump onboard someone sailboat as a guest, take the invitation. Not sure exactly where you want to sail? Click here to check out this guide I put together with my fellow travel bloggers who have some pretty awesome recommendations on where to go, what to see, and what to do! ðŸ˜‰ Snorkel or Dive Reef & Wreck Sites No trip to the Caribbean is complete without a trip under the sea! After all, isnâ€™t that the main attractions for this part of the world? Those crystal clear Caribbean waters offer plenty of prime locations to dive for ship wrecks, underwater caves, and coral reefs. If youâ€™re looking to get a little more crazy, then you may even want to check out some of the more prime locations for shark diving. These top 5 shark dives sites will give you an up close and personal view of one of natures most feared, and respected, animals to get that adrenaline pumping! Zip-Lining the Jungle Canopies Giving you a very unique perspective of the Caribbean Islands, taking a day to go zip-lining above the rainforest floors will give you a â€˜birds eye viewâ€™ of the islandâ€¦literally. You wonâ€™t find primates swinging through the trees like you do on the Gibbon Experience , but what you will get are a plethora of scenic views from tall trees and a chance to see tropical birds in their natural environment. Taking a moment to view it from a different perspective, zip-lining will have you flying through the tree tops and past difficult terrain like you never had before! Hike a Volcano Hiking can be a thrill in itself. Tag on the fact that youâ€™re embracing a volcano, and your experience can be entirely different! Some islands such as in the Dominican Republic, can lead you to a climb of more than 10,000 feet above sea level while others, such as those in St. Vincent, can lead you up an active volcano. This experience can be extremely chillingâ€¦especially given the fact that itâ€™s last eruption was just in 1979 and it most deadliest was in 1902 killing 1,680 of its local inhabitants.
