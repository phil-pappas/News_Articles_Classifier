These efficient, torquey units are ideal for grand tourers, because they provide great lumps of torque at low revs – hence very powerful at low revs – and burn fuel more efficiently than their V6 and V8 petrol counterparts. Mercedes was one of the first luxury car brands to embrace diesel technology. Its premium saloons have been given the diesel treatment since the Fifties and a huge fanbase of owners cherish their early Nineties W123 and W124 diesel saloons – which many experts, including the Telegraph’s Honest John, have always stipulated are modern classics in the making. Mercedes’ premium offerings now include the S350 Bluetec, which thanks to its low company car tax was named What Car? ’s best diesel luxury car ever. When luxury Italian car brands embrace diesel, you know it is time to do likewise BMW and Audi offer several dynamic luxury diesels, including the 7-Series and the A8. In fact, nowadays it is hard to find a luxury car that does not come as a diesel. Infiniti, Nissan’s luxury arm, misjudged British tastes when it dared to launch here in 2009 without one: the Q50 diesel arrived last year. And of course there is Land Rover. With its improved pulling power, diesel has always had a place in the prestigious heartland of the premium off-roader. Modern classic: a Mercedes W124 E-Class from the Nineties Jaguar Land Rover’s 3.0-litre TDV6 diesel engine sits well in the Range Rover Vogue – which, with its cream leather and TVs, is one of the world’s most luxurious cars of any description. Even Volkswagen has applied derv to its halo car, the Golf GTI hot hatch. The Golf GTD model successfully emulates the performance and style of the GTI, but with more affordable fuel bills. It is a win-win situation if ever there was one, and one that proves beyond doubt the sports-performance capabilities of diesel in road cars. Finally, if anyone was still in any doubt, Maserati, guardian of Italian sporting performance and free-revving passion, offers its premium Quattroporte saloon with the choice of a 3.0-litre V6 diesel. When luxury Italian car brands embrace diesel, you know it is time to do likewise.
