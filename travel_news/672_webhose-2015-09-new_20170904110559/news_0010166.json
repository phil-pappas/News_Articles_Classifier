Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \nAUSTRALIAN travellers are paying a lot more for a hotel room in the US compared with a year ago, but there are still bargains to be had in Southeast Asia. \nThe latest Hotel Price Index by Hotels.com shows Phnom Penh in Cambodia offers the best deal for Aussies with rooms averaging $71 a night, followed by Chiang Mai in Thailand for $73. \nHanoi in Vietnam and the Thai city of Pattaya were equal third with rates of $76 a night, then Siem Reap in Cambodia on $78. \nAt home, Darwin hotels provided the best value at an average $170 a night while the Whitsunday Islands were the most expensive, averaging $244 a night. Value ... Darwin is the cheapest city in Australia to rent a hotel room.
