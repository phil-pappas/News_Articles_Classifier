The announcement marks the first collaboration between the world’s leading name in luxury hotels and resorts, and one of the interior design talents of his generation.\nThe concept for Four Seasons Hotel Bangkok at Chao Phraya River is to create a landmark destination and bring to life the brand’s vision for Bangkok’s first truly urban resort. “Bangkok is a truly engaging and incredible city that inspires me with its energy and rich heritage. The thriving tourist culture and world-wide perception of its fantastic service has developed a highly competitive climate for the luxury hotel industry. What excited me about the Four Seasons project was Country Group’s unique vision and value proposition in creating the first true ultra-luxury, urban resort hotel, which distinguishes itself from all other developments in Bangkok. It is a great opportunity to be part of an important development that is set to redefine the urban resort concept in Asia,” said Gathy.\nFour Seasons Hotel Bangkok at Chao Phraya River is a low-rise, urban resort hotel sprawled across the entire southern span of Chao Phraya Estate. Set on one of the largest land areas directly allocated to one hotel with an unprecedented 200 metres (650 feet) of river frontage, it is poised to become a truly unique urban resort arranged in a series of cascading green courtyards and lush landscapes. It will also feature state-of-the-art meeting and function spaces, including the largest riverfront Grand Ballroom in Bangkok; and myriad world-class entertainment offerings along the property’s waterfront promenade featuring an array of restaurants and bars.\nAccording to Ben Taechaubol, Chief Executive Officer of Country Group Development PCL, “Jean-Michel is, without a doubt, synonymous with designing some of the world’s most stunning resorts and hotels, with an approach to design that combines a sense of place with a sense of luxurious, contemporary style – which is exactly what we want to achieve with this project with Four Seasons.. Looking at his impressive portfolio and experience, it is clear he understands our vision of creating a resort destination like no other Bangkok has seen before.”\nChristopher W. Norton, President, Global Products and Operations, Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, said, “We have been looking for the right opportunity to work with Jean-Michel, and Four Seasons Hotel Bangkok at Chao Phraya River is perfect, as the Four Seasons brand embodies luxury at the highest level. We place great importance on working with world leading designers that share our passion for bringing to life our vision for our brand in Asia, which is a key component to our business’s success for the next decade.”\nDenniston will work on the interior and hardscape design of Four Seasons Hotel Bangkok at Chao Phraya River with BAMO designing the interiors of Four Seasons Private Residences Bangkok at Chao Phraya River – both consultants will work alongside the internally acclaimed masterplan and design consultants Hamiltons International.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T00:03:22.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
