Faced with skyrocketing costs of living – particularly housing and education – these families are finding their new home vibrant, affordable, and friendly. This past summer, fifteen more families relocated from cities as diverse as Rochester , Boston , Nashville , New York and Seattle .\nFor more information, please download event flyer or visit www.100newfamilies.com .\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150921/269007\nIn an effort to recruit even more families, the Memphis Jewish community will be showcasing itself at the third \"Taste of Jewish Memphis\" experience over the weekend of October 17th.\nWhile better known for high-profile tourist destinations (Graceland, Beale St.), Memphis is also home to a strong Jewish community across all denominations, featuring seven synagogues, two day schools, a bustling Jewish Community Center and a wide availability of kosher food. Rabbi Micah Greenstein , the Senior Rabbi at Temple Israel, is excited about \"the growth of an organic community of young professionals, most of whom just moved here. I anticipate a vibrant future for Memphis Jewry with a wonderful new array of expressions and approaches.\"\nWhile being able to participate in a plethora of activities, Memphians simultaneously enjoy a relaxed, stress-free lifestyle. Drs. Ari and Lindi VanderWalde moved to Memphis two years ago from Los Angeles . They found that \"it is the rare city where one can experience both small-town perks and an exceptional Jewish community, complete with choices of schools and synagogues. The pace of life is slow and very family friendly. There is an abundance of outdoor space and the kids are able to play safely. Protecting family time is a cultural value in the city; the workday ends comparatively early for even the busiest professionals. People are friendly, accommodating and genuinely care about each other. And traffic is now a thing of the past!\"\nNew Memphis arrivals Chana Dina and Yoel Goldblatt left Teaneck, New Jersey this summer with their four children ages 7 to 16. Yoel is a partner at Deloitte and Touche and Chana Dina is also a CPA. They have both been overwhelmed by the outpouring of hospitality before and since their arrival. \"The Memphis Jewish community has gone out of its way to ensure that we're settled and comfortable,\" Chana Dina says. \"We're thrilled to have found a community this warm and welcoming!\"\nThe upcoming mid-October \"Taste of Memphis Weekend\" promises to build on the success of its previous two events. According to the organizers, visitors will enjoy a memorable weekend featuring the finest Southern home hospitality. Participants will have multiple opportunities to interact with engaging families and speak with employment and real estate experts. In addition to Memphis sightseeing, there will be open opportunities on Friday and Sunday to visit the synagogues, schools and other community institutions such as the JCC. On Saturday night, authors Faye and Jonathan Kellerman will host a signing party promoting their respective newest released books.\nOn Sunday morning, the weekend climaxes with the \"27 th Annual Memphis Kosher Barbecue Contest,\" a community-wide event featuring fun for the whole family. The Kellermans – who are also well-known as passionate fans of interesting food – will be the official barbecue judges.\nTo further encourage Jewish families to explore life in Memphis , the Jewish community is offering a generous incentive package, including a $250 subsidy towards a family's flights to visit for a weekend. New Memphians will receive three months of free membership at the JCC plus $500 towards relocation expenses. Probably most importantly, substantial multi-year tuition discounts are also available to new arrivals.\n\"We are delighted to have welcomed into our community a number of young families, all of whom have settled in well and whose children are thriving in the Jewish Day Schools, and we eagerly await the next contingent,\" adds Rabbi Shai Finkelstein , Senior Rabbi at Baron Hirsch, the nationally renowned 150-year-old synagogue.\nContact: 100newfamilies@gmail.com or 901-219-9794\n releases/memphis-jews-invite-100-new-families-to-become-their-neighbors-300146569.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.100newfamilies.com/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/memphis-jews-invite-100-new-families-to-become-their-neighbors-300146569.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150921/269007", "https://www.facebook.com/100newfamilies/photos/a.317337105115679.1073741831.305590456290344/472157112967010/?type=1", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LA07827&Transmission_Id=201509212030PR_NEWS_USPR_____LA07827&DateId=20150921"], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T06:11:19.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
