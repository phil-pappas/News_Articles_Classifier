The award was presented today at BusCon 2015 in Indianapolis .\nGCRTA rolled out the Lytx DriveCam program fleet-wide in 2014 to help protect its operators, reduce costs associated with risky driving behaviors, and contribute to safer Cleveland roads. The Lytx DriveCam program is a video-based safety solution that identifies behaviors that have the highest likelihood of leading to a collision, and provides data-driven insights to focus coaching efforts on improving those behaviors.\nDuring the past year, GCRTA saw 60 percent reduction in posted speed violations, 55 percent reduction in red light violations, and 53 percent improvement in seat belt compliance.\nOperator acceptance was key in achieving these results, and the GCRTA team stayed in constant communication with ATU Local 268 and associated operators, before, during, and after the pilot.\n\"The Lytx DriveCam program has the market-leading technology that has generated significant improvements in the riskiest behaviors among our operator base,\" said George Fields , director, Training & Development for GCRTA. \"They've translated driving data into precise and powerful insights that delivered an immediate and positive impact on our operator safety, and the safety of our community.\"\n\"GCRTA had the foresight and concern for its operators and riders to proactively seek out a comprehensive safety solution, and they've been thorough in leveraging our sophisticated data capture and analytics tools to create a smooth and direct path to safer driving,\" said Lytx Government Sales Director Rush Akin . \"It's gratifying to see that our partnership with GCRTA has been recognized with the Innovative Solutions Award, but protecting employees, riders and the Cleveland roads is the real reward.\"\nAbout Lytx\nAt Lytx Inc., we harness the power of data to change human behaviour and help good companies become even better.
