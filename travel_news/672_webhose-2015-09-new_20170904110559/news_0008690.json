I was walking along the famed Cliff Walk in Newport, R.I., taking in the mansions and lawns, the ocean and waves. It was quiet, at moments I felt like I had the coastline to myself. I reflected on the wealthy who once (and in some cases still do) inhabited those mansions each summer. Come Labor Day, they’d head back to New York or Philly or wherever their riches were made.\nBut post-high-season Newport is the time to be here. From the quieter beaches (which are lovely even on a cold day), to grabbing seats in any restaurant without worry, to the deep blue that the sea takes on this time of year, Newport may even reach its peak beauty once peak season has passed.\nI headed down recently for a few days’ escape. I chose the Newport Marriott as my home base — the hotel closed all of last winter and reopened this spring. It’s been retooled to evoke a nautical theme, but in an understated way. Walk by the dining booths and admire the stained wood and shape, like the hull of a ship. Glance up at the light curtains above and you can almost feel the wind in your hair as you realize they’re made of sailcloth.\nOne thing unchanged about the hotel is the location. Tucked into a nook of Newport Harbor, the hotel is within walking distance of shopping, dining, waterfront fun, history and more. The Newport visitor center, complete with shuttle bus stop, is next door. And its adorable Villy bikes are available to rent for a small fee and a great way to zip around town.\nI arrived early my first day in Newport and headed to the Cliff Walk. Now dotted with informational stops where you can scan with your smartphone and get historic details, the Cliff Walk can be a leisurely stroll, a historic self-guided tour or a combo of both.\nI noticed too that the “love lock” tradition of Paris has now come to Newport. Traditionally, lovers place a lock on a bridge, fence or gate, sometimes with their initials, and throw away the key, a symbol of their unbreakable love. Locks dotted the fencing, each hinting of a unique love story.\nI opted to do some shopping, window and otherwise, and to find a great meal. I wandered through the Brick Marketplace, finding doodads and some beautiful attire, then settled at the Brick Alley Pub (brickalley.com) for a perfect lunch of a lobster Reuben and a — get this — Pickle Martini. Not usually one to have a daytime cocktail, it felt sinful and tasted sublime with my sandwich.\nLate in the day I headed to the Spa at Newport Marriott for a combination Swedish and deep-tissue aromatherapy massage.\nRefreshed and ready for more, I headed to dinner at the hotel’s MainSail Restaurant. With a table next to huge windows, I savored oysters and a seafood risotto, washed down by a signature tequila drink. I lingered over dinner, and then chose to have my dessert and a nightcap at the Skiff Bar next door.\nThe next morning, after a filling breakfast in the hotel’s “M Club” (which is worth being a Marriott member for), I headed out for a day of Newport fun. Since I’ve been to the Tennis Hall of Fame many times, I focused on mansions, first sailing by many of them and hearing great tales on a 90-minute windjammer tour aboard the schooner Madeleine. This time of year, the crew told me, the tours are less crowded and folks can spread out on the ship, and ask more questions as they sail along. With a brisk breeze, we moved along the slate blue sea at an exhilarating pace, seeing Newport and its famed spots from a different point of view. So great was the cruise, I’d name it a “must do” for any visitor. Go to www.cruisenewport.com for details.\nNo visit to Newport is complete without mansion tours. The decor, back stories and views are worth multiple visits. I also took in a special tour that showed them through the eyes of the servants of the time. It’s a great way to see a different side of Newport life.\nAfterward, I walked the water­front, shopping and hanging out, enjoying a bloody Mary and fresh oysters at Midtown Oyster Bar (www.midtownoyster.com), which felt, despite the tourist-central location, completely local.\nBack at my hotel, I opted to spend the evening with lighter fare at the bar, this time I arrived early enough to enjoy the end-of-day light. It’s great that the Newport Marriott will be open all winter now that renovations are done. There’s even a fall package, the Rum and Be Well Package, perfect for weekend getaways, including a complimentary Bay ­Island Scrub for two, reserved use of two Newport Marriott custom Villy Bikes, a $25 credit for two rum cocktails upon arrival at Skiff Bar, and accommodations in the ­hotel’s newly renovated guest rooms.\nThere was more I could do, but I had to head home. I’ll be back though, to visit more museums, eat more local fare and take in the richness of Newport, which the wealthy left behind at the end of each summer.
