Those who agree the South Island is the best, and those who are lying. \nI base this on strong, scientifically gathered evidence. In March this year, I drove from Wellington to the Coromandel and back. Last week I did the same between Christchurch and Queenstown. \nThe Northern jaunt included lounging on the Kapiti Coast, drinking wine and admiring the view from Ruapehu, crossing Tongariro, swimming in Taupo, surfing (or failing to) in the Coromandel and slogging up Mt Maunganui. CECILE MEIER/FAIRFAX NZ \nAoraki - you don't get that in the North Island \nIn the south, we saw lakes in shades of blue and green we never knew existed, walked through spectacular snowy peaks, drove along roads bordered by huge skies and golden tussocks, and steamed across Lake Wakatipu. \nSure, the Coromandel region is amazing and probably the best summer holiday spot in the country with its stunning beaches and warmer temperatures. Wellington and Auckland are exciting cities, and there is more geothermal activity and cultural diversity in the north. \nBut the South Island is New Zealand, only more so. The air is crisper, the water is clearer, the snow is whiter, the hills are emptier and there are more sheep. No wonder it's nicknamed The Mainland. CECILE MEIER/FAIRFAX NZ \nDriving through the South island, it's mountain after lake after rolling hills. \nDriving down south, it's mountain after lake after rolling hills and you're often alone on the road. \nNorth Island roads get boring quickly and the boredom is regularly replaced by rage at yet another painfully slow campervan driver who doesn't understand the concept of letting traffic pass. \nYet, the majority of tourists arrive in New Zealand through Auckland. According to Statistics New Zealand, both islands get roughly the same number of visits throughout the year. \nTourists don't seem to realise how much more amazing the south is. Then again, many don't seem to know New Zealand has two islands, and others probably planned to drive here from Sydney. Ad Feedback \nThe fact that the islands attract the same number of visitors tells me that someone isn't doing their job right. \nIt's like I had a party and let half the guests mill around my 20 square metre front garden, with its pleasant view on the beach, while the other half were allowed into my vast, Palace of Versailles-esque manicured rear garden/orchard. \nMy family is coming to visit from Europe around Christmas time and they have asked me for recommendations for a road trip. They only have about five days so they would have to choose one island. \nThey seem to have heard more about North Island beaches and Auckland than about all South Island destinations put together. \nWhichever island they choose to visit, they'll miss stunning sights. But if they explore the south, I will feel like they've seen what makes New Zealand most unique. \nWhich island is your favourite? Where should I go in the North Island to change my mind?
