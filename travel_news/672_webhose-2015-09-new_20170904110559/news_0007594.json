Hilliard, Founding Partner at Hilliard Munoz Gonzales, LLP, and lead counsel for all personal injury and death cases inside the national GM litigation, today has requested a Temporary Restraining Order for the Texas class-members in a class-action lawsuit against the German automaker, Volkswagen for installing \"defeat device\" software in some 11 million vehicles in order to deceive consumers about the efficacy of its \"clean diesel\" vehicles and cheat on environmental emissions tests.\n\"We have asked the Court to order that Volkswagen preserve all evidence related to this recall and defeat devices. Given the large scale of this case and the clear criminal implications, it is critical that no further misconduct occurs,\" Hilliard says.\n\"It is also critical that the Court prevent Volkwagen from continuing to sell vehicles with defeat devices. The Volkswagen brand is already destroyed--my clients have been and will continue to be harmed--we cannot continue to allow VW vehicles on the road that emit up to 40x more harmful chemicals into the air. Exposure to these chemicals can cause severe respiratory problems, hospitalization, and even increase the rate of death.\"\nHMG has filed a class action lawsuit in the County Court at Law No. 1, Nueces County on behalf of Daniel Tamez and affected owners of VW vehicles in an effort to force the auto giant to take responsibility for defrauding its customers and for disregarding the environmental emission standards designed to limit pollution in the places we all call home.\nThe hearing for the Temporary Restraining Order will take place in County Court at Law No. 1, Nueces County in front of the Honorable Robert Vargas at 2 pm CST .\nHilliard recently negotiated a historic settlement with GM on behalf of over 1,300 ignition switch plaintiffs.\nABOUT HMG http://www.hmglawfirm.com/\nHilliard Munoz Gonzales LLP (HMG) specializes in mass torts, personal injury, product liability, commercial and business litigation, and wrongful death.
