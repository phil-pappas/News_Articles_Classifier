Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Sep 09, 2015 RwandAir CEO John Mirenge shakes hands with Airbus and Rolls Royce representatives eTN Exclusive: Unique and original, timely, global breaking news: \nToday, formal documents were signed for the purchase of two Airbus A330 aircraft, one being an A330-200 version and one being the larger A330-300 variant for RwandAir. The aircraft types are certified for ETOP operations beyond 180 minutes, important for the proposed routes to China. \nBoth aircraft, when delivered in September and December 2016 respectively, will be powered by one of the best engines on the market, the Rolls Royce Trent 772B. These first ever wide-body aircraft set to join the growing RwandAir fleet will be configured in a three-class layout of Business Class, Premium Economy, and Economy. The smaller A330-200 will offer 20 flatbed seats in C-Class, 21 seats in the Premium Economy cabin, and 203 seats in Economy Class while the larger variant, the A330-300 will carry 30 flatbed seats in C-Class, 21 seats in the Premium Economy cabin, and 223 seats in Y-Class. \nGoing by list prices, both Airbus and RwandAir declined to put the transaction value on record, this deal is worth about US$550 million, and the finance for the deal has been provided by the PTA bank, making it a purely African-financed purchase. It is, however, understood that RwandAir negotiated an excellent package deal from Airbus, a manufacturer keen to increase its African presence and, therefore, no doubt willing to make major financial concessions vis-a-vis the published prices for this aircraft type. \nRwanda’s Minister of State for Infrastructure, Dr. Alexis Nzahabwanimana, when addressing the representatives of Airbus, Rolls Royce, members of the RwandAir management and Board of Directors, invited guests from the Rwandan business community, and the media, congratulated the airline for the sterling work done before delivering President Kagame’s assurance that RwandAir would continue to receive the fullest support of the government as a key strategic asset aimed to ensure connectivity in the region, across Africa, and from next year beyond. \nThe airline’s CEO, John Mirenge, when speaking to this correspondent after the function, confirmed that the two wide-body aircraft will be deployed on a route to China, very likely Guangzhou, a route to India with Mumbai as the logical destination, and one, perhaps two destinations in Europe, maybe combining Frankfurt and London although this is mere speculation at this stage before a detailed route analysis has been carried out. \nMr. John Mirenge then went on to break further news that the airline had signed a firm purchase for two more B737-800NG SkyInteriors with Boeing, both aircraft also due for delivery in 2016. \nThis will bring the fleet size from the present 8 aircraft to 12 overall, making RwandAir one of the fastest-growing airlines in Africa and certainly the one with the youngest fleet on the continent. \nThese two additional medium-distance jets will allow RwandAir to widen its reach across the continent by adding both destinations and upping frequencies to key cities, where demand for seats justifies extra flights. All flights from the region and from across Africa are expected to feed into the wide-body intercontinental flights with passengers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T04:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T05:11:34.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
