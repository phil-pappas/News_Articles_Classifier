Tom Cruise's Hollywood Hills Mega-Compound", "locations": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "The box office legend and notorious Scientologist just sold his expansive estate, located in the glamorous Hollywood Hills neighborhood in Los Angeles, for a cool $11.4 million. The compound is actually two different properties, spread out over 2.5 acres . Because, hey, when you’re Tom Cruise, you do what you want.The first property is a three-bed, five-bath European-style villa perched on a knoll. Protected by tall gates and a long private driveway (Cruise isn’t a fan of the prying eyes of the paparazzi), the home features walls of glass overlooking the Los Angeles cityscape. An Italian farmhouse–style kitchen has up-to-date appliances, while each of the bedrooms provides the utmost luxury, equipped with its very own en-suite bathroom. Measuring 4,965 square feet, the expansive yet welcoming home features wide-plank oak floors and smooth Venetian plaster walls. The second property is a seven-bed, seven-and-a-half-bath home. With 1,742 square feet of space, the house is connected to the rest of the estate by stone driveways and walking paths. An additional stone building can be converted into a wine cellar or tasting room. Step outdoors, and you’re greeted by the ultimate entertaining space: An outdoor patio includes a lagoon-style heated pool with a spa and waterfall. Cruise bought this second home for $1.8 million just a few months after purchasing the first property back in 2005 for $9.85 million. Talk about some Risky Business. …If this piece of Los Angeles real estate doesn't strike your fancy, then you’re in luck: The Top Gun star also has two other properties currently on the market. First, there’s the Beverly Hills mega-estate that he lived in with ex-wife Joey Potter, er, Katie Holmes, which they paid $30.5 million for in 2007. That 10,286-square-foot manor is a seven-bed, nine-bath beauty in one of America’s most highly coveted neighborhoods. And then there’s Cruise’s quaint Telluride, CO home for sale, located in the Beverly Hills of the Rocky Mountains. That picturesque home, nestled amid nearly 300 acres of rolling meadowlands, can be yours for just $59 million. Images courtesy of Keller Williams Beverly Hills (via The MLS).
