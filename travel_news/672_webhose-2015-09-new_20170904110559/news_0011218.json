There's no reason to let a little heat spoil your fun. Refreshing float tours can fulfill your need for adventure and comfort. Choose a tour that floats along the smooth water area of the Colorado River, and since there are no rapids, these tours are suitable for everyone over the age of 4. These 1-day Grand Canyon rafting tours depart every day at the South Rim, but they fill up fast, so be sure to book your tour in advance. Getting Started You'll begin your tour at the Grand Canyon National Park airport which is located near the South Rim in Tusayan, Arizona. Different packages are available. If you choose the basic tour, you'll ride to Glen Canyon Dam by bus, which is a 2 1/2 hour trip. You'll also get transportation to the Grand Canyon Village and Maswik Lodge. The deluxe package is only an hour and carries people by airplane for beautiful sights along the way. Also, for some added adventure, the deluxe tour allows you to tour the canyon by Jeep, including visiting the Horseshoe Bend slot canyons. This part of the canyon has colorful sandstone and eerie slopes and curves, so you don't want to miss the chance to see it. South Rim The river portion of your tour begins at the base of the Glen Canyon Dam. These tours take up most of the day since they leave at 7 am and return at 5 pm. You'll ride on a 19-passenger motorized pontoon raft that is stable and safe for kids 4 and older. The raft is operated by a skilled captain, who is also able to tell you interesting bits and pieces about the history of the region. Beautiful Horseshoe Bend One of the beautiful sights on your trip include scenic Horseshoe Bend. Then your raft will stop at a few different beaches, including one where you can see ancient Native American petroglyphs on the canyon rocks. These drawings date back 800 years to the ancestors of today's Pueblo Indians. Finding the beach and the petroglyphs is difficult unless you know the area, so having an experienced guide operate the boat is a big plus. Also, don't forget to bring along your swimsuit because the clear, cool waters of the Colorado River are very inviting on a hot summer day. Wear protective shoes such as tennis shoes or swim shoes so you can hike and explore the area by foot too. Sunscreen and a protective hat is good to have for protection from the sun. It's also a good idea to bring along a jacket and a lightweight shirt with long sleeves, and you'll probably want dry clothes to change into when you're finished swimming for the day. Lee's Ferry After the rejuvenating beauty of Horseshoe Bend, you will come to Lee's Ferry. This is where the smooth water tours end and the whitewater tours begin, and it was once a Mormon settlement and fort. Lee's Ferry also offers a visit to the Cameron Trading Post. It was established in 1916 and you'll find beautiful Native American crafts here. There is also a store to visit, a restaurant, and a beautiful garden to stroll in along sandstone paths. This gives you the opportunity to relax and get ready for the trip back to Tusayan. Grand Canyon Rafting Is The Ideal Summer Activity These floating tours are really the best way to keep cool and see all the sites. They are fun for adults and kids alike. Deluxe tours cost more but save you the basic tour's long road trip, with a short enjoyable flight to the Grand Canyon. These tours are so popular, they sell out fast, so be sure to book yours as soon as possible.
