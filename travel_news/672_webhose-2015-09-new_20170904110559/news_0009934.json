It focuses greatly on the rapidly developing nations of the Asia Pacific and ties with Australia’s strategies, acquisitions, assessments and technologies within the genre.\nA significant element of the event is its associated exhibition set to feature some 400+ exhibitors with more than 25% being from international companies and organisations. This component alone affords our local exhibition and display companies a huge opportunity with the average exhibition booth from an international exhibitor worth more than $20,000 to the local industry.\n“Adelaide being named as the host city for Land Forces 2016 Exposition is a great win for us and is the result of a rather intense national bidding campaign by the Bureau on behalf of South Australia to ensure it didn’t end up on the eastern seaboard.\n“The win consolidates recent announcements regarding South Australia’s defense industry and strengthens our position as a leading defence state. The event ­– which has never been hosted in SA before, supports the key objectives of Defence SA, and aligns with 5 of the Premier’s 10 economic priorities” said Adelaide Convention Bureau CEO Damien Kitto.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T14:15:50.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
