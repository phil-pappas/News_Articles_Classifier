Gently reducing speed to increase the distance from the vehicle in front gives me an opportunity to make an safe manouvre to get the tailgater off my back bumper. I'd rather he was in front so I can keep well away from him but drivers making bad moves under pressure is likely to cause a crash. Who's talking about brake testing?

Report Hector2004 BeyondImagination 8:37pm Mon 28 Sep 15 \nOf course this is situation related and I'm in no way condoning tail-gating but in many cases, people create their own problems. They believe that they are safe because they're slow and that is nearly never the case. Speed should be appropriate for the road and conditions; too slow can be as dangerous as too fast. You should also be in lane one unless you're overtaking. Of course this is situation related and I'm in no way condoning tail-gating but in many cases, people create their own problems.

If you are in lane one and someone is tailgating you, then that guy is an idiot because they can go into lane 1 or 2 to overtake you. However, I think tailgating in lane 1 is extremely rare. If you are being tailgated in lane 2, move over to lane 1 or hit the gas. If you are being tailgated in lane 3, then you are an idiot because we all know that lanes 2 and 3 are for overtaking, but lane 3 is unofficially considered to be the \"fast\" lane. You are not a policeman and it is not your job to slow people down. If someone wants to do 80, 90, 100mph or more in lane 3 - move over and let them speed, if they get caught it will be their problem. People hogging lanes 2 and 3 are just as bad as the tailgators.

Enough of the driving arguements. I havent seen one person say anythin about the poor people involved. My hubby came back in this morning for a sandwiches n left moments later... he witnessed the dust fly and smoke and every1 stopped. He sat til emergency service arrived n all traffic only had hard shoulder to use. All 3 lanes were shut at that point. Im so glad he came back in n wasnt involved. However he often videos his commute n it looks extremly nasty as he past. My thoughts are with those injured.
