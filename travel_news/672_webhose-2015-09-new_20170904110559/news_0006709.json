Thousands of spectators are expected to travel to the Millennium Stadium where the game will kick off at 16:45 BST on Wednesday.\nArriva Trains Wales have issued a public statement:\nAll public transport will be extremely busy. Use the earliest available train and allow plenty of extra time for journeys to and from Cardiff. Many trains will be full and all standing room will be used. We advise against non-essential travel on Wednesday afternoon and evening.\nAfter the match, return to the train station as quickly as possible. For customer safety, a queuing system will operate for entry into Cardiff Central Rail Station. Please be aware that waiting times may be up to 2 hours. This queuing system is the safest and most effective way to enable everyone to board the right train. Please use warm, weatherproof clothing.\nPlease be patient â€“ Arriva Trains Wales, Great Western Railways and CrossCountry will be operating all available trains and doing everything possible to help you get home safely.
