Taking a ride through Point Washington State Forest with Arnett's Gulfside Trail Rides. (Phil Marty / Chicago Tribune) By Phil Marty Chicago Tribune It's a great time to indulge in Florida's South Walton. \nWhen you can chat with artists about their one-of-a-kind work in the morning, kayak on a secluded, calm lake in the afternoon and sit down to a casual fine-dining experience at night, you're in a very special place. \nThat's South Walton, an unexpected delight in the western reaches of Florida's Panhandle. \nThere's not really a town called South Walton. It's a collection of 16 unique Walton County communities sprinkled along 26 miles of white-sand beaches that border the Gulf of Mexico, with expansive Choctawhatschee Bay on the backside. 8 \nFor a narrow spit of land, it has an amazingly varied number of attractions. Local officials proudly point out that 40 percent of the land in South Walton is in conservation, which includes four state parks and the 15,000-acre Point Washington State Forest. There also are 15 coastal dune lakes, a natural phenomenon found in just a few places in the world. There's also an 18-mile paved bike trail that runs along Scenic Highway 30A, which hugs the Gulf Coast, linking South Walton's disparate neighborhoods. \nAdding to the charm of the area are myriad dining options, ranging from white-tablecloth seafood and steak places to Airstream Row, a collection of \"food trucks\" housed in Airstream trailers in the Seaside community. \nThe cultural scene is well represented with special events throughout the year, including — just during our three days there — a film festival and a wine festival. And the arts community is thriving. \nAt Shops of Grayton, just off 30A on South County Highway 283, my companion, Patti, and I browsed the shops/workshops of artists and craftspeople during our visit in early November last year. 0 \nMary Hong, the 2014 South Walton Artist of the Year, got her art degree from the University of Wisconsin but creates her unusual glasswork in South Walton these days. As with most creative types, her work continues to evolve, but much of it involves painting on canvas and then adding in glass recycled from a variety of sources. A piece she showed us included glass salvaged from a broken shower door. \nHong also offers classes where budding artists can make their own glass pieces under her tutelage. \nThose artist shops are part of Grayton Beach, one of South Walton's 16 neighborhoods and one that's been tagged with the slogan \"Grayton — Nice Dogs, Strange People.\" \nGrayton has more of an Old Florida vibe to it, with many older houses/cottages, and restaurants and bars that feel like a blast from the past. One evening as we waited for sunset, we sat outside at The Red Bar having drinks while '60s music floated out the door. Then we walked to the beach, where lucky residents drove their trucks on the sand thanks to winning a lottery for a permit. Kids running along the beach and a family having portraits shot were silhouetted against a reddish-orange sky as a big golden sun sank into the Gulf. \nIn contrast to Grayton, some of South Walton's communities are more formal. We stayed at WaterColor, a large resort set among trees and boasting all of the usual resort amenities. The design of the buildings has been done very tastefully and gives a feeling of a community, not just a bunch of condo buildings. \nAs we walked the beach at WaterColor one morning, I thought how appropriate that name is. The sky and the waters of the gulf were very subtly shaded with pale blues and greens and pastel pinks. \nJust down the beach from Watercolor is Seaside, a master-planned community dating from the late 1940s and famed as the main filming location for \"The Truman Show.\" The town is an architectural delight because individual houses were required to have original designs, and they represent a wide range of style periods. We whiled away part of an afternoon here at the annual Seeing Red Wine Festival, featuring wines from around the world, foods from around the area and live music. \nAt WaterColor we took out kayaks and pretty much had Western Lake to ourselves as we enjoyed the sun and the breezes and a variety of bird life. Western is one of those coastal dune lakes that are primarily fresh water though separated from the salt water of the Gulf by a narrow sand berm. Occasionally the berm is breached, usually during heavy rains, and this lets fresh water flow to the Gulf and some salt water into the lake before the berm repairs itself. The brackish water left in the lakes is home to both freshwater and saltwater species. \nAt lunch another day we visited Santa Rosa Beach, where we dined at Vue on 30A (850-267-2305, www.vueon30a.com ) right above the beach. Celebrity chef Giovanni Filippone, who's been on the culinary reality show \"Hell's Kitchen,\" turns out some marvelous food here. \nWe watched the sparkling surf roll in and butterflies flit among the wildflowers and sea oats while we gorged on small plates that ranged from scallop ceviche and venison wrapped with bacon to pistachio-crusted grouper and three-cheese grilled cheese sandwiches with tomato basil soup. All delicious. \nThere was more during our brief stay: horseback riding in the state forest; hunkering down in the cool night air to watch fascinating documentary films during the Mountainfilm on Tour presentation from Telluride, Colo.; eating way too much good food at white-tablecloth and no-tablecloth eateries. \nWho'd have known Panhandling could be such fun? \nPhil Marty if a freelance reporter. \nIf you go \nGetting there: South Walton is on the Gulf shores of Florida's Panhandle, between Pensacola and Panama City Beach, both of which have airports served by major airlines. \nWhen to go : South Walton's prime seasons are Memorial Day to Labor Day and spring break, but we visited in early November, which is ideal. Temps during the day were generally in the 70s, dipping into the 40s or 50s at night. Crowds were minimal. \nLodging: We stayed at WaterColor, where you can find vacation homes, cottages or condo-type rentals with a wide range of prices depending on date. Three nights in a luxurious one-bedroom condo with a full kitchen similar to where we stayed will run about $1,200, including taxes and fees for the same time period this year. 888-991-8088, www.watercolorvacationhomes.com \nSouth Walton has about 11,000 accommodations, which can be searched on the tourism site listed below. \nDining: In addition to restaurants mentioned in the main story, we had memorable meals at: \n•Seagar's Prime Steaks & Seafood in the Hilton Sandestin Beach Golf Resort & Spa, Miramar Beach. 850-622-1500, www.seagars.com \nGeorge's at Alys Beach, 30 Castle Harbour Drive, Alys Beach, 850-641-0017, www.georgesatalysbeach.net \nStinky's Fish Camp, 5994 County Road 30A, Santa Rosa Beach, 850-267-3053, www.stinkysfishcamp.com \nInfo: South Walton Tourism, 800-822-6877, www.visitsouthwalton.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T00:27:12.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
