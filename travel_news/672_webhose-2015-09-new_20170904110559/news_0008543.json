Comprised of three OUTFRONT billboards located throughout the county, the newly redesigned casino custom built channel cut backlit letters created to be posted on the boards spelling out one of three words in the casino's new branding message: \"Play.Win.Together.\" Large, custom built three-dimensional props add an exciting element to these installations and help illustrate the theme of each billboard.\n\"Though outdoor billboard advertising is by no means a new form of communicating brand messaging, the methods that have been used in the San Diego market have become stale, especially in the local gaming industry,\" said Dan Morales , director of marketing at Sycuan Casino. \"We saw this as an opportunity to raise the bar not only in our category but in the market at large. And, harmoniously, extend the message of our brand.\"\nThe campaign is a slice of life in San Diego , featuring the close connection Sycuan Casino has to the community. Each of the OUTFRONT boards has a unique design, with no artistic duplication from board to board. One of the \"Play\" boards that appears on eastbound Interstate-8 includes a giant baseball bat and ball cap which pays homage to the city's pro-baseball team, the San Diego Padres. The \"Win\" board that appears on State Route 94, includes enormous hundred dollar bills, reminding commuters that Sycuan is a nearby destination for them to win big. And, the \"Together\" board, which appears on State Route 67, includes two oversized surfboards, a beach ball and sunglasses â€“ a tribute to America's Finest City.\n\"We are thrilled to debut such vibrant billboards in the San Diego area,\" said Clive Punter , EVP and Chief Revenue Officer. \"Our spectacular locations in San Diego provide excellent visibility for Sycuan, and we are delighted to be their out-of-home partner. Out-of-home is a great vehicle for casinos and it's great to see Sycuan really standing out with bold bright branding. That's what works best in out-of-home.\"\nThe organically grown campaign was executed in-house at Sycuan Casino, from the conceptual stage to production, and installation was provided by OUTFRONT Media. The campaign also launched with a 60-second TV commercial, created by a production team including Oscar-winning cinematographer Russell Carpenter (1998, Best Cinematography, \"Titanic') and three 30-second radio spots voiced by iconic San Diegans Bill Walton (NBA Hall of Famer) and Steve Garvey (San Diego Padres Playoff hero).\nAbout OUTFRONT Media Inc.\nOUTFRONT Media (NYSE: OUT), formerly CBS Outdoor, is one of the largest out-of-home media companies in the Americas and has a major presence in top markets throughout the United States , Canada , Mexico and South America .
