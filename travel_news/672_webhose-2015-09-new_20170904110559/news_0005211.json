Texas 114): eatzis.com . \n(A Whole Foods will open about the same time in the Waterside shops at Bryant Irvin Road and Arborlawn Drive.) Two weeks to Market \nYes, some restaurants closed in West 7th. \nBut that left space for newcomers, like Market + Table . \nTechnically, chef Kalen Morgenstern ’s cafe and takeout shop will be a makeover of the old Tillman’s. But when it opens in about two weeks, diners will find a new layout and menu, featuring breakfast, lunch and dinner daily, coffees, fresh juices and takeout. \nWatch for Market + Table at 2933 Crockett St., 817-850-9255 ; fwmarketandtable.com . More than pumpkin pie \nFall is baking season. \nSo the Black Rooster Bakery will have a new menu of sandwiches, pies and cakes. \nThe Rooster’s fall menu will include German chocolate cake, pumpkin-pecan bourbon cake, caramel-apple tarts and the ubiquitous pumpkin flavor, but in pumpkin-chocolate chip bars. \nLunch items will include a turkey-goat cheese-cranberry croissant. \nThe Rooster opens at 7 a.m. Tuesdays through Fridays, 8 a.m. Saturdays, so keep it in mind for early TCU football games; 2430 Forest Park Blvd., 817-924-1600 , blackroosterbakery.net . Thurber truffle \nThe new Thurber Mingus , winner of several upsets in the DFW.com Burger Battle judging, continues to expand its menu. \nThe restaurant has added a lengua taco, and a pecan truffle-wild mushroom ragout burger with lemon chevre. \nIf that doesn’t sound like anything you’ve ever tried in small-town Thurber or Mingus, try the city version at 4400 White Settlement Road, 817-570-0537 ; thurbermingus.com . \nThe restaurant is also showing family movies on Tuesdays. Early bird gets the taco \nReaders liked the recent mention of Mi Cocina ’s early lunch hours, so here’s more. \nThe Sundance Square location opens at 10:30 a.m. daily for those too hungry or busy to wait. \nOther 10:30 lunch stops: tiny Bailey’s Barbecue downtown, and Boomerjack’s , Fred’s Texas Cafe , Pei Wei or Freebirds on West Seventh. \nBud Kennedy: 817-390-7538 , bud@star-telegram.com , @EatsBeat .
