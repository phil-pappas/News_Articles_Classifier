Boston residents and visitors can now schedule and enjoy a five-star, spa-quality Zeel Massage in the privacy and convenience of their own home, hotel, workplace, or event.\n“Boston is the perfect home for Zeel,” said Samer Hamadeh, founder and CEO of Zeel. “Boston is one of the most important tech centers of the United States, and Bostonians are smart, busy, and health-conscious – the perfect customers for Zeel’s ultra-convenient, top-quality massage offering. We’re excited to become part of the Boston wellness community and look forward to delivering Massage On Demand in Massachusetts.”\nWith Zeel, the massage comes to you – eliminating the need for travel. Zeel Massages can be booked through the Zeel app for iPhone and Android and on zeel.com, and are available for start times as early as 8 am and as late as 10:30 pm, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Customers may schedule a Zeel Massage in as little as an hour in advance, or up to a month ahead of time. Massage options include Swedish, deep tissue, prenatal, sports, and couples massage; 60-minute, 75-minute, and 90-minute massages are available. The therapist brings a table and supplies – the customer just needs to open the door. All Zeel Massage Therapists are fully vetted, experienced, background-checked, and licensed in their state of practice.\nZeel also offers the first and only in-home premium massage membership, Massage Zeelot, which includes a Zeel Massage a month for a year, a professional-grade massage table, and many other features and benefits. Zeel Chair Massage, perfect for workplaces, conventions, and events, is available nationwide.\nZeel Massage On Demand first became available in December 2012 in New York City. With month-over-month double-digit growth in both the number of massages booked and the number of overall customers, Zeel is the first, largest, and fastest-growing on-demand massage company in the United States. Zeel is also available in the NYC Tri-State area, South Florida, Southern California, Chicago, and the San Francisco Bay Area.\nSource:- Zeel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T18:09:27.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
