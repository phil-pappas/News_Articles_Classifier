The increase in total revenues had a direct flow through to the bottom line with GOPPAR increasing 10 percent to $56.67. \nJeddah hotels witnessed a 6.5 percent increase in occupancy to 80.9 percent in July, allowing hoteliers to yield a 3.5 percent rise in ARR to $315.00 driving a 12.5 percent growth in RevPAR to $254.67. \nSofter food and beverage revenues had an impact on TRevPAR performance, but it was still 2.7 percent higher than last year. Despite a minimal increase in operating expenses, the profitability of Jeddah hotels mimicked the growth in RevPAR with GOPPAR expanding 2.8 percent to $197.00.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T14:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T18:29:52.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
