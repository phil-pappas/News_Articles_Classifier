There will also be demonstrations and displays celebrating the remarkable heritage of the Gorge in the market square.\nNew for 2015 is an on-site art competition to celebrate how the Iron Bridge has been represented by artists over the centuries. Artists must complete a piece during the five hours of the Festival, which depicts the Bridge and its surroundings in their own style. Judging will take place on the day with the winner being awarded a £200 prize; their artwork will also be exhibited at Telford & Wrekin Council’s main office until the end of the year.\nWith the world famous Iron Bridge forming the backdrop, the Festival will be a great celebration of the area’s designation as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1986.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T18:23:08.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
