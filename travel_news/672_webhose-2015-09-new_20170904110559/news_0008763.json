No one was immediately available for comment at the coastguard. \nDogan news agency said the group was traveling to Kos in a 20-metre (66-foot) wooden boat. Turkey houses more than 2 million refugees and tens of thousands have taken boats from its coast on their way to Europe. \nOn Sunday 34 people died including 15 babies and children when another wooden boat capsized off the Greek island of Farmakonisi. \nIn Europe's worst migration crisis since World War Two the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR expects at least 850000 people to head to the continent this year many of them fleeing Syria's four-year civil war. \nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T17:58:59.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
