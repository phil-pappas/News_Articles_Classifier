The famous road along the Victorian coastline is one of the world’s great drives and a key part of a trip to the state. It includes some of the great landmarks such as Bells Beach, the 12 Apostles, Loch Ard Gorge. It also takes you to Otways National Park, where you can immerse yourself in an ancient land, walk among giant tree ferns and discover beautiful waterfalls and to Kennett River to see koalas in the wild. But you wouldn’t want to miss the Mornington Peninsula on a culinary tour. So, after exploring Melbourne, instead of heading west down the coast, you can slingshot down the eastern side of Port Phillip Bay, take the ferry across to the Bellarine Peninsula and then join the Great Ocean Road. It’s hard to leave Melbourne in the first place though. With its multi-cultural heritage and an easy call on superb ingredients – the finest dairy and meat products, fish from just offshore and superb local wines – the city has a justifiable reputation as Australia's culinary capital. Melbourne’s colourful arcades and alleyways are crammed with basements and rooftop terraces serving fantastically innovative dishes. Easily explored on foot or by bicycle, by free “circle” tram or even on the back of a Harley Davidson motorbike, the city has the Yarra River at its heart, perfect for al fresco dining. Or make a reservation on the Colonial Tramcar Restaurant for food with a view and enjoy fine dining as you cruise the city streets in a restored burgundy tramcar. Laid-back leisure: find fabulous wines along the Great Southern Touring Route Even better, coincide your visit with the Melbourne Food and Wine Festival in March and experience the unforgettable events that fill Melbourne’s network of laneways, restaurants, bars, cosy basements and rooftops, and spills into regional Victoria. The 17-day festival attracts some 250,000 visitors each year. But Melbourne is just the beginning of your great gourmet adventure and the Mornington Peninsula beckons... So head south. Recently the region has come into its own as one of Australia’s leading wine producers, so make sure to knock on a cellar door or two. Usually there is a lovely, window-framed view over the rolling, vine-strung hills. And there’s a novel way to explore, too. By horse. Horseback Winery Tours offers rides linking tastings along trails that meander over the hills, through the woods and vineyards. Dismount for a tasting. (They’ll transport any purchases you make to the finish point of the ride.) If you haven’t spotted Australian wildlife along the route, then the Ballarat Wildlife Park is a place to catch kangaroos, wallabies and koalas As you descend off the hills, the peninsula tapers to the west, through the seaside towns of Rye, Blairgowrie and Sorrento, with their streetside cafés and eateries. The many holiday villas give them a leisurely feel, like a Cornwall in the sunshine. (On any rare less sunny days you can head straight for Peninsula Hot Springs, with their baths that meander among the trees, bubbling spas, dry saunas and hammams, all using water that emerges from the ground at 54C). On the calm and shallow waters of the bay there are water sports. BayPlay offers stand up paddleboard, sea kayaking tours along Point Nepean and snorkel trips in pursuit of the extraordinary leafy sea dragon, a colourful relative of the sea-horse that has clearly been designed by Monty Python. Sun, sea and sand: enjoy a quiet stroll along the beach in Mornington The pincer that nearly closes the mouth of Port Phillip Bay onto Mornington is the Bellarine – the car ferry carries you across to Queenscliff in 40 minutes. And there’s no shortage of wine here either. We all love a pinot noir nowadays. The velvetiest, richest and most satisfying I have tasted comes from Scotchmans Hill. However, for an elegant lunch with paired wines and a lovely view over the bay, try Jack Rabbit Vineyard. The dishes use local ingredients, from crayfish to wild clover lamb served with broccolini or witlof salad, that turn tiny somersaults on your tongue. From here, head south to the coast, where the waterfront towns sit on superb white-sand beaches – Ocean Grove, Barwon Heads and Torquay. Mussels are the favoured seafood dish hereabouts. The most famous beach of them all is Bells Beach, a lovely stretch of sand, which makes a fantastic walk. It was calm the day I visited, but Bells Beach is home to some of the great surfing waves, rollers that thunder in off the Southern Ocean. They have held surfing competitions here since 1961. And here you join the Great Ocean Road proper. It strikes off along the coastline, full of drama – green heights plunge into the raging Southern Ocean, a rich royal blue often flecked with white caps, on your left. The best way to see the 12 Apostles is from a helicopter. Their creamy-yellow colour stands out against the surreal turquoise of the shallow sea At moments the road is suspended hundreds of feet above the water, clinging onto clifftops and contouring around the massive bulk of shoreside hills, and next you glide down to the seafront, where the view is even better – headlands that outreach one another, their skirts marked white with surf, for tens of miles. In the bays there are miles of blonde sand in electrifyingly blue water. A favourite stop is at Apollo Bay, where there are holiday homes and sailing boats. And, most importantly, a fishing fleet, which means the freshest imaginable catch for delectable fish and chips with a wonderful view. Not all the culinary activity is on the coast, though. Inland on Highway 1, close to a township called Birregurra, is a superb restaurant by the name of Brae, in which Dan Hunter selects from his 40-acre organic garden and from the best local suppliers in order to create magic. Back at Apollo Bay the Great Ocean Walk, a long-distance walking path, heads west along the coast, passing through Cape Otway National Park. The hike can be joined at several places, so you’ve no need to walk the whole thing (that’ll take eight days anyway), but it is certainly worth a moment to explore a section, among the stringy bark eucalypts with their agonised branches and the weird, weird “grass trees”, which stand 4ft high like a lurid green, very hairy troll. Hanging around: visit the koalas at the Ballarat Wildlife Park It’s also a good opportunity to see some of Australia’s oddest wildlife, the echidna, though this shy creature will burrow straight into the ground when it realises you’re coming. The Great Ocean Road cuts inland for a while, but re-emerges in time for Victoria’s most famous site, the 12 Apostles. These sandstone stacks stand marooned just offshore, where the sea thrashes all around them, eroding and undermining them. Unexpectedly, there are eight of them (since the ninth collapsed in 2005), but they are spectacular. The best way to see them, without a doubt, is from a helicopter. Their creamy-yellow colour stands out as delicious as cake against the surreal turquoise of the shallow sea. At Port Fairy the Great Southern takes you into the seemingly never-ending outback. Eventually, the land around you crumples into uplands and then mountains, the Grampians. At Dunkeld the Royal Mail Hotel is an unexpected enclave of sophisticated modernity and comfort. It has a delectable chef ’s tasting menu with matched wines. The Grampians National Park nearby, besides having peaks and waterfalls to hike, is the site of important Aboriginal culture. There are displays at the Brambuk Centre in Halls Gap, but among the 60 sites there are several shelters where Aboriginal artwork is visible. The Billimina shelter has some 2,500 ochre motifs. From Dunkeld the Great Southern Touring Route completes the loop, heading east back to Melbourne, though there are certainly places worth stopping at along the way. In Victoria’s spa country, the land is laced with hot springs. At Daylesford you will find the Lakeside Hotel with its award-winning Salus spa. Ballarat was the site of a gold rush in the 1850s and you can see the story retold at Sovereign Hill, a restored mining town, and in an accessible mine. And if you haven’t spotted the archetypal Australian wildlife along the route, then the Ballarat Wildlife Park is a place to catch kangaroos, wallabies and koalas, and even to make friends with a wombat.
