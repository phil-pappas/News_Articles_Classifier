Since many people are using the holiday to squeeze in one last summer trip, the tours will sell out quickly. Las Vegas The tour planes that fly out of Las Vegas go to the South Rim or the West Rim. The flight time to reach the West Rim is just 30 minutes, while the South rim is a 60-minute flight. When you consider it can take almost six hours to drive to the South Rim, you save quite a bit of time. You can choose from two basic tour types. One tour stays in the air and the other lands at the canyon. Both will fly you above Lake Mead, Hoover Dam and the Colorado River, before flying over the canyon. The landing tours stop over at the Grand Canyon so you can enjoy some land activities there for a while, but the air-only tours just fly over the canyon before heading back to Vegas. The air tour offers fantastic views and it is the most affordable option, which is great when you're on a budget. However, you'll see more if you do a landing tour. One of the best is the flight from Vegas that lands at the West Rim. This allows you to take a helicopter ride to the base of the canyon, and then travel on a boat down the Colorado River. Another landing tour option is to buy VIP passes to the famous Skywalk. The Skywalk is an immense glass bridge that you can walk on and stand 70 feet past the edge of the rim. When you look through the glass floor you can peer down to the canyon bottom 4000 feet below you. It's scary and thrilling at the same time. South Rim From the South Rim, you can take a 45-minute tour. The tour originates from the Grand Canyon National Park Airport, which is situated in Tusayan, AZ. This tour flies over to the eastern border of the park and up to the North Rim. Then you'll head back to the South Rim and have witnessed 75% of the park after all is said and done. The airplane tours fly on sightseeing aircraft that carry as many as 19 people per tour. There are two FAA certified pilots on each plane to ensure a safe flight. You'll be comfortable on the plane too. The plane is designed so the wings don't obstruct anyone's view through the large windows and the cabin is roomy for your comfort. You can feel confident when you book your tour that you'll have the best views possible from one of the airplanes. Benefits When you take an airplane tour, you will fly along the same flight path as the tour helicopters. The difference is they are cheaper and will accommodate more people, while flying at a higher altitude. If you prefer a more intimate tour, then you can choose to fly on a smaller chopper. However, you'll pay about 50 percent more if you do. Labor Day weekend is always one of the busiest times at the Grand Canyon. Therefore, you need to buy your tour early, and you can do it online. Don't wait until the last minute or even until a day or two in advance. The seats will probably be sold out if you wait, and if you luck out and find some, you'll have to pay a lot more money for them. To Conclude Now that you know a little about Grand Canyon plane tours over Labor Day, it's time to start planning your trip. Choose the rim you want to see and buy your tour as soon as you can. When you do it online and in advance, you're guaranteed to have an experience you'll never forget, without missing out on your air tours because you waited too long.
