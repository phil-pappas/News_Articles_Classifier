The best photo and caption with the #ThailandStrongerTogether hashtag wins a return trip to Thailand. \n\n“We believe that that these people will become social media warriors, helping Thailand fight back against its detractors,” said Darryl Lee, GTA’s regional vice president, sales and marketing for Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa during the launch event yesterday in Bangkok. \n\nWhile the campaign is global in reach, it is especially targeted at “large-scale nearby markets\", said Lee. He also urged Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways to put on extra flights in anticipation for more visitors. \n\nPointing out that Thailand had received its 21st million visitor last week, Juthaporn Rerngronasa, deputy governor for international marketing at TAT, noted there was some weakness in markets such as Hong Kong and Japan, but said visitors numbers were “picking up”. \n\nWith this new campaign, TAT has expressed confidence that it will surpass its target of 28.8 million visitors by year-end.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T09:46:31.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
