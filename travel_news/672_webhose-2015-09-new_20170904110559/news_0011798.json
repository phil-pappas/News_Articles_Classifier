With around 85% of food items imported into the UAE, we believe that we can make a difference by introducing the Slow Food initiative in our hotels,” said Bernard Fantoli, Corporate Director of Food & Beverage, TIME Hotels.\n“The guidelines implemented at both hotels include a commitment to using 100% homemade products with no GMO, MSG or other artificial flavour enhancers; local sourcing of all ingredients/products up to a radius of 3,000 kilometres; and a focus on sourcing organic where possible,” he added.\nTIME’s Slow Food menu includes dishes such as labneh cheese with extra-virgin olive oil served with heirloom tomatoes and organic arugula; baked local shari fish with cucumber, carrots and beetroot in a zaatar-black olive sauce; free range chicken machbous with Emirati rice and a secret herb mix; and a delicious cream soufflé made with khidri dates, nuts and mountain honey.\nEach property was presented with the award at a ceremony attended by team members instrumental in getting the initiative up-and-running along with representatives from Slow Food Dubai, and invited guests.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T15:13:08.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
