But it isn’t so simple. The Delta is the entire alluvial sprawl that stretches northward of that mud in Louisiana, the floodplain beyond Natchez, emphatically flat above Vicksburg, almost the whole of a bulge of western Mississippi, enclosed in the east by the Yazoo River, all the way to Memphis. It is a definite route, as well; it is Highway 61. Continuing up that highway, past Fayette and Lorman again, I swung through Port Gibson, a town boasting that at least one road “looks much as it did in 1863”, and some buildings too – General Grant spared it, saying the town was “too beautiful to burn”. This was not the case with Vicksburg, just up the road, like Natchez a town on a bluff, but unlike Natchez it had been besieged, shelled constantly from Union barges on the river, in an assault that lasted 40 days. And the siege ended in a significant defeat, a humiliating surrender. The siege was still a memory. I joined eight strangers for lunch at the family-style Round Table at the Walnut Hills Restaurant in Vicksburg. Anyone at all could sit at the Round Table, among strangers or friends, and eat together. This bungalow on a side street had been recommended for its home cooking. Introducing myself, I said where I’d come from. “Set yourself down,” one man said. But an older woman muttered in a resentful way, “You know what you did to us?” • The battlefields of the American Civil War The Mississippi as it winds through Louisiana Photo: Fotolia/AP The memory had become a taunt. The others at the table, all of them local, and most of them strangers to each other, though chatting amiably, went silent, waiting for my reply. They knew she was referring to the long siege of Vicksburg by the Union army in 1864. By then I’d toured the town of Vicksburg, with its lovely antebellum houses and landmarks of the war; the battlefield took up most of the town, and I heard about the suffering. “This whole city is a grave,” Natasha Trethewey writes in her poem “Pilgrimage”, about a visit to the place. So I didn’t take the woman’s accusation lightly. I said, as though to a cranky child, “I personally did not do anything to you. The South seceded. The North responded. All’s well that ends well.” “You starved us,” the woman said. “You made us eat rats.” • A journey through American history with Telegraph correspondents This sort of response – sometimes heartfelt, sometimes a bitter joke, sometimes spoken with defiant nostalgia – is so commonly uttered in the South, always by whites, to a Northern visitor, that I learnt not to say, “That was 150 years ago,” but instead listened with sympathy, because conquered people feel helpless, and the proof of this is the monotony of their complaint. Their nagging on this point, ancient to me but fresh as today in their minds, gives the North – of which I was the embodiment that morning – a fiendish magnitude. So I commiserated, and asked some other questions. For example (I suggested), if the South had won the war, what would the national boundary of the Confederacy look like, and where would it end? How would we trade? Would the South have endured and still be backward-looking, with slaves and an aristocracy and a standing grey-uniformed army? How would that army have responded to international events, like the Spanish-American War and the Great War? And, assuming Hawaii had become a Union territory, how would the Confederate South have reacted to the bombing of Pearl Harbor? Soldiers planting the Union flag at Vicksburg Yet logic seldom overcomes the feelings of profound loss, or sentiment, or wounded pride. Much of the South still hurts because a great part of the South is still poor; and the air of defeat that I sensed keenly was like a reminder of the Civil War – the losses, the deaths, the gratuitous burnings, the surrender. The sense, too, or the delusion, that a golden age had ended with the war – of ease, of mansions, of slavery – when what had happened was that the vigour of the South had been exhausted in its failed bid to be separate, turning it upside down and impoverishing it, making it a bitter place of tombstones and memorials and ruins. “The South was created by the need to protect a peculiar institution from threats originating outside the region,” the Southern historian Sheldon Hackney writes in his essay “Southern Violence” (1969). Consequently, “the Southern identity has been linked from the first to a siege mentality”. Being Southern, he says, “involves a feeling of persecution at times, and a sense of being a passive, insignificant object of alien or external forces.” Among these forces he lists abolitionists, the Union army, carpetbaggers, Wall Street, civil rights agitators, the federal government, feminism, socialism, trade unionism, Darwinism, communism, atheism, daylight saving time, “and other by-products of modernity”. And writers like me, nature’s own subversives. • US road trip: the call of the South I often reflected that in the heart of Thomaston, Maine, under the tall maples and broad oaks, a Civil War soldier stands brooding on a granite block, and under him on the plinth, the inscription, To the Memory of Soldiers and Sailors 1861–1865, and One Country – One Flag. The 20th Maine Regiment, under the command of Colonel Joshua Chamberlain, in a heroic and decisive downhill bayonet charge against thousands of Confederates in the Battle of Little Round Top, helped turn the tide at Gettysburg. There are more than 150 such Civil War memorials in Maine towns, and a similar number in Massachusetts. Virtually every community of any size in New England has a war memorial. One of the oldest, erected in 1866, is the stark obelisk that stands on the green in Centerville, on Cape Cod, the four sides of the base listing the names of dead soldiers – this tiny seaside fishing village, just a few hundred souls then, lost 31 men in the Civil War. My town of Sandwich on the Cape, with a population of 4,500 in 1861, sent 240 of its young men to that war. Fifty-four of them were killed and many wounded. One of the Sandwich veterans was a black man, Joseph Wilson, a freed slave, who fought with the 54th Massachusetts Regiment (the first to have black soldiers) at the siege of Vicksburg, and found his way back to Cape Cod after the war, to tell the tale. Mississippi boasts a proud musical heritage But there is hardly a person today in Thomaston, Centerville, Sandwich, or elsewhere in New England who will mention that war, or even draw a visitor’s attention to the melancholy memorials on the village greens. After the woman had vented her feelings, I said something of this, and Quote: d the Chinese sage Lieh Tzu: “The reputation of a general is made on the corpses of 10,000 men.” When a Mexican in Charles Portis’s novel Gringos complains that the Yanquis took half his country in 1848, the narrator, Jimmy Burns, says, “They took all of mine in 1865. We can’t keep moping over it.” A younger woman said, “I was up north once. They talk a lot about the Revolutionary War up there. We never mention it here.” • Inside Newark's Civil War Centre “War is hell,” I said, and became acutely aware of the general I was quoting. I was glad when the conversation turned to food, and antiques, and the weather. We all ate together. That was a tradition of the Walnut Hills Round Table. There was room for a dozen people around the big table. Anyone could sit down, and the food was served buffet style on a lazy Susan: bowls of fried chicken, bowls of stew and potatoes, rice and gravy, platters of fried fish, bowls of beans and collard greens. The turntable meant that a degree of consideration had to be observed toward your fellow diners. And as I had learnt in my travels elsewhere, eating together is an occasion that humans have made into a peacemaking ritual; sharing food is sharing friendship, and so the talk of war subsided, and we spoke of the news of the day. Unemployment was a topic. “Jobs are scarce,” someone said. One of the diners was a man whose business had been selling farm machinery. He was retired now. He said, “Mechanisation has taken away all the jobs. I sold cotton pickers. The early ones only picked one row at a time, but even so, they did the work of 40 men. These days they can do six rows, your spindle picker. Some can do 12 rows. How can any field hand compete with that?” A war memorial in America's South Photo: Alamy “And tell them what they cost,” his wife said. “Half a million dollars, some of ’em. Some a lot more.” “That’s why no one’s working here.” The woman who had said “You made us eat rats” asked me if I’d travelled outside the United States. I said yes, and I recognised this question as a cue for me to respond by returning it, asking about her European travels, because a person – and especially a traveller – asks a question in order to give information and state an opinion. “Ever been to Bhutan?” means “I have been to Bhutan and I would enjoy telling you about my trip for the next hour or so.” “I’ve been over there,” the woman said. “Paris. London.” “What was it like?” one of the younger women inquired with enthusiasm. “Hated it. It was nothing.” The woman made a face. “America’s lots better.” This is an extract from Paul’s Theroux’s Deep South published by Penguin at £20.
