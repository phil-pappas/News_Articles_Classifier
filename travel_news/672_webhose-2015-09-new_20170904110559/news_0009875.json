ALEXANDRE MENEGHINI/REUTERS \nCliches about Cuba as frozen in time - with vintage cars, prestigious cigars and crumbling antiquities - gloss over that Cubans are educated and ravenous for opportunity. \nAnd a man with a dirt-floor shop across from a state-owned field of sugar cane re-engineers classic American autos into international hybrids. \n\"We find a way, always,\" promises a Cuban guide, with confidence. \nWith an easing of Cuba's internal controls and thawing relations with the United States, the island is stirring with expectation. In July, my wife made her third trip and I visited for the first time. \nThe blink of a flight from Tampa, Florida, to Havana takes 52 minutes and quickly reveals a country rendered otherworldly by isolation from the US and adherence to socialism. \nShortly after we arrive at Jose Marti airport, an immigration \"jefe\" with a radio pulls me aside for an interrogation over travel plans. It somewhat unsettles my Spanish-speaking wife, who must explain. \nApparently I stand out at 6 feet 4 inches on a plane of Cubans and Cuban-Americans. Our reception is a Latin version of going into East Berlin back in the Wall days. \nNext are women officers in uniforms of tight skirts and black-patterned stockings, and X-ray machines scanning bulging bags brought into the country. \nThen we push through doors into the steaming outside. A waiting crowd presses against barricades. It's clamorous, disorienting and begins the adventure. \nA 60-year-old Rambler takes 30 minutes to get us to Havana. \nThe first thing we notice is mesmerising and eclectic architecture, heavy on balconies, arches, iron railing and Spanish persuasions. Much of it is melting with disrepair. \nTrees and shrubs sprout from cracks in exterior walls above streets, competing with fluttering laundry. Tangled electric wires clutter foyers. Sewage drains to streets. \nYet cocooned within buildings condemnable elsewhere are homes and restaurants of refinement and elegance. Stairways rise from grimy chaos to immaculate calm of a casa particular, with rooms costing about US$35 (NZ$55) a night. \nUnisex bathrooms in La Guarida, royalty among paladares, or private restaurants, glow in purple-blue lighting. Food and service, at US$60 for starters through dessert for two, is surrealistic. \nYou want to pinch yourself: Este es Habana? \nExistence of such addresses, with hot water, toilets that flush, air conditioners that cool and artistic portraits of nudes, leaves me amazed over the effort and ingenuity they must have required of workers who often make US$1 or US$2 a day. \nA least one meal should be taken in a government-owned restaurant for perspective on socialist fare, though some do occupy the most venerable settings. \nBut paladares aren't hard to find, and a posh one in the embassy section of Havana features an arresting view of ocean and of adjoining resorts that began disintegrating years ago. \nLook toward Florida, toast the scenery and kiss your wife. Glance right and observe a Mad Max setting. It's a romantic combo of love and seaside desolation. \nIn Cuba, gritty and glamour go hand in hand. \nA 1954 Oldsmobile taxi, a gorgeous thing in azure, had its gas-guzzling V-8 replaced with a 1960s-era British diesel. It also was refitted with a Hyundai truck transmission and Mercedes disc brakes. It buzzes along like an agile tractor. \nA mechanic converts American classics into Cuban road warriors by fabricating parts and precisely welding engine compartments into new configurations. \nA German leans under a hood of one and proclaims with German authority: \"This isn't possible.\" \nThe aging diesels, however, belch thunderheads of exhaust, a noxious reminder Havana is urban in its peculiar, developing-nation ways. \nTap water isn't drinkable, Cubans say, and groceries aren't readily available. Street scamming goes on with cheap rum, cigars and something involving salsa and sex. A Bucanero beer costs about US$1 but dollars often aren't taken. \nTourists use the CUC, or \"kook,\" the peso traded for foreign currency worth a bit more than a buck. Official changers take 10 percent cuts, while the black market for money is sketchy. \nNarrow streets in the capital's old section may suggest \"Ghetto: danger!\" It's false alarm. \nCubans in the city live open lives, lacking air conditioning, and you may glance into windows and see Mom, Dad and the kids as if you were in their homes. \nThey aren't muggers but may ask where you are from: \"De que pais son?\" \nYou kind of don't want to fess up because they can get animated over Americans. \nHundreds of them in Havana line up each day to apply for a US visa despite little chance of getting one. \nThey will want to tell you about their sister who lives in Miami, a \"balsero\" father who rafted to Florida and lives in California, and a cousin in Georgia. \nThen they will press for why the United States won't take its foot off Cuban necks, especially given their fondness for their northern neighbor. \nPerhaps best of all in Cuba is how easy it is to connect with Cubans, which was prohibited not many years ago, and hear their take on US - Cuba relations. \n\"We l ve you,\" an amazed driver of a three-wheeled, bicycle taxi, or bicitaxi, proclaims when he realises his passengers are American. Another bicitaxi labors by, an American flag clipped to its handlebar. \nAmericans are rare among the Canadians, Europeans and Russians who come, say taxi drivers, for beer, rum and hot chicks at Varadero, Cuba's version of Cancun. \nWe encounter few free-ranging Americans and mostly tour groups such as underwater archaeologists and religious somebodies. \nIt's startling anybody loves Americans enough to proclaim it so loudly. Yet many Cubans aren't shy about complaining the US is punishing Cuba with its embargo. \n\"Why?\" implores a charismatic waiter serving a whole snapper at an elegant paladare filled with older Mexicans and young lovers. \nHe points out that 50,000 young Americans were killed in communist Vietnam. \"You made friends with Vietnam,\" he stresses. \"It is one of your most important trading partners in Asia.\" \nIn fact, no Cubans suggest the embargo stresses Cuban leaders. Many, possibly dozens, told us it stresses them personally. \n\"I'm 44 years old already,\" the waiter says. \"Why do we have to suffer?\" \nIt's not obvious if he is angry or acting. He has a Russian name, as do many Cubans. Looking at my snapper, I consider a safe answer. \nOtra cerveza, por favour. \nMany Cubans are well-travelled and talkative - to the point of pontificating - but are nervous about politics, even when knocking back Bucaneros. They imply negativity about Fidel Castro but won't articulate a culpable point. \nYou learn quickly Fidel is, or was, a demigod not to be messed with. Cubans revere and revile the bearded one. \nHe introduced water, electricity, free housing, free health care and free education. Literacy, life expectancy and infant mortality rival or better those in the US. \nAbout medical care, a guy in Playa Larga at the Bay of Pigs suggests \"sometimes it's better to pay.\" \nA guy in Havana makes a big show of appreciation that Fidel's brother, Raul, now in charge, has made ownership of cars and homes possible. \n\"Thank you, thank you, after 56 years,\" he pronounces in faux prayer. It's theatrical and hard to say if sarcasm or sincerity. \nA lot of Cubans have been jailed for political expression and everywhere is propaganda printed or painted on walls such as \"Patria o Muerte (Country or Death)!\" \nAfter sunset, however, politics and polemics soften along the photogenic Malecon sea wall, sitting shoulder to shoulder with Cubans in the fresh breeze that brushes across the Florida Strait from the direction of Florida. \nHorns of swanky convertibles that roll at night don't honk; they toot or trumpet. The moment is transcendent. \nIf you are not drawn to the understandable anger of Cuban-Americans of a certain age, who were terrorised, run out of the country and lost a way of life, you may want to admire and cheer for Cubans. \nTheir nation is adrenalized and vibrating in transition between the Castros and a country anxious to erupt. More affluence. More modernity. More Americans. More good and more bad. \nAfter it happens, and Marriotts and McDonald's brand an island within reach of a ferry ride, history surely will ask of the last decades: \"What was that about?\" \nTNS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T07:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T21:07:08.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
