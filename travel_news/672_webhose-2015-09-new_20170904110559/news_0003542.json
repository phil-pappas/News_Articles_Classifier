This resulted in few sparks at the nose wheel. There was no fire. All 146 passengers were evacuated safely and taken to terminal building. No passenger was injured,” the airliner said.\nRunway 27, where the aircraft had landed, has been cleared, it said, adding all passengers were being served dinner and taken care of.
