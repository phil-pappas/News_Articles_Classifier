The change may apply to several major probes including the alleged manipulation of financial markets by traders at global banks.\nThe change is a response to criticism from lawmakers and public-interest groups that the department had relied too much on big-dollar settlements with companies without bringing cases against those responsible for the misconduct.\nMost Read Stories Seahawks’ Russell Wilson buys $6.7 million waterfront mansion in Bellevue, report says Kam Chancellor speaks to NFL Network, says he’s willing ‘to meet the Seahawks halfway’ Empty classes, no talks as Seattle schools stalemate continues ‘Passport day’ coming up in Seattle Struggling Haggen files for bankruptcy protection, parts with Southwest co-CEO Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other lawmakers had faulted the Justice Department under Eric Holder, who stepped down as attorney general this year, for failing to send senior Wall Street executives to prison for wrongdoing tied to the 2008 financial crisis.\nYates, in an interview, said that the new policy ensures the department is doing all it can to target individuals, but there’s no guarantee executives will be going to prison.\n“We’re going to be doing everything we can to maximize the chances of being able to bring charges against individuals,” Yates said. “Time will tell what the results are in terms of the actual number of individual defendants.”\nYates’ predecessor, James Cole, supports the change but cautioned that investigations will take longer now. Successfully bringing charges against individuals usually involves “painstaking review” of thousands or even millions of documents to find sufficient evidence, he said.\n“Many times you’re not going to find the evidence needed to prosecute an individual,” said Cole, a partner at Sidley Austin in Washington, D.C.\nIn her remarks, Yates spoke about the difficulties of making cases against executives in large corporations where decision-making is spread among many people, but said it was the Justice Department’s responsibility to do so.\nOne way, she said, is to require that companies identify all individuals involved in the wrongdoing, regardless of their position, and provide evidence of misconduct. If a company doesn’t, then it won’t be eligible for a lower penalty for cooperating.\n“It’s all or nothing,” Yates said. “No more picking and choosing what gets disclosed. No more partial credit for cooperation that doesn’t include information about individuals.”\nCompanies could be reluctant to come forward and report misconduct if they can’t be assured credit even when they offer useful information, some former prosecutors said. Specifically, they said, the new policy doesn’t explain how disagreements over cooperation will be handled.\n“Why cooperate if there’s a good chance that we’re going to be deemed to have not fully cooperated,” said James Koukios, a former federal prosecutor now at Morrison & Foerster in Washington, D.C.\n“How are we supposed to deal with DOJ about whether a particular person did anything wrong? Now it seems if there’s a disagreement we could get bupkus.”\nThe memo, sent to prosecutors around the country, says settlements with companies won’t shield individuals from prosecution or civil liability except in “extraordinary circumstances” and with approval from top department officials.\nProsecutors will be required to explain why cases against individuals couldn’t be made by the time the statute of limitations expires. Decisions not to charge individuals involved in misconduct must be approved by the U.S. attorney or the top Justice Department official overseeing the investigation.\nThat shift may make it more difficult and time-consuming for companies to settle investigations because of the need to get approval from senior-level officials when individuals aren’t charged, lawyers at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton said in a note to clients.\nThe policy also underscores that senior managers at companies will be the primary targets in investigations, according to the firm.\nDepartment lawyers investigating civil cases, such as false claims, must also focus on individuals and shouldn’t be governed by a person’s ability to pay. These lawyers and criminal prosecutors also will be required to share information with one another.\nBloomberg reporter Greg Farrell in New York contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T12:44:55.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
