Here, in no particular order, he’s managed to narrow down five of his top India must-sees… Jodhpur, Rajasthan This huge, sprawling city is the second largest in Rajasthan, but it doesn’t have any of the anonymity you might expect from somewhere housing more than a million people – I found it had more heart, more soul than many other places I’ve visited. The ancient backstreets are simply fascinating – I could spend hours just pottering around, exploring, seeing where the city takes me. Of course, if you only have limited time here, I would suggest making your way up to the huge Mehrangarh Fort, perched high on a hill looking down over the old city below. Views from the towering walls are simply fantastic, not least because almost all the buildings in the streets below are painted various shades of blue – it’s quite a sight. Film buffs will also be enthralled to learn that parts of the 2012 Batman film, The Dark Knight Rises , were filmed here. Meenakshi Amman Temple: see incredible Hindu architecture Meenakshi Amman Temple, Madurai A visit to the fantastic temple of the goddess Meenakshi is an unforgettable experience – not least because of the incredible Hindu architecture, intricately carved and painted in a kaleidoscope of colours. My favourite part of this visit is the evening ritual, a time-honoured tradition where an icon of Shiva, one of the main deities of Hinduism, is taken to the chambers of Meenakshi, accompanied by joyful chanting and the ringing of bells, the sounding of horns, and the beating of drums – it’s a really intriguing spectacle, and one you certainly don’t forget in a hurry. Lakes of Kashmir In the 1800s the British were never allowed to own land in Kashmir, but there was a loophole, in the form of some beautiful lakes, their waters so still that the mountains shimmer on the mirrored surface – and here we were allowed to build houseboats. Today, you can still find some really marvellous houseboats made from deodar wood, with meticulously carved furniture that harks back to the golden age of the British Raj. Before the British arrived, it was the summer escape for the Mughal rulers of India; they didn’t build palaces but instead camped in sumptuous tents amidst Persian-style terraced gardens that featured fabulous cooling fountains, pools and channels – I love coming here to collect my thoughts. Aarti ceremony: a Hindu celebration taking place on the banks of the Ganges The Palace of Datia I first stumbled across Datia Palace in the Eighties whilst I was backpacking through India. Seven storeys high and a fabulous example of Indo-Islamic architecture, this 17th-century building was a great source of inspiration to the famous British architect Lutyens, who designed New Delhi. Featuring intricate murals and beautiful stone latticework throughout, it’s no wonder Lutyens described Datia Palace as “the most perfect palace in India”. Aarti Ceremony, Varanasi This Hindu celebration takes place every evening at sunset on the banks of the Ganges, the holiest river in India, in Varanasi, the holiest of all Indian cities. The religious dedication is quite something to behold. It’s simply mesmerising, an experience that totally overwhelms all your senses. I find that it’s moments like this where you’re really struck by how little of this culture you truly understand – and it fires your curiosity to learn much more about it.
