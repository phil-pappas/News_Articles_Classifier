Hedsor House is not only pleased to offer a Christmas Party dinner and dancing package for large groups, but with the addition of eleven new guest bedrooms this year it is thrilled to be launching its first ever ‘Great British Christmas’ festive experience. The two-night exclusive-use package will run from Christmas Eve through to Boxing Day and allows a group of family or friends to enjoy an unforgettable Christmas set in the stately home surrounds of Hedsor’s Georgian grandeur. \nMake Hedsor House A Home Following an extensive renovation and restoration project, Hedsor House unveiled its new guest rooms in June 2015. Now able to accommodate up to 22 people (sharing double rooms) the historic house will provide a spectacular setting for Christmas celebrations. Each of the heritage bedrooms will have its own mini Christmas tree and an individual box of designer decorations so that guests staying over can make the room their own. Deck the Halls Mulled wine and mince pies are served on arrival, and then guests will be invited to help decorate a huge tree that stands proudly in the domed Centre Hall. As per the estate’s tradition, this tree is felled from the grounds. Log fires will be lit, the halls decked with holly and mistletoe and the spirit of Christmas will be bought to life before merriments begin. The Night Before Christmas Hedsor tradition dictates that Christmas Eve must be celebrated in style. Social butterflies staying at the house can invite up to 140 guests for drinks and dinner should they wish to party the night away. Champagne cocktails and canapés will be served and a local choir will perform carols by candlelight. Night owls can attend Midnight Mass at the 11th century chapel just a few hundred metres from Hedsor’s grand front doors, easy walking distance from the house. Babysitters can be arranged on request, so high jinks can continue until the early hours… Christmas Day After a hearty breakfast of champagne and smoked salmon guests are invited to make like the Royal family with a gentle stroll across the grounds to the chapel for the Christmas Day service. They can return to the house for a champagne reception which heralds the start of Christmas lunch. Hedsor’s handpicked catering partners will create an extravagant banquet of traditional Christmas treats – the sky is the limit, except ‘Granny’s Geese’ who roam the grounds are strictly off the menu! Family and friends can work off the indulgence with a frosty stroll around 100 acres of private gardens before returning inside for a hot toddie. Children will delight in exploring Hedsor’s labyrinth of secret passageways and hidden doors whilst adults enjoy a fireside snooze. Winter Wonderland With exclusive access to Hedsor House’s historic parklands the possibilities for festive fun on Boxing Day are endless. If it’s a white Christmas then the Shephard Family (who own the house) will run their annual snowman building competition. The expert events team can arrange all manner of activities to entertain groups young and old. They can organise clay pigeon shooting on the lawns, design a Christmas quiz, lead a tobogganing tournament or even get Father Christmas to pay a visit himself. As an exclusive-use venue guests are guaranteed complete privacy and total freedom. Those booking the house for Christmas can tailor food, music activities and entertainment to suit their own needs. The new ‘Great British Christmas’ experience costs from £18,550 + VAT, booking the house from 24th – 26th December. This includes house hire and two nights of accommodation for up to 22 people (sharing double rooms). The Hedsor House Christmas Party package gives exclusive use of Hedsor House for one evening and is bookable for up to 140 guests. It includes a sparkling wine reception in the galleried Central Hall, a three course dinner in the ballroom with tea, coffee, half a bottle of wine per guest and dancing until midnight. It costs from £84 per head. Lunchtime Christmas packages for a minimum of 60 guests are also available and cost from £68 per head.
