As the world’s largest 777 operator, our multi-billion dollar commitment to the programme continues to support jobs and innovation across the aerospace manufacturing supply chain. The 777s give Emirates the range, reliability, and flexibility to efficiently serve close to 100 destinations on six continents with non-stop flights from our hub in Dubai. We are pleased to mark the delivery of our 150th 777 aircraft, and will continue to work closely with the Boeing team on the next generation 777X for the Emirates fleet.”\n“This triple delivery to Emirates is an outstanding moment in a partnership that has grown phenomenally over the last three decades,” said Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray Conner. “As Emirates takes delivery of its 150th 777, it underlines the remarkable track record of this aircraft, undiminished as the leading long-haul passenger and cargo carrier. We are proud of this relationship and the confidence that Emirates has shown in Boeing airplanes over the years.”\nEmirates ordered its first Boeing 777s in 1992 with delivery beginning in June 1996. The airline’s order book for the 777 continued to grow over the following years including a then record-breaking order for 50 777-300ERs at the 2011 Dubai Airshow and 150 777Xs at the 2013 edition.\nToday’s 777-300ER, which forms the largest part of the Emirates fleet, is the most fuel and cost-efficient airplane in its class and the most reliable twin-aisle aircraft in the world with an on-time departure rate of 99.5 percent. It also has the highest cargo capability of any passenger airplane. Emirates currently has 46 additional 777-300ERs on order with Boeing.\nWith today’s delivery, Emirates now has 13 777 Freighters, the world’s largest and longest range twin-engine freighter, capable of flying 4,900 nautical miles (9,070 kilometers) with a full payload at general cargo market densities. The airplane’s range capability translates into significant savings for cargo operators – fewer stops and associated landing fees, less congestion at transfer hubs, lower cargo handling costs and shorter cargo delivery times.\nBoeing also provides Emirates with essential support and services including parts and components and Airplane Health Management to speed the detection and resolution of maintenance issues, Jeppesen Crew Rostering services to optimize flight crew scheduling, and AerData STREAM (Secure Technical Records for Electronic Asset Management) to manage aircraft and engine records.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T11:12:47.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
