A report by the Royal Society of Edinburgh (RSE) warned the Scottish Government risks being branded \"anti-science\" by banning GM crops without any expert advice and warned the decision could inflict particular harm on the whisky industry. It attacked the Scottish Government for failing to consult Professor Louise Heathwaite, the lead scientific adviser to Mr Lochhead's rural affairs and environment department, prompting the Tories to accuse Nicola Sturgeon of running a government based on “polling and focus grouping”. The First Minister repeated that the decision was made to protect the reputation of the food and drink industry, rather than on scientific grounds. Her spokesman insisted that the decision was taken in the “national interest”. But the RSE called for a “rational debate” on GM in contrast to the “emotive language” used by Richard Lochhead, the Rural Affairs Minister who announced the ban. The announcement is \"likely to fuel negative public perceptions about GM and related technologies (and) assumes a degree of public hostility to GM that is not supported by recent public attitude surveys,\" the report said. It dismissed his claim the ban was needed to protect the environmentally-friendly reputation of Scottish produce, noting that the country’s agriculture sector has become reliant on imports of nitrogen fertiliser, phosphate and high-protein animal feed from South America that are “far from clean and green”. Nicola Sturgeon has admitted the ban was not made on scientific grounds Photo: PA The paper also noted that much of Scottish agriculture is geared towards production of goods for export, such as whisky, that has no impact on the nation’s food security. Maintaining crop production to underpin Scotland’s £14 billion food and drink industry will become “increasingly challenging” due to forthcoming legislation banning certain crop protection chemicals, it warned. The experts also predicted that climate change, and particularly extreme weather, will make it more difficult to produce the consistent quality of crop needed by the whisky industry among others. If Scottish farmers had access to blight-free GM potato crops, for example, the report said they could increase their yields while cutting their use of pesticides. This could mean cost savings passed onto shoppers. Produce from other countries that do grow GM crops will become cheaper and more reliable, the RSE said, making it harder for Scottish agriculture to compete in a global market place . They said Scottish ministers had failed to consult Prof Heathwaite “despite her evident expertise in this area” and said it was “unfortunate” the decision was taken while the Scottish Government post of Chief Scientific Adviser was vacant. It noted that the position had been left unfilled since the start of the year and there are many vacancies on the Scottish Science Advisory Council, warning this could create the perception of an “anti-science attitude”. The RSE warned the GM ban could damage the whisky industry Photo: Alamy Failure to adopt these technologies could damage the level of scientific research being conducted in Scotland and its universities’ ability to attract and retain pioneering researchers, it said. Professor Nigel Brown, a fellow of the RSE, said: \"Scotland is renowned for its world-class scientific research therefore it would be regrettable to stigmatise an area of exciting development which provides real scope for global benefit.” Ms Sturgeon told First Minister’s Questions she would consider the report but noted that many other countries, including Germany and Northern Ireland, had also banned GM crops. But Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, said: ““This is not just about GM crops – this is about her approach to government. It’s vote-chasing, political calculation – it’s not science, not industry and not jobs.” telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T20:40:55.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
