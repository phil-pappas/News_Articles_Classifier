Look on the bright side – no matter how far you’re going it’s unlikely to take anywhere near the 17 hours and 35 minutes it takes a Boeing 777 to complete the world’s longest non-stop scheduled flight, starting this February from Dubai to Panama City. But even half that time is likely to leave you feel tired and confined. So what gadgets and gizmos can you take to ease the journey? 1. Eviate eTrack Some things are “mission critical” to a business trip and you need to know exactly where they are. This small digital bag tag tells you where your luggage is at any time, alerts you when your case is on the baggage carousel (so nobody walks away with it by mistake) and even tells you if it has been opened during the journey. 2. Ostrich Pillow Make the mile-high doze a tad more comfortable with this enormous pillow. The added benefit is that it keeps the person sitting next to you from lolling their head onto your shoulder, or even coming near such a frightening object. 3. Flight Spray This cheap-and-cheerful nasal spray helps combat the dry cabin air and allegedly enhances your immune system to help protect against all those recycled germs transmitted in flight. Use wisely, as you only have 100ml to last the entire flight. 4. Headphones Yes, you do get complementary headphones on many flights, but if you can stretch to a pair of Shure or Beats, you can inspire serious in-cabin envy as you drift off or zone out to some crisp, clear tunes. 5. RFID-blocking jacket This sports jacket comes with an RFID-blocking lining to the inside chest pocket so your passport, ID and credit cards are all protected from cyber-thieves – handy, when you are travelling with many of your most valuable possessions in unfamiliar surroundings. 6. ReliefBand Voyager Motion Sickness Aid Get queasy when a bit of turbulence kicks in? This nerve-stimulation therapy provides user-controlled, electronically programmed pulses designed to reduce nausea and vomiting. • Find out more about how to receive business travel rewards by visiting British Airways On Business", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T17:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T12:40:41.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
