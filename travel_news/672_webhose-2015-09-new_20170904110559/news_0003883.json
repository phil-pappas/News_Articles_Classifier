Between May and September 2015, the four Bhaya Classic boats (I, II, III and IV) have undergone a major refurbishment in order to bring a more elegant feel and fresher appearance to Halong Bayâ€™s largest cruise operator. During the past five months, the interior design of all the cabins in each boat have been completely refreshed with new wooden floors, wooden panels, a whole new set of beddings and room decorations.\nThe brand new look was officially revealed in September 2015 in Halong Bay. The exquisite beauty of nature inspired the new classical and traditional decoration. The green and brown colours of the accommodation create a comfortable and harmonic atmosphere, coupled with new high quality beddings, in which passengers can look forward to a relaxing and enjoyable stay.\nBhaya Classic is also very proud of its high safety standards, which are regularly checked and serviced. Meticulous care is always taken to ensure the continued maximum safety for all guests and staffs.\nWith this major upgrade in 2015, Bhaya Classic continues to strengthen its role as the leading cruise operator in the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Halong Bay.\nReference Information\nBhaya Classic, the first luxury vessel designed for overnight cruising in Halong Bay, was launched in 2007. Today, Bhaya Classic has grown into the largest fleet in the area with a total of 7 boats and 93 luxurious cabins. The Bhaya Classic vessels are a flawless combination of traditional Vietnamese aesthetic delicacy and modern touch, providing guests with an unparalleled Halong Bay cruising experience with high-quality facilities, excellent service and world-class cuisine.\nIn May 2015, Bhaya Classic introduced a new Premium Balcony Cabin option in three new boats (V, VI and VII), giving passengers a more comfortable and private cruising experience in the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Halong Bay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T15:32:09.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
