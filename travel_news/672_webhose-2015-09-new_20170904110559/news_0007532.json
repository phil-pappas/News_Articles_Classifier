Handout photo / Tourisme Trois-Rivières A cruise ship visiting Trois-Rivières, Quebec. The steps leading up from the riverfront depict the highlights of Trois-Rivières' long history. Trois-Rivières is Canada's second oldest community. The city's old stone prison was Canada's oldest when the last inmate was booted out in 1986, 164 years after the first inmate was welcomed in. Share Adjust Comment Print Related Canada's once-forbidden Sable Island now exotic maritime adventure \nTROIS-RIVIÈRES, Quebec – It could be called the festival of silence. \nYou could hear a pin drop in this cruise port on the St. Lawrence River when Gaston Bellemare steps up to the microphone to introduce the next poet. \nEach poet gets three minutes to bare their heart and soul – or sense of humour. \nAfter all, some of the world’s most renowned poets are waiting for their turn to recite their moving words and moods. \nThe 31 st annual International Poetry Festival runs from Friday, October 2 until Sunday, October 11. \nMore than 100 invited poets from 30 nations on five continents will read and recite thousands of poems to nearly 50,000 poetry fans who flock to this port from across this continent and across the seas, drawn by their love of poetry. \nBellemare always suspected there was a stronger love of poetry out there than was being conveyed by the popular press. In the ’70s he persuaded his culture and recreation students at the University of Quebec in Trois-Rivières to express themselves in poetry and he awarded prizes to the best efforts. Word spread throughout Quebec about Bellemare’s poetry gatherings and within five years he had 5,000 fans turning up at his amateur poetry festival. \nSo he decided to go bigger and founded the International Poetry Festival. It has turned Trois-Rivières into the “Poetry Capital of Quebec.” This city of 133,000 souls midway between Montreal and Quebec City on the north shore of the St. Lawrence sees poetry year-round. There are 400 poems permanently posted in French and 21 other languages on the city’s downtown streets. Plus, there’s a special mail box where anyone can drop off their poetry creations for consideration by Bellemare and the selection committee. \nThe poems are delivered in dozens of languages and are translated immediately afterward into French and English. There is more than $50,000 in prize money, although Bellemare points out it is not a competition. \nTrois-Rivières is Canada’s second oldest community, founded in 1634, but it doesn’t have three rivers. \nSamuel de Champlain was a little confused by its geography when he sailed by in 1603. “Wow, look at that, three rivers,” Sam noted in his exploration diary. What he actually saw was two large islands at the mouth of the Saint Maurice River where it joins the St. Lawrence, creating three different water channels. It’s an easy mistake to make on a foggy day. \nLeft undeveloped by the locals, today those two islands are popular, heavily-wooded, waterfront parks. \nBellemare doesn’t get to introduce every poet. They perform at 70 different locations in the city’s restaurants, bars, libraries, churches, cafes, museums, city hall – and even in an ancient prison. \nThe city’s old stone prison was Canada’s oldest when the last inmate was booted out in 1986, 164 years after the first inmate was welcomed in. \nDespite the noisy venues, Bellemare is amazed and pleased with how quiet everyone becomes when a poet approaches the microphone. “The serving staff stop their work, conversations stop, no chairs move, no dishes rattle, sometimes even a noisy air conditioner gets shut down. People love their poetry,” said Bellemare. \nHe is now chairman of an umbrella group organizing and promoting poetry festivals in 21 cities around the world. \nSometimes a poet could be interrupted by the deep blast of a parting cruise vessel. Trois-Rivières has been promoting itself as an interesting destination for cruise ships plying the St. Lawrence. Although dozens sail by the city each year, eighteen vessels this season will pull up to the downtown cruise terminal. They may have been attracted by the huge $50-million amphitheatre that opened on the river bank this summer. \nIt seats 3,500 with another 5,500 standing or sitting on a grassy knoll. Cirque du Soleil presented a show unique to Trois-Rivières 20 times this past summer and committed to bringing new shows to the amphitheatre over the next two years. \nPoets invited to the festival have to be published and accomplished, and are usually sent by their home nation or city, such as Rachel Rose, Vancouver’s Poet Laureate . \nBellemare gets to review most of the invited poets, many of whom become close friends. One invited poet from Vietnam delivered his poems in flawless French and Bellemare was surprised to learn the poet was the right-hand man to the leader of Vietnam’s Communist government. \n“He told me he sent a poem at the end of the Vietnam War to General Westmoreland expressing his joy that the war was over,” said Bellemare. \nIF YOU GO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T01:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T12:01:29.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
