But some cars deserve more love than others. Over a lifetime spent writing about motors, the Telegraph’s Tim Gibson has been compiling a mental list of the best diesels ever. Here he finally gets the chance to share his top nine. The tenth is for you to decide… Peugeot 405 (1988–97) / Citroën BX Turbo Diesel (1982–94) These cars both made use of the legendary XUD turbo-diesel engine from PSA Peugeot-Citroën. That means they share great driving dynamics, frugality and longevity. Their French origins mean they are pleasingly stylish and slightly quirky. • Loved for their: Gallic charm and unusual looks Austin Montego Countryman 2.0 D (1984–95) The Montego may seem a surprising inclusion, but history will judge it to be a triumph of automotive design. In Countryman trim, it was comfy, well specced and elegantly styled. And the 2.0-litre Perkins-derived diesel lump is pretty much bombproof. Loved for its: status as a Great British classic Mercedes-Benz W124 E250 Diesel (1985–95) The W124 is one of the most reliable cars ever made, and a joy to live with. People pay thousands to have examples restored, and they will go on giving loyal, economical service for decades to come. A dream motor car. • Loved for its: utter reliability, no matter what you throw at it Land Rover Discovery 300 Tdi (1994–98) The first-generation Disco changed Land Rover’s fortunes, signalling an important phase in its transition from farmers’ favourite to luxury carmaker. Purists regard the 200 Tdi as the best version, but the 300-series is quieter, with a touch more refinement. • Loved for its: rugged image and everyday driveability Volvo V70 D5 (2000–07) The one thing missing from Volvo’s stable of high-quality family cars was a decent diesel-powered variant. Then along came the Mk 2 V70 D5, offering good value and an excellent drive. And suddenly it seemed as if the Swedes had the estate car sorted for another generation. • Loved for its: comfort, safety, space, frugality and brilliance Audi A4 1.9 TDI PD (2001–04) I could have chosen any VAG model that features this amazing engine. It was around for years in various Audis, VWs, Seats and Skodas, and is fantastically economical, reliable and speedy. Allied to the pin-sharp A4, it is close to motoring perfection. • Loved for its: unrivalled ability to balance performance with economy Volkswagen Touareg 5.0-litre V10 (2003–10) One of the finest performance diesel SUVs ever made. The V10 Touareg is a dream to drive, with epic amounts of torque, 308bhp and a top speed of 140mph. Examples change hands for surprisingly modest sums, putting this off-road hero well within reach. • Loved for its: epic torque and frisky acceleration Mini Cooper SD (2014 onwards) A diesel performance Mini: who would have thought? Well, BMW actually, and the Cooper SD more than lives up to its sporty billing. It offers assured handling, funky styling and is frugal with its fuel. For standout looks, the Clubman takes some beating. • Loved for its: cute personality and sparky turn of pace BMW 640d M Sport (2011 onwards) M Sport BMWs are renowned for breathtaking performance, and the 640d M is no exception. This car flies along with a rare grace, but the real surprise is fuel consumption that betters 50mpg. So that is sports-car pace and family-car economy… what’s not to like? • Loved for its: unrivalled mile-munching capabilities Complete the Hall of Fame What diesel currently on sale do you think belongs in this Hall of Fame?
