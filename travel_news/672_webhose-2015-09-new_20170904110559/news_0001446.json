It will indicate whether the foliage has begun to change colour, whether it’s in the midst of changing colour or will soon be peaking. \nShe stresses that the changing colours do not happen during Indian summer, a period of unseasonably warm dry weather which occurs after a frost or cold weather. \n“Contrary to what people believe, the tree colours are not caused by temperature but rather the diminution of light when days start to get shorter,” she said. \nLacombe recommends visitors set aside a weekend to give themselves extra time to take in various activities that also take place in the regions. \nIt may be too early to head for the slopes to ski, but many centres open on the weekends for visitors to use their ski lifts to go up the mountains to observe the fall colours. \nDanie Beliveau, who is with Tourism Eastern Townships, says four ski centres in her region put their lifts in operation, but it’s not free. \n“It could vary, but it’s around $10,” she said, adding that barbecues and wine tasting are also offered. \n“It varies from one ski centre to the other, but there are activities at all four: Mont Sutton , Ski Bromont , Mont Orford and Owl’s Head .” \nActivities are held in towns around the ski slopes: farms are open to the public and there’s also a tour of artists’ studios. \n“Not only will you visit the studios, you can drop in on a cheese factory or a vineyard,” she said, noting that there are 28 vineyards along the region’s so-called wine route. \nBeliveau says all the events are listed on Easterntownships.org and the website is bilingual. \nA search engine is available to help hikers who may want to tackle some of the region’s 140 trails. \n“If they want to climb a mountain, they put in the criteria and the search engine will provide the trails that satisfy their needs,” she said. \nThere’s a variety of options when it comes to lodging: small hotels with 40 rooms, large hotels with 100 rooms, campsites, small tree houses and outdoor teepees.“We even have a hobbit house — like ‘Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit,”‘ she added. The unique dwelling is located in the town of Eastman . \nIF YOU GO \n– Tourism Quebec: 1-877-266-5687.– Online: www.quebecoriginal.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T21:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T17:43:14.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
