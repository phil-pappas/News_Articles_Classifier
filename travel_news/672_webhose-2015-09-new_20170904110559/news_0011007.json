With an average of 15,000 people using the Silver Line daily for their commute, abundant parking was required. Local engineering firm, Timmons Group, provided full civil engineering, surveying, landscape architecture, planning, and permitting services on this Loudoun County priority project. The Silver Line Parking Structure will consist of three separate parking garages at two Silver Line Metro Stations in Loudoun County. The parking garages were designed to be placed strategically near Routes 772 and 606. All three structures will offer shelter for approximately 5,000 anticipated commuters’ vehicles. One parking garage will be located on the north side of the Route 606 Silver Line Station, the second is on the south side of the Route 772 Metro Station, and the final is on the north side of the Route 772 Metro Station.\n“The Silver Line is the most efficient public method of transportation that the DC Metro Area has seen in years. We designed these structures with citizen accessibility and safety in mind so that commuters can rest assured that their vehicles will be protected during their daily commutes,” comments Bill Vest, Senior Project Manager at Timmons Group.\nSpecifically for these structures, Timmons Group provided design for transportation access with circulation in and out of the garages, pedestrian circulation, utility design and extension, landscape plantings, and assisted in the architectural review board for Moorefield Station.\nAbout Timmons Group\nTimmons Group is a multi-disciplined engineering and technology firm recognized for over 25 years as one of Engineering News Record’s (ENR) Top 500 Design Firms in the country.
