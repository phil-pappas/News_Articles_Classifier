There is no communication, soldiers are present,” said Guyon from the train of 18 cars, which could be carrying a maximum of 750 people under Eurostar rules.\nWater and food have been distributed to passengers and “rescue services are also present for those who need help, particularly the elderly,” added the official, describing the situation as “complicated”.\nClothilde, 23-year-old French woman who lives in London, said she had seen the police hurrying down the train and believed there were migrants on the roof.\nA spokesman for French rail company SNCF said people on the tracks on the French side of the tunnel had forced a train to slow down.\nA Eurostar official said the company hoped to transport passengers to London, the train’s original destination, in the coming hours. Five other trains originally disrupted by the incident have either been sent back to where they departed from or on to their final destination.\n“We are doing everything possible to ensure passengers are welcomed with a drink, food, taxis and hotels when they arrive,” a Eurostar spokesman said.\nFrance and Britain have brought in emergency measures to deal with a surge in the number of migrants trying cross the Channel Tunnel after people died while making a desperate attempt to reach England.\nEurope is struggling to cope with a surge in new people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa, and Eurostar services have been repeatedly hit as thousands attempted to reach the “El Dorado” of Britain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T03:09:16.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
