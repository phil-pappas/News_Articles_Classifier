She studied engineering at Trinity Hall college, Cambridge . “I never intended to become a cyclist – it was genuinely an accident. I loved running as a teenager, and when I got to Cambridge one of the first things I did was join the running club. I ended up becoming a member of the Blues team, running for the university, but at the start of my second year I developed a stress fracture. The doctor told me I wasn’t allowed to run for six weeks. “I knew I wanted to keep doing sport, but I quickly got bored of swimming, and borrowed a road bike so I could do some cross-training. I ended up getting into triathlon, and then doing more and more time trials. “Cambridge University Cycling Club was a brilliant thing to be a part of. I was able to get experience of club rides and tag along to time trials, and the other riders were very encouraging. When I look back now, I can see how clueless I was – I’m so glad there were people around to help me out with kit. \"University is the perfect time to try a sport you’ve never done before. You often have access to great facilities, and the social aspect is really helpful.\" “Eventually, a friend persuaded me to enter a road race. I didn’t have any idea of tactics, but I did quite well for a total beginner. Then, in 2005, during the last week of my final term as an undergraduate, I got an entry for the National Road Race Championships. “I’d only just been given my racing licence, and I drove up the day before and slept in my car, but I came fourth. I was chuffed, and a few people whose opinions I respected were impressed too. “I didn’t realise how little I knew about the whole business – it took many years of racing, crashing and working for other riders on my team to learn how to race properly. It was a long and eventful journey. But it started in Cambridge. “University is the perfect time to try a sport you’ve never done before . You often have access to great facilities, and the social aspect is really helpful – it’s easier to take up a sport with encouragement and support from your peers , and more fun as well. “Later in life it’s harder to do something new – you have to make much more of an effort to find a club and get the advice you need as a newcomer.” Nicholas Oakwell , 46 One of the UK’s most successful couturiers. He studied fashion design and manufacture , specialising in millinery, at Epsom School of Art and Design (now Surrey Institute) “I’ve always been fascinated by couture – I remember going to the V&A when I was younger and gazing in total wonder at the beauty of all the pieces there. “But when I started looking at universities there just weren’t any specialist courses in couture that I could apply for. So I decided to study fashion design and manufacture, specialising in millinery. It was a way of working with my hands, which for me is what couture is all about – it’s the art of making beautiful clothes, rather than fashion per se. “We learned all the fundamentals at Epsom: design, presentation, cultural context and how to run a business. Sometimes, though, I felt like a fish out of water. There was a feeling that couture was a dying industry, with only a couple of thousand customers globally. “So I decided to start teaching myself the things I wanted to learn. I read all the books in the library on couture and found out as much as I could about how things were made – pattern-cutting was something I developed a real interest in. \"If you’re a student with an interest outside your course that you think might turn out to be important to you and you want to pursue it, do it.\" “But it wasn’t just me. I was lucky enough to be taught by the milliner Shirley Hex, who had also tutored people like Philip Treacy. She really set me on the path to where I am now: she’d worked at couture houses and knew everyone in that world. I remember her telling me about the great couturier Norman Hartnell and finding it extraordinary. “The accessory buyer from Harvey Nichols came to my degree show just before I graduated, and then a couple of days later she bought my entire millinery collection, which was fantastic. “But all the while I had a hunch that couture’s time would come again. If you went to any major city you’d find the same stores – the world had become one giant high street. In 1987, when Christian Lacroix launched his couture house, I felt like sticking my tongue out at everyone and going: ‘See, I was right!’ Twenty-four years later, in 2011, I launched my own atelier, Nicholas Oakwell Couture. “If you’re a student with an interest outside your course that you think might turn out to be important to you and you want to pursue it, do it – make the time. You’ll be spinning a lot of plates, but if you really love it, it’ll never feel like work. That’s how it was for me.\" nicholasoakwellcouture.com Katy Birchall, 27 Her first book, The It Girl, came out this year, and has been translated into 12 languages. She studied English literature and linguistics at Manchester University . “It was while I was watching an actor cry and flail their arms around wildly during a play about death that I decided to start writing comedy. I was an audience member at the University of Manchester Theatre Festival – and although everything I’d seen was good, it was all very serious. I wanted to see a play that would make me laugh, and on the off-chance there were other people like me out there, I thought I’d have a go at writing one myself. “I eventually came up with a script about a ninja monkey on drugs that’s let loose at a dinner party and tries to kill everyone. I was studying English literature and linguistics, but I had a friend doing theatre studies who asked me if she could read what I’d written. Eventually I gave in. “Not only did she like it, she gave me feedback as though it was actually important. I took what she said on board, and worked up the courage to send it in to the University of Manchester’s drama department. \"I was terrible at everything except English at school but I’d never seriously considered pursuing my love of it until Manchester gave me the courage to do just that.\" “Miraculously, they gave me the budget to put it on – and then gave me two awards for it after a sell-out run. The moment my name was called out as the winner for the Best New Writing award, everything changed. “I’d never really thought about writing as a career before. I was terrible at everything except English at school but I’d never seriously considered pursuing my love of it until Manchester gave me the courage to do just that. “If I hadn’t been given the chance to write that play I wouldn’t have heard the applause at the end of each performance and would never have believed I might be good enough to try my hand at comedy fiction. “Going to university and putting yourself out there is a scary prospect but, thanks to the hundreds of opportunities it offers and the variety of people you get to meet, it can also be a life-changing one. “Don’t be afraid to do something new just because no one else is: I wrote a play about a gibbon wielding a steak knife and now I’m an author. Work hard. Take risks. Stand out.” The It Girl by Katy Birchall (Egmont Publishing, £6.99) is out now @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T09:17:14.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
