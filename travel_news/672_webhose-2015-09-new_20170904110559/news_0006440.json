In the rolling hills of the Northeast Kingdom, we've discovered the small Vermont town that birthed what some are calling \"the world's best beer.\" And that's only the start of the pour.\nFollow this Traveler-approved brewery route—nine destinations along a four-and-a-half-hour drive, south to north—for a comprehensive tasting trip:\n© Courtesy Long Trail Long Trail One of the trailblazers of Vermont’s craft-brewing scene, Long Trail produced the first batch of their titular ale in 1989. Their brewery and pub (inspired by the Hofbräuhaus in Munich) is smack-dab in the middle of the Green Mountains, five miles east of Route 100. On your way out fill up a growler with their Double Bag (a strong altbier) or their Triple Bag (an even stronger amber ale).\nDrop-In The Drop-In Brewing Company is the brainchild of Steve Parkes, a master brewer who is described as the godfather of the Vermont craft-brew scene. He’s taught countless local brewers the intricacies of the sudsy science and offers instruction to the general public at the American Brewers Guild . Drop by the Middlebury, Vermont, brewery for a growler or two of Sunshine and Hoppiness or 6 Holes in My Freezer (a key lime pie–flavored brew—trust us, it's great).\n© Courtesy Lost Nation Brewing Otter Creek Brewing This Middlebury brewery has been a staple in Vermont (and throughout the Northeast) for more than 20 years, and has since expanded to include Shed Brewery, located in the same town. There are no tours of the brewery itself, but you can grab a seat at the on-site pub and restaurant, where dishes incorporate Otter Creek brews and local cheeses are on the menu.\nFiddlehead Brewing In a region known for excellent double IPAs—Alchemist's Heady Topper, Lawson's Finest Liquids' Sip of Sunshine—Fiddlehead Brewing is making a name for itself with its Second Fiddle, a bright, piney IPA that's inspired a similar level of fervor as those other beers. Stop by the brewery during its open hours to pick up a four-pack of Second Fiddle cans, or try what they've got on tap that day. Detour at Folino's, just next door, for a wood-fired pizza—since it's BYOB, you can sample what you snagged at the brewery.\nCheck Into: Hotel Vermont Serious beer lovers should book a room at this sleek boutique hotel near Lake Champlain: The property even has its own \"beer concierge.\" Matt Canning is on staff to help hops-heads with any number of brew-related activities, from finding a can of the elusive Heady Topper to recommending the beers to sample at the annual Vermont Brew Fest . Book a spot on one of Canning's beer tours, and you'll be treated to the best brews that the Burlington area has to offer. A tour may include a trip to the Hill Farmstead brewery in the Northeast Kingdom; sampling a gose (a German-style top-fermented brew) at Lost Nation in Morristown; and a stop at the Prohibition Pig, an excellent pub on the site of the old Alchemist brewery in Waterbury. Canning takes beer seriously, and after a day spent on one of his tours, you will too.\nQueen City Four old friends and longtime home brewers (including a toymaker and a chemistry and biology PhD) pooled their collective talents to open Queen City Brewery with a mission to adhere to traditional brewing styles and stay connected to the cultural heritage of their local community (Burlington, Vermont—otherwise known as “The Queen City”). Their brewery, which serves food on Fridays, is located on Pine Street—a stretch that’s burgeoning as a hub of creative and artistic activity in Vermont’s cultural capital.\nCitizen Cider If you've dismissed cider as overly sweet and cloying, then you need to give Burlington's Citizen Cider a try. The owners work with local orchards to source apples for brews like Unified Press, a dry cider that tastes like sparkling wine, or the Dirty Mayor, which gets a subtle spiciness from the addition of ginger. It's located on Pine Street, just down the block from Burlington beer heavy hitters like Zero Gravity and the Vermont Pub and Brewery.\n14th Star Named in honor of Vermont’s heritage as the 14th state to join the union (and therefore the 14th star on the American flag), 14th Star Brewing’s story is as interesting as their beer: Founder and head brewer, Steve Gagner, conceived the idea of starting a craft brewery as a captain in the army deployed in the mountains of Eastern Afghanistan. A portion of sales from 14th Star’s superb flagship beer, Valor Ale, goes to the Purple Hearts Reunited Foundation and they are intimately involved with local charities and nonprofits. Visit their brewery’s newly expanded location in the former St. Alban’s Bowling Alley to do good while drinking well.\n© Courtesy Otter Creek Brewing Lost Nation Located at the intersection of the Lamoille River and the famed Green Mountain beer trail, Route 100, Lost Nation excels in sourcing forgotten European beer recipes from yesteryear and faithfully reproducing them for their drinkers. One such example is their exceptional Gose; a light, German-style ale brewed with coriander and sea salt. Watch the sun set over Vermont’s tallest peak, Mount Mansfield, while enjoying a pint and some local grub at their tap room.\nHill Farmstead Located atop a hill in tiny Greensboro in Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom, Hill Farmstead turns out some of the world’s most coveted—and most-respected—beers. The tasting room is open Wednesday through Saturday, and it’s worth the inevitable wait to grab bottles or growlers of owner Shaun Hill’s well-balanced creations; if Susan, a delicate IPA, is on tap, pick up a growler to go.\nMore from Condé Nast Traveler:\nThe 2015 Friendliest and Unfriendliest Cities Around the World\n100 Top Hotels & Resorts in the World\n50 Things to Do in the U.S. Before You Die\n ", "external_links": ["http://lostnationbrewing.com/", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fAAdTJ2y%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fAAdTJ2x.img&description=Courtesy+Citizen+Cider", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fAAdTJ2y%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fAAdTdW3.img&description=Courtesy+Long+Trail", "http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2014-10-20/top-100-hotels-and-resorts-in-the-world-rca-2014?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fAAdTJ2y%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fAAdTtuj.img&description=Courtesy+Otter+Creek+Brewing", "http://www.abgbrew.com/", "http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2015-08-14/the-2015-friendliest-and-unfriendliest-cities-in-the-world?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://longtrail.com/", "http://www.vtbrewfest.com/", "http://www.queencitybrewery.com/", "http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2015-01-15/americas-best-beer-cities-as-chosen-by-beer-experts/4?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2015-07-29/how-small-vermont-town-birthed-the-worlds-best-beer?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2015-06-27/things-to-do-in-america-all-50-us-states?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://www.cntraveler.com/?mbid=synd_msn", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fAAdTJ2y%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fAAdTlIV.img&description=Courtesy+Lost+Nation+Brewing", "http://www.dropinbrewing.com/6-holes-in-my-freezer/", "http://www.dropinbrewing.com/", "http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2015-01-15/americas-best-beer-cities-as-chosen-by-beer-experts/5?mbid=synd_msntravel"], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T20:25:03.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
