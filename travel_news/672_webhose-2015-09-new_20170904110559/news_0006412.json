Furthermore, national parks provide a vital economic anchor for communities in every corner of the country. We got an unpleasant glimpse of what life would be like without our national parks two years ago, when they were closed by the federal government shutdown and the economy lost $152 million per day in spending by visitors. National parks are treasures that must be supported and sustained for all time, and the Centennial Challenge Fund would be an innovative pathway for achieving just that.\n“I applaud the leadership of Interior Secretary Sally Jewell for bringing forth this proposal, which will accelerate bipartisan congressional efforts to ensure the vitality of the parks for a second century.”\nSource:- Travel Association", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T11:18:32.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
