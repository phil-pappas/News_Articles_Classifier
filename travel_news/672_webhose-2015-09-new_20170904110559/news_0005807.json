Like the majority of the Costa Rican properties signing up directly with Oveedia, Playa Escondida will be exclusive to the Oveedia database and not available on any other OTA . Even those properties currently listing with Airbnb have committed to leaving the platform, expecting to list exclusively with Oveedia.\n\"Our growth is directly in-line with our initial projections and we're just getting started,\" stated Melvin Pereira , President and CEO of Pure Hospitality Solutions, Inc. \"Even now, 'pre-launch,' we have been getting quite a response from properties throughout Costa Rica , looking to become part of the Oveedia family. We expect this interest to continue and the number of exclusive listings to increase.\"\nThe Playa Escondida Lodge is known as a property where 'the jungle meets the ocean.' The smaller, but spacious lodge, rests on 2 acres of beachfront property. The owners of Playa Escondida endorsed Oveedia stating, \"I immediately saw the high potential of Oveedia as soon as I encountered it in the news. I have been listing with Airbnb since the beginning, and I foresee a similar, or even better success for Oveedia, in Costa Rica and Central America . This [Oveedia] is a real booster for the Central American tourism industry and I personally want to be part of the Company; not only as a client, but also as a shareholder!\"\nMr. Pereira concluded, \"We are truly humbled to receive an endorsement offering such positive words of encouragement. It certainly means a lot. Especially from people who know just how necessary it is to have an OTA that caters to the Central American-Caribbean hospitality markets.\"\nBeta Testing of the software is soon to begin. Management anticipates a successful launch.\nAbout Pure Hospitality Solutions, Inc.\nPURE provides proprietary technology, marketing solutions and branding services to hotel operators and condominium owners.
