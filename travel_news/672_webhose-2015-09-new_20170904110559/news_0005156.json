The girl drank the Nitro-Jagermeister shot in celebration of her 18th birthday and needed her stomach to be removed. The wine bar has been fined £100,000.\nThe girl upon drinking the potion which normally costs £3.95 said she felt an agonising pain and was forced to loosen her clothes as smoke bellowed from her mouth and nose.\nThe case was heard in Preston Crown Court. Gaby Scanlon, now 20, was left very close to dying after she experienced an explosion in her stomach seconds after she poured the drink. She had asked the barman if it was okay to drink, he had given his consent. Upon drinking smoke began to come out of her mouth and nose and she immediately knew that something was not right. Her stomach began to expand but the manager just waited for the drink to die down. Upon consuming the liquid nitrogen which is used for freezing warts, internal tissue was killed and the lining of her stomach was perforated. She still suffers from severe pain.\nShe was later taken to the Lancaster Royal Infirmary for surgery where her stomach and her small bowel connected with the oesophaguse had to be removed to save her life.\nThe Oscar’s Wine Bar and Bistro that had opened only five months prior this incident, pleaded guilty for failing in the duty to ensure the safety. It had permitted the consumption of a cocktail that was not at all safe and should have never been served to anyone. The bar had sold cocktails using liquid nitrogen in order to create a smoking effect. Similar drinks are also sold in the Berkeley Hotel in London. And the owner of the bar said that he found the effect intriguing and that is why he had used it.\nOn an earlier occasion before the incident took place a senior health and safety officer had raised questions on the use of liquid nitrogen, he had also sent a letter with guidance of the usage of liquid nitrogen but nothing happened.\nThe company has apologised to the victim and her family and the said that it was ignorant about the impact of the calamity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:17:27.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
