This Pousada is emblematic of what the Pestana Hotel Group excels at – taking historical properties and weaving their cultural heritage with modern luxury. The building itself, which sits on the edge of Praҁa do Comércio square, was once the powerhouse of the city. \nIt served as the Ministry of Internal Affairs and also housed the office of Salazar – the country’s infamous dictator. Its address on Praҁa do Comércio, places the Pousada’s guests steps from the River Tagus, and nearby to the oldest Café in Lisbon – A Brasileira – which was a firm favourite of the renowned writer, Fernando Pessoa. Working hand in glove with the Pestana Hotel Group, the Pousada’s architect Jaime Morais, has created a 90 room hotel with a luxurious boutique feel which benefits from 18th century high ceilings and original structural features. Rooms are bathed in an abundance of natural light, with views over the river and the iconic Sao Jorge castle. Bathrooms are slick, modern and complete with oversized rain showers and local Portuguese amenities by Castelbel. References to Lisbon’s rich historical past are littered throughout the property thanks to the original art pieces, on loan to the Pousada from the city’s museums. Surprisingly for such a centrally located property, the Pousada also offers an indoor swimming pool, spa and fitness centre. The Hotel’s signature restaurant Lisboeta is overseen by up and coming Portuguese Chef Tiago Bonito and offers a modern menu with a twist on the best of traditional Portuguese cuisine. Diners can enjoy the freshest fish from the Algarve accompanied by the very best port and wine of the Alentejo region. The restaurant is complemented by the Bar and Terrace which have already become a hangout of choice for locals in the know. Talking of this newest opening, José Castelão Costa, Chairman of the Pestana Pousadas Group said “The new Pousada de Lisboa will undoubtedly be one of the best hotels in the country and a reference in the city of Lisbon due to its location, restoration, and quality of service” Prices for Pousada de Lisboa (A proud member of Small Luxury Hotels of the World.) start from £150 per room per night based on two people sharing and include daily breakfast and wifi.
