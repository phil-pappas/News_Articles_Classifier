The ultimate way to explore Europe is on APT’s most popular river cruise, the 15-day Magnificent Europe itinerary Many of these activities are exclusive to APT and would not be possible to organise if you were travelling independently. But that’s not all. There are Freedom of Choice options available in many destinations, which allow guests to personalise their holiday by choosing from a range of amazing included options – all at no extra cost. The ultimate way to explore Europe is on APT’s most popular river cruise, the 15-day Magnificent Europe itinerary, which takes you from Amsterdam to Budapest – a 1,000-mile journey that crosses five countries. This Royal Collection river cruise offers not only luxurious accommodation and exquisite dining but also a selection of exclusive experiences. Picture perfect: tour beautiful Namedy Castle in Andermach One exceptional example is a private invitation to beautiful Namedy Castle in Andernach, the home of Princess Heide von Hohenzollern. The castle dates back to the 14th century and you’ll be captivated by a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the opulent life of European royalty when you wander around the ornate rooms and manicured gardens. You’ll be greeted with a champagne reception and, following your tour, will sit down for a banquet dinner and piano recital in the spectacular Hall of Mirrors. Another unforgettable APT exclusive is a journey between Passau and Linz in the exquisite carriages of the privately chartered Majestic Imperator. This extraordinary train has been painstakingly recreated according to the original 19th-century plans, so that guests can travel in private carriages resplendent with royal blue and gold furnishings, enjoy flowing drinks, white linen and beautiful paintings. You’ll pass through idyllic countryside on your way to a stop in spectacular Salzburg. Here, you’ll enjoy a guided tour that takes you to several sights from the much-loved film The Sound of Music. Back on board, you can sink into a cosy armchair and enjoy entertainment and the jovial atmosphere. Another highlight of your VIP experience with APT is an exclusive evening at the newly renovated City Palace, a magnificent aristocratic residence in the heart of Vienna. All aboard: enjoy a journey on the Majestic Imperator train A cocktail reception is followed by a private concert featuring classical masterpieces by Strauss, heavenly music sung by members of the Mozart Boys’ Choir and an opera recital. Other exciting highlights include a private tour and recital at the Hungarian State Opera House in Budapest; an experience of rural life on a wagon tour of a traditional Hungarian farm, including a horse show by Magyar cowboys and a goulash lunch accompanied by gypsy music; and a twilight cruise on the Danube to see the dazzling lights of Budapest. Apart from these fabulous opportunities, you’ll have all of your Freedom of Choice options along the way. In Cologne, for instance, you could take a guided tour of the Fragrance Museum or visit Bonn. While cruising along the most beautiful section of the Rhine, you can choose to take in views over the Rhine Valley as you travel in a gondola to the Niederwald Monument or a take a tour of Siegfried’s Mechanical Musical Instrument Museum in Rüdesheim. Opulent: enjoy an exclusive evening at Vienna's City Palace You might choose to marvel at the architectural beauty of Würzburg, journey along the Romantic Road to the medieval town of Rothenburg or visit the site of Hitler’s notorious rallies in Nuremberg.
