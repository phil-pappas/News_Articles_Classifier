Starting next week, Verizon Wireless customers who travel internationally can connect easily – including talk, messaging and data – while in the Caribbean’s largest nation, through the company’s Pay-As-You-Go International Travel option.\nVerizon is the first U.S.-based wireless company to offer roaming in Cuba.\n“Our customers are citizens of the world, and we want them to seamlessly enjoy a great Verizon experience wherever they travel,” said, Javier Farfan, vice president of cultural and segment marketing for Verizon. “By offering international services while traveling in Cuba, we are making it simple and easy for our customers to stay connected wherever and whenever they choose.”\nThe process is simple. Customers using a World Device who are traveling to Cuba can opt-in to add the Pay-As-You-Go International Travel option. While in Cuba, voice calls are $2.99 per minute, data is $2.05 per megabyte and standard international messaging rates apply. This allows customers the ability to stay connected while in Cuba.\nWith the addition of Cuba, Verizon offers international services in more than 225 countries worldwide.\nSource:-Verizon", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T06:36:35.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
