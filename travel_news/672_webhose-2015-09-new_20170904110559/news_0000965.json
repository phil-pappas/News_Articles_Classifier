The signature restaurant, Pasha Bar and Grill, offers north Indian-inspired dishes in a relaxed and modern setting, while guests can enjoy comforting and fresh, international dishes at Tiffin Room throughout the day. For a light bite and drinks, guests can get comfortable and settle in at Tiffin Bar.\nCommenting on opening of the hotel, Shantha de Silva, Head of South West Asia, IHG said: “Over the last decade, Bengaluru has emerged as a popular cosmopolitan city in India. The combination of business opportunities and the vibrant culture attracts both business and leisure travellers so we’re delighted to have converted this property to the Holiday Inn brand and bring it under our portfolio of hotels. It’s the perfect destination for us to expand our footprint in the southern Indian market.\n“The opening of this hotel is in line with our strategic expansion plans to grow the Holiday Inn and Holiday Inn Express hotels across India. These brands make up more than 85 per cent of our development pipeline in the country.”\nMr Gautam Nambisan, Chairman, UKN Properties commented: “Bangalore is one of the fastest growing cities in India, driven by the huge expansion of the technology industry here – and there’s room for even further growth in the coming years. It’s a pleasure to join the IHG family by converting this hotel to the Holiday Inn brand. We’re looking forward to a fruitful partnership.”\nHoliday Inn is one of the fastest growing hotel brands in the world, with 88 hotels and 20,300 rooms open across the Asia, Middle East and Africa (AMEA) region, and a further 52 properties in the company’s development pipeline in AMEA.
