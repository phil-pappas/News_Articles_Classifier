Usually I get you guys to help me count to three, but tonight I want you to help me count to two because I'm going to be in Vegas for two more years!\" \nSpears adds to Eonline.com , \"I'm not ready to leave Vegas yet! And I just really really love this show and this city... I'm so proud of the show, and my band, my dancers and my crew have all become such a family to me. When it came down to me really having to make this decision, I just couldn't imagine ending my residency at the end of this year. \n\"I definitely have some major changes planned. I'm getting together with my team this week to go over the set list, design some new costumes and dream up new props... There are a few songs that are fan favourites that I really want to add to the show. It's very exciting! If you haven't seen the current show yet, you should come out before the end of the year.\" Reader's comments Â» \nBy adding a comment on the site, you accept our terms and conditions .
