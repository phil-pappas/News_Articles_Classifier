PUBLISHED: 12:30, Thu, Sep 24, 2015 | UPDATED: 12:41, Thu, Sep 24, 2015 CEN Is this the scariest bridge in the world \nThe bridge, 300 metres long made has opened crossing Shiniuzhai National Geopark. \nTourists today visited the glass-bottomed bridge that sits 180 metres (590ft) above the ground in Pingjiang county. \nThe bridge, which according to some, sways in the wind when you cross it, spans a chasm at the national park. \nIt is proving particularly popular with brave tourists for its unique rock formations and geography. \nWalkers can see clear, stomach-churning views of the ground 180 metres below. REX Visitors were invited onto the bridge, which gives an unobstructed view of the terrifying 180-metre- \nPark management authorities added a small section of glass last year, but decided to transform the entire length of the crossing. \nThe floor is made of a double layer of glass and is just 24 mm thick. \nPeople using the creaking wooden structure in the past were told they needed nerves of steel and to be \"true men\" to brave the structure, and now tourism chiefs reckon that is even more the case with the glass bottom. \nEleven workers laboured 12 hours a day to convert the former wooden bridge into the new structure, reinforced with thick layers of glass and a metal frame.
