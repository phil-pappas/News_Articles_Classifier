So young, with such smiles full of hope for the future.\nTom Zbyszewski, 20. Andrew Zajac, 26. Richard Wheeler, 31.\n They were in a small fire engine overtaken by a blaze outside of Twisp on Aug. 19, after the vehicle plunged over an embankment.\nDaniel Lyon, 25, recently upgraded to serious condition at Harborview Medical Center, survived with burns over 60 percent of his body.\nRelated stories Cooler, wet weather gives crews helping hand in wildfire battle\nInjured firefighter improving at Harboview\nIt was partly cloudy and it had rained a bit earlier. Now there was sunshine. Not wildfire weather.\n“It’s very appropriate. It can rain all day, for all I care,” said Teresa Boushay, of Leavenworth, among the 300 or so lining the streets.\nShe had brought her daughter, Lila, along with her, and they had worn as much green as possible — pants, a jacket, a skirt — to try and look like the Forest Service people in attendance.\n“We just want to show our support any way we can,” said the mom. Lila nodded in agreement.\nTwo firetrucks were parked outside the center, their ladders crossed in salute to the fallen. A giant American flag fluttered from the makeshift arch.\nEntering the lobby, by the stack of programs, there was a basket full of tissue packages for the tears. A number of people picked them up.\nThe venue holds 4,500 and was about a third filled. Some of the civilians were dressed for the occasion, and some wore casual summer clothes. The firefighters were from numerous municipalities. They wore their dress formals, usually black suits, some with gold chevrons and braids.\nThen there were the younger firefighters, the ones who probably would be back on the line, in green slacks, khaki shirts and heavy work boots.\nA 40-member pipe and drum band, made of up of fire-service and law-enforcement personnel, marched in and filled the center with music. The members walked in a formal procession. It was sad and uplifting at the same time.\nDignitaries spoke.\n“Rick, Andrew, and Tom will always be in our thoughts and hearts, and will never be forgotten,” said Mike Williams, supervisor for the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.\nBut it was the words of friends and parents of the fallen firefighters that moved the mourners.\nSaid Mary Zajac about her son: “I’ve never looked closely at the effects of wildfires, but now I see that fires destroy thousands of acres and yet leave small spots the size of a home, or a power plant, or a town water supply completely untouched.”\nShe said, “It looks at first like it is some kind of divine intervention, but it is not. It is the product of human courage and sweat and now tears.\nWildfire coverage Watch how state’s largest wildfires spread 3 firefighters killed: ‘big heroes protecting small towns’ How to help with wildfire-relief efforts in Washington “I take comfort in knowing that our son was involved in such noble work, because you are miracle workers in this world.”\nShe read a message from Jennifer Zajac, the widow: “Andrew was my calm and my strength; my belay (climbing) partner, my fishing buddy, my hiking companion, my love. Just under a year ago we made a promise until death do us part. I just never imaged it would come so soon. I’ll miss him forever.”\nSaid Jennifer Zbyszewski about her son, Tom, who was well-known in the Methow Valley, having grown up there:\n“I’ve come to realize at the end of any given day, or at the end of a life, the only thing that matters is how many people you love and how many people love you. Both of these lists were long for Tom, built through 21 years of the deepest compassion I’ve ever seen or felt in anyone.”\nHis father, Ski Zbyskewski, was overcome with emotion when he spoke: “I will miss him so much,” he said, voice cracking.\nA ceremonial bell was rung, three rings, three times. It represents the end of an emergency and return to quarters, and is part of a firefighter’s funeral protocol.\nIt marked the end of the journey for the three firefighters.\nThe pipe and drum corps then played “Amazing Grace,” ending with one bagpiper playing the final notes by himself as he walked out of the center.\nAmong those who had come to pay respects was Bonnie Blankenship, a Wenatchee resident who has lived here most of her life.\nShe remembered the Wenatchee fires in late June at a subdivision not far from her home, and the work the firefighters did then.\n“It could have been my house,” Blankenship said. “I needed to be here today.”\nThen she began crying.\n“I’m sorry,” she said.\nAfter the memorial ended, among those in attendance had been a group of those young firefighters you see when the hills are ablaze, all fit, ready to fight.\nThey walked out in line to their vehicles. Two buddies looked at each other and sighed.\nErik Lacitis: 206-464-2237 or elacitis@seattletimes.com Twitter @ErikLacitis", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/ErikLacitis"], "published": "2015-08-31T03:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T05:20:28.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
