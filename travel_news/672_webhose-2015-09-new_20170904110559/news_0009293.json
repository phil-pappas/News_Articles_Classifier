Covered employees will see increased pay through an hourly skill differential, enhanced ability to retain employment, benefits and connection to railroad retirement and an ability to perform additional locomotive rebuild work in-house with CSX employees. This new agreement builds on the success of a similar work-sharing structure implemented at the company's Huntington Locomotive Shop in 2013.\n\"This new agreement is the result of tireless work between representatives from IAM, SMART and CSX, and demonstrates our collective commitment to finding innovative ways to support our employees while driving long-term efficiency,\" said Lisa Mancini , senior vice president and chief administrative officer. \"I applaud our union partners for working so closely with us through the lengthy discussions that began in 2013 at our Huntington Locomotive Shop.\"\nSMART General President Joseph Sellers, Jr. added, \"This agreement enhances job opportunities, job security and our members' ability to transfer across the system, while also improving training and supporting skill development. Across the board, we are taking an innovative look at building relationships that support our common interests now and into the future.\"\n\"This tentative agreement provides new options for CSX employees, giving them more control of their careers, by expanding on the efficiencies gained from our previous partnership at Huntington, West Virginia while providing CSX with the tools they need to have the most efficient locomotive maintenance team in the industry,\" said Jeff Doerr , IAM President and Directing General Chairman.\nAbout CSX\nCSX, based in Jacksonville, Florida , is a premier transportation company.
