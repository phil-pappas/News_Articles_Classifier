But Jared Benson , program manager for Guardian's Custom Glass Solutions (and a passionate racing enthusiast), didn't have any of this imagery in mind when he came up with an idea involving glass and racing.\n\"I was watching my friend, Sprint Car racer Greg Wilson , compete and I noticed all of the trucks used to transport the racecars were always visible in the pit area during the race,\" Jared explains. \"I knew we provide the windshields for most of those trucks and it occurred to me that there was an opportunity in those windshields.\"\nJared's idea was to embed LEDs into the windshield of the truck used to transport his friend's Sprint Car from race to race. The LEDs, which are completely sealed within the glass, could be used to display virtually anything, but Jared thought Greg would see value in using the display to promote his car and race team, Greg Wilson Racing. Jared worked with his Custom Glass Solutions (CGS) colleagues to understand the details and feasibility of such a project and then contacted Greg to discuss the idea.\n\"I was surprised when Jared first mentioned the concept,\" Greg says, \"as I had no idea LEDs could go inside the glass. I thought it was an interesting idea and told him to go ahead.\"\nWith support from Greg Brecht and Tim Frey at Guardian's Science and Technology Center in Carleton, Michigan , Jared and the CGS team at the Upper Sandusky, Ohio , glass fabrication facility got busy designing the LED circuits and preparing to manufacture the one-of-a-kind, value added windshield.\nAfter successfully fabricating the complex part, Jared and Tim supported the installation and wiring of the new windshield. The finished product works well and is drawing rave reviews.\n\"The windshield looks even better than I expected, a lot of people ask us about it,\" Greg says. \"It really stands out on the truck, especially during night races. We now have a very unique way to promote our brand at the races and on the road.\"\nAbout Custom Glass Solutions by Guardian\nGuardian's Custom Glass Solutions (CGS) is North America's leading producer of large format, laminated glass systems.
