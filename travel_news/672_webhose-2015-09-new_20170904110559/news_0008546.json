I know those specialized ropes are very expensive. Once they are secured at the top of a mountain and used to descend, how are they retrieved? If they're secured well enough to hold a person's weight, they couldn't just be yanked down. How does the climber get the rope back?\nI really don’t know much about mountain climbing, but then I really don’t know much about a lot of stuff so I might as well give this one a shot.\nApparently, it depends on what or where you’re climbing and how you are going about it.\nDid you know there are permanent — but scary looking — ladders in place on Mount Everest? One thing I read said they are only used during descents, but I don’t know for sure that is so.\nThese ladders are maintained by sherpas called ice-fall doctors. Better them than me.\nAt some sites, permanent bolts — anchors called belays — are set in the rock with hand drills. This apparently takes quite a bit of patience.\nAZCENTRAL\nWhy are horses in Westerns always galloping?\nClimbers can thread their ropes through these bolts and then shake them loose when they have finished the climb.\nSome climbers working in pairs use a complicated system of ropes, which frankly I don’t understand, and remove ropes as they go.\nAnd I suppose in some places there are ropes in place permanently, but I don’t know if I would trust something someone else had put in place and then left to the vagaries of nature. I don’t even like being the passenger in somebody else’s car.\nE-mail Clay at clay.thompson@arizonarepublic.com.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/78b47ee34da12a418ce39637de66b5ca4e102e62/c=0-251-2421-1619&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/08/31/Phoenix/B9318590040Z.1_20150831105247_000_G13BOF8MP.1-0.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-14T17:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T11:04:06.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
