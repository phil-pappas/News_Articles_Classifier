The announcement follows the endorsement of all three venues by the Association’s Executive Board during a meeting in Bangalore, India on September 6, 2015.\nThe PATA Adventure Travel and Responsible Tourism Conference & Mart 2017 will take place in Luoyang, Henan province, China. The city sits on the central plain of China and is regarded as one of the cradles of Chinese civilisation. Luoyang is one of the four great ancient capitals of China.\nThe name originates from the old town’s location on the north (or sunny) bank of the Luo river. The Longmen Grottoes south of Luoyang were added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 2000. Luoyang is famous for its water banquet comprising eight cold and 16 warm dishes – all cooked in various broths or juices.\nThe PATA Adventure Travel and Responsible Tourism Conference & Mart is a niche event that brings professionals involved in adventure travel and responsible tourism to discuss opportunities for pursuing and promoting environmental protection and social sustainability.\nThe PATA Annual Summit 2017 will take place in Negombo – a popular beach destination on the west coast of Sri Lanka. Tourism is a major contributor to local and regional incomes. Negombo is located about 20 miles north of Colombo, the island’s commercial capital, and only three miles from Bandaranaike International Airport.\nThe PATA Annual Summit comprises a one-day industry conference together with the Association’s Annual General Meeting, PATA Youth Symposium, PATA Market Place, PATA Chapter Colloquium, PATA Foundation Gala Dinner, committee meetings, workshops and complimentary tours.\nThe PATA Annual Summit 2018 takes place in Pyeongchang-gun county, Gangwon province in Korea (ROK). This region will also host the next Winter Olympics from February 9 -25, 2018. Pyeongchang-gun is located some 110 miles east of Seoul. It is a region popular with mountain hikers, skiers and snowboarders. The Alpensia ski resort attracts local and international visitors throughout the year.\nPATA CEO Mario Hardy is confident that these three events will attract a very broad cross section of PATA members, industry affiliates, notable guest speakers and enthusiastic delegates.\nSpeaking at the PATA Travel Mart 2015 in Bangalore he said, “The PATA events calendar has never looked more exciting and it has certainly never been busier. We are committed to encouraging the dispersal of tourists across a much broader spectrum of destinations and there is no doubt that our events programme gives a much needed boost to secondary and tertiary cities.”\nSource:-PATA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T12:57:00.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
