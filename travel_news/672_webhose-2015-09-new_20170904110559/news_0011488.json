Peter Bunting, Senator Mark Golding, Ras Iyah-V, Dr. Wykeham McNeill eTN   \nRastafari In Inity (RII) is proud to announce the historical partnership between Rastafari Rootzfest™ (RII) and High Times® to produce the first Ganja Festival in Negril, Jamaica, the “Capital of Casual” to be staged November 12-15, 2015. \nThe goal of this project is to produce a comprehensive, educational and well-organized Rastafari event that celebrates Rastafari ideology, livity and culture; tells the story of Rastafari struggle for the legalization of ganja; and celebrates the decriminalization of ganja in Jamaica. Rastafari Rootzfest™ is also conceptualized as an Annual Ganja Festival, Consumer Expo, Trade Show and Competition. \nThe amendments to Jamaica's Dangerous Drugs Act became law April 15, 2015. These amendments put in law Rastafari sacramental and religious rights as well as the staging of exempt event where ganja can be present. Thus, it has set the stage for the production of the first international wellness festival which celebrates Jamaica’s indigenous peoples and their cultural heritage, inclusive of educational seminars, commerce, art and music. \nDuring the Rastafari Rootzfest™, RII will host High Times® World Cannabis Cup®, which is an internationally renowned competition to select the best cannabis strains. It will be the first time that this competition is held in Jamaica. In partnering with High Times Magazine/Trans High Corp, RII aims to encourage innovation and the application of science and technology within the cannabis industry in Jamaica by and for the benefit of Rastafari and grassroots communities. \nRick Cusick, High Times Associate publisher, said, “We are very excited to finally get a good close look at the many varieties of Jamaican ganja from all over the island so we can pass the results along to our readers and to the world.” The High Times Jamaican Cannabis Cup competition will only be open to Jamaican ganja grown exclusively by Jamaican farmers. The unique judging panels will include traditional Rastafarian experts as well as professional High Times connoisseurs. \nPHOTO (L-R): National Security Minister, Hon.
