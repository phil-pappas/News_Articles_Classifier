The Hotels.com ® Hotel Price Index™ (HPI®) has revealed up-and-coming destinations to fuel traveler wanderlust for less. From food and wine, to music and arts, Hotels.com is bringing those lesser-known destinations to the forefront for your next adventure.\nUsing the average price paid* for a hotel night by Americans in the first half of 2015, the Hotels.com travel experts recommend these cities:\nFood\nLos Angeles ($175) and San Francisco ($217) are consistently mentioned as two of the best food cities in the U.S., but a number of more affordable cities have received national attention for being underrated foodie destinations.\nKansas City ($131) is renowned for its sweet and spicy BBQ style and restaurants serving some of the best BBQ in the country, but its up-and-coming restaurant scene offers innovative Latin American, Japanese and Southern food options. The city is also home to a number of craft breweries and new distilleries.\nOther Food Cities Under $135 : Sacramento, Calif. ($113) ; Houston ($129) ; Cleveland ($133)\nWine\nWhile Napa ($255) is the best-known wine destination in the country – offering a combination of top-notch wineries and critically acclaimed restaurants – there are many under-the-radar wine destinations to be found around the country.\nGrand Junction, Colo. ($88) offers the picturesque backdrop of the Grand Valley along the Colorado River for anyone visiting Colorado's Wine Country. In addition to the region's 20+ wineries, the city is also a gateway for hiking, mountain biking and rafting activities.\nOther Wine Cities Under $135 : Salem, Ore. ($101) ; Walla Walla, Wash. ($120) ; Petaluma, Calif. ($120)\nMusic\nNew Orleans ($191) is the birthplace of jazz and home to some of the most vibrant music clubs in the country, but these destinations also boast a unique combination of music and nightlife.\nAthens, GA ($111) may be best known for being one of the greatest college towns in the country, but it also packs a strong indie rock scene. With iconic venues like the 40 Watt Club and Georgia Theater and legendary bands that call the city home, Athens definitely holds its own.\nOther Music Cities Under $135 : Detroit ($121) ; Memphis, Tenn. ($123) ; Madison, Wisc . ($125)\nArts\nNew York ($245) is home to some of the best and most popular art and history museums in the world, but travelers looking to get their art fix on a budget can find it in these destinations.\nMilwaukee, WI ($124) is a city full of great museums like the Milwaukee Public Museum – home to the iconic Streets of Old Milwaukee exhibit, which features a three-quarter scale recreation of life in the city at the turn of the 20 th century. And the Milwaukee Art Museum is a work of art in itself, featuring a movable, wing-like brise soleil that opens up during the day and closes at night or during inclement weather.\nOther Arts Cities Under $135 : Tucson, Ariz. ($103) ; San Antonio ($131) ; Santa Fe, N.M. ($135)\nPlease visit www.hotel-price-index.com for more information about average hotel prices and the most popular destinations from the first half of 2015.
