And I’ve made quite a lot. SERVES 16 INGREDIENTS For the peanut butter caramel 160 ml (51⁄4 fl oz) coconut cream (the thick layer at the top of an unshaken tin of Thai coconut milk) 70 g (21⁄2 oz) caster (superfine) sugar 4 tablespoons peanut butter 4 tablespoons agave nectar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 3⁄4 teaspoon fine sea salt For the brownies 250 g (9 oz/12⁄3 cups) plain (all-purpose) flour 350 g (12 oz) golden caster (superfine) sugar 90 g (31⁄4 oz) cocoa powder 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon fine sea salt 250 ml (9 fl oz/1 cup) almond milk 2 flax eggs (see p 17) 250 ml (9 fl oz/1 cup) vegetable oil 1 teaspoon vanilla extract METHOD Heat the oven to 180°C (350°F/Gas 4). Line a 20 cm (8 inch) square baking tray with foil, letting it overhang the edges. To make the caramel, heat the cream in a small pan. Meanwhile, in a heavy pan off the heat, mix the sugar with 60 ml (2 fl oz/1⁄4 cup) water until dissolved, then cook over a medium–high heat until the mixture turns pale amber. Swirl the pan but don’t stir. Reduce the heat, add the warm cream, then whisk in the peanut butter, agave, vanilla and salt. Transfer to a bowl to cool and set aside. For the brownies, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder and salt. In a separate bowl, combine the remaining brownie ingredients. Gradually beat the wet ingredients into the dry until smooth. Pour half the batter into the prepared tin, then drizzle over half the caramel mixture. Pour over the remaining batter, smoothing it with the back of a spoon. Swirl over the remaining caramel. Bake for 35 minutes, or until firm to touch. Leave to stand in the tray for 10 minutes, then use the foil to lift out onto a chopping board. Cut into 16 squares. Serve warm or cold. Delicious with vanilla ice cream.
