A big city vacation in fall with the kids, in fact, gives you museums, festivals, hotels with indoor pools--and plenty of autumnal splendor. \nAutumn is often a blissful time to do a city getaway anyway: summer tourists are gone, prices have often dipped, and some of a city's best features--big parks, twinkling evening lights, and humming bakeries--come to life. \nHere are five cities where you can enjoy both pastoral majesty and metropolitan convenience: \nBoston \nFall folliage in Boston (Flickr: Chris Yiu) \nThe back-to-school energy in this big college town blends beautifully with the Massachusetts foliage--and the crowds of summer tourists are gone. The tree-lined Freedom Trail often gets dubbed the Foliage Trail this time of year, to accent the kid-friendly walk through Revolutionary history. For even more urban leaf-peeping, go to Harvard's Arnold Arboretum, in Jamaica Plain, which does guided walks on Saturdays. During October, kids will love walking through historic Beacon Hill as much as the grown-ups: the elegant neighborhood is famous for its fabulous Halloween decorations. If you come for later fall visit, you can start ice skating on Frog Pond in tree-filled Boston Common by mid-November. \nMinneapolis/St. Paul \nSaint Paul in the fall (Courtesy Visit Saint Paul) \nDuring autumn, the Twin Cities get their last hurrah before the long winter sets in: Minneapolis alone claims to have a park every six blocks, and the trails and lakes are lined with ash, elm and boxelder trees. For the best close-up views, pick up bicycles at rental shops like FreeWheel Bike or Wheel Fun and do a stretch of the almost 40 miles of the Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway, which includes the Minneapolis Chain of Lakes, Minnehaha River and Minnehaha Falls. The flour mill-based city also has a long tradition of excellent bakeries, which seem to beckon even more come fall: check out the Salty Tart, famous for its macaroons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T03:24:15.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
