The girls start mucking out at 7am, and then “I get down to the yard between 8 and 8.30,” he says. “Then I just keep riding until the riding is done.” As far as his career is concerned, the riding is far from 'done'. 35 years ago, Todd won his first Badminton Horse Trials on his horse Southern Comfort III. Coming into the final stage of the competition, the show jumping, in third place, he found himself a winner when Lucinda Prior-Palmer (now Lucinda Green) and Helen Butler, the two riders ahead of him, had fences down.

Since then, he’s been rather busy – mainly, being what some have called a “pioneer” for the sport, and in particular for riders from New Zealand, but also being knighted for services to equestrian sport, taking home another Olympic gold, three further wins at Badminton , and five at Burghley Horse Trials , where he is riding next weekend. “I’m going to Burghley again!” he says. It is, he says, his favourite event of all. “I’m hoping to go to the Olympics next year, and then I’ll just see whether I think that’s enough. I can’t keep going forever!” Sir Mark Todd Set in the Lincolnshire countryside, just outside Stamford, the house is set in Capability Brown-designed gardens in a grand park, with an exemplary cross-country course designed by former eventer Captain Mark Phillips . Visitors to the event – who needn’t be horsey, by the way – can walk the course on the Saturday, and watch as riders gallop through the mud and over the jumps. The estate makes for a splendid setting in which to ride, Todd says. “It’s like a fairy tale house, and the park around it is just beautiful.” The dressage at Burghley, in front of the House Photo: Eddie Mulholland The event itself is appealing, coming right at the end of the season. “It comes at the end of the year and everyone looks forward to it, they’re a little more relaxed. Of all the four star events [which also include Badminton in Gloucestershire, and Kentucky] it’s probably one of the most relaxed. It has a lovely atmosphere. Everyone seems to enjoy being at Burghley.” In the 36 years since his debut gallop around the course, it hasn’t changed much. “It’s become a lot more professional,” he says. “The whole event has grown.” Luckily, Burghley is as Burghley as ever. “It has retained its friendly atmosphere, and everyone ends up going to the George in Stamford at least one night of the week. It’s changed but not changed.” Mark Todd during the dressage stage at Burghley Horse Trials Photo: Trevor Robinson Despite his reams of success, this is Todd’s second wave of eventing. In 2000, he retired from international sport and moved back to New Zealand. “I had been doing it a long time that by stage, and I had won pretty much everything that I wanted to win,” he says. “I had lost the motivation to do it at the top level.” A few years of training and breeding race horses, he was dared to ride again. “I thought I’d get a horse to go to the 2008 Olympics in Beijing ,” he says, as if I’ve just suggested that he pops down to the shops for a pint of milk. He bought the 10 year old grey Gandalf, the horse he would take to Beijing, and found sponsorship from New Zealand Bloodstock. After Beijing, “I found that I was enjoying it again, and keen to go on,” he says.

He can’t name his favourite Olympics, on account of them all being special. But you always remember your first. “I ended up winning gold in Los Angeles. It was a novelty to go to an Olympic Games, and that is most athletes’ dream really, so to actually get to go there and to end up winning a gold medal was amazing. It was a really good games.” \"I just keep riding until the riding is done\" Sir Mark Todd “Seoul was good. They’ve all been different. Sydney was very good, and London was very good too.” The locations are just one part of the magic of eventing , too, he says. “Most of us [eventers] get on really well. At events, we live in our lorries, and it can be quite a social time, particularly if the weather is nice. It’s a bit like living in a small village; you can wander around the lorry park, and drop in, and have a drink, or have a meal with somebody.” Todd at Burghley in 1999 Photo: Martin Pope With a profession as nice as eventing, and with a yard of horses to ride every day – nowadays, he can ride up to eight horses – a second and final retirement might not seem an attractive prospect. “I’m hoping to go to the Olympics next year [in Rio], and then I’ll just see whether I think that’s enough,” he demurs. “I can’t keep going forever!” Sir Mark Todd is riding at Burghley Horse Trials from 3 – 6 September.
