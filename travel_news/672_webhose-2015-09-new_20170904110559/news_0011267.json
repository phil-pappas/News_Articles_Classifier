By airplane, of course. Flights depart daily and only take an hour! Get more info. Check out this article. \nWhen your in Vegas, you should consider taking a side trip to the Grand Canyon. The canyon is 270 miles from Vegas, but if you take a plane tour, you will get there quickly. Plus, when you go by plane, you won't waste time driving that you could spend exploring the canyon instead. Grand Canyon Plane Tours Operate DailyAir tours for the Grand Canyon leave at least three times a day. As you fly, you will see popular sites along the way, like the teal waters of Lake Mead. You'll also fly over the Hoover Dam, which is a massive structure that rises 725 feet above the Colorado River. Plus you will see some of the Grand Canyon before you land at Grand Canyon National Park Airport near the tiny town of Tusayan, Arizona. Be sure to snag a seat on the left side so you can get the best views. You have a variety of tour options available. One option you may want to add to an affordable basic tour is a 2.5 hour bus ride through the Grand Canyon National Park. This tour hits main spots but isn't as convenient as the Jeep tour. The Jeep tour lasts about 2 1/2 hours too and takes you on a 4x4 expedition. You'll actually see more on the Jeep tour and the experience is fun. When it comes to touring the South Rim by air, a good choice is the helicopter tour that takes you to the North Rim and back. This tour goes over the Dragoon Corridor, which is the widest and deepest part of the canyon. You'll have to pay a little more to fly by chopper and combine it with a land tour, but the expense is worth it. This tour offers spectacular aerial views of the Grand Canyon along with a ground tour where you can experience the canyon up close and personal. Sightseeing PlanesThere are two types of airplanes used on these Las Vegas tours. The Beechcraft 1900D or the de-Havilland Twin Otter plane will probably be used on your tour. There are both good for sightseeing, so pick the one that suits you. The wings on the de-Havilland Twin Otter planes are on top so they won't block your view, and the windows are large and idea for sightseeing. The cabin is roomy but not every seat is a window seat since there are two seat rows on one side and one seat rows on the other. This aircraft has commentary available in 10 different languages that include French, Japanese, Chinese and German. The Beechcraft resembles a jet with its long body and wings located at the middle of the plane. The cabin is comfortable and each seat is a window seat for better viewing. Beechcraft airplane tours are more expensive, but everyone will get a great view. All fees associated with the tour is included in the price. There will be no additional charge for entry passes, taxes, surcharges, or miscellaneous fees because they are all included in the price of your tour. Round trip transport to Vegas hotels is part of packages as well as expertly trained pilots who double as your guide and host. You'll get everything you need in one package for one price. Nature's Beauty AwaitsIf you want to see the Grand Canyon and truly appreciate it, you should take an air tour. Grand Canyon air tours provide not only comfort and efficiency; they save you time and give you more landmarks in one trip. Compare an 11-hour bus or car ride to make the round trip from Vegas to Tusayan compared to a quick one hour flight, and you'll see why a plane tour is the best choice. Air tours are very popular, so they sell out quickly, therefore, book your tour early and do it online so you can get an Internet discount.   from ArticlesFactory.com ABOUT THE AUTHOR \nThe writer is an expert on Grand Canyon sightseeing trips and suggests going here to get the Vegas-South Rim airplane express at the lowest price possible: http://lasvegasgrandcanyonairplane.com/coupons.html", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T05:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T10:19:31.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
