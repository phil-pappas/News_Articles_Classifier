Oxford residents are well aware of it so presumably the con man seeks pastures new. Variant of the dangerous scam in the Champs Elysees where the Korean scammer offers you a \"500 euro\" note to buy a €420 LV bag for him and his missus & keep the change, \"because the shop has a one bag rule and we want two\" Anyone encountered that one? You'd do time for forged currency in France, so beware! This scam has been operating around Oxford, particularly on the A34 at Botley, for months.
