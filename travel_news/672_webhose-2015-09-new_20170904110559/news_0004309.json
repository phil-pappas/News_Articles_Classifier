According to a poll of 600 workers carried out by the BBC, 54 per cent regularly work through lunch breaks. Eating lunch as you work means you never escape the day’s stresses. And since stress leads to increased cortisol, which in turn can lead to fat accumulation, you're not doing your waistline any favours either. Taking a proper lunch break – actually stepping away from your desk and outside – is common sense. Taking a proper lunch break is just common sense There are obvious health benefits to getting out into the fresh air, not least the revitalising effects of sunshine, which stimulates vitamin D and the \"happy\" hormone, serotonin. Going one step further, and getting active during lunch, is also beneficial. A study conducted by the University of Birmingham, published in the Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports in January 2015, concluded that a lunchtime walk helps employees feel less tense and better able to cope with the afternoon's challenges. So as well as gaining in fitness, the workers involved were more productive. Britain’s healthiest company winner Sanofi Pasteur MSD goes out of its way to encourage lunch-break activities. At its head office a recent initiative, Midday Mile Walks, had take-up from around one-third of employees. There are now plans to introduce a lunchtime yoga class. So the message is clear. Get away from your desk, take a walk if you can but, at the very least, find a spot outdoors to enjoy your lunch. Your brain and body will thank you.
