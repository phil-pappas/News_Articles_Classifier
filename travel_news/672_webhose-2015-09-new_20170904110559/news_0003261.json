Additionally, this year will see the entrance of new tour operators from markets such as Poland, Switzerland, Spain, Columbia, Peru, Mexico and Argentina to name a few. \n“JAPEX continues to play a key role in keeping Jamaica top of mind among the travel trade. It allows us to strengthen our position in an extremely competitive marketplace. The opportunity to focus on attention of the travel trade exclusively on Jamaica for several days cannot be over stated,” said Paul Pennicook, Jamaica’s Director of Tourism. Madden-Greig also announced that as a new component to JAPEX this year, the JHTA will also host another Speed Networking Event where JHTA members will be able to connect and establish links and contract with over one hundred (100) local suppliers of products and services used by the tourist industry. \nCarolyn McDonald-Riley, Head – Tourism Linkages Hub stated that “in continuing the mandate of the Tourism Linkages Hub, partnering with the JHTA at JAPEX will assist in ensuring that the sectors are linked through continuous additional business.” She added that “our participation at the 2015 JAPEX is another step in the right direction for the tourism sector and Jamaica’s economy as a whole.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T23:15:34.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
