The bargain ticket comes in as part of a brand new range of advanced purchase ticket fares, which Heathrow Express are trialing and which represent enormous savings for families, holidaymakers and business travellers alike. In addition, the , and the fares can now be booked a full 24 weeks in advance, double the current booking period. \nThe new ticket pricing structure starts with a 25% saving off the Express Saver and Business First fares for tickets booked up to seven days in advance and then steps up to 50 per cent % off for bookings made up to 30 days in advance and 66 per cent % for tickets booked for between 90 days and six months before travel. Heathrow Express is the fastest route from central London to Britain’s busiest hub airport with its non-stop service between Paddington station and Heathrow taking 15 minutes, every 15 minutes. Fraser Brown, Director of Heathrow Express said: “These new fares prove that travelling to and from Britain’s hub airport by Heathrow Express is the smarter way to travel. Many travellers flying in and out of Heathrow have booked flights well in advance, so it makes sense to book your airport transfer at the same time as your flights for the maximum saving.” Advance tickets are valid only on the date shown on the ticket and are non-refundable and availability is limited at certain times.
