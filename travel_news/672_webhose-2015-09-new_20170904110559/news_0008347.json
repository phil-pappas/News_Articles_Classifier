He explains: “I may be biased, but I think Croatia is one of the most beautiful countries in the world! “The scenery is outstanding, with mountains that stretch down to the coast, and the pristine Adriatic Sea that is a shade of deep blue you just never forget.” He explains: “There’s history all around you too, with wonderfully preserved buildings to admire, such as the Roman-era Diocletian’s Palace in Split and Porec’s Euphrasian Basilica which dates from Byzantium times – the country really is like an open-air museum.” I’m always trying to exceed our customers’ expectations, and surprise them Saga has offered holidays to this amazing country since the 1970s, so it has a long-standing relationship with many of the hotels. The local staff that Saga carefully selects also deliver exceptional customer service, making a holiday to Croatia unforgettable. “As well as sourcing a variety of great-value hotel stays along the Dalmatian coast, I am particularly proud of introducing all-inclusive small-ship cruises to Saga customers and the UK market,” says Denis. “I’m always trying to exceed our customers’ expectations, and surprise them. “As a keen sailor I know the best way to explore the ‘land of a thousand islands’ and enjoy the fantastic Mediterranean climate is by sea, so I carefully chose ships that would meet our high standards and that were small enough to hug the coastline and visit the hidden little bays. “The ships are exclusive to Saga guests, so there’s a great atmosphere on board – it feels like you are on your own personal yacht!” For the latest travel news, sign up to the fortnightly Saga Navigator newsletter , or follow @SagaHolidaysUK", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T01:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T20:55:49.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
