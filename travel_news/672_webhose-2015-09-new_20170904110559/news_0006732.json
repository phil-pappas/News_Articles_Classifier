This new infographic from FastFoodMenuPrice may have you rethinking that craving.\nBig Mac infographic What happens 1 hour after eating a Big Mac? Picture: Fast Food Menu Price Source: Supplied\nWhat happens 1 hour after eating a Big Mac does exactly what is says. In 10 minute intervals, consumers are given an insight in to what the burger does to their body — and you might be surprised to what effect the Big Mac has on your ‘temple.’\nTen minutes after caving in to your burger craving, you feel good, right? That’s because the ‘feel-good’ chemicals in your brain — such as the neurotransmitter dopamine are released.\n“It is true that when we eat highly palatable foods, especially those high in fat, sugar and/or salt, it triggers the reward centre of the brain to encourage us to eat that food again. This was useful when food was less plentiful and less energy dense, but today makes it more likely we will overeat,” Dr Joanna Mcmillan said.\nDig in.

Although containing less sodium than the US version, our Big Mac contains more than 850mg of salt. The infographic alleges that dehydration might trick you in to thinking you’re still hungry — cue the fries and sundae, anyone?\n“The daily recommendation (of salt) is less than 2300mg. It is correct that a high sodium intake can indeed raise blood pressure and increase the risk of stroke and heart disease, but I don’t agree that post a meal this will necessarily increase your hunger. You will certainly challenge your kidneys to have to excrete the excess sodium and you will probably feel thirsty as your body tries to replenish the fluid,” Dr Joanna said.\nAn hour has passed and digestion has well and truly kicked in — but give your body time, because this bad boy will take a good deal of time to digest. Carrying 27 grams of fat and even more in carbs, the tasty Big Mac likes to linger.\nSo — in comparison to other lunch options, is the 2000kj bun worth the mouth-watering moment?\n“Let’s not beat about the bush — it’s not a healthy lunch option! There are very few vegies and so very few protective antioxidants, about half of the energy comes from fat and about 20% of the energy comes from saturated fat, it has almost no fibre and the carbohydrate is all high GI. It won’t take 3 days to digest, but given that it is not actually a big volume of food you may well find yourself adding fries and whatever else to the meal, pushing up the kilojoules even more!”\nBurgers 22:25 Play video\nMillions of burgers are eaten globally each week. But meat laced with hormones could be taking its toll on us.\nOovvuu 16 Mar 2015 TV/Series TV/Food TV/Documentary What a Big Mac does to your body", "external_links": ["https://fastfoodmenuprice.com/big-mac-revealed/", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/09/24/1227542/004948-6d53d5d4-625f-11e5-a366-6ffd7a84795b.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/09/24/1227542/007266-208fce8a-6262-11e5-a366-6ffd7a84795b.jpg", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://videomam.news.com.au.s3.amazonaws.com/generated/prod/05/06/2015/37546/image1024x768.jpg?count=1&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/food/beware-the-big-mac-infographic-shows-what-happens-an-hour-after-eating-the-burger/story-fneuz8zj-1227542007295", "https://drjoanna.com.au/"], "published": "2015-09-25T13:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T23:29:10.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
