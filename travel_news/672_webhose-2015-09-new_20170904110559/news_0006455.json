Hua Hin itself — a small, low‑rise town with sprawling food markets, dozens of hotels and with a markedly more local feel than Phuket, attracts Bangkok dwellers in droves for weekend stays.\nAs voluminous pillows of cloud skate across the cerulean sky, market traders selling coconut milk, herbal remedies and skewers of barbecued pork gaze out to the sea, whose choppy, frothing waters slurp against the vanilla-coloured sands.\nThis is a town that few foreign visitors bother with, preferring to push on, straight to Phuket.\nBut they’re missing out. Fishing boats still bob lazily in the harbour and the night market comes alive after 8pm, with local couples feasting on freshly-made ice-cream and bartering over everything from spray-painted T-shirts to hand-stitched handbags and retro lamps.\nCreature comforts: An in-room hot tub inside the tranquil Amari hotel provides a perfect retreat\nThe Amari hotel exudes tranquillity from the moment you step into the rich, blue-walled lobby, complete with a lounge full of leather chess sets and rattan chairs.\nThe hotel’s seafront restaurant serves mountainous plates of fresh lobster, clams and crab, and there’s an outstanding spa where I had seashells placed against my ears so I could hear the sound of the ocean during my massage.\nThe hotel can also arrange trips to the Hua Hin Hills Vineyard, just 18 miles away, where some surprisingly fine local wines are being produced — its Chenin Blanc and Colombard Monsoon Valley varietal recently won a gold standard award from Decanter magazine.\nAnd there is another royal element. Maruekatayawan is a palace built by King Rama VI in the Twenties, which directly overlooks the beach.\nNow vacated and open to visitors, its long, teak-floored galleries are a cross between a seaside pier and an M. C. Escher picture, stretching seemingly endlessly across the beach front.\nKing Bhumibol whose reign began in 1946 (left) and palm trees line a relaxing beach at Hua Hin (right)\nSurrounded by coconut groves and mangroves, it was here that the unfortunate king, who named his home ‘Far From Worries’, was staying when a coup against his absolute monarchy was launched in 1932.\nAfter registering my commiserations, I headed to Khao Takiab, a wooded outcrop jutting out into the sea like a clenched fist just on the edge of Hua Hin.\nHome to hundreds of macaques, the indolent beasts sprawl, sleep, bicker and play at the foot of a flight of steps so steep as to look like they come straight from an Inca fortress.\nA sweaty climb to the top brought me to a Buddhist temple where, brandishing a bunch of daffodils bought from a vendor outside, I entered the small prayer room, dominated by an altar upon which perched a small model of a rather skinny-looking Buddha.\nFollowing the example of locals, I placed myself on my knees, pushed my head and hands to the floor three times and inhaled the pungent smell of the burning joss sticks.\nI felt suitably becalmed. And why not?\nThe king still sits on his throne in the palace nearby, the fresh lobster still crawls into the fisherman’s nets and the sun continues to beat down on this royal, and utterly beguiling corner of Thailand.\nTRAVEL FACTS: Plan your own Thailand retreat Double rooms at the Amari Watergate Bangkok from £64 B&B and at the Amari Hua Hin from £51 (0066 3261 6600).\nEmirates (0344 800 2777) offers economy return fares from London to Bangkok from £492.\nBusiness-class returns, including chauffeur pick-up and drop-offs, start from £1,899 if booked by September 21.\nRead more: Amari Hotels & Resorts - Colours and Rhythms of Modern Asia Book Flights | Find Hotels and Car Rental | Emirates.com", "external_links": ["http://emirates.com/", "http://amari.com/", "http://dailym.ai/1Uyx0IY"], "published": "2015-09-05T18:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T19:33:16.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
