Easyjet is also due to switch from the South Terminal to the North Terminal in November 2016.\nA BA spokesperson said: \"Our customers are invited to use Gatwick's No.1 lounge from January 2016 when the current British Airways lounge will be closed for building work.\"\nEarlier this month, it emerged that No.1 Traveller will double its capacity in both Gatwick terminals over the next year.\nba.com", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BBT_online"], "published": "2015-09-23T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T12:03:50.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
