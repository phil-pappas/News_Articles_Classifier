You’ll find in on T-shirts, postcards and the lips of natives and tourists alike. “Pura Vida” translates to “pure life,” which leaves lots of room for interpretation. “Pure” references the environment – Costa Rica was early to embrace ecotourism, and has pledged to make the country carbon neutral by 2021. “Pura Vida” also says something about the slow pace of life here, the sunny friendliness of the people, the beauty of the land. Costa Rica straddles the Central American isthmus, giving it coasts on both the Caribbean and the Pacific. In between are steep mountains, deep jungles and farms that produce coffee, bananas and palm oil. San Jose, the capital, sits in the Central Plateau. It’s heavy with traffic and light on charm, and all many travelers see of San Jose are airport hotels. But we wanted to get a taste of Central America, so we spent our first night at an inexpensive place downtown. We stayed at the Hotel Gran Costa Rica, which dates to the 1930s and still has the feel of an earlier age, when coffee barons ruled this place. The Hotel Gran sits across a small stone plaza from the Teatro Nacional, one of the capital’s more beautiful buildings, and we strolled the city’s streets and public gardens. Costa Rica is about the size of West Virginia, and it’s tempting to try to see the whole place on your first visit. There’s the Caribbean coast, a place of dense mangrove forests and an island culture. The Arenal region to the north is known for its volcanos, the mountains to the south for their deep wilderness. With less than a week, we chose to pick one scenic spot and stay there: the area around Quepos, where the rain forest meets the Pacific. So on our first full day, we headed west from the Central Plateau, down rolling hills to the sea. As we headed south down the coastal highway, we looked up to see a pair of scarlet macaws flying alongside us above the trees. They always fly in pairs, our guide told us, and this is the only place you can find them living in the wild in large numbers. Pura Vida. We came to Costa Rica to connect with the natural world. Central America, where the North and South American biospheres overlap, is one of the most diverse habitats on earth, and we wanted to see it all. So we took the top floor of a house in the rain forest (a great deal through Airbnb, a two-bedroom apartment listed for just $49/night) where we could sit on our porch in the canopy and watch the wildlife go by: A bright yellow toucan perched in a treetop, deep azure butterflies and, one morning, a large family of spider monkeys working their way through the trees. Page 2 of 3 - Our place was in a private preserve with miles of deserted trails to explore. Nearby is Parque Nacional Manuel Antonio, Costa Rica’s most popular national park. There, well-maintained trails lead to pristine beaches. Silent sloths hide in the treetops and the screams of howler monkeys rip the air. Long-legged raccoons and giant iguanas make the beach their home. Snakes, lizards and exotic bugs abound, but mosquitoes were rare, at least in April. We stayed long enough to settle into a nice routine. We explored the jungle floor in the mornings, got out of the tropical sun in the middle of the day, and headed for the beach in the afternoon. We tried several restaurants for dinner and, every day, managed to watch the sun make a spectacular descent into the Pacific. We’d sip our Imperials – Costa Rica’s signature beer – and toast to Pura Vida. For the adventurous, there are plenty of opportunities: Kayak tours through mangrove swamps, ziplining through the jungle, canopy walks over suspension bridges. Manuel Antonio is a popular stop for the global backpacking set, and offers hiking at all levels of strenuousness. Prefer the water over the trails? There’s plenty of beach and boating activity as well. Costa Rica has all-inclusive resorts for those who prefer to eat, drink and beach without leaving their comfort zones. We prefer to explore on our own and soak up the local flavor, which we found pretty easy to do. Warned that the streets were narrow, the cliffs steep and the drivers crazy, we chose not to rent a car. Our house was off a main road several miles outside of Quepos, but we were easily able to use a system of informal taxis: Get out to the main road and raise your hand and, within minutes, a car will pull over and give you a lift to Quepos for about a dollar. Quepos is an unassuming town of modest homes and shops along dusty streets. Costa Ricans – called Ticos by visitors and natives alike – outnumber the tourists there, but Quepos also has a lively ex-patriate community that gathers at Dos Locos, a Mexican café across from the bus station. While many Ticos speak English, many don’t, so be prepared for some awkward sign-language conversations – part of the fun and challenge of travel in a foreign land. From Quepos, buses leave frequently for Manuel Antonio, a more tourist-oriented village at the entrance to the Parque Nacionale. The bus is just 60 cents, but the national park is a bit expensive, at $30 for entry. There are pristine beaches both within the park and outside the gate, and they are the main draw. Manuel Antonio has lodging that ranges from backpacker hostels to luxury hotels, along with a wide variety of restaurants and clubs. It’s also considered the most gay-friendly destination in Costa Rica. Page 3 of 3 - Costa Rica is more affluent than many Latin American countries, blessed with a stable, democratic government - it disbanded its army decades ago – and vision of sustainable development. You won’t be bothered by children begging for money, and you’ll rarely see litter along the roadside. What you will find are friendly people, a laid-back atmosphere, natural wonders and, of course, Pura Vida. Rick Holmes writes for GateHouse Media and the MetroWest Daily News.
