Business events with at least 50 delegates staying a minimum of two consecutive nights can apply for complementary reserved seats at either the Seoul Mega Concert , a K-Pop musical performance at Seoul Plaza scheduled for early October, or at the Seoul International Fireworks Festival on October 3. Seats for either event will be reserved on a first-come, first-serve basis. \n\nThe second programme comes with a longer timeline and is aimed at business events that are slated to take place between now and June 2016. Groups that qualify for this programme will receive a 10,000 won (US$8.40) food credit per delegate, a city tour of Seoul on coach, and up to 3,000,000 won in credit towards a Seoul-based performance. \n\nApplication for either programme must be made by September 30 this year through mice@seoulwelcome.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T09:49:45.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
