LOUIS , Sept. 24, Trans States Airlines is pleased to announce that its pilot group has passed a Tentative Agreement on a three year contract extension. The Trans States Airlines pilots are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA). The Tentative Agreement, which was unanimously recommended by the ALPA Master Executive Council (MEC) for a rank and file vote, passed with 71% of voting pilots voting in favor of the contract extension. The new contract increases first year pay to $35.81 per flight hour, and includes increases in cost-of-living pay and the pilots' per diem rate. It also increases the company's 401(K) contributions and decreases pilots' health insurance costs.\n\"We are extremely pleased with the ratification of the three year extension to our pilot contract,\" said Rick Leach , Chief Executive Officer of Trans States Airlines. \"This new agreement, which includes the highest first year pilot pay in the regional airline industry, solidifies our position as one of the premier regional airlines in the country, and shows that this is a great place for pilots to fly. The fact that this agreement was concluded three weeks from the first amendable date underscores the positive and mutually respectful relationship that exists between the company and ALPA.\"\n\"The majority of our pilots realize that this extension, which provides immediate gains in quality of life and pay, is significantly more beneficial than engaging the company in traditional contract negotiations,\" said Captain Zach Barnes , chairman of the Trans States Airlines MEC.\nThe new contract will go into effect on October 1 , 2015.\nAbout Trans States Airlines\nTrans States Airlines operates a fleet of Embraer 145 aircraft on behalf of United Airlines (as United Express) and American Airlines (as American Eagle).
