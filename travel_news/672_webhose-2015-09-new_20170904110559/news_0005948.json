It brings cooler temperatures and some of the nation's best fall festivals . Locals and visitors alike celebrate the break from the heat and humidity of Florida summers by taking to the streets to commemorate harvests, enjoy arts and crafts shows, sip wine, taste a variety of cuisines, listen to music, and celebrate Halloween . Also, beginning in October, carnies begin migrating south to escape the harsh northern winters, bringing fairs and carnivals to the state. \nThere is something going on in every part of the state, every weekend from early September until Thanksgiving, so pack up the family and enjoy the sights, sounds, and great Florida fall weather! You won't want to miss these highlighted events: Disney's Night of Joy in early September brings popular award-winning Christian performers to the stage at the Magic Kingdom, with a chance to take a ride on your favorite attractions. Buy your tickets early — the after-park-hours two-night event is often a sell-out.\nGet your thrills watching Christian artists perform and riding your favorite attractions at Universal's Rock the Universe in early September (the same weekend as Night of Joy). The two-night event requires special tickets which should be purchased in advance (the event is usually sold out).\nIf it is officially Autumn, as if on cue, cooler weather will arrive. Taking a break from the heat and humidity of Florida summers, Floridians celebrate by taking to the streets in many varied fall festivals . Epcot's International Food & Wine Festival runs six weeks — from early October through mid-November. The event is marked by wine tastings, Disney and guest chefs cooking up culinary delights, and the popular Eat to the Beat! concerts. Entrance to the Festival, plus select wine and beer seminars, cooking demonstrations, culinary exhibits, concerts and all attractions are included with regular Epcot admission. Specialty events require reservations and separate event admission. \nFlorida becomes a scary place in the fall. Communities, organizations and attractions become favorite haunts for those seeking fright-filled nights — from the horrifying Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Orlando and Busch Gardens Tampa Bay's Howl-O-Scream to the tame Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party at Disney's Magic Kingdom and \"Zoo-Boo\" celebrations at local zoos. \nIf you're looking for a more traditional fall activity, get lost in a corn maze! Look for these to crop up in early October in Central and North Florida. Scott's Maze Adventures at Long & Scott Farms in Mount Dora features a different themed maze each year. Spend the day sliding down their 60 ft. slide, fishing in the pond, taking a hayride, having a picnic or simply enjoying the country atmosphere. Conner's A-Maize-Ing Acres is located in Hilliard and features special old-fashioned country-themed fun and games. Roger's Farm in Gainesville offers unique fun-filled activities and rides — hayrides, mini-mazes, cow train, corn cannon, pumpkin launcher, pony rides and more. Sweet Season Farm located in Milton has fun lined up this season with a new maze design and unique activities, including a corn box, hayride, tube slide, corn cannon and cow train. \nFor more specific information on weather, best times and events:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T03:24:46.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
