What are you saying to me?\"\nThe response is a high-pitched shriek from the interloper, who goes by the name of \"Boo.\"\nBoo is a capuchin monkey.\n\"This little guy is my best friend,\" Newton says of the 4-year-old monkey. \"It's good here, isn't it? It's good to be home, right?\"\nIt is good to be home. In June 2013, this moment seemed impossible. Buzz Aldrin seemed more likely to return to the surface of the moon than Wayne Newton to return to Casa de Shenandoah.\nThe ranch estate, glorious for its grassy expanses, artesian wells and lines of stables that housed dozens of Arabian horses, had served as a source of familial distress, lawsuits and unrealized dreams.\n\"Nobody thought we'd be back here,\" Newton says, shaking his head. \"When we moved out, I never thought I'd be back here, either.\"\nHe reflects on the day he learned he would be leaving Shenandoah and the day he said goodbye to the ranch. Was he sad? Were there tears?\nNo.\n\"By the time we got to the point of leaving, I had had enough of the toll it was taking on my family,\" Newton says. \"We had been fighting in court for a long time. I got tired of hearing my daughter (Lauren, now 13) come home from school and repeat some of the things she had heard from her classmates. It just wasn't worth it anymore.\"\nBut make no mistake: Wayne Newton is a tough dude. He is one of the great survivors.\n\"I will never back down from a fight,\" he says. \"I've been through it with NBC (Newton filed a libel suit against the network in 1981 over a series of reports claiming he was tied to organized crime), and I've been through it with Johnny Carson (when Newton flew to Burbank, California, and reportedly told the talk-show host, \"I'll knock you on your ass,\" if he didn't stop a litany of jokes he had been making at Newton's expense). But when we left Shenandoah, I was just relieved.\"\n___\nSigns that the Newtons — Wayne and his wife of 21 years, Kathleen — had regained a genuine interest in what for years has been called \"the Ranch\" surfaced in December. That's when the \"Casa de Shenandoah\" sign was returned to the corner of Sunset and Pecos roads, replacing the staid \"Springs Ranch\" sign and signaling that Newton was making a comeback to his former home.\nThat return now is complete. On Sept. 18, Shenandoah opened to the public with tours, a newly constructed museum housing memorabilia dating to Newton's childhood and a stunning array of animals, including Newton's Arabian horses and peacocks, wallabies, and of course, little Boo.\n\"Shenandoah is a magical place; I really believe that,\" Newton says. \"You ask, what got me through the difficult times in my life? The animals. The horses. Being with them has calmed me, and they belong here. This is something I needed to do, come back here and return what means so much to me to this property.\"\nThe move back to Shenandoah has been physically and mentally taxing. In early summer 2013, the Newtons vacated the home Wayne had lived in since 1968 (he bought the original five acres two years earlier) and relocated to a home on East Oquendo Road, the result of a settlement with former business partners Lacy and Dorothy Harber . But Newton's return to Shenandoah is foremost a business agreement. The Harbers maintain majority ownership of the property through CSD LLC, formed six years ago to purchase Casa de Shenandoah and turn it into a museum dedicated to Newton.\nThe family now is performing many of the operating tasks itself, from designing attractions to displaying memorabilia in glass cases to producing the video tour narrated by Newton himself.\nIf you think your most recent move was difficult, consider that Newton owns a huge collection of stage costumes, a dozen exotic and antique vehicles, a bevy of personally-signed letters from every president dating to Kennedy, and a Fokker jet.\n\"The other day we had to put wrought-iron ramps up around the living room of the main mansion to be in line with ADA regulations, because there was nothing there for when you bring the public into that space,\" Newton says. \"So here I am, paying attention to the wrought-iron in the living room of my old home. ... It has been a challenge, to say the least.\"\n___\nThe history of the museum dates to early 2010. The Newtons had befriended the Harbers, well-financed real estate investors in Grayson County, Texas. Lacy Harber, the billionaire owner of American Bank of Texas , longed to help Newton create a museum at Casa de Shenandoah.\nThe group created CSD LLC, with the Harbers owning 70 percent of the corporation, the Newtons owning 20 percent and property manager Steve Kennedy and his then common-law wife, Geneva Clark , splitting 10 percent.\nBut the deal came unraveled in spring 2012, when Kennedy sued the Newtons after the project stalled. Newton fired back with a countersuit, alleging it was Kennedy's own inaction and unauthorized conduct that blunted the attraction's progress. The project — although not Newton — fell into bankruptcy in October 2012, and Shenandoah twice was listed for sale: first for $70 million in September 2013, then for $30 million last September.\nBy then, the Newtons had been living at the Oquendo Road estate they bought from Las Vegas producer Norbert Aleman , founder of \"Crazy Girls,\" for $5 million. The property includes a second home across the street and enough acreage to house Newton's Arabian horses.\nShortly after a public tour of Shenandoah last September, Kathleen Newton received a call from Lacy Harber. (Wayne famously refuses to carry a cell phone.) It was a rare overture. Wayne Newton said the voice on the other end was friendly and to the point: \"Wayne, you built Casa de Shenandoah, it is your home, it will always be your home. Let's work something out so you can take it back.\"\n\"I said, 'Absolutely,'\" Newton recalled. \"I talked to my wife, and between the two of us, we decided to take one more shot at building something special.\"\nIt is doubtful that Harber, given his affection for Newton (business squabbles aside), would want to be responsible for selling Casa de Shenandoah to a developer who would wipe out the ranch and build a housing subdivision. That's what was being discussed when Harber phoned Newton with the idea of the Newtons taking back the property.\n\"This really is a piece of Las Vegas history,\" Newton said. \"It would be a shame for it to be turned into something else.\"\nAs a signal of friendship, the Harbers attended an invite-only opening of Shenandoah.\n___\nNewton has been amassing personal items for about 60 years, particularly since he began performing at the Fremont Hotel's Carnival Lounges as part of the Newton Brothers with brother Jerry. He has a massive collection of memorabilia.\nBut the viability of his museum, in today's Las Vegas, is hardly a certainty. A similar attraction dedicated to Liberace closed in November 2010, in large part because Liberace's name recognition had waned.\nEven Elvis isn't a sure thing in Las Vegas. Cirque du Soleil's \"Viva Elvis\" closed and there has been a lackluster response to \"The Elvis Experience\" stage show at the Westgate, though Graceland Presents Elvis: The Exhibition, a museum and tour, still is flourishing.\n\"I realize there is that issue; I'd be naive to think otherwise,\" Newton says of needing to keep his name in front of a new generation of fans. \"It happens to all of us, but the difference between Casa de Shenandoah and Graceland, for that comparison, is that I am still here. I can boost interest personally if need be.\"\nAnd Shenandoah itself is a unique destination.\n\"The property itself is so special, sitting on artesian wells here in the middle of the desert,\" Newton says. \"I think people will realize that when they see it.\"\nNewton is not finished as a performer, either, though he hasn't played in Las Vegas since closing his Tropicana stage show \"Once Before I Go .\" in April 2010. His only recent show in Clark County was Dec. 6 at Laughlin's Edgewater hotel-casino. He still performs one-offs around the country, however, and spends ample time in his Montana home.\nBut Mr. Las Vegas still very much remains Mr. Las Vegas.\n\"I have every hope I will perform again in Las Vegas,\" Newton says. \"I am still singing, and this is my home.\"\nNewton shares the reason for his ambitious designs at Shenandoah: \"I think it's a great way to say thank you to this great city. I owed it to the city that has been so great to me.\"\n___\nInformation from: Las Vegas Sun, http://www.lasvegassun.com", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T19:38:36.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
