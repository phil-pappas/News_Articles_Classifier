Located in Imerovigli Village—Santorini’s highest settlement—the resort opened last year after being constructed from the existing hand-hewn hollows of the steep slope-face, which originally housed private residences and shops in the caldera community. Both of the new suites were converted from two of the hotel’s previous accommodations and feature a large living room and bedroom, two bathrooms, and a terrace that looks out upon the Aegean Sea. \nAmidst the archipelago’s ubiquitous blue-and-white exteriors, guests are ensconced in traditional Greek-inspired interiors that are both elegant and grounding. Elements of the natural environment—such as four-layer beds padded with pure wool and with headboards made from the branches of indigenous trees—are seamlessly integrated with modern amenities, including large flat-screen televisions, dedicated Wi-Fi, and air-conditioning. \nThe new Cycladic additions complement the existing Caldera, Grotto, and Cliff Suites (all of which have their own built-in hot tubs), along with the Iconic Suite—the hotel’s most spacious and luxurious lodging with both indoor and outdoor pools. In October, the Iconic Santorini will be offering Romance packages (with a three-night-minimum stay) for the Grotto and Cliff accommodations that include a daily breakfast, a complimentary bottle of Champagne and homemade chocolates, a 1-hour couples massage at the spa, and dinner for two. Pricing for the packages is available upon request and based   while the Cycladic Suites start at $565.
