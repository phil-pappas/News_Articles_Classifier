When it comes to taking a sick day, Australians also like to plan ahead, with the average Aussie worker taking three days to plan their pretend illnesses.\nIn response to this, Aussie comedian Dan Ilic has created a video guide to help people call in sick so they can hit the slopes over a long weekend.\nDan Ilic comments; “The team at Destination Queenstown felt they might get in trouble if they were to teach the entire Australian workforce how to skip work and escape to the snow. Something about economic collapse, trade sanctions and potential invasion… blah blah blah. As a comedian, they thought I might get away with it. So I made a video to show fellow Aussies how to take a sick day or two off work to get their perfectly healthy arse to Queenstown.”\nGraham Budd, CEO at Destination Queenstown, comments; “While we were shocked to hear about the number of Australians that fake sick days, we can fully understand why people would go to great lengths to stow away to Queenstown, because it’s the best place on earth. Admittedly we’re slightly biased”.\nAnd while Queenstown is three hours away from East Coast Australia it’s on the door step for Kiwis who might also be contemplating a spring visit to New Zealand’s favourite holiday destination. With great conditions right now, spring skiing is at its best.\nAfter a bumper winter season and some early September snow the Queenstown ski fields are gearing up for one of the best spring seasons on record.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T20:23:31.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
