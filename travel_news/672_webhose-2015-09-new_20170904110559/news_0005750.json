China, 21 September 2015 -- From the advent of electric scooter onwards, the sector of intelligent self-balancing scooter has experienced three phases. It was the first time that the intelligent self-balancing scooter presented itself with a single-wheeled scooter to the public. The model was famous for its agility and appealed to those who were highly skilled in wheelie and willing to challenge. The single-wheeled scooter dominated the then market for scooter for a while. After soon, the twin-wheeled scooter appeared in the market. The twin-wheeled scooter arrived mainly for making up for the inconvenience caused by the single-wheeled scooter. The single-wheeled scooter is quite hard to steer. The modification to the scooter implied the shift in function of scooter. These days, the two-wheeled scooter predominates in the market. This type of scooter has an excellent ability to keep balance. The two-wheeled structure further ensure a strong grip. Of those two-wheeled scooters, FOSJOAS V9 and U3 are the best ones. They become more functional than recreational.In some works, it is easy to seen FOSJOAS V9 or U3 applied.
