After a BSc and PhD in geology at the University of Manchester she worked for two years for the British Geological Survey before joining BP in 1982, where she has held many technical and senior management positions in the UK and abroad. I became a geologist by accident. I originally applied to study chemistry at university but we had to take a subsidiary subject and I chose geology. One field trip and I was hooked on this subject that explains how the Earth actually works. There’s a frontier spirit about the oil and gas industry which is very exciting. You’re exploring new territories, finding out what’s underground and travelling the world. In the Seventies the North Sea was opening up, oil and gas discoveries were coming on stream, and I really wanted to be part of it, but it was very hard for a female geologist to break in. I knew I had to differentiate myself, so I did a PhD in micropalaeontology – studying the tiny fossils used to date and categorise rock types and build up a picture of the subsurface. It was a very specialised and sought-after skill-set, and it was my entry ticket to the industry. You really stood out as a woman in those days, especially offshore. On my first trip I had to sleep in the medical centre because there was no female accommodation. But people were very welcoming and soon we just worked together as a team. I’ve lived in several countries and worked in most parts of the world, including the USA, Canada, West Africa, the Middle East and China. I spent four years as business development manager for Angola, working with scientists, engineers and commercial teams to win exploration and production licences in Angola’s frontier deep-water blocks. We made some great discoveries. Science and engineering skills are very transportable across industries, so if you have a flexible mindset and you’re prepared to learn you have a lot of career options. In 2000 I became BP’s technology vice president for fuels and lubricants. Suddenly I was working with the automotive industry. It was a steep learning curve but I learned a huge amount, not just about automotive but about manufacturing, supply chains, marketing and customer relations. Part of my job as chief scientist is about understanding emerging technologies and assessing their impact. BP spends around £450 million a year on research and development, much of it in partnership with universities. We established Manchester University’s International Centre for Advanced Materials (ICAM), where we’re investing in developing new materials such as self-protecting and self-healing materials and coatings. Some could eventually be applied not only in BP’s businesses, such as self-healing pipelines, but in everyday life. Imagine if your car’s paintwork could heal itself following a bump in the car park. Try to make yourself stand out if you want to join this industry. Do as many internships as you can, visit facilities, come to one of BP’s Discovery Days, make an effort to find out about the sector so that you can talk knowledgeably and passionately at interview. And if you really want to do it, don’t let anyone discourage you. STEM Awards 2016 Change your future.
