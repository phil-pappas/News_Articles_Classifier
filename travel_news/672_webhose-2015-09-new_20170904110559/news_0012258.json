The contract allows for up to 800 heavy duty buses from all different propulsion types that included 12 different categories for all-electric buses. The contract has the potential to be the most complete electric vehicle procurement in US history as it includes buses from 30 – 60 feet in length for both highway and transit applications, as well as long-range and shorter range, on-route charging configurations. BYD Motors being the only electric bus maker globally that manufactures 7 different all-electric buses, capable of long range as well as in-route charging configurations was awarded wins in 10 of the 12 available vehicle categories and has the ability to deliver any of their buses within six months. BYD is also the only bus manufacturer on the contract with wireless on route charging as an option approved by WSDOT. The mass procurement by WSDOT is being seen as a visionary move by Washington State , clearly establishing itself as one of the most environmentally conscious states nation wide. Any transit agency or public institution in Washington , as well as the state of Oregon , is now able to procure electric buses from the RFP, greatly simplifying the procurement process, and cleaning the air faster.\nWith the most comprehensive line up of electric buses BYD Coach & Bus , a division of Southern California electric vehicle manufacturer BYD Motors, Inc. finished the RFP process as the winner in 10 of 12 vehicle categories. BYD Coach & Bus Vice President of Sales Macy Neshati commented, \"It is a tremendous honor to be have received such a vote of confidence from the Washington State DOT.\" Said Neshati , \" WSDOT continues to show leadership in the transportation electrification movement and they stand out nationally for taking such a firm stance on air quality improvement. As a Nation, we are on the eve of greatness as we prepare to show the world the path to energy independence and this procurement will be seen as a key moment in the electrification of the U.S. transit industry; electric buses are no longer a science-fair project, with BYD now producing a long-range bus in nearly every category we have proven the technology is here to stay.\"\nCATEGORY\nSELECTED MAKE & MODEL\n30' LOW-FLOOR TRANSIT, LONG-RANGE\nBYD Coach & Bus – BYD K7\n30' LOW-FLOOR TRANSIT, ON-ROUTE CHARGING\nBYD Coach & Bus – BYD with WAVE wireless charging\n35' LOW-FLOOR TRANSIT, LONG-RANGE\nBYD Coach & Bus – BYD K9S\n35' LOW-FLOOR TRANSIT, ON-ROUTE CHARGING\nBYD Coach & Bus – BYD K9S with WAVE wireless charging\n40' LOW-FLOOR TRANSIT, LONG-RANGE\nBYD Coach & Bus – BYD K9\n40' LOW-FLOOR TRANSIT, ON-ROUTE CHARGING\nBYD Coach & Bus – BYD K9 with WAVE wireless charging\n60' LOW-FLOOR TRANSIT, LONG-RANGE\nBYD Coach & Bus – BYD K11\n60' LOW-FLOOR TRANSIT, ON-ROUTE CHARGING\nBYD Coach & Bus – BYD K11 with WAVE wireless charging\n45' OVER-THE-ROAD COACH, LONG-RANGE\nBYD Coach & Bus – BYD C10\n45' OVER-THE-ROAD COACH, ON-ROUTE CHARGING\nBYD Coach & Bus – BYD C10 with WAVE wireless charging\nPictured Above: The 10 Categories of the WSDOT RFP BYD Motors won.\n\"Any of Washington State or Oregon's transit authorities, agencies, universities, or institutions are now able to procure electric buses from the approved list of makes and models without going through the cumbersome and time consuming RFP process. All that work has been done by WSDOT,\" stated WSDOT David Chenaur, Capital Programs Manager.\n\" Washington State has long been a leader in the clean-energy movement, and WSDOT is proud to be doing our part in furthering this mission on the transportation side of the equation. Our staff has spent the past few years researching every electric bus on the market, and after rigorous evaluations of each manufacturer and their products we believe we have given our transit authorities the very best electric buses in each vehicle category to build their fleet with.\"\nBYD's Battery Electric bus employs many advanced technologies developed in-house by a staff of more than 15,000 R&D engineers including the BYD Iron-Phosphate battery which boasts the only 12-year-battery warranty in the industry. Combined with BYD's proprietary in-wheel hub motors and regenerative braking system, the BYD battery electric bus offers the lowest life cycle cost of ownership. The BYD electric bus delivers a host of operational and environmental benefits for public transit riders, bus operators and residents of the community – it is very quiet and ensures a comfortable ride without vibrations, jerks or the noise associated with the conventional buses and combustion engines. The bus can also drive for more than 155 miles even in heavy city traffic on a single charge. As of April 1st, 2015 , BYD bus fleets have completed greater than 50 million miles \"in revenue service\" and have been evaluated by more than 150 cities in 36 countries around the world. To date, BYD has built over 5,000 electric buses globally, making it by far the most popular electric transit vehicle on the planet.\nABOUT BYD Motors Inc.:\nBYD Motors Inc. is an American manufacturing company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BYD Company Ltd , the largest domestic auto-manufacturer and electric-bus manufacturer in China.
