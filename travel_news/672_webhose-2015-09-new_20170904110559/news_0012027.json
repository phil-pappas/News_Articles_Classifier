The tour of the 235-room hotel property emphasized the important role the hotel industry plays in supporting jobs and economic growth in the surrounding upstate New York area, as well as the various career opportunities within the hotel industry.\nThe hotel tour was led by the Sheraton Syracuse University Hotel and Conference Center General Manager David Heymann. Representative Mark Dorr from the New York State Hospitality & Tourism Association also participated in the tour. The “Heart of the House” hotel tour provided Congressman Katko and his staff an opportunity to walk through the property, meet with employees and get a deeper understanding of the impact the hotel industry has on the local economy.\n“It was a pleasure to tour the Sheraton Syracuse University Hotel and Conference Center today. Hotels are a significant generator in boosting the state and local economies, and the Sheraton is a well-known and well-liked property in the heart of Syracuse that creates good jobs, generates revenue and attracts locals and visitors alike,” said Congressman Katko. “Not only does this hotel greatly contribute to the economic hub around Central New York, but the industry is a key driver of travel and tourism across New York State.”\nNew York’s hotels are an important segment of the state economy more than 13 percent of all jobs in the state directly or indirectly related to the lodging industry. New York generates $7.8 billion in tax revenue for the state and local governments. Many of New York’s properties are small businesses, a segment of the economy responsible for 51 percent of jobs in the state. This industry reaches beyond simply providing guests with comfortable room or convenient meeting spaces – they are interlinked with many other industries such as, transportation, restaurants, agriculture, manufacturing, and recreation, supporting $62.5 billion in total sales throughout the state.\n“Congressman Katko understands the importance of supporting local businesses and knows how essential the hotel industry is to New York State’s jobs and economy,” said General Manager David Heymann. “We applaud his efforts to increase travel and tourism across Central New York while working on ways to promote economic growth and development so that hotels like ours can continue to succeed.”\nThe American Hotel & Lodging Association (AH&LA), the sole national association representing all segments of the 1.8 million-employee lodging industry, works with state associations to engage with members of Congress on the “Heart of the House” hotel tours, which provide an in-depth look at the career opportunities available as well as the economic impact the lodging industry has on the local, state and national economies.\nSource:- AHLA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T10:28:56.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
