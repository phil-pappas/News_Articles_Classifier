It’s official: The capital’s appetite for floriculture has never been stronger.\nPerhaps it’s an innate reaction to the lack of verdant space in this sprawling, grayscale metropolis, or the need to feel an authentic, earthy connection with non-Wi-Fi-emitting objects? And, of course, there’s no denying the influence of the Fall 2015 fashion shows , which cultivated a strong affinity for all things flora and fauna this season—from Dior’ s haute greenhouse, complete with lavender-hued Astroturf that served as a vibrant backdrop to elegant, tulip-shaped silhouettes, to Prada’ s sublime candy-color floral brooches and the magnificent bloom brocades on offer at Erdem.\nHere, we talk to three of London’s most innovative new florists and botanists who are defying conventions with their chic and contemporary arrangements.\nPetalon Hackney-based Florence Hill launched her bespoke bouquets-by-bicycle service just over a year ago, with the aim of providing Londoners with beautiful but modestly priced arrangements. Her wild and whimsical bouquets are handcrafted daily, using seasonal British flowers from New Covent Garden market.\nWhat inspires your designs?\nThere’s a whole network of brilliant emerging florists on Instagram who regularly post pictures of their beautiful creations, and I find that so inspiring. Even if you don’t like the idea of arranging, you can’t help but be drawn to these incredible blooms. My favorite is a Cornish florist called The Blue Carrot.\nDescribe your signature style.\nI didn’t train traditionally, and so I feel that’s allowed me the artistic freedom to really experiment with my arrangements. While it’s taken a lot of practice, there have never been any guidelines, so each bouquet feels special and sentimental.\nWhat is your ultimate flower of choice this season?\nIt’s difficult to choose, but I love vernaculus and anemones. They’re hardy, come in the most amazing colors, and their petals go slightly translucent as they age, which makes them all the more beautiful.\nWhat is your favorite green space in London?\nProbably right here in De Beauvoir Town [northeast London], where my studio is based. It’s such a pretty little pocket of London and has some incredible front gardens with dramatic floral displays. There’s definitely some competitive rose-growing going on. In the summer it all looks quite spectacular.\nThe Flower Appreciation Society British illustrator Anna Day and textile designer Ellie Jauncey formed The Flower Appreciation Society in 2009, after meeting in a North London pub and discovering that they shared a mutual frustration with traditional flower arrangements. From their bloom-bedecked North London studio, the dynamic duo dreams up unconventional bouquets that are bursting with personality, texture, and color. Last month they launched their inaugural book, The Flower Appreciation Society: An A to Z of All Things Floral , a delicate compendium of flower varieties, illustrated by Day.\nWhat is your signature style of arranging?\nAnna Day: Wild, natural, romantic, never restrained or composed. We’re both fascinated with unusual combinations of color and textures, and I think that probably stems from our backgrounds in design.\nEllie Jauncey: Although we never subconsciously reference art, there are elements that inform our work, from the colors of a Dutch masters painting to the lines of a modern British sculpture.\nWhat is The Flower Appreciation Society trademark?\nEJ: We’re best known for our oversize floral crowns. They’ve become so popular that we now conduct flower-crown classes and parties here at our studio and occasionally at festivals such as Port Eliot.\nAD: We also try to use native British flowers wherever possible, and you’ll notice that our arrangements tend to be tied with handwritten labels.\nWhat is your favorite green space in London?\nAD: The Dalston Eastern Curve Garden is absolutely beautiful—it’s a community garden that used to be a railway line, and has such an incredible array of flowers, herbs, and plants.\nEJ: It’s remarkably quiet and peaceful, considering it’s situated in the busiest part of Dalston. [ laughs ] And it has an incredible scent.\nWhat’s next for The Flower Appreciation Society?\nAD: I think we would both love to introduce some ceramics in the future. But right now we’re concentrating on growing the business organically, and just enjoying the day-to-day. We both really do love what we do, so that helps!\nBotany\nAngela Maynard’ s inspiring new concept boutique has become a coveted hot spot on Hackney’s Chatsworth Road, and offers a carefully considered curation of unusual plants and foliage arrangements, alongside contemporary ceramics by local artisans, organic candles, handmade soaps, and vintage books of botanical illustrations.\nWhat prompted you to start Botany?\nI felt that there wasn’t anywhere for someone like me, who lives in a flat [apartment], to go and buy unusual plants in London. I studied as a designer, but I’m more practical, and I love sourcing products and wanted to create a calming, pure environment by hunting out nature in the city. That’s what I’ve tried to do here at Botany.\nWhen did you decide to become a florist?\nI feel that I’ve always played out my creativity through plants, so this was quite a natural decision. I’ve always been fascinated by flowers—I had a flower press as a child and would collect botanical illustration books, hence the name Botany.\nWhat is your favorite green space in London?\nThere’s a beautiful secret pathway that runs through Islington called the New River Walk , and it feels like a best-kept secret. It’s so tranquil, with rivers, benches, and weeping willow trees, despite the fact that you’re in the heart of the city.\nWhat is the plant that you’re most drawn to?\nI love Swedish ivy. They are not very easy to get ahold of—the variety I have at home is rare; it’s just really beautiful. It was the first difficult plant that as an adult I managed to cultivate and keep alive!\nWhat is the next big trend in botany?\nI don’t try and anticipate what people might like. I’m very conscious that I don’t want Botany to be trend-led at all. I just source objects and plants that I feel passionate about, that really fit my aesthetic.", "external_links": ["http://www.petalon.co.uk/", "http://dalstongarden.org/", "http://www.theflowerappreciationsociety.co.uk/", "http://www.islington.gov.uk/services/parks-environment/parks/your_parks/greenspace_az/greenspace_n/Pages/new_river.aspx", "http://www.botanyshop.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-09-18T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T07:25:55.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
