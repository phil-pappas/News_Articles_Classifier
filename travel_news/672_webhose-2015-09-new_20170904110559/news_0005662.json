He thought the photographs had been destroyed in an attic fire at his mother's house years ago\nMangia came across the old prints in a box while he was cleaning out his apartment last year which shows life in the East Village during the early 1980s\nDuring that time, Mangia was co-publisher of the newspaper The Other Paper which had an office located on East Fifth Street in an area that was at the time, 'flush with crime, heroin and urban decay'\nDuring a snowy day in the 1980s, Mangia's photograph captures an image of two emergency responders providing aid to a man\nDuring that time, Mangia was a co-publisher of The Other Paper, a paper he refers to as 'a voice of a community', namely the Lower East Side and Alphabet City, which lasted between 1980 and 1981.\nThe area was at the time, 'flush with crime, heroin and urban decay' and was populated by squatters, artists, 'the leftover sixties love children' and incoming punk rockers.\nIt was also largely populated by Puerto Rican families who moved into the area during the sixties, according to Mangia.\n Stunning moment a SEAL photobombs the Milky Way Amy Winehouse through her family's eyes: Tragic singer's...

He said at the time, the city was more photographically interesting than it is today.\nLooking at the prints, they brought memories of drug raids and overdoses, social change without social media and abandoned tenements flooding back to Mangia.\nThe photographs also brought back memories of the many faces he would see as he walked on the sidewalks of the Lower East Side or of the up-and-coming new waver and local legend that might have been spotted inside of nightclubs such as Max's Kansas City, Mudd Club and Danceteria.\nThe photographs brought back memories of the many faces he would see as he walked on the sidewalks of the Lower East Side\nThe prints also brought back memories of drug raids and overdoses, social change without social media and abandoned tenements flooding back to Mangia\nHe also remembered the up-and-coming new waver and local legend that might have been spotted inside of nightclubs such as Max's Kansas City, Mudd Club and Danceteria\nEventually, though, came in gentrification and the East Village Mangia once knew began disappearing.
