I regret that he will be leaving the Association, but respect his decision to retire next year after a long and successful career in aviation. The search will now start for a successor to be appointed at the next IATA Annual General Meeting in Dublin in June 2016. In the meantime the board will continue to guide and support Tony and his team in their mission to deliver a safe, efficient and sustainable airline industry.”\nTyler said, “After five years as director general and CEO of IATA, I believe it will be time for me to retire and leave the organisation. It is a great privilege and responsibility to lead IATA, and I am proud of what the IATA team is achieving during my term of office. I greatly appreciate the support I receive from the board of governors and the membership at large, and from my colleagues. I remain fully committed to leading IATA until my successor is appointed in June next year.”\nFirst Published on September 01, 2015 5:43 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T01:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T16:29:32.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
