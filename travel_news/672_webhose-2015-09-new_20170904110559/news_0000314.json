A FRIEND asked me recently if it was true that corruption has a negative effect on economic growth. He had heard that there was strong evidence in support of that conclusion. With the barrage of public and private sector scandals — from Hitachi to Volkswagen — if it is true, then we are headed for worse times than we are seeing on the growth front. But thinking about it, theoretically, it may be that corruption has a more positive effect in the short term.\nOn the face of it, it would appear that it is naturally the case that corruption would lead to poor economic outcomes. As we consider corruption a social ill, which must detract from social esteem and morality, it must also be logical that it detracts from social advance, which we have for years assumed is represented by economic growth. But does it?\nEvidence on the relationship is very dicey, especially relating to the short term. The first problem is that it is extremely difficult to create scientific measures of corruption as it is by its nature a clandestine occurrence. Evidence of corruption is often more anecdotal than not. Even at the level where we narrowly define corruption as bribery, it is difficult to pin it down as it is difficult to prosecute and convict people.\nEconomists tend to focus on their fancy models to draw conclusions about the nature and causes of things. In order to do that, they need data to put into their statistical models and pop out findings and make inferences about what is or isn’t caused or related to something else.\nWhere would we look for data for corruption? In crime statistics? One doubts whether, if corruption were so well captured in crime statistics in neat data series of convictions and amounts, it would still be regarded as a problem. Shouldn’t it mean that a clandestine pursuit would cease to be if it was such a public occurrence?\nIn SA, there are some numbers in the public arena that we see as corruption. An example would be the auditor-general’s reports, which often speak of \"irregular\", \"wasteful\" and \"fruitless\" expenditure. But these are not economic terms, and are hardly even legal ones. These are more the inventions of accountants who speak to particular and set protocols and controls.\nIn economics, there is no such thing as wasteful or fruitless expenditure. Money is never wasted unless it is dug into a hole and left to disintegrate into the soil.\nIf it is paid to someone, it forms part of the economic cycle. It passes through hands of economic agents, allowing the exchange of goods and services.\nExpenditure is understood to be growth-inducing by its nature.\nIf a government department \"wastes money\" buying laptops it doesn’t need, or renting a building it doesn’t use, that money lands up in the hands of the seller or landlord, who uses it to purchase all manner of things in the economy.\nIn cases where the government spends double on a road, two things are likely to happen. First, we would expect that the economy would expand from the benefit in investment in road infrastructure. We would also expect that the rent-seeker goes out and builds a big house, buys fancy cars and splurges on expensive goods.\nThis consumption should be growth-inducing too, depending on where the goods are produced or bought. But we will come back to that later.\nThere are economists who have been pushing the government to spend more, insisting that the more governments spend; the faster economies recover from depressions or economic slumps. So, \"irregular\" expenditure on fighter jets should be growth-inducing too.\nSome have argued that the perception of corruption is enough to frighten off private or international investors. And as investment is important for growth, this would affect growth. But this is also a difficult one. I would challenge the reader to imagine a country known for corruption. And think about how many articles or people you’ve heard talk about investing in that place. Even in places wrought with conflict and run by dictators, investment is still flowing, and often at high rates.\nPerhaps a more devastating theory on rent-seeking comes from the International Monetary Fund, which argues that \"where rent-seeking proves more lucrative than productive work, talent will be misallocated. Financial incentives may lure the more talented and better educated to engage in rent-seeking rather than in productive work, with adverse consequences for the country’s growth rate. And that in the long term, if money is spent on the wrong things, growth will be impeded.\"\nBut as one famous economist put it, \"In the long term, we are all dead.\"\n• Payi is an economist and head of research at Nascence Advisory and Research", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T13:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:41:55.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
