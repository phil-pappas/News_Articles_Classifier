Both English and French are spoken here. The bilingual city is strewn with cathedrals, exuding rich European charms. It has earned its reputation as \"Little Paris\" in North America . In the old section of the city, travelers can cruise through elegant streets of French style and old castles on a horse-drawn sightseeing wagon, or trek up to the top of Mount Royal in the last glow of the sunset, taking in the tranquil Saint Lawrence River that flows slowly and the golden Gothic spires whose reflections are caught by ripples. This laidback city attracts hordes of travelers from around the world.\nThe forthcoming Beijing - Montreal service is part of Air China's move to solidify its presence on the China - Canada market, meeting the ever increasing demand for air travel between the two countries. Currently, Air China offers 10 flights per week between China and Canada . By its strategic joint operations with Air Canada, a member carrier of the Star Alliance, Air China puts its code on Air Canada's flights between Vancouver and other six selected Canadian cities including Edmonton , Calgary , Winnipeg , Toronto , Ottawa and Montreal . The Beijing - Montreal service will not only promote the economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries, but also benefit travelers between Southeast Asia , Japan and South Korea on one side and Montreal on the other, offering more easy and convenient travel options for connecting passengers between Asia and the Americas and other parts of the world.\nIn 2015, Air China has been cementing its global route network with its hub in Beijing and expanding its footprint in the Americas. After Air China put Boeing 747-8, a new member of the Boeing 747 family, into service on its Beijing - New York route at the beginning of the year and increased its Beijing - Los Angeles service to three daily flights in May, the forthcoming Beijing - Montreal service will be a worthy addition to the carrier's existing Beijing - Vancouver nonstop service. Currently, Air China serves 7 destinations in North America , including New York , Washington , Los Angeles , San Francisco , Houston , Vancouver and Hawaii , offering over 140 flights per week operated with Boeing 777-300ER and Boeing 747-8 aircraft. Comfortable cabin environment and attentive services guarantee passengers a truly pleasant travel experience.\nAbout the flights\nThe flights CA879/CA880 Beijing - Montreal are operated three times a week on Tuesday, Friday and Sunday. The outbound flight departs from Beijing at 13:00 Beijing time and arrives in Montreal at 13:50 local time. The return flight departs from Montreal at 16:20 local time and arrives in Beijing at 18:00 the following day. The flights are to be operated with Boeing 777-300ER, an aircraft type quite popular with the world's business travelers. Its First Class and Business Class are outfitted with full-flat seats and a central bar. All classes of service offer personal AVOD, power outlets, accessible toilets for the disabled and mood lighting system which can mimic the wonderful moments from sunrise to sunset, guaranteeing a truly pleasant journey for passengers.\nAbout Air China\nAir China is China's only national flag carrier and a member carrier of the world's largest airline network - Star Alliance.\nBy Aug 2015 , Air China had a fleet of 523 passenger aircraft and freighters of mainly Boeing and Airbus families (including those of the carriers which Air China has a majority stake in). It operates 350 routes, including 87international routes, 16regional routes and 247 domestic routes. It serves 168 cities in 35 countries and regions, including 58 international cities, 4 regional cities and 106 domestic cities. Every week, Air China offers over 1.47 million seats on over 7700 flights per week.\nUtilizing its extensive route network and its hub in Beijing , especially after its admission to the Star Alliance, Air China can fly passengers to 1,328 airports in 195 countries.\nPhoenixMiles, Air China's customer loyalty program created in 1994, is Asia's only frequent flyer program shared by a number of carriers.\nAir China's customer service philosophy revolves around four elements: credibility, convenience, comfort, and choice. Hard work over the years has resulted in a tremendous increase in Air China's brand value. In 2013, Air China ranked again as one of the world's top 500 brands with a brand value of RMB 91.899 billion , and was the only Chinese carrier on the World Brands 500 list.\nFor more, visit Air China's official website www.airchina.com or call Air China's hotline 95583.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20141017/152745LOGO\n releases/air-china-to-start-beijing-montreal-service-offering-easy-access-to-north-americas-little-paris-300140603.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20141017/152745LOGO", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/air-china-to-start-beijing-montreal-service-offering-easy-access-to-north-americas-little-paris-300140603.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20141017/152745LOGO", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=CN98217&Transmission_Id=201509092244PR_NEWS_USPR_____CN98217&DateId=20150909", "http://www.airchina.com/"], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T09:52:07.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
