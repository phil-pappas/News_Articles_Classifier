After 15 months she successfully sold the business, and in 2006 her experiences inspired her to found Enterprise Nation – a small-business network that now offers guidance to 75,000 users. Every year, Enterprise Nation hosts StartUp, a single-day event held at Somerset House that aims to unite business leaders with the UK’s brightest young companies. In March 2011 Ms Jones joined forces with seven other entrepreneurs to create StartUp Britain, a national campaign that aimed to accelerate British enterprise, supporting existing businesses and facilitating the creation of new ventures. The following year, as part of the Queen’s Jubilee Birthday Honours List, she was awarded an MBE for Services to Enterprise. • Win a state-of-the-art Canon printer for your SME »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T18:28:34.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
