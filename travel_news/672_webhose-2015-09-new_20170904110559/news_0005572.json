Cruise-focused agents go through extensive training as well as visit ships regularly to provide incredible travel advice.

Agents can also provide counsel to travelers thinking about everything from travel insurance to dining times to cabin location.\nDiscounts & Deals: In most cases, travel agents have access to deals and discounts that aren't available to consumers booking directly. Agents sometimes have the ability to book-in-bulk so clients are privy to lower pricing for booking through an agent. As a bonus, the majority of agents are paid through commission so there isn't an out-of-pocket expense for their services.\nPerks & Personalized Travel: Travel agents want travelers to be happy and what is one way to make that happen? Perks! Most agents can offer clients incredible perks, like complimentary bottles of wine, prepaid gratuities and onboard spending money. In addition to fun extras, agents can also arrange personalized travel details for your cruise like gluten-free dining or post-cruise transportation home.\nA Stress-Free Travel Experience: For a stress-free travel experience, identify a credentialed cruise specialist. Many agents become accredited cruise counselors through CLIA's Seascape Academy or take courses through the different cruise lines to elevate their expertise in cruise vacation experiences.
