Voters agreed in 2012 to tax themselves for a roughly $300 million project that’s now going to cost more than $410 million.\nThis was a surprise because Mayor Ed Murray said in February that the seawall project was on budget and on schedule. That was reiterated in April, when his staff updated the City Council.\n Also surprising was Murray’s declaration that $71 million worth of seawall overruns can be covered with “ unallocated sources of funds ” and no tax increase. The plan is to issue bonds that will be paid off with existing real-estate and parking taxes.\nYou could argue that this still affects taxes, one way or another.\nIf there was $71 million under the mattress, the city could have taken less from property owners to pay for the seawall. Or perhaps the city could have used some of its “unallocated” funding to reduce the size of its breathtaking $930 million “Move Seattle” levy proposal.\nYes, the seawall is complicated. Of course it was going to hit snags. That expectation should have been built into the budget.\nAccountability is difficult because of the city’s revolving door. Mayor Mike McGinn started this project and now it must be finished by Murray, who was in charge when the budget went haywire.\nMurray said he’ll now have experts review the project. We’ve heard that before. They’ll join experts Murray brought aboard in 2014 to help manage the project. They’ll also backfill a hole created in October when Murray’s waterfront project manager resigned, less than a year into the job.\nSadly, this is just the start of Seattle’s grand waterfront redevelopment, a $1 billion project that will take years to finish. Work has yet to start on half of the seawall’s length, including a stretch below Belltown that isn’t yet funded.\nRightly or wrongly, Seattle voters are also influenced by glitches in state road projects. The backdrop for Seattle’s levy request includes the troubled Highway 520 bridge replacement and Bertha’s frustrating lack of progress in drilling a tunnel along the waterfront. The latter directly affects the seawall project.\nThese are three of the largest infrastructure projects in the state. Their assorted problems contribute to a wider perception that Seattle is a sinkhole for road dollars. This negatively affects statewide support for transportation funding.\nIt doesn’t help that all three are happening at once in the same city.\nRemedying these perceptions requires extraordinary planning and cooperation.\nAdding to the complexity is tension between the city, state and contractors over costs and liabilities as they drill, dig and pound their way along Elliott Bay. This strains project managers, inhibits communication and tests leadership.\nMurray’s pledge to be more transparent about seawall costs going forward is welcomed.\nPerhaps he should go further and provide weekly or monthly updates including a timeline showing how the seawall and other major projects are tracking with schedules.\nA continuously updated gauge showing where costs are in relation to the budget would also help the public know how its dollars are being spent.\nThese are small steps toward convincing a skeptical city that it should reach far deeper into its wallet for new transportation projects.\nThe breakthrough will come if and when City Hall specifies how all of this spending will affect traffic and everyone’s ability to visit and get around Seattle.\nEditorial board members are editorial page editor Kate Riley, Frank A.
