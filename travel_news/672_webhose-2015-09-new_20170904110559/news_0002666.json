Colourfully decorated cattle, the sound of cowbells and a wonderful festival atmosphere – that is what you can expect at the mountain cattle drive in the Allgäu Alps.\nThe mountain cattle drive, the Almabtrieb, takes place every September and October in southern Germany.\nAfter spending the summer on the lush mountain pastures, the cattle, decorated with colourful garlands, are driven down to the valley and handed back to their owners. On the previous day you can also take a look behind the scenes and watch as preparations are made for the cattle drive on the mountain pastures.\nThis magnificent spectacle is celebrated in the villages with traditional music, dancing and all manner of food and drink.\nSource: GNTB", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T00:25:29.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
