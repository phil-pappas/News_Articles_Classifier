We have heard it can be hard to get a Russian visa and may be turned back at the airport. If we gain entry into Russia how can we pre-book travel to St Petersburg and on to Helsinki? We are spending a week in Russia and doing this independently. \nA. \nWe highly recommend booking your Russian travel with your travel agent â€“ they can assist you with your visa application. The Russian embassy requires an invitation from a Russian tour operator and an accompanying travel voucher, as well asan invoice showing proof that your travel arrangements have been paid in full. As this is written in Russian, you can't always be sure you have all the correct information, which is why using a visa specialist is highly recommended. If you have booked your travel arrangements with a travel agent in NZ, then they will also need to provide a covering letter to accompany all your visa application documents. \nThis is not to say you cannot travel independently, it just means a bit of pre-travel planning is required. \n- Glenn Warrington, travel consultant, House of Travel Ponsonby \nGot a travel question?
