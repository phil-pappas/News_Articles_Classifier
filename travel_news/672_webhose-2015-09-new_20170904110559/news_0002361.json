For the third quarter of 2015, U.S. GAAP net income, which included unrealized losses on fuel derivatives of $137 million , was $1.2 billion , or $1.56 diluted EPS down slightly from the prior year. For the third quarter of 2014, U.S. GAAP net income, which included net unrealized gains on fuel derivatives of $15 million , was $1.2 billion , or $1.60 diluted EPS. Revenues for the third quarter of 2015 were $4.9 billion , in line with the prior year.\nCarnival Corporation & plc President and Chief Executive Officer Arnold Donald noted, \"Our third quarter non-GAAP performance was the strongest of any quarter on record with earnings $0.17 per share higher than the prior year despite a slight drag from the net impact of fuel prices and currency. Non-GAAP earnings for the quarter were also $0.17 higher than the mid-point of prior guidance. Net revenue yields improved 5 percent (constant currency) from the prior year benefiting from strong demand which led to higher occupancy levels, increased ticket prices and increased onboard spending. Clearly our ongoing investments in the guest experience, combined with our global marketing and public relations efforts along with our initiatives to leverage our scale are having a positive impact.\"\nKey metrics for the third quarter 2015 compared to the prior year were as follows:\nOn a constant dollar basis, net revenue yields (net revenue per available lower berth day or \"ALBD\") increased 4.3 percent for 3Q 2015, better than June guidance of up 2 to 3 percent. Gross revenue yields decreased 2.1 percent in current dollars. Net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD increased 1.0 percent in constant dollars, better than June guidance of up 2 to 3 percent due to the timing of certain expenses. Gross cruise costs including fuel per ALBD in current dollars decreased 9 percent. Fuel prices declined 33 percent to $439 per metric ton for 3Q 2015 from $650 per metric ton in 3Q 2014 and were less than June guidance of $492 per metric ton. Fuel consumption per ALBD decreased 2 percent in 3Q 2015 compared to the prior year. Other highlights during the third quarter included Princess Cruises' announcement that the Golden Princess will begin sailing out of Tianjin, China on a seasonal basis starting in 2016, which totals six Carnival Corporation vessels based in China , the largest capacity commitment from any cruise company. Additionally, it was announced in July that two vessels in the four-ship newbuild contract with Meyer Werft shipyard will be earmarked for Costa Cruises and will be the largest ships ever built based on guest capacity. Like the two previously announced AIDA Cruises ships that will also be constructed by Meyer Werft , the Costa ships will be powered at sea by Liquefied Natural Gas, the world's cleanest burning fossil fuel. Last week, Carnival Corporation announced its new sustainability goals, which include a further reduction in CO 2 emissions of 25 percent by 2020 from the company's 2005 baseline, along with a fleetwide reduction in shipboard waste generation and improved water usage.\nOutlook\nBased on the strength in third quarter net revenue yields and current booking trends, the company has increased its expectations for full year 2015 net revenue yields. The company now expects revenue yields to be up approximately 4 percent compared to the prior year versus previous guidance of up 3 to 4 percent on a constant currency basis, which excludes translational and transactional currency impacts (up approximately 3 percent on a constant dollar basis). The company continues to expect full year 2015 net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD to be up approximately 3.5 percent compared to the prior year on a constant currency basis (up approximately 3 percent on a constant dollar basis).\nTaking the above factors into consideration, the company has increased its full year 2015 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance to be in the range of $2.56 to $2.60 , better than both the June guidance range of $2.35 to $2.50 and 2014 non-GAAP diluted earnings of $1.93 per share.\nDonald stated, \"In 2015, we are on track to achieve a nearly 35 percent earnings improvement and we are accelerating progress toward achieving double digit return on invested capital in the next three to four years. Our improved performance has driven even stronger operating cash, which is expected to exceed $4 billion this year. We remain committed to further enhancing shareholder returns as demonstrated by our recent 20 percent increase in quarterly dividends.\"\nDuring the last quarter, fleetwide booking volumes for the first half of 2016 were running nearly 20 percent higher than the prior year relative to a capacity increase of less than 3 percent, at lower constant dollar prices. At this time, cumulative advance bookings for the first half of 2016 are well ahead of last year at lower constant dollar prices.\nDonald added, \"Looking forward to 2016, we have driven a significant lengthening of the booking curve and have less inventory remaining for the first half of 2016 than at this time last year, which bodes well for continued year-over-year revenue yield improvement. Although we already have a solid base of business for next year, we are working hard to maintain the momentum through our ongoing initiatives to create additional demand.\"\nFourth Quarter 2015 Outlook\nFourth quarter constant currency net revenue yields are expected to be up approximately 3 percent compared to the prior year (up approximately 1 percent in constant dollars). Net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD for the fourth quarter are expected to be higher by approximately 3 percent on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year (up approximately 2 percent in constant dollars).\nBased on the above factors, the company expects non-GAAP diluted earnings for the fourth quarter 2015 to be in the range of $0.36 to $0.40 per share versus 2014 non-GAAP earnings of $0.27 per share.\nSelected Key Forecast Metrics\nFull Year 2015\nFourth Quarter 2015\nYear over year change:\nCurrent\nDollars\nConstant Dollars\nCurrent\nDollars\nConstant Dollars\nNet revenue yields\n(2)%\n3%\n(2.5) to (3.5)%\n0.5 to 1.5%\nNet cruise costs excl. fuel / ALBD\n(2)%\n3%\n(1.5) to (2.5)%\n1.5 to 2.5%\nFull Year 2015\nFourth Quarter 2015\nFuel price per metric ton\n$405\n$366\nFuel consumption (metric tons in thousands)\n3,190\n810\nCurrency: Euro\n$1.12 to €1\n$1.12 to €1\nSterling\n$1.54 to £1\n$1.54 to £1\nAustralian dollar\n$0.76 to A$1\n$0.70 to A$1\nCanadian dollar\n$0.79 to C$1\n$0.75 to C$1\nConference Call\nThe company has scheduled a conference call with analysts at 10:00 a.m. EDT ( 3:00 p.m. BST ) today to discuss its 2015 third quarter results.

ALBDs assume that each cabin we offer for sale accommodates two passengers and is computed by multiplying passenger capacity by revenue-producing ship operating days in the period.\n(b)\nIn accordance with cruise industry practice, occupancy is calculated using a denominator of ALBDs, which assumes two passengers per cabin even though some cabins can accommodate three or more passengers. Percentages in excess of 100% indicate that on average more than two passengers occupied some cabins.\nCARNIVAL CORPORATION & PLC\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nConsolidated gross and net revenue yields were computed by dividing the gross and net cruise revenues by ALBDs as follows (dollars in millions, except yields) (a) (b):\nThree Months Ended August 31,\nNine Months Ended August 31,\n2015\n2015\nConstant\nDollar\n2014\n2015\n2015\nConstant\nDollar\n2014\nPassenger ticket revenues\n$ 3,631\n$ 3,869\n$ 3,719\n$ 8,891\n$ 9,478\n$ 9,144\nOnboard and other revenues\n1,102\n1,154\n1,084\n2,918\n3,051\n2,839\nGross cruise revenues\n4,733\n5,023\n4,803\n11,809\n12,529\n11,983\nLess cruise costs\nCommissions, transportation and other\n(603)\n(646)\n(638)\n(1,671)\n(1,808)\n(1,779)\nOnboard and other\n(170)\n(177)\n(165)\n(395)\n(413)\n(392)\n(773)\n(823)\n(803)\n(2,066)\n(2,221)\n(2,171)\nNet passenger ticket revenues\n3,028\n3,223\n3,081\n7,220\n7,670\n7,365\nNet onboard and other revenues\n932\n977\n919\n2,523\n2,638\n2,447\nNet cruise revenues\n$ 3,960\n$ 4,200\n$ 4,000\n$ 9,743\n$ 10,308\n$ 9,812\nALBDs\n19,794,882\n19,794,882\n19,671,265\n57,685,594\n57,685,594\n56,829,605\nGross revenue yields\n$ 239.10\n$ 253.73\n$ 244.14\n$ 204.72\n$ 217.20\n$ 210.85\n% (decrease) increase vs. 2014\n(2.1)%\n3.9%\n(2.9)%\n3.0%\nNet revenue yields\n$ 200.04\n$ 212.17\n$ 203.35\n$ 168.91\n$ 178.69\n$ 172.65\n% (decrease) increase vs. 2014\n(1.6)%\n4.3%\n(2.2)%\n3.5%\nNet passenger ticket revenue yields\n$ 152.96\n$ 162.81\n$ 156.62\n$ 125.17\n$ 132.96\n$ 129.60\n% (decrease) increase vs. 2014\n(2.3)%\n4.0%\n(3.4)%\n2.6%\nNet onboard and other revenue yields\n$ 47.09\n$ 49.36\n$ 46.74\n$ 43.74\n$ 45.73\n$ 43.05\n% increase vs. 2014\n0.8%\n5.6%\n1.6%\n6.2%\nConsolidated gross and net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD were computed by dividing the gross and net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel by ALBDs as follows (dollars in millions, except costs per ALBD) (a) (b):\nThree Months Ended August 31,\nNine Months Ended August 31,\n2015\n2015\nConstant\nDollar\n2014\n2015\n2015\nConstant\nDollar\n2014\nCruise operating expenses\n$ 2,408\n$ 2,536\n$ 2,676\n$ 7,100\n$ 7,487\n$ 7,793\nCruise selling and administrative expenses\n482\n511\n479\n1,497\n1,584\n1,501\nGross cruise costs\n2,890\n3,047\n3,155\n8,597\n9,071\n9,294\nLess cruise costs included above\nCommissions, transportation and other\n(603)\n(646)\n(638)\n(1,671)\n(1,808)\n(1,779)\nOnboard and other\n(170)\n(177)\n(165)\n(395)\n(413)\n(392)\nRestructuring expenses\n(14)\n(17)\n-\n(21)\n(26)\n-\nGains on ship sales and ship impairment, net\n2\n2\n-\n6\n6\n15\nNet cruise costs\n2,105\n2,209\n2,352\n6,516\n6,830\n7,138\nLess fuel\n(345)\n(345)\n(518)\n(996)\n(996)\n(1,569)\nNet cruise costs excluding fuel\n$ 1,760\n$ 1,864\n$ 1,834\n$ 5,520\n$ 5,834\n$ 5,569\nALBDs\n19,794,882\n19,794,882\n19,671,265\n57,685,594\n57,685,594\n56,829,605\nGross cruise costs per ALBD\n$ 145.95\n$ 153.92\n$ 160.38\n$ 149.03\n$ 157.26\n$ 163.53\n% decrease vs. 2014\n(9.0)%\n(4.0)%\n(8.9)%\n(3.8)%\nNet cruise costs per ALBD\n$ 106.28\n$ 111.60\n$ 119.59\n$ 112.96\n$ 118.41\n$ 125.59\n% decrease vs. 2014\n(11.1)%\n(6.7)%\n(10.1)%\n(5.7)%\nNet cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD\n$ 88.84\n$ 94.16\n$ 93.23\n$ 95.70\n$ 101.15\n$ 97.98\n% (decrease) increase vs. 2014\n(4.7)%\n1.0%\n(2.3)%\n3.2%\n(See next page for Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.)\nCARNIVAL CORPORATION & PLC\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (CONTINUED)\nNon-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share was computed as follows (in millions, except per share data) (b):\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nAugust 31,\nAugust 31,\n2015\n2014\n2015\n2014\nNet income – diluted\nU.S. GAAP net income\n$ 1,216\n$ 1,241\n$ 1,487\n$ 1,319\nRestructuring expenses (c)\n14\n-\n21\n-\nGains on ship sales and ship impairment, net (c)\n(2)\n-\n(6)\n(15)\nUnrealized losses (gains) on fuel derivatives, net (d)\n137\n(15)\n215\n(8)\nNon-GAAP net income\n$ 1,365\n$ 1,226\n$ 1,717\n$ 1,296\nWeighted-average shares outstanding – diluted\n781\n778\n781\n778\nEarnings per share – diluted\nU.S. GAAP earnings per share\n$ 1.56\n$ 1.60\n$ 1.91\n$ 1.70\nRestructuring expenses (c)\n0.02\n-\n0.03\n-\nGains on ship sales and ship impairment, net (c)\n-\n-\n(0.01)\n(0.02)\nUnrealized losses (gains) on fuel derivatives, net (d)\n0.17\n(0.02)\n0.27\n(0.01)\nNon-GAAP earnings per share\n$ 1.75\n$ 1.58\n$ 2.20\n$ 1.67\nNotes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(a)\nWe use net cruise revenues per ALBD (\"net revenue yields\"), net cruise costs per ALBD and net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD as significant non-GAAP financial measures of our cruise segments' financial performance. These measures enable us to separate the impact of predictable capacity changes from the more unpredictable rate changes that affect our business; gains and losses on ship sales and ship impairments, net; and restructuring expenses that are not part of our core operating business. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors and expanded insight to measure our revenue and cost performance as a supplement to our U.S. GAAP consolidated financial statements.\nNet revenue yields are commonly used in the cruise industry to measure a company's cruise segment revenue performance and for revenue management purposes. We use \"net cruise revenues\" rather than \"gross cruise revenues\" to calculate net revenue yields. We believe that net cruise revenues is a more meaningful measure in determining revenue yield than gross cruise revenues because it reflects the cruise revenues earned net of our most significant variable costs, which are travel agent commissions, cost of air and other transportation, certain other costs that are directly associated with onboard and other revenues and credit and debit card fees. Substantially all of our remaining cruise costs are largely fixed, except for the impact of changing prices and food expenses, once our ship capacity levels have been determined.\nNet passenger ticket revenues reflect gross passenger ticket revenues, net of commissions, transportation and other costs. Net onboard and other revenues reflect gross onboard and other revenues, net of onboard and other cruise costs. Net passenger ticket revenue yields and net onboard and other revenue yields are computed by dividing net passenger ticket revenues and net onboard and other revenues by ALBDs.\nNet cruise costs per ALBD and net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD are the most significant measures we use to monitor our ability to control our cruise segments' costs rather than gross cruise costs per ALBD. We exclude the same variable costs that are included in the calculation of net cruise revenues to calculate net cruise costs with and without fuel to avoid duplicating these variable costs in our non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, we exclude gains and losses on ship sales and ship impairments, net and restructuring expenses from our calculation of net cruise costs with and without fuel as they are not considered part of our core operating business.\nAs a result of our revision of 2014 cruise ship operating expenses, our previously reported results changed as follows (in millions, except per ALBD data):\nThree Months Ended\nAugust 31, 2014\nNine Months Ended\nAugust 31, 2014\nAs Previously Reported\nAs Revised\nAs Previously Reported\nAs Revised\nGross cruise costs per ALBD\n$160.11\n$160.38\n$163.24\n$163.53\nNet cruise costs per ALBD\n$119.32\n$119.59\n$125.29\n$125.59\nNet cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD\n$92.97\n$93.23\n$97.69\n$97.98\nU.S. GAAP net income\n$1,247\n$1,241\n$1,338\n$1,319\nNon-GAAP net income\n$1,232\n$1,226\n$1,315\n$1,296\nCARNIVAL CORPORATION & PLC\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (CONTINUED)\nWe have not provided estimates of future gross revenue yields or future gross cruise costs per ALBD because the quantitative reconciliations of forecasted gross cruise revenues to forecasted net cruise revenues or forecasted gross cruise costs to forecasted net cruise costs would include a significant amount of uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at these measures. As such, management does not believe that this reconciling information would be meaningful.\nIn addition, because our Europe, Australia & Asia (\"EAA\") cruise brands utilize the euro, sterling and Australian dollar as their functional currency to measure their results and financial condition, the translation of those operations to our U.S. dollar reporting currency results in decreases in reported U.S. dollar revenues and expenses if the U.S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies and increases in reported U.S. dollar revenues and expenses if the U.S. dollar weakens against these foreign currencies. Accordingly, we also monitor and report these non-GAAP financial measures assuming the 2015 periods' currency exchange rates have remained constant with the 2014 periods' rates, or on a \"constant dollar basis,\" in order to remove the impact of changes in exchange rates on the translation of our EAA brands. We believe that this is a useful measure since it facilitates a comparative view of the changes in our business in a fluctuating currency exchange rate environment.\nAlthough our constant dollar basis measure removes the foreign currency translational impact as discussed above, it does not remove the foreign currency transactional impact from changes in exchange rates on our brands' revenues and expenses that are denominated in a currency other than their functional currency. Historically the foreign currency transactional impact had not been significant when measuring the periodic changes in our results of operations. However, given the continuing expansion of our global business and the heightened volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, we believe the foreign currency transactional impact is more significant in measuring our 2015 results compared to 2014, than in previous years. Together, the foreign currency translational and transactional impacts discussed above are referred to as on the \"constant currency basis.\"\n(b)\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The presentation of our non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as substitute for, or superior to the financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There are no specific rules for determining our non-GAAP current and constant dollar financial measures and, accordingly, they are susceptible to varying calculations, and it is possible that they may not be exactly comparable to the like-kind information presented by other companies, which is a potential risk associated with using these measures to compare us to other companies.\n(c)\nWe believe that the gains on ship sales and ship impairment, net and restructuring expenses recognized in the three and nine months ended August 31, 2015 and 2014 are not part of our core operating business and, therefore, are not an indication of our future earnings performance. As such, we believe it is more meaningful for gains on ship sales and ship impairment, net and restructuring expenses to be excluded from our net income and earnings per share and, accordingly, we present non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share excluding these items.\n(d)\nUnder U.S. GAAP, the realized and unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives not qualifying as fuel hedges are recognized currently in earnings. We believe that unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives are not an indication of our earnings performance since they relate to future periods and may not ultimately be realized in our future earnings. Therefore, we believe it is more meaningful for the unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives to be excluded from our net income and earnings per share and, accordingly, we present non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share excluding these unrealized gains and losses.\nWe have not included in our earnings guidance the impact of unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives because these unrealized amounts involve a significant amount of uncertainty, and we do not believe they are an indication of our future earnings performance. Accordingly, our earnings guidance is presented on a non-GAAP basis only. As a result, we did not present a reconciliation between forecasted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance and forecasted U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance, since we do not believe that the reconciliation information would be meaningful. However, we do forecast realized gains and losses on fuel derivatives by applying current Brent prices to the derivatives that settle in the forecast period.\n releases/carnival-corporation--plc-reports-third-quarter-earnings-which-marks-the-companys-strongest-quarterly-non-gaap-performance-on-record-300146666.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.costacruise.com/", "http://www.fathom.org/", "http://www.carnivalplc.com/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.pocruises.com.au/", "http://www.princess.com/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=CL08003&Transmission_Id=201509220915PR_NEWS_USPR_____CL08003&DateId=20150922", "http://www.aida.de/", "http://www.carnival.com/", "http://www.pocruises.com/", "http://www.seabourn.com/", "http://www.carnivalcorp.com/", "http://www.cunard.com/", "http://www.hollandamerica.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/carnival-corporation--plc-reports-third-quarter-earnings-which-marks-the-companys-strongest-quarterly-non-gaap-performance-on-record-300146666.html"], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T16:44:21.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
