Ask your Gatwick airport taxi driver to recommend best spots along this lovely trail. \nThe River Thames is best known as the river that flows through London. In literature, the famous body of water has been dwelt upon by such figures as Charles Dickens, Arthur Conan Doyle, and William Wordsworth, who by and large remark upon the portion of the Thames that passes through the nation’s capital. However, there is much more of the Thames to be seen beyond London. \nVisitors who wish to get to know England’s longest river a little better might want to look into the Thames Path, a 184-mile stretch of trail that gives walkers and cyclists a chance to experience the quieter, more scenic stretches of this great river. If you’re flying into an airport south of London to tour the Thames area, you can ask your Gatwick airport taxi driver to recommend day walks on this scenic trail. \nThe Thames Path \nThe Thames Path is one of 15 National Trails in England and Wales. Opened in 1996, the path follows the length of the river from its source near Kemble, in Gloucestershire, through the heart of London, to the Thames Barrier at Charlton in the borough of Greenwich. The entire path length of 184 miles can be walked, and some parts can be cycled. Most of the Thames Path follows the original towpath, from which barges were pulled along the Thames. The path is mostly flat with some natural incline and provides an easy walking route that can accommodate even those with reduced mobility. \nThings to See and Do along the Thames Path \nThe Thames Path passes through meadows, rural villages and historic towns, so there are plenty of attractions to visit, no matter how far you plan to follow the path. \nOxford: This university town is rich with history, founded in the 8th century by the Saxons. It is best-known as being the home to the prestigious University of Oxford. The poet Matthew Arnold famously called Oxford “the city of dreaming spires” in acknowledgement of its stunning architecture. You can even experience Oxford by boat, by renting one of the punts available along the picturesque route. \nHampton Court Palace: One of two surviving palaces owned by the famous King Henry VIII, Hampton Court Palace offers a look back in time and some splendid Tudor architecture. Visitors can wander the corridors of power, wend their way through the garden maze, or watch a game of tennis at the royal tennis courts. \nThames Path Challenge: This annual challenge invites participants to walk, run, or jog sections of the Thames path (ranging from 25km to 100km). Over 4,000 participants have already registered for the 2015 Thames Path Challenge this September. \nGetting to the Thames \nIf you’re coming from abroad to experience the beauty of the Thames, you can fly into one of the six international airports in the London area - such as Stanstead or Gatwick Airport. Taxi transport can take you from the airport to your final destination and there is also a range of shared shuttle options and, of course, public transport. Gatwick airport taxi drivers will be happy to give advice on how best to enjoy the Thames region of England and they can make a valuable source of local information and tips.   from ArticlesFactory.com ABOUT THE AUTHOR \nLukas Johannes is a driver for Shuttle Direct.
