It can hold 40 pax in theatre-style on the lower deck and 30 in cocktail fashion on the upper deck. \nBCCK’s CEO, Eric Van Piggelen, said: “We are excited about this new product as it will allow associations to hold outdoor dining and themed events on the catamaran. It is this new product that will make us different from other convention centres in Asia. This will be our unique selling point and we will accommodate customised requests from clients – be it an event for privileged customers of a company or as a means to ferry our conference delegates back to their hotels at the Waterfront area through this scenic route.” \nSarawak Convention Bureau’s managing director, Mike Cannon, commented: “The services will enhance the delegate experience. The beautiful waterways offer (an authentic view) of the destination. It passes through villages, jungles and wetlands.” \nGracie V Geikie, director/ principal consultant of Planet Borneo Group of Companies, is eager to offer the catamaran as a venue for pre-dinner cocktails for conference speakers and important guests. \nMeanwhile, the state government will build an overhead bridge linking the convention centre to the jetty for the convenience of passengers. This facility will be ready in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T11:45:46.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
