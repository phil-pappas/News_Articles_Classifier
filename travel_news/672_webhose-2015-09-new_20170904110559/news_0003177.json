For years, operators of the Stanley Hotel have used “The Shining” and its paranormal plot as pure marketing gold: The resort retains an in-house psychic, offers ghost tours to tens of thousands of visitors a year, and hosts a film festival at which townspeople dress up as zombies and eat “brains.” Mr. Kubrick’s movie plays on a loop in hotel rooms, and the property’s owner, John W. Cullen, said the story had helped him turn the Stanley — which, aside from the horror tie-in, has amazing views of Rocky Mountain National Park — into an “economic fortress.” Missing from the experience, however, has been the hedge maze that Mr. Kubrick used as the setting for the film’s climax, in which the crazed winter caretaker of the hotel — played by a demonic-looking Jack Nicholson — chases his young son, Danny, with an ax. Danny, who has been having visions of ghosts, famously writes “Redrum” on the wall (read it backward if you have not seen the movie).

So, to celebrate the 20th year of his ownership of the hotel, Mr. Cullen gave in and built one in June. “People want an experience,” he said. “They want to reinterpret it and tell all their friends about it. And who am I to get in their way?” Photo Mairim Dallaryan Standing, an architect who won the hotel’s design contest, in the finished maze at the resort.

A panel of judges received 329 entries from around the world, and the winner was a New York architect named Mairim Dallaryan Standing. She called the honor the pinnacle of her career. “I was up until 1 in the morning every day, designing and drawing and sketching and trying to make it work mathematically before I submitted it,” Ms. Standing said in a telephone interview, adding that she was attracted to the challenge of the task, not necessarily its connection to a thriller. She received two trips to the hotel in exchange for her work. Mr. Cullen chose to form the maze from juniper trees that grow to just three feet high, making the Stanley’s maze far less imposing than the 13-foot labyrinth in the Kubrick film. Mr. Cullen said he was concerned about losing children in the maze. This summer, that decision has caused some disappointment.

Employees, she said, often feel pressure to whip up ghosts at a moment’s notice. “A lot of people come in,” she said, “and it’s like, ‘All right, where are they?’ ” \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T05:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T06:30:17.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
