What could be more fun than taking an air tour of the Grand Canyon? If that sounds like a good plan, then here are some tips for having a great time and getting a good deal. It's Going To Be Hot! Sure, summer is coming to an end, but that doesn't mean it's not going to be hot out at the canyon and the surrounding areas. Temperatures can soar about midday, so if you want to stay cool, pick a tour that leaves early in the morning or later in the afternoon. Flying at sunrise or sunset is not only cooler, the sky is beautiful then. The helicopters used on these tours offer climate control, so you'll be comfortable while you're in the air, but if you take a landing tour, be prepared for the intense heat when you get out of the chopper. Cover up with some light clothing, and bring a hat, sunglasses, and apply sunscreen before you head out on your tour. Fly In Comfort In An EcoStar 130 When you fly out from Las Vegas, you'll travel in a modern EcoStar 130 helicopter. You'll get optimum views from one of the helicopters, and your ride will be comfortable too. The cabin is larger than most commercial touring helicopters, and they have large stadium style seats, which allow for the perfect view for every passenger. As soon as you see the helicopter you will be impressed by the large windscreen, which wraps 180 degrees around the front of the helicopter. When you choose deluxe tours from Las Vegas, you will also receive a complimentary limousine shuttle. Deluxe helicopters depart directly from the Las Vegas Strip, whereas basic tours will require a standard shuttle service to nearby Boulder City. Las Vegas tours go out to the West Rim, and are the only Grand Canyon helicopters that can land inside the National Park. You can book a landing tour that lets you out on top of the rim or on the canyon floor Both experiences are breathtaking, and you can even combine the two if you have plenty of time to explore. South Rim Tours If you want to tour the South Rim, or if you will be in Arizona instead of Vegas, then you'll need to begin your helicopter tour in Tusayan. These tours are a totally different experience since they fly along the North and South Rims. There are two flights available. The first is a half-hour tour that goes to the remote North Rim, and then back to Tusayan. The second option follows a similar route, but adds on an eastern boundary extension. This longer tour is very comprehensive since it takes you over about 75 percent of the Grand Canyon National Park on its flight that lasts nearly an hour. You can't land inside the park, but you could take a Jeep tour from Tusayan. The Jeep tour is a fun way to add some adventure to your trip and see the canyon up close and personal. Combining an air tour with this Jeep tour could be exactly what you need to make the South Rim the best option for you. If you plan to be in Vegas, but you want to tour the South Rim, all you have to do is fly from Vegas to Tusayan by plane, which takes about an hour, and then you can begin your helicopter or Jeep tour. Book Early And Close Summer In Style Grand Canyon helicopter tours are always in high demand and even more so as visitors try to squeeze in one last flight as summer closes. You want to book your tour as soon as possible, and if you do it online with your credit card, you can get a good deal. The internet rate is the lowest price, plus you'll get instead confirmation of your seats. This may be the only way you can get one of the sunset or sunrise tours since they are so popular. Aim to book at least two weeks before you intend to fly, to ensure that seats are available for the day and time that you want them. Touring the Grand Canyon is always an exciting adventure. Seeing the massive chasm from the air is an unforgettable experience. Start planning your tour now, so you can enjoy a fun-filled summer adventure you'll never forget.
