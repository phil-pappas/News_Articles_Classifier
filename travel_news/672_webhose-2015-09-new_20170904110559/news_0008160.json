The first summer camp attracted 11 children, who spent a week touring the city of Lanzhou and grasslands in Gansu province. Since 1997, the number of children joining the camp has been about 1,000 each year. In 2009, the camp also opened to children of Bluestar’s foreign employees after the company became more international. It has since taken on a new role as a bridge between different cultures. “We want to transmit China’s image and culture through the eyes of foreign youngsters and also hope those children tell their parents what Bluestar and the Chinese are like when they go home,” Ms Liu said. We want to transmit China’s image and culture through the eyes of foreign youngsters Bluestar has made several overseas acquisitions since 2006 to accelerate its internationalisation. As of now, the state-owned enterprise owns five foreign companies, including Qenos in Australia, Elkem in Norway and two French companies, BSI and Adisseo. It also has more than 30 Chinese subsidiaries. The annual summer camp usually lasts 20 days and starts in July. Children, aged between eight and 15, of the chemical giant’s employees worldwide are eligible to attend. To date, more than 13,000 children have taken part in the summer camp. This year, 940 Chinese and foreign children participated in the camp, which started on July 20 and ran until Aug 10. Nearly 140 children, including 45 from eight overseas countries including France and Australia, were at the Beijing No 1 camp, one of 22 sites in 18 cities nationwide. Under the theme of “civilisation inheritance”, activities and the curriculum are designed to promote personal growth, social responsibility, corporate awareness and an understanding of international culture. A highlight of this year’s summer camp was the Nation’s Day held on July 31 at the Beijing camp. Children from France, Australia and Norway introduced the culture and customs of their home countries in fun and fresh ways. The French team sang a wellknown song called Champs-Elysees, the name of the most famous avenue in Paris. The Australian team performed a medley of Australian pieces that showcased different aspects of the local life, including Australian rules football; an imitation of Sia, a popular local singer; and a performance of Waltzing Matilda, a song “close to every Australian’s heart”, the team said. The camp is special because you can meet people from different countries and different cultures The Norwegian team performed a stage play based on the story of Peer Gynt by Henrik Ibsen. Jonathan Clancy, board member of Bluestar and chief executive of Qenos, attended the Nation’s Day celebrations with his wife and two children. “I have had the great privilege to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping twice in Australia and I listened to the Chinese Dream. There are eight parts of the Chinese Dream and one of those parts is Beautiful China,” Mr Clancy said. With a culture of tolerance, love and opening-up, the Bluestar international summer camp was a truly beautiful place to experience the Chinese Dream, he said. Laia, a Spanish girl whose mother works for Bluestar Silicones, said: “The camp is special because you can meet people from different countries and different cultures. I have made many new friends here.” In addition to doing sports and other activities, Laia and other foreign teenagers spent a weekend with the families of their Chinese friends. Having the foreign campers stay for a weekend with Chinese families will be a permanent part of the camp to help them understand Chinese life better. Nine, a French teenager, said this was her first time to attend a summer camp. “Everything is amazing here and everyone is happy to be here,” she said. The 13-year-old visited several popular tourist sites in Beijing, including Tian’anmen Square, the Forbidden City and the Great Wall.
