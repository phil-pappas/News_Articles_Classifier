It is an extraordinary site which could be one of the wonders of the world but remains an intimate experience. It comprises two interconnecting karstic limestone caves, spanning 5&frac12; miles.\nThere is a huge concentration of crystallised formations and extraordinary stone shapes, such as stalactites, stalagmites, columns, ponds and draperies.\nLike looking up at the clouds, the shapes in the caves can be interpreted in many ways: a couple embracing, a rabbit running away, dust in the wind. Our son saw them as melted chocolate, vanilla ice-cream drippings and huge mushrooms.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Jamal Saidi/Reuters/Corbis\nTo see the lower cave, we took a boat on the crystal-clear underground river, which feels like a fairytale – there is no scale of time or space. It is another territory, a parallel one, similar to the one we seek in art and cinema.\nWe know we’re underground but feel we’re also floating in space. Claustrophobia could be a worry but, in fact, we are dizzily overawed by the sheer scale of the place.\n• I Must First Apologise, the artists’ exhibition, is at HOME in Manchester, from 12 Sept-1 Nov, homemcr.org", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cxq7%2Fsfb%23img-2&ref=responsive", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/2/1441190047792/f0d42518-e1f6-4352-8bd8-2bdcfc9a5b1c-2060x1236.jpeg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=78a53470e6fc1ca730a30a82ecc69577", "http://homemcr.org/exhibition/joana-hadjithomas-khalil-joreige-must-first-apologise/", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Going+underground%3A+the+Jeita+Grotto%2C+Qornet+El+Hamra%2C+Lebanon&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Fsep%2F02%2Fjeita-grotto-lebanon-near-beiruit&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F9%2F2%2F1441190047792%2Ff0d42518-e1f6-4352-8bd8-2bdcfc9a5b1c-2060x1236.jpeg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/2/1441190047792/f0d42518-e1f6-4352-8bd8-2bdcfc9a5b1c-2060x1236.jpeg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=da10e31ce06bd3227c72bbb6d2f17fbc", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/2/1441190047792/f0d42518-e1f6-4352-8bd8-2bdcfc9a5b1c-2060x1236.jpeg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=5c633d55a649a2f67b4dc6ff216ebc58", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Going+underground%3A+the+Jeita+Grotto%2C+Qornet+El+Hamra%2C+Lebanon&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cxq7%2Fstw%23img-2", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/2/1441190047792/f0d42518-e1f6-4352-8bd8-2bdcfc9a5b1c-2060x1236.jpeg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=d7411db8442bbe698564a9b7ad0fa522"], "published": "2015-09-02T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T14:42:31.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
