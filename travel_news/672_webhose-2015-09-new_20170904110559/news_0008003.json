The intimate event brought corporate clients including representatives from Mattel together with the new members of the Beaumont Estate events team. \nDressed in weather appropriate outdoor gear guests arrived at the White House for a light lunch of power foods including grilled chicken, baked salmon, Moroccan spiced couscous with pomegranate seeds, mixed vegetables and a selection of fresh fruits. Lead instructor Scott Heffield hosted the action packed day. A former Commando in the Royal Marines who over the last 10 years has been putting his vast experience to work as a motivational expert for channels such as BBC1 and ITV and behind the camera with Bear Grylls as a rope safety and survival expert and stunt and logistics coordinator on shows including ‘Born Survivor’, ‘Get Out Alive’ and ‘The Island’. Guests were briefed on the new teambuilding experience and the challenges awaiting them based on the trials faced by Sir Ernest Shackleton and his crew on their voyage to cross Antarctica from sea to sea via the pole; known as the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition 1914-17. In the surrounding grounds of Beaumont Estate guests were thrust into a fun, energetic icebreaker before taking on a host of exciting challenges. Split into teams, guests were shown lifesaving rope and knot techniques which they needed to reproduce to earn points. After mastering the skill it was applied to a sledge drag of a Land Rover jeep in which both teams came together to manoeuvre through a weaving course. The team split again and were directed into the isolated woodland area of the Estate for a shipwreck scenario which involved fire and shelter building and wilderness food preparation. The final outdoor challenge saw teams put together a stretcher to carry their man down through a smoked bombed clearing in the woods to an awaiting (fictional) rescue transport. Guests were led back to the White House for a debrief with volunteers asked to take on one more challenge. Uncovering safety helmets volunteers steadied their nerves to drink urine (later unveiled as orange squash) and devour live locust and mealworms, chocolate coated crickets and pemmican. Participants were awarded prizes including a signed Bear Grylls book, a survival kit and a branded ‘I Survived’ t-shirt. All guests received a certificate of achievement, a pocket guide survival booklet and a woven badge as well as Sanctuary Spa products courtesy of Beaumont Estate. A short drinks reception was hosted for guests to unwind before free time to relax in their rooms. Later in the evening guests enjoyed a formal three course ‘Survivors Dinner’ with lead instructor Scott and his team.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T20:27:46.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
