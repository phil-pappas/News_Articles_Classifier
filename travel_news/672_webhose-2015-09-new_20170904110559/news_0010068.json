The brothers have already spent time surfing in Standhill, Sligo, with local surfer Seamus McGolderick, followed by lunch at Shells Café and then met with Neill Walton and experienced a seaweed bath at VOYA, immersing themselves in the Wild Atlantic Way’s finest natural produce, seaweed with its many health benefits.\nSpeaking about the visit, Fiona Monaghan, Head of the Wild Atlantic Way Programme, Fáilte Ireland, said –\n“It is a fantastic opportunity for Fáilte Ireland to showcase what the Wild Atlantic Way has to offer to audiences in important markets such as North America. North Americans are among the biggest spenders during their stay here in Ireland, so we welcome these top award-winning travel videographers who will spread the word on the Wild Atlantic Way to their readers and followers at home. With the dollar being so strong, we hope to see many more American visitors to our shores this year and to firmly put the Wild Atlantic Way on their ‘must-visit-soon’ list.”\nThe brothers will travel from Sligo today to Galway where they will spend time visiting Cnoc Suain, to get a fascinating insight into Irish culture, our traditional music, song and storytelling and experience the vibrant city of Galway on a walking tour. Following that they will fly to the Aran Islands and meet with Cyril O’Flaherty where he will bring them around the Island by pony and trap, giving them an in-depth introduction to the many facets of island life.\nNext on the itinerary is Cork where they experience a food tour of Cory city followed by a visit to the Jameson Whiskey distillery in Middleton to see the process of making the world famous Jameson Whiskey. Catch and cook in Kinsale – a morning spent fishing with local angler Butch Roberts on board the Sundance Kid, then back to Kinsale where they will meet with Carole from local restaurant Crackpots who will organise a cookery demonstration of their catch. A voyage of seaweed discovery by kayak with Jim Kennedy in Skibbereen will top their experiences on the Wild Atlantic Way.\nSource:- Failte Ireland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T18:12:45.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
