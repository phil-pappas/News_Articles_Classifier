Share article \nSergeant Heard added: “We must avoid any complacency because statistics suggest that motorcyclists remain the road user group with the highest rate of collisions and casualties per mile travelled. Motorcyclists make up just one per cent of total road traffic but account for 19 per cent of all road user deaths. \n“All of us have a responsibility to ‘Think Bike’ because many collisions with motorcycles can happen at junctions. It’s important for both drivers and riders to allow extra time to show mutual consideration and respect on the roads.” Promoted Stories More than 100 motorcyclists stopped in Hampshire Police safety crackdown Sorry, an error occurred.
