Of course, this time of togetherness will only make the bond of friendship stronger. This vacay will also bolster the confidence in yourself as you get ready to add a new dimension to your life.\nET-Travel is thinking long limo pick-ups from the airport at Prague, Czech Republic, endless nights at the casinos of Macau, wild parties at Las Vegas, beach-buddy chats at Rio De Janeiro and shopping in London.\n\nFor the ladies, of course the crazy beach parties in Thailand can be a great option, history-tours in Bucharest, relaxing spa sojourns in Bali and street art trails in Brazil. Just a word of caution: Do keep a copy of your passport, hotel details with your loved ones back home.\nWe are sure, you don't want to have a 'Hangover Part 4' in the making. So, soak it all, dance like no one's watching, meet and interact with locals, learn some new hobbies at your bachelor/hen party, it's something you will remember for a long time!\nBig cities & bright lights \nRegion: USA \nWhen you're planning a bachelor or bachelorette party, head to Las Vegas, which has exceptional museums, art exhibits, fine galleries, adventure sports, sailing and an amazing nightlife. Pump up your adrenaline behind the wheel of an exotic car or just drink and dance the night away in incredible bars and nightclubs of Miami, Los Angeles, Kansas, Chicago, Boston and New York City. Fancy a great sailing trip with your friends? Head to San Francisco Bay, a shallow estuary, and a mecca for sailors and tourists who would like to indulge in windsurfing and kite-surfing. There is also the Grand Canyon, so plan right and pack up!\nWow! factor: Empanadas are delicious on the streets of New York, Los Angeles and Miami. The health-conscious tourists try the baked version.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T04:20:36.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
