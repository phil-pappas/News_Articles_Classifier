Leave in the fridge overnight. The next day, wash off the salt and pat the duck legs dry with kitchen paper. Preheat the oven to its lowest setting, 100C/ 210F/Gas ¼. Place the duck in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. In a separate pan, gently melt the fat. Pour it over the legs to cover. Scrunch up a circle of waxed parchment paper the size of your casserole dish, then open it out and rest it on top of the fat. This prevents some evaporation but won’t create as much pressure as a lid. Roasting potatoes in duck fat gives prefectly crispy spuds Cook in the oven for eight hours (you can do this overnight). The legs are done when the knuckle bone can be wiggled easily. Leave to cool in the fat. If using straight away, carefully strain off the cooled fat. Keep some for the potatoes and chill the rest for future dishes. • Don't serve your duck pink?! That's quackers, say top chefs Set the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Put the potatoes in a large pan of cold water and bring to the boil. Add a generous pinch of salt and parboil for about 15 minutes until they begin to break up. Drain. Put 4 tbsp duck fat in a roasting tray and heat in the oven for 5 minutes. Carefully take out the tray and add the potatoes (don’t overfill, or they won’t crisp up). Roast for 45 minutes to an hour, basting with the fat occasionally to get an even golden colour. About 15 minutes in, put the duck legs skin-side down in an ovenproof frying pan with the thyme and garlic (you can add these at the dry-salt marinade stage, but I prefer to have unflavoured duck fat for other dishes). Cover the duck loosely with waxed parchment paper. • How Donald Duck helped win Second World War – and beat Mickey to the job Add to the oven for about 30 minutes, until the skin is crisp and golden brown. Just before the end, heat 2 tbsp water with 75g butter in a sauté pan until they form an emulsion. Add the cabbage, cover loosely with wax paper, and cook until the water has evaporated but the cabbage is still bright green, about 2 minutes. Season, add a squeeze of lemon and stir in 75g fresh butter. In a separate pan, gently fry the tomatoes and chipotle until they start to break down, like a textured ketchup. Serve with the duck, potatoes and cabbage. @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T18:27:29.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
