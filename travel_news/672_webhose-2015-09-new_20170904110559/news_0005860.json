Located in the northern tip of the country just outside the Atacama Desert, Iquique is renowned for having some of the best surfing in the world. With a population just under 183,000 people, you will find a city that is lively in culture, colorful in architecture, and cheap enough to stay for a week for as little as $200 U.S.D. \nPlaces to Stay on the Cheap \nBackpacker´s Hostel Iquique, is one of the better options for your buck. Rooms run at around $17 dollars a night and offers a communal kitchen (to cook your own meals) hammocks, WiFi, and an outside area to throw a BBQ if you so please. They also offer packages for surf-lessons and have an extremely accommodating front desk staff. \nPlaces to Eat on the Cheap \nSupermercado Rossi , is Iquique´s largest supermarket that offers fresh vegetables, cooking essentials, and food-for-on-the go. Most hostels in town have a communal kitchen so stocking up on food for the week and cooking your own meals is a great way to budget yourself. If you are hankering for a lunch or dinner out, try Ciccolata, a hearty little café offering serving real coffee, tasty sandwiches and mouth-watering pastries and cakes. \nPlaces to See on the Cheap \nSurfing is plentiful but don’t give into high-prices from the companies that charge gringo prices. Vertical Sports , offers some of the best surf instruction but the prices are a bit high. Sometimes just walking the coast of Playa Canvancha and inquiring around for lessons could save you a buck or two. \nHave you been to Iquique, Chile?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:49:29.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
