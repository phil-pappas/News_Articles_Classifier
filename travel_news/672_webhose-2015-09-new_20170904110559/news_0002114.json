The challenges faced by all 20 teams in the Air Race 1 World Cup were immense, being the first time in the 70-year history of the sport that racers had to compete across a series of international races. \nThe final race of the series was full of drama and gripping action that kept the spectators guessing about the outcome. The heat races in the days prior that lead to the final grid positions were tense and competitive requiring the ground crews to work long into each night on modifications and enhancements to extract every ounce of performance from the race machines. \nRichard won the top points in the final race, followed by Justin Phillipson, who was debuting his new airplane “No Strings Attached” that he and his brother built themselves. Philip Goforth had rebuilt his airplane “Knotty Girl” and changed to a new wing design, among other new improvements that helped him edge into third in the Nevada race. \nJeff Zaltman, CEO of Air Race 1, said: “Congratulations to Thom on a well-deserved victory! And congratulations to all the pilots and crews that launched this new world cup of the fastest and most demanding motorsport in the world.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T23:40:31.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
