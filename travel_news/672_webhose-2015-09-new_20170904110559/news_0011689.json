Organised by Sarawak Convention Bureau (SCB), the trip’s purpose was to shed true light on the State, its unique wildlife and beauty, traditions and heritage, culture of hospitality and world-class business events facilities. \nMs. Amelia Roziman, Global Marketing & Communications Director, explained that the FAM trip was organised as part of SCB’s “7 Wonders of Borneo” campaign – an essential part of SCB’s 2015 strategic plan to showcase what Sarawak has to offer to some of the regions most established markets. Amelia explained: “It’s only by being physically here in the heart of Borneo that our clients can truly appreciate what Sarawak has to offer as a business events destination. The feedback has been fantastic. Our guests enjoyed a tailor made programme, experiencing everything the Orang-utans of our ancient rainforests and Sarawak’s many indigenous tribes, to the State’s colonial history and world-class convention facilities. We hope they can impart this new knowledge to their peers, so we can transform Sarawak from being the region’s best kept secret, to a recognised global business events destination. With SCB, Sarawak can be proud of its 80% success rate track record in bidding over the last few years.” SCB’s clients visited the main attractions in Kuching, Mulu and Miri, including the Kuching Waterfront, Semenggoh Wildlife Centre, Sarawak Cultural Village and Gunung Mulu National Park. In addition, they had the opportunity to visit various hotels and venues for their future events in Sarawak. SCB’s programme also allowed their guests to experience the social activities of the FAM trip, which included the internationally-acclaimed Rainforest World Music Festival and Kayaking at Kampung Semadang. These activities were an integral part of the agenda, allowing SCB’s clients to better understand Sarawak as a holistic business-events destination, and what they could consider incorporating in their own business events programmes. “We have such strong support from the industry and this FAM trip is the result from our efforts as an experienced and matured industry player. Many thanks to our main supporter, Malaysian Airlines (Sydney), as well as Cat City Holidays, CPH Travel Agencies, Planet Borneo Tours, Hilton Kuching Hotel, Mulu Marriot and Spa, Meritz Hotel, Borneo Convention Centre Kuching, Sarawak Tourism Board and Event Horizons Management for making this FAM trip a great success,” Amelia added. Mr. Nick Koerbin, Executive Director of the Association Executive Services, had a complete change of perception of Sarawak as a result of the FAM trip: “This visit was a real eye-opener. To be frank, I was blown away by the outstanding facilities and logistical assistance provided in Sarawak, which far exceeds the antiquated perception of an exotic destination! With today’s challenging world economy, Sarawak proves to be an excellent value-for-money location for Australian organisations to conduct their conferences out of Australia – and even New Zealand.” Dr. Caroline Hong, SCB’s Australian Representative, was excited over the prospects of future business for SCB in the Australia and Singapore market. “Now that the association clients are convinced by the value of Sarawak as a business events destination, I have no doubt the good word will be spread by them back at their respective countries, and in turn more conferences and incentives will take place in Sarawak.” In addition to the FAM trip, SCB has actively fed into the Australia and Singapore market by attending international trade shows, meetings, corporate events and work closely with the international trade media under the banner of “7 Wonders of Borneo” Campaign.
