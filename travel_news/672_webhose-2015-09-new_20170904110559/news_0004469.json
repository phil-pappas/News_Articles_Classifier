There are 10 stand-alone and racetrack casinos in operation, along with the two resort casinos. These facilities collectively employ over 17,000 people and generate an average of $3.7 million per day in tax revenue from slot machine and table games play. The largest portion of that money is used for property tax reduction to all Pennsylvania homeowners with additional tax revenue going to the horse racing industry, economic development projects, fire companies, county fairs, water and sewer projects, the Commonwealth's General Fund, and to local governments that host casinos.\nAdditional information about both the PGCB's regulatory efforts and Pennsylvania's gaming industry can be found at www.gamingcontrolboard.pa.gov .
