The Monterey Convention and Visitors Bureau is even looking at some new ways to market the county to address what some see as a problem and some don’t.\nBusinesses in the Monterey tourism industry are reporting record revenues, and hot spots in Big Sur said this summer was the busiest yet, but all the crowds have some locals saying enough is enough.\n“A calm-down would be very nice, we would appreciate that,” said Carmel Valley resident Toni- Lynn Chetirkin.\nChetirkin likes to run along the water, and she said this year her favourite spot, Point Lobos, has been packed full of cars all summer.\nMore people visiting has meant longer waits at restaurants, fewer parking spaces, and of course traffic.\n“I see so many more people at places like the Lone Cypress, The Lodge, it just seems like there are more people everywhere,” said Pebble Beach resident Tim Lewis, who was having lunch at Point Lobos Thursday.\nLewis said he thinks the increase in people is a good thing for business and a sign the economy is recovering.\n“How to be a good tourist, how to be sensitive to a lot of the habitat that we have that you will see here in Monterey, and all over the county,” said Rick Aldinger with the MCCVB.\nAldinger said it is still very early on, but the talks focused on making sure people who visit the area don’t disrupt wildlife or their habitat. In a county where tourism is the second largest industry earning $2.3 billion a year, Aldinger said more people is always a good thing.\n“When we talk about tourism, that’s how we make our living, and we want to encourage that in any way we can,” he said.\nMCCVB operates on an estimated $7 million budget, much of the money coming from room taxes, and it uses that money to bring more people to the county, something not all locals are in favour of.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T01:53:44.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
