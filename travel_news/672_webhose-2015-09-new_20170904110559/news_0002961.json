She started working for Atkins when she was just 18 through the Year in Industry scheme run by the Engineering Development Trust, which gives students the chance to get experience in STEM companies before university. A scholarship from the Institution of Civil Engineers and Atkins supported her through university. It involved working during university summer holidays for the company, which she then joined full-time two years ago after graduation. A degree can never prepare you with all the technical information you need but it can develop your lateral-thinking, problem-solving, team and communication skills that will make you a success in the workplace. If your university course focuses more on the technical rather than human If your university course focuses more on the technical rather than human and social side of engineering, I think this could surprise you when you start work and see how vital it is to consider the impact of what you are doing. As I worked for Atkins during summers between university, I had ongoing experience of what it’s like to work on real engineering projects, so I’d definitely recommend getting the experience while still at university. As soon as you join Atkins, there’s a focus on your training and development, not just for your first few years but throughout your career too, so you learn more about the company and the industry and can work better with your team. It’s great to have other graduates aroun you to bounce ideas off when you’re facing similar challenges, but more experienced engineers can pass on their knowledge. Working with other disciplines such as mechanical and building services engineers you can better understand projects as a whole. My first project when I was on my year in industry was helping to design sustainable drainage systems, which are alternatives to traditional piped drainage. We were proposing large ponds which would capture and naturally treat runoff rainwater on industrial estates and prevent contaminants which might be harmful to the environment from reaching the surrounding rivers. I was hooked on water engineering from then on. Everyone can relate to the importance of water, whether it’s coming out of your tap or you’re thinking about the millions of people in the world who don’t have safe water to drink. At the moment I’m looking at Thames Water’s clean water network. There are still many pipes put in 80 to 100 years ago that have worked well for a long time but are now suffering from leaks and bursts. The focus of the project is really on the customer –making sure they are aware of planned work in their area and the effects it will have, minimising interruptions to their water supply – and we are always trying to find more innovative and efficient ways of doing this. This in turn helps to keep customers’ bills low, now and in the future. We should be encouraging and facilitating more women to join the profession. Not just because there’s absolutely no reason women can’t be brilliant engineers, but because we are suffering from a real skills shortage in this country There is lots of financial support available for students going into engineering, as the UK really needs more of us! Atkins now offers industry and summer placements for students at university.
