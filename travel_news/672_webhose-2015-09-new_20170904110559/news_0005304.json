Reservations are ticketed, and his fourteen-course tasting menu costs $160 a head.\nInventing a new phrase for his concept restaurant shouldn’t come as a shock to those who have been following his whirlwind career. In March 2014, McGarry was profiled in The New York Times Magazine cover story , in which the writer noted, “McGarry’s eventual plan is to move to New York at seventeen, work at Eleven Madison Park or somewhere like it for a year, maybe a year and a half, and then start work on his restaurant by nineteen.” Timing, it seems for McGarry, really isn’t of the essence. He’s basically going with the flow, taking hold of the opportunities that have presented themselves and provocatively reinventing the way we experience fine dining. “I cook and the rest of it just sort of happens,” he says.\nMany have chastised him for being too young or for making a mockery of the industry—former Louro chef David Santos recently said that when people call McGarry a chef, it offends him. Call him a genius or a joke, the one undeniable thing about McGarry is that he’s passionate about what he does. He’s interned at Michelin-starred restaurants like Alinea and shadowed chefs like Eleven Madison Park’s Daniel Humm . This summer he traveled to Europe to learn from highly respected culinary masters at places like Geranium in Copenhagen and Maaemo in Oslo. For Eureka, McGarry will serve dishes inspired by his experiences abroad, but also his signature plates like peanut Ritz crackers with foie gras terrine and sour cherry compote.\nHe’s charming and quick-witted, with a perfectly swooped mop of hair and slick fashion sense reminiscent of everyone’s high school crush. And that’s just it: On the outside he’s a regular teenager who likes McDonald’s, watching movies, and going to concerts. On the inside, he’s a bright, driven kid who might just be worth more than a few Michelin stars.\nHere, McGarry shares a bit about his work process, his likes and dislikes, and what he does when he’s not plating exquisite food with tiny tweezers. Also, an exclusive recipe from Eureka’s tasting menu.\nOn how he conceptualizes his dishes:\n“It’s really different depending on what it is. Some of the ideas are completely random, some are inspired by other dishes. The other day I was trying to figure out a dish that’s centered around tomatoes. I pretty much cooked tomatoes every way I could for about 22 hours straight, and then I was like, ‘Oh, my God, I just cooked ten pounds of tomatoes, I need a break.’ Then I was on the subway and randomly thought of this idea to make little dumplings with rose petals and a lobster rose-hip broth. I went into the kitchen and tried it out and it worked perfectly the first time. Some of it is really scientific and some of it is just crazy and comes to you in the moment.”\nOn being a picky eater as a little kid:\n“I don’t think I was, my sister was the picky one. We never went out to dinner, and my parents basically cooked the same things all the time, like pasta with red sauce and plain chicken. I got really sick of it eventually. I became obsessed with bagels as a kid, and then soft pretzels because my dad is from Philly. So yeah, I really liked dough as a child.”\nOn pretending to be a chef growing up:\n“My family has a video of me when I was like one or two, trying to cook in my toy wooden kitchen with imaginary ingredients. I would run around in my diaper with a pot, and once, my parents got me a fake refrigerator and I was upset because I didn’t understand why it didn’t work and why it wasn’t cold. It didn’t make sense to me. But yeah, it was always sort of ingrained. We watched a lot of the Cooking Channel together as a family because we weren’t allowed to watch adult TV shows and my parents didn’t want to watch cartoons every day and night; so that was a happy medium.”\nOn his favorite junk food:\n“I love a good McFlurry. I don’t eat them very often, but if I’m around one I will partake.”\nOn ordering takeout:\n“In February we were here in New York City doing the temporary pop-up of Eureka and we ordered in every single night. It’s great, it just shows up, and the best part is that I don’t have to cook it. I’m really pissed, though—I ordered Seamless last night and they said it’d be there in 30 minutes, but then they called and canceled because the restaurant closed.”\nOn cooking for himself:\n“I don’t ever make anything fancy for myself. Since I’ve been in New York I’ve cooked for myself once and it was a kale salad.”\nOn cooking for friends and family:\n“They always ask and I very rarely do. I think I made bread for one of my friend’s birthdays once and they were very appreciative.”\nOn how they keep him grounded:\n“They understand what’s going on, but we don’t talk about it. It’s nice to not talk about it. I understand how ridiculous everything I do is, and I try to surround myself with people who will tell me when I’m being ridiculous. Even my parents, who are so supportive obviously, aren’t the types to say, ‘Oh, son, you’re so perfect, you’re so amazing.’ If I make a dessert or something and it’s not great, my mom will tell me straight up. My family and friends aren’t afraid to tell me the truth, and it’s nice to have people around who aren’t constantly bullshitting you.”\nOn what he would be doing if he wasn’t cooking:\n“Probably some type of art. My dad is a photographer, and I think I would be one, too—though he always told me being a photographer isn’t a real job, but I don’t think, generally, I could do something that’s not artistic. When I was a little kid I played guitar and wanted to be a rock star.”\nOn what he does during downtime:\n“Sleep. I’ve also recently started going to movies alone. I love the idea of turning my phone off and going into this space by myself for a couple of hours. I recently saw The Diary of a Teenage Girl and the Amy Winehouse documentary . I’d love to go to the New York Film Festival, but I don’t think I’ll have time.” On meeting Martha Stewart and the Obamas:\n“Everything I wanted and more. Martha is going to bring me some eggs from her chicken farm to use at Eureka. I don’t think she knows who I am at all, which is great. She talked about her grandchildren who have never eaten sugar, and then I took an Instagram of us in her office. The photo had no filter on it—it was just that perfect. And then when I visited the White House back in 2013, we went to take a photo with the First Family and the president goes, ‘I heard you have a kitchen in your bedroom?’ They had briefed him on me, and there I was talking to the most powerful person in the world who knew all these random details about my life. It was super weird and awesome at the same time.”\nFoie Gras Torchon With Peanut “Ritz Crackers” and Cherry Compote\nFor the torchon:\nIngredients:\nOne 2-lb. lobe foie gras\n1 T kosher salt\n1/2 tsp. pink curing salt\n1 tsp. sugar\n1/2 tsp. white pepper\n3 tsp. Cognac\nDirections:\n1. Bring the foie gras to room temperature to soften.\n2. Separate the main lobes and remove the veins with tweezers and a paring knife. (This is an important step, as you’ll encounter ugly-looking spots and have a harder time cutting the torchon cleanly when the veins are attached to the main piece.) Try to keep the lobe whole, if possible.\n3. In a large bowl, season the foie gras with the salts, sugar, and white pepper.\n4. Coat evenly with the Cognac.\n5. Place in a sous vide cooking bag in an even-layered rectangle and vacuum-seal. Marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours.\n6. Remove the foie gras from the refrigerator and warm in a water bath at 137 degrees Fahrenheit for 5 to 6 minutes or until almost completely liquid.\n7. Pass through a chinois and cool in a bowl over an ice bath while stirring constantly until cold enough to mold.\n8. Place the foie gras mixture in between two sheets of parchment paper and roll to ½-inch thickness. Cool in the refrigerator until completely solid.\n9. Punch with a 1-inch ring mold.\nFor the “Ritz Crackers”:\nIngredients:\n2 cups all-purpose flour\n3 tsp. baking powder\n1 T sugar\n1 T salt\n6 T cold unsalted butter\n7 T peanut butter\n1/3 cup water\nDirections:\n1. Combine all ingredients in a food processor and pulse until a dough is formed.\n2. Roll out to ⅛-inch thickness and cut with a 1½-inch ring mold.\n3. Poke holes in each cracker and indent the sides so it looks like a Ritz cracker.\n4. Bake at 325 degrees Fahrenheit for 8 minutes or until golden brown.\n5. Cool on a cooling rack.\nFor the cherry compote:\nIngredients:\n2 cups pitted and roughly chopped cherries\nChampagne vinegar, to taste\nSalt, to taste\nDirections:\nCook the cherries on low heat until most of the moisture is gone and it resembles a jam. Season with vinegar and salt. Cool.\nTo finish:\nPlace the foie gras torchon on a cracker and top it with a teaspoon of the cherry compote, then top with another cracker. Serve at room temperature.", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/30/magazine/the-chef-at-15.html?_r=0", "http://diningwithflynn.com/", "http://www.eurekanyc.com/", "https://instagram.com/p/7EYDakG-fZ/?taken-by=diningwithflynn", "http://www.grubstreet.com/2015/09/flynn-mcgarry-interview.html"], "published": "2015-09-09T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T22:03:44.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
