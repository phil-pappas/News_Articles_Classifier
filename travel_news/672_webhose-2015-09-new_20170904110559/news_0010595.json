Duluth, GA, September 02, 2015 --( PR.com )-- People from all over the world will get a chance to learn something unique about the City of Duluth in an exciting and new way. The City of Duluth will host their very own Geotour entitled “Caching Duluth” which will be significant in nature as it highlights different areas of Duluth that are historic, playful, educational, and fun.Geocaching is a real-world, outdoor treasure hunting game using GPS-enabled devices. Participants must navigate to a specific set of GPS coordinates and then attempt to find the geocache (container) hidden at that location. Once found, participants must write down what treasure they found by using a logbook or log sheet provided on site. If participants take something, they must leave something of equal or greater value for other participants.Right now, there are over 2 million geocaches in the world and the City of Duluth just added about 35 more. It’s the first Geotour in Gwinnett County and the fourth in the Peach State; making Georgia the largest active Geotour location in the United States.“This is a great way to have a scavenger hunt on a large scale that will hopefully put our City on the map…literally,”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T11:40:59.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
