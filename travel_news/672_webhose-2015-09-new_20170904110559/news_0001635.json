Emma Jones, the company’s founder, knows that connectivity plays a key role in helping a small business to grow and stay agile. Today, as part of an ongoing series of events organised by Canon and the Telegraph, Ms Jones is giving essential connectivity tips to Shanice Parris, the entrepreneur behind London-based start-up Gluten Freedom Club. Drawing on Ms Jones’ skills as a professional chef and her personal experience as the daughter of a coeliac sufferer, Gluten Freedom Club is an online business offering recipes and advice for anyone looking to maintain a healthy but enjoyable gluten-free diet. “It’s based on cooking from scratch, rather than buying products from supermarkets,” says Ms Parris. “When people are first diagnosed, so many things seem off limits. This is a place for people to come to be inspired.” Ms Jones advises that there is a clear strategy to pursue when building a well-connected online enterprise. Experiment with platforms until you find where your customers are “You may wish to follow what we call The three Cs: content, community and commerce,” she says. “The great thing about running an online business is that you can build it and scale it from your back bedroom, drawing people from all over the world – but it takes time to grow your community before you can commercialise it.” At the moment all of Gluten Freedom Club’s content is written by Ms Parris herself. She uses cloud office tools to collaborate with her web developers, who are based outside London. “Everything that needs to go on the site is kept online, so we can share documents and ideas without being anywhere near each other,” she says. Ms Parris has spent months building a community for Gluten Freedom Club, and it will be essential to keep growing this user base as she prepares to launch new products and services. “When people find the site they leave great comments and really engage with the brand,” Ms Parris says. “I just need to get more people to know about it.” Ms Jones asks about the tools that Gluten Freedom Club has been using to attract new visitors. “Start-ups often ask me which social platforms they should choose for their business,” she says. “My advice is to experiment on all of them until you find the one where your customers are.” On the horizon: Ms Parris plans to bring Gluten Freedom Club to YouTube via video demonstrations of her recipes Photo: Copyright Leon Csernohlavek Ms Parris concurs with this approach. After testing several options, she believes Facebook Ads to be the best means for promoting her business. “I’ve found it to be really effective,” she says. “It’s targeted the people I want to reach and grown my audience quickly.” Another way to grow an audience, suggested by Ms Jones, is to create regular social media “events”, built around the use of a specific hashtag. “You could do a gluten-free morning every Wednesday, giving out your recipes with the hashtag #glutenfree,” Ms Jones says. “People searching across Twitter will use the hashtag, which then goes back to you.” Once this routine is established, Ms Parris can use free tools such as TweetReach to measure how many Twitter accounts have been reached. “If you’re pitching to someone, you can use these tech tools that show you’ve got this growing audience.” In the near future, Ms Parris also plans to bring Gluten Freedom Club to YouTube via video demonstrations of her recipes. Ms Jones agrees this will be an excellent way to expand her community and increase brand value. Experiment on all social platforms until you find the one where your customers are Transitioning to this new platform could also unlock additional revenues streams for the business. “You should definitely think about corporate sponsorship,” Ms Jones says. “You’re getting through to an audience that need to eat gluten-free food, and there will be lots of brands that want to connect with that audience – perhaps the big supermarkets, who also see gluten free as a fast-growing market.” Once again, Ms Jones believes that connectivity is the key to developing such partnerships. The ubiquity of social platforms has provided a direct way for small businesses to connect with their larger counterparts. “The best way to get in front of the big corporates is via LinkedIn,” she says. “Search for the managers in your category, and reach out to them.” • Win a state-of-the-art Canon printer for your SME »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T23:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T18:28:53.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
