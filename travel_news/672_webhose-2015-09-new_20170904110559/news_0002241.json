However, this part of London isn’t just about ‘spend, spend and spend again’– although you might be forgiven for thinking so. \nSome Brief Historical Facts \nOriginally named in the medieval period after a bridge over a now underground river, Knightsbridge was for centuries a less than salubrious location. In fact, it became well-known as the hunting spot of thieves and bandits who looked to prey on people coming to and from London. \nHowever, things began to change in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, when in common with other rougher or simply undeveloped hamlets and villages around London’s edge, it began to become gentrified. This happened as a result of the centre of London proper becoming increasingly seen as being unhealthy and over-crowded. \nKnightsbridge Attractions \nOne of the more famous residents that helped give Knightsbridge its reputation for high living was the Duke of Wellington. He lived in Apsley House, which still stands today and has the odd distinction of having the address of 'No 1, London', due to its proximity to the old toll gates that marked the entrance to the city. If you’re visiting Knightsbridge, a tour of this house is a must. The collection of art is amazing, as is the Robert Adam architecture. \nJust across the road from Apsley House you’ll find the Wellington Arch, which commemorates British victories during the Napoleonic Wars. This once stood as the entrance to Buckingham Palace. You can gain entrance inside the arch and it’s well worth the visit. It also lays claim to the largest bronze sculpture in Europe on top. \nIf you’re visiting Knightsbridge for something other than indulging yourself in its many retail outlets, you should also try to see the Diana, Princess of Wales memorial fountain. It’s a beautiful work and a very peaceful, reflective site. \nAnother gem of the area is the Brompton (or London) Oratory, a very large and beautiful 19th century Roman Catholic church built entirely in the Italianate style. The architecture is exceptionally attractive and the church is unusual in that it conducts masses in the original Latin. \nFinally, don’t forget the Victoria and Albert Museum. Affectionately known as the V&A, it houses an incredible collection of design and art works from all over the world. Sometimes slightly overshadowed in reputation by the relatively close by Natural History and Science Museums, the V&A is really 'the people’s museum' and visitors and locals love its displays of ancient costumes, among other things. \nBut never fear, taking in the above attractions doesn’t preclude you from a fabulous shopping experience when you’re visiting Knightsbridge as well. The shops haven’t gone anywhere and they’ll be only too happy to help relieve you of your surplus holiday cash.   from ArticlesFactory.com ABOUT THE AUTHOR \nMatthew Zelinski works for the London Regency Hotel, one of the top hotels in Kensington.
