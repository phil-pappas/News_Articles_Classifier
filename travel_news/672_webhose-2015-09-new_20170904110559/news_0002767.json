Jake Miller was recently named the 2015 Drill Sergeant of the Year. One of the highest honors a soldier in his position can receive, Miller endured an exhaustive four days of physical and mental anguish to beat out the best drill sergeants three other military installations had to offer. \"When I heard I had won I couldn't believe it,\" Miller said. \"I was speechless, and it was all surreal to me. The four-day competition was very intense. They drill you on any and all situations you may encounter as a drill sergeant, from testing your ability to teach and perform any given task. In all, there are over 50 tasks you must complete.\" Just to be able to compete for the title, Miller had to win five boards, or levels. To reach the top echelon, Miller began at the company level. He won his company, battalion, brigade and post levels, meaning he trumped all other competitors at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. As the winner of his installation, he faced the three other drill sergeants who won out at their bases. \"Last Thursday night all the hard work, sweat, studying and training paid off. It was awesome,\" Miller said. \"There were essays, physical components, battle drills and weapons skill tests. It was definitely a long competition, a long week of hard, intense training. Everybody there were all winners. Going up against the top of the top was just unreal.\" While Miller is no stranger to awards, having received an Army Commendation Medal with Valor, the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, the Iraq Campaign Medal, and the Combat Action Badge during his two deployments in Iraq, his current distinction is the most prestigious. While the winner was announced Sept. 10, the competition began more than a year ago. Throughout the entire competition, Miller was also working toward completing his bachelor's degree in criminal justice. \"It has been hard to manage with my drill sergeant duty, because you are constantly on duty and are almost never at home. After trying to fit in that, family time and school, I have learned a lot about managing time through this. It is just a part of me now,\" Miller said. \"My family has been very supportive of this. It would have been almost impossible without them. My boys were really excited when I won, and my entire family came to the ceremony at Fort Jackson in South Carolina.\" On Thursday, Sept. 17, Miller learned he had been selected for a promotion. Even with the announcement that he will become sergeant first class, it could be anywhere from a month to a year before it happens. \"It is tough to get promoted in the Army anymore, so you have to take those steps to separate yourself from other individuals. I first enlisted because I wanted to serve my country, and there are great benefits for my family. It just seemed like the right thing to do,\" Miller said. \"I love my job and definitely want to keep going. I love serving my country. This has been a great ride, and I hope it continues for a long time.\" By Matthew Dutton", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T06:36:11.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
