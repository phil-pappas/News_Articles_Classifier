According to UK Airport Car Parks, staying in the UK is expensive.\nThe UK tourism industry is trying to convince people to stay in the UK for their family holiday. However, according to Manchester Car Parking Experts UK Airport Car Parks, staying in the UK for a holiday for a family of four is more expensive than going abroad.\nThe Manchester Airport Car Parking expert who helps people find low-cost parking at Airports around the UK, says families can get better value for money spending a week in Spain than staying in the UK. The car parking company compared different holidays to holidays in the UK and found if a family of four went to Bognor Regis in September, it would cost them £860 more than going to Majorca.\nThe Manchester Car Parking company ( http://www.ukairportcarparks.co.uk/car-parking/manchester ) took into account the cost of food, drink and the cost of the accommodation.\nChris Fryer from UK Airport Car Parks said: “It did not surprise me when we checked holidays abroad compared to the UK that families would save money by going abroad.”\nThe results, which can be found at http://www.ukairportcarparks.co.uk/blog/holiday-costs-uk-vs-abroad/ show the UK tourism industry has a serious problem. One of the biggest problems in the UK is holiday parks and camps charging too much for accommodation when they make money on site according to the travel experts. Although the news that abroad is much cheaper than the UK for a family, it will not be good news for the UK tourism industry that are trying to convince people to spend their money in the UK.\nUK Airport Car Parks who helps people save money on their airport car parking requirements by checking all the available prices and showing the best deals believe the UK tourism industry needs to take action. The car parking company believes more should be done to offer holidaymakers in the UK value for money.\nTo learn more about saving money on Airport car parking at Manchester Airport, Gatwick Airport, and other airports, please visit http://www.ukairportcarparks.co.uk/car-parking/manchester or to learn the secrets in finding cheap easyJet flights, please visit http://www.ukairportcarparks.co.uk/blog/how-to-find-cheap-easyjet-flights-for-your-holiday\nAbout Ukairportcarparks.co.uk\nUkairportcarparks.co.uk provides holidaymakers with a trusted and affordable airport parking, airport hotel and airport lounge solution.\nMedia Contact:\nUK Airport Car Parks\nYork, YO1 9RA\n0774 059 4552\nEmail: This email address is being protected from spambots.
