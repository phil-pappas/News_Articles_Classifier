So imagine my smug levels when, in 2011 at 32 with three children and a husband, we made the family decision to relocate from north London to the South Hams. Having sorted two jobs, schools and nurseries in a matter of weeks, my husband Jon set off with our eldest Eddie, 7, who was starting school in a couple of days; I was to follow him down 48 hours later with our other two children Sam, 3 and Annie, 11 months. I felt positively giddy at the thought of reaching our newly acquired 17th-century farmhouse Setting off for a new life in the country two days later, I felt positively giddy at the thought of reaching our newly acquired 17th-century farmhouse where Jon assured me fizz was chilling. The sat-nav ETA said we would be there by 8pm. Approaching junction 20 of the M5 I only had 105 miles to go before a new life for all when I started feeling a wobble in the steering. What part of my psyche thought it was a good idea to accelerate I will never know, but what happened next is the closest I have come to seeing my life flash before my eyes. What I thought was gravel in the road turned out to be my back offside tyre coming away from the wheel seconds before it blew out, sending the car careering across three lanes of traffic in the dark on a rainy January evening. Shaking like a leaf and checking we were all still intact, I grabbed the kids from the car Shaking like a leaf and checking we were all still intact, I grabbed the kids from the car, clambered up on to a grass verge in the rain and called for rescue. Minutes later, a police car turned up to give two cold, crying children warmth in the back of their car. Having been told I was lucky we had not rolled, I bit my lip hard to stop the tears until the flatbed truck arrived and winched our broken vehicle on. Fast forward four hours, two screaming children, 12 chocolate digestives and eight nails bitten, I saw the warming lights of our beautiful farm. I tried to leave the disasters in the truck, to savour the moment I set foot into my new life Opening the passenger door, I tried to leave the disasters in the truck and took a deep breath, telling myself to savour the moment I set foot into my new life. One massive squelch later and my brand-new Ugg boots were brimming with mud mixed with agricultural and farm run-off. I’m not one to believe in signs from above but that evening I started to wonder whether someone or something did not want me to relocate. With bad luck coming in threes, when I got into our new farmhouse, I flicked on the lights and short-circuited the whole house.
