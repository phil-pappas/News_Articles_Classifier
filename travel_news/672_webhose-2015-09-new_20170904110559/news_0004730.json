The app also offers the ability to view all of your children's assigned routes, on one screen including a scheduled home arrival time. To ensure the safety and privacy of each student the Tracker requires parents and guardians to create a password-protected account along with authenticating their child's school ID in order to access the bus location for their route.\n\"We designed Durham Bus Tracker with safety and security in mind, and we are pleased to have built a solution that meets these requirements while also responding to our customer's needs for information,\" said David A. Duke , CEO of National Express LLC, the parent company of Durham School Services. \"The Durham Bus Tracker has been piloted in several of our locations and both parents and school district administrators have found this to be a very valuable and helpful tool.\"\nThe Durham Bus Tracker, which is provided at no additional cost to the school district, parent or guardian, can be downloaded from the Apple App Store, Google Play Store or it can be viewed on a web browser.\nFor more information regarding this app please visit www.durhamschoolservices.com/durhambustracker .\nAbout our company\nDurham School Services, Stock Transportation, Petermann Bus and National Express Transit Corporation, make up National Express, headquartered in Warrenville, Ill.
