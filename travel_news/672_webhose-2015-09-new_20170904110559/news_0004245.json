Christchurch based Dalman Architecture undertook the architectural and interior design elements. \nBreakFree on Cashel will set a benchmark for the economy brand’s future CBD hotels said Michael Moret-Lalli, Director of Acquisitions for the hotel’s Australian based management company, Mantra Group: \n“The hotel provides a glimpse of the future urban hotel design incorporating the important elements that make a great hotel – a clever use of space; comfortable quality beds; and seamless social spaces that integrate lifestyle and technology. \nGuests are welcomed with modern design elements as soon as they enter the spacious lobby from Cashel Street that serves as a combined reception, lounge, bar and restaurant. The hub of the hotel, it’s a space where guests can connect with colleagues and friends via free wi-fi*. \nThe hotel incorporates some of the latest smart technology including high-definition and interactive digital entertainment systems enabling guests to mirror their smart phone on the TV screen via the Smartview App for social media interaction as well as music and videos through iTunes, YouTube or Netflix. Complimentary wireless key boards are available for loan from reception. \nHotel facilities include unique ‘pod style rooms’ as well as the addition of high quality traditional hotel rooms located on the top floor executive level. There is a contemporary interactive Café/Restaurant and Bar; breakfast room, guest lounge; conference room catering for up to 80 people and 2 boardroom style meeting spaces with capacity for 20 people; 24-hour reception; internet kiosk; guest laundry and onsite parking. \nBuoyed by the recent announcement that China Southern Airlines will commence direct flights from Guangzhou to Christchurch in December and the growing infrastructure around the city, Breakfree on Cashel General Manager Graeme Back said: \n\"BreakFree on Cashel adds vital room numbers to Christchurch's accommodation offering for both the leisure and business market. It's also boosted the local job market along the way, now employing 80 staff in the hotel.” \nMantra Group also manages the award-winning Peppers Clearwater Resort situated 7 km from the centre of Christchurch. BreakFree on Cashel brings the total number of Mantra Group hotels in New Zealand to 11 but this is the very first traditional hotel concept under the BreakFree brand. The Group also manages BreakFree on the Point and BreakFree The Waterfront both in Queenstown as serviced apartment properties.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T05:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:45:15.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
