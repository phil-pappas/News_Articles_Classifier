And more and more young desk jockeys are allowing their itchy feet to be lured into jetting off for long globetrotting stints, often taking up travel blogging to share their stories and make a little cash.\nYou probably know of, or are even mates with, at least one of them.\nIt’s all well and good when you’re actively contributing to this happy torrent of sunshine, adventure and self-discovery.\nGreen with envy (Frame content direct link: http://instagram.com/p/6lBT5ULqGP/embed .)\nBut being a jealous onlooker is another story. Your cornflakes begin to taste like cardboard, your commute begins to feel like a scene from The Hunger Games and you start to despise your computer screen, not only for being the only form of light your face is basking in, but also for fuelling your envy.\nOf course, you might take the occasional two-week trip or weekend away. But in a sense, these serve as teasers to the glossy life you could be living, but aren’t, and won’t.\nNow, one couple has thankfully cut through the crap (literally) to serve up an honest picture of what life as a nomad is really like.\nAnd as it turns out, the reality is not as pretty as what’s presented.\nWhere you'd rather be (Frame content direct link: http://instagram.com/p/5je8C2rqAH/embed .)\nChanel Cartell and Stevo Dirnberger, who together manage their How Far From Home travel blog , left their advertising jobs in Johannesburg, South Africa, in March to explore the world.\nAs of Monday they had journeyed 25,071km and are currently in Athens, Greece.\nAnd on Sunday, they made a refreshing confession : months of travel is not all it’s cracked up to be.\nMade it to Athens (Frame content direct link: http://instagram.com/p/7FqPsKrqJw/embed .)\nLow on cash and with no more income to count on, they have toiled away cleaning toilets, scooping dog and cow poo and shovelling rocks in exchange for free food and accommodation.\n“After being gone exactly 6 months, I feel it necessary we share the uglier side of our trip. Browsing through our blog posts and Instagram feed , it seems like we’re having the time of our lives. And don’t get me wrong — we are,” Cartell wrote.\nWOULD YOU SCRUB TOILETS TO FUND YOUR TRAVELS? Tell us below.\n“But it’s not all ice-creams in the sun and pretty landscapes. N . So far, I think we’ve tallied 135 toilets scrubbed, 250 kilos of cow dung spread, 2 tons of rocks shovelled, 60 metres of pathway laid, 57 beds made, and I cannot even remember how many wine glasses we’ve polished.”\nYoga bliss (Frame content direct link: http://instagram.com/p/6pyWDzLqLx/embed .)\nCartell describes the unglamorous gigs, which are arranged using WorkAway, as “painstakingly hard and dirty work”.\nAnd not only are the pair getting uncomfortably close to faeces, they’re also running on little sleep and poor nutrition.\n“I am not at my fittest, slimmest or physically healthiest. We eat jam on crackers most days, get roughly 5hrs of sleep per night, and lug our extremely heavy bags through cobbled streets at 1am, trying to find our accommodation (because bus fares are not part of the budget, obviously),” Cartell wrote.\nNot so glamorous (Frame content direct link: http://instagram.com/p/3qNPzirqPV/embed .)\nShe also recalls the time in Norway when, after having to buy beer and lollies for local friends they were crashing with, they only had just enough money to buy dental floss. A ‘first world problem’ that may be, but it’s certainly not an issue you’d expect when browsing their social media feeds.\nCartell does however go on to explain that while a nomadic lifestyle is not for the faint-hearted, “there’s nothing quite like ... toilet scrubbing to teach you about humility, life and the importance of living each day as if it were your last.”\nTwitter: @sopphie\nsophie.aubrey@news.com.au\nWhere You'll Travel in 2015 3:15 Play video\nCroatia, Turkey and South America are heating up as vacation destinations, says HomeAway chief Brian Sharples.
