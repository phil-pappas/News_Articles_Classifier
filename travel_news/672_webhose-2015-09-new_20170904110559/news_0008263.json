But it ain't the \"cool teen hangout\" promised on the website. \nThis is one of the more obvious examples of parents taking their kids to the wrong place, at the wrong time and not only can it ruin the experience, it's also a terrible waste of money. The perfect family holiday can be summed up in one word: timing. What's right for toddlers is oh-so-wrong for teens. \nThis is the definitive guide to the best destinations for every age: babies, toddlers, young kids, tweens, teens and young adults. \nFrom Marysville to Morocco, we reveal where to go, what to do, and things to bring. \nBABIES AND TODDLERS Ad Feedback \nChildren have it made at Nanuku Resort & Spa, Fiji. \nYes, Samoa and the Cook Islands are divine, but the childcare isn't as good. Most of the Fijian resorts have excellent kids' clubs, which take children as young as three. You have to book a babysitter for younger kids, but the cost is minimal. I've watched the most feral toddlers be tamed by the transcendental Fijians. \nWhat to do: Relax by the pool and read a book, knowing your little ones are in safe hands. \nThings to bring: Swim nappies, steriliser, and glass bottle for storing cool boiled water. Cots, strollers and toys are supplied by the resorts. \nWhere to stay: Nanuku Resort & Spa ( nanukufiji.com ); from around $1202 a night, all inclusive. Sheraton Fiji Resort, Denarau ( sheratonfiji.com ); from around $412 a night. \nTHAILAND \nAdmittedly, the long flight can be challenging if your child is aged between 18 months and two-and-a-half-years. (This is the toughest time to fly, because all they want to do is tear up and down the aisles.) But it's worth it, if you prefer Asia to the Pacific. \nWhat to do: Splash in the shallows of the Andaman Sea, enjoy the colour and movement of the street stalls, or go to Khao Kheow Open Zoo. \nThings to Bring: Baby formula (although you can get it at most major resorts and shops) and inflatable rings for the pools. You can rent anything else you need through thailandbabyrentals.com . \nWhere to stay: Holiday Inn Mai Khao; phuketmaikhaobeach.holidayinnresorts.com ; from $221 a night. Sunwing Resort & Spa, Bangtao Beach; sunwingphuket.com ; from $201 a night. \nQUEENSLAND \nHamilton Island, Palm Cove and Port Douglas are all designed with young families in mind, with accommodation within walking distance to warm, gentle waters. Try to go outside of summer, so it's not too hot. \nWhat to Do: The Clownfish Club on Hamilton takes kids from six weeks of age. The Cairns Zoo and Skyrail are worth a visit, if you stay in Palm Cove. Then, there's the glorious Port Douglas Coastal Walk. \nThings to bring: A Baby Bjorn or hiking backpack, and a stinger suit if you plan to go between November and May. \nWhere to Stay: Palm Cove by Lancemore l ancemore.com.au ; from A$744 (NZ$835) a night for a two-bedroom suite. Hamilton Island; hamiltonisland.com.au ; from A$440 a night. \nYOUNG CHILDREN (4-8 years) \nDISNEYLAND \nThis is the best age to introduce kids to the Disney franchise: young enough to swept away by the magic of the Mouse; old enough to walk on their own two feet. At the younger end, they won't be tall enough to go on all the rides, but Fantasyland and Mickey's Toontown cater specifically to this age group. \nWhat to Do: Spend two-to-four days at the Happiest Place on Earth. \nThings to Bring: A mobile phone for photos, small snacks, and a refillable water bottle. There's no need to lug a lot around. \nWhere to Stay: Choose any of the Disney hotels. The rooms are designed for families with young kids, and they're close to the action. Disneyland Hotel, Anaheim disneyland.disney.go.com . From $822/night. \nSheraton Deva, New Caledonia. \nNEW CALEDONIA \nThis special collectivity of France is great for those who are learning a second language. Most of the kids' clubs teach French. Or stay with a local family through Bedycasa or New Caledonia Voyages, for an immersive experience. \nWhat to do: French lessons, swimming, snorkelling, dining on cheese from Roquefort and red wine from Bordeaux. \nThings to bring: A French-English dictionary, snorkelling sets, and clip-on koala toys to give to local kids. \nWhere to stay: Sheraton Deva sheratonnewcaledoniadeva.com From around $253/night. \nSUNSHINE COAST \nActive kids will love this place, with its vast, golden beaches and quirky theme parks. It's an hour-and-a-half drive from Brisbane, or you can fly into the airport at Marcoola. \nWhat to do: Visit the Ginger Factory, Big Pineapple, Australia Zoo, Ettamogah Hotel and Table Manners restaurant; go fishing, surfing, and swimming. \nThings to bring: Swimmers, and a relaxed attitude. \nWhere to stay: Novotel Twin Waters has a circus school and giant water trampoline. novoteltwinwatersresort.com.au . From A$153/night. \nMALDIVES \nThis 800m by 250m island of Kani is exclusively home to Club Med. \nThis archipelago in the Indian Ocean has a reputation as being a couples' retreat, but it's terrific for families. Find an all-inclusive resort with activities everyone will love. \nWhat to do: Laze on brilliant white beaches as the kids splash in turquoise waters. Try snorkelling, sailing, or playing sport on the beach. \nThings to bring: A soccer ball for the beach. However, at the resorts, most of the beach toys, and sporting equipment, are included. \nWhere to stay: Club Med Kani clubmed.ca . From $1085 a night for a family, all inclusive. \nTWEENS \nHAWAII \nThe kids' clubs in Hawaii only take ages five to 12.

From $397 a night. \nNORFOLK ISLAND \nEmily Bay, a curve of golden sand sheltered by a reef and the temperature of a warm pool, is great for swimming and snorkelling. \nAustralia's convict history is – literally – a bloody good topic for kids in this age group. A trip to Norfolk Island brings history to life. \nWhat to do: Horse-riding, snorkelling at Emily Bay, watching the Sound & Light show (a spooky, night-time re-enactment), and Fletcher's Mutiny Cyclorama. \nThings to bring: History books, or the itravelNORFOLK app. \nWhere to Stay: Tintoela is ideal for multigenerational​ travellers. norfolkislaccommodation.com .

Here are the top five: \nNorfolk Island: Older travellers will find the history fascinating. This has also become a foodie destination, with paddock-to-plate restaurants aplenty. Perhaps nan and pop can look after the kids one night, so mum and dad can go out for dinner? There are plenty of homesteads, which sleep up 14 people. norfolkisland.com.au . \nNew York: The boutique Pod Hotels are ideal for an extended family: everyone has their own space. Young adults will love the clubs and sporting events; the rest of the family, the performing arts, galleries and museums. And the shopping? Well, that's good for everyone. nycgo.com . \nUluru: The Sounds of Silence dinner, Harley sunset tour, Indigenous dance performances, dot painting, and spear and boomerang-throwing, classes, are appropriate for all ages. Different types of accommodation are within the precinct, so you can stay wherever suits you, and meet up for meals. travelnt.com . \nHawaii: It's easy to get around, with regular trolleys and buses in Waikiki. For baby boomers, it's a flashback to the swingin' '60s. Younger travellers will love the surfing, snorkelling and shopping. There's a wide variety of accommodation options within walking distance of the strip. gohawaii.com.au . \nGold Coast: The surf clubs and RSLs clubs are always good for a cheap family meal. If you stay at Broadbeach, Jupiters Casino, Pacific Fair Shopping Centre and the beach are close by. Everyone, whatever their age, has childhood memories of the \"Goldie\". visitgoldcoast.com . \nCOMBOS FROM HELL \nToddler+newborn: This is perhaps, the most exhausting parenting phase: you put one down to sleep and the other one wakes up. That's why you need to go somewhere with good childcare. \nTeen+tween: The former wants space and independence; the latter craves his/her attention. Best to let teenagers wander off to do their own thing. The tween will enjoy quality time with the parents. \nYoung adult+teen: You guessed it. The adult can go to nightclubs; the under-18 wants to tag along. Make sure the teenager gets plenty of other holiday privileges to make up for this affront, like unlimited access to electronic devices and fast food. \nToddler+toddler: I'm tempted to say, \"Just don't travel with them, at this age!\" You'll need to be sedated, to survive a long flight/drive. Choose a resort with affordable quality childcare, so you don't lose your mind. \nTeen+teen: This is OK if they get on well. You can send them off on an adventure, while you relax. However, if they're both going through the grunting stage, nothing will satisfy them.
