The “snowed-under” phenomenon was so all-pervasive that many people were ashamed to take a vacation, and when vacations were taken they were usually for long weekends. This “work-until-you-drop” mentality impacted tourism in any number of ways. For example, many women went through an internal battle between their desire to stay home with their young children and their desire, or need to work. The tourism industry gave many of those women who chose to work an opportunity to enter into the workforce not merely at entry-level positions but as major administrators.\nLocations reacted to the work-until-you drop mentality by offering shorter and more intense travel experiences, the weekend vacation package was born, and hotels and places of lodging understood that businesspeople and busy executives wanted Internet service and free emails as a means of staying in touch, even when they were away. These never-ending workload mentalities are beginning to change and with the change back to the shorter workweek and more free time new potentials returning to the leisure industry.\nHere are some of the newest trends in work time management and how tourism professionals can take advantage of the growth of leisure.\n– Offer vacations and holidays that really allow people to get away from their stressful daily lives.\n– Think rural even if your destination is urban.\n– Office productivity may be tied to leisure time.\n– Make exercise fun and less stressful.\n– Be creative and make family time will matter more than ever.\n– Be prepared for fewer women with young children in the work force or for changing workforce demographics.\n– Provide people with outlets for hobbies.\n– Offer restful alternatives.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T18:07:54.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
