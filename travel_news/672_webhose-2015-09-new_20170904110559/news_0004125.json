Where possible, the original structures have been retained and strengthened to continue to carry London’s oldest railway.\nThe Bermondsey Dive Under, which will be completed in 2017, is part of the Government-sponsored Thameslink Programme, revolutionising north-south travel through London.\nSource:-Network Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T15:30:57.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
