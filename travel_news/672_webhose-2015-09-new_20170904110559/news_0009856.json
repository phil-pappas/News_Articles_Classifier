The special northern lights livery, displayed on the Boeing 757 named Hekla Aurora, will be seen illuminating the skies over Florida as it prepares for the first flight from MCO in nearly 10 years.\nBeginning tomorrow, September 5, 2015, Icelandair will resume seasonal, non-stop service from Orlando International Airport to Iceland, with connections to more than 20 destinations in Europe.

Seasonal flights from MCO will give locals the opportunity to explore the world and Europeans the chance to enjoy the many family-friendly sites in Orlando and central Florida,” said Birkir Holm Gudnason, CEO, Icelandair.\nIcelandair provided service from their longtime gateway of Orlando International (MCO) before moving to Orlando Sanford International (SFB) in 2006. Now, with their return to MCO, passengers will gain improved access to Icelandair’s schedule including increased flights, more destinations and more gateways.\n“We are very pleased with Icelandair’s service which offers convenient access to Central Florida and a variety of connection options available by more than 70 non-stop destinations from Orlando International Airport for its customers,” said Frank Kruppenbacher, Chairman of the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority. “It is exciting to re-establish our long relationship with Icelandair and the access benefits from its Keflavik hub provided to our passengers to explore interesting locations in Scandinavia, United Kingdom and Continental Europe.”\nIcelandair offers service to Iceland from Boston, Chicago-ORD, Denver, Edmonton, New York-JFK, Newark, Seattle, Toronto, and Washington, D.C.; and seasonal service from Anchorage, Halifax, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Montreal, Orlando, Portland, OR, and Vancouver, BC.
