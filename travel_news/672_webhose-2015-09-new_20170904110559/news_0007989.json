Rory O'Sullivan \nCelebrity chef Al Brown has organised an extravagant trip featuring culinary experiences in New York, Paris and London while also taking in the semi-finals, bronze final and the final of the Rugby World Cup. \nThere will be private drinks at the Petrus residence overlooking the Champs-Elysees and behind the scenes access to some of New York and London's most sought after eateries. \nIt will be a culinary tour with a side of rugby - not a rugby tour with a side of food, and Brown says the group will drop into the games and then get away from the hype. \n\"Because of the nature of this tournament, we have been knocked out of the quarter finals before...and your whole world comes crashing down on you because that was your trip. Heaven forbid if the ABs get knocked out in the quarters or the semis, we've still got this amazing itinerary of things to do.\" \nOf course, Brown doesn't really believe for a moment that his favourite men in black won't deliver the trophy. This will be the third World Cup that he has been to, and when it comes to the All Blacks he admits to getting a bit light-headed. \nIt's Ma'a Nonu in particular who gets Brown's pulse racing but really he loves them all. \"My heart beats whenever there's an All Black anywhere, it goes up about 20 notches. A lot of them love to go to Best Ugly (Brown's bagel workshop in Auckland's centre) and carbo-load. I'm like any other Kiwi fan, I get a dry throat and get all giddy around them.\" \nThe Off the Bench tour starts in New York, heads to London, Paris, a French village and then back to London for the finals. Brown isn't divulging too many of the specifics from the trip as he wants his clients to be surprised. \"We want it to sort of unravel along the way. There's a certain amount of trust because its $28,000 a ticket...it's a big number there's no question about that but we think the value proposition is three or four times that...It's off the beaten track that's the beauty of it.\" \nBrown has already done a little test run of the itinerary - just to be sure things were up to scratch. \"It was so much fun but we came back just absolutely exhausted. We were having one night with each contact and because I've looked after them here in New Zealand they wanted to really roll out the red carpet every day and every night.\" Ad Feedback \nA few little tweaks to the itinerary will hopefully leave the travellers maybe a little less overwhelmed. \"Even the word tour, we don't like the word tour. It's kind of like a gathering that's moving around. The people that have come on board, if they don't want to, they don't have to be on the bus at 7am...but we have a feeling that once we start in New York they will want to do everything.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T06:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T20:23:22.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
