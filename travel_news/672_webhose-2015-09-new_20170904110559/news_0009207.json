It defies the descriptive clichés, photographs and chatter, and supersedes all that I have heard. I peer down on Marlon Brando’s dream. Literally. The famed private island the reclusive actor discovered in the ’60s while filming Mutiny on the Bounty is a short runway away, and I’m astounded by its ethereal grace.\nThere lies Tetiaroa and its uninhabited ring of emerald islets cushioned by countless shades of blue atop a living reef, a quiet allegory of the past, the present and, I learn, a curious future. Brando, who eschewed Mulholland Drive for this Polynesian paradise and way of life, might have been ahead of his time in his vision to conserve the 12 motus that have been part of Tahitian lore for more than 4,000 years.\nThe past Brando was clearly in his element settling here with his then-leading lady on and off the screen, Tarita Teriipia. Historically, Tetiaroa was a retreat for Tahitian high chiefs. It was a sanctuary, a place for peace talks and a utopia for frivolity. Young prince Ma’ohis held archery competitions, and ravishing, raven-haired vahines were fattened up with breadfruit pudding and plied with skin-lightening elixirs made from beach pea vines. Marae temples that still exist on the islets today are remnants of what the Tahitians considered sacred sites.\nBrando, transformed by the Tahitian culture, was vocal about his commitment to the atoll.\n“If I have my way,” he said, “Tetiaroa will remain forever a place that reminds Tahitians of what they are and what they were centuries ago.”\nThe dream Brando not only wanted Tetiaroa’s future to echo its past; he insisted it could be a self-sustaining atoll and a model to the rest of the planet for research, education and conservation. In 1999, he shared this vision with friend and Tahiti hotelier Richard Bailey, and together they conceived the world’s first post-carbon resort. A decade after the actor’s death, Tetiaroa has indeed become a luxury playground for the well-heeled, but more true to Brando’s dream, precedent-setting innovative technology has achieved both a negligible carbon footprint and created a “university of the sea” with a wealth of opportunities for the scientific community.\nPlayground for the posh The Brando epitomizes the concept of private paradise. Camouflaged by rich foliage, 35 sea-facing villas with floor-to-ceiling windows open to decks with outdoor dining areas and infinity plunge pools that look out onto pristine white sand beaches that feel undiscovered. All the typical high-end comforts can be found inside, with a pleasing blend of contemporary and Polynesian design.\nWhat is atypical, however, is the easy all-inclusive nature of your stay. French-inspired cuisine, activities and daily spa treatments are all part of being a Brando guest, and I was not one to miss a signature treatment in the colossal birds’ nests secluded within the island’s tropical forest.\nNot many signs of Brando’s past days, here; but if you saddle up to Bob’s Bar, you’ll feel the nostalgia in the re-creation of the old thatched-roof watering hole named for Brando’s longtime friend. A highly recommended cocktail, the Dirty Old Bob, includes Jack Daniel’s, pineapple juice, lime, Angostura bitters and an ounce of the Brando’s own local honey.\nLuxury unplugged “Marlon felt technology was the solution to many of the Earth’s problems,” Bailey said. “We’re trying to walk the walk here.”\nWalking the walk means going beyond being the eco-buzzword of the moment. It seems everyone with celebrity cachet is cashing in on eco-tourism. Leonardo DiCaprio, now known to be developing his own sustainable island off Belize, was recently nosing around his fellow actor’s namesake and seemingly impressed by what he saw.\n“DiCaprio and his friends took about 14 hours of film here,” Bailey mused. “He had better not be stealing all my ideas.”\nIndeed, sustainability lip service is nowhere in sight once you see the colossal operation behind the serenity of the pandanus and coconut trees that blend seamlessly with the resort. Tetiaroa is in contention for becoming the first campus resort in the world to obtain LEED Platinum certification.\nThe Brando is powered by coconut biofuel and 2,500 solar panels. Cutting-edge flow batteries are used to store solar energy power. Wastewater is filtered and used for irrigation. The resort, of course, recycles, composts and has its own garden and honey farm. Transportation is by bicycle or sun-powered electric club carts.\nAll impressive, but overshadowed when I am shown where the air conditioning comes from: It’s called the SWAC — an idea generated by Brando himself — short for Sea Water Air Conditioning. Guests are cooled by ocean depths of almost a mile using only a pump and no electricity. What’s even more fascinating is that while guests are staying cool, scientists in the Ecostation on the other side of the beach are using the same system for groundbreaking and globally significant studies.\nUniversity of the sea This Ecostation is perhaps what will be the most poignant contribution to Brando’s legacy. It serves as the heart of the nonprofit Tetiaroa Society, formed to support conservation of the coral atoll; be a provider of education for the preservation of Polynesian culture, history and way of life; and function as a hub for global scientific research.\nWorld-class scientists are addressing ocean acidification, turtle and bird preservation, mosquito control and biocoding in this complex tropical ecosystem. Those funding these studies are diverse, ranging from individual donors to the cosmetic company Biotherm, supporting an initiative to replenish marine life. Thanks to the Sea Water Air Conditioning system, the Ecostation offers an opportunity unique among the world’s labs — access to a treasure of species over a mile deep.\nWhen asked what Marlon Brando would make of his beloved Tetiaroa today, his friend and partner Bailey said: “He wouldn’t have agreed to use his name, but would have understood the choice. He’d probably laugh and say he was just joking about the whole thing. But deep down, I think he’d be very pleased.”\nShannon Melnyk is a freelance writer in Canada.\nWhen you go Air: Air Tahiti Nui and Air France offer nonstop service to Papeete, Tahiti, from Los Angeles International Airport.
