Rediscovering Daring Voyages into the Unknown’. \nHer book tells the gripping stories of three early female explorers who travelled to remote regions of the world in the 18th and 19th centuries, and how she retraced their intrepid journeys. \nWTM London, Portfolio Conference Manager, Charlotte Sutton said: “I am delighted that so many dynamic and inspiring women have agreed to give up their time during World Travel Market London to share their expertise. \n“The level of debate and advice during last year’s inaugural programme was second-to-none so I am sure this year will build on those strong foundations. \n“I urge women in the travel industry to attend to gain motivating advice and practical tips to develop their own businesses and career paths.” \nWTM Women in Travel meet-up at World Travel Market London 2015 (Tuesday 3 November). \nMentoring clinics \nSouth Gallery 17 (1.30pm-2pm; 3pm-3.30pm) \nMentors will be panellists and other travel professionals including Debbie Hindle, Managing Director at Four BGB, and Dr Caroline Scarles, School of Hospitality and Tourism Management, University of Surrey.
