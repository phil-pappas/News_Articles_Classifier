There are many others.\nThreats from the Rugby League Players Association about player welfare and possible industrial action are legitimate.\nComplaints that the NRL is not taking the RLPA seriously ring true, if for no other reason than the clubs have the same complaint, the fans too, in fact most of the game’s major stakeholders.\nMelbourne recently played Newcastle on Monday night football. They then played North Queensland five days later on a Saturday night. Five days after that they played Brisbane on the Thursday night.\nThree games in 11 days.\nAt some point, that toll is going to get them.\nCowboys' co-captain Matt Scott backs Johnathan Thurston 0:57 NRL: North Queensland Cowboys' co-captain Matt Scott throws his support behind Johnathan Thurston, who is taking on the NRL over player welfare.\nSeptember 10th 2015 a day ago /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/NRL/ As it is getting them all.\nIt leaves a very simple question for the game to ask itself: why wouldn’t we want all those players available for the finals?\nIf the answer is as simple as it should be, why the go-slow on renegotiating the Collective Bargaining Agreement with the players?\nIt seems a no-brainer.\nWhat’s difficult to understand is the NRL has made great strides in recent years to improve player safety and welfare.\nThe shoulder charge was banned and upgraded. The concussion rule was introduced and improved.\nMost of it was to safeguard headquarters against lawsuits, as much as there was a genuine concern for the players, yet for all the debate in Fan Land they were necessary for the game.\nWear and tear is a separate issue, equally as important but not nearly the priority, it seems, to headquarters.\nIt should be.\nNothing sells the game like star power and too many of our best are unavailable because they are still making their way out of the casualty ward.\nAnd while it is true nobody can anticipate injury, it is equally true that injury generally occurs through undertraining or overtraining and there is a strong chance most NRL teams are pushing it harder than most.\nNothing positive can be said for five-day turnarounds and shortened off-seasons where the coaches have the players flogging themselves through hard hot summers despite all the modern science.\nBilly Slater is out for the season with a shoulder injury. Photo Michael Ross Importantly, the players are not making a cash grab here as they strive to renegotiate their CBA.\nThe current CBA was signed for five years but with an agreement, as a “show of good faith”, to be renegotiated after three years after the RLPA believed the NRL vastly undervalued the game — which latest figures support.\nNegotiations were supposed to begin in March. Here it is September and there has been little movement.\nRLPA president Clint Newton has more meetings with Dave Smith planned next week.\nIt has to get sorted.\nOn Friday Broncos coach Wayne Bennett weighed in, telling the players to “pull their heads in” as their talk threatens to overshadow the finals series.\n“I don’t think they have put much thought in to be honest with you,” he said.\n“They didn’t want to deliberately damage the finals but that’s what they are doing, I hope they pull their heads in and let us enjoy this month of football.\n“It’s all about the fans, they want to read what they do on the footy field, they don’t want to read about disputes off the field.”\nBennett has said a lot of clever things over the years, but this isn’t one of them.\nThe players have been trying to negotiate since March.\nThey see their opportunity window fading by a bullish NRL refusing to take them seriously and so they are demanding to be respected.\nSomething even the coach has always championed.\nA GOOD WEEK FOR\nDANIEL Vidot now plans to make it as a wrestler in the WWE and he will fit right in. Playing at the Dragons, Vidot was late to training one day and explained he overslept. He was tired, he said. He was then informed he was spotted at a karaoke bar singing a mean “New York, New York” at 2am. That’s because he couldn’t sleep, he said, and so he thought he’d go and sing to make himself tired. Looks like it worked. And looks like he will be perfect for the WWE.\nDaniel Vidot is hoping to join the WWE. Pic Annette Dew A ROUGH WEEK FOR\nIF it’s not NRL, it’s soccer — with a pay dispute also seeing the Matildas tour of the US cancelled after the FFA and PFA failed to reach agreement. While the dispute will eventually be resolved, it is a pity the Matildas did not get the chance to test themselves against the world’s best. FFA boss David Gallop accused the players’ association of using the Matildas as a pawn in pay negotiations, the PFA has returned fire. What’s not confusing is sportswomen back the Matildas’ stance.\nDON’T MISS\nWHERE else do sports fans go this week but to watch Jarryd Hayne make his NFL debut. The 49ers play Minnesota on Tuesday (ESPN, 12.15pm). Coach Jim Tomsula has given no indication where, or even if, Hayne will play. Don’t pay attention to it. Such has been Hayne’s impact Tomsula’s reticence is believed to do more with not tipping off the Vikings than about any hesitation in sending Hayne out.", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0a654193241113bdf737ae7e222c3c3c", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9173e1bacee13eb30a84c6576330c901", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ce9eaaeca4f08a3348dc16929b0175fd?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1626a68ba793b728d6057504c0c8c57a?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent4.video.news.com.au%2Ffoxsports%2Fprod%2Farchive%2F2015%2F09%2F10%2FFSD_100915_NRL_COWBOYS.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4fa7a8322bd361cd2ea475f44dfa50e6", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/122e8e8db8ff946a9dba40dd88fe4d47", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/01540d1cbf9c070498614b568c9a9341", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/origin:video_integrator.E2eGNndzoyWfmw69xuzo11f9Lnj8LKub?t_product=video&t_template=../video/player", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/524f4517f20a2d39a4e94ed88452de75", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a83ec1f8b082e55f890c3bc565c9b060?width=650", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-09-11T20:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T18:04:15.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
