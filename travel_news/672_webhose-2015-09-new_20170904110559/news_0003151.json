General manager Sunshine Wong says aerodrome inns are evolving to promise travellers more.\n“Airport hotels were previously conceptualised out of practicality and used to serve a strict functional purpose to provide travellers with a place to rest between long-haul flights,” he says. “There’s now an emphasis on airport hotels providing guests with the best environment to feel refreshed in between travel and, with the rise of the health-conscious traveller, the ability for guests to use the gym and take a dip in the pool has become popular.”\nLOCATION AND LUXURY\nWhile it’s still possible to book a budget room near an international hub – think the Ibis option in Sydney and Melbourne – there’s lots of luxury popping up around airfields with top-end brands such as London Heathrow’s Sofitel and the Hilton Frankfurt Airport, joining Crowne Plaza Changi Airport on lists of the world’s best airport hotels.\n“As travellers become savvier, airport hotels have evolved from being just accommodation at an airport location into stylish hotels that can rival counterparts in the city,” Wong says.\n“Each room at the Crowne Plaza Changi Airport offers modern design, with elements inspired by nature to help guests feel relaxed.\n“The hotel has an outdoor landscaped pool which resembles a tropical oasis, a Sleep Advantage program with quiet zones to ensure guests are fully rested, fast wi-fi, fresh and fast food, and a fitness centre.”\n24-HOUR STAY\nSome airport hotels, including the Four Points at Los Angeles International and Bangkok’s Novotel Suvarnabhumi, recognise the normal check-in time of 2pm doesn’t suit everyone, so they now offer accommodation in convenient 24-hour blocks.\nThese programs let guests check in at any time of the day or night and depart 24 hours later, which is handy at LAX where most of the flights from Australia land at the crack of dawn.\nBy booking a room at the Four Points, travellers can catch the courtesy bus from the arrivals hall to the hotel, check in early and spend the day recuperating from the slog across the Pacific.\nThey can then check out at breakfast the following morning and return to departures for onward flights around North America.", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0a654193241113bdf737ae7e222c3c3c", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9173e1bacee13eb30a84c6576330c901", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4fa7a8322bd361cd2ea475f44dfa50e6", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/122e8e8db8ff946a9dba40dd88fe4d47", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/01540d1cbf9c070498614b568c9a9341", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/524f4517f20a2d39a4e94ed88452de75", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-09-02T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T18:03:03.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
