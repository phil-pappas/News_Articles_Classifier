This inauguration of a dedicated park for tourism pioneers was part of the 2015 Tourism Day Celebrations in Seychelles. \nAttending this auspicious ceremony were the Minister for Tourism and Culture, Alain St.Ange; Principal Secretary for Tourism Anne Lafortune; Chief Executive of the Seychelles Tourism Board, Sherin Naiken; Deputy Chief Executive Nathalie Didon; Principal of the Academy, Flavien Joubert; Chairperson of the Seychelles Hospitality and Tourism Association, Sybille Cardon; Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Marco Francis; tourism trade representatives; and other guests. \nSpeaking at the event, Minister Alain St.Ange said having the President at this event shows to the industry that tourism as an industry is appreciated by the highest office of the land, as it is appreciated by the government as a whole. \n\"Tourism is a business for each and every one of us. It has become the pillar of our economy, because we have all worked together in a successful public-private sector partnership to make a success of our tourism industry. We have seen dedicated Seychellois who have always stood by this industry. If it is what it is today, we must take into account that there were many individuals who have worked tirelessly even before we had our international airport, and that dedication to see our tourism industry flourish has helped give us today the industry we have. This is why the government felt that it was time that Seychelles honors and thanks its tourism pioneers,” Minister Alain St.Ange said. \nMinister St.Ange went on to say that the Seychelles Tourism Academy was the ideal place to have such a dedicated place for the country’s tourism pioneers. This park can serve as an inspiration for our future tourism leaders, Minister St.Ange added. \n\"Recognizing these devoted individuals can help us to understand where we are heading as an industry,\" he said. \nThe park was officially opened yesterday, but individual plaques with the names of pioneers will be put up during the upcoming Seychelles Ocean Festival in December. \nMinister St.Ange said this is because after the call made by tourism authorities for members of the public to put forward names of people who have contributed greatly towards the industry since its start, a lot of names have been nominated. \"We have actually been inundated with suggestions, and we needed to have more time to take stock of all the tourism personalities proposed before coming up with a first list we shall recognize,\" the Minister said. \nKathleen Mason, who has personally been in the industry ever since the opening of the island's international airport echoed words of thanks for this initiative of recognizing people who have contributed greatly towards the industry and those who are still doing so. \n\"Tourism is a small world, and it is important that we do not forget the reasons why visitors come to Seychelles,\" Kathleen Mason said. \n\"We can see clearly that our industry is growing from strength to strength. Seychelles must maintain its position as a dream destination if we want to succeed,\" she added. \nAfter the opening of the park, President Michel was invited to plant a coco de mer tree to mark the occasion. \nMinister Alain St.Ange and other tourism officials also took part in the tree-planting activity. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
