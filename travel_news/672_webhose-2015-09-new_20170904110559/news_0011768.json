Discover top attractions, restaurants, hotels and events and then curate your own theme-park plan. Write and read reviews of your favorite theme parks and attractions too.\nWhat’s hot: It’s a good starting point for those new to the theme-park universe and wanting to plan a trip. I appreciated that the photos were those of an actual traveler and not the perfect marketing photos you might find on a theme-park website. You can craft your own plan to visit a theme park by making a list of attractions and activities you’d like to see or engage in. If you want to book a hotel, the site links to the hotel’s website, but the options are limited.\nWhat’s not: Call me old-fashioned, but you know those theme-park maps you get at the entrance? I was craving that experience. Tokyo DisneySea looked incredible, but I wanted to see the overall big picture before I used the website’s “zones” and recommended “top attractions” to draft my plan. Filtering the restaurants and attractions by theme park instead of by destination would’ve saved me a lot of time. I’ll keep this website on my “watch” list. The site currently covers about 24 theme parks, but according to the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions , there are more than 400 amusement parks and attractions in the United States and about 300 amusement parks in Europe alone. Be patient; the site is new. I hope it can grow an enthusiastic user base.\n— Jen Leo, Los Angeles Times", "external_links": ["http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-09-11T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T03:47:03.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
