The region is now home to more than 200 wineries creating an extraordinary array of gold-medal-winning chardonnays, cabernet sauvignons and semillon-sauvignon blancs. Visitors are not merely welcome; they are lavishly catered for. Drop in for a tasting, gourmet lunch or behind-the-scenes tour at, among others, Leeuwin Estate and Cullens (biodynamic pioneers), or venture further south to rising star Snake and Herring, in the Great Southern region. Explore the wines and vines of Margaret River En route to most wineries you’ll also find numerous stores and farm shops offering everything from artisan cheese to chocolate, along with mircobreweries and restaurants doing delicious things with local seafood. Want to search for your supper? Head for the forests near Pemberton for a spot of guided truffle hunting. A taste for adventure As well as being a great place to satisfy an appetite, Western Australia’s south west also offers plenty of options when it comes to working one up. There are stunning beaches for surfing, snorkelling and sunbathing, spectacular tall-tree forests for exploring and climbing and ancient caves to navigate by torchlight. Working up an appetite in the surf The Bibbulmun Track, one of Australia’s great walking trails, also winds along the coast here (spot wildflowers and migrating whales as you put your best foot forward). Or how about an adventure by canoe? Paddle the Margaret River on a bush tucker safari. When to go The south west has a Mediterranean climate, best enjoyed from September to May. For foodies, the Margaret River Gourmet Escape, held annually in November, is not to be missed. Staged over three days it features stalls from 150 local producers and attracts a stellar crowd of international food and wine big-hitters. Relax at a beach barbecue hosted by Rick Stein, or head to a boutique vineyard to feast at an exclusive dinner from Michelin-starred greats such as Heston Blumenthal. The entire state on a plate Savour the flavours of the exotic town of Broome, where the outback meets the ocean. Try the mighty barramundi fish, tropical fruits, craft beers and meat from giant pearl shells. Catch & cook a seafood campfire supper on a kayak adventure led by a local Aboriginal guide in the Shark Bay World Heritage area. Take a \"knife and fork\" walk in booming Perth. From fine dining to fusion food trucks and whisky dens to rooftop bars, Australia’s sunniest city offers highlights aplenty for the discerning gourmet traveller. Western Australia is home to some of the world’s finest seafood Getting there Western Australia is closer than you think. Perth is around 18 hours flying time from the UK (four hours closer than Sydney). A range of international carriers service the city, including Etihad Airways with prices from £655 per person.
