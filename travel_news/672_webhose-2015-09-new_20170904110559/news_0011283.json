It’s contagious, judging by the number of us wearing white plastic climbing helmets while sitting in a room watching the safety video.\nNorthern Ireland’s newest visitor attraction has only been open three weeks, but with weekends booked up to the middle of October, it’s already a hot ticket. Even though it’s over 100 years old.\nBerkeley Deane Wise was the chief engineer on the Belfast and Northern Counties Railway at the start of the 20th century. He was also a one-man tourist board, coming up with new attractions to increase passenger numbers. Like the Gobbins Path, skirting the bottom of the Gobbins cliffs of Islandmagee on the east Antrim coast.\nThe original Gobbins path While the waves of the North Channel crashed below, workmen in bowler hats hammered metal pins into basalt and suspended bridges from them. Walkways were laid through caves and over coves, railings were installed to keep gentlemen and ladies on the straight and narrow, and an Edwardian travellers trail was born.\nIt was a hit with tourists and visiting engineers, but over the next 40 years the decline in the fortunes of the railway company, as well as the huge maintenance costs of all that cast iron sprayed with salt water, led to its closure in 1954. It disappeared from the guidebooks for over half a century; growing up in Derry, 70 miles to the west , I was unaware of its existence.\nBut four years ago, work started on a 21st-century version of Wise’s creation, with stainless steel replacing the cast iron and patches of new concrete where old steps had crumbled away.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest\nAs it’s an important nesting site for puffins, kittiwakes and razorbills, today the Gobbins can only be visited with a guide. Robert led us, with Clare bringing up the rear, making sure no one got left behind and reassuring one young woman who didn’t like the sudden darkness of one of the caves. They’re still new at this, which means the guides were as enthusiastic as we were about the 2&frac12;-hour round trip.\nIslandmagee, near the ferry port of Larne, is where many citizens of Belfast spent their holidays when the shipyards and mills closed for a fortnight each summer. When we reached one of the bridges, called the Gallery, Robert told us that workers on holiday from the Harland and Wolff shipyard stood here 100 years ago, watching the sea trials of the ships they’d spent the year building: the Olympic, the Britannic and, yes, the Titanic.\nThere are no ocean-going liners these days but remnants of Edwardian engineering can still be seen along the mile-long path; rusting handrail posts running parallel with the new (and more reassuring) stainless steel replacements, left in place in honour of the men who laid them using hand tools rather than tungsten-tipped power drills. Wise prided himself on safe working for his men, and despite an absence of steel-capped boots, safety harnesses and hard hats, no one was killed or injured building the first Gobbins Path.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The centrepiece of the original project was the Tubular bridge, replaced by this replica. Photograph: Aaron McCracken/Harrisons\nThe centrepiece of the original project was the Tubular bridge, spanning 20 metres to an outcrop called the Man O’War. The bridge was a cylindrical cage designed by Wise himself. It has been replaced by a replica, lowered from a crane perched on top of the cliffs 60 metres above.\nThose cliffs are crowded with seabirds during the nesting season, but they are few and far between at this time of year (on the upside, we were in no danger of being hit by fresh guano from above) and instead we had sunshine, which is equally unexpected and unusual in late summer.\nWe could see the coast of Scotland in the distance but it was the close-up view of the basalt, plants and sea that really makes the Gobbins experience stand out. We reached the end of the path and looked over to our left, where a cormorant was casually ignoring our cameras. We joined him in admiring the view from down by the water.\n“Right,” said Robert. “Time to head back. Take your time, now.”\nWe had waited the best part of century for this. We weren’t going to be rushed.\n• The Gobbins Visitor Centre, Islandmagee, is open daily from 9.30am-5.30pm.
