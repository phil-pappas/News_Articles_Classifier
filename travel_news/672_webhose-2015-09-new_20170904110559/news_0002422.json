Partnering with over 60 countries and more than 75 Instagram influencers, helloworld is creating an Instagram relay entitled #helloworldRELAY, that will capture countries, cities, people and places, through creative and inspiring images on the same date across our incredible planet. \nHTO is pleased to be part of this history-making relay, featuring Hawai‘i, the Big Island. Hawai‘i is one of 75 locations that have been confirmed across 60 countries over five continents. \nThe purpose of World Tourism Day in 2015 will be to raise awareness of the important impact tourism has on countries and communities arou nd the world and its potentia l as a force for good, creating a better world for all. \nAs the sun rises in each destination on September 27, Instagrammers will commence postings until the sun sets in their location. Beginning at sunrise in Samoa, the westernmost point of the earth, and travelling across the world like a Mexican wave until it finishes at sunset in the Cook Islands 36 hours later. \nHawai‘i Island will kick off on Monday September 28 at 2.15am Australian Eastern Standard Time (Sunday September 27 at 6.15am in Hawai‘i Standard Time) handing over the baton at 2.15pm AEST (6.15pm HST). \nAshlee Galea, Country Manager for Hawai’i Tourism Oceania said “We are very excited to take part in helloworld’s ground breaking social media initiative #helloworldRELAY . We have chosen to highlight Hawai‘i, the Big Island for “our leg” of the relay to showcase how naturally diverse Hawai‘i really is. With 11 of the world’s 13 different climate zones on this one island, followers of the relay will see everything from lava fields to snow-covered summits, one of the world’s most active volcanos, cowboy country side, azure blue ocean, lush rainforests and ancient Hawaiian sites of cultural significance. There will be no shortage of awe-inspiring scenery to be shared across Instagram.” \nHawai‘i Tourism Oceania has chosen Australian landscape photographer Pauly Vella as their Instagrammer for the day. Over the 12 hour period @paulyvella will show his 296,00 0 followers , as well as @helloworldAU and @alohadownunder fans, the natural beauty of Hawai‘i Island. From lava tubes to waterfalls to white sandy beaches, Pauly will highlight to our joint audiences, the power of Mother Nature. \nHawai‘i Tourism Oceania will host an Instagram Instameet at Sheraton Kona Resort & Spa at Keauhou Bay as the sun sets, as part of the #helloworldRELAY Hawai‘i Island finale. We invite all social media enthusiasts and travellers to come and celebrate with us on World Tourism Day, September 27 at Rays on the Bay from 6:00-7:00pm. \nTo be part of the RELAY follow @helloworldAU @alohadownunder @paulyvella on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter or go online at www.relay.helloworld.com.au or simply search #helloworldRELAY .
