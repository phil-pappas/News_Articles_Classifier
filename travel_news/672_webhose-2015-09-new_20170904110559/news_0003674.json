According to MMGY’s proprietary 2015 Portrait of American Travelers™, only nine percent of Millennials took a vacation primarily to gamble during the past 12 months, considerably less that the 21 percent who took a theme park vacation or 12 percent who took a cruise. Only 38 percent cite “gaming” as an activity of interest while on vacation, significantly below the 73 percent who cite “beach experiences” and 62 percent who mention visiting “theme parks.” According to the study, Las Vegas (cited by 51 percent) is the only gaming destination that made the list of places Millennials would like to visit on a vacation during the next two years, with significantly more interested in visiting destinations like Key West and Orlando.\n“Understanding the gaming preferences and behaviors of the Millennial market represents the next great challenge facing the gaming industry because of the sheer size and buying power of this group,” said Michael Pollock, a principal of Spectrum. “Through our partnership with MMGY Global, we will provide clients with factual, actionable insights they may use to unlock the potential of these future customers.”\nClayton Reid, president and CEO of MMGY Global added, “We’re delighted to partner with Spectrum to lend our insights and performance-based marketing programs to help cultivate this emerging market segment’s significant potential for the gaming industry.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T15:35:19.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
