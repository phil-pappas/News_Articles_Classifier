Numbers through this July already are setting new highs.\n“Last year was a record-breaking year, about a billion dollars in tourism revenue for the city of Pigeon Forge for the first time ever,” Leon Downey, executive director of Pigeon Forge Tourism, said. “This year through the first seven months through July, the tourism revenue is up 12 percent over that, which is pretty amazing.”\nOverall tourism spending is up across the county’s three biggest cities: Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge and Sevierville. Lodging received the most significant jump.\nGatlinburg saw a nearly 13 percent increase in lodging, Pigeon Forge saw about 21 percent and Sevierville recorded an increase of 7 percent.\n“Our biggest attraction in Sevierville is actually Tanger Outlet Mall shopping,” Brenda McCroskey, CEO of Sevierville’s Chamber of Commerce, said. “That’s the No. 1 activity that people enjoy when they come here to our area.”\n“The consumer confidence ratings are very high this year so people are feeling good about the money they have, gas prices being low,” Downey said. “All throughout Pigeon Forge and Sevier County, there’s always new offerings for people, so I just think it’s a combination of all of those things together.”\n“People come from all over just to see the fall foliage in the mountains,” Downey said. “It should be another strong fall, and hopefully we will finish the year even stronger than last year.”\nBut each city is waiting for the weather to give them that extra end-of-the-year economic boost.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:15:18.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
