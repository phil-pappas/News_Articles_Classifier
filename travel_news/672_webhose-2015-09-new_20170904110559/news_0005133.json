The app was designed with assistance from Grand Rapids firm Atomic Object. \nSince the finish of last year’s event, ArtPrize has worked to update both its mobile app and website. The result is a “sleeker, leaner design and surfacing the most sought-after content, features and functionality on both platforms.” \n“This year we really focused on presenting our app and website users with a more streamlined experience, not only in terms of aesthetics but in functionality,” said Jonathan Hunsberger, ArtPrize director of technology, in a press release. “Our hope is that these tools will become a focal point for visitors throughout the event, enhancing and informing their ArtPrize journey.” \nReturning to the app and website is the List feature. The feature allows users to browse the 1,550 artist entries in this year’s ArtPrize, allowing them to create lists of what they most want to see. The lists are then shareable via social media, text messages and email. \nOther users can browse lists that were made public as well. \nThe app also generates detailed walking directions between venues, which often allow users to more fully explore ArtPrize. \nEvent and blog integration with the app also informs users of what’s happening throughout the 19-day ArtPrize. \nAn interactive map on both the website and the app allows users to see the venues, events, restaurants and breweries in the area. Updates will be loaded to the technology throughout the 19 days for real-time information. \nThe app also allows users to skip registration lines. Once downtown, users can register to vote on the app. The public will vote for the winners of $250,000 via the app, ArtPrize.org or by text message. \nArtPrize runs Sept. 23-Oct. 11, with $500,000 worth of prizes up for grabs. Last year’s ArtPrize attracted more than 400,000 active participants.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T19:40:14.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
