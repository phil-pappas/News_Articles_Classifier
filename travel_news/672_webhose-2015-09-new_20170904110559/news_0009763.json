A highlight of this is the Full Moon Purnama Yoga, a first for Bali in a spectacular river-edge setting, under the glow of the full moon and twinkling stars.\n“Every full moon, or purnama, is a sacred day in Bali, when Balinese-Hindus honour ancestral gods and thank them for their protection with offerings and ceremonies across the island,” says Luisa Anderson, Regional Director of Spa for Four Seasons. “This is intended to counter negative forces and replenish our vital energy. Our new Full Moon Yoga program is inspired by the uplifting energy of this important day on the Balinese calendar, enabling guests to honour the yin, or divine feminine side with Moon Salutations, to counter balance the yang, or masculine nature of classical Sun Salutations (Surya Namaskar) of day yoga.”\nMoon Salutations are believed to cool-down fiery impulses and “hot” emotions, allowing creative energy to flow. The first Full Moon Yoga was on August 29, 2015, and the program continues at 7:30 pm on each full moon: September 28, October 27, November 26, and December 25, when it coincides with Christmas Day. Sessions are complimentary for in-house guests of Four Seasons Resorts Bali, while non-resident guests are welcome at a rate of IDR 300,000 per person.\nAlso a tranquil venue for private meditation sessions, the River Terrace follows the recent launch of the 100 percent bamboo Dharma Shanti Yoga Bale, located just across the ricefields, where guests are offered a dynamic series of wellness activities. Yoga classes at the bale include Bali’s first certified AntiGravity Yoga, created and founded by former gymnast and dancer Christopher Harrison; Laughter Yoga; as well as complimentary Sunrise, Power or Hatha Yoga. The Resort’s resident Wellness Mentor Ibu Fera leads the popular Life Talk series that guides guests towards inner peace, happiness, stress management and compassion.\nIn addition to the Resort’s weekly wellbeing program, it also offers an exclusive series of international yoga masters-in-residence, with the next “yoga masters to the stars” featuring Summer Dien (September 14-20, October 5-10 and October 12-17, 2015) and Faye Riches (November 9-21, 2015). The visiting masters bring their own individual styles for guests to further develop their own practice, complementing the Resort’s own classes.\nSource:-Four Seasons Resort", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T18:11:05.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
