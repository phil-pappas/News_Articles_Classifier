And to them it wasn't necessary to distinguish between the different tribes,\" project curator Rosie Weetch told AFP. \nWhile Greek society was structured around cities, Celts lived in farmsteads and small village communities. \nMore than 250 objects have been selected from the collections of the British Museum and others across Europe to illustrate the skill of the Celtic peoples. \nThey include the Gundestrup cauldron, the largest known example of European Iron Age silver work, which was found in a peat bog in Denmark. \nAs the Roman empire expanded, it took in lands that had been considered Celtic, such as Spain and Gaul. \nThe exhibits show how a hybrid Romano-British culture emerged, with local designs appearing on Roman helmets. \n- 'A powerful word' - \nThe final section of the exhibition deals with the Celtic revival in the British Isles, which began around 300 years ago. \nThe forgotten word eventually came to be used for the related pre-Roman languages of Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Cornwall, the Isle of Man and Brittany in northern France. \nIt led to the creation of a re-imagined, romanticised Celtic past that began to appear in art and literature as 19th-century discoveries fired up public imagination. \nIt is now used to affirm the differences which set apart the Scots, the Welsh and the Irish from their English neighbours, and the Bretons from the French. \n\"The use of the word has become politically motivated and personally important,\" Weetch said. \n\"Today in the United States, it is a really powerful word because it enables people to say something about themselves, connect to a deeper history and set themselves apart from different immigrant groups.\" \nThere are pictures of a Saint Patrick's Day parade in New York, Celtic tarot cards, tattoos and jewellery as well as jerseys from the Boston Celtics basketball team and Scotland's Celtic Football Club. \nThe Celts is the fourth in a series of major British Museum exhibitions, following shows on the Vikings, the Ming dynasty and beauty in Greek sculpture. \nTickets cost pound sterling16.50 ($25.20/22.60 euros) and the exhibition runs until January 31.
