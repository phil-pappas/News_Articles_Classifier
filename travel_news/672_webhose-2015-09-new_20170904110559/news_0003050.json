The only problem one is faced with is narrowing down the many options for things to do in town. Happily Four Seasons Hotel Pudong, Shanghai is here to help – read on for the concierge team’s top five picks of cool things to do on a golden autumn day.\nCycle Shanghai\nIn China, bicycles are more than a means of transportation – they’re a lifestyle. Just a few minutes stroll down any Shanghai street and visitors will see why China has earned the nickname “The Bicycle Kingdom.”\nCycling is one of the most convenient and easy ways to experience Shanghai. Bicycles are available for free rental from the Front Desk and include a bell, lock and helmet. Pick up a complimentary map as well for suggested routes in the area. Bicycles can be rented every day between 10:00 am and 4:00 pm.\nIf cycling isn’t quite up speed, visit the nearby Go Kart track for some high-octane fun. For more information on Lujiazui’s Go Kart track, contact the Concierge Desk.\nTour the Huangpu Like a Local\nThe Huangpu river divides Shanghai between east (Pudong) and west (Puxi), but various tunnels and bridges make travel across no problem. Tourists flock to the river’s west side Bund, and especially during the high season holiday months, crowds can grow to enormous sizes. Luckily there’s a better way to experience riverside views.\nHop on the Huangpu ferry for a mere two yuan (30 cents) to experience the best of east and west. Tour the full vista of Shanghai’s western bank to take in the history and culture captured in the Bund’s classic architecture, and glance back east to see the skyscrapers of Shanghai’s modern commercial hub, Lujiazui.\nAsk the Front Desk for detailed directions to the nearby dock.\nSee the Many Skylines of Shanghai\nWhether gazing from above or below, Shanghai’s skyline views are breathtaking.\nTo see Shanghai from an ideal vantage point, book a stay in the Pearl View Room at Four Seasons and access the best views of Lujiazui and the neighbouring Oriental Pearl Tower. Or, go to the 41st floor infinity pool, where one can watch both sides of the city light up the Shanghai night while taking a swim and a soak.\nSee the soaring heights of Shanghai from below with a morning or evening jog through the wide streets of Pudong. Don trainers and head to Bin Jiang Avenue along the east shore of the Huangpu. Runners not only get beautiful views of the west Bund across the river and Shanghai’s central business district to the east, but they’ll also run along wide, well-paved routes with plenty of greenery and shade – a runner’s paradise.\nThose who set out early enough in the morning may even find Shanghai’s famous senior citizen exercisers doing their daily practice.\nSource:-Four Seasons", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T03:16:13.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
