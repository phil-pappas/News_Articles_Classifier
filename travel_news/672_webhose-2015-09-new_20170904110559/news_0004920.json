But there are promising signs of more women rising through the ranks in the future, albeit still at very low levels compared with their male colleagues. \nOnly 4.5 per cent of Qantas pilots are female, but in its regional arm, QantasLink, 11 per cent are female, up from 9 per cent just 18 months ago. Jetstar last year appointed Captain Georgina Sutton, a former Qantas pilot, as its chief pilot , making her one of the first women in the world to achieve that role. And this month, the first-ever all-female flight crew operated an ATR72 at Fiji Airways regional arm Fiji Link. \nMs Carbary said there had been promising strides in attracting more female pilots at Middle Eastern carriers, but other parts of Asia were lagging behind. \n\"It is going to take time,\" she said. \"We need to continue to be out there and promote the jobs that are available for women in aviation.\" \nMs Carbary said much of the growth in Asia would come from low-cost carriers on short-haul flights. She said some of those piloting roles might be more appealing to women with children. \n\"In some cases women are raising a family and not able to travel as much,\" she said. \"But I think women could fill a huge role in being short-haul pilots around the world.\" Ad Feedback \nBoeing sponsors a few scholarships each year for women pilots to gain a 737 rating so they are more employable. \nTamara Bell, the director of national and international programs at industry group Aviation/Aerospace Australia, said work was being done on trying to boost the number of women in the industry. \nThe Royal Australian Air Force now holds a flight camp for high school-aged girls, and Aviation/Aerospace holds an annual summit on women in aviation to raise awareness of gender diversity. \nWhat do you think? Should there be more female pilots?
