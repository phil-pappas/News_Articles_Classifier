I have booked two and have my vouchers from cleartrip. But I have contacted the hotels too and the only one to answer kept asking me to transfer payment in advance and didn't seem to understand what cleartrip is and how it works. I have mailed them using an online translator to create Tamil text and have had no reply as yet to that. The second hotel, on trip advisor, had some neg reviews that all seemed to stem from agent bookings. When the people turned up there were no rooms and arguments ensued. They were told to take it up with the agents. Cleartrip were not mentioned. Make my trip and Agoda were. (Fell foul in Vietnam after using Agoda, but it was the hotel that chose to ignore and not save a room). So, has anyone booked a hotel through cleartrip and had it all work out. Here's hoping for no horror stories. Phil Always do sober what you said you'd do drunk.
