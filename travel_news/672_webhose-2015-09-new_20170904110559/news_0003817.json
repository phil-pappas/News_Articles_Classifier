Porsche had started the season as favourites but victory in each of the first two rounds, at Silverstone and Spa-Francorchamps, had gone to their rivals before Porsche turned the tables in the Le Mans 24 Hours, winning by just two laps in the second-fastest edition of the race in its history. Both teams had made excellent use of their Michelin tyres at Le Mans, and at the Nürburgring – where strategy is crucial – a similar story promised to unfold. One of the most evocative venues in motorsport history, the Nürburgring is much changed from its original layout, created in the 1920s as much as a proving ground for the German motor industry as for racing. Carved through the pine forests of the Eifel mountains, the 14.2-mile Nordschleife circuit featured more than 170 turns, rose and fell more than 1,000 feet over the course of a lap, and had blind crests that sent cars airborne. The Nordschleife staged the Formula One German Grand Prix 34 times until 1976, when the final race was marred by a serious crash involving Niki Lauda. After minor changes, it hosted endurance races, including the Nürburgring 1,000km, and the lap record of 6min 11.1sec for the final version of the old circuit is still held by a sports car: Stefan Bellof’s Porsche 956 in 1983. It’s the second time this year that tyre strategy has played a decisive role in the outcome of a round of the championship The new circuit opened in 1984 and was extended in 2002. A more modest 3.2 miles, with just 17 turns, it remains popular with current F1 drivers, many of whom have said it retains at least something of the character of the classic “Green Hell”. For drivers of the hybrid generation of WEC cars, it is a highly technical challenge, and this year tyre strategy was all-important. For the battle between Porsche and Audi, both marques used Michelin tyres, in this case the softer, high-temperature option for a dry, warm day on which the track temperature reached 37C (about 99F), with the detail specification of each tyre tailored to each team. Just in front: Porsche won at Le Mans by just two laps Porsche dominated qualifying, with the trio of Romain Dumas, Marc Lieb and Neel Jani fastest and Timo Bernhard, Mark Webber and Brendon Hartley second on the grid. The cars led from the start although the 919 Hybrid of Dumas, Lieb and Jani had to serve three separate stop-go penalties, briefly allowing Audi to split the two Porsches, before Bernhard, Webber and Hartley eventually claimed a brilliant win. Dumas, Lieb and Jani recovered to take second, benefiting from an inspired call by Jani on his final pitstop not to change to new tyres. For Porsche, it was the second time in succession that one of its grand prix connections had taken victory, after Nico Hulkenberg shared the winning car at Le Mans. For Michelin it was a fourth win in as many World Endurance Championship races, and the manufacturer was well aware of how significant a part its tyres had played. Jérôme Mondain, manager of Michelin’s World Endurance Championship programme, said: “It’s the second time this year that tyre strategy has played a decisive role in the outcome of a round of the championship. In May, Audi Sport banked on the longevity of its Michelin tyres to run double stints at Spa-Francorchamps before Porsche decided to use the same tactic. Today, it was Porsche who made the most of its tyres to win, highlighting the reliability of our tyres on what’s a highly demanding track.” You may also be interested in: • Latvala treads new ground with rally speed record • What to expect at the Goodwood Revival 2015 • Ben Collins reviews the Noble M600 » • Ben Collins’s top performance cars » • Renault claims Nürburgring record with Michelin »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T12:39:08.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
