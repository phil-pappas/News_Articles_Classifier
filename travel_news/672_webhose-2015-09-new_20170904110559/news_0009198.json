As previously indicated, lower fuel prices are feeding through to lower air fares. Wizz Air anticipates that the downward trend in unit revenues will continue in the second half of the financial year and reiterates that the Company has very limited visibility of demand in the final quarter of its financial year.\nNonetheless the strong H1 financial performance, combined with robust bookings for the third quarter, are encouraging and the Company now expects to report a net profit for the full year (excluding unusual and exceptional items) in the range of €190 million to €200 million. Wizz Air’s current expectations for full year performance are summarised below.\nSeptember 2015\nJuly 2015\nComment\nGuidance\nGuidance\nCapacity growth (ASKs)\n18%\n17%\nH1 2016: 17%, H2 2016: 19%\nAverage stage length\nUnchanged\nUnchanged\n–\nLoad Factor (%)\nModest improvement\nModest improvement\n–\nFuel CASK\n– 6.0%\n-3.0%\nAssumes spot price of $550/MT\nEx-fuel CASK\n+1.0%\n+1.0%\n–\nTotal CASK\n– 1.5%\n– 0.5%\nAssumes $/€ rate of $1.10\nRevenue per ASK\nDown low single digit\nDown low single digit\nPass through of lower fuel prices\nTax rate\n6%\n6%\n–\nNet profit\n€190-200 million\n€175-185 million\n(1) Excluding unusual or exceptional items", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T12:31:44.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
