Installed across two levels, the show boasts a panoply of exotic and outlandish footwear, ranging from an ancient Egyptian sandal decorated in gold leaf to a pair of Japanese wooden “geta” (a type of clog), finished with rabbit fur and silk. Shoes have the power to transform lives and transmit complex messages Within an intimate, darkened, boudoir-like space decorated with luxurious velvet drapes, the first half of the exhibition presents the majority of the wonderful shoes on display, organising them according to categories such as “status” and “seduction”. The curious, almost alchemical property of finely wrought shoes to beguile and obsess their owners is amply demonstrated. Here are spellbinding slippers for monarchs and mistresses, flamboyant boots for Victorian gentleman, and sandals with silver toe knobs worn by 19th-century Indian brides. All are presented as precious objects capable of transmitting complex messages about, among other things, power and sex. Birds eye view: 'Parakeet' shoes, Caroline Groves, England 2014 Then, upstairs, in a more open, brighter space, we find a section devoted to the practicalities of shoemaking, as well as a series of short, filmed interviews with some of the leading shoe designers in the world, including Christian Louboutin. This exhibition eloquently expresses something that anyone familiar with the fairy tale of Cinderella will already know: that shoes have the power to transform people’s lives. See Shoes: Pleasure and Pain until January 31 at the V&A, London. You can save 50 per cent on admission to this exhibition – and many more – with the National Art Pass . Look out for… Blue “mock-croc” Vivienne Westwood platforms This outrageous (and infamous) pair of shoes, with their killer 21cm-high heels, caused the supermodel Naomi Campbell to tumble spectacularly to the floor while wearing them down a Paris catwalk in 1993.
