Load factor for August 2015 was 86.2 percent, a decrease of 3.4 percentage points compared to August 2014. Contributing to this decrease was the shift of the Labor Day holiday. Last year, August load factor benefited from peak outbound travel related to the Labor Day holiday. This year, both the peak outbound and return travel related to Labor Day occurred in September.\nSpirit’s preliminary systemwide completion factor for August 2015 was 99.1 percent.\nThe following table summarizes Spirit’s traffic results for August and year-to-date 2015, compared to prior year periods.", "external_links": ["http://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/1QCL4bjgsaOmGWJFVnrqSXruM9oszzEu3A-Fu73BZnRrYYSGjSlCf1W0mj5NsothXRyKs2W92HZxNpxN3jX4IOiBfa7b6M6JYZ97Wl5GeX9pDMK_zS4NXH3OiyoRGh_JCWG1LnPabGGjXrxoNarTqWuCsxE4EEubmx_2CDSLFq8URdw6Z4maX78TxCmkQ3AdwDcKk64edlNdy6O8hAGrP517ZbOhQ4UnfN9dId7gLAa2Xu_jFCjPupaHow=s0-d-e1-ft#http://ir.spirit.com/common/download/download.cfm?companyid=ABEA-5PAQQ9&fileid=849961&filekey=9B28D020-1244-48D6-A2CB-85459D1C4357&filename=SAVE%2D0910Traffic%2Ejpg"], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:14:17.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
