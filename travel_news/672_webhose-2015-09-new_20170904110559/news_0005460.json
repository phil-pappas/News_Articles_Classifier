Week of Caring is a week-long community service campaign that Mercedes-Benz Financial Services, a leading automotive financial services provider in the U.S., has organized for the past three years as part of its corporate commitment to making a difference in the communities where its team members live and work. The volunteer projects vary, all of which will serve the communities surrounding the company's Fort Worth Business Operations Center.\n\"The Week of Caring is one of my favorite weeks of the year, because it is gratifying to see the impact our team members have when they roll up their sleeves and give back to worthy organizations doing great work,\" said Peter Zieringer , President and CEO, Mercedes-Benz Financial Services. \"In just five days, my fellow colleagues will clock nearly 4,000 hours of service benefitting 12 different community partners.\"\n\"It's simply amazing. Mercedes-Benz Financial Services has partnered with REAL School Gardens to build and enhance six school gardens over the years and they've also given their employees time to volunteer outside and help us build each garden in just one day!\" said Jeanne McCarty , REAL School Gardens executive director. \"Employees turn out in droves to shovel dirt, lay stone, build benches, and plant trees, all so kids can have a great place to learn and grow.\"\nMcCarty noted that because of this long-term partnership, in addition to building the learning gardens, REAL School Gardens has also trained more than 150 teachers how to use their beautiful new outdoor classrooms to get more than 3,000 children learning Math, Science, and Language Arts in the garden.\n\"We could never accomplish the work we do without dedicated and energetic partners like Mercedes-Benz Financial Services,\" McCarty said.\nProject examples include working with underserved students and families; planting and harvesting gardens; preparing food for those in need; neighborhood cleanup and beautification; and helping build a home for deserving families. Participants will volunteer at a community project of their choice with one of the following Fort Worth area nonprofit organizations:\nCommunity Food Bank ( Fort Worth, Texas ) www.food-bank.org Don't Forget To Feed Me ( Fort Worth, Texas ) www.dontforgettofeedme.org Community Storehouse ( Keller, Texas ) www.communitystorehouse.org Fort Worth Independent School District ( Fort Worth, Texas ) www.fwisd.org Kids Against Hunger Tarrant County ( Arlington, Texas ) www.kahtarrant.org REAL School Gardens ( Fort Worth, Texas ) www.realschoolgardens.org SafeHaven of Tarrant County ( Hurst, Texas ) www.safehaventc.org Tarrant Area Food Bank ( Fort Worth, Texas ) www.tarrantareafoodbank.com Senior Citizen Services of TC ( Fort Worth, Texas ) www.scstc.org Junior Achievement ( Fort Worth, Texas ) www.jafortworth.org Trinity Habitat for Humanity ( Fort Worth, Texas ) www.trinityhabitat.org Spark!

It is integral to how we define our corporate identity and how we do business at Mercedes-Benz Financial Services,\" added Zieringer.\nVolunteers from the company's headquarters, located in Farmington Hills, Mich. , are also participating in week-long projects during Week of Caring. In total, approximately 1,100 volunteers will dedicate about 8,000 hours of volunteer service, benefitting 23 different nonprofit organizations.
