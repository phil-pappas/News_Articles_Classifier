Most arrivals she said refused to enter the processing center and instead began walking to the nearby Austrian border. \n\nWire service MTI reported that 14 buses carrying a total of 830 people had arrived in Szentgotthard before midnight on Friday with a further 30 buses coming in between midnight and 7 a.m. local time. In addition a train carrying 2500 people had arrived overnight. On Saturday morning another train pulled in carrying 1000-1200 people nearly all of whom immediately set out on foot for the Austrian border. \n\nPolice say refugee traffic has been particularly heavy in Baranya Somogy and Zala Counties in the southwest of Hungary all on the Croatian border. The border towns of Beremend Magyarboly Gyekenyes Nagykanizsa and Letenye had received nearly 5000 people overnight who were taken to reception facilities at Szentgotthard and to Vamosszabadi on the Slovak border. \n\nOne train loaded with refugees crossed into Hungary from Croatia on Friday night police said. Hungarian authorities halted the train and detained the engineer and crew. They ID-ed the Croatian police officers aboard the train and returned them to the border. \n\nIn the meantime Hungary's defense minister has ordered military reserves called in according to a Defense Ministry briefing on Saturday. It said that the reserves would take over the duties the active forces had to abandon when ordered to the border or to participate in international military exercises currently underway. \n\nAlso on Saturday a court in Szeged SE Hungary ordered the official arrest of 11 men for their role in the break-through in the fence on the Serbian border on Wednesday in which demonstrators pelted police with stones and pieces of pavement Csongrad County prosecutors told MTI. \n\nSpokesman Ferenc Szanka said six were being held in preliminary detention and five had been forbidden from leaving the reception facility in a type of house arrest. \n\nOne of the men is under further investigation for other \"more serious crimes\" according to authorities. Initial proceedings had included 18 men including three international journalists who had been covering events.
