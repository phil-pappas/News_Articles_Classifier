He has learned how to open fridges, kitchen cupboards — and can even peel back a lid on a yoghurt pot.\nHe’s so greedy that worried owner Sue Kirk, from Sleaford, Lincolnshire, has had to install a child gate across the entrance to their greenhouse to stop Rollo from breaking in and eating her homegrown vegetables. The family has also purchased a new dog-proof fridge.\nSue, 51, adopted Rollo from the Labrador Lifeline Trust when he was just three — he had already been ditched three times by owners who couldn’t handle his constant bingeing.\nRollo: Adorable, but annoying. Source: Picture Media\n“Rollo is like the terminator — he’ll eat absolutely everything!,” said Sue.\n“He’s incredibly bright, you constantly have to be on the ball with him — he’s so clever. He’s constantly getting into things he shouldn’t. He’s always in and out of the vets after eating one thing or another — they are incredible.\n“All the vets know him very well — it feels like we’re permanently visiting after Rollo has eaten one thing or another.\n“We’ve spent thousands over the years on vet’s bills, but he’s worth every penny,” she said.\nSue Kirk with Rolo. Source: Picture Media\nSince taking in loveable rogue Rollo six years ago, Sue and her partner Stuart Maher, 47, have had to puppy-proof their entire house.\nThe couple have had to put a child’s stairgate on the greenhouse, chains on the doors and have even bought a new fridge after Rollo found a way to get into their old one.\nSue, who also has another Labrador, four-year-old Oscar, and two guinea pigs, said: “The only things he doesn’t really like are onions and celery — but anything else is fair game.\nRollo tucks into a banana. Source: Picture Media\n“He loves apples, they’re his favourite — he’ll do anything for an apple.\n“We have an apple tree in the garden, but there’s never any for us to eat because he stands up on his back legs and shakes the tree until the apples fall down.\n“He used to pick them for Oscar when he was a puppy — they’re both as bad as each other, they’re double trouble.\n“He’s even bounded up onto the trampoline and bounced up and down to get at the apples!\n‘Anything in here?’ Source: Picture Media\n“We’ve got Rollo-proof bins to stop him from rummaging, and we’ve had to put a chain on the door as he’s learnt to open them.\n“We’ve got a stairgate on the greenhouse, but he’ll body-bash it to get at the tomatoes.\n“Once he even undid Stuart’s briefcase and ate his lunch out of his lunch box.\n“He’s constantly on the hunt for food!”\n‘Nom, nom nom’. Source: Picture Media\nNothing is safe from Rollo’s unstoppable appetite — he once chewed the locks off of a Tupperware container to get at 12 chocolate muffins.\nThe hungry hound gobbled 12 cauliflowers from the garden — which Sue and Stuart only realised when they went out to pick them for Sunday lunch and found only crumbs remaining.\nHe is always jumping up on the table and kitchen counters, despite having a sore hip and dodgy knee.\nHe had a plate put in it after damaging a ligament — which was removed after his body rejected it.\nAt Christmas, he wolfed down five Christmas cakes in one sitting that had been left cooling on the work surface, then promptly threw up all over Sue’s sheepskin rug.\nRollo’s in heaven. Source: Picture Media\nSue was left terrified after Rollo started chomping on rat poison straight from the box.\nAfter a panic-stricken call to the emergency vet, who suggest vitamin K as an antidote, Rollo was saved.\nSue rushed out to the supermarket and fed him eight bags of spinach.\n“We do worry ourselves sick about him,” Sue said.\n“He will go to any lengths to get food. When I go shopping I have to bring in one bag at a time, and unpack them individually. We always have to make sure we don’t leave anything lying around that he might be able to eat.\n“He causes absolute mayhem — but we love him to pieces.”\n This dog’s food obsession cost his owners $54,000", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/09/30/1227550/905647-b3dbd8e0-670e-11e5-91d3-28f7a697e8f4.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/09/30/1227550/905377-b741e56a-670e-11e5-91d3-28f7a697e8f4.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/09/30/1227550/905132-b1ee65fc-670e-11e5-91d3-28f7a697e8f4.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/09/30/1227550/905218-abba8d14-670e-11e5-91d3-28f7a697e8f4.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/home/binge-eating-labrador-cost-owners-54000/story-fngwib2y-1227550906032", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/09/30/1227550/905291-b2e3de38-670e-11e5-91d3-28f7a697e8f4.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/09/30/1227550/905436-b0cd22a8-670e-11e5-91d3-28f7a697e8f4.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-30T23:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T09:25:35.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
