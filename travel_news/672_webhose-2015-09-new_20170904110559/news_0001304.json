Published on : Tuesday, September 29, 2015\nBudapest Airport has once again been shortlisted in the nominations for this year’s Frontier Awards – the internationally-recognised honours of the travel retail industry, which are presented on 21 October during Tax Free World Association Exhibition & Conference in Cannes, one of the world’s largest gatherings of travel retail professionals.\nAfter being shortlisted in two categories last year, the Hungarian gateway’s industrious retail marketing team’s campaigns have been nominated in three separate categories in 2015:\n• Speciality Concept of the Year for its ‘Most Beautiful Jewellery for You’ promotion with Swarovski, FreyWILLE, and Michal Negrin;\n• Best Partnership Initiative of the Year for its Trinity promotion held in conjunction with Heinemann Duty Free and Royal Tokaji winery;\n• Marketing Campaign of the Year by a Retailer/Airport’ for its ‘Lock your Love’ Valentine’s Day promotion.\n“On the back of our most successful retail sales year-in history, we approached 2015 with even more belief in the effectiveness of our innovative marketing activities. These nominations prove we’re on the right path,” says Kam Jandu, Chief Commercial Officer, Budapest Airport.\nReasons for the Frontier Awards nominations:\n‘Our most beautiful jewellery for you’ promotion – 210% sales increase\nSwarovski, FreyWILLE, and Michal Negrin joined Budapest Airport in a joint month-long promotion, installing innovative levitating displays to catch the passenger’s eye, generating a little shimmering magic throughout the terminal…\nThe popularity of the campaign saw a notable increase in brand-recognition, as well as the number of visitors to each shop, with FreyWILLE recording an extraordinary 210% sales increase.\nTrinity promotion – 5,000 bottles sold\nHeinemann Duty Free, the leading retailer at Budapest (and ‘The World’s Fastest Airport Concessionaire’ for the second year running at the Airbus-sponsored anna.aero-Budapest Airport Runway Run earlier this month), once again joined forces with the airport in what is steadily proving to be the gateway’s most successful retail promotion.\nInitiating its fourth Trinity campaign, Royal Tokaji gave passengers a ‘sense of place’ by building a complete wine cellar in the SkyCourt, taking customers on a wine tasting trip in the Tokaj region, while offering wine samples from a variety of grapes.\nAlmost 19,000 passengers tasted Royal Tokaji wines during the promotion, resulting in the sales of 5,000 bottles, generating another record 140% revenue increase.\nValentine’s Day promotion – ‘Lock your Love at Budapest Airport’\nBudapest Airport showed its commitment to its partners, passengers – and romance – by providing an opportunity for travellers to ‘lock their love’ to a giant heart-shaped ‘wall of love’ during its St. Valentine’s promotion. More than 700 padlocks were lovingly attached to the romantic feature in the space of a few days. Now permanently placed in the airport’s newlyopened observation terrace, anyone can ‘lock their love’ in Budapest…forever.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T12:23:16.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
