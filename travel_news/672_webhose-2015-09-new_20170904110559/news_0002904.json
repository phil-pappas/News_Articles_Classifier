For these applications, BorgWarner's mini direct-acting VFS controls line pressure from the transmission oil pump. Designed to deliver increased accuracy with significantly lower leakage, the advanced solenoid reduces parasitic losses from the pump, saving battery power to propel the vehicle.\n\"Proven in GM's global front-wheel drive 6-speed automatic transmission program for a range of Chevrolet, Buick and GMC vehicles, BorgWarner's mini direct-acting VFS technology adapts easily from combustion to hybrid powertrains, making this solenoid a fast-to-market solution for automakers,\" said Robin Kendrick , President and General Manager, BorgWarner Transmission Systems. \"Our latest hydraulic control technology demonstrates BorgWarner's drivetrain expertise in a variety of applications.\"\nBorgWarner's mini direct-acting VFS features an optimized hydraulic design to deliver increased accuracy compared with variable bleed solenoids. Substantially less leakage also allows the transmission to operate with lower main supply pressures, which reduces pump demands and improves energy efficiency. Suited for a variety of applications, BorgWarner's mini direct-acting VFS is virtually insensitive to temperature and supply-side pressure variations, making the transmission easier to calibrate.\nAbout BorgWarner\nBorgWarner Inc. (NYSE: BWA) is a product leader in highly engineered components and systems for powertrains around the world. Operating manufacturing and technical facilities in 57 locations in 18 countries, the company delivers innovative powertrain solutions to improve fuel economy, reduce emissions and enhance performance.
