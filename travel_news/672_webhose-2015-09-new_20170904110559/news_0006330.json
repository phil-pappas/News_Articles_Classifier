Proceeds go to a variety of charities across the community.\nApplications are open now until 30 September, prior to the online auctions from 10 to 14 November 2015.\n“Today we’ve launched a new online process for charities to receive proceeds from Sydney Airport’s popular lost property auction,” Sydney Airport managing director and chief executive officer Kerrie Mather said.\n“The auction of unclaimed items from the airport is a fantastic annual event, with a record $154,000 raised for charity last year.\n“All funds raised this year will be donated to charities making a difference in our community, with four charities to be selected and announced prior to the online auctions from 10 to 14 November.\n“We look forward to receiving applications from charities that align with our commitment to help the local community.”\nCharities are required to clearly identify their mission and purpose in advancing a project or initiative in health, education, environment or families in need which helps the community in Sydney and New South Wales.\nSydney Airport endeavours to reunite owners with items left at the airport. Items are logged into a system and stored at the airport for two months to give owners the opportunity to claim their goods. Where possible, owners are contacted directly or can contact our lost property department, but for items that remain unclaimed, Sydney Airport holds a lost property auction with all proceeds going to charity.\nLost property auction proceeds have supported The Salvation Army’s Red Shield Appeal, Youth Off The Streets, the Australian Kookaburra Kids Foundation and a range of other great charities in recent years.\nThe annual charity lost property auction is a milestone event in Sydney Airport’s community engagement program, which in 2014 contributed nearly $1.5 million to the local community, across charities, events, schools, sporting clubs and community organisations.\nSource:- Sydney Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T12:17:49.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
