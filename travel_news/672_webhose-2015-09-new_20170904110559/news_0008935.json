In 2014, a new alternative event -- Special Night Event at Kabukiza Theatre -- was held, and this acclaimed event will take place again this year on October 26 as one of the highlights of the festival. This year's event will feature a new 35mm print with English subtitles of \"They Who Step on the Tiger's Tail\", which was filmed before World War II by the great master Akira Kurosawa. The film is an adaptation of famous Kabuki play 'Kanjincho (The Subscription List)'. As a special treat, renowned Kabuki actor Kataoka Ainosuke will appear on stage for performance.\n(Photo: http://prw.kyodonews.jp/opn/release/201509163656/ )\nAkira Kurosawa adapted Kabuki play 'Kanjincho' for the big screen and completed it as \"They Who Step on the Tiger's Tail\" in 1945 after the war. Japanese censors claimed that the film ridiculed 'Kanjincho' and the very existence of the film was kept hidden. GHQ prohibited the showing of many works, including \"They Who Step on the Tiger's Tail\", thinking they would hinder postwar democratization. This created a moment of crisis for the existence of Kabuki in Japan . The ban on the showing of \"They Who Step on the Tiger's Tail\" was finally lifted and ultimately Kabuki's crisis was averted in part by a group of GHQ officers who understood that art supersedes politics.\nBefore the screening of the movie, Kabuki actor Kataoka Ainosuke will appear in the Kabuki performance 'Ame no Goro (Goro in the rain)'. The performance, which includes dancing, the richness of the kabuki genre, and the beautifully picturesque Nihon Buyo, will be enjoyed by everyone.\nSeventy years after the end of the war, this event of Japan's world-renowned Kabuki performance and Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece screening at the Kabukiza Theatre will be a night to remember and celebrate for national and international art devotees for whom art transcends international boundaries.\n\"28th TIFF presents Special Night Event at Kabukiza Theatre\"\nDATE: October 26 (Mon)\nPROGRAM: Kabuki Performance 'Ame no Goro', Film Screening \"They Who Step on the Tiger's Tail\" directed by Akira Kurosawa\nVENUE: Kabukiza Theatre\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/akira-kurosawas-kabuki-to-film-adaptation-to-be-screened-at-special-night-at-kabukiza-theatre-300143940.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/akira-kurosawas-kabuki-to-film-adaptation-to-be-screened-at-special-night-at-kabukiza-theatre-300143940.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=HK03400&Transmission_Id=201509160500PR_NEWS_USPR_____HK03400&DateId=20150916", "http://prw.kyodonews.jp/opn/release/201509163656/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T12:38:32.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
