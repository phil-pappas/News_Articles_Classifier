Oiga\nSeptember 20, 2015 “Ber” months spell high season in the travel industry, and this lucrative quarter may just do it for Tourism chief Ramon Jimenez’s 5.5 million foreign arrival target for the Department of Tourism (DOT) this 2015. In the recent Q2 Global Travel Insights Report of Sojern, the world’s leading performance marketing platform for travel brands, it showed that the Philippines is climbing quickly in terms of travel searches from Southeast Asian tourist, indicating an increasing interest in the country for the holidays. Manila Bulletin Lifestyle talked to Sojern’s director for Asia Pacific Stewart Hunter on what this dramatic rise in travel interest would mean for Philippine travel and his predictions for Philippine travel come ASEAN integration.\nIT SEEMS THAT MORE SOUTHEAST ASIANS ARE ESCHEWING LONG-HAUL TRIPS FOR REGIONAL TRIPS. WHAT DO YOU THINK BROUGHT THIS NEW TRAVEL TREND ABOUT?\nThat’s only true in the broader context of summer travel searches as they evolved from the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2014 through the second quarter (Q2) of 2015. Across all the regions we studied for our report, Asia Pacific included, travelers who searched in Q4 of 2014 for travel during the summer of 2015 tended to be a lot more adventurous with their destination choices. We are seeing a lot more interest in long-haul travel in Q4 than in first quarter (Q1) of 2015 and definitely than in Q2 of 2015, and that is a natural progression. Travelers who book closer to the departure date are looking for destinations closer to home. We nicknamed these three categories of travelers as “Adventurers” (travelers who searched for summer 2015 travel during the last quarter of 2014), “Realists” (searched for summer travel in Q1 of 2015), and “Procrastinators” (everything after Q1).\nHOW ARE THESE PATTERNS CHANGING THE WAY SOUTHEAST ASIANS ENJOY TRAVEL?\nCompare the list of top ten most searched cities for summer travel in Q4 2015, six of which (London, Paris, Sydney, Amsterdam, Seoul, Tokyo) were outside Southeast Asia, with the top 10 in Q1 of 2015, where you see Japanese and Korean destinations drop off completely and the other long-haul destinations moving down the list, with, finally, the top ten from Q2.\nIn Q2 only London makes the top 10 as a long-haul summer destination, and regional destination cities like Kuala Lumpur, Manila, and Jakarta rise to replace European and Australian cities. What does that mean for how Southeast Asians enjoy travel? Regional destinations can expect more love from late bookers and planners than from the early, more adventurous traveler.\nSunset in Boracay\n(Image by DENNIS G. DAYAO)\nHOW DO YOU THINK THE FORTHCOMING ASEAN INTEGRATION, AT LEAST FOR TRAVELERS FROM ASEAN COUNTRIES, INFLUENCE THIS NOTED INCREASE IN TRAVELER/DESTINATION INTEREST TO THE PHILIPPINES?\nThe ASEAN integration can only be a positive thing for regional travel volume from a business and leisure traveler standpoint. I do not feel we have seen a dramatic increase in volumes yet, however, the increase in regional trade and ease of access to the Philippines will increase travel intent and ultimately visitor numbers. The destinations that have gained most popularity with Southeast Asians year on year are Bangladesh, Qatar, and Croatia.\nSojern’s director for Asia-Pacific Stewart Hunter\nWHAT ARE THE OTHER FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THIS DRAMATIC RISE IN TRAVELER INTEREST TO THE PHILIPPINES?\nThe rise in traveler intent into the Philippines must be viewed within the context of seasonality and a relatively calm meteorological period. The peak season of in-bound travel to the Philippines occurs at end of last year and the start the first two quarters of the year. Over the past 12 months there has not been a major typhoon to disrupt the tourist season and it’s been nearly two years since Typhoon Haiyan struck. This has helped the country rebuild its image with international travelers as a safe and desirable place to visit outside of necessity for business or family reasons.\nWHAT ARE THE TRAVEL PROFILES (AND ORIGINATION CITIES) OF TRAVELERS WHO SEARCH FOR THE PHILIPPINES?\nThe top five international origin cities that searched for trips to the Philippines in the early summer months (May, June, July 2015) were: Singapore, Dubai, Seoul, London, and Hong Kong. Other cities in the top 10 include: Los Angeles, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, Tokyo, and New York. Tourist profiles are a mix of business and leisure, with this being skewed toward business for Hong Kong and Singapore.\nWHAT ARE YOUR PREDICTIONS FOR THE PHILIPPINES FOR THE NEXT QUARTER ?\nI would predict that the rise in popularity versus other destinations in the region will not continue unabated as July to September is the low season for the Philippines. The attraction of the country will continue to increase as we enter into the end of the year without any major meteorological events. With the potential for increased conflict and disruption in Thailand, the Philippines could also close the gap in popularity between Thailand and itself in the peak season.\nARE YOU POSITIVE THAT LAST QUARTER’S RISE IN TRAVELER INTENT WILL TRANSLATE TO TRAVEL/VISITOR ARRIVALS TO THE PHILIPPINES?\nConsidering that the top two cities for bookings made in the early summer months were Singapore and Hong Kong, we think that is a good indication that intent actually translates into bookings. That said, travel from Dubai remains strong, as does domestic travel. Additionally, Los Angeles was the fifth booking origination city for this period of time.\nARE THERE A LOT OF FILIPINOS USING SOJERN AND WHAT ARE THE DESTINATIONS THEY TEND TO SEARCH FOR?\nSojern’s traveler platform enables travel brands to connect with travellers, through digital advertising on desktop and mobile devices, who have expressed a high degree of travel intent. Travel brands who are our customers can connect to Filipinos through our product. A lot of Filipinos travel domestically: five of the top ten destinations they looked for during the same period (May, June, July 2015) are within the Philippines. But if we look specifically at international destinations, Singapore, followed by Hong Kong, Bangkok, London, and Los Angeles make up the top five destinations globally for Filipinos. The top 10 of destinations also included Tokyo, New York City, Seoul, Dubai and Denpasar (Bali).\nWHAT ARE THE TRAVEL TRENDS THAT YOU’VE OBSERVED IN THE PHILIPPINES THE PAST QUARTERS?\nIn Q1 of 2015, around the Lunar New Year (LNY), Manila consistently made it into the top 10 of destinations for travelers from China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Vietnam and was in third place in the overall top 10 destinations for LNY observing countries with departures just before and during the holiday, preceded by Bangkok and Tokyo, higher than Singapore and Hong Kong in the fourth and fifth place, respectively. The steady increase in regional popularity for the Philippines has been in part due to seasonality over the last few quarters and an increased proportion of last-minute travelers.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-09-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T23:15:29.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
