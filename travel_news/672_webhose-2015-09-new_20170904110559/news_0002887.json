In 2014 the company saw 11% growth in RevPAR (revenue per available room) in Germany and it has now announced the addition of its thirtieth hotel in the country (24 open and 6 in the pipeline). It will be the fifth hotel in Frankfurt, contributing to further consolidation in a market, which is now the second biggest by number of hotels, behind Spain. \nThe four star hotel, Meliá Frankfurt, will open in early 2019 and is a new construction project located in the Bockenheim district, next to the Natural History Museum and one kilometre from the central railway station. It is also beside one of the largest trade fair sites in the world. The site is the former campus of the renowned Goethe University, an area which will be completely redeveloped. The company aims to boost brand awareness for the Meliá Hotels & Resorts brand in Germany, which is also present in Düsseldorf and Berlin. This landmark hotel also expects to benefit from the busy trade fair activity in Frankfurt where some of the most important international events take place including the biggest automobile, music and book shows in the world. The hotel will be built and owned by a fund of Commerz Real AG, subsidiary of the renowned German Commerzbank group, with more than 40 years of experience in the real estate and equipment leasing business. The building itself will be developed by Groß & Partner, a leading German development-company, specializing in the development of high-quality office, residential and hotel real estate as well as urban planning in the Rhine-Main area and Hamburg. Groß & Partner initiated the project and acts as joint venture partner to Commerz Real. The 140-metre tall building will also house business apartments from the 16th to the 40th floor, all boasting iconic and unique architectural design, created by a firm of architects to be appointed by tender. Meliá Frankfurt will have 291 rooms and several dining spaces, a spectacular sky bar as well as facilities for meetings and events, a car park and a full YHI spa, the Meliá spa brand. The opening of the hotel will mean that Meliá Hotels International is operating approximately 900 rooms in the city, in midscale to upscale hotels, joining the INNSIDE Eurotheum (74 rooms), INNSIDE Niederrad (146 rooms), QGreenHotel by Meliá (177 rooms), and a new INNSIDE hotel in Ostend (210 rooms) which is currently under construction and scheduled to open in 2016. With a corporate team in Dusseldorf, and more than a thousand employees in the country, the Spanish hotel company has consolidated its growth in Germany through three of its brands: Meliá Hotels & Resorts, TRYP by Wyndham and INNSIDE by Meliá. The latter was founded in Germany and added to the company brand portfolio in 2007. The INNSIDE brand has experienced significant growth across four continents since joining the Meliá Hotels International portfolio and the company will open five new INNSIDE hotels by 2017 in Germany alone. Gabriel Escarrer, Vice President and CEO of Meliá Hotels International, said \"We are very pleased to have extended our presence in one of the most important cities in Europe and with a truly landmark hotel, which will improve the positioning of the Meliá brand and boosting international awareness.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T11:19:17.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
