Image 26 of 26 Little-known Guangzhou balances China’s past and future 1 / 26 Back to Gallery \nStudying geopolitical economics was never a goal of mine, and I’m certainly not an expert in Chinese history, but I’m pretty sure there’s nothing in Chairman Mao’s Little Red Book about waltzing. \nBut there they were, three couples, older than me but much lighter on their feet, ballroom dancing across the broad central promenade of People’s Park, in full view of the People’s Government Building, dodging pedestrians and swaying to music from a battered portable stereo that was probably built when the Chairman was still alive. \nOthers were engaged in particularly feisty foursomes of gin rummy, aggressive strolling and stretching (at the same time), and a full-contact brand of Chinese chess. It could have been Taipei. Or Kuala Lumpur. Or, frankly, San Francisco. \nIt was not the China I expected. \nThen again, like so many other Westerners, I knew next to nothing about China’s third-largest city, so nearly everything about Guangzhou was going to be a surprise. \nAs the country’s marquee metropolises strive to be more — more Paris, more Tokyo, more New York — I wanted to find out if this city, completely overlooked by American travelers, can become the “next big thing” and yet still maintain a solid sense of Chinese culture, present and past. \nAnd, maybe, to find out what it takes to be fitted for an all-jade suit. \nHistory on the Pearl \nGuangzhou has long been the “country cousin” of China’s better-known northern cities, separated from Beijing and Shanghai by distance, mountains, ideals and cuisine, as well as by a different language, named for the label that Europeans used for the city: Canton. \nIt’s been a regional capital for more than 2,200 years, and its location on the Pearl River, less than 90 miles upstream from Hong Kong and Macau, made it one of China’s most important port cities. Guangzhou’s position, at the start of the “maritime silk road” linking southern China with Southeast Asia, India and the Middle East, meant earlier exposure to other cultures and goods as far back as the eighth century. \nIn the years since, the city experienced eras of colonialism, revolution and communism that it shares with most of China, and in modern times, with a largely industrial economy, Guangzhou grew into an unremarkable sprawl. \nNow Guangzhou is catching up to the New China of its northern neighbors, with massive public projects, scores of upscale hotels and wildly futuristic architecture. \nThe city’s most noticeable growth during the past 20 years has included a subway system to manage the distances, increased care for cultural monuments and the creation of a central business district called Zhujiang New Town, which screams New China. \nThe operative word is “new.” I was staying at the futuristic W Guangzhou hotel that at the time was barely a year old, and around the corner was an entire block full of restaurants that, according to a hotel clerk, hadn’t been there six months earlier. \nExploring the Zhujiang New Town area gets easier once you get around the new construction projects that seem to be on every block. The centerpiece of the district is the ¾-mile-long plaza with gardens, ponds and a labyrinthine underground shopping mall, grandly named Mall of the World. \nThe shape and location of the plaza seemed to be designed to focus people’s attention (and cameras for selfies, apparently) on Canton Tower, a 1,969-foot observation spire that resembles an Olympic torch in Technicolor and that as recently as 2013 was the tallest structure in China. \nWhile I wasn’t much interested in going up Canton Tower (views from high up can be overrated, especially if air quality is an issue), I was eager to get a closer look at the ultra-modern, seemingly inflatable Guangzhou Opera House (designed by Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid ) and the odd-angled Guangzhou Public Library, as well as get inside Guangdong Museum , which appeared to be the love child of a shoe box and a microchip. \nThe museum had several floors of rotating exhibitions, but one entire floor is devoted to Guangdong province, told through its culture, history and art. I browsed most of the modern, interactive exhibits before finding one on Chinatowns in other parts of the world made up of emigrants from Guangdong. \nIn a glass case full of artifacts, one grainy black-and-white postcard of a family was labeled, “1912, Chinatown, San Francisco.” Small world. \nIf I had any illusions about U.S. travelers having discovered Guangzhou, they vanished when I tried to help a couple in the museum take a photo — and it became clear they wanted me in the shot. \nThen a line formed. \nI realized I was the only Westerner I had seen outside the hotel all day, not a celebrity so much as an oddity. \nI had eased into Guangzhou through its most American cultural features — modern art, malls and skyscrapers. Then, when I left the museum, there was the flip side of high culture: the sign for a Burger King. Next to a Hello Kitty Cafe. \nOnly a few subway stops away, however, was Old World Guangzhou — the temples, monuments and historical landmarks, from Mao to a king named Zhao Mo. \nAncient shrines \n“Tempo prepah. Tempo prepah.” \nThe grinning man dressed in monk’s robes outside the Temple of the Six Banyan Trees appeared to be selling admission, although it turned out I paid about $20 for trinkets to “prepare for the temple,” but not for a ticket or joss sticks. \nEven with the smiling faux monks there to fleece the tourists, there’s no confusion that it’s a working temple — actual worshipers far outweighed the visitors with cameras. \nThe temple dates to the sixth century, although portions of it have been rebuilt many times, including the Lotus (or Flower) Pagoda, a nine-level octagonal tower that shows up in even the earliest maps and drawings of Guangzhou. \nWhile exploring the temple grounds, I had to wonder what places of worship such as this and the nearby Guangxiao Temple were like under Red China’s nationalized culture, and how they managed to be preserved. \nThen I watched a young woman give prayers at a shrine and hand a smoking joss stick to her 4-year-old daughter, dressed in striped tights and a pink sweater with hearts, and show her what to do. Tradition trumps dogma, it seems. \nFor most of the day I wandered Yuexiu Park, walking paths across and around the hilly grounds past shrines, a stadium, the Guangzhou Museum , the Five Ram Statue and portions of the original wall that protected the city, with at least one adult banyan tree growing from a crack between stones. \nYuexiu has been the core of the city pretty much since it was founded in 214 B.C. as Panyu, the capital of the Nanyue Kingdom, a region that included present-day Vietnam. \nIt was never more clear that this had been the original city, however, than in 1983 when crews clearing land for a proposed shopping mall found what was, essentially, Southern China’s King Tut. Workers uncovered the intact 2,000-year-old tomb of Zhao Mo, the second ruler of the Nanyue Kingdom, including a thousand relics in gold, bronze and every shade and shape of jade imaginable. \nThe museum is built over the top of the site, and visitors can descend into the original tomb. Even with portions open to the sunlight, the slab-covered burial chambers — both for Zhao Mo and for the dozen or so servants to keep him company — felt tiny, somber and more than a little bit chilling. \nMore chilling was the head-to-toe burial suit made of jade plates stitched with silk ribbon. I couldn’t help but focus on the suit, which was fitted to Zhao Mo right down to the fingers, like an intricate man-shaped puzzle with jade pieces. \nIn the end, the museum had done what the jade failed to do — preserve the king, and a big chunk of history, for the future. \nThe People’s Park \nGuangzhou might be further behind the curve in the pursuit of China’s next incarnation, but it won’t stay that way for long. \nExcept, possibly, in People’s Park. \nBecause of the name, I had come to People’s Park looking for a specter of Red China, of Mao’s “workers’ paradise,” but quickly found that I’d found Guangzhou. It made sense: Guangzhou associates itself with hometown hero Sun Yat-sen more than with Mao. And while the Memorial Hall of the Guangzhou Uprising is close to the south gate of People’s Park, McDonald’s is closer. \nAfter watching the waltzing couples for a while, I made my way down the tree-shaded main promenade, moving table by table to witness the China not interested in becoming Paris, Tokyo or New York. \nFor every warren of bustling vendor streets like Qingping Road, there are monuments on jungle-like hills. For every sprawling concrete plaza ringed by modern buildings, there is a sprawling People’s Park offering the embrace of the natural world. For every museum visitor wanting my photograph, there were men engrossed in their game, unaware of the American watching. \nRulers and regimes come and go, but every great city has balance. Next big thing or not, Guangzhou has it. \nE-mail Spud Hilton at travel@sfchronicle.com . \nIf you go \nGETTING THERE \nAir China, China Airlines and Cathay Pacific all offer flights to Guangzhou from San Francisco, with stops typically in Taipei, Shanghai or Hong Kong.
