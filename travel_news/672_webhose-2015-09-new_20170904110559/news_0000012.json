Poll  \nNewcastle Airport has been rated the best large airport in the UK by Which? Magazine readers for the third year running.\n \nThe final standings were revealed after 11,266 Which? members shared their experiences of the UK’s airports with the magazine. Newcastle topped the list of airports with over 4 million passengers annually, with a customer score of 72%.\n \nPassengers were asked to rate the airport on categories including the check-in experience, quality of food outlets and seating. The Airport scored particularly highly on queues at security, bag drop and passport control.\n \nDave Laws, Chief Executive of Newcastle International Airport, said: “Our aim is to be the most welcoming in the UK, so we are delighted to once again place top among the larger airports.\n \n“This is the third year running that passengers have scored us higher than any other large airport. It’s a testament to the work of our staff and business partners, who do all they can to make a passenger’s journey through the airport enjoyable.\n \n“The result is even more impressive as it came when we were undertaking £14 million development work to our departure lounge to further improve the customer experience. I’d like to thank our passengers for their patience during construction.”\n \n“This has topped an exciting few weeks for the Airport, as we have just announce the return of the United Airlines service to New York for summer 2016 as well as new flights to Barcelona with Spanish low cost carrier Vueling.”\n \nSource:- Newcastle Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T18:32:47.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
