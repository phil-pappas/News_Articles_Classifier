Obviously. And they must be a nightmare for those who aren't. \nThis is the downside of Airbnb and its competitors, and it's something I'd never noticed before. \nPreviously, I'd only ever seen good things in this system of facilitating private apartment rentals for travellers. For people like me, being able to rent a normal apartment at a reasonable price in an interesting part of a foreign city is one of the best things to happen to travel since the invention of the aeroplane. Ad Feedback \nI've been using Airbnb, and similar house-sharing websites, for a long time now and have had overwhelmingly positive experiences throughout the world. I've rented apartments in Buenos Aires, in Rome, Barcelona, Berlin and Tokyo, and they've all been great. \nI've been able to stay in real homes for the price of a cheap hotel room, places with kitchens and washing machines and couches. I've stayed in parts of cities I wouldn't normally have seen, neighbourhoods devoid of the tourist crowds. \nI've been given an insight into the way people live – whether it's in a shoebox in Tokyo or a converted warehouse in East Berlin. I'm a huge fan. \nI'm not affiliated in any way with Airbnb, and have never received any free travel or accommodation from the company. I just think that for travellers, what they do is amazing. It's a revolution. \nThere have been plenty of naysayers of course, most of who have a vested interest in the hotel business, warning of unregulated accommodation with no safety net for the traveller, but I've seen nothing but deserved success for Airbnb and its ilk. There's no downside. \nExcept, there is. And it's experienced by people like my friends in Brussels. \nBecause what about the residents of those tourist-free neighbourhoods that have suddenly opened up their doors? What about the normal people who find they now live in a quasi hotel that has no concierge and no check-in desk to help the bewildered masses who've begun showing up on their doorstep? \nMy friends' flat is a classic example. It's set close to the centre of Brussels, on a bustling street filled with cafes and bars. Their apartment building is a prime candidate for Airbnb, and sure enough, with a quick search you'll find there are three flats for rent to tourists. \nIn the last year or so my friends have seen a steady increase in the number of travellers arriving at their door, pressing the wrong buzzer, leaving their rubbish in the wrong place, asking for help and directions. These interactions aren't always an annoyance – to begin with they were a welcomed oddity. But the sheer number is beginning to wear them down. \nREAD MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T07:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T17:10:40.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
