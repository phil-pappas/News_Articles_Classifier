The biggest feature of Grand Hyatt™ Seoul’s app, which differentiates it from similar apps, is its ability to also look at happenings outside the hotel. Through the use of a new technology called Beacon, the Grand Hyatt™ Seoul app offers guests dynamic information on events going on around them at any given moment. \nBeacon is a communication technology system that identifies activities going on within a 50 m to 70 m radius of any mobile device and provides related information about these events — along with happenings at the hotel — via the app. For example, if a guest who has installed the app passes through the lobby, he or she will receive a stream of information about events going on in the Lobby Lounge. Via the “City Guide” menu tab, the app also provides recommendations from the hotel’s concierge about great restaurants and favorite tourist spots. Guests will always know everything that is going on around them, as the app keeps them informed no matter where they are headed. And thanks to its link to Google Maps, the app makes any place in the city easy to find. \nFor more leisurely browsing, the app also provides access to Grand Hyatt™ Seoul’s monthly members’ magazine, J.J. Magazine. Plus, payments can be made through the app. \n“The Grand Hyatt™ Seoul mobile application is yet another differentiator that reflects the hotel’s commitment to guest satisfaction. With this application, the first to be launched in Asia, we have found the means to communicate more personally with our guests and better respond to their diverse needs and interests,” said Grand Hyatt™ Seoul’s General Manager Adrian Slater. \nIn celebration of Grand Hyatt™ Seoul’s new mobile app, the hotel will hold a special promotional event, “Staycation of Your Dreams”, during the month of September. All guests who install or share the app via Facebook, Twitter or Instagram will be eligible to participate in a lucky drawing for a luxury experience at Grand Hyatt™ Seoul, including a one-night stay in a Grand Suite King, dinner buffet for two at The Terrace and a treatment for two at The Spa Grand Hyatt™ Seoul. \nTo celebrate the launch of the app on September 1, a special social event, “Staycation of Your Dreams,” will be held throughout the month of September.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T06:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T06:20:24.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
