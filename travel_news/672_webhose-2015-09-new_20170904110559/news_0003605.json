Local choreographers also took part in the dance sessions. \nThe dancers showed off their newly-acquired skills learned from the sessions in the finale on September 5 organized by the National Conservatoire of Performing Arts (NCPA) with the support of the Ministry of Tourism and Culture. \nSpeaking at the finale of the Biennale de Dances, the Seychelles Minister for Tourism and Culture, Alain St.Ange, said this biennale is set to put the country’s culture at the forefront. \n“Those taking part in this biennale are not only showcasing their dancing skills and sharing new techniques, but they are also showcasing their different cultures,” the Minister said. \nHailing this biennale as a success, Minister St.Ange thanked Mr. Pierre Joseph, the Director of the National Conservatoire of Performing Arts, and his team members for staging this great event. \nAmong those who were also enjoying the show and supporting the continued development of culture in the islands were the Minister for Investment, Entrepreneurship Development and Business Innovation, Michael Benstrong; Principal Secretary for Culture Benjamine Rose; Director General for Culture Marcel Rosalie; and Pierre Joseph, who heads the National Conservatoire of Performing Arts. \nCertificates were later presented with members of the dance companies, and a token of appreciation was given to Miss Pook and Mr. Pierre Joseph. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
