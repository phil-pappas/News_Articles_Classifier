Not so. According to a new study, the perfect car journey requires just the right mixture of tight corners and long straight stretches – a combination which demands enough hard braking and wind-in-the-hair acceleration to test anybody's skills behind the steering wheel. • England's best scenic drives And the best roads for finding this heady cocktail of slow-fast-slow-fast are dotted all across the planet, according to a leading hire-car company. • The best scenic drives in Britain: in pictures Avis has compiled a list of the globe’s best highways for adventures in rapid deceleration and putting your foot to the floor – with scenic routes in countries as varied as Italy, South Africa, Romania, the United States, New Zealand and France all making the grade. • Scotland's best scenic drives The UK also features in the list in the form of Bealach na Ba – a twisting ribbon of tarmac which picks a hairpin-laden route through the Applecross peninsula in the Scottish Highlands. • Wales' best scenic drives Here is a treat for any traveller who takes their driving seriously – a phenomenon which manages the highest climb of any road in the UK, rising 2064ft (626 metres) from sea level to its loftiest point.
