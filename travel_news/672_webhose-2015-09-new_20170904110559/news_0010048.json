According to a survey by the Brazilian Franchise Association (ABF), the hotel and tourism franchises such as network of hotels and travel agencies, earned revenues worth R $ 2.4 billion in Brazil during the second quarter of 2015, an amount that represents a 20 percent growth % compared to the same period last year.\nAccording to Tourism Minister, Henrique Eduardo Alves, among the factors that boost tourism are the favorable foreign exchange rate, visibility achieved by Brazil with events like the World Cup and the Olympics.\nThe trips have gained more and more space in the activities of Brazilians, according to Claudio Tieghi, director of Market Intelligence and the ABF.\n“Despite the struggling economy, the desire to travel has remained with the consumer,” says Tieghi. “It may be one day trip, cheaper and closer to place, but people continue to travel.”\nThe expert also said that there is demand from tourists for personalized services, a group that wants guidance for purchases and a relationship of trust with service providers.\n“Therefore, the tourism sector of the franchises continues to grow.”\nSource: Brazil Tourism Ministry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T01:28:57.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
