It’s unusual advice from US CEO Jeffrey J Davis. But the president and chief executive of mining firm Cyanco is a veteran globetrotter, at one point travelling 1,000,000 miles each year for business, so he knows a thing or two about the art of stress-free and efficient business travel . But his top tip for effortless travel isn’t to bellow grizzled country ballads in front of fellow passengers. Instead, it is to adopt the famously monochrome wardrobe of “The Man in Black”. “Black is your friend when you are visiting a different city each day and don’t have time to choose a new outfit every time,” he says. “It matches everything. “One pair of grey or black slacks and two black shirts will easily get you through a week-long trip.” Save time by not checking your bag where possible, recommends Davis. “You have to get everything in that one carry-on case, so you have to make a compromise somewhere.” Whether you go little or large on your personal baggage, though, protecting your items is crucial if you’re to make a great impression on arrival. A crumpled suit is unlikely to breed confidence in clients, customers or colleagues. Given the rough treatment handed to most bags, the more protective the case the better “Always buy a hard suitcase rather than a soft, canvas one,” says Daniel Browne, managing director of Blossom and Browne (the official launderers to the Queen and the Royal Household). Given the rough treatment handed to most bags, the more protective the case the better, he says. Really, though, says Browne, sartorial disasters are best avoided long before a suitcase is checked in. “Jackets are one of the hardest items to pack. Turn them inside out before folding them,” he says. “Use tissue paper to fill the sleeves of delicate blouses to help keep the garment’s shape and place some along the fold line of a dress to minimise the crease. “Always use white, acid-free tissue paper - never coloured. If a product explodes in your suitcase you risk the colours running.” Sean Davoren, head butler at The Savoy Hotel in London, advises separating all the clothing into corresponding piles for each item of luggage when packing for business. “Trousers are the first garments to be packed and should be placed at the bottom of the case,” he says, “with the front seam facing the back of the case, right up against the edge. “Smooth the trousers so they lie flat, leaving the length overhanging the edge of the suitcase. Lay the next pair on top but laying in the opposite direction. Carry on laying the trousers in this fashion, alternately left to right, right to left, suit trousers at the bottom and the scruffiest trousers at the top. Gently fold the overhanging parts back into the case. “Once packed, use a sheet of tissue paper to cover them ready for the next layer of clothes.” A professionally-packed suitcase like this can be achieved in just 15 minutes, says Davoren. It’s a small investment at the beginning of your journey that guarantees a smooth arrival. Best of all, it ensures you can leave the trouser press unused in the corner of your hotel room, right where it belongs. 10 tips for a professional-looking pack 1.
