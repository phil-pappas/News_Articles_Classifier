LOUIS , Sept. 2, Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc. (NASDAQ: ISLE) (\"we\", \"our\" or the \"Company\") today reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 ended July 26 , 2015.\nFiscal 2016 First Quarter Highlights\nNet revenues increased 4.2% to $246.9 million year over year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 15.9% to $51.1 million year over year. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 20.7%, up 210 bps year over year. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.28 versus $0.04 in the prior year quarter. Consolidated Results\nThe following table outlines the Company's financial results (dollars in millions, except per share data, unaudited):\nThree Months Ended\nJuly 26,\nJuly 27,\n2015\n2014\nNet revenues\n$ 246.9\n$ 236.9\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA (1)\n51.1\n44.1\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations\n8.4\n(1.7)\nLoss from discontinued operations\n(5.3)\n(0.6)\nNet income (loss)\n3.1\n(2.3)\nDiluted income (loss) per share from continuing operations\n0.21\n(0.04)\nDiluted loss per share from discontinued operations\n(0.13)\n(0.02)\nDiluted income (loss) per share\n0.08\n(0.06)\nAdjusted income per share (2)\n0.28\n0.04\n(1)\nFor a further description of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, refer to the reconciliation tables following the narrative and the definition of Adjusted EBITDA in footnote (1) of this release.\n(2)\nFor a reconciliation of the GAAP basis per share amounts to adjusted income per share, refer to the reconciliation table labeled \"Reconciliation of GAAP Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations to Adjusted Income and GAAP Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Per Share to Adjusted Income Per Share.\"\nVirginia McDowell , president and chief executive officer, commented: \"We grew Adjusted EBITDA for the sixth consecutive quarter, and this quarter marks our fourth consecutive quarter with a double-digit, year-over-year increase in Adjusted EBITDA.\n\"We continue to benefit from our enhanced operating model and better overall regional market trends. We improved margins over 200 bps during the quarter as we drove higher efficiency from our marketing programs and effectively managed our cost structure.\n\"We are making prudent investments in both gaming and non-gaming amenities at our properties. At the same time, we improved our balance sheet reducing our debt and interest expense during the quarter.\"\nFinancial Highlights\nOn August 11 , we announced that we will close our casino property in Natchez and entered into a definitive agreement to sell the hotel and certain assets to Casino Holding Investment Partners, LLC, the parent company of Magnolia Bluffs Casino in Natchez, for $11.5 million . The transaction is expected to close in October 2015 , subject to customary closing conditions. As such, the operations of our Natchez property have been classified as discontinued operations and as assets held for sale for all periods presented.\nNet revenues for the current quarter were $246.9 million compared to $236.9 million in the prior year quarter, up 4.2% year over year. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $51.1 million for the quarter compared to $44.1 million in the prior year quarter, up 15.9% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 20.7% from 18.6%. Interest expense was $17.4 million relative to $21.3 million in the prior year quarter, as a result of our lower overall debt balance as well as the benefits of refinancing our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2019, completed early in the fiscal first quarter 2016.\nDuring the quarter, we also recorded a $3.0 million loss on early extinguishment of debt related to completion of the previously announced refinancing of our 7.75% Senior Notes.\nOperating results in the prior year's quarter were impacted by $2.3 million of severance expenses related to the corporate office restructuring and $1.0 million in expenses related to a voter referendum in Colorado .\nAs a result of our decision to separately sell the Natchez gaming vessel and certain other assets, we determined the fixed assets were impaired and recorded a non-cash pretax charge of $4.4 million in discontinued operations during our first fiscal quarter. The loss from discontinued operations was $5.3 million for the quarter, or a loss of $0.13 per share.\nOn a GAAP basis, diluted income per share from continuing operations was $0.21 compared to a loss from continuing operations of ($0.04) in the prior year's quarter. Net income per share was $0.08 for the quarter, relative to a loss of ($0.06) per share in the prior year quarter. Adjusted income per share from continuing operations was $0.28 for the quarter compared to adjusted net income per share from continuing operations of $0.04 in the prior year.\nOperating Results\n(All comparisons are to the prior year quarter)\nBlack Hawk – Net revenues increased $2.7 million to $34.4 million , and Adjusted EBITDA increased $2.9 million to $10.7 million , or 36.2%. Black Hawk benefited from more effective marketing spend during the quarter and a stable competitive environment.\nPompano – Net revenues increased $4.2 million , or 11.1%, to $41.9 million , and Adjusted EBITDA increased $1.2 million , or 17.7%, to $7.8 million . The property benefited from improved customer reinvestment and increased market share.\nIowa – Net revenues decreased $0.4 million to $46.9 million , while Adjusted EBITDA decreased $0.6 million to $12.8 million . Adjusted EBITDA increases of 18.6% and 2.9%, at Marquette and Waterloo , respectively, were offset by an 18.7% decline in Adjusted EBITDA at Bettendorf. In last year's first quarter, Marquette experienced disruption related to road work in its key feeder market. At Bettendorf, during the previous year's quarter, a competitor in the Quad Cities market was closed for 14 days over the July 4 th period, resulting in a difficult comparison. Additionally the property was impacted in the current year quarter by ongoing construction around Interstate 74, which at times affected access to the property, as well as construction disruption from the South Tower hotel renovations at the property.\nLake Charles – Net revenues decreased $0.7 million to $31.8 million , or 2.2%, while Adjusted EBITDA decreased $0.6 million to $4.6 million , or 11.9%. Results were impacted by the opening of a new competitor in the market in December which has resulted in increased marketing spend for the property.\nMississippi – Net revenues for Lula and Vicksburg increased $0.4 million , to $20.5 million , or 2.1%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 54.4%, to $4.9 million from $3.2 million . In Lula, we improved Adjusted EBITDA 38.0%, to $3.1 million . Lula benefited from lower operating costs and more efficient marketing programs. Vicksburg's Adjusted EBITDA increased 91.4%, to $1.9 million from $1.0 million driven by optimization of marketing programs and more streamlined food and beverage operations.\nMissouri – Net revenues increased $2.6 million to $61.5 million , or 4.5%, and Adjusted EBITDA increased $2.5 million to $16.7 million , or 17.2%. Net revenues, Adjusted EBITDA and operating margins increased at each of our four Missouri properties during the quarter led by a 63.2% increase in Adjusted EBITDA at Caruthersville which benefited from improved parking and a new slots area during the quarter. Boonville's net revenues increased 6.0%, resulting in an EBITDA gain of 13.3%. Cape Girardeau generated an Adjusted EBITDA gain of 15.4% on relatively flat revenues as a result of lower cost of sales and lower marketing costs. Kansas City's Adjusted EBITDA increased 9.4%.\nPennsylvania – Net revenues were $9.8 million , up 13.4%, and Adjusted EBITDA was nearly flat, compared to $(0.4) million during the prior year. The property generated a double-digit increase in gaming revenue despite a decrease in total marketing expenses as it continues to focus on rationalizing marketing costs.\nCorporate Expenses\nCorporate and development expenses were $7.6 million for the quarter compared to $9.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. The prior year's quarter included severance of $2.3 million related to our corporate office restructuring. Excluding the aforementioned items, corporate expenses increased 10.9% year over year primarily related to an increase in non-cash stock compensation expense and the timing of our long-term incentive award, which occurred in first quarter of the current year versus the second quarter of the prior year.\nNon-cash stock compensation expense was $1.2 million for the quarter compared to $0.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2015.\nCapital Structure and Capital Expenditures\nAs of July 26, 2015 , the Company had:\n$62.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, excluding $9.7 million in restricted cash and investments; $989.3 million in total debt; and $159.0 million in net line of credit availability. First quarter capital expenditures were $15.8 million , primarily consisting of maintenance and gaming equipment purchases as well as spending related to the South Tower hotel renovation in Bettendorf. During the quarter, we spent $0.1 million on the previously announced up to $60 million land-based project at Bettendorf . We have spent $2.3 million on the project to date.\nConsistent with previous guidance, the Company continues to expect total capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 of approximately $100 million to $105 million , inclusive of approximately $45 million to $50 million of capital spending this fiscal year related to the land-based casino build out in Bettendorf.\nConference Call Information\nIsle of Capri Casinos, Inc. will host a conference call on Wednesday, September 2, 2015 at 10:00 am central time during which management will discuss the financial and other matters addressed in this press release.

Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as the primary measure of the Company's operating properties' performance, and it is an important component in evaluating the performance of management and other operating personnel in the determination of certain components of employee compensation. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA. Also, other gaming companies that report Adjusted EBITDA information may calculate Adjusted EBITDA in a different manner than the Company. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to income (loss) from continuing operations is included in the financial schedules accompanying this release.\nCertain of our debt agreements use a similar calculation of \"Adjusted EBITDA\" as a financial measure for the calculation of financial debt covenants and includes add back of items such as gain on early extinguishment of debt, pre-opening expenses, certain write-offs and valuation expenses, and non-cash stock compensation expense. Reference can be made to the definition of Adjusted EBITDA in the applicable debt agreements on file as Exhibits to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n2.\nAdjusted income (loss) is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure as this is one method management reviews and utilizes to analyze the performance of its core operating business. For many of the same reasons mentioned above related to Adjusted EBITDA, management believes Adjusted income (loss) and Adjusted income (loss) per share are useful analytic tools as they enable management to track the performance of its core casino operating business separate and apart from factors that do not impact decisions affecting its operating casino properties, such as gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt, certain severance expenses, certain expenses related to the Colorado gaming referendum, certain asset sale gains and preopening expenses. Management believes Adjusted income (loss) and Adjusted income (loss) per share are useful to investors since these adjustments provide a measure of financial performance that more closely resembles widely used measures of performance and valuation in the gaming industry. Adjusted income (loss) and adjusted income (loss) per share do not include the loss on early extinguishment of debt, certain severance expenses, certain expenses related to the Colorado gaming referendum, certain asset sale gains and preopening expenses.\n3.\nThe Company recorded $2.3 million of severance expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 related to restructuring at the corporate office. The Company incurred $1.0 million of expense during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 related to the Colorado gaming expansion referendum.\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/isle-of-capri-casinos-inc-announces-fiscal-2016-first-quarter-results-300136536.html\n©2015 PR Newswire.
