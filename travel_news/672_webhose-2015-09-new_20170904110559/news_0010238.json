Hospitality is an industry that cannot be ignored, contributing to 7.1% of Dubai’s GDP and with 96,000 rooms forecast to be in the market by 2018. Guest numbers have increased by 42% over the past 5 years, while Emirates Airline has done an excellent job in helping Dubai International Airport to become the busiest in the world.” \nHe continued: “Dubai is now an international city on the world stage, yet it only started developing 25 years ago. It now contains 8% of the world’s hi-rise buildings. To put this in context, the average age of hi-rise buildings in Manhattan’s famous skyline is 37, compared to those in Dubai at 8 years old. As a Dubai-based master developer behind some of the largest, best-known developments in the world, we are uniquely positioned to bring a range of unique, innovative new concepts that will further enhance Dubai’s hospitality offering.” \nThe Hotel Show’s Retail and Hospitality Partner for 2015, Nakheel, has 10 hotels planned for Dubai over the next five years. The company is also bringing a wide range of new retail projects to the emirate, providing fresh opportunities for new F&B concepts. \nOver 18,000 attendees to The Hotel Show, taking place 28-30th September at the Dubai World Trade Centre, have had the chance for a birds-eye view of Nakheel’s major development, The Pointe at Palm Jumeirah. Currently under construction, the unique development is set to bring Palm Jumeirah alive with spectacular fountain shows, promenade, and a huge variety of waterfront spots for dining, shopping and socialising. \nManchanda continued: “As one of the world’s leading developers, Nakheel continues to deliver a wide range of projects in line with the Government of Dubai’s vision for 2021.” \nOther highlights on the second day of The Hotel Show Dubai’s 2015 Vision Conference include panel discussions “New F&B projects, new territories and pioneers” and “The Chef’s Debate”. Avinash Mohan, Executive Chef at The Address Dubai Marina contributed to both. He said: “It is important for chefs and others in the F&B industry to share ideas that can help shape the future of the industry with pioneering new concepts. One of the key F&B trends emerging from today’s Vision Conference includes the rise of culinary interaction, where customers can choose their own ingredients and communicate directly with the Chef to create their meal. This is also a new culinary concept that we have adopted at the Mazina restaurant at The Address Dubai Marina.” \nItalian architect Simone Micheli, renowned for his futuristic hotel, pool and spa designs also presented in The Hotel Show’s new Design Theatre on “Hotel as Opera”. Micheli spoke on the future of Dubai hotel design, which he said will be created around “experiences” and “masterpieces”. \nChristine Davidson, Group Event Director of the dmg events hospitality portfolio, organisers of The Hotel Show Dubai 2015, commented: “There is a real need for the growing hospitality industry in the region to be able to share this level of information and insight, and we are pleased and honoured to have speakers at The Hotel Show this year with the experience, expertise and knowledge that Nakheel, Chef’s from top hotel brands such as The Address, and architect Simone Micheli bring to the table.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T00:35:59.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
