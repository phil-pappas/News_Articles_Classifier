And, at 21.1 inches, the seats are 1.85 inches wider than the previous generation seats.\nUSA TODAY\nFrequent-fliers wonder if new CEO will mean a new United Airlines\nIn addition to universal power plugs, a water bottle holder and a larger, extendable cocktail tray with a cool-to-the-touch granite veneer, the seats have six-way adjustable headrests and an articulating design. That means that, \"instead of a standard recline where you just go backward in the seat, this brings your bottom forward and gives you a sort of cradling motion,\" said Maria Walter, United's managing director of product development and brand management.\nDesign of the new domestic first class seats began two years ago, with focus groups of high-frequency domestic first-class travelers going to United's headquarters to test several seat designs and offer feedback on desired amenities.\n\"This is the seat model they liked best,\" said Nigel Goode, co-founder of British design firm PriestmanGoode, which is working with United on a wide variety of passenger experience projects. \"But they also wanted improvements such as more storage areas and more width, which were able to give them. We also added a more generous armrest and a larger tray table that allows you to work or eat while watching a movie on a smartphone or tablet,\" said Goode.\nUSA TODAY\nUnited now flying its Dreamliners to six continents\nThe first plane to have the new domestic first class seats will be an Airbus A319 that goes into service next week. United officials say the rest of its current fleet of 152 Airbus A319 and A320 aircraft should have the seats installed by the first half of 2017. In addition to the Airbus planes, United says the new first-class seats will be added to \"many\" of its Boeing 737s and 757s in 2016.\nAt a reception hosted by United in Chicago on Wednesday, some members of the original focus-group came by to test out the new seats.\n\"I can tell the seat is wider and it looks even bigger than it is,\" said Chris Pagnucco, a retired Chicago public school principal. \"I like these headrests, the tray tables and the extra storage space,\" said Pagnucco's wife, Patty, a teacher. \"And I like the fact that United listened to us.\"\nHarriet Baskas is a Seattle-based airports and aviation writer and USA TODAY Travel's \" At the Airport \" columnist.
