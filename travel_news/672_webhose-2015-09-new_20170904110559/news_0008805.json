In 2014, the sales volume of buses (including bus chassis) in China came to 606,900 vehicles, up 8.37% from a year earlier.\nIn 2014, the new energy bus became a new sport light in bus market, with sales volume hitting 27,000 vehicles, up 160% from a year earlier. In terms of power type, the plug-in hybrid bus gained in popularity in the market with its lower prices and high cost performance. And therefore it accounted for the largest share in new energy bus market, at 47.5% in 2014. Spurred by technology maturity and polices, the battery electric bus developed rapidly, representing 47% in 2014, an increase of 31 percentage points from 2013. However, the ordinary hybrid bus, which was not brought into the national subsidy list, occupied an increasingly lower market share, to 5.5% in 2014. It is expected to gradually withdraw from the market in the future.\nIn 2014, school bus market failed to meet market expectations, with the sales volume dropping by 14.9% year on year. In 2014, there were a total of 38 school bus manufacturers in China , a decrease of 11 from the end of 2012. That was because there had been no encouraging policies and financial support, so that quite a few enterprises chose to retreat from the market. In October 2014 , the Ministry of Education brought school bus safety under control as major educational emergencies, which can be viewed as a breakthrough in school bus policy, thus bolstering the market. In the first months of 2015, the sales volume of school buses increased by 22% year on year on year to 9,400 vehicles. The market is expected to grow rapidly if good policies are introduced in the future.\nAs the largest large and medium-sized bus manufacturer in China , Yutong Bus sold 27,398 and 7,531 large-sized buses respectively in 2014 and Jan.- May 2015 , which accounted for the market share of 33.65% and 31.71%, separately; the sales volume of medium-sized buses totaled 25,880 vehicles and 8,552 vehicles, respectively, with the market share of 41.28% and 40.93%. Yutong took the leading position in many bus market segments, For example, the company made up a market share of over 30% in school bus market and of over 25% in new energy bus market. In May 2015 , Yutong Bus displayed its high-end medium-sized business bus-T7, which is positioned as high and mid-end business bus. In future, the product is expected to break the monopoly of Toyota Coaster in this market.\nShenyang Jinbei Automotive, the largest light-duty bus producer in China , saw the sales volume of 116,500 and 54,000 light-duty buses respectively in 2014 and Jan.- May 2015 , which accounted for the market share of 30.24% and 33.78%.
