By Rob Owen PITTSBURGH POST-GAZETTE • Sunday September 13, 2015 5:00 AM \nSTRASBURG, Pa. — Parents instinctively want to re-create their favorite childhood memories for their children. When we adopted our son, now 5, he arrived with an innate love of trains that reflected and even outpaced my own childhood devotion to all things railroad. It was only a matter of time before we retraced my childhood visits to railroad sites in this Amish-country town in Lancaster County, with our towheaded son. Strasburg Railroad \n\nSince 1959, the Strasburg Railroad has offered excursion rides along its tracks through Amish farm country in lovingly restored coaches that are in extremely good condition. \nEach ride — pulled by a steam engine — is a little less than an hour. The conductor points out a turkey farm and teases guests with the notion of a “ghost train” across the valley that responds to the Strasburg Railroad’s whistle. \nThe Strasburg Railroad offers more coach options than it did two decades ago, including reasonably priced lunches in air-conditioned dining cars. This summer, the Pinball Pendolino Car made its debut, offering guests a chance to play pinball while riding the train. \nOur son arrived at the station in his striped engineer overalls, eager to board the train and equally interested in the station-based add-ons, including hand-propelled Cranky Cars and a miniature steam train originally used at Coney Island (both free for age 2 and younger, $5 age 3 and older). Red Caboose Motel \nFor the train fan who visits Lancaster County, there’s really no other choice: You must stay at the Red Caboose Motel, a fixture along the Strasburg Railroad tracks since 1969. Each of the motel’s 40 rooms is a retired train car: 38 cabooses, a baggage car and a mail car. \nLarry DeMarco bought the motel in 2005, and he has renovated many of the cabooses. The original room design from the 1970s was marked by tacky composite wood paneling; the cabooses with makeovers feature less dingy accommodations with neutral-colored walls, larger bathrooms and sometimes reconfigured bunk beds in the caboose’s cupola. \n“When I got it, the bank owned it and only four or five rooms were even functional,” DeMarco said. \nThe motel includes a dining car that is leased to a restaurant operator and serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. Train museums \nThree train museums sprang up within a mile of the Strasburg Railroad, two devoted to toy trains and one that displays the real deal. \n• The National Toy Train Museum, situated directly behind the Red Caboose Motel, displays toy trains from the 1800s to the present. It’s more suited to collectors or aficionados of Lionel trains and the like from times gone by. But there are also buttons to push to activate several train sets. \n• The Choo Choo Barn displays one enormous, highly detailed train set including tiny versions of the Strasburg Railroad and Red Caboose Motel. \nThe huge setup also features an A-frame house that routinely catches fire. A firetruck exits a nearby fire station, and when it stops in front of the house with smoke wafting out, tiny firefighter figures hop off the truck, raise a ladder and squirt real water from their hoses until the fake fire is extinguished. The level of detail fascinates kids and adults. \n• The Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania is the best bet for travelers with the time and budget for just one train museum. It boasts an impressive array of railroad equipment — steam and diesel engines, various types of train cars — housed inside a 100,000-square-foot exhibit hall. \nThe museum offers an educational wing filled with toy trains, a diesel locomotive cab simulator and a steam engine mock-up where kids can shovel “coal” (black foam) into an engine’s boiler. \nOn the last morning of our stay in this railroad buff’s paradise, our son started barking like a dog from the top bunk in the cupola of our caboose room, which is not unusual; he imitates our dog a lot. When we asked for a translation to English, we knew our trip to Strasburg was a success: “ Thanks for bringing me here,” he said. \nIF YOU GO \nThe Strasburg Railroad is located in Ronks, in southeastern Pennsylvania. \nCall 1-866-725-9666 or visit www.strasburgrailroad.com. \nLodging \n• Red Caboose Motel: 1-888-687-5005 or www.redcaboosemotel.com \n• The Choo Choo Barn, 717-687-7911 or www.choochoobarn.com \nMuseums \n• Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania: 717-687-8628 or www.rrmuseum \npa.org", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-13T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-13T15:36:21.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
