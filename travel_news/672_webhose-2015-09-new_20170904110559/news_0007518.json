But it isn't the first time the station has had a bright roof, as natural light was allowed by the Victorian roof built in the 19th Century.\nThe Victorian Birmingham New Street station, with a roof previously described as a masterpiece Credit: ATV/MACE Archive The original New Street station was in fact called Grand Central. It was a magnificent place, with architecture on an heroic scale.\nSo different to the concrete replacement so many people quickly grew to hate.\nThe station built in the 1960s that was still in use until redevelopment began in 2010 Credit: ATV/MACE Archive Even in its later days, the old New Street was an exciting place.\nEspecially if you were a trainspotter, like the radio presenter Les Ross in his younger days.\nPlay video But those passengers getting on the trains, were in decline. And people were demanding better services - and modernisation.\nWhat they got was the new New Street - built for a hugely contrasting £4.5million (compared to £750million for the latest rebuild) and opened in the 1960s.\nKen Wilkinson from Solihull, who is now 97, worked on that rebuild in the 1960s as a quantity surveyor. He said he job was hugely enjoyable to work on, despite the difficulties.\nPlay video But the new station did get some criticism in the years ahead!\nInstead of a glass roof, what the new station got was a shopping precinct - seen as being much more valuable to modern life.\nThe result was what some saw as drab, dark and dingy platforms.\nAs a traditionalist you could say you prefer the old one. But you have to look at the practicality of the fact that it is a working unit that is there to serve Birmingham and to put people on trains and take them off trains. The more trains you can get in there the better it is doing its job.\"\n– Bob Meanley, Tyseley Locomotive Works We're used to building work at New Street in the last 5 years - this is how it looked in the 1960s Credit: ATV/MACE Archive So Birmingham got a modern station - one that would last half a century. Now it's had another one, which planners will be hoping lasts another five decades.\nLast updated Mon 21 Sep 2015 Read more 35 updates Birmingham New Street's grand opening Travel Birmingham Birmingham New Street", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T20:51:04.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
