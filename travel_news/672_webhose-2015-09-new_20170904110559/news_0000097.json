The result? A dismal picture that pretty much nothing is safe. As the paper’s conclusion reads: \n“All of the apps analyzed in the study could be modified and manipulated to perform in ways that the developers had not originally intended. The top apps had little to no protections in place to secure data at rest and in transit.” \nIt’s really not all fun and games with travel apps, either. Many of us use them to book flights, rooms and transportation, syncing them up with personal information like credit cards, loyalty programs and itineraries. That’s important stuff to keep private. \nA Bluebox spokesperson declined to comment on which apps were analyzed, but the paper mentions the selection was based on App Annie’s iOS Top App Charts and Google Play Top App Charts . The top apps in the “Travel” category for iOS in the U.S. are as follows: Screen shot from App Annie \nAnd on Google Play for the U.S. under the “Travel Local category”: Screen shot via App Annie \nWhile most of Bluebox’s recommendations are directed toward the companies behind these apps, they do offer some words of wisdom for the average users about how to protect themselves. Bluebox Lead Security Analyst Andrew Blaich shared the following extra tips with us, as well: Make sure you’re downloading the app from the official Android or iOS app stores. Don’t follow links to download from websites, emails or third-party app stores. Keep your apps and operating system up-to-date. App updates often include important security improvements. Avoid using unsecured wireless networks. Passwords add extra security barriers. Disable any certificate authorities that look untrustworthy. If it looks suspicious, play it safe. Try to refrain from storing credit card information — especially if you’re not using the app all the time. If you’re trading in an old phone, make sure it’s wiped completely clean . “Triple check,” Blaich says. If there’s a passcode option, use it. Many apps have this as a separate security feature.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T04:13:28.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
