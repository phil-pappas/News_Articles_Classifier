A second zone, shown in purple and stretching from Logan Circle to City Hall, will not require tickets. \nBoth zones will be fenced off and participants will need to go through security checkpoints to enter. \nTickets for the red zone will be distributed primarily to parishes in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, but also in smaller numbers to parishes in surrounding areas. The Allentown Archdiocese is slated to receive 200 tickets for each event. \nOn Thursday, after public outcry about the newly-revealed ticket policy, World Meeting of Families Executive Director Donna Crilley Farrell said festival organizers had decided to release an additional 25,000 tickets to the general public, making them available online over the next week or two. \nThe additional tickets included 5,000 passes to Francis' Saturday address on immigration, double the number that had initially been announced. \nOrganizers will make 10,000 additional tickets available to the general public for each of the Parkway events, the Festival of Families on Saturday and the mass on Sunday. \nTo demonstrate that even non-ticket holders will get a chance to see the pope, organizers announced Thursday that Francis will parade twice on the Parkway, a shorter route on Sunday and a longer route stretching around City Hall and through the non-ticketed area on Saturday. He will also be visible on 40 Jumbotrons scattered around Center City. \nIt has been a rollercoaster week for the city and papal visit organizers, who had only just pivoted from explaining and re-explaining security measures to promoting the joys and opportunities presented by Pope Francis' first tour of the United States since his elevation to pontiff. \nSlow sales of special SEPTA passes for regional rail trains heading into the city over the weekend to see the pope and some remaining Center City hotel vacancies began to cause some to speculate turnout might not be a high as the predictions of 1.5 to 2 million. \nSEPTA printed 300,000 of the special $10 day-passes. \"We still have plenty available,\" said Jerri Williams, a SEPTA spokeswoman. Tens of thousands remain unsold. \nAn informal hotel room search quickly turned up rooms available at the Holiday Inn Express Midtown for $469 a night for a Friday through Monday stay, and at the Hotel Monaco, a Kimpton boutique hotel in the historic district, for $399 a night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T04:43:53.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
