Sources in police said that three other persons working in the agency and suspected to be involved in the theft have gone into hiding. The staff of the agency has been under the scanner of the police team probing the team probing the theft from a State Bank of India ATM at Veliyannur in Thrissur. The agency having its headquarters in Mumbai has offices in several parts of the state. The probe is focused on persons connected with the agency entrusted with filling the cash, city police commissioner KG Simon said. The 12 employees of the agency entrusted with filling cash and working in the region have been summoned for questioning, KK Sajeev Town East circle inspector told DC on Thursday. “It is clear that people knowing the secret code of filling cash in ATM were behind the robbery. So we have summoned all staff members connected with the task for questioning”, he said. So far no arrests were recorded in connection with the incident, he added. Police sources also revealed that the private agency has been lax in connection with the security of the operation. The secret code was privy to 12 persons while it should have been confined to only two persons at a time, they added. The bank officials came to know about the robbery on Wednesday evening when they came to examine the ATM following complaints that it was dysfunctional. On examining the machine bankers found that cash worth Rs 26, 02,800 including trays for keeping the cash was missing.
