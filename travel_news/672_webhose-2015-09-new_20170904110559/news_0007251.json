InsureandGo can help make this process stress-free with all pre-existing medical conditions considered and no upfront medical assessments or certificates when purchasing. All their policies are available up to the age of 100 so there is nothing holding you back! \n2 - Know your facts \nLike anyone travelling overseas it is important that seniors understand the culture and rules of the destination they are travelling to. For example, will they speak English? Can I bring my medication into the country? Are the activities I am participating in okay for my mobility levels. Smartraveller or the relevant embassy or consulate in Australia may be able to assist for any information you cannot locate yourself. \n3 - Pack smartly and know your conditions \nThere is nothing worse than carrying a heavy suitcase around which can sometimes be uncomfortable for the older traveller. Check the weather before you leave and only pack what you need for the time you are away - plus it leaves more room in the suitcase for souvenirs for loved ones when you return home. \n4 - Photocopy the important bits \nBefore you leave make copies of your itinerary, passport, visas and any other vital documents from your upcoming travels. Take one copy with you and a copy with an emergency contact at home. \n5 - Pills, pills, pills \nAhead of your trip make a visit to the doctor to discuss the medication you'll need to take away with you. Also be sure to pack enough medication for your whole trip and don't forget to factor in flight delays or other transit situations they may prevent you from getting home on your scheduled date. It's always a great idea to carry a letter from your doctor detailing what the medication is and keep medication in it's original packaging to avoid any unwanted situations in customs. \n* Tourism Research Australia 2015 (unpublished data) baby boomers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T01:02:54.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
