Dato’ Azizan is also the Chairman of PATA Malaysia Chapter.\n“India is a significant contributor to tourism in Malaysia. In fact, India is the sixth top tourist market for us. Last year, we had 770108 Indian visitors which is 18% growth from 2013 (650989). We are hopeful that MyFEST 2015 will keep Malaysia as top-of-the-mind tourist destination, encouraging Indian tourists to stay longer in order to enjoy the festival offerings nationwide,” said Dato’ Azizan. Updating the media about new tourism developments and products in Malaysia, Dato’ Azizan emphasized that besides shopping, leisure and luxury holidays are also key focus areas this year. The media briefing session included presentations by the Shopping Secretariat, Legoland and Hello Kitty Representatives.\nDato’ Haji Azizan is accompanied by Malaysian sellers who will help promote the country to the global tourism market. Among the sellers include big names in the local tourism industry, such as Tourism Johor, Iskandar Regional Development Authority (IRDA), Lexis Hotel, Tourland Travel, Borneo Nature Tours, Asian Overland, World Express, Planet Borneo Tours, Legoland Malaysia, Theme Attractions & Resorts, and Flexiroam.\nThe décor of Tourism Malaysia’s booth at the PATA Travel Mart highlights the Malaysia Year of Festivals (MyFest) 2015 in an effort to step up promotion of the tourism campaign. It is also in line with the Government’s efforts to promote Malaysia as a culturally rich travel destination. As part of its promotional activity, Tourism Malaysia’s booth featured Teh Tarik and Batik drawing demonstrations.\nDuring the participation at the PATA Travel Mart, Tourism Malaysia also organised various programmes for travel trade players to meet up and network among themselves, providing Malaysia’s tourism industry players the opportunity to strengthen ties with their Indian counterparts.\nThis year, the 38th PATA Travel Mart attracted more than 1,000 delegates from over 60 countries and facilitating over 10,000 pre-matched appointments, as well as brought together qualified international buyers and sellers for face-to face meetings, educational forums and networking functions.\nLast year, Malaysia received 27.4 million tourists, which was an increase of 6.7%. This year Malaysia is expected to welcome of 29.4 million tourist arrivals and garner RM89 billion in tourist receipts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:17:41.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
