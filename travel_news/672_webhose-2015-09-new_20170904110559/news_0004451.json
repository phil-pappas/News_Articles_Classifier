Continue the fun on board a Disney Cruise around the Bahamas or Caribbean for the ultimate Disney holiday. Walt Disney World’s six parks offer a truly amazing range of activities where you can create magical memories with your family and have something suitable for every member. And with more than 100 places to dine, there is something for every palate at every meal. Magic Kingdom Park has classic attractions for all the family, wonderful fireworks, musical parades and beloved Disney characters across six lands (Adventureland, Frontierland, Liberty Square, Fantasyland, Tomorrowland and Main Street, USA). Thrill seekers can enjoy the high-octane Rock ‘N’ Roller Coaster At the end of Main Street sits the magical Cinderella Castle, and thrill-seekers will love the big rides, ranging from Space Mountain to the Haunted Mansion, while the Dumbo the Elephant ride and the recent addition to Fantasyland, the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, feature as favourite attractions. Epcot has two distinct realms: Future World, featuring technological innovations; and World Showcase, celebrating the culture and cuisine of 11 countries through pavilions, attractions, food and events. Must-dos at Epcot include Test Track, where you can design your own concept car, then take it for a high-octane spin to see how it performs in an amazing simulation, and Soarin’, the awe-inspiring experience that makes you feel like you are hang-gliding over the beautiful landscapes of California. Disney’s Hollywood Studios celebrates the glitz and glamour of the film world, with attractions based on blockbuster movies and TV shows in eight areas: Hollywood Boulevard, Echo Lake, Sunset Boulevard, Streets of America, Commissary Lane, Pixar Place, Mickey Avenue and Animation Courtyard. You will love Toy Story Midway Mania, where you can join Andy’s friends, Woody, Hamm, Buzz Lightyear and Rex for fun games and rides. Younger children will be entranced by Disney Junior Live, where they can sing and dance with their favourite characters Doc McStuffins, Sofia the First, and Jake and his band of Never Land Pirates. Light years ahead: Toy Story Midway Mania is always a hit with children Thrill-seeking families can enjoy the high-octane 100km/h Rock ‘N’ Roller Coaster starring Aerosmith, and the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror – a lift that climbs high before crashing back down to ground level.

More fun awaits at two brilliant water parks, Disney’s Typhoon Lagoon and Disney’s Blizzard Beach, packed with thrill rides and even a surf pool. Board a two-person raft to take on Typhoon Lagoon’s Crush ‘n’ Gusher, sending you flying down a “fruit chute” around hairpin bends as you are blasted with water jets.
