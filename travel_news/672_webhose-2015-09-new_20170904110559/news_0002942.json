Her mission was to boost mutual understanding among young people in China and Europe. Since then, China’s vice-premier has been to 20 European countries, making her most recent trip in mid-September to visit Britain, Belgium and the European Union headquarters to promote people-to-people exchanges. During her visit to Britain from September 17 to 20, Ms Liu led the third meeting of the China-UK High-Level People-to-People Exchange Mechanism with co-chairman Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, and attended the China-UK Young Leaders Roundtable.

The event was aimed at building understanding and personal relations between rising political leaders from legislatures, society, think tanks and businesses. “The upcoming state visit of President Xi will be a milestone for relations and the people-to-people dialogue will lay a solid foundation,” she said. Experts from both countries said people-to-people and cultural co-operation have become increasingly significant in strengthening understanding, deepening friendship and promot ing China-Britain collaboration. “In recent years, many positive outcomes have been achieved in the fields of education, science, technology, culture, sports, youth and media since the establishment of the People-to-People Dialogue,” said Xiang Xiaowei at the Chinese embassy in London. “It has provided a steady and inexhaustible impetus for the development of bilateral relations.” Ms Liu also attended health policy and cultural dialogues, and the inauguration of new teaching facilities at the London Confucius Institute for Traditional Chinese Medicine. She also visited Wales, attended a symposium on science and technology innovation and delivered a speech at an innovation and entrepreneurship forum at Cardi University. Before visiting Britain, Ms Liu had participated in a series of activities promoting people-to-people exchanges in Belgium. In a meeting with Chinese students in Brussels, she asked about their academic performance and encouraged them to build bridges between China and Europe. There are still gaps in understanding that need to closed and “to achieve that youth is our hope”, said Ms Liu during a speech at Vrije Universiteit Brussel on September 16. Later, at the third round of the EU-China High-Level People-to-People Dialogue, Ms Liu and her EU counterpart, Tibor Navracsics, agreed to boost student exchanges. “I want to promote our respective programmes for education, training, culture, youth and research,” said Mr Navracsics, the European commissioner for education, culture, youth and sport. “These programmes give millions of young people the chance to study, work and volunteer in another country.” China and the EU began to build the People-to-People Dialogue in 2012, making it the third pillar of the bilateral partnership after the Strategic Dialogue and the Economic and Trade Dialogue. We’ll open our doors wider, offering access for foreign youths to learn and understand China Mr Navracsics said he wanted to develop common strategies for the internationalisation of higher education and continue to launch new projects for cultural diplomacy to support the contribution of culture to regional and urban development. “We must give new impetus to our joint activities for young people and support language learning,” he said. Ms Liu said China would encourage more students to head overseas while the country also planned to boost the number of foreign students in China to 500,000, up from the current 360,000, by the end of 2020. “This means we’re going to increase the number of foreign students in China by about 150,000 in the coming five years,” the vice-premier said. “We’ll open our doors wider and wider, offering access for foreign youths to learn and understand China.” Citing President Xi Jinping’s proposals to forge a partnership of peace, growth, reform and civilisation between China and the EU, she said deepening peopleto-people exchanges could solidify the foundations of such a partnership. “I’m here to help materialise President Xi’s proposals, together with our European friends,” she added. Ms Liu had a dinner discussion with 10 senior European experts on China who are also directors of Confucius institutes in Belgium. Along with Belgian Deputy Prime Minister Didier Reynders, she also inaugurated the China Cultural Centre in Brussels, which is walking distance from the EU headquarters. “Belgians are readily becoming interested in China and this cultural centre will help bring our people closer,” said Mr Reynders. Shi Jian, an expert in EU-China studies at Sichuan University, said more than 90 per cent of European college students have not visited China. “Most of their knowledge about China comes from the Internet, newspapers and TV, and less than 40 per cent of that knowledge is from the classroom,” he said. “Chinese college students share a similar situation when talking about their knowledge of Europe.” Gao Shuang contributed to this story.
