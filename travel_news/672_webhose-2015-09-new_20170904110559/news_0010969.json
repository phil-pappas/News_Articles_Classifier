Read this article. \nSummer is drawing to a close and the Labor Day holiday will soon be here. From September 5 to September 7, Americans will be celebrating the last three-day weekend of the year. If you're looking for a fun and unusual way to close out the summer, why not take a a sightseeing flight tour of the Grand Canyon? With Labor Day coming up fast, you'll need to decide on your tour package and make your booking within the next week. Flying From VegasThe tours that originate in Vegas can be landing tours or aerial tours. My favorite Grand Canyon helicopters are those that land at the canyon, especially the one that lands at the bottom, right next to the Colorado River. This tour includes a nice champagne picnic and you can also add on a river boat tour that is very scenic and fun. You can even do more fun things. Helicopters can land on top of the rim too. This will allow you to check out the sights from the top of the canyon, and you will even get tickets to the famous Grand Canyon Skywalk. The Skywalk is an amazing structure made of steel and glass that allows you to stand suspended thousands of feet above the floor of the canyon. The view is simply amazing and it is a great addition to an aerial tour of the canyon. If you're in a larger group or are looking for the most economical tickets, you could try an airplane tour. Airplanes don't land on the canyon floor, but they do cover the same ground as helicopters, and the only difference is you'll fly at a higher altitude. Also, if you plan to book a South Rim tour, then taking an airplane tour out of Vegas is the best way to get there. South Rim Air ToursIf you start your tour from Tusayan, or even if you fly there from Vegas, you'll be able to choose from two helicopter tours. One gives you thirty minutes of air time and flies over to the North Rim and circles back. The other tour is highly recommended because it give you 50 minutes of flight time. This long tour flies over to the eastern border of the park as well as the remote North Rim and the South Rim. This tour covers so much that you will see almost 75% of the Grand Canyon!Although you won't get to land inside the rim, you can take a Jeep tour from the South Rim. If you do that, you'll get a 2 1/2 hour 4x4 ride through the park see the sights up close. Seeing the landmarks from the ground will offer you a new and exciting perspective. Different Aircraft For Basic And DeluxeBasic tours are the most inexpensive tours available. These Grand Canyon flights utilize Bell Rangers and AStar choppers. They provide excellent sightseeing, but if you have a little extra to spend, then it's worth booking a deluxe tour. The deluxe helicopter tours fly on EcoStar sightseeing helicopters. These are purpose built for sightseeing tourism, and when you're in the cockpit you will feel why. The seats are stadium style bucket seats, so everyone gets an unobstructed view. The cabin is quiet and roomy, and you'll appreciate the huge wraparound window which gives you the best views possible. Another perk of deluxe tours is that they come with free shuttle transportation from your Vegas hotel to the helipad located on the Strip. The tour airplanes carry 19 passengers at a time and the tours utilize Twin Otter airplanes. Their windows are oversized to provide the best possible sightseeing experience.
