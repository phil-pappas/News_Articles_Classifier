Instead of accusing this and that, the Saudis should accept the responsibility and apologize to the Muslims and the victims' families,\" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was quoted as saying. Deadly stampede at Mecca highlights dangers of hajj \nShi'ite Muslim Iran, which is locked in a series of proxy wars in Arab countries around the Sunni Muslim kingdom, says that at least 144 Iranians are among the dead. Over 300 other Iranians remain unaccounted for, including former ambassador to Lebanon Ghazanfar Roknabadi, Fars news agency reported. \n\"The Islamic World has a lot of questions. The death of more than 1,000 people is not a small issue. Muslim countries should focus on this,\" Khamenei said. Other Iranians officials have also alleged the total death toll is more than 1,000. \nThe disaster happened when two large groups of pilgrims collided at a crossroads in Mina, a few kilometres east of Mecca, on their way to performing the \"stoning of the devil\" ritual at Jamarat. \nIran has summoned the Saudi charge d'affairs three times to ask Riyadh for more cooperation over the incident. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani demanded an investigation into a crush in his speech at the United Nations on Saturday. \nParliament is meeting behind closed doors to decide how Iran should pursue this incident legally. \nFollow us on Twitter: @CNBCWorld SHOW COMMENTS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T13:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T04:46:50.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
