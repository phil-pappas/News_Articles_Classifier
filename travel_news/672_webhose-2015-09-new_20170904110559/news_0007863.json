The creepiest thing to me was the length of Dr. Facilier's fingers. They're about 10 inches long each and the castmember playing the bad fella from \"The Princess and the Frog\" knew how to use them. \nThe march of the gravediggers, though, is probably the most popular feature of the parade, with their scraping shovels, and of course there's the vanguard of the whole parade, the Headless Horseman, which may be perhaps the scariest cartoon Disney ever produced. \nOf course, the final few floats of the parade are more traditionally what one might expect from Disney including the not-so-scary Country Bears and a chicken in a henhouse. \nAnd in true Disney style, there's no better way to stave off any potential nightmares than a giant bicycle-powered Goofy candy machine and the handing out of Disney lollipops to wrap up the parade. Props to the castmember who has to pedal the length of the parade. \nSpeaking of candy...that's the No. 1 draw to my kids. I've seen some advice boards suggesting for families to have a good time and not miss anything from this event to avoid the candy line temptation. \nI say, let your kids lead you and you won't have a bad time. Plus, there's nothing like a hunt for an elusive box of Dots to make the candy line an adventure. To be sure, Dots are kind of like the Wonka Bar with the Golden Ticket. \nIf it hadn't been for the kids, I might not have enjoyed the fireworks while riding Goofy's Barnstormer roller coaster. I felt like Snoopy's World War I Flying Ace in “It’s the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown.” \nAnd for kids whose bedtime is normally around 8 p.m., the candy energy coupled with people energy made the 11:30 p.m. exeunt one in which I wasn't carrying one or two sleeping children. \nIt's a Halloween miracle. \nIf you go: \nWHAT: Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party, an after-hours, separate ticket event at Magic Kingdom theme park. \nWHEN: 7 p.m.-midnight on Sept. 15, 18, 20, 22, 25 and 27; Oct. 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 23, 25, 27 and 29; and Nov. 1. (The Oct. 31 party is sold out.) \nWHERE: Magic Kingdom, off Interstate 4, southwest of Orlando \nCOST: Between $68 and $79, depending on date (between $63 and $74 for ages 3-9). In general, the less expensive dates are in September. \nCALL: 407-824-4321", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T23:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T23:56:34.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
