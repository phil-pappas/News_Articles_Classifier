The activities on offer at the Kids Clubs have also been enhanced and will include more local arts and crafts, treasure hunts, natural trails and things like tree planting, where children can learn about the environment and get a certificate of ownership for their tree. They can even come back to see how it grows over the years.\n“We are one of the largest resort operators in the world and with more than 100 beautiful resorts across Asia Pacific, we wanted to help our members have a better stay and take the work out of their planning,” said Javier Cedillo-Espin, Senior Vice President Loyalty and Guest Experience. “We wanted to focus on a program of rewards and inclusions that will give our members tangible and meaningful benefits that help them get more of the good things in life.\n“Many of our members are business travellers who are frequently away from their families, so this program gives them something special they can share with their loved ones during a resort holiday to create lifetime memories.”\nDepending on their status level, there are other inclusions such as premium high-speed wifi for as many devices as they like including for their family members, early check-in and late check-out, upgrades for gold and platinum members, a dedicated MyHost to take care of all their arrangements during their stay and, for platinum members, the ability to extend their privileges to a family member or friend staying at the same resort.\n“This program is about more than just a few simple benefits – we have also changed the essence of how we cater to and look after our loyalty members and I believe the MyResort offerings will help set Le Club AccorHotels apart from its competitors,” continued Mr Cedillo-Espin.\nLe Club AccorHotels is free to join and includes more than 2800 participating hotels worldwide in 92 countries across the Sofitel, Pullman, MGallery, The Sebel, Novotel, Mercure, Adagio, ibis, ibis Styles and Thalassa Sea & Spa brands. Benefits include a VIP welcome on arrival, exclusive offers throughout the year, advance access to discounts of up to 50% several times a year, as well as a range of exclusive private events such as concerts, sporting shows, celebrity events and more. Best of all, if you stay with AccorHotels just once a year your points will never expire.\nLe Club AccorHotels was named the Best Hotel Loyalty Program for 2015 in the prestigious Freddie Awards for Asia Pacific/Oceania/Middle East/Europe and Africa and also was voted as having the best hotel loyalty program promotion for the year.\nAccorHotels is a Group united by a shared passion for hospitality and driven by a shared promise to make everyone Feel Welcome.\nOver 180,000 women and men in almost 3,800 AccorHotels establishments look after thousands of guests every day in 94 countries.\nAccorHotels is the world’s leading hotel operator and offers its customers, partners and employees:\n– its dual expertise as a hotel operator and franchisor (HotelServices) and a hotel owner and investor (HotelInvest);\n– a large portfolio of internationally renowned brands covering the full spectrum, with luxury (Sofitel, Pullman, MGallery, Grand Mercure, The Sebel), midscale (Novotel, Suite Novotel, Mercure, Mama Shelter, Adagio) economy (ibis, ibis Styles, ibis budget, adagio access and hotelF1) establishments;\n– a powerful marketplace and loyalty program Le Club AccorHotels\n– almost half a century of commitment to corporate citizenship and solidarity with the PLANET 21 program.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T21:24:09.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
