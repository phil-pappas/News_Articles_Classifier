This amounts to a total annual cost of nearly £98.6bn in the UK. Infamous incidents such as Morrisons’ insider fraud in 2014 and T-Mobile’s customer records selling made the fraud threat extremely real to the UK public and organisations. As technology becomes more advanced, inevitably fraud schemes are becoming more complex. Hence the question arises: in the face of an ever-evolving crime environment, how do you as a company director fulfil your duty to prevent fraud? Tech-savvy organisations share intelligence fast via internal databases There is no need for alarm, but it is imperative to stay aware of trends and implement solutions to help reduce the risk. Consider the experiences of some leading UK organisations. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and British Telecom (BT) embrace technology, fighting crime with centralised systems that record information about fraud and other crime. This is analysed and transformed into meaningful intelligence which allows these organisations to spot trends and connections between incidents to assist in preventing fraud from reoccurring. Alerts are automatically triggered by certain events, providing time advantage over perpetrators. Technology and intelligence become integral parts of the fraud-prevention process. But why not take it further? When it comes to intelligence, more is better. Technology-savvy organisations share intelligence quickly between each other via a central database to fight against fraudulent activities. By building a culture of fraud intelligence sharing you can reduce fraud and deliver financial benefits far greater than the cost of inflicted fraud. • For more information contact info@abmsoftware.com or visit www.abmsoftware.com • This article was originally produced and published by Business Reporter.
