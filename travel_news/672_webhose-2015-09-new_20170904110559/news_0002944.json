A 98-year old US woman demanded an apology from American Airlines as she alleges that her attendant abandoned her in the luggage claims. While another incident on a KLM flight involves a Scottish man who tried to open the planeâ€™s door at 30,000 feet, mistaking it for the loo entrance. He was fined of 600 Euros and banned from traveling with the airline for five years.\nNow the stories with erratic passengers and irresponsible crew members are rapidly increasing in the airline sector and especially in long-haul flights. Alcohol abuse is something that has lead to a number of airline brawls in the recent past and continues to be a threat to the crew members of any airline serving alcohol on board.\nHowever, the case of the 98-year old woman is something very inhuman and calls for a serious investigation from the AA officials. Rosario Sanchez, who is relatively in good shape to avail a flight to meet her daughter, complains that she was left strapped in a wheelchair at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport. She demands an apology from the airline.\nIn the incident involving the Scottish passenger, James Gray, the airline staff accused him of trying to open the door of the plane. However, he claimed that he only touched the handle confusing it to be the toilet door. This called for a huge trouble for the passenger and he had to pay his dues. He was taken to a nearby detention centre where he spent the night before he was fined 434 pounds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T20:06:40.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
