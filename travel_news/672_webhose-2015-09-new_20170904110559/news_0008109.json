But according to research by the Energy Saving Trust, 60 per cent of us are making at least one basic error when it comes to setting the thermostat that controls the temperature inside our homes. And it’s costing us money. So, let’s bust three of the most common thermostat myths and get you back in control and knocking money off your annual energy bill. Turning the thermostat up when it’s cold outside . Fifty two percent of people do this, but the whole point of a thermostat is to maintain the desired temperature inside, regardless of what the weather is doing outside. If you do turn up the thermostat when it’s cold outside, you’ll probably end up too hot, having wasted energy in the process. Meanwhile, turning your thermostat up from 21C to 22C could cost you up to £90 a year. Turning up the thermostat to heat the room more quickly . Thirty five per cent of us routinely do this. If you’ve just come home to a cold house it might seem reasonable to crank up the thermostat. But that won’t get you feeling comfortable any quicker. Your thermostat doesn’t operate like pressing down on a car accelerator – it has no control over the speed at which your house heats up, it simply sets the final temperature. All that setting it at maximum will achieve is an uncomfortably warm house and higher energy bills. Believing that leaving the thermostat set low and keeping the heating on constantly is more efficient than turning it on and off . Thirty eight per cent of us believe this to be true, but all it actually achieves is an empty home being heated when there is no-one around to feel the benefit. And when you are inside it’s always going to be too cold. It’s far better to use a thermostat programmer to control the timing of your heating – keeping you cosy when you are at home, and saving you money when you're not. Saving grace: don't waste money on heating an empty home Photo: Getty Bear in mind that it will take longer for your home to heat up on colder days, so set your central heating controls accordingly. Choose a cold evening and time how long it takes for your house to reach a comfortable temperature – this is the warm-up time. Then turn the heating off and time how long it takes before you get uncomfortably cold – this is the cool-down time. Now set your timers to allow for both and you’ll be in better control of the temperature of your home. HOW BEING IN CONTROL SAVES YOU MONEY Installing and correctly using a room thermostat and thermostatic radiator valves can shave between £80 and £165 off your annual energy bill. Fitting a hot water tank insulation jacket will typically reduce your hot water costs by £35 each year. Turning your room thermostat down by just one degree could save up to £90 annually, and reduce your carbon emissions by up to 360kg. • Learn about smart meters and find out how you can save money and time to spend on the things you love", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T01:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T22:45:36.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
