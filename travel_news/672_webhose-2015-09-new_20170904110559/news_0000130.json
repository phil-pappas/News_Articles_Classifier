Typically the fair is ten days but in reality, traders arrive earlier than the start date. The program for tourists starts from 18th and will conclude on 25th. So it really depends on your interest - if you're looking for cultural programs, 25th is still good. However, if the idea is to have a leisurely visit, my suggestion would be Chandrabhaga. I've been to Jhalrapatan and Jhalawar area and it is as such a lot less touristy than Pushkar. If you arrive on say 24th in that area, you could spend time checking out the local temples (3 major ones in Jhalrapatan alone) plus the fort of Gagron and then visit the fair.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T15:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T15:58:33.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
