Laugh. Always. Bad things are going to happen...we had our bikes stolen, I lost my wallet on a trip to London....s*** is going to happen and you just have to greet it with a smile.\n2. Be vocal with one another. Make sure you know what each other want to do when you visit a city/location/go to an event etc.\n3. Remain positive and always try to lift up the other person no matter what.\n4. Also remember to spend some time apart. No matter how much you love someone, you're bound to want space at some point - especially when you're together 24/7.\nEven if it is just a couple hours where I go to the gym and Alex does some yoga at home, it is super important to have that alone time.\nMake local friends and spend time with them. Man time and woman time are imperative.
