Barsham Barn: the complex of converted barns can be hired in various configurations, making them suitable for groups of different sizes This makes the barns ideal for a large reunion or special celebration - but equally good for a small group of family or friends, as each property feels private and secluded, with its own well-defined garden area and living space. Location: 8/10 With views of cultivated fields, meadows, woodland and the pretty, medieval church of All Saints, Barsham Barns has a decidedly rural setting. The best of Norfolk’s sandy beaches (Holkham and Wells-next-the-Sea) lie within a 15-minute drive, while Burnham Market is eight miles away. The Slipper Chapel, a pilgrimage site since the 14th century, is half a mile to the north-east. The half-timbered village of Little Walsingham, with its shrine and evocative ruined abbey (walsinghamabbey.com) is also close by. Style & character: 8/10 Thoughtfully converted by the owner-architect, modern layers of cement and render have been removed from interior walls to reveal the mellow chalk, flint and red-brick below. Old beams and rafters remain in situ, enhanced by a stylish, minimalist mix of plain but bold colours, striking pictures and contemporary furniture. Barsham Barn: Great Eastern Barn has ample entertaining space Ceilings are lofty and beamed; lighting is soft and atmospheric; sofas are deep and cosy. Subtle influences add individuality to each barn: beds and curtains in Long Meadow have a French feel; High Barsham has a dash of Moroccan; and rustic Great East Barn is painted in creamy clunch. Wood-burning stoves and underfloor heating make the barns as good for autumn and winter breaks as for sunny, summer holidays. Facilities: 8/10 Kitchens are equipped for large-scale catering and mostly open-plan. There is a communal table tennis and table football room, plus a spa pool and steam room (bookable for two hour-long sessions per property, per day). You can arrange for meal delivery or a private chef, but you should book in advance. Value for money: 7/10 Little Barsham (sleeping four) costs from £780 per week in January; rising to £1,220 in high. The Great East Barn (sleeping 14) costs from £2,685 per week in January, rising to £3,890 in high. Cheaper short breaks are available outside peak times. Family-friendly: 8/10 Children of all ages are welcome Eating Local produce available from Walsingham Farms Shop in Little Walsingham. Access for guests with disabilities?
