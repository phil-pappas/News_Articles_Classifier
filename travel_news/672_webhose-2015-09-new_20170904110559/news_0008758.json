So they seek out faster solutions to their health issues in countries where they conclude it will be safe to do so.\nThird and fourth on the index were Israel and Singapore.\nA good friend from Winnipeg recently contracted what is commonly known as flesh-eating disease from one of the countries he visited on a recent holiday. He credits the superior professional care he received in Singapore for saving his life.\nIt was a personal observation, but everything he saw and experienced related to health care convinced him it was the country to go to for those who seek these services away from Canada.\nA number of western countries such as France, Germany and Italy were in the Top 10 as well, but for less expensive services a number of other countries such as the Philippines are also rated highly.\nWith $100 billion at stake, it is not surprising many more countries are promoting themselves as medical-tourism destinations.\nWhile many of the countries have joined the race to attract health care visitors, it is important those seeking services do significant amount of research to ensure the country they choose is truly certified to perform the services they require.\nCountries such as Mexico, Costa Rica, and a few Latin American countries tend to specialize in cosmetic or bariatric surgery.\nDeveloping specialty services has become a part of the marketing plan for many of the countries seeking to separate themselves from the competition.\nMany countries will become a medical-tourism destination for a region, as opposed to the world.\nSouth Africa, for example, has one of the best health-care systems in their region and attracts patients from the easily accessible nations nearby, such as Botswana, Zambia, and Tanzania.\nTied to this development of specialized health care is a sector of the industry that has come to be defined as circumvention tourism.\nA service may be illegal in a home country, but fully available at a different destination where it flourishes, because of the numbers of people willing to seek these out at any cost.\nMany are aware of countries that allow doctor-assisted suicides or cancer treatments that are banned for lack of test results at home.\nExperimental fertility treatments and non-approved medicines are often sought out by the desperate ones hoping for a miracle.\nThe most popular of services in the circumvention-tourism sector are for those seeking abortions.\nMany countries such as Ireland and Poland have had restrictive abortion laws for a long time. Nearby European countries were initially the main beneficiaries for these services, but around the world this side of tourism has been flourishing as well.\nWith Canada rated so highly on these reported quality studies, many have suggested that Canadian provinces, who essentially control health care services here, should be working towards becoming the \"Mayo Clinics of the North.\"\nThere have been a number of proposals and studies done to evaluate the potential for individual provinces move in that direction.\nSo far, there has been a reluctance to take the next step. It would constitute a major change in public policy, and many fear it would change the dynamic of our health care from what it is today, to a for-profit system.\nSignificantly more investment would be required to insure our own wait times and demands for expanded services at home were improved before such a direction is likely to be taken.\nIn the meantime many Manitobans and Canadians will continue to seek health care abroad, for the health services they want faster, or more specialized.\n\nIf you have travel questions or comments email me at pradinukr@shaw.ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T12:14:01.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
