The workstations will support an existing Evana assembly and test system that produces electronic actuators for a transmission.\nThe new workstations will provide automatic and semi-automatic operations. One of the operations involves pressing magnets into cartridge forks. Another operation involves installing gears and seals into the encoder. In addition, gears and shafts will be pressed into the housings. Individual components will be manually loaded. Vision inspection, along with servo press force and distance data, will be captured and archived as part of the customer's SCADA quality control system. The workstations are scheduled for a December 2015 delivery.\n\"The Evana workstations provide a solid platform for the assembly and testing of critical part production of an automobile transmission,\" said Randy Wire , general manager of Evana Automation Specialists. \"The solution also provides effective quality control measurement for part data.\"\nEvana, a subsidiary of Phillips Service Industries (PSI) , utilizes diverse technologies to specialize in motion control, robotics integration, welding integration and system architecture by linking production equipment, material handling systems, data collection, networking, as well as computer software and hardware into flexible, unified technology.
