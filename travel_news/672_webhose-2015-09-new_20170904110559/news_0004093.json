The return flight, EK397 will depart Phuket at 9:30am and arrives in Dubai the same day at 1:20pm. \nEK394 will operate three times per week and will depart Dubai at 8:05pm and arrive at Phuket at 5:10am the following day. The return flight, EK395 will depart Phuket at 7:10am and arrives in Dubai the same day at 11am. \nIn addition to Phuket, Emirates flies 42 times a week to Bangkok, and from December 1, four of the six daily flights to Bangkok will be served by an A380. The airline also recently announced a codeshare agreement with Bangkok Airways, which added 19 routes across a number of Southeast Asian cities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T23:52:54.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
