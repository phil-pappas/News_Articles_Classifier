(Vidya Subramanian) While she often makes news for her fashion endeavours, Masaba Gupta chose to keep low key when it came to her wedding to producer Madhu Mantena. Just a few months after they made their relationship public, the couple got engaged in an intimate ceremony, and soon, in June this year, got their marriage registered. Now, after five months, they are set to celebrate their nuptials with fanfare in November. Here, the designer candidly talks about her marriage, and more. Your wedding celebration is happening in November. Why did you opt for a gap between the wedding and the celebration? My mum (Neena Gupta; actor) has been in the US since July end, and she will be back only by end of this month. Also, we didn’t have a venue. I was very particular about the weather I wanted to get married in. It had to be winter. That’s why we did the wedding in June, took a gap, and planned to celebrate in November. What are you planning to wear at the functions? I’m working on something with Anamika Khanna for my reception. I’m very particular about not being in a heavy lehenga with heavy jewellery and make-up. I want to have a relaxed wedding. What brought you and Madhu together? Both of us come from very high-maintenance industries — fashion and films. There is a lot of work involved on a daily basis. So, the fact that we choose not to be affected by it after a certain time of the day is what brought us together. I think, initially, he thought that I would be someone completely engrossed in the industry, and one of those social fashionistas. I thought he is this producer, who would talk about films all the time. But when we came together, we realised that there are many other things that we like to do. Like just eat, or watch shows on TV. There wasn’t any news about your relationship with Madhu before you two walked into the Queen (2014) party together. I don’t like the whole thing of, “Oh, I am going to announce it today, and I’m not going to talk about it”. I’m a normal girl, and Madhu is a normal guy. We were in a relationship, and when we went to the Queen party, we posed for photographs. I don’t know why people hide. I’m sure they have a reason, and a PR machinery behind it. But I didn’t want to be a person who would run and get into a car. Do you plan to collaborate with him in any capacity in the future? Madhu does a lot of interesting work, because he likes to develop content. That’s something that we might collaborate on, maybe, at a later stage. Also, it’s not just him. When he is working on a project, there are so many people involved, and I don’t want to come across as this boss’s wife. I am established in my own industry, and he is established in his. We don’t need to cross paths in our professional space. Popularity came very quickly to you. Did that add to the pressure? Yes, but in a good way. My consistency led to my popularity. I mean what I do — prints — is not something you need to master. It’s not rocket science. But I took the pressure, and kept coming back every season. If you don’t, then you will take two seasons off, and expect people to still remember you in third. But, [by then] nobody cares. You have to be in people’s faces to establish yourself. And that’s what happened. Is it important for designers to be part of a fashion week every season? It helps. Having said that, I don’t think it’s important. What matters is to do something that is big enough or relevant enough every season. It could be the launch of something new, where there is visibility in a big enough way. With so many fashion weeks in the country, there has been an influx of designers. While some are good, some aren’t. Does that affect the reputation of the industry? It does. It affects our veterans. Today, if you have a little bit of monetary help, you can be at any fashion week in the country. For a lay person, everyone is a big designer, because it is easy to become a big designer nowadays. Three stars wear your clothes, you have a social media following of more than 10,000, and you are, apparently, the next big thing. I don’t understand this, because if you ask these designers to put a business model in place or how they plan to sustain their label for the next five years, they will run. That’s the challenge.
