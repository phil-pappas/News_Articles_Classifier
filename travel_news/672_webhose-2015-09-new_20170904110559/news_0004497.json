New York City's special narcotics prosecutor says Dr. Gerald Surya was arrested Thursday on 26 counts of criminal sale of a prescription. Prosecutors say Surya, who has an office at a medical facility at Kennedy Airport, wrote prescriptions for people who didn't need them. Authorities say none of the patients who bought the prescriptions were airline pilots. They say he charged $60 for a prescription, but increased the price to $100 after agents raided his office in July 2014. Prosecutors allege Surya often sold multiple prescriptions to patients for their families and friends. It was not immediately clear whether Surya had an attorney who could comment on his behalf.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T15:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T01:49:51.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
