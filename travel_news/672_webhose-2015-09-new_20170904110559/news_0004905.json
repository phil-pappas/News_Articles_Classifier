The glow of the instruments and the city lights below, luminous against a dark sky, have etched beautiful vivid memories for many. Entering \"The Gatsby\" penthouse in downtown Toronto evokes that same childlike wonder.\nWith the release of The Gatsby , Sky View Suites - torontofurnishedrentals.com (the company hired to decorate and manage the suite) has brought the furnished rental market in Toronto to its highest point ever. High atop the 79 floors of the tallest residential building in Canada , it is no wonder that stepping into this luxury 2,100 square foot penthouse is reminiscent of flight.\nThis penthouse suite is situated in the heart of downtown Toronto (at the intersection of Yonge Street and College Street), and comes with all perks one would expect. The elegant lobby houses a 24 hour concierge, and at the base of the building is the Hard Candy gym (Madonna's own franchise). The suite itself has two bedrooms, each with their own walk-in closets and their own luxurious en-suite bathrooms. The master en-suite has a double vanity, a separate deep soaker tub and a water closet. The master bedroom also has a soaring view of its own, with a panoramic wall of floor to ceiling windows.\nThe living area is open concept and combines the dining room, living room and kitchen. The Gatsby's extravagance was designed for entertaining and impressing your entourage, with expensive finishes, ample space, dining for up to 14 people, two fireplaces and the best views in the city. With a private two car garage, exotic cars are welcome.\nExecutives, athletes, movie stars or anyone wealthy enough to afford it can land The Gatsby for a mere $12,500 per month. Fully equipped, all you need is your Louis Vuitton bags. As an added touch, Sky View Suites welcomes their guests with a fresh bouquet of daises.
