The application lists the businesses participating in the fair, as well as the programme, hall map and services. It helps fair-goers to plan their day and find the most interesting sights, stands and programme venues. The software is easy to use and works offline. \nThe Messukeskus application can be used at all events organised by Messukeskus. It is available for download at the App Store and Google Play stores. Since iOS and Android phones form the majority of smart phones in Finland, most applications are tailored for these devices. – Adding a digital dimension improves the efficiency of fairs. The mobile application combines real and digital encounters, simultaneously bringing these two rapidly growing media within the grasp of customers, says Maria Mroue, Marketing and Communications Director at Messukeskus Helsinki, Expo and Convention Centre. – The application is also an ecological choice by Messukeskus, because it reduces the need for printed fair catalogues and fair magazines. We wish to protect the environment at all stages of event production, Mroue explains. The application also provides additional visibility for corporate customers and other partners of Messukeskus. A company participating in a fair can send personalised messages to the phones of everyone in the vicinity of its stand. For example, messages can include information, offers or an invitation to participate in a draw as a fair-goer is approaching a stand. These messages can also be used to collect contact information. They are relayed using Beacon and Bluetooth technologies. The Messukeskus app was built by mobile service provider Qvik. The map application was built together with Nimble Devices. Messukeskus Helsinki enables profitable face-to-face meetings in fairs, congresses and other events. Exhibitions and fairs are Finland's sixth largest media. In terms of effectiveness, they are the most profitable, the richest in experiences and the most social of all media. In 2014, Messukeskus organised a hundred fair events and more than 1,500 meetings and congresses. These events attracted 9,400 exhibitors and more than 1.1 million visitors.
