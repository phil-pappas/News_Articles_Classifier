Can you pull off edgy thick rims? Is an oval or square design more flattering? How are you meant to make these decisions when you have to squint to see yourself in the mirror? It’s all too easy to spend hours mulling over the options. If you’re like most people, you probably devote next to no time to considering the lenses which are going to go inside. “It’s really important to people what their frame looks like cosmetically, but they don’t worry too much about the lenses, as long as they can see through them,” notes Andy Hepworth, dispensing optician and professional relations manager for Essilor. However, you could be missing a trick, because lens technology is so advanced now, you can choose ones which are perfectly tailored to you. Here are the key things you should consider: Your lifestyle Do you spend hours glued to a computer screen? Do you drive? Are you constantly dashing in and out of the office? Whatever your typical day looks like, you can choose lenses that are perfect for your needs. For example, all Crizal UV lenses are scratch-resistant and protect against glare which is great for night time driving as they reduce the glare and dazzle from the headlights of oncoming vehicles. Crizal Prevencia also filters out harmful blue-violet light delivering protection all day; while Crizal Transitions quickly change from clear to dark when exposed to UV light. “For many people it’s ideal to have two or more pairs of glasses with different lenses to suit their needs,” says Hepworth. Your age “From the age of around 45, people start noticing presbyopia,” notes Hepworth. “This is where you begin to struggle to focus on things close up, even when wearing the glasses or contact lenses you’ve worn for many years, you may also find you hold reading materials at arms length.” If that applies to you, he recommends asking your optician about varifocal lenses (where their strength varies from the top of the lens to the bottom), which will reduce the workload on your eyes when reading. Your look “Lenses with anti-reflective coating look much nicer because you don’t get as much light bouncing off them,” says Hepworth. Crizal UV lenses all come with this technology as standard. If you have a stronger prescription, which may have meant thicker lenses in the past, you can talk to your optician about opting for ones with slimmer edges that will sit more neatly inside your frames. Bye-bye bottle-thick glasses. Your budget The higher-tech the lenses you opt for, the higher the price tag is likely to be. So set out your budget with your optician from the outset. However, Hepworth notes that sometimes a bigger initial outlay can save you money in the long run. “The top end of the Crizal UV range, Crizal Prevencia and Crizal-UV Forte, come with a two-year no-quibble guarantee against scratches.” So they are well worth the investment.
