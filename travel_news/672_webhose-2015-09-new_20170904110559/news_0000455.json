Those trips that you think about, discuss endlessly and plan to do in the ultimate style, whether it is an expedition to Antarctica or travelling across continents on the Trans-Siberian Express. As a leader in luxury travel, Abercrombie & Kent was the first company to offer Kenyan safaris in lavish comfort in 1962. More than 50 years later, A&K takes in 100 countries on all seven continents, using its expertise and legendary dedication to service to ensure every trip taken goes beyond expectations. Tailor-made tours, group journeys and villa and chalet holidays cater for a huge variety of customers looking to explore the world in comfort. And then there are those other trips, the dreamed-of itineraries, the once-in-a-lifetime experiences and the desire to do it all in the best style. A&K offers some fantastic holidays that fall into this category too, taking care of every element to ensure that your dream trip is one you will truly remember forever. But how do you choose which adventure to take? When it comes to inspirational journeys, why not add one of these suggested trips to your dream list of places to visit? Polar Cruising, Antarctica When it comes to visiting the icy expanse of the two Polar Regions – Antarctica and the Arctic – the best way to explore is by boat. Extreme landscapes, isolated communities and an amazing array of wildlife combine to make these remote corners of the world a truly special place to explore. In Alaska, there is the chance to spot polar bears, while Gentoo penguins and wandering albatross populate the Antarctic. These are the inhospitable lands of explorers and you can experience it all from the comfort of a luxuriously-appointed ship in the company of historians, biologists and ornithologists who share your on-shore adventures and give illuminating talks in the evenings. There is even a professional photographer on board each cruise to help you capture the wonder of the surrounding landscapes. A 15-day trip to Antarctica costs from £10,020pp* Gorilla Trekking, Uganda Referred to by Winston Churchill as the “pearl of Africa”, Uganda delights all who visit with its lush forests, soaring mountain ranges and incredible variety of wildlife. You can spend part of your holiday spotting the Big Five, then ascend into the misty mountains to come face to face with humans’ closest living relatives. The aptly-named Bwindi Impenetrable Forest is the home of around 700 mountain gorillas and A&K guides are experts in tracking them so you can quietly watch them in their natural habitat. Stay at the beautiful Sanctuary Gorilla Forest Camp and the primates could even turn up on your doorstep. More than 1,000 species of birds, mountain lions and chimpanzees just add to the amazing array of wildlife in Uganda. A 5 day trip to Uganda including gorilla trekking costs from £3,025pp* Around the World by Private Jet When it comes to the trip of a lifetime, nothing compares to being whisked around the world on your own private jet. The ultimate luxurious experience eschews the inconveniences of travelling on public planes and can see you touch down in some of the most remote parts of the world. A&K’s private jet is a Boeing 757 with seats that convert into lie-flat beds, ensuring the utmost comfort as you are whisked from one spectacular destination to another. Swoop in to islands, savannahs and the Amazon, fly across Africa and explore India on a memorable tour which will set a new bar for luxury holidays. A 15-day trip through India by Private Jet costs from £18,950pp* Trans-Siberian Express, Russia Stepping aboard the Golden Eagle Trans-Siberian Express is like travelling back in time. A sumptuous hotel on wheels with ensuite cabins, excellent service and a turn-of-the-century-style restaurant, it is the most luxurious way to discover the extreme landscapes of Russia. And that’s what it’s all about – the theatre that happens beyond the window panes. Snaking across the country in a cocoon of luxury, you will have plenty of opportunities to alight and discover your surroundings from Moscow to ancient Lake Baikal and coastal Vladivostok – all with expert help from your tour manager and the chance to sample truly unique experiences such as a private concert in the middle of Siberia. A 14 day trip to Russia on board the Trans-Siberian Express costs from £8,550pp* Darwin’s Laboratory, Galápagos Islands They are described as Charles Darwin’s “living laboratory” and there are few destinations in the world as special as the Galápagos Islands. Sail in the wake of the HMS Beagle and discover the exceptional wildlife that inspired Darwin’s theory of evolution. Long separated from mainland and predators, giant tortoises, blue-footed boobies, iguanas and sea lions remain fearless when faced with humans and as you hop from island to island you’ll discover how they have each evolved to suit their surroundings. A&K uses expert local guides to ensure you are given the introduction to this magical destination and its wondrous wildlife that it truly deserves. A 15 day trip to the Galapagos costs from £4,495pp* Northern Lights There are few sights as magical as the Aurora Borealis, those ethereal streaks across the sky glowing bright green and deep, pulsating indigo. And the beautiful phenomena can be seen from a variety of northerly destinations, from Scandinavia to Alaska, ensuring equally inspiring vistas and experiences by day, before heading out after dark, eyes turned skyward. The world is currently experiencing an active period in the 11-year solar cycle, but you still need expert guides and good planning to ensure you spot the celestial wonder and learn all about how it is created.
