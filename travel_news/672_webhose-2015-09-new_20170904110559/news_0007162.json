The partnership is an innovative way for the brand to display its care for patrons and could attract potential consumers who need access to the area’s array of renowned surgeons. “At The Peninsula Beverly Hills we endeavor to take the guest experience to the next level,” said Jessica Wong, public relations manager at Peninsula Beverly Hills. “This latest partnership further enhances our commitment to offering our guests exclusive access to the exceptional experiences of the finest quality. Our guests can rest assured that with just one call, they will receive the best medical service any time of day.” \nYour health comes first BHMC is a membership organization that connects its members with specialists and other superior medical care and treatment options that they would not otherwise have access to. The concierge includes a carefully selected and reviewed group of distinguished doctors, surgeons and other medical professionals, ensuring members excellent service and care. \nThe Peninsula Beverly Hills front \nFor the partnership, the hotel and BHMC will make all arrangements for guests to receive necessary procedures and treatments, as the BHMC network includes everything from dermatologists, plastic surgeons and beauty counselors to neurologists, orthopedic doctors and other specialists in more urgent realms. \nGuests will also be provided with complimentary round-trip transportation in one of the Peninsula’s famous Rolls-Royce or other luxury vehicles for medical appointments that are scheduled anywhere in Beverly Hills as well as Century City, which borders 90210 to the west. Additionally, special rates are available for those whose needs will require an extended stay of at least a month. \nDue to the number of prominent surgeons, particularly cosmetic surgeons, in the city – a partial result of the high concentration of wealth and celebrities living in it or the surrounding area – Beverly Hills is an apt branch for Peninsula to select to go above and beyond in providing its guests with great care. Individuals in need of the best healthcare available may find themselves heading to the Beverly Hills area anyway, so the partnership between Peninsula and BHMC gives them a big incentive to stay at the hotel. \nPeninsula Beverly Hills grand deluxe room \nThe partnership will also relax guests without pressing health needs, who can be assured the hotel will take care of them in the event of a severe illness or other emergency. Great healthcare is a unique way for a hotel to improve guest experience, with mobile check-ins, transportation, spas, marquee restaurants and, of course, employee knowledge and service being more common. \nBedside manner This is not the first time that Peninsula has shown its concern for people’s well being. \nPeninsula is also looking to raise awareness about breast cancer through a new initiative that will remind its consumers to think pink. \n“The Art of Pink” will bring specially commissioned pink-inspired artwork by internationally acclaimed artists to Peninsula hotels throughout the world this October in recognition of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Through the initiative, Peninsula will bring attention to the fight to end cancer and reaffirm the brand’s commitment to this cause ( see story ). \nThe hotel chain has previously looked to other methods to improve the health of its guests as well. \nBeginning in March, it began to relaunch its wellness programs across all properties, redirecting attention to the program. \nPeninsula opened wellness centers, focused on sleep patterns of stressed guests, created a spa experience focused on natural products, offered massage opportunities and provided healthy dining options to improve the health of its patrons. The surge of healthy lifestyle options across Peninsula properties reflects upon the brand’s dedication to guests and their lifestyle choices ( see story ). \nStill, the partnership with BHMC nevertheless stands out as a particularly noteworthy measure. “There are no plans at the moment for healthcare-focused partnerships at the other Peninsula hotels,” Ms. Wong said. “But, t his partnership is just as suitable for planned trips to pursue medical care as it is for unexpected medical attention. It is an extension of our existing offering of having a house doctor on site.” \nFinal Take Forrest Cardamenis, editorial assistant on Luxury Daily, New York", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T17:19:30.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
