Each is $18 for Marcus JCC members and $24 for nonmembers.\nThe most expensive tickets for the festival — $26 for members, $31 for nonmembers — are Saturday night appearance by Judy Blume on Nov. 7 and Mitch Album on Nov. 14, but tickets to those events include first-edition copies of their new novels.\nSome of the festival events are free, including:\nA conversation at The Temple on Nov. 9 between Ambassador Dennis Ross and Emory professor Ken Stein about Ross’ new book on the Middle East, “Doomed to Succeed.” A Kristallnacht commemoration speech by Dr. Ruth Westheimer at the Besser Holocaust Memorial Garden on Nov. 10. A program Nov. 19 with two authors of history books, Harry Lembeck of “Taking on Theodore Roosevelt” and Robert Weintraub of “No Better Friend.” Appearances by local authors Mike Wien (“The Specific Edge”) on Nov. 8, Chana Shapiro and Meta Miller (“Fruitfly Rabbi”) on Nov. 12, and Josh Levs (“All In”) on Nov. 22. Other headliners at the festival include Arlene Alda with her husband, actor Alan Alda, a former festival headliner himself, talking about her “Just Kids From the Bronx” on Nov. 15; Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz on Nov. 21 (your $24 or $29 ticket includes his latest book on Abraham); and Faye and Jonathan Kellerman and their son, Jesse, presenting Faye’s “The Theory of Death” and Jonathan and Jesse’s “The Golem of Paris” on Nov. 12.\nThe Esther G. Levine community read this year is Westheimer’s “The Doctor Is In: Dr. Ruth on Love, Life, and Joie de Vivre.”\nThe prologue to the festival could be the most interesting night of all: Knesset member and historian Michael Oren speaks at Atlanta Jewish Academy on Oct. 7 about “Ally,” his headline-making memoir about his time as Israel’s ambassador to the United States from 2009 to 2013. Tickets to Oren’s talk are $18 for JCC members and $24 for nonmembers.\nThe festival for the second year is supporting the Atlanta Jewish Coalition for Literacy with the book donation program Project GIVE. Starting Oct. 1, bins will be available at the JCC’s front desk to accept donations of new or gently used secular books for use in tutoring kindergartners through third-graders in public schools. The children get to keep the books.\nLast year Project GIVE collected more than 2,000 books.", "external_links": ["http://www.atlantajcc.org/bookfestival%20and%20678-812-4005"], "published": "2015-09-17T04:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T23:48:30.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
