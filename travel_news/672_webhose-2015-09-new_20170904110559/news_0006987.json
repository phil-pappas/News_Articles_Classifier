There was Darian Stewart's game-saving interception to seal that victory. There was Talib's other interception in Week 2 at Kansas City. And Brandon Marshall's forced fumble that was recovered and returned by Bradley Roby. And, please, don't forget Harris' interception.\nThere was Roby's acrobatic interception at Detroit. And David Bruton's acrobatic interception soon after. And Shaquil Barrett's strip sack. And the list, after only three games, goes on and on and on.\nThe Broncos' deep and destructive defense that reared its head in the preseason continues to wreak havoc on the league, one takeaway at a time, one sack at a time, one game-altering play at a time.\nNot since Pittsburgh in 2010 has a team recorded at least 10 takeaways and 10 sacks in the first three weeks. The Broncos have 10 and 11, respectively.\n\"I give us an A+,\" Harris said of the Broncos' victory in Detroit. \"We continued to get these turnovers every week, and that's huge.\"\nConsistency was preached, but met with skepticism from the start, many wondering if the defense, while deep, could continue to disrupt at this pace. But the team's reliance on its defense for three consecutive victories has converted the skeptics. Denver's 10 takeaways has led to 31 points, nearly 42 percent of their total.\nAdvertisement The Broncos are averaging 3.3 takeaways per game, putting them on pace to finish the season with about 53. The 2014 Broncos recorded only 25, the 15th-most in the league, and no team in the past 25 years has recorded more than 49, a mark set by the 2000 Ravens.\n\"We constantly work on getting turnovers,\" Bruton said. \"Our scoop-and-score drills, interceptions, tip drills — everything like that. We work on that every week, so just to have those things come to fruition is amazing.\nSports Poll - Broncos catch Who had the better overhead catch in Week 3?

But much of it goes to defensive coordinator Wade Phillips' 3-4 defense.\nThe system emphasizes aggression up front, freeing up the line and the edge rushers to attack the quarterback. It requires the middle linebackers to both tackle and drop in coverage and allows the defensive backs to, as Harris says, \"be on an island.\"\n\"I like it like that,\" said Harris, who played man-to-man on Golden Tate on Sunday and held him to 57 yards on five receptions. \"It's good to have that trust from the coaches.\"\nDenver Broncos cornerback Chris Harris (25) tackles Golden Tate (15) of the Detroit Lions during the first half of play at Ford Field. The Detroit Lions hosted the Denver Broncos in NFL week 3 action on Sept. 27, 2015. ( AAron Ontiveroz, The Denver Post ) Phillips' 3-4 puts a greater responsibility on cornerbacks to read and react on the fly, making communication vital in the defensive backfield. The Broncos revamped their defense in the summer of 2014, signing Ware, safety T.J. Ward and Talib, and a full season together has, as they expected, led to a smooth start this season — even with the new scheme.\n\"Guys are definitely taking it a lot more seriously,\" Bruton said. \"To know that we can win games and, especially throughout these last few weeks, being able to force 10 turnovers, we know what we're capable of, and we're just going to keep having that hunt and that hunger in us.\"\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or @NickiJhabvala", "external_links": ["http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/0927/20150927_093933_poll-dt.jpg", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/0927/20150927_085838_chris-harris.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-28T10:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T06:05:42.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
