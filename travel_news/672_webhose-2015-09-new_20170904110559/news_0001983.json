Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Sep 10, 2015 Amb. Yamina seen here in Kinigi/Musanze at the recent 11th Kwita Izina celebrations eTN   \nAfter just completing a successful 11th edition of Rwanda’s tourism and conservation showcase event, Kwita Izina, and meeting this correspondent yesterday morning at her office in Kigali on the 3rd floor of the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) Building, it appears that Ambassador Yamina will return to diplomatic service as the new High Commissioner of Rwanda to the Court of St. James, i.e., the United Kingdom. \nPrior to becoming the Head of Tourism and Conservation nearly two years ago, Amb. Yamina served as Rwanda’s High Commissioner to Kenya before taking over from Rica Rwigamba. \nRDB has over the past two years undergone some restructuring and in retrospect, when discussing various aspects of RDB’s operations yesterday, the cryptic message was that more change is on the way, clearly attributed to Amb. Yamina herself, something she could not reveal until the Rwandan cabinet office had made a formal announcement. \nWhile Rwanda’s Senate must still assent to the new appointment, this is largely expected to be a mere formality after the Rwandan cabinet had yesterday approved this and three other new ambassadorial appointments. Among those will be the first Rwandan resident ambassador to Angola, a new ambassador to the Kingdom of Belgium, and a new ambassador to Ethiopia. \nAmb. Yamina is also a member of the Board of Directors of RwandAir, where she currently serves as Vice Chairperson of the Board. It could, in view of the rapid developments of the past few hours, not be ascertained if she will remain on the board or step down to have her successor at RDB take over that position, too. \nAmb. Yamina yesterday spoke of both the successes as well as the challenges of both conservation and tourism - she looks after the combined portfolio at the Rwanda Development Board - while expressing her confidence that after bagging nearly US$305 million in revenues last year, 2015 will again see another rise in both numbers, as well as money earned from the sector. \nIt is expected that a replacement at RDB as new Chief Tourist Officer will be named very shortly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T08:13:58.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
