A spokesperson for Ingolstadt-based Audi confirms that this includes 1.42 million in western Europe , 577,000 in Germany , and nearly 13,000 Audis in the United States .\nA nonprofit environmental group, known as the International Council on Clean Transportation, uncovered this deception and on September 18, 2015 , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ordered Volkswagen to recall nearly 500,000 vehicles in the U.S. alone. The EPA alleges that company executives had lied to environmental regulators by rigging an emissions test, violating the Clean Air Act. Volkswagen initially blamed technical errors for the discrepancies found between their diesel vehicles' low emissions tests and higher emission levels on the road. It was found, however, that certain Volkswagen vehicles were equipped with illegal software that intentionally allowed them to evade emissions standards â€“ particularly for reducing smog during testing.\nVolkswagen is facing criminal investigation by the Justice Department's Environmental and Natural Resources Division. The Justice Department could impose fines as high as $37,500 for each vehicle-totaling as much as $18 billion across the U.S. A criminal investigation has also been launched by German prosecutors into former CEO Martin Winterkorn-who on Friday, September 25, 2015 , was replaced by Matthias Mueller .\nThe Audi cars that were affected by the recall include:\nA1, A3, A4, A5, & A6 Q3 Q5 TT Other Volkswagen vehicles included in the recall are:\nJetta (model year 2009-2015) Beetle (model year 2009-2015) Audi A3 (model years 2009-2015) Golf (model years 2009-2015) Passat (model years 2014-2015) Volkswagen will be required to fix the emissions system to comply with federal regulations and emissions standards. Since news of the Volkswagen's deception broke, its shares have plummeted by about a third.\nIf you purchased or leased a 2009-2015 model year Audi or Volkswagen from the recall list, it is important to speak to an experienced class action lawyer immediately.\nSeeger Weiss is a leader in consumer class action lawsuits.
