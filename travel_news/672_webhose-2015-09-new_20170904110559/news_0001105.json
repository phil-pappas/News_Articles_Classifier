This is great news for overseas travelers, who will be able to take advantage of a very favorable exchange rate to come on a vacation of a lifetime to South Africa. \nNow, more than ever, Southern Africa offers tremendous value for money and has become one of the greatest vacation values for international travelers. This means marketing opportunities aplenty for the astute marketer. SAA has developed the “Go See Southern Africa” campaign, to emphasise the great experiences and excellent value that abound for travel to Southern Africa. Fares from various cities in the United States have been lowered to offer even more value, so there is no better time for tourism companies and marketing representatives to market Southern Africa to people overseas. \nSouthern Africa offers no shortage of vacation options to suit every pocket and taste. Travelers are truly spoiled for choice from hotel and safari lodge accommodation, restaurants offering local and international cuisine, access to the Big Five wildlife and spectacular, breath-taking scenery. The area’s wine regions are noted and respected around the world for producing award-winning vintages, so there is truly something for everyone in this diverse region and no better time than the present to come and visit!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T00:25:46.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
