Other high-earning categories included service (#3), dining (#3), kid-friendly (#3), challenge (#4), on-mountain food (#4), character (#5) and grooming (#5).\nThe official results were released today on social media and on SKImag.com and will be published in SKI Magazine’s annual Resort Guide.The recognition is welcome news in Whistler, as the resort prepares for the upcoming winter season, and a year of milestones: the Resort Municipality of Whistler celebrates its 40th anniversary in 2015; and winter 2015/16 marks the 50th anniversary of Whistler Mountain and the 35th anniversary of Blackcomb Mountain.\n“This is exceptional news for Whistler,” said Barrett Fisher, Tourism Whistler’s President & CEO. “We think Whistler is a pretty special place, but we might be a little biased, because Whistler is our home. It is therefore truly an honor when our town is also recognized by our guests and industry.”\nWhen asked what sets Whistler apart from other leading destinations, Fisher says: “I think it is the combination of our two massive mountains, inviting village, electric energy, and warm, friendly people; all set in a stunning natural environment.”\nBut Fisher adds that Whistler would not be the destination it is today without the vision and leadership of business and government working together.“Whistler’s success is built on a foundation of strong resort-wide partners,” she said. “I would like to congratulate Whistler Blackcomb for its ski area leadership, along with all of our resort businesses who continually strive to exceed our guests’ expectations. As well, I would like to recognize the Resort Municipality of Whistler for its oversight of village and recreation amenities, and the Whistler Chamber of Commerce for its service excellence program. We truly have a great team.”\nSource:-SKI Magazine", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T06:04:11.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
