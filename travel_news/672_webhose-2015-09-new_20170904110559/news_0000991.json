The composites are widely used in hulls, decks, seats, ski boats, racing boats, masts and other structural components of recreational vessels.\nThe marine composites market is growing owing to the large demand for sailboats, yatch's in the leisure industry. The growth of the super-rich (High Net Worth Individuals- HNWI) and the expenditure on luxury shopping will see a rise in this sector. Due to this factor the industry is forecasted to rise in the coming years. Furthermore, the emerging technological advancements in the field of bio-plastics and auto clave pre-pregs is also steering this market.\nGlass fiber reinforced plastics had high demand till 2012 since they were cheaper compared to Carbon fiber composites. Carbon fiber composites are currently being used in sail boats, jet boats, cruise ships, powerboats. Amongst the resins - unsaturated polyesters are likely to be used in this industry. These materials are used in various parts of maritime vessel like interiors to furnitures. Resins are most likely to be used in smaller boats and the glass fiber and carbon fiber composites will be used mainly in larger recreational vessels. The key factor is to make light weight hulls and corrosion resistant.\nThe key regions with market opportunities in the new boat building industries are China , South Korea , and other oceanic regions. Asia Pacific has the highest growth rate for the Marine Composite Market. Although Europe has much potential but due to the high costs of styrene there has been much decline.\nDrivers\nThe innovation in material technology, Rising expense of consumers, the demand for new and improved speed boats, fuel efficiency are the major drivers of this industry segment.\nChallenges\nThe stringent regulations regarding styrene in Europe , high cost of manufacturing of carbon fiber composites, recycling and reparability issues, are some of the blockages that need to be overcome by this sector.\nThe report discusses the overall Global Marine Composite industry from 2014 to 2019. It gives a technological snapshot of the industry. It also discusses the market dynamics elaborately with drivers, issues and opportunities. It also discusses the quantitative segments, by market type and applications on a regional level quantifying the market estimation and forecast till 2019. The region wise break up covers Asia-Pacific , North America , Europe , South America , Middle East and Africa . It also gives a market estimation by product type – glass fiber composites, carbon fiber composites etc. The segmentation includes cruise ships, sail boats, power boats etc. The power boats segment has huge scope in this sector.\nThe report also provides the competitive landscape – most recent mergers and joint ventures and profiles the key players dominating the marine composite industry.\nThe key players are Du Pont, PEC, Aeromarine Industries Ltd., Janicki Industries, Marine Concepts, Advanced Custom Manufacturing, groupe finot, mouldCAM, Advanced Composites Manufacturing Centre, Base Group, BMComposites, Brodrene AA, Sea-Cubed Composites, NestorSales, Marine Plastics Ltd., Siemens, Cytec Industries etc.\nDownload the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3281907/\nAbout Reportbuyer\nReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers\nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com\nFor more information:\nSarah Smith\nResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.com\nEmail: query@reportbuyer.com\nTel: +44 208 816 85 48\nWebsite: www.reportbuyer.com\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-marine-composite-market---segmented-by-type-product-and-geography-2015---2020-300146749.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-marine-composite-market---segmented-by-type-product-and-geography-2015---2020-300146749.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=BR07723&Transmission_Id=201509212233PR_NEWS_USPR_____BR07723&DateId=20150921", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3281907/", "http://www.reportbuyer.com/"], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T07:46:20.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
