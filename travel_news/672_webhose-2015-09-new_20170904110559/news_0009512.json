Gordon, curator of Miami's McGuffey Museum and the university's unofficial historian.\nIt's far from frontier now – a small, but sophisticated community of higher learning, where classically styled homes line the streets and students and faculty mix at trendy shops and restaurants downtown (or, as the locals call it, uptown, because it's an uphill walk from campus).\nThe school was chartered in 1809 – in the state, only Ohio University is older -- after other southwest Ohio locations, including Cincinnati, Lebanon and Dayton, were ruled out.\nIf you go: Oxford, Ohio Getting there: Oxford is about 250 miles southwest of Cleveland, accessible via I-71 south to Ohio 63 and Ohio 73 west; or I-71 south to I-70 west to U.S. 127 south.\n Where to stay: We stayed at the Elms Hotel , formerly a Holiday Inn, perfectly located in downtown Oxford. Overnight-stay options have increased in recent decades and now include a Hampton Inn, Best Western and Comfort Inn. On the Miami campus is the Marcum Hotel & Conference Center. Also nearby: Hueston Woods State Park Lodge and several bed and breakfasts.\nDining and drinking: Mac & Joe's (21 E. High St.), Stella 12 Beech (12 S. Beech St.), Bagel & Deli (119 E. High St.), Patterson's Caf&eacute ; (103 W. Spring St.), O'Pub (10 W. Park Place)\nMcGuffey Museum : The museum is located on Miami's campus, at 410 E. Spring St. It's open 1-5 p.m. Thursday through Saturday.\nA second museum on campus, the Miami University Art Museum , was closed during our visit but reopened this week with several special exhibits, including \"Margaret Bourke-White's Photographs of U.S.S.R.\"\nFor information on dining, shopping and special events in Oxford: enjoyoxford.org\nFor information on the Miami campus : miamioh.edu\nOxford, named after the college town in England, was laid out a year later.\nIn recent years, Oxford has appeared atop several publications' lists of the best college towns in the nation, and it's hard to argue the point: the campus is lovely, the town charming.\nI spent two days here earlier this summer, and it made me wish I were 18 again.\nI started my tour at the McGuffey Museum, the former home of William Holmes McGuffey, whose McGuffey Readers revolutionized public education with their innovative storytelling and accessible style. Popular with both students and teachers, the series sold more than 120 million copies, placing it among the highest-selling volumes of all time.\nMcGuffey, a professor of ethics, Latin and Greek, didn't stay long in Oxford – he left in 1836 after 10 years, and moved on to other academic posts in Ohio and Virginia – but his years here were productive. He wrote the first four books in the series in this house, \"very possibly on this table,\" said Gordon, pointing to a felt-topped octagonal piece of furniture.\nIn addition to McGuffey's history, the museum tells the story of Oxford and Miami, named after the Native Americans who inhabited the region in the 18 th century. The university – which changed the name of its mascot from Redskins to Redhawks in 1997 – offers free tuition to qualifying members of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma.\nIn addition to Miami, Oxford was once home to three women's colleges – the Oxford Female Institute, Oxford Female College and Western College, all of which eventually merged with Miami.\nMiami University first admitted women in 1902, with the opening of its Ohio State Normal School, which helped the state meet a growing need for public school teachers.\n\"When word got out that a lot of young women were coming, then a lot of young men decided to come,\" said Gordon. \"Enrollment ballooned.\"\nToday, enrollment stands at about 18,000, the eighth largest public university in Ohio, best known for its strong business program, robust Greek life and stunning campus. (\"The most beautiful campus that ever was,\" said poet Robert Frost, a frequent Miami visitor.)\nThe U.S. Census lists Oxford's population at about 22,000 – but without students, the town is about a third that size.\nMy visit was in mid-July, when the campus and the town were relatively quiet. Not to worry – my two high school-age daughters and I had no trouble entertaining ourselves, exploring the shops and restaurants inside Oxford's Mile Square, the historic center of town.\nAmong the highlights:\n* Browsing for clothing, jewelry and gifts at Juniper (9 E. High St.), BlueTique (35 W. High St.), and the Apple Tree (28 E. High St.). We saved our biggest purchase, however, for DuBois Book Store , which offers a wide range of Miami attire.\n* Perusing an assortment of oddities at Wild Berry (15 W. High St.), which offers tie-dyed T-shirts, concert posters, gag gifts and a huge selection of incense. (After I got home, I learned that the store was founded in 1971 by a native of Cleveland Heights, which explains a lot.)\n* Feasting on tater tots and burgers at Mac & Joe's, the town's oldest tavern, tucked away in a back alley but worth seeking out; higher-end fare at sleek Stella 12 Beech; tasty morning fuel at Bagel and Deli; and sweet treats at Insomnia Cookies (a rapidly expanding chain of college-town bakeries my daughters discovered in Kent). Later in our stay, we also enjoyed lunch at Patterson's Café, a few blocks south of downtown.\nMy husband and I ended our evening at the O'Pub, a downtown bar hidden in plain sight, with no exterior sign or visible address, and yet seemingly well known by all. We asked a guy at the nearby Oxford Hookah Lounge where it was, and he stopped what he was doing and personally escorted us. This town was full of surprises.\nOur second day in Oxford, we sought a student's perspective. We signed up for a campus tour, led by Strongsville native Alyssa Koler, a senior majoring in American studies.\nShe took us into the Goggin Ice Center, where intramural broomball has an almost cult following, and through the gleaming Armstrong Student Center, new in 2014. We walked past the Farmer School of Business, seen in the 2011 George Clooney film \"Ides of March,\" and by Harrison Hall, named after President Benjamin Harrison, an 1852 graduate.\nWe walked around – not over -- the school seal, set into a walkway in the center of campus. It reads, in Latin, \"to accomplish rather than to seek fame.\"\nKoler explained that students who errantly step on the seal are doomed to fail their next exam. That is -- unless they rush over to another iconic Miami structure, an elevated sundial, and rub the bronze heads of the turtles at the base of the sculpture.\n\"Rubbing the turtle heads brings good luck,\" Koler revealed.\nA superstitious place, this.\nKoler also pointed out the Upham Arch, a lovely piece of campus architecture with a romantic twist: Kiss your significant other under the arch and you're destined to be together forever.\n\"I don't know if that's actually true,\" Koler admitted.\nTrue or not, I was smitten.\nComing tomorrow: The 10 best college towns in Ohio.", "external_links": ["http://www.enjoyoxford.org/", "http://miamioh.edu/cca/mcguffey-museum/", "http://www.miamioh.edu/cca/art-museum/", "http://shopbluetique.com/", "http://miamioh.edu/", "http://miamioh.edu/hdrbs/marcum/", "http://huestonwoodslodge.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/Juniperstyle", "http://www.macandjoes.com/", "http://www.theelmsoxford.com/", "http://www.wild-berry.com/16/home.htm", "http://www.pattersonscafe.com/", "http://www.duboisbookstore.com/miami/home.aspx", "http://www.bagelanddeli.com/", "http://www.stella12beech.com/", "http://www.appletreeoxford.boutique/"], "published": "2015-08-26T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T09:21:14.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
