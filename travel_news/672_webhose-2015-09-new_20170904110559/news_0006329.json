Lawmakers then convened Vice President Alejandro Maldonado to be sworn in as head of state later Thursday. \nMaldonado, a 79-year-old lawyer and former Constitutional Court judge, will hold power until an elected successor takes office on Jan. 14. \nThe session was broadcast live on national television, riveting the country in the midst of a whirlwind week that had already seen the courts issue a travel ban and arrest warrant for Pérez Molina \nRead all our coverage of the presidential scandal here \nThe embattled president stepped down after clinging to power through months of mounting protests. Guatemalans fed up with corruption erupted in celebration outside the Supreme Court early Thursday on the news of his resignation. \n“Otto, you thief, you’re going to Pavón!” they chanted, referring to one of the country’s main prisons. \nThousands have hit the streets in protest since the scandal first erupted in April, on a scale never before seen in Guatemala. \nThe accusations have stoked outrage in the Central American country of 15 million people, 53.7 percent of whom live in poverty, where the scars are still fresh from a 36-year civil war that ended in 1996. \nThe scandal was uncovered by investigators from a United Nations commission tasked with fighting high-level graft in Guatemala, who say they found massive evidence that Pérez Molina orchestrated a scheme dubbed “La Línea” (“The Line”), named for the hotline that importers would allegedly call to access a network of corrupt officials. \nInvestigators say their accusations are based on 89,000 wire-tapped phone calls. \nPérez Molina, a former military intelligence officer, long rejected calls to resign before his term ended. In office since 2012, he was ineligible for re-election and would have handed over to his successor in January. But his increasing isolation and the justice system’s relentless pursuit ultimately left him little choice. \nIn Costa Rica, the administration of President Luis Guillermo Solís issued a statement on Thursday saying officials in San José hoped constitutionality would prevail in “our sister Republic of Guatemala.” \n“It’s a decision entirely belonging to the Guatemalan laws and institutions, but it also is an event with regional implications,” President Solís said in a statement. “I think this is a moment in which Guatemala can demonstrate to the world its exemplary democratic behavior, and it should be a moment for all political and social forces to join the effort of strengthening democratic institutions; and it’s an opportunity for truth to shine, which after all is the light that should guide all the world’s people.” \nCosta Rican Foreign Minister Manuel González added that “Guatemala has the judicial mechanisms to solve this issue, and we hope that calm prevails; and we support the continuity of the electoral process in the conditions previously set, as [that process] should not be interrupted, but rather should continue providing guarantees of transparency and democracy.” \nGonzález added: “As a Central American country and member of SICA [the Central American Integration System], we will follow the situation, and we trust the authorities of Guatemala will adequately address these circumstances to the letter of the law. We will continue working with normality with the new president and his Cabinet on a broad and dynamic bilateral and regional agenda.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T01:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T03:06:21.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
