This resident base can, JLL reckons, optimally set aside up to Dh72,000 annually on rental or afford a home in the range of Dh790,000. (These are on estimates that a household should not spend no more than 30 per cent of its gross household income on housing.) \nBut only 22 percent of the units released (around 19,500 as per JLL’s reckoning) in the year to date can be described as being fit for a mid-income budgets. These include the Town Square by Nshama, Glitz 3 by Danube, MAG 5 by MAG and Remram (phase 2) by Dubai Properties Group. \nAs of now, “[the] only options for purchasing existing housing for less than Dh790,000 are in Arjan, Discovery Gardens, IMPZ, Liwan and Dubai International City, which are all at a distance from Dubai’s central business district,” the JLL report adds. \nThere was an announcement earlier this year from the Dubai Municipality that requires 15-20 percent of new projects to be targeted at middle-income earners. However, further clarifications are awaited. \nAccording to Craig Plumb, head of Research at JLL Mena, “We believe there is a need to re-think the existing relationship between government and the real estate development industry to create more affordable housing that middle-income families can afford. We also recommend more innovative planning and design initiatives to create more attractive, environmentally sustainable and cohesive communities as well as accessible financing, empowering middle income families to take a stake in their future. \n“Developments such as Nshama’s Town Square show that private sector developers are able to deliver affordable [products] for middle-income households in the UAE. Elsewhere in the region, timely government initiatives such as the launch of the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Housing‘s ‘Eskan’ project should result in progress towards the supply of 500,000 affordable units. In Egypt, both Arabtec and Orascom are also contributing significantly to the need to provide more affordable homes.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T21:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T20:39:55.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
