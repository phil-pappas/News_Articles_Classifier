Close to 5000 kilometres of diverse terrain in just over 2 weeks sounds awesome right? Add to the mix, a classic 1950s train car, enterprising company and surreal destinations and you have a magical concoction that I was privileged to live and experience on my trans USA coast to coast train journey. If you had tracked my journey through the trending hashtags #RoadTripUSA, #DiscoverAmerica #MTPTrain on social media, you would know what I am talking about. In case you do not know what I am talking about… I was invited by Brand USA and Discover America to be a part of a train journey called the Millennial Train Project . This project, a start-up incubator and guidance forum took selected individuals on a train journey across Southern USA . Each individual had a role to play. My role was to experience the diverse destinations of the United States of America. And thus I traveled with this MTP Team in classic 1950 era train cars that was fitted with open domes, dining cars, kitchens, bedrooms, wi-fi and so much more. Traveling in that train made me feel like royalty. It was on this train ride that I got to experience a bedroom with an attached bathroom. I have traveled countless number of times on trains, but this luxury experience was my first. The journey took me across 8 lovely destinations. My experience in each destination was so good that I always ached to spend a longer time at each place. Be it the Hollywood experience of Los Angeles (California), the Route 66 culture and history of Santa Monica (California), the riverside charm of San Antonio (Texas), the bustling energy of Austin (Texas), the French connection in New Orleans (Louisiana) and definitely my favorite city in the USA , the port city of Baltimore (Maryland), the capital city of Washington DC or finally the bustling metropolis we all know as the Big Apple – New York City (New York), I felt like I was living a dream. Each day, was a high for me. In this one minute Travel Video, live my surreal coast to coast rail journey If there was one thing that captivated me the most on this trip, it had to be the sheer size and diversity of this nation. The landscapes, especially were sensational. From the beaches of California, the arid desert of Arizona, the riverside atmosphere of San Antonio and Austin, the swamps around the mighty Mississippi at New Orleans, the organized capital of Washington DC, the quite port side action at Baltimore to the eclectic, high energy glitter and bustle of New York City, this journey offered me delights all along the way.
