Like the majority of the Costa Rican properties signing up directly with Oveedia, Playa Escondida will be exclusive to the Oveedia database and not available on any other OTA. Even those properties currently listing with Airbnb have committed to leaving the platform, expecting to list exclusively with Oveedia.\n“Our growth is directly in-line with our initial projections and we’re just getting started,” stated Melvin Pereira, President and CEO of Pure Hospitality Solutions, Inc. “Even now, ‘pre-launch,’ we have been getting quite a response from properties throughout Costa Rica, looking to become part of the Oveedia family. We expect this interest to continue and the number of exclusive listings to increase.”\nThe Playa Escondida Lodge is known as a property where ‘the jungle meets the ocean.’ The smaller, but spacious lodge, rests on 2 acres of beachfront property. The owners of Playa Escondida endorsed Oveedia stating, “I immediately saw the high potential of Oveedia as soon as I encountered it in the news. I have been listing with Airbnb since the beginning, and I foresee a similar, or even better success for Oveedia, in Costa Rica and Central America. This [Oveedia] is a real booster for the Central American tourism industry and I personally want to be part of the Company; not only as a client, but also as a shareholder!”\nMr. Pereira concluded, “We are truly humbled to receive an endorsement offering such positive words of encouragement. It certainly means a lot. Especially from people who know just how necessary it is to have an OTA that caters to the Central American-Caribbean hospitality markets.”\nSource:- Pure Hospitality", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T19:04:21.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
