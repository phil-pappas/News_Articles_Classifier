The number of students who enrolled onto the one-year MBA programme increased by more than 50% from last year. In addition, the number of students undertaking the flagship three-year Bachelor of Business Administration with honours in International Hospitality Management programme has increased significantly. \n\n\nRon Hilvert, Managing Director of EAHM, said: “The increase in student numbers is testament to the growth of the hospitality and tourism sector in Dubai and the UAE. These students have a wonderful career ahead of them as the city prepares for EXPO 2020 and we are privileged that they have chosen us as their preferred education provider.” \n\n\nDr John Fong, Director of Business Development and Consulting and an Associate Professor at EAHM, oversees the student recruitment. He said: “Our international students are always impressed with the Dubai brand. What we have achieved in such a short space of time is astonishing and hence why students from around the world wish to learn from us.” \n\n\nSince 2001, EAHM has been one of the leading providers of University-level hospitality business education. Both undergraduate and postgraduate degrees are offered to help develop the hospitality leaders of the future. Owned by the Jumeirah Group and located directly opposite the Burj Al Arab Jumeirah, students at EAHM receive excellent internship and employment opportunities upon graduation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T17:44:37.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
