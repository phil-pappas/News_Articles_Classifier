Sruthi Kumar, Marine Biologist There are many places across the globe where I have dived. However, I travelled to Lakshadweep by myself as a part of my research project and I must say, that is one of the best places for a diver to be. It is much better than Andaman, Philippines or Sri Lanka. The water is like a two-way mirror through which one can glimpse at the life underwater. The coral reef here is also one of the most beautifully developed ones, that I have seen. Travelling from one island to another in Lakshadweep for about two years was one of my most amazing experiences. I cherish it completely. Waseem F Ahmed, Photographer: Initially I used to be the kind of traveller who took the DSLR along and took pictures of all the places I travelled to. In late 2012, when I was at Fatehpur Sikri, everything changed. For the first time, the beauty of a place made me put down my camera. I realised that what you see through your eyes is not comparable to what you try to capture through the lens. People came and started talking to me, made great conversations and I truly started to enjoy being there. Ever since, I never take my camera along with me when I travel, just a GoPro at the max. The kind of stories you become entwined with when you travel alone is the most beautiful part about it. Dhanish Krishna, Sound Engineer I was born and brought up in Dubai and India was a completely new place. My first solo trip here happened when I was in college in Coimbatore. It was the vacations and all my friends had gone home. I, on the other hand, went to the nearby railway station and booked a ticket for myself in the next train, which was going to Hyderabad. I visited the Makkah Masjid for the first time and when I sat there and looked around, I felt peaceful. I could see people around me relaxing and enjoying that peace just like me. There was no pain, sorrow or uncertainty and at that moment all I could hear was the pigeons cooing. The best part was that, since I was by myself, there was no distraction around and I could enjoy the silence. Anuradhini V, Corporate Honcho There are many places that I want to travel to, however, my friendsâ€™ work schedule and mine never matched for us to take such trips often. It was then that I came across WOW (Women On Wanderlust) club. I booked myself on their Leh-Ladakh trip. I travelled with strangers and it was a life changing and liberating experience, especially I was surrounded by strangers for my 50th birthday, but it was the best. Today, I have become friends with the women I travelled with and I cherish those moments where I was myself.\n lifestyle travel Marine World Also Read In wake of US ruling, Taiwanese rally for gay marriage 5 people killed in shooting in Switzerland: police Watch: This dog doesn't bark, she talks!
