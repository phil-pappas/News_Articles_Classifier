The airline first became the most popular carrier ever on Facebook when it passed eight million fans in December 2014, and has held the title consistently since.\nQatar Airways Group Chief Executive, His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker said: “Qatar Airways’ success is directly related to our connection with our customers, whether on-board or on-line. Awards such as the 2015 Skytrax World’s Best Airline and recognition such as this recent milestone achieved with 10 million fans on Facebook serve to motivate us to continue anticipating our customers’ needs and delivering a great experience.\nWithout our loyal passengers and our social media fans, none of this would be possible.”\nQatar Airways created its Facebook account in 2011, and has grown its on-line community through multiple engagement strategies, including current competitions such as “The Heart of Barca”, where FC Barcelona fans can enter to win exclusive prizes and experiences. Other successes include the recent “#DREAMSterdam” competition, asking fans to submit original art work capturing the spirit of Amsterdam, which Qatar Airways started serving in June 2015.\nMore than 280 original art work pieces were submitted for this competition, and a gallery is available on Qatar Airways’ Facebook page to view them. Qatar Airways Senior Vice President Marketing and Corporate Communications Ms. Salam Al Shawa, said: “We are so proud of this achievement, because our fans provide instant feedback and validation, and together we are a community that learns from each other and celebrates milestones together. Our fans represent all of the regions of the world we serve, more than 150 destinations on six continents, and they all share the same love of travel and the wonder of flying.”\nSource:- Qatar Airways", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T15:11:35.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
