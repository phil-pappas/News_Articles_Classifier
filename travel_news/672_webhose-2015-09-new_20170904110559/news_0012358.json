However, the overall global rise is up just 1% in the first half of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 according to the latest Hotel Price Index™. \nMore travelers, higher consumer spending in key areas and strong currency fluctuations have all contributed to this result. However, there was great news for British travelers as, with the strength of the Pound, they paid less in over half of the 121 destinations in the report. \nThe HPI is a regular report on hotel prices in major destinations across the world, tracking the movement in prices that people actually paid* for their accommodation and providing valuable insight into the reasons behind these changes. The data is drawn from bookings made on the hundreds of thousands of hotels on the Hotels.com websites worldwide. \nWhat this meant to British travelers \nEuropean prices took a tumble as travelers from the UK paid less on average in 80% of the European destinations in the report across the continent. The country with the biggest decrease in average price was in the Ukraine, with Kiev dropping 48% to £65 per night. This was followed by Moscow in Russia dropping 36% to £92 per night. Even after a decrease of 2% to £218 per night, Monte Carlo still registered the highest paid for room rates for travllers in the first six months of the year. \nIt was a different story across the pond in the USA, as the US Dollar was one of the few currencies which was stronger against the Pound over the first six months of 2015 compared to 2014. Fifteen of the 16 destinations in the HPI saw growth in average, with Key West the top location for highest average price paid with a 2% increase to £196 per night. Fort Lauderdale saw the highest percentage increase with a 31% surge to £132 per night. \nOnce again, Asia was the best value for money for British travelers with eight of the 10 cities included in the HPI featured at the bottom of the table. The largest decrease was seen in Phuket, down 29% to £58 per night. The falling value of the Yen contributed to attracting an increase in travelers globally[2], with prices paid from UK visitors ranging from £106 per night in Tokyo and £89 per night in Kyoto. \nIn terms of weaker currencies, the Australian Dollar allowed for prices to decrease in some of the key cities, including Perth (down 19% to £98 per night) and Sydney (down 5% to £116 per night). The falling Real following the 2014 World Cup saw the average prices paid in Latin America to also drop. Brazil in particular saw hotel average prices paid drop 27% to £122 per night in Rio de Janeiro during the first six months of the year. \nAverage hotel prices per room per night paid by UK travelers in the first six months of 2015 compared with the same period in 2014 (sorted by H1 2015 price) \nDestination H1 2015 H1 2014 % change Monte Carlo GBP218 GBP223 -2% Key West GBP196 GBP192 2% Boston GBP182 GBP153 19% New York GBP171 GBP171 0% Muscat GBP170 GBP197 -14% San Francisco GBP165 GBP153 8% Riviera Maya GBP165 GBP169 -2% Seattle GBP161 GBP133 21%", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T08:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T08:53:01.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
