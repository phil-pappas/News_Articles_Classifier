They were both found in the same room.\n“The cuts were not due to resistance or a struggle. The wounds were literally aimed at causing pain,” Micheel said.\nPhotojournalists protest with T-shirts that say “Justice For Rubén” in Mexico City, on Aug. 16, 2015.\nYuri Cortéz/AFP\nJustice\nThe other victims included Mile Virginia Martín, a 29-year-old Colombian, and Yesenia Quiróz, an 18-year-old Mexican. They were both models. A domestic employee, 40-year-old Alejandra Negrete, also was killed.\nMartín was sexually assaulted while Quiróz was strangled. They were also shot and found in another room. Negrete was shot and her body was left in the bathroom.\nThe investigative reports suggest the assailants may have used the bathroom or something else to clean up the blood, Micheel said. The killers did not leave any murder weapon behind.\nMexico City authorities detained on Sunday a former police officer in connection with the killing.\nAbraham Torres Tranquilino, 24, worked as an officer in the capital until 2011, when he was sentenced to almost five years in prison for torture in another crime. But he only spent one year behind bars.\nAnother suspect, Daniel Pacheco Gutiérrez, was detained on Aug. 4. He is also a former convict who served time for rape.\nHundreds of writers, filmmakers and journalists published a second open letter to President Enrique Peña Nieto over the case on Monday, urging him to solve the crime and better protect journalists.\nBritish novelist Salman Rushdie and Oscar-winning Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón were among the signatories of the missive published in El Universal newspaper with the front-page headline “They Won’t Silence Us.”\nMore than 80 journalists have been killed since 2000, while 17 more have disappeared, according to Reporters Without Borders.\nAt least 12 reporters have been killed in Veracruz since Governor Javier Duarte took office in 2010.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T09:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:56:02.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
