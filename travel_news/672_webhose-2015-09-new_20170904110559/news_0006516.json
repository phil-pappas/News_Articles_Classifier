But how many towns offer multiple exhibits for folks who want to gawk at money? There’s no place like New York.\nThose with more refined sensibilities may not understand, but some of us just love money, period. My favorite possession may be my giant bowl of coins. It’s far more beautiful and interesting than anything it could buy.\nHappily, for the cash obsessed, there are several local spots where one can see a lot more dough than what’s in one’s wallet, starting with the Museum of American Finance, a 26-year-old institution largely funded by Wall Street firms and wealthy donors.\nA trip to the museum, housed in a lovely old bank building on Wall Street, starts with a big currency exhibit—three walls plastered with cash! Dedicated to American moolah, the display even includes a beaver pelt and a 2007 ViVOpay 4500 credit card reader.\nTurns out, until 1929, when everything went to hell, U.S. bills were colorful and whimsical, featuring images like a naked devil in a top hat and what looks like a cowboy posing with the Virgin Mary and a small, friendly dog.\n© Claudio Papapietro for The Wall Street Journal Spokeswoman Kristin Aguilera said the most popular display at the museum, which is designed to educate the public about finance, is the $2 million solid-gold Monopoly set.\nA history-of-the-markets exhibit includes old stock certificates, ticker tape machines and groovy technology like a 1981 Quotron terminal. A display dedicated to commodities futures, meanwhile, cunningly represents the livestock industry with a plastic pork belly. Oh, money—thy incarnations are wondrous and infinite.\nFor coin buffs, there’s the American Numismatic Society on Varick Street, also in lower Manhattan. The Society maintains an internationally known collection of more than 800,000 coins and medals, and a library of 100,000-plus holdings, including the Whitman Encyclopedia of Mexican Money Volume II, copies of Money Trend dating to 1971 and the promotional brochure “Disneyland Minnie Money is here.”\nThe Society’s current exhibit includes a display of iron African tribal currency in the shape of, among other items, a life-size spear and a hoe. Imagine stabbing enemies and planting turnips with your money.\nThe climax of my money tour was to be a visit to the gold vaults at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. I almost didn’t get in. The free tours are booked solid through the end of October. Spokesman Eric Pajonk said many slots are taken by school groups whose teachers want them to learn about monetary policy.\n“Kids must love that,” I said.\n“Maybe I would have,” said Mr. Pajonk, “Which is probably the reason I wound up working here.”\nThe tour started with a backgrounder on the bank’s massive 1924 building on Liberty Street, modeled on an Italian palazzo, and an introduction to the central banking system. It was interesting, but I found myself thinking, “Just show me the money!”\nFinally we took an elevator down four stories and filed through the bank’s 90-ton steel cylinder revolving door to the vaults.\nThe world’s largest known stash of gold, according to the bank—7,000 tons, valued at about $250 billion—is housed in a fluorescent-lit basement in a series of 122 barred cages painted turquoise, each representing the account of a different country or central bank. It looked like a jail for money.\nI asked our guide if anyone had ever gone crazy seeing the gold. “No one cries, no one jumps up and down, no one passes out,” she said.\nI could see why. You can’t really see much of the gold from the viewing pen, much less roll around in it.\nWhat we were allowed to handle was one of the magnesium shoe covers worn by the workers who transport the gold bars, each weighing 27 pounds.\nWhen the guide asked for questions, a Japanese tourist raised his hand to wonder, “When do we get some samples?”\nLast stop: Bitcoin Center NYC, dedicated to educating the public about the notorious virtual currency.\nAlas, the Broad Street location was abandoned. Behind the locked storefront lay what looked like the remains of a party—pizza boxes, paper cups, napkins.\nI questioned the building’s security guard. “Bitcoin Center?” he replied, lighting a cigarette. “Never heard of it. What’s a Bitcoin?”\nNick Spanos, the Center’s founder and backer, said the Financial District location didn’t pan out: “It’s all tourists and people who already know everything.”\nA relocated Bitcoin Center, with a cafe and an open workspace, should open soon on Cleveland Place in NoLiTa.\nIt would have opened already, said Mr. Spanos, but he had spent some time in the hospital: “I ate 100 oysters.”\nI can wait. Bitcoin, after all, aims to render all the wonderful sights I just witnessed entirely obsolete. A big bowl of virtual currency just wouldn’t be the same.\nWrite to Anne Kadet at Anne.Kadet@wsj.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://online.wsj.com/"], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T10:44:22.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
