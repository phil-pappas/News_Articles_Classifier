Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Sep 03, 2015 eTN   \nEquatorial Congo Airlines (EC Air), host of the 2015 AFRAA Annual General Assembly in November, has taken delivery of another B737 on wet lease from Belgium’s JetairFly, joining two B737 sisterships already on the airline’s fleet. The additional aircraft will, according to information received, operate on domestic routes to Pointe Noire and Oyo while also serving Libreville, Douala, and Cotonou in its West African network. \nThe move, using a European-registered aircraft, OO-JJI, permits EC Air to operate flights without falling prey to the EU’s blacklist ban, as their leased aircraft are under EU safety oversight, allowing for flights to Europe and other destinations where such details matter. \nThe AFRAA’s 47th AGA will take place in Brazzaville from November 8-10 at the Kintele International Sports Complex, some 14 kilometers from the airport, under the theme: “Open Skies: Growth through Competition and Collaboration.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T06:37:39.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
