The car park was tiny and I was always terrified of scraping one of the Ford Focuses before I’d even gotten on to the road. I was cutting my teeth as a reporter on a local newspaper and I’d recently been given the role of court reporter. I loved spending mornings at Colchester Magistrates’ Court listening to the misdeeds of residents and afternoons writing them up for the next day’s paper. On this particular day I got to cover one of the bigger cases sent to one of the crown courts for trial. I was on my way to Ipswich Crown Court for a sentencing. Starting the engine, I spotted the fuel gauge – there was less than a quarter of a tank. It was probably enough to get me to Ipswich, but I’m one of those people who gets nervous as soon as the arrow falls below half. So I was having palpitations already. There was a supermarket with a filling station minutes away so I decided to make a stop. I’d never filled a pool car before, so I wasn’t sure which side the fuel cap was on. I fist-pumped when I pulled into the pump on the correct side. That’s when I spotted the big black sticker on the keyring ... I knew then what I’d done I quickly filled the tank, made sure I got a receipt so I could claim the money back on expenses and hopped back in the car. Like my mother, I’d rather be an hour early than a minute late for anything, so I had lots of time left to get to court. But driving down the road, the car started juddering. Panicked, I slowed, then revved the engine gently. After more bunny-hopping I whacked on the hazard lights and pulled on to a grass verge – just as smoke started pouring out the bonnet. I leapt out and pulled out my mobile. That’s when I spotted the big black sticker on the keyring attached to the car key. I knew then what I’d done. I was used to filling up my VW Golf with petrol. I’d never filled up a pool car and I’d gone on to autopilot: I’d put petrol in a diesel car! I sheepishly called and explained what had happened to my news editor and was met with silence. That was a first. I’d never known a news editor lost for words. As the breakdown truck loaded the car, the mechanic assured me these things happen all the time but I could tell that he thought I was an idiot. I’ve no idea how much flushing the engine cost – thankfully the editor was understanding and didn’t make a big deal of it. But I missed the sentencing and I only ever drove a pool car with a full tank after that! Filling up with the wrong fuel really is a common mistake. And if you do slip up, the AA will happily come to your rescue.
