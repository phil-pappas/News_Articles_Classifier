The PSA uses the “No Drone Zone” slogan to drive home the point that flying an unmanned aircraft near a manned aircraft is illegal and dangerous. It refers viewers to the FAA’s unmanned aircraft website and to the knowbeforeyoufly.org website for further information and guidance on flying unmanned aircraft safely and responsibly. \nThe PSA will air all day today following its unveiling at an unmanned aircraft safety press event that the airport organized and hosted. After that, it will air for two weeks surrounding the winter holidays - a time when many people will be getting drones as gifts. Denver also will post the PSA on the airport website so it will reach travelers every day of the year. The FAA has partnered with leading unmanned aircraft industry and hobbyist groups in the Know Before You Fly education campaign, and the campaign materials are now featured in product packaging for several types of UAS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T21:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T21:50:49.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
