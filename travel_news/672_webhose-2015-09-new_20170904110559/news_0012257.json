A surprisingly diverse new breed of bucolic retreats — from upscale woodcutter’s cabins to remodeled pig shelters — are reinventing down-on-the-farm hospitality. Soho Farmhouse The members-only Soho House has just opened its latest outpost: a renovated 18th-century farmhouse and cottage complete with 40 wood cabins and its own pub, all open to nonmembers. In the Oxfordshire village of Great Tew, around 90 minutes to the northwest of London, each of the handsome timber abodes comes equipped with a range cooker, free-standing bath (some outdoors) and, if you’re lucky, veranda views of the boating lake. True to its outdoorsy ethos, in lieu of cars there are eau-de-nil bikes and tuk-tuks, or a horse-drawn cart. So idyllic is the Cotswolds site, with its rustic interior and organic farm fare (served to your room or in the open-all-hours main barn), that #sohofarmhouse has already inspired more than 1,500 envy-inducing Instagram posts. Photo A wood-paneled bathroom at Soho Farmhouse. Firefly In the blink-and-you-miss-it Cornish hamlet of Trebudannon, what was a simple stable is now a charming woodcutter’s cabin . Its owner Sarah Stanley, the director of Unique Home Stays, which sells and rents luxurious homes-away-from-home across Britain , has created a distinctive and earthy retreat on the grounds of her family’s farm. Huge, reclaimed barn doors open to reveal a wildflower garden and soon-to-be-completed natural swimming pond. Stanley’s from-the-land aesthetic is borrowed from cattle sheds encountered on her travels through the Australian Outback and permeates throughout, from the sun-deck stove to the corrugated tin bathroom. Calfshed It took seven years for Ben and Sarah Lambert to turn the 500-year-old Upcott Farm into a comfy family home with sleek, rentable outhouses. Most notable is the Devonshire barn decked out with soft, whitewashed décor. The Georgian property’s walled kitchen garden is rich with fresh, edible treats — and chickens (and the occasional wild rabbit) typically roam the well-tended grounds. The wilder climes of the Exmoor National Park are also close at hand. Photo The main entrance of Home Farm Cottage.

The three-bedroom bolt-hole, with open fires and the option of a cook and housekeeper, is just yards from the luxurious 17th-century hotel and has access to its spa, private cinema and upmarket drinking hole, the Village Pub. Farmyard eggs and milk are in ready supply, as is fresh produce from the hotel’s fabled gardens designed by the late Rosemary Verey. The Chickenshed In the thrilling landscape of the Wye Valley, on the English-Welsh border, a former poultry shed has been ingeniously upgraded into a modern-style, glass- and timber-clad sanctuary. Sheepskin throws and a wood-burning stove lend a Nordic feel, finished off with furnishings from the design workshop of celebrated locals Barnby & Day. Mafanwy’s Ark Those on the hunt for a hands-on rural experience can stay in this traditional pig ark — a vaulted swine shelter — on a family-friendly, working Welsh farm. It’s totally no-frills; and despite its miniscule-seeming proportions, it sleeps six. Breakfast, cooked on your own pit fire, is a highlight, as is the chance to shadow Farmer Rob on his rounds as he tends his rare stock of Highland cattle and black pigs. There’s a one-day pig-rearing course for those with an appetite for more.
