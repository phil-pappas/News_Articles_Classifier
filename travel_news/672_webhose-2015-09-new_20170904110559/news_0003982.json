It’s not surprising: today’s sixth-form students know that studying a STEM discipline at university provides them with a route into a huge number of dynamic, cutting-edge careers. And awareness of how vital work in these areas is has never been higher. “In a world in which the UK’s competitive advantage will depend increasingly on innovation and high-value products and services, it is essential that we raise the level of our STEM skills,” Lord Sainsbury, chancellor of the University of Cambridge, has said. Wendy Piatt, the director general of the Russell Group, agrees – she believes that recruiting the very brightest minds to STEM subjects is “vital to the future prospects of young people, and the success of UK business”. There’s no doubt that the Awards make a tangible difference to the lives of future leaders in design, energy, healthcare, innovation and aerospace This is why the Telegraph Media Group (TMG) and all those sponsoring the 2016 UK STEM Awards are so delighted to be involved in the competition. Speaking personally, is a real privilege for me to be on the judging panel this year. As the Daily Telegraph’s Education Editor, I sometimes come across people in business who are worried about undergraduates leaving university unprepared for the world of work. I’m happy to say that the quality of entries to the Telegraph UK STEM Awards prove conclusively that this isn’t the case. The students whose application forms we’ve received in the past two years have been brimming over with ideas that could change the world, and they’ve had the technical and business acumen to back them up. We want to give these young people every possible assistance – and there’s no doubt that the Awards can, and do, make a real and tangible difference to the lives of future leaders in design , energy , healthcare , innovation and aerospace . The world-leading employers supporting the competition – Babcock International Group, Atkins, GSK, McLaren, Semta and Rolls-Royce – will offer the young people who get through to the finals, and the winner themselves, access to priceless industry experience, giving them a springboard into the career of their dreams. Read the interview with two of last year’s category winners who explain how entering has changed their lives, and career trajectories, for ever . I hope their stories will inspire current undergraduates reading this to throw their hat into the ring. Remember, all that’s standing between you and the chance to achieve the same level of success is an application form. Good luck! STEM Awards 2016 Change your future.
