Hamilton lost theirs. Hawkes Bay had a crack at it and decided it wasn't viable,\" he said. \nQueenstown is the main exception, with direct trans-tasman flights. \n\"It's not in our strategy to do that,\" he said. \"We are a regional airport. \n\"The writing is on the wall. The airlines aren't interested.\" \nHe said it did not make financial sense to run a small number of international flights from the regions. \n\"There is no incentive for airlines to fly two or three or four flights a week,\" he said. \n\"International services to Sydney once or twice a week don't accommodate everyone's needs.\" \nLanham said business people in particular needed frequent flights. \n\"Ultimately a lot of those services are not profitable and so if you want those services then the city or the region needs to underwrite them,\" he said. \n\"We have an international airport in Wellington just two hours down the road.\" \nLanham said in comparison with other countries, New Zealand had good air linkages. \n\"We are well served in terms of domestic and international.\" \nLanham said the airport's current focus was on growing frequency to Auckland and Christchurch, giving people choice of international destinations. \nOn Monday, Jetstar announced its Auckland to Palmerston North flight service but the next cab off the rank could be a Christchurch route. \n\"We make no secret of the fact that we would like to see Palmerston North to Christchurch,\" Lanham said. \n\"It makes sense to have that South Island linkage. \n\"Ideally Jetstar would have onward connections from there to the likes of Dunedin, Queenstown and Invercargill so we think it's an important part of phase two,\" Lanham said. \nJetstar New Zealand head Grant Kerr said an international route from the airport was not a current option. \n\"International flights are not on our radar at this point in time, but we never say never,\" he said. \n\"Our main purpose is to bring low fares and give people choice. \n\"Flying to Auckland there are a number of different directions that travellers can go. Flying directly from here there is just one destination across the Tasman,\" Kerr said. \nKerr said that Auckland already had the infrastructure in place to support international travel. \nHe said Jetstar could expand it's domestic Palmerston North operation once the new route was properly established. \n\"This is our first phase and we will be looking for other opportunities once we bed in this operation. \n\"We've got Christchurch. That would and could be an option,\" he said \nKerr said the new route from Palmerston North is expected to create new ground handling and check-in staff jobs and a boost for motels with aircraft crew overnighting in the city. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T08:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T17:11:03.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
