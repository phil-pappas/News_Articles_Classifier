It is also about ensuring that you aren’t throwing money away on a day-to-day basis. Have a look at three simple ways you can save at least £100 a year. Avoid paying more than you must for your energy . Many energy companies offer discounts of around £100 a year to customers who agree to pay by direct debit. Suppliers will often also agree discounts for paperless billing. And if you handle account matters online, this type of billing has wider energy-saving implications, cutting the paper needed to send out and pay bills by post. According to gas and electricity regulator Ofgem, customers who switch both gas and electricity suppliers could also stand to save up to £100 a year. Do your research – there are several comparison sites online where you can find the suppliers offering the best prices and service. Save money in the supermarket . These days, discount and own-brand supermarket products are of great quality – and much cheaper than branded goods. Take your daily brew – a packet of 160 PG Tips pyramid tea bags typically costs £4.25, but if you swap for the same size pack of Morrisons’ own label you’ll pay £1.99. How about a packet of fruit shortcake biscuits to go with it? Buy McVitie’s and you’ll pay around 64p for a 200g packet, while Lidl will sell you something similar for 49p.Of course, you’ll need to wash up afterwards. The budget store will sell you its award-winning 500ml bottle of washing-up liquid for 59p, as opposed to around £1.50 for a slightly larger bottle of Fairy. Say you buy those three items a couple of times a month and switch from brands to budget for those alone – over the course of a year you’ll save just over £100. Pay your children to do jobs around the house and then make sure they don’t pay tax on the savings accounts they put it in . Parents can save money into children’s accounts and earn up to £100 a year tax-free, but you need to be proactive, because HM Revenue & Customs automatically taxes every savings account at 20pc, regardless of whether tax is due. You need to fill in Form R85, which stops 20pc tax being deducted at source, so the saver receives all the advertised interest. Meanwhile, getting them to help with the cleaning, ironing and dog walking saves you money on professional help over the course of the year, while teaching them the value of money. Shop smart: avoiding branded goods can save you a packet Photo: Getty OTHER SMART WAYS TO SAVE Don't buy bottled water: Fill up a reusable bottle with tap water instead. Lobby group Tapwater.org claims that the average British consumer gulps their way through £25,000 of bottled water in a lifetime. Dry January: British households typically spend £15.20 a week on alcohol. One analysis suggested a “dry January” each year could eventually add £20,000 to your pension, if invested.
