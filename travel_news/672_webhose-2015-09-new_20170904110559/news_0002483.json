Tired of having nothing to do? How about a scavenger hunt?\nJay Carlson of Atlanta has created a line of ready-to-do scavenger hunt books for his new company, ClueTown Books . The books are filled with puzzles, riddles and word games that lead to different destinations around metro Atlanta. At each location, landmarks help hunters solve for clues. In the process, players get a tour and learn a lot about some of metro Atlanta's best-known neighborhoods.\n\"These aren't just books; they're activities of mystery,\" says Carlson, a web designer, publisher and 'zine enthusiast who lives in Kirkwood. \"I spend months surveying each location and designing the clues to create the most interesting scavenger hunt a reader can experience. Then the books are published, and I assemble each by hand.\"\nClueTown creator Jay Carlson Individual books are priced at $15 each, or $60 for a set of four that includes the Beltline, downtown Decatur, Piedmont Park and Oakland Cemetery.\nTo shop for unique handcrafted gifts and items, many by Atlanta artisans, visit Shoppe by Scoutmob .\nClueTown books are made by an artisan from Atlanta's Kirkwood neighborhood.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/09/10/ba/2b/cluetownJayCarlson.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/09/10/30/a6/cluetownkit.jpg", "http://scoutmob.com/a/clue-town-books?source=ajc&medium=article&campaign=2015-09-cluetown", "http://scoutmob.com/atlanta/scoutfinds/5198?source=ajc&medium=article&campaign=2015-09-cluetown"], "published": "2015-09-09T14:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T01:56:23.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
