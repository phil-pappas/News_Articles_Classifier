The exclusive fine-art collection is now on permanent display in the hotel’s Gallery, offering the perfect backdrop for small events in the charming space.\n“We are honored to display this pristine collection at our hotel,” says Adriaan Radder, Mandarin Oriental, Washington DC General Manager. “The collection reflects our hotel’s sense of place in the beautiful and historical city of Washington, D.C. and we couldn’t be more delighted to provide this unique exhibition to our guests.”\nEquipped with a private elevator, a wall of windows, and a large flagstone patio overlooking the Jefferson Memorial and the city’s famed Cherry Blossom trees, the Gallery is the ideal location to host an intimate event or meeting. The room features an abundance of natural light, an exclusive outdoor terrace, unparalleled views and privacy for the many events which take place there including weddings, corporate meetings, business conferences and special events.\nTIMELESS Collection captures the undeniable beauty of the ephemeral Cherry Blossoms in full-bloom.
