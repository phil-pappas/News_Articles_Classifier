Picture: REUTERS/STEPHEN LAM Related articles From glitz to balance sheet glitch for car makers Tesla faces bogeymen in electric dream Suzuki and VW finally clear their throats FREMONT — Tesla Motors delivered the first of its long-awaited Model X electric sports-utility vehicles (SUVs) on Tuesday, a product investors are counting on to make the pioneering company profitable after years of losses.\nThe launch of the Model X represents a milestone for the loss-making Silicon Valley car maker during a period of high spending and modest growth, because it can now boast a second model in production beyond its Model S sedan, launched in 2012.\n\"I think we got a little carried away with the X,\" CEO Elon Musk told reporters ahead of a launch event near the company’s Fremont factory, where luxury Model Xs have been moving down the production line in recent weeks, nearly two years behind the company’s original schedule.\nMr Musk estimated that 25,000 customers had pre-ordered the crossover online or in its stores and that it would take eight to 12 months for those ordering from now to receive the SUV.\nIn retrospect, the company could have done less, Mr Musk said.\n\"There is far more there than is really necessary to sell a car. And some of the things are so difficult, they make the car better but the difficulty of engineering those parts is so high.\"\nBetween 4,000 and 6,000 guests filled a cavernous space for the launch. Invited to the event were Model X reservation holders, Tesla employees and Model S and Roadster owners. The Roadster sportscar, which is no longer in production, was the company’s first vehicle.\nMr Musk has said the all-wheel drive Model X — with two electric motors, the ability to travel about 400km on a single charge and seating for seven people — was \"the hardest car to build in the world\".\nPriced as high as $144,000, it features so-called \"falcon-wing\" doors that open upward rather than to the side — controlled by sensors that can modulate the height to clear garage ceilings — seats that can be adjusted separately and a panoramic windshield that extends overhead.\nMr Musk said the biggest challenges were making the doors open in a graceful \"balletic\" manner; the expansive windshield, which he said was the largest piece of glass ever used in a car; its sun visor; and the moveable seats, which he said were deceptively tricky.\n\"One of the hardest things to design is a good seat,\" he said.\nAlthough global adoption of electric vehicles has been slow, Tesla has been the US pioneer in luxury electric cars charged by batteries. It is betting that high-performance and stylish offerings will boost acceptance amid a sea of alternatives, such as hybrids or electric vehicles powered by hydrogen.\nTesla predicted its SUV would receive five-star safety ratings in all categories, based on data from its crash tests, due to its low centre of gravity, which helps reduce rollovers.\nThe Model X, like the Model S, would be continuously improved, Tesla said, due to software transmitted \"over the air\". A highly anticipated update expected within the next month will allow for an autopilot function, in which cars can be driven hands-free on freeways.\nAhead of pack\nThe buzz surrounding Tesla’s Model S sedan — whose P85D variant won a top score of 100 from Consumer Reports magazine in August — has managed to pre-empt high-end German rivals such as Volkswagen’s Audi and Porsche, BMW and Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz.\nAt the Frankfurt Auto Show earlier in September, Audi unveiled its e-tron quattro SUV, and Porsche showed off its first battery-powered sports car, although neither will be available before 2018.\nBut spending on the Model X, a new Nevada battery factory and the lower-cost Model 3 due by late 2017, have all increased capital expenses, which totalled $831.2m in the first half of the year.\nThe Model X, Mr Musk said, \"gives us a cash flow stream we can use to develop and facilitate\" Tesla’s three vehicles either in production or development.\nSix new cars were delivered on Tuesday to a group made up of Tesla board members, investors and friends of Mr Musk who had pre-ordered.\nIn August, Mr Musk said Tesla would make between 50,000 and 55,000 Model S and Model X vehicles this year, with the capacity for 1,600-1,800 vehicles a week on its production line next year.\nTuesday’s unveiling showcased the top-of-the-line \"Signature\" Model X, priced between $132,000 and $144,000, with optional add-ons such as acceleration upgrades, packages for subzero weather package or towing.\nThe company has not disclosed pricing for the base model, but Mr Musk said that in the future there would be a \"lower-cost\" Model X.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T17:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:48:02.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
