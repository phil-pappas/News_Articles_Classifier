He was very disappointed, obviously, but they’re not out of it yet. Post-match, he doesn’t want to dwell on it and I don’t want to make him. He’s obviously missing his kids and he likes to hear what we’ve been up to. Other than that, we leave him alone. Let him get in his place and prepare the way he always prepares. It’s what suits him. He knows we’re thinking about him. Courtney took a knock to his knee on Saturday night. I don’t really know the extent of it until they officially say what’s gone on, but he was walking in the evening and seemed fine. We’ll just wait and see what Stuart Lancaster says. Proud: Valerie at Twickenham These past few days, my thoughts have been going back to when Courtney was a boy. We are a sturdy bunch and don’t have too many illnesses, just the usual childhood ones – he got all of four chickenpox spots – and, of course, those niggles that come with being a tall youth whose ligaments take longer to catch up with his bones when he has a growth spurt. But it doesn’t matter how big Courtney gets, he will always be my boy. Courtney as a boy Courtney likes his West Indian food, and when he was growing up he would help in the kitchen with me and my husband Linford, who’s an excellent cook. We have lots of jerk chicken, jerk pork, rice and peas, ackee and saltfish, curried goat. All the good old West Indian recipes. I do manage to find goat meat in Northampton. As a child, Courtney was very shy and never had too much to say , but I can remember when he was about two years old, on holiday playing cricket, and he could catch and throw a ball better than some of the adults. He had great hand/­eye coordination so I shouldn’t have been surprised when sport featured so predominantly in his life. At Northampton School For Boys, which he went to at the age of 13, he would walk into the classroom carrying a rugby ball. The teacher would reprimand him saying: “Can you write with that rugby ball, Mr Lawes?” Thank goodness he kept carrying the ball. They were fun days, travelling all over the country from Wakefield to Wareham with the school team, Old Scouts, and then through East Midlands and the England age groups. We have met some lovely people at every level he reached, and it was such an achievement and a privilege to have been travelled this path with him. That all came into focus on Saturday. All those miles, the trials, the age­groups, all those days of him growing, and being there for him every step of the way. How Courtney prepares He’s always been the same. He finds that music helps him get into the zone and has some playlists that he listens to. I think he listens to an eclectic mix of R&B, urban music. He likes to be quiet and concentrate on the job in hand. I asked Jess, his partner, when I saw her before the game: “How is Courtney?” She said: “Same as usual.” You wouldn’t know he was playing that day. He’s very cool and he deals with it in his own way. He seems to take the emotion out of it. Bitter blow: Courtney leaves the field Photo: Getty Right from the beginning at Twickenham on Saturday, I’d never heard the singing so loud. I think the English voices were even louder than the Welsh. As soon as they started singing, we started singing. It was like a competition. The atmosphere was electric, the banter was great. You couldn’t fault it. As the game went on, you could see people’s nerves were getting frayed. Ours certainly were. The England players’ families are scattered throughout one stand. You can hear what people are saying around you. I don’t think we all enjoyed the result, but we enjoyed the game. Courtney and [Wales flanker] George North are very good friends – but I don’t think it makes any difference on the field. Any player will tell you that on the field it’s all about the team and strategy. As soon as the game ends, they will shake hands and carry on as usual, such is the “gentleman’s code” in the game. England are still in with a shout in the Rugby World Cup. They have every confidence in what they’re doing. It’s just how the cards fell on the day, and they still have it all to play for. I know what Courtney is like. He never, ever gives up. • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T21:00:18.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
