Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Sep 04, 2015 eTN   \nSafety in African aviation is not something easily taken for granted and with the average rate of aviation incidents still way above global average is it all but clear that more needs to be done to improve safety standards. Both IATA (International Air Transport Association) and AFRAA, the African Airline Association, are engaged with member airlines in Africa and offer specific training initiatives all aimed to add skills to the workforce across the board and improve competences. \nIn November of this year, AVIASSIST is coming to Rwanda, where several training courses, combined with a general aviation conference, will give airlines in the wider Eastern African region, and also those coming from further, the opportunity to send staff to learn about such crucial issues like IATA Dangerous Goods, Flight Data Management, and Airworthiness Certification. \nThe “Safety in African Aviation” conference will take place in Kigali, Rwanda, on November 19-20, preceded by two courses, Airworthiness Certification from November 16-18, and Flight Data Management from November 17-18. After the main conference is over, the AVIASSIST Foundation will then offer an extended course on the topic of IATA Dangerous Goods, the importance of which has grown as a result of incidents with batteries and other dangerous items loaded onboard aircraft as cargo. This course spans from November 23-27, and airlines in the region have the opportunity to nominate staff, or staff keen on self-development to sign up themselves. \nThe course content will include the following: \n• apply the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations correctly \n• differentiate between shipper’s and operator’s responsibilities \n• identify dangerous goods which are: \n- forbidden from air transport - allowed as cargo for air transport - excepted from the Regulations \n• apply the basic principles to identify and classify the dangerous goods \n• apply the general and specific packing requirements or verify that they have been complied with \n• complete the required Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods or verify that this document have been prepared in accordance with the regulations \n• Follow safety and emergency procedures", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T04:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:45:17.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
