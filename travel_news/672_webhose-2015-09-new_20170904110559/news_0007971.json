It then made an emergency landing at Denpasar.\nCathay Pacific said there was no fire on board, and all 251 passengers and crew were safe and unharmed.\nThe airline said an engine defect caused flight CX170, an Airbus A330 aircraft, which left Perth just before midnight, to be diverted to Denpasar, where it was met by firefighters.\nOne of the passengers said that there was a loud bang, followed by flames. As many people started freaking out by the mid-air drama, the pilot announced that power to one of the engines had been lost, and then all the power in the cabin went off.\nHowever, Cathay Pacific has rejected suggestions there was a fire on board or in the engine.\nThe airline said that the passengers were provided with hotel accommodation while the authority was addressing the issue. They affirmed that safety remains the highest priority for Cathay Pacific and the authority is currently investigating the incident.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T11:35:36.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
