The company, which already announced plans to suspend operations in the country, owns more than 70% of Mopani Copper Mines — the largest employer after the government — that produces 26% of the nation’s output of the metal.\n\"The precipitous decline in Glencore’s share price has intensified selling pressure\" on the kwacha, Celeste Fauconnier and Nema Ramkhelawan-Bhana, economists at Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, said in a note to clients on Tuesday. \"Glencore’s apparent balance sheet woes increase the likelihood of job cuts at its Mopani mine.\"\nZambia’s economy has been beset by turmoil this year triggered by a slide in copper prices. The metal makes up 70% of the nation’s export income and falling revenue has pushed up government debt to levels causing discomfort for investors. Moody’s Investors Service cut the country’s credit rating last Friday to B2, five steps below investment grade.\nThe kwacha fell 2.8% to 12.335/$ on Tuesday afternoon, taking its decline this year to 48%, the most of more than 150 currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Copper has fallen 21% this year in London.\nGlencore said on September 7 it planned to suspend operations in Zambia and at Katanga Mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for 18 months. The company has been in talks with the government and labour unions on plans to cut about 3,800 of the 20,000 jobs at Mopani.\n\"With the benefit of hindsight, we can see how the kwacha’s fortunes have become tied closely to that of Glencore’s,\" Gareth Brickman, a market analyst at ETM Analytics in Stamford, Connecticut, said.\nCompounding Zambia’s problems is its worst power shortage yet. The country generates almost half of its electricity from a hydropower plant at Lake Kariba, which is less than a third full because of drought.\nBarclays estimates the economy will expand 3.4% this year, while the budget deficit will soar to 8.4% of gross domestic product, almost double the state’s initial target of 4.6%.\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:55:51.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
