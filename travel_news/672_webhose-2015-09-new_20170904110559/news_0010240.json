With the entrance into its thirteenth market in the country, Virginia , Maryland and D.C. residents will now benefit from Beepi's national inventory of vehicles, local car inspectors and unparalleled customer service, facilitating secure and smooth transactions for people who want to avoid the old way of buying and selling a car. Consumers will also be able to take advantage of Beepi's generous 10-day money-back guarantee and the company's commitment to sell listed cars within 30 days.\nAs part of Beepi's national expansion, the Washington D.C. area will be the first region in the Northeast to have dedicated Beepi staffers on the ground to aid customers. Beepi performs an exhaustive 185-point inspection – the most rigorous in the category – by certified staff inspectors before any car is listed; guarantees all listed cars will sell within 30 days; provides a 3,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty for purchased vehicles and offers a 10-day money-back guarantee. Sellers receive free professional car photos, a set competitive price for their car and a guaranteed sale within a month without any hassle. To make this process as joyful as possible, buyers are updated on the status of their purchase every step of the way, culminating in the free delivery of a fully detailed car wrapped in a big bow and a personal car tour from a Beepi technician upon arrival.\nBeepi also offers strong consumer protection measures such as addressing recalls prior to delivery. Due to its commitment to transparency, the company last week stopped accepting diesel vehicles affected by the investigations into Volkswagen.\n\"With its discerning and highly mobile population, the nation's capital is the perfect place for Beepi. Its busy and often transient community needs a quick and reliable service to help them buy and sell cars without the frustration of wasting time going from dealership to dealership and filling out reams of paperwork,\" said Beepi CEO and co-founder Ale Resnik. \"We're excited to offer residents a trustworthy and simple way to buy and sell cars completely online.\"\n\"The company's decision to enter its thirteenth market was based on strong consumer demand for change in the auto industry,\" said co-founder Owen Savir. \"Buyers and sellers are eager to embrace new platforms that eliminate the frustrations of traditional dealerships, bringing the car buying experience in line with the way people purchase everything else, from electronics to clothes to groceries.\"\nAccording to a Beepi-commissioned national study on the attitudes of Americans who bought or sold a car in the last year, nearly 9 out of 10 people find the traditional car buying and selling process to be stressful and wish it could be a haggle-free experience. With Beepi, consumers have a complete end-to-end service that is entirely online and permits them to bypass the old-school car dealership model.\nAbout Beepi\nBeepi is the first startup to take on, and successfully disrupt, the pre-owned car industry. A peer-to-peer marketplace, Beepi is a way to buy or sell a quality car completely online, giving consumers a superior experience that is fast, secure and even fun.
