It can be an unnerving experience so it is useful to be prepared. First, make sure you understand how the system works. Employment tribunals determine disputes between employers and employees over employment rights. An employee can take an employer to an employment tribunal over various issues, including pay, dismissal and discrimination. The tribunal is independent and will listen to both sides before making a decision. If you lose the case, you may have to pay compensation or reinstate the employee. If you win, in most cases you will not be awarded compensation. But if the claimant acted unreasonably or their case had no hope of success, you can ask to be awarded costs. If you do find yourself facing a tribunal, get proper legal advice. Employment law is complex If possible, try to resolve the dispute through conciliation before it gets to a hearing, with the help of Acas (the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service), which can work with you and your employee to try to solve the problem without it going to a tribunal. If you do find yourself facing a tribunal, get proper legal advice. Employment law is complex so find a lawyer who has considerable experience in this area. Do not try to represent yourself. Many membership organisations, such as the Forum of Private Business and the Federation of Small Business, also offer legal advice to members, so consider joining one to access their independent support and guidance on employment law. Preparing for a tribunal can be extremely time-consuming so make sure you give yourself enough time to do it properly. You will need to prepare documents and call witnesses where relevant and you must give the employee seven days’ notice of any documents that you will be relying on as part of your case. If the employee is part of a pension scheme, you must bring full details of the scheme to the tribunal. If the employee is asking to be reinstated, you must say whether this is possible - and, if not, the reasons why. So think about it in advance. If at all possible, delegate the day-to-day running of your business to someone else while the tribunal is under way to ensure it is not adversely affected while your attention is elsewhere. A full description of the process can be found at Gov.uk . You can also call the employment tribunal inquiry line for general guidance on how the process works. The number is 0300 123 1024 in England and Wales and 0141 354 8574 in Scotland. Tracy Yates, consultant at national law firm Mills & Reeve, says that prevention is always better than cure: “The sheer volume of employment rules and regulations can be very daunting to SMEs, but the numbers of disputes reaching the employment tribunal has always been relatively small, with employers statistically winning more claims.\" On top of that at least 60pc fewer claims have been reaching tribunals since fees were introduced. That said, there are two simple rules which will keep employers out of the worst kind of trouble. First, if you have to let staff go, make sure you have an objectively fair reason for doing so, ideally one that you can defend with documentary evidence. Employees with less than two years’ service are not entitled to claim unfair dismissal, but there are many ‘day one’ rights, notably those that apply under our discrimination law. Second, treat all staff fairly and with respect throughout the employment relationship, but especially on termination. That can be a tough ask, but employers achieving that are less likely to receive claims. • Whatever obstacles you face, the right company car financed in the best way makes good business sense.
