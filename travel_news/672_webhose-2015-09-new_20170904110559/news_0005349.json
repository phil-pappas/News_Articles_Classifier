The fully customised camps, Steep & Deep Ski Camp and Backcountry Camp, take advantage of Jackson Hole’s world-class terrain and offer instruction from some of the best coaches and guides in the world.\nGuests of Four Seasons Resort Jackson Hole can book these experiences at any time throughout the winter season, excluding holidays, through Four Seasons. Four Seasons provides the perfect basecamp in between sessions, with luxury accommodations, slope-side access, award-winning dining and attentive service. Four Seasons will also customise each experience to the guest, from gourmet lunches to après-ski spa treatments.\nSteep & Deep Ski Camp\nAn intensive four-day camp designed to take advanced skiers to the next level, the Steep & Deep Ski Camp features the highest level of instruction from the world’s top ski coaches. Students will learn to master Jackson Hole’s famous technical terrain through expert guidance on topics such as finding the best line, reading a slope, steep skiing etiquette and terrain selection. Instructors will use their knowledge of the mountain and snow conditions to take skiers to optimal slopes, both on the resort’s famous pistes and also in the legendary Jackson backcountry. Highlights include the Hobacks, the Expert Chutes, and, on the last day, the infamous Corbet’s Couloir.\nBackcountry Camp\nThe Backcountry Camp is dedicated to providing skiers with the building blocks required to break away from in-bounds terrain and explore the backcountry on their own. The four-day experience is led by Jackson Hole’s professional backcountry guides, who teach everything from avalanche awareness to efficient touring and terrain selection. Each day consists of a perfect mix of skiing, touring, outdoor-based training and classroom learning. In addition, the camp includes exclusive early mountain access and rewards skiers with après-ski festivities.\nFor guests looking to round out their experience, Four Seasons Resort Jackson Hole also offers myriad activities off the slopes. Experiences such as Stargazing in Grand Teton National Park and Wildlife Safaris offer a unique take on winter in Jackson Hole, while the award-winning Spa, outdoor heated pool, and renowned Handle Bar lounge offer opportunities to relax and unwind. Room reservations at Four Seasons Resort and Residences Jackson Hole may be made online,", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:59:30.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
