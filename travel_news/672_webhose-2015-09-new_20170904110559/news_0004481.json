The findings demonstrate the need for trays to be cleaned between flights.\n\"What is needed is a procedure for increased efficiency of boarding and deplaning that gives the cabin crew more time to do a thorough cleaning between flights\", the study said.\nDrinking fountain buttons are the dirtiest things in airports \nIn airports, the least sanitary place by far to touch is drinking fountain buttons with 1,240 CFU/sq. inch, the research found.\nRead more:\nLightning bolt hits Delta Airlines passenger plane in video \nLoose nut causes $60m worth of damage to US military aircraft \nFlight attendants reveal the things they hate most about passengers Tests done by the National Science Foundation in the US show that the average home toilet seat has just 172 CFU/sq. inch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T08:37:48.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
