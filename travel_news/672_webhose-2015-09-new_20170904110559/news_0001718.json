They will also get a glimpse of what it's like to be an astronomer, using tools like a blink comparator and running tests to examine a collection of rocks. \nRisk is a big part of the exhibit, as guests will learn about three major impact stories from different periods of history – the Chicxulub crater (dinosaurs), Barringer Meteor Crater and the 1908 Tunguska Event above the surface of Siberia. \nA Google Maps display will let guests see what would happen if a comet or asteroid hit their town. They will also have the chance to \"save Earth\" by diverting a \"rubble pile\" asteroid while learning the role gravity plays. \nAnd clips from blockbuster disaster movies will be evaluated to see if Hollywood got science right. \nWho says science can't be fun? \nFor more astronomy fun, visitors can opt to upgrade to a combo ticket which includes viewings of \"Hubble 3D\" and \"Space Station 3D\" in MODS' IMAX 3D theater. \nFor more information, visit www.mods.org . \nFirst Colony: Our Spanish Origins at Florida Museum \nYou're no longer able to see a T. rex Named Sue at the Florida Museum of Natural History, but a new traveling exhibit is coming to Gainesville in October. \nFirst Colony: Our Spanish Origins details the colonization of St. Augustine in 1565. The historic site became our country's first enduring European settlement, long before Jamestown. \nThe exhibit will show how St. Augustine became America's original \"melting pot,\" featuring a multicultural society including Spaniards, free and enslaved Africans and Native Americans. \nFirst Colony opens Oct. 17 at the Florida Museum. The exhibit is currently on display at Government House Museum in St. Augustine. \nFor more information, visit www.flmnh.ufl.edu . \nWest wing reopening at MOAS \nThe west wing of the Museum of Arts & Sciences in Daytona Beach will reopen in October after being closed for reconstruction. \nThe renovated wing will be the new home for the museum's giant ground sloth skeleton, as well as the Cuban Foundation and the African artifacts exhibit. \nFor more information, visit www.moas.org .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T08:04:40.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
