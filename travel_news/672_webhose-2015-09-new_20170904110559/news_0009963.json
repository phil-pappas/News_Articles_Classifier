Although still a fraction of the global investment market, at around 1pc of the world’s financial assets, Islamic finance is now estimated to be worth £1.3trn, an increase of 150pc since 2006. The London Stock Exchange already boasts 53 Sukuk issues (Islamic bonds), raising more than $38bn. It has a mounting presence in Sharia-compliant Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) too, with seven available based on Islamic indices. In addition, Takaful (Islamic insurance) has reached a new high in the UK, with premiums estimated to have reached $30bn in 2012. At the first World Islamic Economic Forum outside the Middle East, held in London in 2013, David Cameron made clear the Government’s position on this global market, stating: “I don’t just want London to be a great capital of Islamic finance in the Western world, I want London to stand alongside Dubai and Kuala Lumpur as one of the great capitals of Islamic finance anywhere in the world.” This October will mark the two-year anniversary of the £200m sovereign Sukuk, a Government initiative announced at the London Forum. A global first outside the Islamic world, it was oversubscribed 10 times over, attracting £2.3bn of subscriptions from banks and sovereign wealth funds worldwide. A third of the take-up came from UK-based Islamic banks and 37pc came from Middle Eastern institutions. However, since the launch of the Sovereign Sukuk, there has been a general hush around the subject, with the Government not considering another one in the near future. While investors will find a number of other commercial funds to take its place, curiously, there remain few opportunities to invest in Sharia-compliant residential funds. This is despite the well-known love of residential among Muslim investors – with Qataris and Malaysians currently battling it out between Chelsea Barracks and Battersea Power Station. That gap in the market has been seized by the residential funds and asset manager, London Central Portfolio (LCP). Its CEO, Naomi Heaton, has already successfully launched two Sharia-compliant offerings and is clear on the opportunities offered by the market: “Muslims make up 25pc of the world’s population and the Islamic finance industry is growing 50pc faster than the commercial banking sector. Curiously, there are few opportunities to invest in Sharia-compliant residential funds in the UK. This gap has been seized by Asset Manager, London Central Portfolio Muslim institutional and retail wealth is increasingly mobile. Political instability – particularly in the oil-dependent Gulf states – is also encouraging Middle Eastern investors to actively look at opportunities to diversify into global markets.” she says. The growing demand for Islamic products, specifically in the UK, is also propelled by the demographic transformation taking place. More than one third of all SMEs in London are believed to be Muslim-owned, with British Muslims contributing at least £30bn to the economy. The British Government has launched Sharia-compliant baby bonds under its Child Trust Fund scheme and, in 2012, began offering Muslim workers a Sharia-compliant pension fund in the public sector. Al Rayan Bank (formerly known as the Islamic Bank of Britain), introduced the first Sharia-compliant cash ISA. It’s no surprise, then, that LCP is now launching LCA III, its latest Sharia-compliant offering targeting the private rented sector in the area designated by LCP as “Prime Central London”, which covers the boroughs of Kensington and Chelsea, and the City of Westminster. It is the only one of its kind in the UK and will include a seed portfolio of 40 one- and two-bedroom apartments in areas such as Mayfair and Knightsbridge. It is expected to deliver returns to investors of 12pc IRR per annum over the next five years. It is probably also no surprise that it is receiving finance from the Qatari-backed Al Rayan Bank. The Quote: d investment company, with a projected fund raise of £100m, is open to investors globally for the next six months directly or through ISAs, SIPPs, SASSs, and offshore pension schemes. As with the Government’s Sukuk, the investor base for LCP’s previous two Sharia-compliant funds has been diverse, drawing subscriptions from the UK as well as the Far and Middle East and from both conventional and Islamic investors. Faizal Karbani, founder and CEO of wealth manager Simply Sharia, says: “LCP is providing access to a unique and attractive asset class while ensuring the fund remains within the bounds of Sharia statute. As a bricks-and-mortar product, often preferred by Muslim investors, the fund is a perfect recipe for us.” • For more information on LCP’s one-stop service or investing in their new fund, London Central Apartments III, go to londoncentralportfolio.com or follow them on Twitter @LCP_Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T14:23:36.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
