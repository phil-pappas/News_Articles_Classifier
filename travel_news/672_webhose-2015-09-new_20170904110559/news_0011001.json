For the third year in a row, a beer festival atmosphere will take over in Pier Z in Terminal 1 and the non-Schengen part of Terminal 2. This year, the right mood will be evoked by original Bavarian music played by two ensembles: the Bayernsturmer, a brass band specialized in traditional music, and the Wiesenschwestern, a charming group of female vocalists. Both will entertain passengers at the airport with catchy tunes for four weeks. \nA taste of Bavaria will also be available at restaurants and bistros serving Bavarian specialties including white sausage, leberkase, sauerkraut, giant soft pretzels, and Oktoberfest beer fresh from the tap. In addition, festively decorated marketplaces laden with attractive wares will entice passengers to shop with a passion. Promoters dressed in dirndls and lederhosen will hand out multilingual leaflets containing exclusive Oktoberfest coupons that guests can immediately redeem in any participating shop or restaurant here at the airport. \nThe Oktoberfest activities are yet another module of the “Great to have you here!” service program that the airport’s operator, Fraport, launched years ago to steadily improve and enhance the customer experience at Germany’s largest transportation hub. Other excellent examples include the Frankfurt Airport App 2.0 and free 24-hour Wi-Fi for everyone. \nMore details about Frankfurt Airport’s wide range of services and facilities are available via FRA’s travel website and the social media channels on Twitter , Facebook , Youtube , Pinterest , and Instagram .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T22:51:27.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
