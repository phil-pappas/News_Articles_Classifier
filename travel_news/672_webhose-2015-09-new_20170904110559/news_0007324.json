The caterer reported a large number of client renewals at the beginning of the year, resulting in a revenue value of £25m for the next five years. Winning new business in 2015 also contributed to Fare of London’s financial success, with the acquisition of a five-year contract with new London events venue Farmers and Fletchers in the City. \nThe success of the company’s 25th anniversary campaign and its Celebration of Forgotten Fare events (which saw over 300 event professionals visit two of Fare of London’s client venues, and sample some of the forgotten food recipes) have also been contributing factors in driving new business for the company’s client venues. This year’s revenue increase follows a 20% year-on-year revenue increase for the company last financial year, ending in August 2014. Fare of London’s Managing Director John Durden says: “We’re delighted to have enjoyed such great success this year, particularly as it’s the 25th anniversary of the company. This is testament to the economic upturn as well as the hard work of our staff, who all contributed to the client renewals and contract wins we have achieved this year, as well as their dedication in making our 25th anniversary Forgotten Foods campaign a great success.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T14:01:44.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
