Flight JD407 took off from Hangzhou Xiaoshan Airport at 1.35pm local time on September 3rd, bound for Copenhagen,and marked the official opening of the first direct flight between Hangzhou and the Danish capital. The twelve hour flight from Hangzhou arrived in Copenhagen at 9:15pm local time before making the return journey later that evening. \nThe flight is scheduled to depart Hangzhou weekly on Thursday. In July 2015, Beijing Capital Airlines introduced its first A330 passenger planes, with a two cabin layout and 222 seats,toits existing fleet of 52 narrow body planes. It was an A330 that will take passengers between Hangzhou and Copenhagen. A ceremony was held at Hangzhou’s Shangri-La Hotel to commemorate the opening which was attended by representatives from Beijing Capital Airlines, Nordic Tourism Bureau, the Zhejiang and Hangzhou governments as well as civil aviation and airport staff. Speaking at the launch event, XuXin, Executive Chairman atCapital Airlines said, “In the future, Capital Airlines will leverage the Hangzhou hub and the introduction of30 wide body A330 and A350 aircraft to develop a mature route network covering Europe and other popular tourist destinations around the world.” The Chinese Ambassador to Denmark, Liu Biwei added that, “The new route will enhance bilateral relations between the two regions and encourage greater economic, trade and cultural cooperation. The number of Chinese tourists visiting Denmark has increased significantly over the last few years and tourism is an important contributor to relations between our two countries. We hope that this new route can further enhance tourism cooperation between the two regions.” The Hangzhou to Copenhagen direct flight is the first non-stop flight between the two cities and it is hoped that this new route will mean stronger links between the Yangtze River region surrounding Hangzhou and Northern Europe.Denmark’s capital, Copenhagen is steeped in history and culture and as the most important air traffic hub in North-Western Europe is a vital gateway to Scandinavia and also has strong transport links to Germany, including important cities likeBerlin and Hamburg. In recent years, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have experienced a boom in outbound tourism and Hangzhou has become one of Eastern China’s most important cities. Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport is already the second largest airport in the region and Hangzhou itself is becoming a popular destination for international tourists. Capital Airlines is a public air transport enterprise formed in partnership by the Beijing Municipal Government and HNA Group and from its base in Beijing it has a route network of over 200 domestic and international destinations. Since 2014, the airline has been steadily expanding its international operations and in addition to the Hangzhou to Copenhagen non-stop route it also has international flights from Hangzhou to Shizuoka, Okinawa and Cheju. The new direct flight between Hangzhou and Copenhagen is the latest development in Capital Airline’s on-going strategy to link international tourist destinations.
