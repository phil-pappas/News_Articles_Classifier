The youngest child was about four years old.\nThe flooding ravaged a community that straddles the border from Hildale, Utah, to Colorado City, Arizona.\nMost of the people who live in the community are members of the Warren Jeffs polygamist sect known as the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (FLDS).\nThe flash flood started with heavy rains Monday evening in the canyons above Hildale, Barlow said. The rush of water was so intense it washed two vehicles several hundred yards downstream.\nThe two vehicles were carrying 16 people, Barlow said.\n“Most of the people were thrown from the vehicles,” Barlow said.\nWitness Chris Wyler said rain and hail walloped Hildale within minutes — then quickly subsided.\n“It happened within like a half-hour, 45 minutes,” he said. “(Then) it was just gone. And then the sun was shining again.”\nBy late Monday night, he said, the water had mostly receded. Nearby residents were trying to organize volunteers on social media to help search for those missing.\nA flash flood warning remained in effect for Short Creek, Hildale and the surrounding region of southeast Washington County, Utah, until noon (2 p.m. ET), the National Weather Service said.\nAdditional thunderstorms are expected in the area Tuesday afternoon, the service added.\nUtah Gov. Gary R. Herbert said the state was offering “all its resources to Hildale in order to aid with the search and rescue effort”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T01:26:53.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
