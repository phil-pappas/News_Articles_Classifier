Tourists from Europe and Japan love it there. \nThis resort turned into a place of horror on Tuesday, when tourists from Canada, the manager of the resort (a Norwegian), and a Filipino woman were kidnapped and forced onto an outrigger at gunpoint and taken from the resort. \nThis was according to a report by AP. The victims were identified as John Ridsel and Robert Hall from Canada, and the resort manager is Kjartan Sekkingstad. The Filipino woman has not yet been identified. \nThe Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs said the federal government is aware of reports that Canadians were kidnapped in the Philippines and is \"pursuing all appropriate channels to seek further information.\" \nTwo Japanese resort guests unsuccessfully tried to intervene before the gunmen escaped with their hostages aboard a motorized outrigger from Samal Island near Davao City. \nThe gunmen appeared to have specifically targeted the victims when they entered the Oceanview Samal resort before midnight on Monday located at the northern tip of the island, about 975 kilometers southeast of Manila. \nA naval blockade was set up around the island to stop the kidnappers from reaching Basilan Island farther to the southwest where the militants have strongholds where they keep hostages while negotiating ransoms. \nMilitants in this region are still holding other hostages, including two Malaysians, a Dutch bird watcher that was kidnapped nearly three years ago, and a town mayor. \nAccording to statements from military sources, the gunmen spoke English and Tagalog, but the group’s affiliation was not yet known. There were 30 foreign tourists at the resort at the time of the attack. \nNavy ships have been deployed to search for the gunmen’s boat, as well as for potential landing sites in southeastern Mindanao. \nIn 2014, a peace agreement with the largest Muslim rebel group in the south ended 45 years of conflict that had killed about 120,000 people and displaced 2 million in the Davao region. Up until recently, the region had been relatively peaceful for over 10 years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T06:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T07:24:00.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
