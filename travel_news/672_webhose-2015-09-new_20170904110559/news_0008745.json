Clark Binoculars offer visitors a chance to see more of Horicon Marsh from the visitor center off Highway 28 at the southeastern corner of the 33,000-acre reserve. By Brian E. Clark (0) Comments Brian E. Clark A sculpture of an American Indian stands outside the newly renovated Horicon Marsh Education and Visitor Center near Horicon. It includes an interactive, 4,000-square-foot Explorium. \nOutside the renovated Horicon Marsh Education and Visitor Center , a fierce-looking American Indian hunter stands poised with a spear, ready to do battle. But he's not there to keep interlopers away. Look to his right about 30 feet and you'll see a life-size woolly mammoth, which he is presumably about to slay. \nThe mammoth and hunter sculptures — created by Curt Walker and Tim Summerville respectively — are aimed at enticing people inside the building, which sits on a small rise above the southeastern corner of the 33,000-acre watery reserve — the largest intact cattail marsh in the United States. The area has a global reputation, too, as a United Nations-designated Wetland of International Importance. \nBut the sculptures are just the tip of the spear point. Inside the remodeled former medical clinic — which opened Aug. 22 — is an interactive, 4,000-square-foot Explorium on the lower floor that makes this facility the crown jewel of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources' visitor centers. The Explorium cost nearly $4 million, of which about $1 million was paid for by gifts from members of the Friends of Horicon Marsh, local businesses and other donors. \nThe top floor was also redone, DNR wildlife supervisor Bret Owsley told me and two of my kids when we toured the facility recently. Displays now lead to huge, atrium-like windows that overlook the expansive marsh, 11,000 acres of which are owned by the DNR. The 22,000 acres to the north are controlled by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. \nDisplays include an osprey nest, similar to a real one in marsh. There's also a display of the live-streaming camera that broadcasts heron chicks at the marsh's heron rookery in the spring. In addition, a flock of Canada geese appear to be flying high in the atrium. \nFor those who want to know where migratory birds go when they aren't in the marsh, an interactive touchscreen reveals that some shorebirds fly all the way to California or Central America. \nThere are also other displays, including a pair of long marsh skis used for hunting and a play area dedicated to small kids. \nBut the best part of the center is the Explorium, which was created by Taylor Studios of Rantoul, Ill., and covers thousands of years of natural and human history. The first thing visitors see when they descend the stairs is a lifelike model of DNR wildlife educator Liz Herzmann kneeling in tall grass, uncovering a Clovis spear point. \nThen it's on to a tunnel that leads through a re-creation of the glacier that covered the region up until about 12,000 years ago and scraped out the shallow basin that became Horicon Marsh. Not long after the ice retreated, wildlife moved in and native people followed to hunt the birds and larger critters — including the mammoth. \nThis part of the Explorium includes a fossilized mammoth tooth and 10,000-year-old Clovis points that were found in the marsh. It also has interactive displays that tell about the thousands of effigy mounds the native people built later in the region, including the uplands around the marsh. \nA voice that sounds like actor Morgan Freeman (it's really Jason Stephens of Madison) narrates the walk through the Explorium, starting with the glacial tunnel. \nIt wasn't long after European settlers arrived in the early 1800s that they began to alter the landscape, including the marsh. They dammed the Rock River — which flows out of the wetlands — in the 1840s to create what was then the largest man-made lake in the country. \nThe poorly constructed dam failed several times, flooding irate farmers downstream and prompting legal battles that led to a decision by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 1869 that mandated the removal of the dam. The marsh returned to its natural state and waterfowl hunting boomed. The Explorium has artifacts from shooting clubs, including an interactive duck-call display. \nBut commercial hunters killed so many of the birds and other animals that their populations plummeted. To shoot waterfowl, they used a \"punt gun,\" basically a huge shotgun that could kill numerous birds with one shot. The Pioneer Limited train ran from Horicon to Milwaukee with thousands of ducks in barrels. Visitors can open replicas of the barrels to learn more about this period. \nWhat came next was an ecological disaster for the marsh, Owlsley said. A 14-mile-long main channel and smaller side channels were dredged in the 1920s to drain the wetland for farming. The carrot, onion and potato crops thrived the first year but soon failed, Owlsley said. \nWorse, the dried-out peat soil spontaneously combusted when it was exposed to heat and oxygen. The fields burned for years, deep into the ground, fouling the air and leaving a charred and ruined landscape. Motion-activated sensors release the odor of burning peat in this section, giving visitors a pungent sensation from that smokey period. \nThanks to the efforts of men like Curly Radke, a Horicon native and head of the local Izaak Walton League, the DNR acquired thousands of acres of the desolated area in 1927 and later flooded it behind a new, smaller dam to re-create the marsh. \nOwsley said one of the most popular parts of the Explorium so far is the simulated air boat ride facing an 18-foot-wide screen with synchronized video of the marsh. When we toured, a pair of youngsters squealed with delight as they sped through the marsh with a fan whipping up their hair. \nOther hands-on displays deal with irrigation systems in the wetland. And for kids, there's a muskrat hut with a live turtle swimming above it and a room with a pair of monstrous heron legs and a giant beak. \n\"We're really pleased with how it all turned out,\" Owsley said. \"We want people to gain an appreciation of the natural world and learn about the conservation and hunting heritage of this area. Hopefully, folks who come here will also pick up an activity brochure and venture out into the marsh to hike, bike, paddle, go birding and experience it for themselves.\" \nMore information: The center is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. The visitor center is free, but the Explorium is $6 for adults and $4 for children ages 5 to 17. Families (two adults and two children) are $15. \nFor more, call (920) 387-7890 or see horiconmarsh.org.
