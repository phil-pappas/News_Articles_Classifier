This is something that Egencia understands and incorporates in its technology and services for business travellers and their companies. We feel it is our role to help business travellers, not just search for what they’re looking for, but find it,” he said.\nThe study also found hotels that can “provide an enjoyable online booking experience is essential” to attracting British business travellers.\nThe online study was conducted among 8,030 business travellers from June 26 to July 15.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T19:52:01.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
