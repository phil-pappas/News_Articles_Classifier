Students will then use a STIXX machine, an environmentally innovative system that turns newspapers into building rods, and work in groups to translate their designs into reality. \nSundeep Sangha, Heathrow’s Head of Economic Development, says: ‘Heathrow is committed to reducing skills gaps in engineering and technology and in doing so helping the local economy, as well as raising academic achievements and aspirations of young people. \nThe Primary School Challenge is a wonderful example of how we do this; it complements the Key Stage 2 curriculum, and improves participants’ decision making, creativity and self confidence, all skills which they can develop and use in the workplace in years to come.’ \nOver the years, 20,741 year 5 & 6 students have benefitted from the skills taught in the Challenge. \nHeathrow’s Primary School Challenge Programme has been awarded the 2014 Malcolm Gibbons Cup in the Spark! Partnership Awards, which highlight leading examples of successful collaboration between education and the local business community. \nThe Primary School Challenge is part of the Heathrow Community Investment Programme, which aims to support the economic prosperity of local people surrounding the airport. The main aim is to raise aspirations and academic achievement by positively engaging with local schools, colleges and universities to promote the airport as an attractive career destination to local young people, their parents and other job seekers.
