It’s open daily from 7am to 10pm, and you’ll also find food trucks, a bar, ping-pong tables and frequent live concerts held there. For a more traditional art experience, the Museum of Fine Arts Boston (MFA) is home to masterpieces by Hopper, Monet, John Singer Sargent and Winslow Homer and is free on Wednesday nights after 4pm . It also offers one free repeat visit within 10 days, free admission to all aged 17 and under on weekends and weekdays after 3pm.\nFor the kids … The Make Way for Ducklings statues in Boston Public Garden. Photograph: Alamy\nStroll around the Boston Commons , the oldest public park in the US. Feed the ducks, ride the swan boats, see the beloved Make Way for Ducklings statues (on the adjoining Boston Public Garden), enjoy the playgrounds and take a ride on the carousel near Frog Pond for $3. Play in Frog Pond’s fountain during the warmer months, or skate on its ice rink in the winter – admission is $5 for anyone over 58in, and renting adult skates costs $10. The Children’s Museum is a great indoor activity, delighting kids for hours with its bubble room, life-size Japanese House, three-storey playground and more. Visit on Friday nights from 5pm-9pm and the whole family gets in for $1.\nEat centrally Tyler Street in Boston’s Chinatown. Photograph: Alamy\nThe scores of sights and activists in central Boston can leave you famished, but it is possible to find affordable cafes, diners and restaurants in the centre of the city. Chinatown, which is near the Theatre District, the Boston Commons, the Financial District and the trendy South End, has numerous inexpensive but good-quality restaurants. Squeeze into the crowded Gourmet Dumpling House (52 Beach St, +1 617 338 6223, on Facebook ), a local favourite where all lunch specials cost $7.95, or enjoy some dim sum at China Pearl (9 Tyler St, +1 617 426 4338): small dishes are $3.50 and large are $5.25. If you’re on the other side of town in Brookline, the legendary Anna’s Taqueria (1412 Beacon St and 446 Harvard St, +1 617 739 7300/617 277 7111) does a regular burrito at $5.95. While there are many restaurants near historic Faneuil Hall , not all of them are as cheap or as sumptuous as Saus (33 Union St, +1 617 248 8835), which specialises in homemade french fries. A large order of fries is $7, and a sandwich is $8.\nDrink like a local The Samuel Adams brewery. Photograph: Boston Globe via Getty Images\nThe famous Samuel Adams brewery gives free tours and tastings with a recommended $2 donation to help local charities. A lesser known brewery worth getting to know is Night Shift Brewing in Everett, a 10-minute ride on the Orange Line from central Boston and a 15-minute walk from the Wellington Station stop. It has a similar policy to Samuel Adams: asking for a $1 (or non-perishable food item) donation to help benefit the Greater Boston Food Bank. The unusual flavours (think beer brewed with oysters), outdoor patio with local food trucks and a taproom featuring arcade games, board games and a bean bag toss more than make up for its banal neighbourhood.\nTour the library Photograph: Alamy\nThe Boston Public Library is a beautiful building in the centre of Boston, and the second largest library in the US. Created in 1885 as a “palace for the people”, John Singer Sargent murals, which the artist considered to be his greatest oeuvre, grace the third floor. The magnificent courtyard is decorated with Italianate white arches, the coffee shop is a map room and there are always two or three free exhibitions organised. Free tours are available every day .\nGet to know the coast The beaches of Salem are a 30-minute train ride from Boston. Photograph: Cindy Goff/Alamy\nSalem’s cobblestone streets, colourful colonial houses and peculiar history of witchcraft allegations set it apart from other picturesque New England towns by the sea. A 30-minute ride on the commuter rail from North Station ($14 return), the town has many unusual boutiques, cafes and psychic shops reflecting its past. Beach bums should go to Revere Beach, which was made the first public beach in the US in 1896, right on the Blue Line at either the Wonderland stop or Revere Beach station. Get in line at Kelly’s when the salty air works up your appetite – it has been a local institution for decades; the crab rolls are $11.95 and a large roast beef sandwich is $8.95.\nGo to a show Annie Clark, aka St Vincent. Photograph: Suzi Pratt/WireImage\nBostonians love comedy, so it’s no wonder that comedians such as Louis CK, Conan O’Brien and Amy Poehler all started out in the Boston area. Get a taste of some Boston humour at Improv Boston , where The People’s Show on Sundays, featuring old and new talent, is pay by donation. Its other shows cost from $10-$18. If you’re less into laughs and more into music, look for one of the many free concerts at different venues around the city by the Berklee College of Music , which counts among its alumni John Mayer, Annie Clark (aka St Vincent) and two members of Aerosmith.\nExplore the Emerald Necklace The Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University. Photograph: Boston Globe via Getty Images\nDesigned by the US’s first landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmsted, the Emerald Necklace is a series of parks of over 1,000 acres, such as the Arnold Arboretum , owned by Harvard University just south of the Jamaica Plain neighbourhood. Climb Peters Hill, inside the Arboretum, for a fantastic view of the Boston skyline. On the other side of Jamaica Plain is Jamaica Pond , a picturesque body of water formed by a glacier. The Back Bay Fens , next to the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, is another great spot for a promenade along the water or a picnic in its rose garden.\nWhere to stay on the cheap The Hi Hostel Boston\nThe Hi Hostel Boston , downtown in the theatre district, offers spaces in a six-person dorm from $42.49 a night (this jumps to $199.49 for a private room). The Friend Street Hostel , next to North Station and the sports and entertainment complex TD Garden , starts at $45 a night in a dorm (mixed or by gender), but does not offer private rooms.\nExperience Boston’s history The USS Constitution. Photograph: Boston Globe via Getty Images\nAs one of the oldest cities in the nation, Boston has a lot of history-related activities to offer. The Freedom Trail , a red line on the sidewalk that runs (for 2.5 miles) past the city’s historical landmarks, is the first activity Bostonians will mention. While walking along the red line costs nothing, there are daily public tours that cost $14 for adults. Another inexpensive way to engage with Boston’s past is a visit to the USS Constitution (for non-US visitors a passport is required to board the vessel), a famous battleship from the American revolutionary war, which is free of charge.", "external_links": ["http://www.hiusa.org/massachusetts/boston/boston",
