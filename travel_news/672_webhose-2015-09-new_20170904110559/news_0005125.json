(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson, File) Nearly a decade and a half after hijacked planes hit the World Trade Center's twin towers, the Pentagon and a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, the anniversary continues to be marked with observances around the country.\nThe Flight 93 National Memorial near Shanksville in western Pennsylvania is marking the completion of its visitor center, which opened to the public Thursday. At the Pentagon, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter and other officials will join in remembrances for victims' relatives and Pentagon employees.\nPresident Barack Obama is scheduled to observe the anniversary with a visit to Fort Meade, Maryland, in recognition of the military's work to protect the country.\nFILE- In this Sept. 11, 2014 file photo, visitors to the National September 11 Memorial take photos of and observe the Tribute in Light from the South Pool on the 13th anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York. After years of private ceremonies for victims’ relatives and survivors to mark Sept. 11 at ground zero, the anniversary now also has become an occasion for the general public to revisit and reflect on the site of the terror attacks. (AP Photo/Julie Jacobson, File) Ohio's statehouse will display nearly 3,000 flags — representing the lives lost — in an arrangement designed to represent the World Trade Center towers, with a Pentagon-shaped space and an open strip representing the field near Shanksville. Sacramento, California, will commemorate 9/11 in conjunction with a parade honoring three Sacramento-area friends who tackled a heavily armed gunman on a Paris-bound high-speed train last month.\nIn Washington, some members of Congress plan to spend part of the anniversary discussing federal funding for the ground zero memorial. The House Natural Resources Committee has scheduled a hearing Friday on a proposal to provide up to $25 million a year for the plaza.\nThe memorial and underground museum together cost $60 million a year to run. The federal government contributed heavily to building the institution; leaders have tried unsuccessfully for years to get Washington to chip in for annual costs, as well.\nFILE- In this Sept. 11, 2014 file photo, the moon appears between the beams from the Tribute in Light memorial honoring the victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks as 1 World Trade Center, left, stands on the 13th anniversary as seen from Jersey City, N.J. The Tribute in Light, which first appeared on March 11, 2002, to mark the six months that had passed since the attacks. It has become a moving, quietly powerful element of the anniversaries since. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File) Under the current proposal, any federal money would go only toward the memorial plaza. An estimated 21 million people have visited it for free since its 2011 opening.\nThe museum charges up to $24 per ticket, a price that initially sparked some controversy. Still, almost 3.6 million visitors have come since the museum's May 2014 opening, topping projections by about 5 percent, Daniels said.\nAny federal funding could lead to expanded discounts for school and other groups, but there are no plans to lower the regular ticket price, he said.\nFILE- In this Sept. 11, 2014 file photo, a visitor to the World Trade Center complex in New York sits in the grass as a Tribute in Light rises from behind the surrounding buildings. An estimated 20,000 people flocked to the memorial plaza on the anniversary evening in 2014, the first year the public was able to visit on the day. (AP Photo/Julie Jacobson, File) This year's anniversary also comes as advocates for 9/11 responders and survivors are pushing Congress to extend two federal programs that promised billions of dollars in compensation and medical care. Both programs are set to expire next year.\nBut some of those close to the events aim to keep policy and politics at arm's length on Sept. 11.\nOrganizers of the ground zero ceremony decided in 2012 to stop letting elected officials read names, though politicians still can attend. Over the years, some victims' relatives have invoked political matters while reading names — such as declaring that Sept. 11 should be a national holiday — but others have sought to keep the focus personal.\nFILE- In this Sept. 11, 2014 file photo, a visitor to the National September 11 memorial, pans his phone while shooting video of One World Trade Center and surrounding buildings on the 13th anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York.
