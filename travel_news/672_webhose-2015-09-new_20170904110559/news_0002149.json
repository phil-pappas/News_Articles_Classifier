The Portland Press Herald reports the Massachusetts Medical Examiner's Office plans to perform an autopsy on the 59-year-old's body.

They say the ship left Boston Friday afternoon and was bound for Bar Harbor, Maine. An FBI spokeswoman says her agency has nothing more to say until the autopsy is completed. The identity and hometown of the woman have not been released. One of Seabourn's other ships, the Odyssey.
