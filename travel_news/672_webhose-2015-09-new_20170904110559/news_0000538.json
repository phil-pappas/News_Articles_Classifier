Compared with traditional vehicles, Fosjoas intelligent scooters are becoming popular. Many users haven’t satisfied with the short-distance trips on Fosjoas scooters. To meet users’ need, Moben has rolled out a new Fosjoas two-wheeled scooter U3. It is considered as the top of Fosjoas technology and design. Fosjoas U3 defines the mode of transportation in the future.Fosjoas intelligent electric scooters U3 look much rougher than other models. They are equipped with wider wheel hubs. The diameter of the wheel hub is 495mm. Although U3 looks big, the foldable aluminum alloy control shaft makes it light and durable. Fosjoas U3 still applies the original SONY/ Panasonic lithium batteries, whose battery capacity is 680Wh. The larger battery capacity provides U3 with longer range. And the most attractive point of Fosjoas U3 is that it has the largest output power in all models. The maximum peak of the motor is 1500W. Every 2-wheeled electric scooter can be rode very well on the flat road, but only U3 can makes users easily cross rough roads. What’s more, Fosjoas intelligent scooters U3 also considers the safety problems for riders. The industrial designers have added brake lights to U3. The brightness of U3’s brake lights are so high that one can see them easily even in the daytime. More importantly, it is completely automatic to control the taillights of U3. As long as one applies an emergency brake, the lights will be turned on by themselves. The automatic brake system protects the safety of both riders and passers-by. Besides, some other security elements are used in designing U3, such as seal circuit, waterproof and dustproof, dual chips and double battery protection plate. Without any doubt, users can have long-distance trips with Fosjoas 2-wheeled electric scooters U3. U3 will bring them a comfortable and safe cycling experience. # # #", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T04:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T13:51:23.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
