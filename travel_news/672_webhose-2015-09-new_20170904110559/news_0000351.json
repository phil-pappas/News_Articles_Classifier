It equates to five 30-minute workouts each week and it is thought that the majority of us simply don’t achieve it. We all lead such busy lives and, understandably, the biggest obstacle in the way of regular workouts is lack of time. But what if you could get some control back over your physical health in minutes rather than hours? Here is an example of a five-minute workout that could help you achieve just that, and it doesn’t even require any equipment because your own body weight provides the resistance you need to tone and strengthen core muscles. Minute one: 20 seconds of push ups, 10 seconds of rest, 20 seconds of push ups, 10 seconds of rest. Minute two: 20 seconds of squats, 10 seconds of rest, 20 seconds of squats, 10 seconds of rest. Minute three: Plank for as long as you can and then rest until the end of that minute. Minute four: 20 seconds of push ups, 10 seconds of rest, 20 seconds of push ups, 10 seconds of rest. Minute five: 20 seconds of lunges, 10 seconds of rest, 20 seconds of lunges, 10 seconds of rest. The plank Don’t know how to plank? Start off propped on your forearms, elbows in line with your shoulders, and your toes planted firmly. Resist the urge to crane your neck up or let your head droop down. Try staring at your fists to keep a good head position. If you do it right, your body should form a straight line from your head to your ankles. Floor exercise: the plank improves core strength Push ups For the perfect push up don't tuck in your chin or look straight ahead. Instead, pick a spot on the floor six to 10 inches in front of your fingers and keep your eyes focused on it as you perform the movement. This should keep your neck in a straight line with the rest of your body. Lunges For easy lunging, first stand with your feet shoulder's width apart, with your spine straight, your shoulders back and look forward. Then step forward with one leg into a wide stance while maintaining a straight spine. Finally lower your hips until both knees are bent at approximately a 90-degree angle. Your front knee should not extend over your ankle, and your back knee should hover above the ground. Keep your weight in your heels as you push back up to starting position. Repeat on both sides. WHY EXERCISE? Active people are thought to reduce their risk of heart disease by up to 40 per cent as opposed to their inactive counterparts. It is estimated that being on your feet for just three hours a day can extend your life by two years. Exercise helps to lower high blood pressure, thus potentially reducing the need for medication in some patients. • Learn about smart meters and find out how you can save money and time to spend on the things you love", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T21:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T17:03:01.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
