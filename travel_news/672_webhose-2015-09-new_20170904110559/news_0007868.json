Our whole kitchen brigade has worked day and night over the past year to retain this accolade and I am overjoyed at Michelin’s decision.”\nLawrence Huggler, owner of Bohemia, adds: “Jersey is renowned for its high standard of gourmet dining, and we are proud to be leading the charge in making Jersey a gastronomic destination on the world map. Keeping our Michelin star for an 11th year is an amazing achievement in itself but coming on the top of the fantastic rating, the highest ever for a Jersey restaurant in the Good Food Guide, makes this a special couple of weeks for us and Jersey.”\nSteve Smith has created a truly outstanding dining experience with his ingredient and flavour driven tasting menus including both vegetarian tasting menus as well as fish tasting menus. Bohemia Bar & Restaurant boasts a stellar reputation for its first rate cuisine, placing it firmly on the map as a food-lover’s destination. Situated on the ground floor of The Club Hotel & Spa, Bohemia has been Jersey’s finest dining establishment since opening its doors in April 2004.\nSource:- Visit Jersey", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:23:23.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
