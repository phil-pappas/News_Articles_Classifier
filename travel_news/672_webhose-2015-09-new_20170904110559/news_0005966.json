The Marriott Executive Apartments Addis Ababa will appeal to both business and family travelers with 108 fully serviced apartments offering space, ambience and the privacy of residential living enabling a comfortable stay away from home. \n\nLocated in the heart of Ethiopia's capital, the Marriott Executive Apartments Addis Ababa is just off Meskel Square in Bole, and is adjacent to the UN-ECA headquarters and conference center. It is a ten minute drive away from Bole International Airport, the African Union headquarters and the Ethiopian National Museum.\n\n\"This is the latest in a series of important landmark hotel signings and openings we have made in Africa. We are extremely proud to open the first Marriott Executive Apartments in Ethiopia in partnership with Sunshine Business,\" said Alex Kyriakidis, President and Managing Director Marriott International Middle East and Africa. \"Africa is important to Marriott International's growth strategy because of its rapid economic growth, growing middle class and youth population, as well as the expansion of international flights onto the continent.\"\n\nThe Marriott Executive Apartments Addis Ababa will provide residents with a choice of one and two-bedroom elegantly furnished serviced apartments, or the Penthouse Presidential Suite, each with a fully-equipped kitchen, free Wi-Fi, satellite TV, and includes services such as housekeeping, grocery shopping and room service. For business travellers, the property provides multi function meeting rooms and over 160 square metres of event space. \n\nSunshine Business President and Owner, Samuel Tafese, said, \"We are pleased to announce the opening of Ethiopia's first Marriott-branded property. Addis Ababa is one of the most vibrant cities in Africa and the Government's exceptional infrastructure spending make Addis an ideal place to conduct business.\"\n\nMarriott International has also announced that it will develop a property under the company's flagship brand, Marriott Hotels, in partnership with Sunshine Business. Expected to open by 2019, this property will reflect the new brand standards that Marriott Hotels has been rolling out globally since last year. Stylish, modern guest rooms and well-designed lobbies and public spaces known as 'Greatrooms' are some elements of the new brand standard. Marriott Hotels is also where mobile check-in and check-out was introduced, and most recently a mobile chat application, appealing to the next generation of travelers who blend work and play, who demand style and substance, and technology. Marriott Hotels has also launched a multi-year campaign called 'Travel Brilliantly' (www.travelbrilliantly.com), all created to amplify the brand's dedication to the future of travel.\n\nThe Marriott Hotels brand currently has four properties in North Africa, with over 2,000 rooms. By 2020, the company expects to open a further 12 properties across Africa, raising the room count by almost 3,000 rooms. The Addis Ababa Marriott Hotel will have 202 rooms, food and beverage outlets and significant conference and event facilities, accommodating up to 1100 delegates. \n\nKyriakidis continues, \"With over 850 million people in sub-Saharan Africa, there are enormous opportunities there. We are thrilled to be expanding on our partnership with Sunshine Business. This signing is a significant event for us as it represents the company's first Marriott Hotels property in Ethiopia, and comes in response to a rapidly increasing demand in the market, from both executive travellers as well as families who are looking for comfort and convenience during their travels.\"\n\nSunshine Business owner and EVP, Selamawit Samuel, commented, \"We are proud to open the first Marriott branded Hotel in Subâ€œSaharan Africa. Marriott is an outstanding brand which will add great and unique hospitality flair to the diplomatic capital of Ethiopia.\" \n\nAbout Marriott International \nMarriott International, Inc.
