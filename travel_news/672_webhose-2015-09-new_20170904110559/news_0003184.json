This year, 4,500 participants are expected to run, walk, wheel and ride through 2 km, 5 km and 10 km routes on Sunday, September 20, 2015. Hundreds of Four Seasons employees and their families will volunteer by registering runners, serving food and refreshments, and helping with the children’s play area. More than CAD 380,000 was raised in 2014, and to date, more than CAD 9.5 million has been raised through this run alone. Every dollar has gone directly to the Terry Fox Foundation.\nThis year’s pre-event campaign kicks off with members of the Four Seasons Terry Fox Committee joining the Terry Fox Foundation to open the Toronto Stock Exchange on September 14, 2015. Corporate donations remain an important part of fundraising efforts since 1980, when since Isadore Sharp personally pledged to Terry’s cause and wrote to 999 other Canadian executives urging them to support cancer research.\nOn September 20, award winning broadcaster Brian Bailey is back to host the Run day, along with Matt and Candice from the Indie 88.1 Street Team. Brian will introduce Isadore Sharp and special guests John Carmichael, MP for Don Valley West, and Terry’s Team Member Vinesha Ramasamy during the opening ceremonies beginning at 8:30 am. Fitness expert Sandra Adzievski will lead the warmup ahead of the 9:00 am official start.\nParticipants, volunteers and their families will enjoy entertainment by The Marc Joseph Band, Common Deer, The Muso Project and ONQ. Throughout the event, there will be complimentary breakfast and BBQ, children’s activities, parking shuttles, complimentary coat check and a massage tent.\nSource:-Four Seasons", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T03:15:41.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
