Just after midnight, the last westbound express departs from here - but only as far as Bristol Temple Meads. Fans are advised to spend seven-and-a-half hours at the station before boarding the first train on Sunday morning to Cardiff Central, where they arrive shortly before 10am.\nRead more Wales name XV to start against England Farrell replaces Ford at fly-half in England XV to face Wales Stuart Lancaster risks reputation with Sam Burgess gamble The same train operator infuriated fans heading to the Wales-Ireland game last Saturday in Cardiff.\nJohn Redmond was one of hundreds of passengers stranded at Bristol Parkway station for promised trains to the Welsh capital that did not materialise. “It is hard to conceive that the rail company had any type of plan going on here.” he told The Independent.\nA spokesman for the train operator, GWR, said: “Hundreds of additional trains, and hundreds of thousands of additional seats will run over the course of the tournament. Data from the sale of match tickets indicates less than 2 per cent of tickets for the England v Wales match have been sold in Wales.\n“Most fans from Wales are likely to choose to travel by alternative means, or stay overnight.”\nMore about: Rugby World Cup", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:34:19.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
