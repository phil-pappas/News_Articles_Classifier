Last August, archaeologists located two ancient Mayan cities that were lost for centuries under thick vegetation in a Mexican jungle.\nUnearthed in the southeast of the Mexican state of Campeche, the cities were barely accessible to the research team. But the challenging journey reaped great rewards, with the discovery of the ruins of a pyramid, palace, altars and a huge doorway, Discovery News reported.\nThe cities of Lagunita and Tamchen had been first been discovered by archeologist Eric Von Euw in the 1970s, however he didn’t specify their location and they remained quite the mystery\nMayan cities have been uncovered, including this “monster” mouth doorway.

The medieval city of Old Sarum in Salisbury, which dates back to the 12th century, was known to have been a bustling hive of activity, and the home of an ancient hill fort and military outpost.\n• China\nShi Cheng: the ancient underwater city 0:58 Play video\nTake a look at Chinas ancient city, Shi Cheng, which vanished underwater 53 years ago.

It was all because the government had decided they needed a new hydro-electric power station. The city lay directly in the firing line and was flooded when its valley was turned into a man-made lake.\nFounded about 1300 years ago, it now lies between 26 and 40 metres beneath the gorgeous Thousand Island Lake.\nBut it has a new lease on life now, being used now as an adventure park for tourists.\n ", "external_links": ["http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/excavation-of-rome-home-shows-city-bigger-than-thought/story-e6frfqbr-1227520601387?sv=c034a8a8f8cdfa404a173c8b7bd67bf8&title=Discovery+changes+what+we+know+about+Rome", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/excavation-of-rome-home-shows-city-bigger-than-thought/story-e6frfqbr-1227520601387?sv=c034a8a8f8cdfa404a173c8b7bd67bf8&h=Discovery+changes+what+we+know+about+Rome", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/excavation-of-rome-home-shows-city-bigger-than-thought/story-e6frfqbr-1227520601387?sv=c034a8a8f8cdfa404a173c8b7bd67bf8", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/excavation-of-rome-home-shows-city-bigger-than-thought/story-e6frfqbr-1227520601387?sv=c034a8a8f8cdfa404a173c8b7bd67bf8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content6.video.news.com.au/Q4bmlldzpvqLOioC2jWFChYXoQUnbMSn/promo265922909&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Discovery+changes+what+we+know+about+Rome&c=THIS+area+was+long+thought+to+have+been+used+only+as+a+necropolis%2C+but+the+discovery+of+a+6th-century+B.C.+residence+under+a+palazzo+has+changed+what+we+know+about+Rome.&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/excavation-of-rome-home-shows-city-bigger-than-thought/story-e6frfqbr-1227520601387?sv=c034a8a8f8cdfa404a173c8b7bd67bf8", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/excavation-of-rome-home-shows-city-bigger-than-thought/story-e6frfqbr-1227520601387?sv=c034a8a8f8cdfa404a173c8b7bd67bf8&title=Discovery+changes+what+we+know+about+Rome"], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T04:06:54.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
