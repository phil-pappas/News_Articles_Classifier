The ICCA Management Financial Committee Meeting will be hosted during the 2015 Taiwan MICE Week. The MICE Week is expected to bring 1,700 guests from Asia and generate tremendous business opportunities.\nIndustrial conferences in Taiwan are usually the best opportunities to gain early access to the Asian market. For example, the 12th World Filtration Congress, one of the most influential gatherings of the filtration industry worldwide. With 20 domestic and international media to participate in the congress, Taiwan will showcase its filtration industry competitiveness and promote the Taiwan MICE brand. The 12th World Filtration Congress in Taipei will serve to drive the whole industry and exhibitors can enter potential markets more effectively.\nMEET TAIWAN proceeds to organize more promotion and business matching events that enable Taiwan to stand out among other countries. Thanks to the continuous efforts of MEET TAIWAN, Taiwan made the largest progress ever by ranking in the top 4 of Asia and 27th for associate meetings in the world in 2014, according to ICCA’s annual report. For an industry highly-integrated with the world, it is crucial to have a long-term and stable partnership with both international MICE organizations and other industry players. MEET TAIWAN takes immediate actions to develop strong partnerships and solid professional knowledge of MICE, making Taiwan a well-known destination in the Asia Pacific region.\nSource:- IccaWorld News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:13:39.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
