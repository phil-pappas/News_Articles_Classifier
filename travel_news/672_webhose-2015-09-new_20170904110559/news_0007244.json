An innovative, new exterior LED lighting product released by energybank designed for automotive merchandising applications reduces energy costs by up to 80% while delivering high-quality illumination. \"This is one of the most exciting new developments I've been involved with,\" stated Neal Verfuerth , energybank founder/CEO. \"Customers can now get the best performance from LED technology and get maximum life expectancy using our patent-pending Forced Vector Cooling™ process combined with our other proprietary thermal management advances.\"\nTwo years of research, development and rigorous testing have allowed energybank to deliver the model T™ exterior fixture featuring world-class components from Osram and Nichia. Unlike anything else on the market, the model T is designed and built in the USA for high functionality, high quality and aesthetic integration. A single, sleek model T fixture per pole, consuming 640 watts, replaces two (2) 1000 watt metal halides to achieve significant energy savings. With proprietary optics that virtually eliminate glare for superior visual comfort and enhanced curb appeal, the fixture is International Dark-Sky Association compliant to reduce light pollution.\nForced Vector Cooling™ is a unique patent-pending feature of the model T. Cool air is drawn up through a thermal chimney, passed over components to keep them cool and exhausted as warm air to maximize component longevity and performance.\nIn addition to exceptional performance, model T is designed for ease of installation. Fast and secure, Pinnacle Mounting™ eliminates the need for extensions, adapters and other apparatus to mount. The resulting sleek form factor has a minimal EPA rating for reduced stress on poles.\nAstroDim scheduling, Turbo Boost controls, custom colors and logos are additional features that make it unlike any other exterior fixture available.\nKolosso Automotive of Appleton installed model T at their car dealership. Ryan Kolosso had the following feedback, \"As good as the lights are, I'm also impressed by how much the costs have been lowered compared to the old lights. 70% less energy is providing a 300% increase in illumination on the car hood. I couldn't be happier with the model T LED fixtures.\"\n\" John and Ryan Kolosso truly understand the effect of superior illumination for their marketing efforts. When you analyze the cost per impression on the potential customers who either drive past or onto their lot, it's easily one of the most effective marketing spends in their budget,\" observed Verfeurth.\nThe model T fixture is included on the DLC Qualified Products List.\nenergybank is a Manitowoc, Wisconsin -based company specializing in the advancement of solid state lighting and controls. energybank has unique capabilities in the lighting and controls industry with its proprietary: thermal management, optical optimization and application engineering. 18 patent applications have been submitted to protect its intellectual property with more pending.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150915/266911\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/model-t-revolutionizes-exterior-led-lighting-300143617.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150915/266911", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=CG02942&Transmission_Id=201509160530PR_NEWS_USPR_____CG02942&DateId=20150916", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/model-t-revolutionizes-exterior-led-lighting-300143617.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150915/266911"], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T13:57:52.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
