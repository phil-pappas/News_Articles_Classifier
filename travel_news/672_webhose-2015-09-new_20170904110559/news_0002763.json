We can move on average 10,000 people per hour through our queuing system but unfortunately for some of the busier queues, this could mean up to a three hour wait.\nHowever there is lots of capacity available and we will work hard to ensure that all our passengers are sent safely on their way by the end of the evening.\nâ€“ Lynne Milligan, Arriva Trains Wales Last updated Mon 21 Sep 2015 Read more 8 updates First Great Western apologises to rugby fans for train delays Travel Rugby world cup 2015 Cardiff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T23:17:09.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
