Two international flights were called back while one preparing for departure was taken to an isolated area following the bomb threat.\nAccording to reports, at around 01:30 hours (IST) on Saturday, a threat call was received at the Delhi’s Airport call center in Gurgaon. The threat call arguably informed that there are bombs on three international flights – 9W078 of Jet Airways to Hong Kong, CX694 of Cathay Pacific also bound for Hong Kong and LX147 of Swiss Air to Zurich. The threat call was later marked as a hoax call, according to the airport authorities.\nBoth the Jet Airways flight and the Cathay Pacific flights were called back under emergency conditions and taken to an isolated area. Swiss Air flight was grounded and was taken to a isolation bay.\nAfter thorough search of the aircraft, passengers and their baggage was carried out by the security agencies and later all the three flights were cleared for take-off.\nThere were 194 passengers on board the Jet Airways flight bound for Hong Kong along with 12 crew members.\nThe delay caused due to the hoax call delayed the flights scheduled to fly from Delhi. Some Air India flights from Delhi were delayed as well. According to the latest reports, the caller has been traced and normal services at the Delhi airport are restored.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T14:02:43.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
