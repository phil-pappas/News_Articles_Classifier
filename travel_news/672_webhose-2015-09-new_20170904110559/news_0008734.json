The two dated for four and a half years before Graham proposed on New Year’s Day in 2014 while they were visiting Santa Barbara on a weekend trip. “I was cranky,” admits Chloe. “So he was nervous and kind of scared of me and just kept it really simple while we were taking a walk in the evening before dinner. He said, ‘I have a question. I think we should get married.’ And my first response was, ‘That’s not a question!’ I know I’m a brat, but I’m an editor—what do you want from me? Then I said, ‘Oh wow, this is happening.’ I don’t think I ever actually said ‘yes,’ there was no need. He brought the ring out of his pocket in a Kleenex—a detail that makes my mother [ Candice Bergen ] shudder and yell, ‘A KLEENEX!’ every time she hears it.”\nChloe never had preconceived grand plans for her big day. “Before we got engaged, and for several months afterward, the idea of a wedding really stressed me out,” she admits. “Where to have it, who to invite, how to make it personal and actually enjoy it. I couldn’t get my mind around it. The only thing I knew I wanted was to wear Valentino white lace espadrilles, but other than that I had nothing!”\nAfter the initial overwhelming days following Graham’s proposal, she realized that the only place she would really feel completely comfortable and happy getting married was Le Coual, her father, Louis Malle’ s house in Southwestern France . “It is a sixteenth-century stone manor house that my father bought almost 50 years ago when it was completely derelict and had last been used during World War II as a Resistance hideout,” she explains. “He restored it beautifully and loved being there more than any place in the world. I grew up spending every summer there and the minute I turn down the driveway my heart leaps—I get so excited, it’s a visceral reaction, I just love being there more than anything. When my father died, he left the house to me and my two half-siblings. They both live in Paris with their families and our time together in Le Coual each summer is sometimes the only time we spend together all year. For the past several summers, Graham has been coming to Le Coual with me, and during his first trip he seamlessly blended into the fabric of the house and its occupants—this was one of the first times I really imagined spending the rest of our lives together. When I suggested we get married in Le Coual, he was thrilled.”\nChloe and Graham both knew that it would have to be small though—“Like really small,” says Chloe. “My mother and father got married there 35 years ago, and they had thirteen guests!” The only way for them to make it work was to have a party in New York with their extended family and friends and treat that like the traditional wedding reception—and then have the event at Le Coual for just a handful of their closest friends and immediate family. “Originally, I thought we’d have a party in New York after the wedding, but my mother was so eager for us to get married immediately that our compromise was to do a big engagement party in New York that felt like a wedding and then get married the following summer in Le Coual. It ended up being the perfect solution because the actual wedding in France was small enough that Graham and I were both able to really enjoy ourselves,” says Chloe.\nThe two visual references Chloe used as inspiration for the wedding were Valentino lace espadrilles and the annual fetes that the local villages all have once a year in their main square, called un bal champêtre . “There are always long picnic tables with strings of round bulb lights overhead,” she explains. “I wanted it to be country chic or ‘paysan chic’ as Graham described the dress code on our website which he made. The goal was for the celebration to feel comfortable and lively and true to the region but sort of a stylized version, thus the Valentino espadrilles!”\nFor Chloe, finding a dress was the easiest part of the process. “I was convinced I wanted a vintage dress, a Victorian lace tea dress—but then in the spring of 2014, soon after I had gotten engaged, I was absently scrolling through photos of Oscar de la Renta ’s 2015 Bridal show and the first look was the prettiest, simplest, loveliest wedding dress I had ever seen,” remembers Chloe. “It was exactly what I wanted for a French country wedding, it looked like the dress Belle from Beauty and the Beast might wear if she ended up marrying Gaston in her village instead of the Beast. I immediately emailed Erika Bearman at Oscar de la Renta and asked her about the dress. It turned out they weren’t producing it, but it had been Oscar’s favorite dress of the show, which of course made my heart melt, and it turned out to be Oscar’s last bridal collection. Thanks to Erika I ended up wearing the sample and having it altered—obviously, I’m vertically challenged—and I couldn’t have been happier.”\nThe shoes were another story. Chloe had already purchased the Valentino espadrilles she’d been eyeing, but when she tried them on with the dress, they competed a bit with the simplicity and crispness of the dress’s broderie anglaise. So, her mother ordered white satin ballet slippers and had them custom dyed to match a periwinkle grosgrain ribbon from M&J Trimming so the ribbon could hold her bouquet and the shoes could serve as her something blue. Then Chloe found a gorgeous pair of antique emerald and diamond dragonfly earrings on 1stdibs that she and her mother fell in love with. “My mom bought them for me as a wedding gift and my ‘something new’—I was thrilled,” she says. “They were the only jewelry I wore for the wedding besides my engagement ring and later my wedding band. The dragonflies were the perfect size and the green of the emeralds was so vibrant it really felt like the perfect touch for a country wedding outdoors.”\nWith the addition of the earrings, it quickly became clear that the blue ballet slippers no longer worked though. Luckily, Chloe’s mother found a pair of fuchsia satin Christian Louboutin espadrilles that were the perfect fun pop of color and worked well with the earrings. “But it was a lot of pop, so the jury was still out!” jokes Chloe.\nTwo weeks before the wedding, Chloe was going through a box in the back of a closet at home and almost eerily came upon the little white leather ballet slippers that her mother wore for her wedding. It was serendipity. “She had had lace appliqués sewn onto the top of the toe box, and they were so pretty and delicate I felt like there was no way I couldn’t wear them,” says Chloe. “There was my something old! I ended up wearing both the Valentino and Christian Louboutin espadrilles throughout the wedding weekend too, and they were a big hit.”\nWhen it came down to planning the nitty-gritty of the wedding weekend, the logistics weren’t simple. The location of Le Coual is very remote. “It is truly La France profonde, as they say, and someone local doing my hair and makeup wasn’t really an option. I also didn’t love the idea of making a huge fuss about that since the other aspects of the wedding were so relaxed and low-key,” she explains. “I asked my friend Suzy Gerstein, who is a wonderful editorial makeup artist, for a tutorial before I left for France, and I studiously practiced all the tips and tricks she showed me and filled my arsenal with the tools I would need. I didn’t want to wear a lot of makeup anyway, so it ended up being the perfect solution. I had a whole pipe dream that my mother and I were going to go to the Braid Bar at John Barrett and get a braiding tutorial and then she could just do my hair for the wedding, but whenever I relayed this brilliant plan to people, they convinced me it was a recipe for disaster. And when I told Vogue.com Beauty Director Catherine Piercy about it, she diplomatically asked, ‘Is your mom particularly good at braiding hair? Or doing hair?’ My response? ‘Hmm. Well, no, she’s not, but it just sounded like a good idea.’ Catherine swiftly put me in touch with a member of Guido Palau’ s team, Andre Cueto Saavedra, in Paris, and the rest was easy. Andre came down on the train Friday night and went back on Saturday right after he finished doing my mom’s and my hair. And boy, was it worth it. I wanted my hair back and braided loosely with some wildflowers nestled in and that’s exactly what I got but so much prettier and more lyrical than I imagined.”\nGyl Crayssac, the mayor of Lugagnac, the local village which has a population of 100 people, married Chloe and Graham in a civil ceremony inside the town hall. “The town hall is one small room that fit about 40 people standing, and it is the same room where my mother and father were married,” says Chloe. “I really wanted to be married in France—I didn’t want it to be a ‘fake wedding.’ The mayor counted Le Coual as my French residence, so we were able to do that, plus a lot of paperwork! My sister and Graham’s sister were our two witnesses, and the four of us signed about 500 French legal documents before the ceremony was over.”\nAfter the civil ceremony, which lasted about 20 minutes, the couple went down the hill to the village square and shared a champagne toast with everyone in the village. “The village is really small, and we know everyone—a wedding is a big event so this was a nice way to include people, and it felt very festive.”\nGuests then either walked or drove the kilometer back to the house for cocktail hour in the front garden. “People were very excited about the local foie gras,” laughs Chloe. “My father loved Django Reinhardt and Stéphane Grappelli, as do I, and so we found a trio that could play their music. It was important to me that there be notes of my father in different parts of the wedding.”\nThe group moved to the other side of the house for dinner, which was in the walled-in garden behind the kitchen where the family usually has all their meals. “I wanted the evening to be a chic version of a bal champêtre, or a country village picnic, so we found these vintage bistro chairs and the plates are actually painted tin by a wonderful place in Paris called Au Bain Marie,” says Chloe. “I probably spent the most time on planning the tables. I looked at different fabrics for the tablecloths for months and finally decided on this lovely Carolina Irving stripe print in grass green and had it made into giant tablecloths. Our florist, Zeste, from nearby Montauban, did a great job working with my directions to make it very lively and natural using wildflowers and vintage vessels and vases. We strung strings of lights with large round bulbs like they always have at the village fetes.”\nThe couple used a local caterer who owns a restaurant in the closest town, Cahors. “We served everything family style and had a variety of local vegetable appetizers and then duck for the main course,” says Chloe. “Dessert is very important to me, and the French don’t really do wedding cakes, so we had a big dessert table instead and served a variety of fruit tarts, chocolate mousse, and clafoutis.”\nChloe’s half-sister; her best friend, Jackie; her uncle; Graham’s best friend, Brett; and the couple’s mutual friend Hussein all gave toasts. And then after dinner, Chloe changed into a short Alberta Ferretti dress for dancing and wore her Valentino lace espadrilles since her mother’s ballet slippers were a size too big. “I saw the dress on the runway last spring and fell in love,” remembers Chloe. “I can’t wait to wear it again.” After dessert, everyone walked across the property to the old barn, which the DJ, James Nanobox, and the couple’s wedding coordinator, Heather Jerue, had turned into a disco. “We didn’t have a first dance, but I really wanted to start the night off with Motown, so I asked the DJ to play Stevie Wonder’ s ‘Signed, Sealed, Delivered I’m Yours’ when we walked in, which felt appropriate! We had a man come and make crepes outside the barn starting at 1:00 a.m.—I had three. And then, we danced until 3:00 a.m. at which point the shuttle bus drivers got cranky and wanted to go home, so we had to round everyone up. It ended up being good to finish on a high note while everyone was still having a great time.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T14:39:01.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
