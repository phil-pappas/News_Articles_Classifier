Almost half of the 1,923 people studied, all of whom were aged between 16 and 24, thought that it was acceptable to track their partners by going through their phones or installing tracking software. This was one of the findings from a national study by VicHealth in Australia , with the aim of finding out attitudes towards violence against women. Although 84% said that tracking a partner by electronic means without their consent was serious, 46% said they thought in some cases it was acceptable. There are now many ways to track people online, with and without their knowledge. The Google Play store has one such app , that is marketed at parents who want to keep track of their children. You can see where they are at all times, when they have turned their phone off, and read all their SMS messages. Other findings showed worrying attitudes towards relationships from young people. Is it ever acceptable to spy on your partner using an app? Percentage Yes 46 No 54 20% of those surveyed thought that women often say \"no\" to sexual activity when they really mean yes, and 18% said that if a woman was raped while affected by drugs or alcohol, she was partly responsible. Snooping is not just a phenomenon in Australia; a study in 2013 on UK adults in relationships showed that 62 per cent of men and 34 per cent of women had looked through a current or ex-partner's phone without their knowledge. However, doing so is risky business - 31% of those surveyed said that they would consider ending the relationship if they found their partner had gone through their phone without their knowledge. telegraphsciencetech Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T12:10:57.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
