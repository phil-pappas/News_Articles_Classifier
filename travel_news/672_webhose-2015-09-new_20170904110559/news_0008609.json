This certainly applies to the firm’s latest deal, Gardman, a leading supplier of wild bird care products and gardening sundries to the independent garden sector. Ben Slatter, partner at Rutland, explains: “The immediate priority with Gardman was to provide financial stability through a significant cash injection into the business. The investment has enabled the company to pay severely overdue suppliers, replenish stock, and start to increase the availability of product to customers who were being badly let down. It is important to hit the ground running after an acquisition to stabilise the business The process of rebuilding the confidence of stakeholders will take time, but the market has been quick to recognise the initial improvements post deal. “With stability achieved, our focus turns to executing the strategy. Through the diligence phase on Gardman we formed a clear view of what was not working in the business and the opportunities that are available to grow both top line and profitability\". \"Having formed the overall strategic direction, we have continued to test it, as well as gaining the buy-in required from key members of the management team.\" \"Once the strategy is set it is essential to be able to clearly communicate this to the whole organisation in a simple, easy-to-understand form. Delivering performance is usually approached through a detailed and wide-ranging 100-day action plan.\" \"This covers short-term tactical actions, key strategic projects and other best-practice initiatives drawing from our experience gained from investing in other businesses.\" \"A private equity transaction is a fantastic catalyst for culture change in a business but there is a small window to ensure this opportunity is not missed and that enough momentum is created around the key projects.\" “We then spend time, as we are now doing with Gardman, involving ourselves in the business to understand it thoroughly and familiarise ourselves with the detail of issues and opportunities as they emerge, ensuring that robust reporting and KPIs are developed.\" \"However, we also encourage regular and open communication with management. Our belief is that we can be more effective and supportive shareholders the closer we are to the businesses in which we invest.\" In particular, we will always balance the resources required for the strategy that is set and the prioritisation of projects.\" “Ultimately we are investors and not managers of businesses, although what distinguishes us in the turnaround market is the operational commitment we bring to each investment we make, the quality of the relationships we build and the long history we have of successfully working alongside management teams.\" \"You can have the right strategy, but success comes from excellent implementation. For that we rely on quality management with passion and energy, which with our support will create a strong, thriving and valuable business.” • Ben Slatter is a partner at Rutland Partners.
