Since August 17th, 2015, the day Air Canada’s quarterly internal black out period ended after the release of its Second Quarter financial results, it has purchased, for cancellation, 3,085,735 Shares at an average Share price of $11.46 for an aggregate consideration of $35.4 million. Air Canada announced the implementation of a normal course issuer bid on May 26th, 2015 to purchase, for cancellation, up to 10 million Shares representing approximately 3.49 per cent of the 286,846,898 Shares outstanding as at May 14th, 2015.\nAir Canada believes that, from time to time, the market price of its Shares may not fully reflect the underlying value of its business and future prospects. In such circumstances, Air Canada may purchase for cancellation outstanding Shares, thereby benefitting all shareholders by increasing the underlying value of the remaining Shares.\n“The markets have been extremely volatile over the last several weeks due to a number of macro-economic factors, yet we continue to be very positive about Air Canada’s future prospects. We continue to see good value for shareholders in purchasing our shares through the normal course issuer bid and continue to believe, as we previously said, that a modest normal course issuer bid is consistent with our capital allocation strategy and shareholder expectations,” said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer of Air Canada.\nAir Canada is Canada’s largest domestic and international airline serving more than 190 destinations on five continents. Canada’s flag carrier is among the 20 largest airlines in the world and in 2014 served more than 38 million customers. Air Canada provides scheduled passenger service directly to 64 Canadian cities, 52 destinations in the United States and 78 cities in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia, the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America and South America. Air Canada is a founding member of Star Alliance, the world’s most comprehensive air transportation network serving 1,321 airports in 193 countries. Air Canada is the only international network carrier in North America to receive a Four-Star ranking according to independent U.K. research firm Skytrax.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:06:53.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
