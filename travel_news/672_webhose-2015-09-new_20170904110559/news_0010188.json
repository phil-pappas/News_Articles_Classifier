This is a serious matter and we’ll do our best to protect people’s health.\n“A cleaner Guanabara will be one of the main legacies of the games. I have no doubts that we will do the sailing competition in Guanabara.”\nLast week, German sailor Erik Heil revealed that he had to undergo an operation on a serious skin infection after competing in the Olympic test regatta at Guanabara.\n“I have never in my life had a leg infection,” he wrote in a Sailing Team Germany blog. “I assume that I got it from the test regatta.”\nHeil blamed wastewater flowing from a nearby hospital.\nSouth Korean windsurfer Wonwoo Cho also had to be hospitalized after falling ill, while reports said that numerous other athletes had also complained of feeling unwell.\nMeanwhile, Nuzman declared that Brazil’s recession would not have an impact on preparations for the Olympics, saying: “Rio is on the way without a problem.”\nHe also expressed hope that Brazil’s football team would bounce back from the humiliation of their 7-1 loss to Germany in last year’s World Cup semi-finals on home soil by taking gold in the men’s football competition.\n“It will be very important to win the gold medal in football,” he said. “Our football needs this.”", "external_links": ["http://www.sailing.org/"], "published": "2015-09-02T03:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T14:43:30.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
