We would like somewhere close as possible to one of the main ghats, with a view overlooking the ganga if possible. I have had a good look online, but can only find places which are quite budget on the river (such as: palace on steps and shiva ganges view) or places which are fairly opulent, but far away from the main ghats. Can anyone reccommend a place which is comfortable, boutique or a little bit of luxury which is close to the main ghats and has a good atmosphere. Out budget can stretch to Â£50 per night, which I know from experience in India can go a very long way! Any recommendations would be much appreciated -thank you in advance! Alexandra.
