More than 100 works from Spain's House of Alba go on display Friday at the Meadows Museum on the Southern Methodist University campus. The exhibit titled \"Treasures from the House of Alba: 500 Years of Art and Collecting\" runs through Jan. 3. Most of the works have never before left Spain. The exhibit features works by artists including Fra Angelico, Francisco Goya and Auguste Renoir. Other works include a 15th century Bible and a logbook from explorer Christopher Columbus. The Meadows Museum is home to one of the largest collections of Spanish art outside of Spain. ---", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T23:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:12:37.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
