They were followed in descending order by the overhead air vent, the lavatory flush button and the seat belt buckle. CDC warns doctors: Keep an eye out for plague \nMedian testing results for the four flights swabbed, reported in colony-forming units (CFUs) per square inch, found 2,155 CFUs on tray tables, 285 CFUs on the overhead air vent buttons, 265 CFUs on lavatory flush buttons and 230 CFUs on seat belt buckles. \n\"Airline staff are under more pressure in recent years to quickly de-board arriving flights and board departing flights to maximize profit for their carriers,\" the study notes, \"…so tray tables are often only cleaned at the end of the day.\" \nIn airports, the microbiologists identified drinking fountain buttons and bathroom stall locks as the dirtiest places, with 1,240 CFUs and 70 CFUs per square inch respectively. ‹ › \nGrossed out yet? \nFor comparison, tests done by the National Science Foundation found that pet food bowls in homes have 306,000 CPUs per square inch, while home toilets have 172 CPUs and cell phones have 27. \nJohn Zautcke, medical director at the Chicago O'Hare medical clinic, which is opening its first seasonal, in-airport flu shot clinic this weekend, said airports and airplanes are not dirtier than homes or other public places. \n\"Airports and airplanes get cleaned, but there are hundreds of thousands of people moving through those spaces every day,\" he said. \nIt is impossible to avoid coming in contact with the germy places on airplanes and in airports but Zautcke says that's no reason to stop traveling. ‹ Avoid getting the bug! Tricks to dodge the flu › \nTo avoid catching a cold or the flu from germs left behind by other travelers, \"use common sense,\" says Zautcke, \"Try not to touch your mouth after touching any of the germy places on planes and in airports. Wash your hands a lot. Bring along hand sanitizer. Use a towel to open the lavatory door and carry a small package of towelettes.\" \nZautcke suggests using a hand sanitizer after buckling or unbuckling your seatbelt on the plane and wiping down the tray table before using it. \nAnd what about the strange looks you may get from a seatmate? \n\"There is no reason to be ashamed or embarrassed,\" said Zautcke, \"The important thing is to try to avoid germs and stay healthy. In fact, it would be polite to offer your seatmate some sanitizer as well.\" SHOW COMMENTS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T00:10:12.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
