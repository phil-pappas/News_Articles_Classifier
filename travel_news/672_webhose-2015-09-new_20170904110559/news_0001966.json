Beer lovers in England looking for a watering hole that offers an authentic British pub experience and the best selection of suds may want to consult the Good Beer Guide 2016, which announced the top 16 pubs in the Britain. \nAmong the winners on the Campaign for Real Ale’s list is One Inn the Wood, a pub in Greater London that has 'shunned' all forms of electronic entertainment in an effort to revive the old-fashioned art of conversation. \nThat means that punters caught pulling out their mobile devices at the expense of real-world, real-life pub conversation have to put their phones in a 'time-out' fine box. Not unlike a swear jar. \nThe pub also serves a carefully selected menu of local ales and ciders tapped on-site from the barrel, as well as locally pressed pear and apple juices. The Rising Sun in Berkhamsted, a canal-side pub, also made the cut for being a fixture in the local community. \nIn addition to its scenic locale – set along the snaking River Bulbourne about an hour’s drive northeast of London – The Rising Sun offers a rotating list of guest beers and a beer menu that features a mix of local and international brews, lagers, porters and stouts. \nThe Rising Sun is also a community gathering spot, hosting beer festivals, quiz nights and a cheese club. \nFor the list, pubs were judged on their atmosphere, decor, welcome, service, value for money, customer mix, and the quality of their beer. \nCAMRA isn’t the only publication to single out the best pubs in Britain. Michelin’s “Eating Out in Pubs Great Britain and Ireland” is set to be published October 27. \nAll 16 winners will be considered for the National Pub of the Year 2015 award, to be announced in February 2016. \nHere are the top pubs in Britain 2015: \nCentral Southern : The Rising Sun East Anglia : White Horse East Midlands : The Old Poets Corner Greater London : One Inn the Wood Greater Manchester : Crown and Kettle Kent : The Yard of Ale Merseyside : Cricketers Arms South West : Sandford Park Ale House Scotland and NI : Stockbridge Tap Surrey : Surrey Oaks", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T14:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T14:51:01.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
