This year, we are excited to engage with buyers and media at a Seoul Hosted Luncheon. At this luncheon, we will be highlighting new incentives from Seoul, especially our special support programs. Through this intimate session, we want to create an event stronger working relationship with our target audience.\" \n\nAlso wooing buyers over lunch is Dubai Business Events, who are convinced to make its sponsorship debut at IT&CMA after successful experiences with TTG Events where the team co-organised destination-led projects such as the Asia Mega Fam for the bureau. \n\nOn the motivation behind their exclusive luncheon for 25 South-east Asia buyers, Karina Lance, Senior Manager, Sales and Convention Services of Dubai Business Events said: \"Dubai city is constantly evolving. Therefore, the Dubai Business Events sponsored luncheon is a platform for us to further develop relationships with our clients, and provide them with new updates on the offerings in the business events field. We look forward to connecting with Asian MICE meeting planners and decision makers during the networking lunch.\" \n\nAlso motivated by prior success with TTG Events, Tourism Promotions Board Philippines has committed to being the event's sole dinner sponsor. \n\nSaid its Chief of Marketing and Promotions, Susan Del Mundo: \"IT&CMA has proven itself as a trade event that delivers results. In fact, the unprecedented success of Philippines' participation in the 2014 show was evident by the 100% satisfaction ratings recorded relative to the quality of the buyers and corporate travel managers that the Philippine co-exhibitors met.\" \n\nDel Mundo continued: \"The sponsored dinner will be our platform to re-intensify our campaign and build a momentum for the Philippine MICE industry. We hope to garner more interest among the high quality meetings and incentive travel organisers to explore Philippines - currently positioned as one of the top Asian countries with emerging economy.\" \n\nIT&CMA 2015 will be held from September 29 to October 1, 2015 at the Bangkok Convention Centre at CentralWorld. \n\nThis year’s edition is expected to bring together more than 2,500 Asia-Pacific and international delegates.
