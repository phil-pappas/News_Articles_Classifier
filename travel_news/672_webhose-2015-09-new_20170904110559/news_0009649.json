The next-generation of the industry-leading Itemiser family of desktop ETD, Itemiser 4DX quickly detects and identifies trace amounts of explosives on skin, clothing, carried items, bags, vehicles and other surfaces. \n\"Building on 15 years of Itemiser systems screening passengers and baggage at the world's busiest aviation hubs, Itemiser 4DX helps airports enhance security and operational capabilities while reducing false alarms,\" said Karen Bomba, president and CEO, Morpho Detection . \"Morpho's field-proven track record of delivering, servicing and supporting ETD systems around the world has created an unmatched, reliable end-to-end solution. We look forward to supporting M.A.G. as they work to meet their growing passenger and security demands.\" \nPowered by a non-radioactive ITMS™ (Ion Trap Mobility Spectrometer) source, Itemiser 4DX eliminates the administrative, regulatory, storage and shipping requirements associated with a radiation-emitting trace detection source. By leveraging long-life consumables and internal calibration, Itemiser 4DX seeks to minimize operational costs for airports and air cargo facilities, law enforcement agencies and government and critical infrastructure installations. \nCurrently approved for passenger and cargo screening by UK Department for Transport (DfT) and throughout European Civil Aviation Conference's (ECAC) 44 member nations, more than 800 Itemiser 4DX ETD have been shipped to airports throughout Europe. More than 23,000 Morpho ETD systems have been supplied to airports, air cargo facilities, law enforcement agencies and secure locations worldwide. \nFor more information on Morpho's detection products, visit www.morphodetection.com . \nAbout Morpho Detection Benefiting from the financial stability that being part of the Safran ( PAR : SAF ) Group provides, Morpho Detection is a leading supplier of explosives, narcotics and CBRNE threat detection systems to government, military, air and ground transportation, first responder, critical infrastructure and other high-risk organizations.
