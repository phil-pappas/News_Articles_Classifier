Countless websites and metadata search engines, he said, put travel planning at consumers’ fingertips, precluding agents from making a living simply by booking hotel and flights.\n“The dynamic way consumers are planning their vacations today, compounded by the emergence of the millennial traveler and the impact of technology, means agents no longer just can be generalists if they expect to survive and thrive,” he said. “Consumers want to know how to experience a destination like a local. Specialization allows travel professionals to focus their efforts and gain intimate knowledge and expertise that will make them invaluable partners to clients looking for authentic experiences.”\nLeaders of the American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA) and Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) took the stage together for the first time in recent memory to kick off the event’s general session and share their vision for the future of the travel agent community, the importance of professional development and the unique needs of millennial agents and travelers.\nSource:-ASTA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T19:14:38.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
