The two day event on November 8th & 9th 2016 will become the only show in the North tailored towards PA’s, Executive Assistants & Office Managers. UKFE Marketing have chosen to co-locate the event with Venue Expo 2016 as it will be a perfect fit for both exhibitors and delegates and only enhance the experience for both parties. \nThis fit was evident at Venue Expo 2015 with the popularity of the brand new PA Hub seminar theatre, where PA’s were able to learn, network and gain expertise from leading industry figures as well as peruse the show floor to meet with potential suppliers for the events they organise. Jon Lawrence, Director at The PA Hub had this to say about Venue Expo 2015, “It was great to be part of this year’s Venue Expo in Liverpool giving us the opportunity to bring PAs to the exhibition, join our networking events to learn and develop at The PA Hub Stage. With a variety of relevant topics, The PA Hub were responsible for running the PA seminar programme where top speakers could deliver high quality related sessions within the show. \"With a fantastic variety of exhibitors, The PA Hub were delighted to bring top PAs to the event from various regions. We are all about collaboration, networking and bringing PAs together to share good practice and develop. \"The show gave further opportunity to introduce the assistants to some of the best venues and suppliers that are relevant to help them in their roles and the quality of the exhibitors was second to none.” Whether it is managing diaries, organising a team building day for the office or booking meetings for the following week, PA’s are the backbone of an organisation and a key decision maker who hold company budgets and play a pivotal role in organising over 95% of events for their organisation according to research. Venue operator Late Night London quizzed personal and executive assistants about events in October 2013. Of the surveyed, 96% were responsible for their company's events with 16% managing budgets in excess of £90,000. The PA Expo aims to the fill the current gap in the market for a show of this profile in the North of England. The PA Expo will bring together industry professionals from both the North and around the UK to take advantage of the right balance of educational streams, networking opportunities and face to face meetings with high profile exhibitors who can assist when it comes to organising their next event. Key Features of the PA Expo will include a Keynote Theatre featuring high profile speakers and celebrity guests from the UK and abroad, a dedicated PA Networking Area which will have an array of open sessions offering networking opportunities and face to face catch ups and a PA Seminar Theatre which will include education, training and tips for attendees. An array of exhibitors tailored to PA’s will also be available from categories such as Health & Wellbeing, Corporate Gifts, Business Travel and Personal Development along with many more. Of course, attendees can also benefit from the high profile exhibitors as part of the co-locate with The Venue Expo such as Venues, Hotels, Destinations, AV & Sound.
