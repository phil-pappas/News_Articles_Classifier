The airport reported on its official Twitter account that two passengers were taken to a hospital for minor injuries. Fire officials said paramedics on the scene were also evaluating some passengers. \nThe Boeing 777-200 was bound for Gatwick airport near London. \nBritish Airways spokeswoman Caroline Titmuss did not answer questions about the incident in an email exchange but said “safety is always our priority”. She said the airline would release more information later. \nReggie Bügmüncher from Philadelphia said she was charging her phone and waiting at a gate for her flight when she heard people saying: “Oh, my God.” She looked out the window and could see “bursts of flames coming out of the middle of the plane.” \n“Everyone ran to the windows and people were standing on their chairs, looking out, holding their breath with their hands over their mouths,” Ms Bügmüncher said. \nThe plane’s emergency slides were deployed a few moments later and passengers quickly got off the plane. She said it was a “bit more orderly” than she would have expected given the dramatic nature of the fire and smoke. \nFirefighters stationed at the airport reached the plane two minutes after getting reports of flames, and within another three minutes everyone inside the plane had escaped. \nAfter firefighters extinguished the flames, emergency vehicles could be seen surrounding the aircraft, which was left a sooty grey from the smoke and fire retardant. \nFederal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor said the plane’s left engine had caught fire and that an investigation was under way. The National Transportation Safety Board was collecting information about the incident, said Eric Weiss, a spokesman for the agency in Washington. \nClark County Deputy Fire Chief Jon Klassen said the cause of the fire was not yet clear. \nOne of the airport’s runways was shut down, but operations continued on the other three runways, officials said. \nLas Vegas’s airport is the ninth-busiest in the US and had nearly 43m passengers last year. The airport has been taking steps to accommodate more international travellers seeking direct flights to Europe and Asia, including adding new gates to accommodate wide-body double-decker jets.
