Travellers are taking to social media rather than using traditional channels to communicate with airlines. Picture: Bianca De Marchi/News Corp Australia Source: News Corp Australia \nEXCLUSIVE \nQANTAS has scored a new accolade from some of the harshest judges around — social media users. \nAn analysis of social media commentary in August found Qantas not only received the most feedback, it also attracted the highest proportion of positive comments. \nJust over 30 per cent of the 50,638 tweets and Facebook posts about Qantas praised the airline, compared with a mere 7.8 per cent of negative comments. BIG thank you to the @qantas staff at Melbourne Airport for finding my lost @fitbit One that fell out of its pocket! #Qantas #Fitbit #relief — Brad Stephenson (@Shuttlecock) September 9, 2015 11 cabin announcements during a 1 hr flight! gotta be some kind of record #qantas QF1888 #enoughalready — Gary Morrison (@GaryGarymo) September 9, 2015 \nIn contrast, the Bali ash cloud debacle helped make Jetstar the most complained about airline, with negative comments outweighing positive remarks. \nOf the 17,675 posts made about Jetstar on social media in August, 16.9 per cent were critical compared with 14.1 per cent that were favourable. \nVirgin Australia also fared badly as a result of the Bali ash disruptions, with 15.1 per cent of all social media commentary deemed “negative”. \nHowever, the airline managed a higher proportion of positive comments than Jetstar, with 23.6 per cent of the 8266 posts considered complimentary. Troublesome .... The Mt Raung eruptions did no favours for Jetstar and Virgin Australia which copped a barrage of social media criticism for an event beyond their control.
