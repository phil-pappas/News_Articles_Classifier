(HT Photo) \nGuddi (name changed), 9, has a golden stuffed bear she calls Jojo and loves more than her Goldilocks Barbie. Jojo is her security blanket, she hides behind his furry face when she speaks. She occasionally peeks out to smile hesitantly, but her smiles don't reach her eyes. \nShe and Jojo spend all their time watching television from her hospital bed at Medanta, Ranchi, where she is undergoing a series of surgeries to recover after being raped on July 3 in Jharkhand's East Singhbhum district. \nShe retains the inquisitiveness of children, briefly abandoning Jojo to learn how to use an iPad camera to take photos of her mum. She says she misses some of her friends, but flares up asked if she misses school. \"But they don't teach anything. Sir and madam sleep in school,\" she says. \nFor a girl who was kidnapped, raped and left bleeding on a riverbank outside her one-roomed home two months ago, she shows surprising resilience. Her psychiatric assessment done on September 1 says she is not depressed or suffering from psychosis, the medical term used to describe severe mental trauma that impairs thought and emotions and makes a person lose contact with external reality. She is motivated to recover and get her life back. \"Psychologically stable,\" concluded her report at the end of the elaborate psychological assessment, the day before she went for surgery. \nGuddi is happier now than she was a week ago, say her parents, who describe her as unhappy, weepy, irritable and defiant in the weeks following the rape. She'd stopped eating after \"the incident,\" they say, and put it down to her battling physical pain from her many physical wounds. \nWhat Guddi was going through, however, is what clinicians describe as the \"acute trauma phase\" after rape. Three stages of rehab All rape victims go through series of reactions -- emotional, physical, and behavioural -- that are bunched together under the umbrella term of Rape Trauma Syndrome. Since each sexual assault is different, each victim reacts differently, depending on the nature of the act, the circumstance, and the type and amount of force used. For example, when the assault is committed by a stranger, the randomness of the attack creates an overwhelming sense of vulnerability, making fear the most difficult emotion to overcome. In assaulter is someone known, the victim may feel guilt and blame herself for poor judgment. Read: Moody, distracted child? Blame it on bedtime smartphone use \nThe first phase is acute reaction, which lasts for a few weeks. The initial shock and disbelief is followed by the primary feeling is fear, humiliation and shame. Victims turn restless, visibly tense and weepy, or may appear clinically controlled and composed. Sleep patterns go haywire, as do eating patterns, all of which Guddi went through for the weeks following the rape. \nWhat she is going through now is the \"underground stage\", where she is attempting to come to terms with her trauma and return to her life by blocking out thoughts of the assault. This stage may last for years. \nFinally, healing occurs with during the \"recovery stage\", when the victim overcomes fear. Post-traumatic stress In Guddi's case, the mental trauma is likely to strike when she hits puberty and is old enough to understand the nature of the violation. Right now, says the psychiatrist treating her, she has just registered the physical battering, but once she is older, she is very likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). \nSurviving PTSD without psychiatric help and prescription sedatives is possible, and the Tamil Nadu government proved this when it helped thousands of child survivors face their nightmares and demons after the Tsunami in 2004. In partnership with UNICEF and Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan, the government used crayons, puppets, dance, song and yoga to help children overcome the terror of the killer waves that wiped their families and home.
