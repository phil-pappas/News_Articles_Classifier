Unlike George Clooney’s character in Up in the Air, he has never become a “million-miler”, but does claim to have racked up 100 flights per year earlier in his career, and once did a back-of-an-envelope calculation to show that he had spent “about two weeks” of a single 12-month period in Heathrow. As a seasoned business traveller , he knows how to make the most of flying alone, and when with clients and partners. Here are his tips to travelling smart. Make your connections Even if it’s something small such as learning a bit of the language or a local greeting, making an effort is part of being professional. Pay enough attention to the destination to be able to make some genuine observations – about the airport, the local architecture, or that old British favourite, the weather. Leave the whingeing at home Complaining can be a British habit. Even if people from African, Asian or Arabic cultures think that their own infrastructure or bureaucracy makes life difficult, they won’t appreciate your bringing attention to the fact. A laughing matter: professionalism should start the moment you leave home Photo: © Stewart Sutton Adapt to local customs sensibly In Mediterranean countries and many developing economies, they have a more flexible attitude to time than in the UK. A 9am meeting might not actually start until 20 or 30 minutes past the hour. But if you’re a Brit, they will expect you to turn up on time – that’s our reputation. If you end up arriving later than your client and your host, you’ll look seriously unprofessional. Even if you have an assistant, check the logistics yourself. And then check them again Assumptions are the mother of all mess-ups, so just because you can get a taxi to or from the airport in Dubai at any time of the day or night, doesn’t mean that the same is true in other cities in Gulf states. It’s a lot more difficult in Qatar, for example. Ask yourself what your hotel says about you The one thing that you can guarantee will come up in small talk is the hotel that you’re staying in. Staying in the equivalent of Claridge’s might make one client think that you’re a serious outfit. Another might think it’s evidence that you’re overcharging. Don’t force the talk If you’re travelling with a client, it’s good manners to say hello and chat in the departure lounge. But try to judge the vibe, and don’t feel as though you have to book seats together, or continue talking once you’re on board. Being on a flight is one of the last bastions of personal time, so they’ll be looking forward to catching up on work or burying themselves in a good book as much as you are. Really, don’t Even if you’re not travelling with a client, the nature of business today means that it’s not unusual for several different parties to be making their way to the same meeting on the same flight. And it’s not unheard of for someone who has been airing their full and frank views about a particular company or person to realise that the person sitting next to them at the meeting was comfortably within earshot, a few seats away. It’s important to remember, when flying for work, that the professionalism should start the moment you leave home, not just when you arrive at your meeting. Get things wrong, and there could be trouble when you do get back to the office. Get them right, though, and you could find yourself doing some of your best work on the way to your appointments, as you enjoy all of the benefits of flying for business. • Find out more about how to receive business travel rewards by visiting British Airways On Business", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T19:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T13:39:40.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
