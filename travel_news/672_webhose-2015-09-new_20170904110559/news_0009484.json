Jew. Jew.\nI’m a Jew.\nI imagine the majority of us here are Jews. We’re Jews.\nAnd friends of Jews.\nWhat is it about the word “Jew”?\nComedian Louis CK observed: “Jew is a funny word, because Jew is the only word that is the polite thing to call a group of people, and the slur for the same group.”\nHe said: “Most groups have a good and a bad word, theirs is the same word, just with a little [sneer] on it and it becomes a terrible thing to call a person! Because you can say, ‘He’s a Jew ’ and it’s fine, but ‘He’s a Jew...’ that’s all it takes.”\nAre you as comfortable saying “I’m a Jew”\nAs you are saying “I’m Jew ish .”\n“I’m of the Jew ish persuasion.”\nWhy are we more comfortable with ourselves if we add an “ish” to the end? How old are you?\nI’m forty ish .\nActually, I’m forty-four.\nWhat religion are you? I’m Jewish.\nActually, I’m a Jew.\nOne of the entries for “Jewish” on Urban Dictionary says: Someone who is kinda like a Jew, but not quite. For example, “Marisa makes matzo ball soup but never goes to temple, she’ s so Jew ish .”\nYes I know, there are other ish ethnicities. English, Irish, Scottish, Polish, Amish...\nI’m toying with language here, just having fun with suffixes – but... perhaps we are more comfortable being Jewish than “a Jew” because when you add ish to the end of your age or your weight or your height, you’ve made a little wiggle room, you might be a little older, a little younger than you say, a little slimmer, a little heftier, a little shorter, a little taller. You’re this, but you’re fluid, you have brown hair but you’re blond ish , in certain lights. If you’re vegetarian ish you can still have a turkey slider now and then. If you’re due to arrive at six ish , you can still be a few minutes late. The ish is forgiving. You can’t be defined, nailed down. You defy categories. The ish perforates the lines. While Jew is so exacting.\nI’m Jew ish . I’m not orthodox. I left the shtetl with the Enlightenment and never looked back. I have universal principles. I reject the biblical concept of a chosen people. I’m uncomfortable with elitism. I value and defend the rights of all people.\nI’m an American, a citizen, a human being, a humanitarian, a student of humanities, who happens to be Jew ish .\nAnd even with an ish at the end, sometimes we worry things are too Jewish...\nNo one walks into a pho restaurant and complains that it’s ‘too Vietnamese,’ a patisserie and says, ‘too French.’ A trattoria and says, ‘oh, too Italian.’ But Jews, we walk into a deli and sometimes it feels too Jewish!\nVanessa Hidary, also known as the Hebrew Mamasita tells this story:\nI meet a guy in a bar that’ s cute. He asks me out to dinner on the following Tuesday. I decline. Next Tuesday is Yom Kippur, I will be fasting. “You’re Jewish. Wow, you don’t look Jewish. You don’t act Jewish.” And he says it in this tone that sounds like he’ s complimenting me. And I say, and I say, nothing. I say nothing which combined with a flirty smile translates as “Thank you.” I say nothing because I got a contact high off of someone’ s anti-Semitic crack pipe... Bartender! Tell me I don’t look Jewish. Tell me I don’ t act Jewish. Because...what does Jewish look like to you? Should I fiddle on a roof for you? Should I humor you with oy veys and refuse to pay because oh, you know how we like to “Jew you down.” Jew you down? I’d like to throw you down, because I walked here long miles on hot sand to publicly repent my sins, because I almost forgot six million died without having the option of giggling on barstools...and if you must see me as that blood-sucking Jew, see me as that pesky mosquito who sucks the prejudice right out of you...Someone tells you you don’ t act like or look like your people? Impossible. Because you are your people. You just tell them they don’t look. Period.\nGood stuff. But there’s a reason “Jew” is uncomfortable at times. A reason we worry about things being too Jewish. A reason we forget that two of the most iconic beauties on the planet, Marilyn Monroe and Liz Taylor, were Jews by choice. A reason why we feel good when we blend in.\nBecause despite living in West Los Angeles, sometimes we think “Jew,” and we still think beard, sidelocks. Shtreiml. Yellow star. German propaganda. Cartoons. Warsaw. Young boy with his hands up. Piles of shoes. We think soap. Lampshade.\nIt’s safer to be Jew ish than a Jew.\nJew has been defined by the centuries, chiseled by abusive hands, molested\ninto shape. A blood-stained word. A target. A word people spit.\nThis past year has seen a rise of anti-Semitism on American campuses2 and around the world.\nStarting with a firebomb thrown at a synagogue shortly before the start of Rosh Hashanah services last year in Kiev.\nA rabbi in Belgium stabbed in the throat walking to synagogue. A Belgium officer ranting online saying, “The word Jew itself is dirty.” Jews assaulted in Austria.\nPosters calling Jews murderers and criminals all over the capital of Brazil. In Denmark, a kosher restaurant smashed, painted with the words “Jewish pig.” A gunman opening fire at the Great Synagogue of Copenhagen.\nIn France, a Jewish woman and her child violently assaulted by others shouting “You’re a dirty race.” People beaten, punched, kicked walking home from synagogue. Windows smashed at the Jewish library. A Jewish boy tear-gassed. Four Jewish men killed in a Kosher supermarket the same time a dozen people were killed at a newspaper. Je suis Charlie. Je suis Juif.\nHundreds of graves in a Jewish French cemetery overturned, the words “dirty Jew” graffitied. Jewish cemeteries vandalized in Greece, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Russia, Norway. Swastikas and slogans like “six million more.”\nA soccer game in Amsterdam where people chanted: “Hamas, Hamas, Jews to the gas” and “My father was in the commandos, my mother in the SS, together they burned Jews because Jews burn the best.” Happened this year.\nAn attack inside a London synagogue. Jewish teens attacked in a South African shopping mall, assailants yelling ‘You Jew.”\nEven though there are strides, Pope Francis saying this year: “It’s a contradiction that a Christian is anti-Semitic. His roots are Jewish. Let anti- Semitism be banished from the heart and life of every man and every woman.” It was a rough, rough year.\nIt is upsetting, scary, but not surprising. It happens whenever the world spirals down. Economic distress. Debt. Recession. Crash. Blame the Jew. The eternal scapegoat reloaded.\nIn fact, that’s what this day was originally about. Torah describes the ancient Temple ritual on Yom Kippur. The High Priest took two goats, sacrificed one on the altar to God, and the other was sent off into the wilderness3. The original scape-goat.\nWe invented the scapegoat. And... we are the scapegoat.\nYes, “Jew” is a tough word.\nThe first time the word “Jew” appears in our Scripture is when our matriarch Leah says of her fourth baby, “This time I shall thank the Lord,” and she names him Yehuda . Judah. Which means “Thankful.” Judaism means thankfulness. Jew means Thankful One.\nThe first time the word “Jew” appears not as a name but an identity in our Scripture is in the Book of Esther. “Mordechai the Jew.” And we all know that story. In chapter 3 it says: “Haman said to King Ahasuerus, ‘There is a certain people scattered and separate among the peoples throughout all the provinces of your kingdom, and their laws differ from [those of] every people, and they do not keep the king’s laws; it is [therefore] of no use for the king to let them be. If it pleases the king, let it be written to destroy them.”\n“A certain people.”\nBoo Haman. Cue the groggers. His genocide is thwarted, and at the end Haman hangs. But he’s not dead.\nYou could hear echoes of Haman when the term “The Jewish Question” was first used in Great Britain in 1750 in debates over the status of the Jew in European society.\nThe question was discussed in France after the French Revolution in 1789.\n“There is a certain people.”\nThe Jewish Question then moved to Germany.\n“There is a certain people, and their laws differ.”\nReform Judaism was born around the French Revolution, when for the first time, European Jews were recognized as citizens of the countries in which they lived. No longer ghettoized, no longer “separate among the peoples” the Reform movement re-formed Jewish practice to mainstream Judaism, pledging allegiance to this new world of opportunity, no longer German Jews but Jewish Germans.\nIn its earliest iteration, our movement removed Hebrew from prayer books, renounced circumcision, kosher laws, family purity laws, renounced the hope for a restored Israel, called Germany the new Zion, replaced Bar Mitzvah with confirmation, changed Shabbat to Sundays.\nThere is a certain people scattered and separate among the peoples and their laws differ.”\nEven so, Haman’s voice persisted.\nThere is a certain people scattered and separate...and they do not “keep the king’s laws.”\nKarl Marx wrote a work called “On The Jewish Question.”\n“There is a certain people.”\nThe Dreyfus affair.\n“There is a certain people.”\nTheodor Herzl’s answer to the Jewish Question was Zionism.\nHitler’s answer was different. A genocide that would not be thwarted. “If it pleases the king, let it be written to destroy them.” Haman’s revenge.\nOh once there was a wicked wicked man\nAnd Haman was his name sir,\nHe would have murdered all the Jews\nThough they were not to blame sir.\nOh today we’ll merry merry be,\nOh today we’ll merry merry be,\nOh today we’ll merry merry be, And...\nJoseph was Pharaoh’s right hand man, his top vizier, and he rescued all of Egypt from crippling famine. And then, in Exodus we read, “A new king rose over Egypt who knew not Joseph. And he said to his people, “The children of Israel have become too numerous, so we must deal harshly with them.”\nHow quickly our accomplishments, our mighty contributions, forgotten.\n“There is a certain people.”\nThe echo of those words even heard at UCLA this year, when the student government questioned the ability of a Jewish nominee to maintain an unbiased view.\n“There is a certain people. They do not keep the king’s law.”\nEconomic distress. Debt. Recession. Crash. One goat to the altar. One goat to the wilderness. Bring out the scapegoat.\n“There is a certain people.”\nThis “certain people...” Religion, race, ethnicity, heritage, nationality? A tribe? What makes one a Jew? Birth mother? Mikveh ? Cultural Jew, Hasidic Jew, Reform Jew. Is Judaism particular, universal? Insider/outsider, settler/wanderer, “the other” or just-like-any-other, self-loathing/self-loving, Diasporic/Zionist, pacifist/activist? Witness.\nI want my name back.\nI want our name back.\nRemember the poem by Edmund Fleg. He wrote it in 1929 in France, but you might know it from the Maxwell House haggadah?\nI am a Jew because in all places where there are tears and suffering the Jew weeps.\nI am a Jew because in every age when the cry of despair is heard the Jew hopes.\nI am a Jew because the message of Israel is the most ancient and the most modern.\nI am a Jew because Israel’s promise is a universal promise.\nI am a Jew because for Israel the world is not finished; men will complete it.\nI am a Jew because for Israel man is not yet fully created; men are creating him.\nI am a Jew because Israel places man and his unity above nations and above Israel itself.\nI am a Jew because above man, image of the divine unity, Israel places the unity which is divine.\nI want my name back.\nI want to decide what my name stands for.\nMy name is “Jew.” My name is smoothed by centuries of storms, polished by the rolling river of time. My name is a diamond, born of friction and pressure, thrust to the surface by fiery lava, precious, multi-faceted. My name is “Jew” and my name is the philosopher’s stone, turning base metals into gold, turning all that is mundane in this world and infusing it with meaning, turning it into the shining substance of the sacred. My name is “Jew” and my name turns the animal of man, his brutality, his beastliness, into beauty and righteousness, elevating him above his dust and his dross. “Jew” is the stamp on the greatest love-letter ever written, from Creator to created, the love-letter in which we are given the Ten Commandments, the ethical guideposts of civilizations, the love-letter that proclaimed that every person is made in the Image of God, b’Tzelem Elohim , that every living vessel, whether broken or whole, is infused worthiness, casting down cast systems, a love-letter that told the story of all humanity descending from one couple, that we are one family, no one superior to another, a love-letter that illustrated the redemption of a slave people into a nation of priests, a people whose babies had been drowned in the river, a people beaten and in rags, restored to dignity, a thread of royal blue tied to the corner of their garments, a reminder of each individual’s inherent nobility.\nDear mankind, Here is Shabbat, the world’ s greatest religious gift, a day upon which the flower and the gardener stand as equals to one another, day of peace, of rest, of family, of vision of a future world. Enjoy. Sincerely, Jews.\nDear mankind, Proclaim liberty throughout all the land and unto all the inhabitants thereof. Love, Jews.\nDear mankind, Love your neighbor as yourself. Sincerely, Jews.\nDear mankind, Welcome the stranger in your midst. Sincerely, Jews.\nDear mankind, Let my people go. Sincerely, Jews.\nDear mankind, Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send those, the homeless, tempest-tost to me. Sincerely, Jews.\nDear mankind, Proclaim liberty throughout all the land and unto all the inhabitants thereof. Love, Jews.\nI want my name back.\nJew means “championing what is arguably the single most revolutionary concept in human civilization, monotheism.” One God. A universal moral code of conduct.\nJew means having partnership with the Divine for the repair of our broken world. Tikkun Olam . Not outsourcing to a higher authority.\nJew means helping the other is my responsibility during my lifetime. Jew means confessing my shortcomings and striving to better myself.\nI want my name back. My name is “Jew.” David Harris writes that the Jew is:\nThe first to challenge the status quo and insist on the right to worship differently than the majority. Pluralism – the bedrock of democratic society.\nHeir and custodian of a civilization that is thousands of years old.\nLiving in perpetual mourning for all that was lost, in the Holocaust, the pogroms, the inquisition, the forced conversions, the exiles, the blood libels, while at the same time, living in everlasting gratitude [the Thankful Ones] for the gift of life [and] the sacred task set before us of igniting that special spark within each of us.\nBarely one-fifth of one percent of the world’s population, How we’ve advanced the frontiers of world civilization, 22 percent of all the world’s Nobel prizes... marveling at the almost unimaginable determination to persevere against all the odds, without ever losing hope for a brighter future.\nRabbi Jonathan Quote: :\nI am a Jew because our ancestors were the first to see that the world is driven by a moral purpose, that reality is not a ceaseless war of the elements, to be worshiped as gods, nor history a battle in which might is right and power is to be appeased.\nThe Judaic tradition shaped the moral civilization of the West, teaching for the first time that human life is sacred, that the individual may never be sacrificed for the mass, and that rich and poor, great and small, are all equal before God.\nI am a Jew because...though at times [we] suffered the deepest poverty, [we] never gave up on [our] commitment to helping the poor, or rescuing Jews from other lands, or fighting for justice for the oppressed.\nI am proud to belong to the people Israel, who name means ‘one who wrestles with God and with man and prevails.’ For though we have loved humanity, we have never stopped wrestling with it, challenging the idols of every age.
