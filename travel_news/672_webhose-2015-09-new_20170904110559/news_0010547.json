Sept. 19-20 @VenetianVegas @PalazzoVegas @ShopGrandCanal @FashionShowLV benefits @OCRF\nAbout Ovarian Cancer Research Fund (OCRF):\nOvarian Cancer Research Fund (OCRF) is the oldest and largest charity in the United States funding ovarian cancer research. Our mission is to fund scientific research that leads to more effective identification, treatment, and ultimately a cure for ovarian cancer, as well as related educational and support initiatives. Each year there will be approximately 22,000 new cases of ovarian cancer in the United States , and nearly 15,500 women will die of the disease. Currently there is no effective means of early detection.\nSince 1998, OCRF has awarded over $65 million to ovarian cancer researchers around the country. OCRF-sponsored investigators are developing innovative strategies for early detection; exploring the genetics that increase risk for ovarian cancer; understanding the underlying molecular biology of the disease; identifying new and better targets for treatment; and deciphering how and why ovarian cancer spreads, and how to stop it. OCRF also supports a national program, Woman to Woman, which in 2015 will be providing support through more than 20 hospitals around the country to women in treatment for any gynecologic cancer, as well as their families, by pairing them with survivor volunteers who offer one-on-one emotional support and mentoring.\nIf you're interested in joining the fight, there are many ways to help. Make a donation, consider hosting one of our indoor spinning events, Ovarian Cycle, in your hometown, or contact us and we can help you create a fundraiser of your own.
