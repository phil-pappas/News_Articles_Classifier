Picture: Caters News Source: Picture Media \nSCARED of heights? Then don’t attempt what this woman did. \nLaeticia Gonnon in France has reached incredible heights, breaking the world record for the longest length walked by a woman on a highline. \nReaching 120 metres between mountains, Gonnon’s brave attempt to beat the previous record of 105 metres was captured by her photographer friend, Pierre Chauffour. \n“It only took more or less 10 minutes. But it took four days of hard work and commitment,” Chauffour said. Never fear, Gonnon was actually harnessed for the walk. No doubt it’s still all kinds of scary though. Picture: Caters News Source: Picture Media \nShe reaches dizzying heights as she makes her way across the line, and the daunting space below her is emphasised in the still images. \n“She walked 1km on the line for the first three days and but never crossed it without falling. \n“The day she attempted the record was definitely long and full of suspense. \n“She was often so close to completing it, but of course the more you do it, the more tired you get and the chances of succeeding decrease. Here she walks barefoot across the valley below. Picture: Caters News Source: Supplied \n“Witnessing my friend complete the record filled me with happiness. She didn’t just do it for the record but she wanted to prove herself as an athlete, as it is not a normal sport. \n“It requires hours of hiking, sleeping in hammocks and you can’t go home every day. There is a lot to deal with to stay in shape - both physically and mentally.” \nThe gruelling training Laetitia went through proved to be well worth it as her incredible balance proved second to none as she walked the line over the beautiful sights. Happy to be on solid ground to celebrate her record. Picture: Caters News Source: Picture Media \nThe beautiful landscape around her makes up for the sheer drop beneath her, showing in fact the real danger she could have been in if she wasn’t harnessed in. \nThe previous record was held by Faith Dickey, an American woman, on high-tech webbing, 105m long a few years ago, but now further heights have been reached by Laetitia on the Line-Spirit branded highline.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T12:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T15:19:16.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
