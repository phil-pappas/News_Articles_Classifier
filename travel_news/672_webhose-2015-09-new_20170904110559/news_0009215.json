Virgin America has the other two.\nAtlanta-based Delta tried to get the United gates, and Southwest offered them to Delta in exchange for some of Delta's valuable takeoff and landing rights at New York's LaGuardia Airport, according to documents. Delta passed.\nNow U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade must decide whether Delta can keep running five flights a day at city-owned Love Field using a gate that Southwest controls. Southwest, which operates 180 daily flights there, says it needs every bit of space it can get, and it wants Delta out as early as this week. Delta also flies to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport eight miles away.\nBut Delta likes Love Field's location near some of the most affluent neighbourhoods in Dallas. The airline's top real estate executive, Holden Shannon, said federal and city guidelines should have barred Southwest from buying gate space. Delta expected to spend about $300,000 per year for each gate, he said â€” $8.4 million through 2028, compared with Southwest's $120 million.\nThe hearing was scheduled to resume Tuesday, with testimony by more Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. executives. Kinkeade predicted that the losing airline will appeal his ruling.\nThe judge also expressed surprise at the $120 million price tag for two gates, especially after learning that used jetliners are much cheaper.\nSo, he asked, \"they could have bought eight or 10 planes for what this gate cost?\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T13:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T00:52:49.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
