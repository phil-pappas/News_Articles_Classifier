Thursday September 24, 2015 Print Article \nSince it’s already a challenge scheduling vacation dates, there should be little or no reason not to enjoy a holiday with pals. ― Today pic SINGAPORE, Sept 24 ― Vacationing with friends should be fun, fulfilling experiences. Well, many travellers I asked made it a point to add qualifiers like “depends who I’m going with” or “see what kind of destination”. I understand that completely — there are some friends with whom you’d never go on vacation, due to a spectrum of reasons, from “she eats too slowly” to “he walks too fast”. (I didn’t make those up, by the way. Pace is definitely a factor.) \nLikewise, destinations and what you do there could completely determine your choice of friends. I have a friend who categorises mates: Beach Buddies, Shopping Sidekicks and Japanophiles. The reason? Having the right company goes a long way in maximising the holiday experience. For example, not everyone fancies waking up at the crack of dawn and queuing up for Sushi Dai at Tsukiji Market. \nBut even after picking the right friends with the right personalities for the right trips, nothing is ever guaranteed. As such, here are eight golden rules, which I’ve gleaned after a decade of vacationing with friends. \nLet the control freaks be control freaks \nThis is key to keeping the peace. You know how it works — there’ll always be one or two persons who feel the need to plan the holiday more than the rest. Leave them to fulfil their lifelong mission to be bespoke travel concierges and try not to get in their way unless you have something valuable to contribute. Trust them to have already done the research. If you disagree with the plans in any way, provide constructive suggestions: Don’t say something like, “Huh, nice or not? I never heard of XYZ Resort”. Instead, say: “XYZ Resort is a little out of our budget. How about the cheaper ABC which has got a good rating on TripAdvisor?” \nSettle money matters early \nBe clear about expectations or at least agree to compromise. For instance, not every meal needs to be at a Michelin-starred restaurant. One method I use with my friends is to set aside a budget for the day for meals and activities (say S$100, around RM307 a day) and put it in a pool. That pool would then determine our choice of eateries and activities. If there’s a high-end restaurant or a more expensive day cruise we want to try, we make reservations for it so there are no surprises there. Surprises are bad as you don’t want to feel cornered into doing something. \nRemember: You’re in it together \nThings can and will go wrong when you’re travelling. You just have to make the best out of it; at least, misery loves company. My friends and I once missed our connecting flight to Luang Prabang because we underestimated the size of Bangkok’s sprawling Suvarnabhumi Airport. We ran from one wing of the airport to another only to see the plane fly off without us. We were tired, annoyed and combustible when one of us squeaked out, “See, it was too close a connection.” \nIt would have been easy to explode then, but it was about choosing not to; even though we had to buy a second ticket and spend an additional two hours stewing at the airport. Eventually, we got over it —with our egos and our friendship intact — by not playing the blame game. \nGive and take a chill pill \nBesides compromising on certain things, such as how much to tip or whether to make your way out to a factory outlet when you could be having dim sum, being understanding and “Zen-ing out” when your friends start getting on your nerves is essential. Give each other space to be who they are. Let her Instagram every dish you guys are eating. Or let him chat non-stop with the driver even though you could really do with some silence. When you’ve reached a point in your friendship where you’re comfortable to travel with one another, what’s another 30 minutes of irritating behaviour? \nBe aware: You could be the irritating one \nWe’re all guilty of being self-centred and self-important. Don’t fall into that trap of thinking your needs are bigger than others’. That means stopping with the pseudo-professional food photography when everyone else is ravenous at dinner. \nTake a little risk but know your limits \nThe good thing about vacationing with friends is doing things you might never, ever do if you’re alone or maybe even with your partner. Say, making a spontaneous decision to row across Lashi Lake in Lijiang instead of just watching the action from afar (yes, that was actually attempted). Just having that encouragement and company is motivation enough. You may not always like it, but you will definitely remember it. And isn’t travel about unforgettable experiences? On the flip side, you should know how far you’re willing to be adventurous. Don’t end up resenting your friends for making you do something you really hate. Tell them straight up: “No elephant rides!” \nBe thankful for one another \nA holiday with friends is a chance to spend time catching up on each other’s lives, to reaffirm friendships and forge new memories together. Since it’s already a challenge scheduling vacation dates and agreeing on a place everyone is happy to visit, there should be little or no reason not to enjoy it. Remember, the ultimate aim of the trip, which will come in as a useful reminder when you need to ... \n… Put up with one another’s s*** \nI don’t just mean that metaphorically. Friends who have had to share rooms with only one loo will know what I’m talking about. ― Today", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T02:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T03:38:16.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
