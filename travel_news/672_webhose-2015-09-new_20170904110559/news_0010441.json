The property was sold to the Trust by Lilli Wilson , whose husband and father-in-law served in the U.S. Army.\nThe tract is surrounded by iconic Antietam landmarks such as the Cornfield and Dunker Church. Thousands of soldiers charged across the triangular parcel during six hours of morning combat on September 17, 1862 .\nThe Civil War Trust is also engaged in fundraising to preserve two other historic properties near the Wilson tract: a 1.2-acre parcel near the North Woods and six acres near the East Woods.\nThe Save Historic Antietam Foundation (SHAF) and the Civil War Trust will handle land restoration. Plans include removing the non-historic fence line and a modern barn, as well as replanting 3.5 acres of the East Woods.\n\"As with all our major preservations projects, we rely on our members and partners like SHAF to see this effort through to a successful conclusion,\" noted Lighthizer. \"Their unwavering commitment to the Trust's mission is something that continues to inspire me.\"\nUltimately, the land will be transferred to the NPS.\n\"These 44 acres at the epicenter of Antietam battlefield will be an incredible addition to the park,\" said Trail. \"Our visitors will gain a much clearer picture of the morning phase of the battle, and, I hope, take away greater reverence for the men who fought here.\"\nThe Civil War Trust, America's premier nonprofit battlefield preservation organization, has preserved 41,000 acres of battlefield land in 21 states to date, including 299 acres at Antietam. www.civilwar.org .\n releases/deputy-secretary-of-the-interior-michael-connor-and-civil-war-trust-celebrate-preservation-successes-at-antietam-300151532.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/deputy-secretary-of-the-interior-michael-connor-and-civil-war-trust-celebrate-preservation-successes-at-antietam-300151532.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC15752&Transmission_Id=201509300950PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC15752&DateId=20150930", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.civilwar.org/"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:27:53.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
