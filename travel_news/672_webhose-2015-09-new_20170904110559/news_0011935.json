It is a tourist destination and a mecca for book lovers, and justifiably so. tTaking up an entire city block, Powell’s City houses more than a million new and used books on four floors with a total of 68,000 square feet. Powell’s, which is open 365 days a year claims that, on average, 3,000 people buy something there every day, be it a book, a T-Shirt, or a coffee in their café. tThere are 122 major subject areas and more than 3,500 subsections. On my visit, I wandered through the recommended fiction, non-fiction, new arrivals, the poetry and the psychology sections. I asked to be shown the rare book room and browsed there for awhile tempted to buy a first edition of Patti Smith’s “Seventh Heaven” ($75) but I restrained myself.tThe store never felt crowded, nor did it ever feel overwhelming. Each section had recommended titles both at the end of the aisles and throughout the shelves with tabs where store employees touted individual titles. I had put together a list of books I wanted to track down, some of which were a bit off the beaten path (Roberto Bollano’s “Night in Chile”; Flann Obrien’s “The Third Policeman”, a volume of poetry by Yusef Komunyakaa).tIt was fun to plunge down the aisles in search; and when I didn’t find what I was looking for, there were plenty of employees around, and several designated information desks where employees were at the ready to help.tWhich is when it hit me: I had forgotten the pleasure of being in a bookstore that had deep stock, where you might find that obscure title mentioned by a favorite author in passing. Having stock is what we’ve lost to the internet (by which I mean Amazon) and its supposedly long tail where no book is ever out-of-print and a copy is only a click and two-day Prime shipping away. For the most part, bookstores have abdicated their real estate and the few that remain do so with a small footprint or, in the case of Barnes and Noble, with a wide range of categories carrying only the top sellers.tYes I own a kindle; and yes I do read books on my various devices – but when I do I find I retain what I read somewhat less. More to the point, to be able to buy a book on the spot, on a whim, a long wished for or hunted for title, is a pleasure that I had forgotten about; and that Powel’s City of Books made fresh again. Powell’s is so well merchandised that it is easy to understand why few people ever leave without a few books under their arms. I bought seven books for myself, and my daughter chose five. A good night for Powell’s but an even better night for us.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T07:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T02:56:57.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
