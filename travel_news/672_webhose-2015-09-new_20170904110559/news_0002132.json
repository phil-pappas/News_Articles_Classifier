Luckily, Jack Whitehall is on hand to offer his expert (not-at-all-questionable) advice. How can I stop my new flatmates from taking my food out of the fridge and eating it? Only keep rotten things in there. And by that I don’t mean the reasonably inoffensive stuff that’s a couple of days past its best-before date. I mean milk that’s developing its own personality, cheese you can smell from a good three streets away, vegetables that resemble alien life forms... They’ll soon get the message. Yes, you might well go hungry for a few weeks, but the moral high ground will be yours. Why is it that my laundry always comes out looking horrible whenever I do it myself? Because no one can do washing properly apart from your mum. Mum knows best. You see, in her infinite wisdom she uses something that’s known as fabric conditioner, which no one under the age of 30 has ever bought for themselves. \"There’s nothing women find more attractive than men who are completely dependent on their mothers.\" My advice? Simply stop trying. Give up washing your own clothes. Just stuff them into a holdall and lug the whole festering lot home next time you spend a weekend with your parents. I’ve found that delegating like this really impresses the ladies – there’s nothing women find more attractive than men who are completely dependent on their mothers. (Especially if said men smell of delightful fabric conditioner.) I’m going to a Nineties-themed club night. What should I wear? A colourful shirt, in homage to Nelson Mandela. He was huge in the Nineties – it really was his decade after, let’s face it, a quiet Eighties. Jack Whitehall stars as JP in Channel 4's sitcom Fresh Meat Photo: ALAMY I really fancy someone I live with. Should I make a move? No. No, no, no. Under absolutely no circumstances. Am I making myself clear? Getting together with one of your housemates on a “casual” basis is the worst mistake you can make. Awkward doesn’t even begin to cover it. \"Getting together with one of your housemates on a “casual” basis is the worst mistake you can make.\" If you do get a bit drunk and something happens, then I’m afraid there’s only one possible course of action that’s open to you. The following morning you’ll need to tiptoe out of their room, pack your bags, leave campus immediately and enrol at another university far, far away. Sorry. My best friend from home, who’s taking some time out, wants to come and sleep on my floor for a few weeks. Is this a good idea? It’s really not ideal, to be honest. No good can come of it. But if you put them to work while they’re staying with you they’ll probably never want to come back. Get them scrubbing the bathroom tiles with a toothbrush (obviously not yours), send them to the corner shop for a litre bottle of Fanta several times a day, hide the remote control so they keep having to get up to change the channel manually – you get the picture. Whatever you do, don’t let them get too comfortable. I once had a friend come and stay who was forced to make a pillow out of old pizza boxes to rest his head on. Not only did he not return, he is also no longer my friend. Mission accomplished. I backpacked around South America during my gap year. Showing my new flatmates hundreds of photos of the Inca Trail will be a great way to bond with them, won’t it? Oh, absolutely. They’ll also love being regaled with your touching stories of teaching orphans to read and how you had an amazing connection with “the locals”. And they’ll be extra specially delighted when you get the bongos you picked up in Cuba on your way home out at a house party and start playing them.(This is, of course, all rubbish. Never mention your gap year again. Please, for the love of God.) @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T14:19:14.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
