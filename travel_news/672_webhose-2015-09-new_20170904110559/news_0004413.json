Here are five coastal communities worth exploring: Duluth, Minn. Located on Lake Superior, at the western end of the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway, Duluth is the farthest-inland freshwater seaport and one of the most significant ports in all of North America. Learn about the region's shipping history at Canal Park as you dine and watch giant lake carriers pass under world-famous Aerial Lift Bridge. Take a harbor cruise, go fishing, sailing, kayaking, shopping or visit a lighthouse. Baltimore, Md. Not long ago, Baltimore was an aging industrial port city, but an extraordinary renaissance turned the Inner Harbor into a family-friendly destination. Visit Fort McHenry, which is operated by the National Park Service and has served as the guardian of Baltimore's harbor since the late 1700s. It was the valiant defense of the star-shaped fort that inspired Francis Scott Key to write \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" Make time for the world-renowned Baltimore Aquarium, visit the Edgar Allan Poe museum, cruise the harbor, take in a ballgame at Camden Yards or enjoy a crab feast. Port Townsend, Wash. On the northeast tip of the Olympic Peninsula and nestled on a bluff at the head of Puget Sound, Port Townsend is one of three National Victorian Seaports (along with Galveston and Cape May). The whole family will enjoy the urban-chic vibe while visiting galleries and shops. Just miles from Olympic National Park, the electricity of a once-bustling seaport lingers in the salt air. Ask about the annual wooden boat festival. Cape May, N.J. A National Historic Landmark city, this charming seaside escape was settled by whalers and fishermen in colonial times. The area, which stretches 20 miles into the sea, has long had a Navy presence in an effort to protect American coastal shipping. Today, visitors enjoy tree-canopied streets, Victorian architecture, boutique shopping and a day at the beach. Families should also consider exploring nature trails; bird, whale and dolphin watching; miniature golf; fishing and biking. Key West, Fla. This colorful, palm-lined community is closer to Cuba than Miami and blends its seafaring history with unique geographic, cultural and literary influences. Kids won't soon forget watching the Sunset Celebration on the Mallory Dock along with fellow tourists and a colorful band of jugglers, mimes and musicians. Steep yourselves in the island's subtropical beauty, stroll past mansions, take the conch train or swim with stingrays. Key West is full of waterfront restaurants, museums, dive shops and clothing stores along the 2-mile waterfront, Harborwalk.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:12:10.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
