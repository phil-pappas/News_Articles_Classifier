It will notably enable the Group to repurchase part of two bonds maturing\nin 2017 (coupon of 2.875%) and in 2019 (coupon of 2.50%), and to lengthen the average\nmaturity of its debt while decreasing its average cost of funding.\nAccorHotels’ long-term senior debt is rated BBB- by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch\nRatings.\nBNP Paribas acted as Global Coordinator for this bond issue. Barclays, BNP Paribas,\nCommerzbank, Mitsubishi UFJ, Santander GBM and Société Générale CIB acted as joint\nlead managers and bookrunners.\nSource:- Accor", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T12:53:53.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
