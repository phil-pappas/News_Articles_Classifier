The new systems will provide a smooth journey to the 18 million passengers that pass through Cancún Airport each year.\nCancún is one of the busiest airports in the Caribbean averaging about 800,000 passengers per month in high season and growing at around 10 per cent annually. As a major holiday destination it experiences significant seasonal peaks in addition to spikes in passenger numbers at weekends. Fast turnaround time and efficient facility usage are paramount. A total of 84 airlines use the airport, with many wide body charters bringing in large crowds. ASUR relies on SITA’s technology to manage the peaks in passenger traffic efficiently, and to optimize the use of space and resources ensuring passengers are moved through the airport quickly.\nAdolfo Castro Rivas, CEO/CFO, ASUR, said: “We face increasing passenger numbers each year and it is vital that we have the most efficient, reliable and future-proofed technology so that we manage that growth. For more than a decade, SITA has worked closely with us to ensure that airlines and passengers have a great experience here. As we grow we are confident that SITA will help us deliver their vision of the airport of the future and ensure that visitors to Cancún enjoy a smart, intelligent and connected airport.”\nDuring a recent renovation program, ASUR upgraded its passenger management platform to SITA AirportConnect Open, which supports common-use passenger processing systems (CUPPS) and common-use self-service (CUSS) kiosks. SITA’s platform allows airlines from around the world to operate easily in Cancún and to share check-in areas, kiosks and boarding areas. In addition, new SITA self-service gates will soon be in operation at security check points. Together SITA’s technology will speed passenger flow and provide a better end-to-end passenger experience.\nAlex Covarrubias, SITA Vice President, Latin America, said: “Cancún Airport continues to innovate as it manages current growth and prepares for the future. SITA is partnering with the airport team to ensure that our integrated systems are supporting the end-to-end passenger experience while ensuring efficient operations. These are exciting times as we work together to ensure that Cancún is a fully ready to embrace its future growth.”\nA major part of this multi-terminal tech deal is SITA’s Airport Management solution which allows the airport to proactively control real-time operations. SITA’s technology fully integrates data across the airport and applies the latest business intelligence to present operational decisions in an easy to manage format. It enables prediction of events, automatic triggering of tasks and real-time intelligence for timely decision-making. With this resources are used best as staff and equipment are managed in real-time.\nSITA’s technology is now in operation at the airport and in total 375 workstations and 80 self-service kiosks are in place. In addition, nine self-service gates are being installed. SITA has also provided the new flight information display system which will keep passengers up to date and fully informed throughout the airport.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:47:56.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
