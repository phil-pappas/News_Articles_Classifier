It's an opportunity to escape to the picture-postcard setting of Sorrento, participate in excursions to Pompeii, Mount Vesuvius, the Island of Capri and the Amalfi Coast. In addition to the writing sessions and tours you'll also learn to make the famed Italian limoncello drink and traditional Neapolitan pizza in a beehive oven.\"\nThe week-long event will be held at Casale Antonetta, overlooking the Gulf of Naples . This 18 th century structure, immersed in lemon trees and olive groves, is only a short distance from the center of Sorrento and nearby beaches. The country house provides stone-walled rooms and dining area, a large grass yard with tables and deckchairs where you can enjoy a breathtaking view of the Naples Bay. Complete details on the holiday lodging can be found at www.casaleantonietta.com .\nMike Sedge is a former American Society of Journalists and Authors director-at-large and owner of The Sedge Group, a publishing company with offices in the USA and Europe . He has written TV documentaries for Discovery Channel, published over 4,000 articles and authored 14 books including Marketing Strategies for Writers , Successful Syndication, The Photojournalist's Guide to Making Money and the novel, Death Watch . Sedge has worked for Family Circle , Newsweek , Robb Report , Travel-Holiday and hundreds of other national and international publications. He has been a foreign correspondent for The Associated Press and such magazines as Armed Forces Journal International , Cardiology World News , Internet.com and Scientific American Discovering Archaeology .\nThe cost for the six day holiday, including writing and marketing sessions, tours, lodging, meals, and local transportation to and from the Naples airport is $2,600 .\n\"We considered including air transportation,\" explained Sedge, \"but realized that some participants may want to extend their stay to, say, Rome , Florence, or some other part of Italy . By allowing participants to coordinate their own travel to and from Naples , they have that option.\"\nEnquiries and additional information can be found at www.thesedgegroup.com/holiday or by emailing Amanda Cerbone at marketing@thesedgegroup.com .\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mike-sedges-italian-holiday-for-writers-300125440.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.thesedgegroup.com/holiday", "http://www.casaleantonietta.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mike-sedges-italian-holiday-for-writers-300125440.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH70695&Transmission_Id=201509090000PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH70695&DateId=20150909"], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T08:22:15.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
