The event will incorporate nine separate international symposia, some of which are established meetings and some are new to the horticultural science world. \nInnovative new events will explore topics such as Beverage Crops, Tropical Plant Genomes, Urban Landscapes in Tropical Cities and Poverty, Hidden Hunger and Horticulture. These will be supported by established meetings such as the X International Symposium on Protected Cultivation in Mild Winter Climates, the IV International Symposium on Guava and Other Myrtaceae and the II International Symposium on Tropical Horticulture. The conference will provide the opportunity for stakeholders to interact across the chain networks to share innovative new research outcomes linked to delivering economic benefits, productivity and profitability across the globe. The rolling hills surrounding Cairns are covered in farmland producing everything from fruit, vegetables, herbs, tea and coffee. Combined with two university campuses and Australian government scientific facilities, the region provides outstanding options for the development of these innovative new research topics whilst offering skill development opportunities for local producers. Professor Rod Drew and Dr Robin Roberts, the Co-Conveners, said, “Hosting the ISTTH in Tropical North Queensland is a specific decision on the part of the organisers... Tropical North Queensland possesses the three drivers for horticulture success: quality products, proximity to target markets and well-developed supply chains. “Sharing knowledge with and between eminent scientists and building capacity with emerging researchers in tropical and temperate horticulture makes Cairns the perfect destination for this exciting international symposia. “Cairns’ proximity to South East Asia and the ability of the convention centre to host the nine symposia were also important considerations.” Ross Steele, General Manager, Cairns Convention Centre said, “We are very proud to play a part in attracting meetings such as the International Symposia on Tropical and Temperate Horticulture. Whilst our region provides the canvas for innovative new research topics, the Symposia also brings significant two way knowledge transfer and academic benefit to the horticultural business sector in Australia.” Latest news", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T15:11:21.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
