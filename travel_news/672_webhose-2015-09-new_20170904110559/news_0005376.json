Share this article Share 94 shares Maybe it was a temporary glitch. It's hard to say, since airport officials have refused to comment to the AP.\nBut a quick check of the history on two of the terminals showed one was either empty or had been cleared, and the other had a record only of a visit to Naenara, the North's official website.\nIt's not surprising that there wouldn't be internet access in the internet rooms, considering the country is almost entirely sealed off. Pictured: the new North Korea airport terminal\nAt first glance, internet at the airport would seem like quite a concession for a country that is almost completely sealed off from the World Wide Web.\nHardly any North Koreans have personal-use computers and most of those with online access can see only the country's domestic version of the Web - an intranet that has only websites that are sanctioned by the government and is for internal use only.\nThe internet itself can be seen only by a small number of elites, IT experts or others with a clear need to use it, but it's always under close supervision.\nHere, Kim Jong Un is given a tour of the shiny new airport, which includes souvenir shops and chocolate fondue fountains\nThe Internet room at the airport, which opened a few months ago, is just part of efforts there to give visitors the sense that North Korea is just like any other modern travel destination.\nArriving passengers see coffee and well-stocked souvenir shops, a DVD stand, information desk and a slickly produced billboard showing a crew of the nation's flag-carrier, Air Koryo, looking sharp in their blue and red uniforms.\nThere are even two chocolate fountains, one for white chocolate and the other for dark.\nAnother nod to international norms can be seen right behind the Internet room, in the smoking room.\nIn something almost never seen in North Korea, where just about every adult male who can afford it - including leader Kim Jong Un - is a smoker, the room has a big sign warning that the habit is hazardous to one's health.\nRead more: North Korea News | Daily Mail Online", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1fI8Yh4", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2015-08-27T23:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:17:23.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
