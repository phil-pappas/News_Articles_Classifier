To save time, Qatar Airways and many other airlines operating from HIA offer passengers online check-in. \nGeneral public who are dropping off or collecting passengers are advised to use the short-term car park which provides complimentary parking for the first 30 minutes and costs QAR5 per hour thereafter. \nPassengers also have the option of parking their vehicles at the airport’s long-term car park which provides customers with 2,540 parking spaces and a regular shuttle service to the main terminal every 15-20 minutes. More information about HIA’s parking facilities can be found on its website. \nOn the occasion of Eid Al Adha, the terminal will be decorated with traditional themed displays which portray Qatar’s pride in its culture and highlight the significance of the occasion. The airport will also be distributing gifts and Arabic delicacies to its passengers and will have activities and photo corners for passengers to enjoy. \n“Hamad International Airport wishes its passengers and the people of Qatar safe travels and Eid Mubarak,” said Badr Mohammed Al Meer, Chief Operating Officer at Hamad International Airport.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T23:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T00:25:02.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
