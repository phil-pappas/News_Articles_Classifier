In April, hundreds of American Airlines flights were grounded because of a problem in the flight dispatch software that pilots have on their iPads. United Airlines has had its share of problems in recent months. In July, a faulty computer router prevented the airline from checking in passengers, grounding its fleet. About 150 United flights were delayed in June because of another computer problem. American is moving to complete one of the trickiest phases of its merger with US Airways. (Casey Norton, a spokesman for the airline, said the problem was not related to the merger integration work.) American has met most of the major operational and technical goals related to its 2013 merger. In April, the airline received its single operating certificate from the F.A.A., meaning all flights now operate under the American call sign, which pilots use to communicate with air traffic controllers. The airlines also merged their frequent-flier programs. But the final step is among the most critical in any airline merger. American must switch over all future reservations and passenger information from the system used by US Airways, called Shares, to the system used by American, called Sabre. The airline wants to avoid what happened to United in 2012, when problems with its reservation systems led to months of delays and cancellations after its merger with Continental Airlines. American has opted for a three-month “drain down” approach rather than a more abrupt overnight changeover. American started moving all reservations into a single passenger system in mid-July, and it expects the switch to be completed on Oct. 17.
