Through the agreement Batelco will provide iPads for Gulf Air’s cabin crew team to maximise their efficiency and support the national carrier’s drive to digitise their operational processes. The crew members will benefit from the use of the latest iPad technology with access to Batelco’s dedicated 4G data network and tailor -made packages for the airline.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Captain Nasser Al Salmi, Gulf Air Chief Operating Officer said, “Equipping Gulf Air’s cabin service managers with iPads on-board Gulf Air’s fleet further streamlines our operational performance and gives our team greater capabilities and efficiencies in handling various passenger preferences while inflight. This helps Gulf Air further elevate the customer service experience on-board our aircraft. Accordingly, we are delighted to partner with Batelco to realise this technological development in our on-board service offering.”\n“Gulf Air is keen to utilize the latest technologies as part of our ongoing paperless drive that, in tandem, further enhances our operations, elevating the customer service experience on-board and helping us better serve our passengers. With these tablets, our frontline passenger-service team are equipped with current information about passenger preferences, helping us offer unique and personalized services,” said Director of Information Technology, Dr Jassim Haji.\nBatelco’s Acting Head of Enterprise Division Donya Al Ansari said: “Batelco values its partners and assures them the availability of tailor-made packages and customised support. We are delighted to support Gulf Air with their digitisation efforts, and plan to extend this support further to benefit the Kingdom of Bahrain.”\nIn August 2014 Gulf Air successfully rolled out its new generation iPad Electronic Flight Bags to all the airline’s pilots in order to facilitate the airline’s flight-critical communications while increasing operational efficiency and eliminating paper-based flight materials. The national carrier’s subsequent roll out of iPads to its cabin service managers will be finalized by the end of the year.\nSource:- Gulf Air", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T12:05:54.091+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
