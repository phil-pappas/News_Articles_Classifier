Ms Huther herself has asked the Board of Trustees to approve this appointment. The aid fund is the product of the voluntary and long-term commitment of Germanwings and Lufthansa following the disaster of flight 4U9525. The funding promised by Germanwings and Lufthansa amounts to an overall total of up to 15 million euros. The Board of Trustees will also consider the aspect of the international equity of compensation payments when allocating funds.\nEdda Huther was previously the President of the Constitutional Court of the German Free State of Bavaria and the Higher Regional Court of Munich. She boasts an excellent reputation as an experienced, competent and independent facilitator. Alongside Huther, a relative of the victims from Germany, Spain and one other country respectively will be members of the Board of Trustees. Representatives from Germanwings and Lufthansa will also be appointed as members.\nOne of the purposes of the aid fund is to provide individual support for relatives and their environments on a long-term basis. In concrete individual cases, children and young people who lost one or both parents in the crash can receive, for example, financial support for their education extending past the compensation stipulated by law that they are already entitled to receive. Suggestions for the use of the money in the fund should come from the victimsâ€™ private spheres.\nPlans are in place for the Board of Trustees for the aid fund to begin its work in October. By establishing the Board of Trustees, Germanwings and Lufthansa are also accepting responsibility for the consequences of the crash of flight 4U9525 on a long-term basis.\nSource: Lufthansa.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T10:41:48.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
