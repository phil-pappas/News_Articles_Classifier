The launch of the Beidou navigation satellite system is facilitating the deployment of road information services and opening up further market opportunities for existing and new connected services providers.\nNew analysis from Frost & Sullivan, The Chinese Automotive Connected Services Market ( https://www.frost.com/p86e ), finds that the number of vehicles fitted with original equipment (OE) telematics stood at 1.3 million units in 2014. Installations are expected to triple, reaching 4.2 million by 2020.\nFor complimentary access to more information on this research, please visit: http://corpcom.frost.com/forms/CHN_PR_JZheng_P86E-18_11Aug15 .\n\"Embedded navigation systems will gain traction in mid- and entry-level vehicles,\" said Frost & Sullivan Automotive and Transportation Research Analyst Chan Ming Lih . \"Offering mainstream Chinese infotainment and an eCommerce service platform along with Beidou integration will fast-track the largescale adoption of automotive connected services in China .\"\nIn this budding market, weak consumer knowledge and experience is inevitable. The deep-rooted presence of the portable navigation devices market limits the demand for connected services. Less-expensive aftermarket solutions too edge out OE-fitted connected services in terms of consumer preference.\nWhile Chinese consumers are more likely to support well-known international brands, local manufacturers are aggressively implementing their own automotive connected services strategies and gradually garnering market share. Strong promotional campaigns by global and domestic vendors looking to cash in on the immense market potential in China will improve customer purchasing decisions.\n\"Security, maintenance alerts, automated driving and over-the-air updates will jump to the top of customer requirements,\" determined Ming Lih . \"Real-time location-based services and diagnostic solutions will form a crucial component in future connected service platforms.\"\nConsistently building innovative technologies and achieving economies of scale through mass production will help global and regional suppliers meet the rising expectations of end users in the Chinese automotive connected services market.\nThe Chinese Automotive Connected Services Market is a Strategic Insight that is part of the Automotive & Transportation ( http://ww2.frost.com/research/industry/automotive-transportation ) Growth Partnership Service program.
