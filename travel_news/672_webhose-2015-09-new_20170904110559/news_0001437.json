If you’d have asked her before now whether she saw a future for herself in banking, she’d have laughed. Now she says: “It’s where I want to be in the long term – I genuinely feel I could really make something of this.” With many years of work under her belt – as a student adviser, a nanny and a care worker – she’d never considered retraining, especially not in retail banking. There is a 64.4% * drop in the employment rate between the ages of 53 and 67 “In my mind, apprenticeships are for people my children’s age,” she says. Quite by chance, she heard about Barclays’ Bolder Apprentices programme, which is open to people aged over 24 and has no cap on age limit, at her local job centre. As the first company in the UK to offer apprenticeship places for this age bracket, Barclays is committed to giving anyone who wants to reskill a chance to do so – no matter their age, experience or social circumstances. While Lucille has no direct banking experience, she knows how to care and communicate. “People said to me: ‘Oh, but you’ve never worked in a bank,’ but that just hasn’t been an issue,” she says. It isn’t just people wanting to reskill who are benefiting from Barclays’ Bolder Apprenticeships programme. Those who have been unemployed for a period of time – perhaps returning to work after parental leave or caring for a relative – can be a hidden talent pool for companies, many of whom expect to face skills shortages in the coming years. Just 14% * of organisations have a strategy to manage their ageing workforce “We must ensure older people’s skills do not go to waste,” says Baroness Altmann, Pensions Minister. “There are many potential advantages [of an older workforce] including a stronger economy, higher living standards, reduced benefit spending and improved national well-being. As we live longer, we need to rethink what ‘old’ looks like – the traditional stereotypes of people over 50 no longer apply. It’s never too late to learn new skills, take on new challenges and live life to the full.” Mike Thompson, the director of Barclays’ apprenticeship programme , says that it’s important that businesses match the demographic of their client base. “Older clients want to speak with people who understand what they’re facing,” he says. “We find mature employees bring valuable life experience. We’d love to see more businesses offering this kind of training.” 47% † of non-retired over-fifties would be interested in taking a training course to improve their skills Just as with younger trainees, apprentices on the Bolder Apprenticeships programme, which Barclays is piloting this year, will train for a year, learning the nuts and bolts of banking. Employees will then have the opportunity to specialise further, if they wish. “Everyone came out of training feeling good about themselves in a way they could really believe in,” says Lucille. “The people at the branch were wonderfully supportive – decent and helpful. Our age didn’t matter. This experience has literally been life-changing – and I don’t say that lightly.” • To find out more, watch this video or visit barclays.co.uk/apprenticeships » YOUR VIEWS The Telegraph asked Barclays apprentices what advice they’d give to others looking to re-enter the workplace Deborah Moorcraft, 43 A Barclays Bolder Apprentice, Liverpool “Whether you’re unemployed for two years or 20 years, it can be challenging to find work and easy to lose confidence. Doing this programme has helped me with my communication skills, CV writing and preparing for interviews – and this has all helped my confidence.” Christine griffin, 26 A Barclays Bolder Apprentice, Liverpool “Never look at something and think you can’t do it. My greatest hurdle has always been believing in myself. But through this programme, I’ve learnt that if you put your mind to it, you can achieve anything.” Brian Buckley, 52 A Barclays Bolder Apprentice, Hammersmith “If you can afford it, take a few courses to improve your prospects (most have concessionary fees). I found it helpful for not only learning skills but also for getting me out of the house every day and meeting people.” INSIDER VIEW Mike Thompson, Director, Barclays apprenticeship programme Barclays has launched the Bolder Apprenticeship programme to demonstrate our commitment to creating career opportunities regardless of age. We want to start a conversation with other businesses to increase collaboration, regardless of sector or industry. Baroness Altmann, Minister for Pensions Having a diverse workforce – including an age-diverse workforce – allows a business to reflect its customer base; to better understand and serve its whole range of clients. I’m delighted that Barclays has recognised this and is actively seeking to recruit people of all ages. Dianah Worman, Diversity adviser, CIPD Organisations that respond appropriately to an ageing workforce will gain an edge. The business case for older workers is strong; research shows their experience enables better customer service, enhanced knowledge retention and can address skills shortages. * Source: Avoiding the demographic crunch: labour supply and the ageing workforce, CIPD, June 2015. † Source: A New Vision for Older Workers: Retain, Retrain, Recruit, Report to Government by Dr Ros Altmann, March 2015 You may also be interested in: • Tips for the perfect job interview • Online learning for absolutely everyone • Why work experience matters • Why body language is important at work", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T20:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T15:49:32.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
