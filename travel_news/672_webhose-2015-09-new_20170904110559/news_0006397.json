Even if it’s just your daily commute, time on the road can really add up. A recent study found that the average British motorist will spend three years and four months driving during a lifetime. During that time, they will sit in traffic for three months, kiss 680 times, row with a partner 2,974 times and tell the kids off a whopping 5,520 times. The average British motorist will spend more than three years driving in a lifetime - it needn't be boring Photo: Getty Put simply, a car journey can spell disaster where happy families are concerned. If your tours are tortured with tiffs, look no further. There are plenty of games to be played on long journeys that will pass the time and maintain peace. From the imaginatively named “Yellow Car” to “Lyrical Linguistics” next time you’re stuck in traffic, you’ll have the time of your life* Lyrical Linguistics Carry on a conversation as normal using only the titles or lyrics from songs. No singing allowed, whoever laughs first is out, last one standing is the winner. Name That Tune Passengers take it in turns to hum a song while others guess, but before the hummer starts, other passengers decide how many notes they want to hear; “I’ll name that tune in four” means you only get the first four notes, whoever wins goes next. 1 to 100 Take it in turns to count from one to 100 but make some rules, every five must be replaced by the word “pomegranate”, every number divisible by seven must be replaced with a chicken sound. You can vary the difficulty based on the ages of passengers. Yellow Car One point is scored for every yellow car spotted, two for a yellow van and three for a truck, at the end of the journey the one with the highest score wins. This one can be played in conjunction with another for double jeopardy. Themed Twenty Questions A regular game of Twenty Questions (where one person thinks of an object or person and the other players have 20 goes at guessing what or who it is) is a go-to pursuit, but when the chooser picks something ridiculously obscure, guessing can be difficult – and boring. From Bond villains to Disney Princesses, a themed version helps to reign it in a bit. But remember only questions which can be answered yes or no can be asked. Even if it's just your daily commute, time on the road can really add up Photo: Getty Accent Adventures Decide on an accent or voice at the start of the journey (for example, Australian, a pirate, French) and keep it going the whole way, even when you fill up for petrol or have to ask for directions. Whoever forgets is out. Harmony 100 The driver starts by saying the number “one” then without deciding whose turn it is next, someone else says “two” if two people say a number at the same time you go back to the beginning. Rock, Paper Scissors Forget the original version, get creative and play Ninja, Bear, Soldier or Lion, Cowboy, Shark. Make sure all players agree on what beats what before you start playing. Hint: it’s best to leave the driver out of this one! Travel Scavenger Hunt Before the journey, make everyone a list of items they have to spot: for kids it could be as simple as cows, Eddie Stobart trucks and pylons. For adults get creative and add roadkill, couples arguing and celebrity lookalikes. Find 100 Each passenger is given 100 of a specific thing to spot, from cows to pubs. The first one to reach their 100 is a winner. *OK, that may be a slight exaggeration. But we can bet the time will pass slightly faster… Spend more time laughing and less time worrying behind the wheel. With the AA on your side, you're covered when the unpredictable happens.
