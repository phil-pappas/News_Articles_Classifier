The Queen: A Lifetime In Service on DVD for free, worth £10.99 - just pay postage*. Produced by the top production team responsible for over 40 major royal documentaries, this DVD chronicles Queen Elizabeth II’s long reign - from the golden promise of the post-war era to the austerity of the early Cold War years, the prosperity of the swinging 60s, the new liberal attitudes of the 70s and the rapid social change in the decades since. The programme covers the Queen's extensive public duties at home and abroad, including advising twelve Prime Ministers, from Churchill to Cameron. As head of state, she has travelled widely across the globe and welcomed monarchs and presidents to Britain, entertaining them with full pomp and pageantry at Windsor or Buckingham Palace. The documentary also visits the personal turbulence in the Queen's own family, but also considers that after the upheaval of the last twenty years, the Queen will end her reign in happier times. Her grandchildren bring a promise of a restored future for the monarchy - William and Kate may well replicate the close, united family unit the Queen knew as a child and so the royal wheel will turn full circle. How to claim See the newspaper on Saturday, September 5, 2015 for details of how to claim the exclusive offer, as well as great savings on more Royal Family documentaries on DVD. *£2.80 postage payable. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T23:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T12:59:56.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
