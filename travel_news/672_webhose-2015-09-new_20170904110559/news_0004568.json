The government hopes the show will reinvigorate the economy and support marine tourism and related businesses, which can pitch to the top end of the market where wealthy cruise ship owners are not afraid to spend big money. \nIt will also promote Thailand as Asean's marina hub, a concept which has the potential to rake in tens of billions of baht of revenue per year, advocates say. \nThe Thailand Yacht Show event was initiated by Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, who is keen on an international yacht event being held in Thailand and hopes to develop Phuket as the superyacht hub of Asia. The premier has asked the Transport Ministry and the Ministry of Tourism and Sports to organise the event. \nMarine tourism services, yacht trading, and rental services for boats ranging from small yachts to large cruisers as well as other luxurious marine lifestyle activities will be offered at the event. \n\"The number of yachts here could jump from the current 1,600-1,800 per year to at least 2,000 next year,\" Mr Chula said. \n\"The key is that tourists we get from the yachts are of high quality, which means southern tourism will get a boost and cash flow will be substantial.\" \nAccording to the department chief, the rental fee for a yacht runs between 300,000–400,000 baht per day, with a docking fee of at least 3,000 baht per day. \nAndy Treadwell, founder and owner of SYE Pte, which organises the Singapore Yacht Show and is one of Thailand's event developers, said Thailand could end up being a key destination for yachts travelling in Asia. \nPhuket's infrastructure can handle large yachts and the province also serves as a key strategic location where yachts from the Mediterranean will come to dock when they journey in Southeast Asia or Asia Pacific, said Mr Treadwell. \nPhuket has five marinas to serve customers. Premchai Karnasuta, the managing director of Italian-Thai Development Plc, which owns port service operator Ao Po Grand Marina Co, said the company is accelerating port development ahead of an anticipated rise in marine transport. \n\"The new work will make sure the port can handle up to 460 yachts and the service will be running by December,\" Mr Premchai said. \nAs it prepares to launch the first Thailand Yacht Show, the city hopes to become a key destination for marine travellers, particularly tourists from Europe who flee the cold weather from October to April every year. \n\"A huge amount of money will come to Thailand,\" said Mr Premchai. \nAccording to him, a yacht which docks in Thailand for four months would spend at least 40 million baht. \"This would help stimulate the economy through tourism,\" he said. \nThe director also said he supports the government's plan to build more deep-sea ports in the South to accommodate tourism, despite local opposition. \nA feasibility study has been carried out in Krabi and Koh Samui, while Ranong and Trang also have potential for development, he said. \n\"Thailand has the potential to serve these travellers. If the government mobilises the deep-sea port projects, travellers will stream into Thailand,\" Mr Premchai said. \"If authorities have a clear policy to support marine tourism, I am convinced investments in marina construction would soar,\" he added. \nGet full Bangkok Post printed newspaper experience on your digital devices with Bangkok Post e-newspaper .
