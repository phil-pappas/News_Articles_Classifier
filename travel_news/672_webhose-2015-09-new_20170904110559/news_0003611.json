The airline is also debuting three brand-new television commercials starring Wilson, that air for the first time during Sunday’s game.\n“Russell Wilson and Alaska Airlines go together like Seattle and ‘hometown airline.’ As Seattle’s quarterback, he’s an inspirational leader for our employees and for Seattle football fans across our route network,” said Joe Sprague, Alaska’s senior vice president of communications and external relations. “We can’t wait to cheer him on this football season and for many years to come.”\nThe new, comical commercials feature real Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air employees, and follow the theme of “Alaska Airlines Company Retreat,” a camp where employees are pushed to greatness and teamwork by Wilson.

Among them are the Russell Wilson Passing Academy, which provides youths an opportunity to attend football camp for a once-in-a-lifetime experience; and Strong Against Cancer, a multi-year initiative dedicated to ending childhood cancer. Most recently, Wilson faced off against actor and comedian Joel McHale in the Alaska Airlines Plane Pull for Strong Against Cancer. The friendly competition netted nearly $190,000 in cash and in-kind contributions from Alaska and Plane Pull attendees.\n“My goal is to build strong, long-term partnerships with really great companies and people,” said Wilson. “Alaska and I have so much in common, and I couldn’t be happier to continue this great relationship with my hometown airline.”\nAlaska will support its CFO both on the field and off. The renewed partnership includes:\nDiscounted travel to Russell’s away games this season.
