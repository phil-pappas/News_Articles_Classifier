Inside a book-lined office, the author brushed away a tear. He had just related a poignant encounter with a pig. The first time he took his children to the Blue Hill Fair a few years ago, he had watched a prize sow suckling its young, eerily convinced he’d seen this before. And then he realized where: E. B. White’s “Charlotte’s Web.” “It was such a strange moment of language, time and reality converging,” Mr. Lethem mused. “If you know where to look in Blue Hill, there’s an undercurrent where time is stopped.” Poised at the cusp of Maine’s Downeast region, the Blue Hill peninsula is a spit of seaboard notable for its rough-hewn splendor. With rolling, moss-felted pinelands set against craggy coasts, boulder-strewn blueberry barrens and clapboard farmhouses flaking into painterly decrepitude, the scenery seems purpose-built to bring out the poet within. It is little wonder, then, that in recent years some of the best and brightest literary minds of the day have bought summer homes here, quietly transforming it into a writers’ enclave.

The pioneering cohort has since expanded to include Michael Chabon, Heidi Julavits, Ben Marcus, Edmund White, John Hodgman, Ayelet Waldman and a cast of critics and visual artists. In season, this tiny, sparsely populated landmass might boast a literary-superstar-to-square-mile ratio unequaled anywhere outside Brooklyn. With stores few and far between and cellphone coverage chronically iffy, well-heeled New York holidaymakers, organic farmers and lobstermen coexist in rustic harmony. Is it Blue Hill’s homespun charm that exerts such a siren song on writers? Or do the calm rhythms of life lived close to nature allow those who summer here, as Flaubert said of orderly routines, “to be violent and original” in their work? Part of its allure may lie in geographical happenstance. With the humpback peaks of Mount Desert Island looming due east, developers (and lobster-crazy tourists) have long overlooked Blue Hill, lending it an air of hermetically preserved, frontier-outpost authenticity. But the appeal is also undeniably social. “The natural rhythm of a writer is to alternate long stretches of solitude with bursts of socializing — with other writers — and Blue Hill is well-stocked,” said Edmund White, summer renter and the presiding doyen of gay American literature. Indeed, at lunchtime, Marlintini’s Bar & Grill often transforms into Downeast Maine’s answer to the Algonquin Hotel, a bygone haunt of Manhattan’s literary elite. In the afternoons, the Blue Hill Library is rife with literati tapping that rarest of extravagances in this part of the world — reliable Wi-Fi — to check email.
