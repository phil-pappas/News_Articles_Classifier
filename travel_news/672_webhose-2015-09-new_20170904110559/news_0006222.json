Gatwick offers a guarantee of service if flights don't operate as planned.\n(Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150918/267917 )\nPreviously, connected flights between the participating airlines would have to be booked separately and included the risk of travellers having to buy new flights if the first was delayed. GatwickConnects joins the tickets into a single booking and removes this risk by protecting the connection for the passengers.\nThe airlines taking part in GatwickConnects are easyJet, WOWair and Norwegian, making up 52% of Gatwick's flight traffic. More airlines are expected to follow.\nThis is the first time an airport has taken the lead to book and safeguard connections, which makes full use of Dohop's unique Self-Connect technology of looking up and displaying cost-saving connecting flights.\n\"GatwickConnects is an excellent example of what Dohop's technology is capable of providing, both to consumers and to airports. We are very happy that London Gatwick chose to use our technology for what is clearly a ground-breaking product in travel.\" - David Gunnarsson , Dohop CEO.\nAbout Dohop\nDohop is a simple travel comparison website where users search for flight prices from a range of airlines and online travel agencies, along with hotels and rental cars worldwide.
