HR. 765 the “Restaurant and Retail Jobs and Growth Act” that would make permanent a 15-year tax depreciation schedule for restaurant improvements and new construction, as well as for leasehold and retail improvements and H.R. 2510 that will permanently extend bonus depreciation and modify it so as to provide additional benefits to restaurants.\n“The National Restaurant Association appreciates the House Ways and Means Committee’s willingness to markup legislation that will benefit the restaurant and foodservice industries nationwide. We thank Congressman Kelly (R-PA) for his leadership on the ‘Restaurant and Retail Jobs and Growth Act’ and Congressman Tiberi (R-OH) for his leadership on H.R. 2510 that will permanently extend bonus depreciation. We urge the House to move forward on both pieces of legislation that are vital to our nation’s restaurant industry.\n“America’s one million restaurant locations play an important role generating an estimated $709 billion back into our economy. Restaurant locations experience heavy wear serving 130 million guests a day. As a result, a permanent 15-year depreciation schedule on restaurant-building improvements and new construction and permanent bonus deprecation will provide restaurateurs with certainty in addition to additional cash flow that helps grow their business and continue to feed the economy.”\nSource:- National Restaruant Associtaion", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:08:17.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
