The signing comes on the heels of the recent reopening of Sheraton Barra Rio de Janeiro Hotel in May and, fitting for the Sheraton brand, will be the first international upper-upscale hotel in Santos in the state of São Paulo. \n“Brazil continues to be a key growth market for us and we’re seeing strong momentum in the region,” said Jorge Giannattasio, Senior Vice President and Chief of Operations, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Latin America. “When the hotel opens in 2017, we will once again be the first international hotel chain to enter an important and emerging city, reinforcing the global power of the Sheraton brand.” \nThe new-build Sheraton Santos Hotel is part of a mixed used development that includes residences, offices and retail space. Located in an upscale residential area and within walking distance to the beach, the hotel is adjacent to Shopping Praiamar, the city’s high-end mall, and will include 213 guestrooms featuring the Sheraton brand’s contemporary design. The property will offer all of the Sheraton brand’s signature amenities, including an ultramodern Sheraton Club Lounge, a lobby bar serving the brand’s latest food and beverage program Paired, a signature restaurant, the Shine Spa for Sheraton™, a pool and state-of-the-art fitness facilities. \nSantos is one of the main cities in the state of São Paulo in the South-East of Brazil, and an important hub for oil and gas companies. It is also the busiest container port in Latin America, and is home to various multinational firms. Sheraton Santos Hotel will cater to the increased demand from international and national business travelers, boasting some of the largest meetings and events space in the city with more than 15,000 square feet of meeting space, including a Grand Ballroom measuring almost 5,000 square feet and various banquet rooms. \n“Brazil, with its sheer size and potential, offers many opportunities for us to expand our brands in both primary and secondary cities,” said Victor Vazquez, Senior Vice President of Acquisitions & Development, Latin America. “The signing of Sheraton Santos is a testament to our strong brand recognition in the country and demand for our brands from guests, customers and development partners.” \nSheraton Santos Hotel will be the 10th Starwood hotel in Brazil, joining Sheraton WTC São Paulo and Sheraton Porto Alegre in the South of the country, Sheraton Barra Rio de Janeiro Hotel, Sheraton Grand Rio Hotel & Resort (the brand’s flagship hotel in Brazil), Sheraton Vitoria Hotel in the state of Espírito Santo, Sheraton Reserva do Paiva Hotel & Convention Center, Sheraton da Bahia Salvador, and two Four Points by Sheraton hotels in the cities of Macae and Curitiba.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T23:40:45.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
