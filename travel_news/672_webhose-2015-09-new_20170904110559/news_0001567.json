Since 2013 Thomas Cook Airlines UK, Thomas Cook Airlines Belgium, Thomas Cook Airlines Scandinavia and Condor Flugdienst continuously grow together to benefit from synergy effects as well as savings. One important area is the harmonization of ground handling processes. The positive result of this specific project will not only be financial savings including fuel savings, but also improve the quality of the important load planning process.\n \nCurrently the load control set-up varies from airline to airline and the majority of load sheets is produced at the local airport. The four phases of the load control process (load planning, load sheet, communication and transmission) will be harmonized with the support of Air Dispatch in order to improve the quality of the load planning.\n \n“Our excellent team work throughout the whole group made this important and successful change possible. Air Dispatch delivers the best operational as well as commercial set-up for our Thomas Cook Group Airlines and we are very happy to have this excellent provider at our side”, explains Christian Schmitt, Director Aircraft & Ground Operations, originator of the centralized load control project.\n“Air Dispatch is proud to have been selected as a business partner for the first leisure airlines group to make the move into the centralized load control environment. We are really looking forward to being able to share our knowledge and passion for load control with the Thomas Cook Group”, says Nick Yeadon, Managing Director of Air Dispatch.\n \nThe Thomas Cook Group Airlines consist of four sun and beach focused leisure airlines: Thomas Cook Airlines UK , Thomas Cook Airlines Belgium, Thomas Cook Airlines Scandinavia and Condor Flugdienst. The airlines carry 16.9m passengers per year, generating revenues of £2.8bn. The combined fleet consists of 90 aircraft and is currently undergoing a fleet renewal program by integrating 25 brand new A321 and by modernizing the cabin interiors of the remaining aircraft of the fleet by mid-2016.\n \nSource:- Thomas Cook Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T18:23:43.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
