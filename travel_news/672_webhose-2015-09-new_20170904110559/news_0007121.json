The Tico Times had exclusive access to the inaugural mission of Costa Rica’s new fully armored crime-fighting vehicle, nicknamed “The Protector.” (It was originally called “ The Beast ” but law enforcement authorities changed the name at magistrates’ request.) \nA 22-member team of the Judicial Investigation Police’s Special Tactical Response Unit (SERT) recently set out in The Protector in search of two homicide suspects thought to be hiding out in dangerous areas where gunfights are common and some criminals tote deadly weapons. \nSERT is recognized as one of the best and best-prepared police forces in Latin America. \nHere’s what The Protector’s first mission in Costa Rica looked like: \nThe OIJ tactical team heads out on its first mission, a raid in a dangerous neighborhood of San José known as León XIII. Álvaro Sánchez and Iván Meza/The Tico Times \nThe Protector can carry 16 people and is resistant to shots from AK-47s and other powerful weapons. The vehicle cost $180,000, according to authorities. Álvaro Sánchez and Iván Meza/The Tico Times \nThe OIJ’s tactical unit has carried out 1,450 raids in the last five years. Álvaro Sánchez and Iván Meza/The Tico Times \nThe Special Tactical Response Unit (SERT) enters a home to detain a homicide suspect. Álvaro Sánchez and Iván Meza/The Tico Times \nMembers of the SERT team are highly trained. The U.S. Army and FBI provide some of the training. Álvaro Sánchez and Iván Meza/The Tico Times \nThe Protector provides a high level of security for the agents. Álvaro Sánchez and Iván Meza/The Tico Times \nThis hole allows agents to shoot from inside The Protector in case of an ambush. Álvaro Sánchez and Iván Meza/The Tico Times \nThe SERT team’s one female member waits for the signal to act. Álvaro Sánchez and Iván Meza/The Tico Times \nThe Protector’s high tech communications system allows for fluid communication during missions. Álvaro Sánchez and Iván Meza/The Tico Times \nSERT members get out of The Protector at the site of the group’s second raid in Santa Bárbara de Heredia. Álvaro Sánchez and Iván Meza/The Tico Times \nSERT members prepare to enter home in Santa Bárbara de Heredia. Álvaro Sánchez and Iván Meza/The Tico Times \nSERT members enter a home in Heredia where they detain a homicide suspect. Álvaro Sánchez and Iván Meza/The Tico Times \nThe SERT team finishes its first two missions with The Protector and heads back to headquarters.
