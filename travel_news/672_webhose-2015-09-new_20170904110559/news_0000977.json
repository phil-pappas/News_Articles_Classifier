The name has added significance as it pays homage to the astronauts from the 1965 Apollo 17 mission to the moon who came to Marigot Bay to relax and recover from their mission.\nThe three partners have access to some of the finest and freshest cocoa nibs in the world, which presented a unique opportunity to create a craft brew. Capella’s Moon Bay Chocolate Stout, which is modeled from a classic Irish-style dry stout, incorporates a great proportion of freshly roasted, local St. Lucian cocoa nibs in the process. This complex ale uses six different barley malts and balances fresh hops for bittering and natural preservative to create a smooth and flavorful chocolate stout. The stout has a deep brown appearance and a long lasting foam cap that gives way to chocolate and roasted malt aromas. Upon tasting, there is chocolate on the palate with a slightly hoppy finish and a lingering chocolate aftertaste.\n“To my knowledge, we are making history as this is the first collaboration between a brewery and an ultra-luxury destination resort in the West Indies and beyond,” states Antillia’s CEO Andrew Hashey. Antillia, one of the only artisanal breweries in the Caribbean, typically brews traditional ales and stouts with a wide range of natural agricultural products. However, this is the first time they are using cocoa nibs to brew a beverage in order to help focus attention on Saint Lucia’s culture and heritage.\n“Antillia has created a world class beer for our resort and Capella Marina. This is a beer that puts us on the map for beer tourism. More importantly it adds another special and unique experience that only our guests can enjoy,” states Capella Food and Beverage Manager Glenn Sorensen.\nThe Capella Moon Bay Chocolate Stout will only be available in bottles ($16 USD/liter bottle) and on tap at the resort and marina as well as at the Antillia Brewery Taproom in Rodney Bay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T08:20:53.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
