Picture: BLOOMBERG/SIMON DAWSON Related articles Job losses mount as economy stumbles Commodity exporters yet to feel effects of lower prices, IMF report shows ECONOMIC WEEK AHEAD: Vicious circle of job losses and low growth THE economy is sick, yet according to the country’s politicians, it is not all doom and gloom — and it is not their fault.\nBig plans and bold policy ideas are bandied about, but the data that has come out over the past two quarters reinforce the \"doom and gloom\" view.\nBy all accounts SA’s growth outlook is dire and may have to be revised downwards from the ambitious 5% to a more realistic figure that speaks to present local and global economic conditions.\nUnemployment hovers at the 25% mark, and the low-growth environment does not bode well for SA’s ability to generate jobs.\nMore retrenchments are likely to arise from the dire state of affairs as companies and businesses streamline to stay afloat amid tough operating conditions.\nThe mainstays of the economy — mining, manufacturing and agriculture — dragged it down in the second quarter as a result of falling output.\nScratch beneath the surface, however, and a mixed narrative emerges. Growth prospects for the third quarter are shaky at best and a technical recession remains a possibility, but manufacturing may provide a boost to the economy that could shift perspectives.\nA relatively uneventful year on the strike front, combined with a stabilising electricity supply, have been a boon to the sector.\nBut household spending remains weak and business confidence in the doldrums.\nHousehold spending has reached levels last seen in 2009, when SA was in recession.\nIn addition, the fragile rand will wipe away any benefits flowing from lower oil prices. Its continued weakness may also fuel a petrol price rise.\nCentral bankers will have their eyes fixed on the local currency’s movements as its slide coincides with rising inflation.\nFirst National Bank economists Alex Smith and Mamello Matikinca said the rand’s outlook remained uncertain as global factors — including US interest rates prospects and the Chinese economy’s performance — weighed on the exchange rate.\nThey did not rule out the risk of it losing more value in the short term once the US entered a cycle of interest rate hikes, they said.\nThere is not much the powers that be can do about global factors, but much could be done to mitigate matters on the local front.\nIf the five-month platinum strike had not dragged on, the impending job cuts in the sector may have been prevented.\nIt also beggars belief that SA has introduced a stringent tourist visa regime, despite intense lobbying against it, at a time when other countries are clamouring to ease travel for prospective visitors.\nStatistics SA data show that the country is taking a beating as a result of the visa regime, as more tourists turn their backs on SA in favour of other destinations.\nThe Reserve Bank has estimated that the level of gross travel receipts, from which SA derives significant financial benefit, had dropped nearly 9% in the second quarter.\nBut Barclays Africa economist Peter Worthington said in a research note that he expected SA to experience moderate growth in the third and fourth quarters.\nHowever, lower commodity prices would remain a problem for the mining sector, as well as weak household consumption growth, Mr Worthington said.\nThe gold and coal sector talks are under way, and will be closely watched as the prospect of a strike would send chills through an economy that can ill afford it.\nThe economy is indeed sick, but it is not in intensive care and the prognosis could be worse were it not for the few pockets that are performing relatively well and are preventing a slide into the abyss.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T13:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T12:02:06.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
