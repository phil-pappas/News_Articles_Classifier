The released study examined all rates Quote: d between January 1 and August 31, and thus it shows the accurate overview rather than the last-minute attempt to sell the rest of the hotel rooms.\nThe biggest increases of all have been in Cardiff for the Quarter Final fixture on October 17. While the average price of a room in the Welsh capital was £85 last year, this soared to an eye-watering £1,018 for that date – which, ironically, will not even feature Wales. Rates in Cardiff have been similarly expensive for October 11, when France clash with Ireland in the city (£927 on average), on October 2, when New Zealand meet Georgia (£508) and October 1, when Wales play Fiji (£428).\nThis increase of hotel price in Cardiff is most extreme than ever reported for an event in the UK as Denise Bartlett from Trivago said. “The average in Cardiff for all match nights is £574, which is 140 per cent more expensive than a night in London during the Rugby World Cup.”\nThere are huge rises in hotel prices of London too. The average rates are up by between 9 and 103 per cent. Unsurprisingly, the costliest nights have been on October 31, when the World Cup Final takes place and the average price is £334 for the hotel rooms. For England’s fixture with Australia on October 3, the price is about £332.\nVisitors to Brighton on September 19, when Russia play Japan – hardly the biggest tie of the tournament – have been asked to fork out £376 a night on average, 251 per cent more than usual.\nWhile prices have been high, there are still plenty of rooms up for grabs in most locations, with hotel availability rated above 30 per cent for 25 of the fixtures.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:25:52.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
