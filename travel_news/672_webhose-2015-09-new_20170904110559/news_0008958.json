He found a worthy colleague in chef Brad Briske, an advocate for local farmers and whole-animal cookery. \nAt 49-seat La Balena, the star of the dinner menu is always the whole local fish. Also popular are the osso bucco ($27), where the veal shank is braised with orange and olive, or one of five pastas including pappardelle with wild boar pancetta ($21). \nYou’d be hard-pressed to find a better ribollita ($10) — a bread soup with white beans, kale and a dusting of Parmesan — outside of Florence. The simple butter lettuce salad ($10) with Chianti vinaigrette and Pecorino Sardo proves that the meticulous sourcing pays off. \nLa Balena feels much like a Tuscan trattoria, but when you eat outside at the umbrella-shaded tables, the Carmel vibe really comes into focus. \nThis summer, the Bartolinis opened Il Grillo and doubled the number of people who can enjoy their food. \n“Our No. 1 reason for opening it was that Brad (Briske) needed more kitchen space,” said Anna. The kitchen at La Balena is small, and they insist on doing as much in-house as they can. Now the pastas can be made at the new place, which can also be used for private events. \nIl Grillo’s menu is similar but more stripped-down and casual, and the restaurant doesn’t take reservations. One of the specialties is charcuterie, displayed inside the case that separates the kitchen from the modest dining room that seats 24; there are an additional 23 seats outside. \nPasta ($18) makes up the bulk of the menu. Diners can choose one of a half dozen, such as gnocchi, tagliatelle, strozzapreti or potato ravioli, and one of seven or so sauces that might include beef and pork Bolognese, Chianti braised lamb, clams and white wine, or wild boar and pancetta sugo. \nI chose pappardelle, which had the texture of fine silk. It was draped over and around fine chunks of rabbit that came from a nearby farm. Briske’s ricotta gnocchi has a pillowy texture and went exceptionally well with sausage in an Early Girl tomato sauce. \nThe menu includes a separate section for carpaccio ($15). Selections include thin slices of beef tenderloin with arugula, Parmesan and truffle; or octopus with watermelon, mint and chile oil. \nAs they settle into the new space, Briske is beginning to add a few more items — for example, the whole fish ($28) is now available at Il Grillo as well as La Balena. We also ordered pork Milanese ($28) with nectarine mostarda and yogurt fennel cream. \nIl Grillo was designed to have a more formatted menu and allow people to have a more casual, quick dinner, but that hasn’t been the case so far. \n“People stay even longer than they do at La Balena,” said Anna Bartolini. “I think they just feel comfortable.” \nBetween the two restaurants, they are able to be open for lunch and dinner daily. At either place you’re likely to see the owners, who are as passionate as ever about Italian food, local products and small-town hospitality. \nMichael Bauer is The San Francisco Chronicle’s restaurant critic and editor at large.
