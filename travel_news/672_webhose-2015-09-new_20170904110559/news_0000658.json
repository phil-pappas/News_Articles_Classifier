Visitors stayed more than 2 million nights and spent £123 million.\nThe Tour of Britain arrives in Scotland on Tuesday, 8 September when Stage Two enters Dumfries and Galloway before it finishes at Floors Castle, Kelso in the Scottish Borders. The following day Stage Three starts at Holyrood Park in Edinburgh – the first visit by a national tour to the Scottish capital since May 1999– before heading out through East Lothian and the Borders to Blyth, Northumberland.\nThe Tour of Britain last came to Scotland in 2013 when 21,000 spectators lined the Peebles to Drumlanrig Castle stage generating £427,404 for the local economy in Peebles and £334,404 in Dumfries. A survey conducted after the event found that 70% of spectators were ‘inspired to cycle more regularly’ as a result of their attendance.\nMike Cantlay, Chairman of VisitScotland said:\n“The Aviva Tour of Britain is a high profile, prestigious event and I hope the accompanying footage will inspire even more visitors to get on their bike saddles and explore the breathtaking landscapes of Scotland either by road, mountain, path or trail.\n“Our country is already world-renowned for being one of the best destinations for mountain biking. With the Tour of Britain and the launch of the North Coast 500, given prominence by record-breaking cyclist Mark Beaumont’s epic non-stop ride, the country can boast that its incredible journeys on two wheels are not limited to the off-road tracks and trails.\n“With continued popularity in cycling tourism there is a huge opportunity for the Scottish and local economies. From cycling tours around the incredible Highlands to mountain biking in the Scottish Borders and Dumfries & Galloway, hotels, restaurants and accommodation providers are amongst those businesses which can capitalise from this year-long leisure pursuit.”\nSource:-Visit Scotland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T20:26:19.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
