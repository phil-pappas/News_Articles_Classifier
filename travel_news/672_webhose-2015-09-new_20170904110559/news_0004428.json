In addition, the company is launching immediate availability of a new custom charter pricing model called FlexBase. \nThe Falcon 2000EX features a newly refurbished interior with pearl leather and forward and aft four-place club seating. The cabin configuration allows up to eight passengers to fly in ultimate comfort in one of the most spacious and quiet interiors in its class. \nThe Falcon 2000LX welcomes up to eight passengers, configured with a forward four-place club seating arrangement and aft four-place conference table. In addition to the 20” bulkhead monitor and cabin environmental control system, four individual 8.4” LCD monitors are located within the cabin. \nThe second Falcon 2000LX seats up to ten passengers with the addition of two seats opposite the four-place, berthing conference group. Passengers can enjoy the rich, inviting interior, which includes cream leather seating, veneer satin finish woodwork, and custom metal-plated hardware. \nJoining the company’s growing fleet of Falcon Jets available for charter, these elegantly appointed aircraft are a part of the new FlexBase pricing program. FlexBase features a series of seven base locations around the country and reduces or, in many cases, completely eliminates repositioning costs. With flexible base locations in popular markets, including Los Angeles, New York, Oakland, Miami, Chicago, Dallas, and Denver, clients will experience the benefit of reduced pricing without the need to wait for empty repositioning flights or compromising their standards for luxury travel. \n“Our clients demand the highest operational standards on the most advanced products in the air today,” stated Bill Papariella, chief executive officer of Jet Edge International. “The introduction of FlexBase brings the most desirable airframes, latest amenities, and customized services that our clients desire, where and when they need them. It’s the perfect marriage of both luxury and value.” \nDavid Erich, president of Jet Edge International, added, “Both aircraft owners and charter customers benefit from Jet Edge’s scale and geographic breadth. This new program expands our reach into new markets, while offering even greater benefits for our existing customers.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T23:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T23:03:56.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
