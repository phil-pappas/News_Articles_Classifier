The festival, famous for its exciting live music, food and vendors, is a fundraiser for the Abbot Kinney Festival Association, a 501(c)(3), grant making organization, that supports community-based organizations in Venice with an emphasis on youth, community, and the arts.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150925/270898\nThe Association is proud to have supported such community organizations as A Window Between Worlds, Coding is Cool, the reDiscover Center of Venice and many more. Proceeds from the renting of vendor booths, the popular KidsQuad and the beer gardens are directly reinvested in the community through the grant making program.\nI think a lot of people come to the festival because it's such a great time–amazing music, food, and kids activities–but the festival is so much more than that. We are a fundraiser for the Association, which provides grants to local community organizations,\" says Donna Humphrey , Chair of the Abbot Kinney Festival Association.\n\"The support from the Abbot Kinney Festival Association came at just the right time for us. We operate on a shoestring budget and this grant will provide us the ability to expand our reach to visitors and locals alike. This would not have been possible without the generous support of the Abbot Kinney Festival Association,\" says Tim Rudnick , Venice Oceanarium, Abbot Kinney Festival Association Community Grant Recipient.\nThis year's festival is being held September 27th from 10-6 on iconic Abbot Kinney Boulevard. The lineup includes the Venice Symphony, House of Vibe featuring Chali 2na, and Back of the Hand All-Stars among many others.
