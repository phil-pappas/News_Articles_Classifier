The site was occupied by the Te Wai ō Hua tribe in the early 1700s, although by the time Europeans settled in the region in the late 1800s, its fertile volcanic soils had been converted to pasture land.\nToday Cornwall Park’s open green spaces, peaceful avenues of century-old trees, and rural country atmosphere provide a natural sanctuary for relaxation and recreation.\nThe park is a popular spot for visitors to the region, who flock to Maungakiekie’s 182-metre summit to take in the incredible view across Auckland.\nThis spring, as the park bursts into colour and life, why not pack a picnic and take the opportunity to enjoy the spectacular displays of daffodils and blooming cherry blossom trees that herald the new season. You may even be lucky enough to spot new-born lambs and calves playing in the paddocks nearby.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T02:39:04.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
