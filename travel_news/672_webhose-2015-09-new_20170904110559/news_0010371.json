And Carnival Cruise Line will provide its guests with a variety of opportunities to visit the island paradise in 2016 with 10 departures that feature at least one overnight docked alongside at historic King’s Wharf.\nFrom April through November 2016, guests can embark on five different Carnival ships departing from six convenient U.S. homeports offering itineraries ranging from five to eight days — making 2016 one of the cruise line’s most robust Bermuda programs ever.\nCarnival’s 2016 Bermuda schedule includes:\nCarnival Pride: five-day cruises from Baltimore departing April 10 and Oct. 26 as well as seven-day voyages departing Sept. 4 and 18. Carnival Victory: an eight-day sailing from Port Canaveral departing May 19. Carnival Ecstasy: seven-day cruises from Charleston departing May 12 and Nov. 5. Carnival Splendor: nine-day cruise from Miami departing May 26 Carnival Sunshine: a seven-day cruise from New York departing Oct. 1 and a five-day sailing from Norfolk departing Oct. 23.\nFive-day itineraries feature an overnight call at Bermuda; seven-day cruises spend two nights docked at King’s Wharf; and the eight-day voyage features three nights on the island.\n“By offering Bermuda cruises from a variety of convenient drive-to homeports, we’re providing guests even more opportunities to experience and explore this incredible island paradise,” said Christine Duffy, Carnival’s president. “The island has tremendous tourist appeal and the wide range of cruises offer consumers maximum choice when planning their Bermuda vacation while providing travel agents with a sought-after destination to market to their clients,” she added.\nWhile Bermuda might be best known for its unique pink sand beaches, pastel architecture and famous shorts, it’s also an island with an abundance of activities that enable guests to become immersed in its tropical ambiance and laid-back lifestyle. From world-class golf courses and beautiful beaches to UNESCO World Heritage Sites and underwater explorations by glass-bottom boat, snorkel or scuba, the longer calls make it possible to participate in a variety of activities throughout the day and into the evening. With overnight visits, guests are also able to experience the island’s local nightlife and dine ashore if they choose.\nSource:- Carnival Cruise", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T10:56:47.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
