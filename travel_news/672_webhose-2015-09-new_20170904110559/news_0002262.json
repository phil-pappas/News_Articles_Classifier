But the Brave Blossoms shock defeat over two-time winners South Africa saw demand for team merchandise rocket, forcing one store to close its doors, according to the World Rugby chief executive. Photo: 2015 Getty Images Brett Gosper claimed the pop-up unit on London’s Oxford Street was temporarily unable to cope with the influx of Japanese customers wanting to show their support for the national squad. Mr Gosper tweeted: “We had to close #RWC2015 official merchandise store on Oxford St yesterday due to overwhelming merchandise demand from the Japanese public.” Japan triumphed over the Springboks 34-32 on Saturday , marking the team’s second ever victory at a World Cup and their first in 24 years. Fuelled by a large number of Japanese tourists in the capital, the national team’s merchandise, including beanies, key rings, and replica jerseys, soared in popularity after the match. The range of six items listed on the Rugby World Cup shop website is small in comparison to the array of goods available for England fans, including socks, memento rugby balls and baseball caps. The increase in sales is further good news for the Japanese rugby team, as a cut of sales goes back to each individual nation. We had to close #RWC2015 official merchandise store on Oxford St yesterday due to overwhelming merchandise demand from the Japanese public. — Brett Gosper (@brettgosper) September 21, 2015 A spokesperson for the Rugby World Cup confirmed that the store ran out of Japanese stock on Sunday and huge queues formed outside the store. “Rugby fever has certainly gripped the nation and it appears that everyone wants to be a Japan fan at the moment,” the spokesman said. Eddie Jones, coach of the Japanese team said he could hardly believe the result: “I had to look at the scoreboard at the end just to see if it was true or not”. The Japanese side will face Scotland at Kingsholm in Gloucester on Wednesday. Also in Pool B are Samoa and the USA. There are two other official World Cup stores in the UK where Japanese fans might want to try their luck, one in Covent Garden in London and another in the St David’s Centre in Cardiff.
