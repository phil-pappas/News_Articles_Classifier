Macau has long established itself as the Monte Carlo of the Orient but the small Special Administrative Region of China has so much more to offer visitors than its famed 24-hour casinos, their glittering lights and upscale retail outlets. \nFrom the Macau Peninsula in the north to the southern islands of Taipa and Coloane, with the reclaimed Cotai Strip in the middle, Macau has attractions that offer thrills as extreme as bungee jumping, food for the soul, unforgettable live performances and lovable pandas. \nAs the first and last European colony of China from the 16th century to December 1999, Macau also has Unesco-inscribed historic sites and flavours that offer its visitors a journey into the past when East met West. \nHere are five places without baccarat tables and slot machines that offer many fun activities for travellers looking for a great Macanese holiday. 1. Historic centre of Macau and Taipa village \nInscribed as a Unesco world heritage site 10 years ago, the heritage centre has more than 20 locations in two zones that uniquely assimilated the Portuguese and Chinese cultures of Macau. The co-existence of the two cultures can be seen today in the squares, the architectural designs of buildings, places of worship and streetscapes. \nIn Zone One between Mount Hill and Barra Hill, one will find the more than 500-year-old A-Ma Temple, Mandarin’s House, Moorish Barracks, the world renowned Ruins of St Paul, Monte Forte, and many heritage churches. \nFirst constructed in 1580, St Paul's Church was damaged twice in fires in 1595 and 1601. Rebuilding started in 1602 and when the church was finished in 1637, it was the biggest Catholic Church in East Asia at that time. But the church was destroyed in a fire again during a typhoon in January 1835, leaving only its facade and stone steps and it was never rebuilt. \nTour guide Danny Leong Chi Wah, who can recite the history of Macau and the background stories behind the heritage sites from the top of his head, had an interesting story to share about the fires that destroyed the site. \nHe said according to local legend, the child deity Na Tcha (Nezha), whose weapons are a fire-tipped spear and wind fire wheels, was unhappy that the Catholic church was grander than his temple so he sent fires to destroy it. \nIn Zone Two is the Guia Fortress – a 17th-century colonial military fort, chapel and lighthouse complex in the St Lazarus parish. \nDown south in Taipa, visitors will find picturesque locations of traditional Chinese shops, colonial villas, churches, temples and restaurants like the 1921 Taipa Houses-Museum on Avenida da Praia. \nStrolling around Taipa Village is fun because visitors will find themselves lost in old narrow streets and alleys where old houses and local businesses are located, like those on Rua Correia da Silva. Then proceed to Rua do Cunha and Rua do Regedor nearby for food. The two streets are lined by little restaurants selling local Chinese and Macanese food, like the Portuguese egg tarts, Serradura (sawdust pudding) and almond cookies. \n2. If there is time to spare when going on the heritage trail by foot, it is good to wonder into the narrow alleys in the city and see how the locals live and do business away from all the hotels, casinos and tourist spots. A detour like that will give visitors a true feel of Macau. – The Malaysian Insider pic, September 14, 2015. House of Dancing Water, at City of Dreams, Estrada do Istmo, Cotai \nPresented by City of Dreams and the Franco Dragone Entertainment Group, the HK$2 billion production is the world's largest water extravaganza since it opened in 2010, offering performances by dancers, gymnasts and acrobats, and dazzling displays of water and special effects. \nThey tell an epic love story of a hero surviving trials after trials to rescue his damsel in distress from her stepmother the Dark Queen. The hero is aided by a fisherman who had fallen into a strange whirlpool and travelled back in time in the first scene. \nIt is so impressive to see the stage transforming between scenes into a solid ground of changing colours and motives, fountains and a pool deep enough for performers to dive from the roof and for huge props – a ship and a Chinese pavilion – to emerge from its depths. \nTicket prices range from HK$406 (about RM220) to HK$980 (about RM530) depending on age group and seat location. \nThe acrobats climbing and swinging from the masts of a ship rising from a pool in the state-of-the-art theatre in the House of Dancing Water. – The Malaysian Insider pic, September 14, 2015. \n3.

It usually takes place on the Macau Tower shorefront every September. \nOn normal days, visitors dine at Macau's highest restaurant 360° Cafe on top of the building. \nThe tower opens daily from 10am to 9am (weekdays) and 9am to 9pm (weekends).

Pier16 Macau 3D World, at Ponte 16 Resort, Pier 16, Inner Harbour, Rua Do Visconde Paco De Arcos \nThe new Pier16 Macau 3D World is where visitors get to have some fun posing with 3D paintings and snap some creative photos to remember their holiday. – The Malaysian Insider pic, September 14, 2015.

Macau Giant Panda Pavilion, at Seac Pai Van Park, Avenida de Seac Pai Van, Coloane \nThe Giant Panda Pavilion is a favourite family tourist destination in Macau as parents bring their kids to look at the two giant pandas, like Kai Kai. – The Malaysian Insider pic, September 14, 2015. Visit the pandas Kai Kai and Yalin at their home – a 3,000 sq m hi-tech facility located against a hill in Coloane, south of Taipa. \nLoved as national treasures, the pandas are so cute despite their huge size and even adults will squeal with delight whenever the bears wander closer to the glass that separate their enclosures. \nThe facility at Seac Pai Van Park is also home to other adorable creatures like ring-tailed lemurs, monkeys and birds. \nThe admission fee is only at MOP10 (about RM5.40), and free for kids under 12 and seniors above 65.
