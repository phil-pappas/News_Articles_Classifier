This will include resumption of the American Airlines code-shared connecting service from San Juan’s Luis Munoz Marin International Airport to Douglas Charles International Airport in Dominica, on a daily basis, as well as interline connecting service to JetBlue, Delta and United Airlines, also through San Juan. In the wake of Tropical Storm Erika, all passenger flights to Dominica were cancelled due to weather-related damage at Douglas Charles International Airport.\nSeaborne operated 92 relief flights from August 23 to September 22, 2015 into and out of the region, to include 76 flights into and out of Guadeloupe (PTP) and 18 non-passenger flights into and out of Dominica’s Canefield Airport (DCF) and Douglas Charles International Airport (DOM) in conjunction with Ross University. Many hundreds of medical students, faculty and relief workers were transported during this time, allowing students to start their studies and aiding recovery efforts. During this period, Seaborne Airlines also transported water and other needed relief items to assist with the recovery effort.\nGary Foss, President and CEO of Seaborne Airlines said, “We want to thank Ross University for their massive efforts to move students, faculty and relief workers into and out of the country as well as providing additional ferry service from Guadeloupe to Dominica during this challenging time.” “We also would like to recognize and thank The Dominica Air and Sea Ports Authority, for their round-the-clock work to restore the airport’s infrastructure, allowing the country to be re-linked to the global transportation grid. Their efforts have been nothing less than heroic.”\nSeaborne Airlines, will continue to support the island’s recovery efforts. As previously announced, Seaborne will be accepting items such as over-the-counter medical supplies, non-perishable goods, men’s and/or women’s underwear, bedding supplies, towels, and toiletries. These items can be delivered to Seaborne Airlines San Juan counter at Luis Munoz Marin International Airport or at Seaborne Headquarters in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\nSource:- Seaborne Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T18:02:31.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
