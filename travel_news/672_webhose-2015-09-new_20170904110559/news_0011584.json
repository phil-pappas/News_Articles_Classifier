As we drive up to the gatehouse a camera scans our number plate and smiley staff welcome us by name, take the car to be parked, and whisk us to our cabin – in a converted 1950s milk float, obviously.\nIn 100 acres of farmland north of Oxford, it’s the latest venture from Soho House group. The original, now a honeypot for media and creative types, opened in London 20 years ago. They’ve since popped up in eight cities from LA to Istanbul and also run nine hotels. The Farmhouse is its first “resort”, with 40 cabins among 18th-century buildings. There’s a seven-bedroom farmhouse, a four-bedroom cottage, several restaurants and facilities galore – and you don’t need to be a member to stay.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest\nThe float passes a rosy-cheeked little girl on a Thelwell pony, a beautiful couple on matching Foffa bikes (guests’ height and shoe size are requested in advance, so bikes and wellies await), and waving staff.\n“Surely they’ve all been planted,” said my friend. “It’s all a bit ... perfect.”\nOur cabin, inspired by the website Cabin Porn , is also perfect in its imperfect way, tapping into any Little House on the Prairie fantasies – only with room service on dial-up. Cabins overlook one of four manmade lakes or a stream and are pretty private, and there’s a separate family section. We coo over rocking chairs on the porch, the wood-burning stove, the huge bed, freestanding bath and well-stocked kitchen, with ready-made cocktails in the fridge!\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest\nStaying put is an option (a milk float with bar and bartender will fix you a tipple on the doorstep, and another with a chef will cook breakfast to order), but the facilities are a big part of what this place offers, so we jump on our bikes and go to check out the Farmyard.\nBuilding work isn’t quite finished when I visit, so it’s hard to gauge the atmosphere, but it’s quite buzzy and boy, there’s plenty to see. Around a courtyard are a deli (with cheese room and wine cellar), a cookery school, a pub, a spa, and the Main Barn restaurant. There are sunbeds by the boating lake, an indoor-outdoor pool, stables, tennis courts, five-a-side football, a Teeny Barn with zipwire and wigwam, and there’ll be an ice rink come winter. A bridge leads to an island with sauna, hot tub and ice bath, and there’s a Josh Wood hair salon (the main one is in Notting Hill). A 60-seat Electric Barn Cinema will open soon (a replica of the original in, yep, Notting Hill), as will a gym and Asian restaurant. There’s even a shop selling everything Farmhouse (from crockery to cushions).\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest\nThe Main Barn is a vast space with brick walls, armchairs, open fires and all-day dining (executive chef is Andy Cook, formerly of the Savoy Grill; Tom Aikens oversees the menu). A lot of produce is grown on site: tomato salad with ricotta and nettle pesto is fresh and zingy, halibut with sea vegetables and brown shrimp delicious.\nAcross the yard, the Mill Room pub has a beautiful wooden bar from Chicago, and stays open until the last person leaves (7.30am is the record). There’ll be DJs at weekends, and comedy, and anyone can get up and jam on the drum kit in the corner. A floppy-haired thirtysomething does just that – and we decide it’s time for bed.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest\nNext morning it’s grey and raining, so we curl up on the massive bed to watch a film. There are some great walking and cycling routes, cute villages and Blenheim Palace to explore – but I doubt whether many people leave the Farmhouse bubble.\nI could be mean and point out Soho Farmhouse’s slight holiday camp feel (with yoga sessions instead of knobbly knees contests, of course – though there is crazy golf). But a lot of thought (and even more money) has gone into creating this boho, Truman Show world. If you like your nature on the wild side, it’s not for you. But for those who want a country weekend with the creature comforts (and the beautiful creatures) of London, this is the perfect playground.\n• Accommodation was provided by Soho Farmhouse (0160-869 1000, sohofarmhouse.com ).
