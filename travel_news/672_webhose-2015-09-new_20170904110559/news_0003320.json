They are electric motorcycles, e-maxi scooters and electric three wheelers from e-rickshaws to disruptive new forms of car and car-like vehicle. This creation of major new EV markets is occurring partly because big brands Yamaha and BMW are entering the field, Yamaha with on and off road e-motorcycles and BMW with an e- maxi scooter initially all in 2015. Harley Davidson is getting user response to a first test design of e-motorcycle in 2014. In 2014, Toyota has garnered huge interest with an enclosed three wheel, tilting electric motorcycle, the iRoad. In addition, Chinese companies are newly offering impressive e maxi scooters and three wheel cars and car-like vehicles and at one third of the price. Leaders in sales such as Zero Motorcycles and Brammo are achieving increased sales and going global and there is now a steady stream of new companies offering all these vehicles and most of them have production coming on-stream in 2015-16.\nIDTechEx has therefore timed this report well to assist those in the business and those that must now consider entering it. The report will also be invaluable to the 200 manufacturers of lithium-based rechargeable batteries and 200 manufacturers of electric traction motors for EVs that seek to sell widely including into fast growing new EV markets to get economy of scale and premium pricing wherever possible. The report also services the needs of those in power electronics, potential investors and other interested parties. Forecasts for 2015-2025 are given for the three primary categories and the sub-categories are analysed in detail.\nThis report is brimful of comparisons and technology and market timelines and market forecasts based on extensive interviews and international travel by PhD level analysts to see what is really going on and what will happen next. It is a sister report to the many other reports in the IDTechEx series that cover complete electric vehicles by land, water and air and further detail on components and systems can be obtained from the IDTechEx reports specifically analysing and forecasting those aspects, from motors to fuel cells and supercapacitors.\nDownload the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/2464292/\nAbout Reportbuyer\nReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers\nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com\nFor more information:\nSarah Smith\nResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.com\nEmail: query@reportbuyer.com\nTel: +44 208 816 85 48\nWebsite: www.reportbuyer.com\n releases/electric-motorcycles-and-three-wheel-electric-vehicles-2015-2025-300141363.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/electric-motorcycles-and-three-wheel-electric-vehicles-2015-2025-300141363.html", "https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/2464292/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=BR98620&Transmission_Id=201509101938PR_NEWS_USPR_____BR98620&DateId=20150910", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.reportbuyer.com/"], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T04:46:14.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
