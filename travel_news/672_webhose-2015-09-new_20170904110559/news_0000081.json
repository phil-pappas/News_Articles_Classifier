We are drinking cappuccini in a large square opposite one of the many baroque churches that are dotted across the city, its grandiose façade looming high above us. To our right lies the entrance to one of the most popular and well-known market streets: Vucciria, but it too bears no sign of activity. • Palermo: best hotels, shops and restaurants Located on Sicily ’s north coast, Palermo is different to any other European city I’ve visited. Its architecture, cuisine and customs all bear the marks of varying time periods and historical events. Yet, despite its hectic past with the arrival of the Arabs, the devastations of war and the domination of the Mafia, the city is both intriguing and mesmerising. After coffee we delve into its unexplored core, walking narrow streets awash with political graffiti, before discovering almost-deserted piazzas bearing the busts of Garibaldi and Neptune. We find a market festooned with lights, strung like frosted cobwebs between lampposts and plastered to the sides of buildings like Christmas cake icing. • What to eat and drink in Sicily On all sides are vendors selling crates of rounded aubergine like swelled blueberries of grotesque proportion, trays of silver sardines and bubbling vongole, great harvests of peaches and verdant lemons. The warm, sweet air is a balmy infusion of ripe figs, disrupted every so often by the juices of overflowing bins. With pale skin and limited knowledge of Italian, my foreignness is apparent – to them I am but an observer, a fleeting flâneuse, nameless and at times unwanted. Around us, swarming locals go about their habitual routines, careful to dodge the onslaught of waspish scooters that weave this way and that, before zipping off to places unknown. • Sicily: a new dawn Leaving the chaos and cacophony behind us, we find ourselves in an undistinguished opening blighted by poverty and ruin. Around us rest the remnants of former homes, their crumbling interiors spilling onto the streets, tall buildings gutted during the Second World War. Several boast wallpapers of graffitied blooms, their dusty pink buds scaling the sides as if craving the nourishment of the luminous midday sun. Others are less fortunate – mere shells. Returning to the streets we are lured by the promise of the cathedral with its great towers jutting up into the blue. Looking at it, it is a fine demonstration of Arabic and Norman influences working in perfect sync. On stepping inside, however, you are greeted with a glittering cohort of Baroque and Byzantine decoration, truly a relic of Palermo’s bygone days. • Sicily: readers' tips and travel advice Enter the next round  Email your entry, in 500 words (with the text in the body of the email), to justback@telegraph.co.uk by midnight on Tuesday September 15.
