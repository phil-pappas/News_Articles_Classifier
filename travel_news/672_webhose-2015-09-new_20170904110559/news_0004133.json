The quicker a truck can be processed at the maintenance facility, the quicker it can be returned to service, resulting in more efficient operations. At the upcoming International Construction and Utility Equipment Exposition (ICUEE) , fleet operators can see how Rotary Lift Mach ™ Series mobile column lifts minimize downtime with fast setup features and versatility.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150916/267179\nICUEE will be held Sept. 29 through Oct. 1 at the Kentucky Exposition Center in Louisville, Kentucky . Rotary Lift Mach Series mobile column lifts will be in Rotary Lift booth #3816 in the exhibit hall.\n\"Mach Series mobile column lifts feature fast rise and descent times, so technicians spend less time waiting for the lift before they can start working,\" says Doug Spiller , heavy-duty product manager for Rotary Lift. \"They also come with intuitive controls that make it easy to synchronize each column during the setup process. Automatic steering systems further save time by eliminating the need to manually pump each column before transport, and brakes engage automatically when the handle is released.\"\nTo provide utility fleet service facilities with maximum versatility, Rotary Lift Mach Series lifts can be removed from under a raised truck once the vehicle is lowered onto jack stands. The lift can then be used to raise other trucks for service, preventing bottlenecks of vehicles. In addition to a Mach Series lift, the Rotary Lift booth at ICUEE will include an 18,000 lb. capacity jack stand (model RS18YL) built specifically for heavy-duty use.\nEach Mach Series lift column is powered by batteries and comes with an onboard charger. Since there is no need to plug the columns into power outlets, there are fewer cords cluttering the service bay. The Mach Series lift on display in the Rotary Lift booth at ICUEE will be equipped with a wireless communications option that also eliminates all communications cables. This option (lift model MCHW418) provides a completely clear floor under and around the vehicle.\nTo learn more about Mach Series mobile column lifts and the full line of heavy-duty Rotary Lift products, stop by Rotary Lift booth #3816 at ICUEE, contact your local Rotary Lift distributor, visit www.rotarylift.com/Heavy-Duty-Lifts or call (800) 640-5438.
