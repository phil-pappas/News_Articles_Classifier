After this World Première in Rotterdam the show will be touring internationally from 2017 on.

Some of these designers like Azzedine Alaia , Jean Paul Gaultier and Giorgio Armani have collaborated with the photographer for many years. This exhibition tells a story of contemporary fashion, bringing together works that have influenced a generation of designers, photographers and artists.\nPhotography\nLindbergh works with the most prestigious fashion magazines since the late 1970s, including Vogue , Ha rper's Bazaar and The Face . His approach in fashion storytelling brought also a new vision of photography. Over the years, he has created images that have marked the history of photography, characterized by a minimalist approach. Lindbergh's romantic vision of his subjects offers a new interpretation of women post-1980s. A new generation of models like Linda Evangelista , Naomi Campbell and Cindy Crawford are gathered for the first time in his famous photograph 'Wild at Heart', marking the beginning of the era of top models. In the exhibition, unseen material will be present such as polaroids, storyboards, sets, 'behind the scene' films with muses Kate Moss and Mariacarla Boscono, and video interviews with famous models.\nPeter Lindbergh\nPeter Lindbergh was born in Lissa, Germany (1944) and currently lives and works in Paris , Arles and New York . He has spent his childhood in Duisburg (North Rhine-Westphalia) and studied Painting at the College of Art in Krefeld. In 1971 he turned his attention to photography. Lindbergh's characteristic photographs in black-and-white are influenced by early German cinema, modern dance from the 20's and industrial surroundings.\nNote for press: http://www.kunsthal.nl for info / press images or contact Mariëtte Maaskant communication@kunsthal.nl / +31(0)10-4400323\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=enUK201509109004&Transmission_Id=201509140300PR_NEWS_USPR_____enUK201509109004&DateId=20150914", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150910/265405"], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T11:43:40.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
