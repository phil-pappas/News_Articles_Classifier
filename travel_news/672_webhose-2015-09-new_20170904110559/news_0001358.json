A similar picture is painted for South Korea, which recorded 2.3 million Japanese visitors in 2014 versus 3.5 million in 2012. \n\n\"With China, it has mainly been a problem over political issues,\" said Murakami, pointing to territorial disputes and differing interpretations of history between the two governments. \"Also, big cities such as Beijing and Shanghai have an image of being badly polluted,\" he said. \n\nSouth Korea also has political disagreements with Japan, but the bigger push factor for Japanese tourists was the end of the boom in K-pop imports, explained Murakami. \n\nThe losses experienced by China and South Korea, however, are other destinations' gains. \n\n\"We are seeing strong interest in South-east Asia now, particularly to Taiwan, which is very cheap, close to Japan and where the people have an image of being kind,\" Murakami said. \n\nThailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and Hong Kong are also increasing in popularity, he added. \n\n\"These destinations are popular with groups of women in their 20s to 40s, as well as older couples in their 60s, because they are friendly, easy to get to and cheap.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T10:22:57.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
