With an increase of 4% in international tourist arrivals in the first semester of 2015, the sector follows an increasing trend that is estimated to reach 1.8 billion international tourists by the year 2030.\n“Every time we travel we are part of a global movement that has the power to drive inclusive development, to create jobs and to build the sustainable societies we want for our future,” said UNWTO Secretary General, Taleb Rifai in his World Tourism Day message. “This movement also contributes to build mutual understanding and to safeguard our shared natural and cultural heritage,” he added.\nProtecting cultural and natural heritage\nA transformative force, tourism brings livelihood opportunities and helps alleviate poverty, making a genuine difference in the lives of millions of people. At present, international tourism contributes $US 1.5 billion to global trade representing 30% of the world´s service exports, a share that goes up to 45% in Least Developed Countries (LDCs). Tourism also plays a key role in fostering multicultural understanding and contributing to the preservation of cultural and natural heritage.\nThis linkage is particularly relevant as the international community prepares to adopt the post-2015 agenda with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) where tourism has been identified as a sector that “creates jobs and promotes local culture and products”.\nWorld Tourism Day is celebrated on 27 September since 1980. This date coincides with the anniversary of the adoption of the UNWTO Statutes on 27 September 1970.\nAs part of this year’s World Tourism Day celebrations, UNWTO invites all join its Instagram Campaign, by sharing images of the transformative potential tourism can hold.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T02:29:23.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
