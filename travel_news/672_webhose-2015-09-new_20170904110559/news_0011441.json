So reviewing your itinerary and trip strategy is very important in order to be sure that you don’t make any mistakes which can add unnecessarily to your travel costs. \nPlanning for any budget friendly Europe tour requires careful considerations in several aspects, so that you can avoid adding up unwanted costs to the budget. From hotels to flights, train tickets to rental cars there are several things to keep in mind before you go to the bookings. Here are some of the most common mistakes that you must avoid doing while planning your Europe budget tour: \n\nAvoid over-packing your itinerary with too many destinations. Most of the travelers tend to over-pack their itineraries when planning trips to Europe, especially as there are so many wonderful places to visit, that they are spoilt for choices. \nIt’s quite natural as vacation days are limited and trips abroad generally infrequent. So there is a common tendency to try to jam as many cities and places as possible into the trips. But this particular strategy must be avoided in order to get a fulfilling experience in the trip instead of just running around the cities and getting tired. \n\nDon’t always presume that you would require to buy a rail pass. It is a fact that the European rail passes sold to American travellers don’t usually save any money. So it’s always good to avoid spending money on the rail passes, unless you are spending most of your travel days taking long-distance high-speed trains. \n\nSimilarly assuming that you would need to rent a car from day one makes no good sense. Travellers generally opt for a rental car for their trip automatically from the very first day they arrive, picking it up at the airport. But to be true if you are planning to spend at least one day visiting the arrival city, it would be best not to rent that car until you’re leaving the town. This would surely help you save on the car rental and parking. \n\nForget about ditching the traditional guidebooks. Though many people would say that it is quite fashionable to ditch heavy guidebooks in favor of the latest apps and free information that is available on your phone, tablet and laptop thorough the internet. But sometimes going the traditional way can be more rewarding. A good guidebook can greatly enrich your trip and can help you save time and money by allowing you to put away your electronic devices. \n\nAvoid pre-booking the trivial and simple stuffs. Now-a-days it has become extremely easy to pre-book activities in each of the cities you visit. Booking passes or tickets for museums, walking tours, boat cruises and other activities are no pain anymore. However, try not to rush and pre-book for every available small activity as this would lead to risk and wasting cash and causing disappointment if you somehow miss it. \nSo while planning your next Europe budget tours in London , do not forget to keep in mind these important points which would surely prove to be beneficial and satisfying.
