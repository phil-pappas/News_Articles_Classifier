By CNN staff Updated 0750 GMT (1450 HKT) September 18, 2015 This story complements the Culinary Journeys TV series, airing monthly on CNN International. See more of the show here: www.cnn.com/journeys . Share photos of your own Culinary Journeys on Instagram with the hashtag #CNNFood for a chance to be featured on CNN. (CNN) Politics and religion aside, no topic sparks vigorous debate quite like the subject of food. This became all too clear when we asked CNN followers on social media to tell us which dish they feel best represents their country. We received hundreds of replies, leaving us amazed by the sheer diversity of both dishes and nationalities. Here are a few highlights, some lightly edited for length. Spain: Tortilla de patata — Irene Adler (@lamazuca) September 1, 2015 Though some of our Spanish readers gave paella a nod, for Twitter user @lamazuca it's the humble tortilla de patata that best represents Spain. So what is it? Often described as a Spanish omelet -- the name means \"potato tortilla\" -- the basic version is made with eggs and potatoes. Some people like to throw in mushrooms, green peppers or other vegetables. Meat can be added too, such as chorizo or ham. It's a lot thicker than a regular egg omelet, as the following tempting Instagram pic shows. A photo posted by luciia (@luciiapgarcia) on Sep 15, 2015 at 1:17pm PDT Indonesia? Up for debate Quite a few Indonesians responded to our #CNNFood national dish challenge, and by no means was consensus reached. Twitter user LaRatsa singled out gado-gado -- a vegetable salad with eggs, rice cubes, prawn crackers and peanut sauce. A photo posted by @wensuwanto on Sep 11, 2015 at 3:53am PDT Instagrammer Fiascinating thinks Indonesia's rendang is \"definitely mouthwatering,\" while Frisca_alexandra says, \"for me it's nasi goreng.\" The country's most famous curry, rendang takes time and skill to make so it's not a food for every day. The secret's in the gravy, which the beef soaks in for hours until it's splendidly tender . Far simpler is nasi goreng. This take on Asian fried rice is often made with sweet, thick soy sauce called kecap (pronounced ketchup) and garnished with acar: pickled cucumber and carrots. Argentina: Asado The Argentinian asado is a mighty celebration of barbecued meat, with beef being the star. Twitter user @OLGAPLUS4 felt it was a no-brainer when it came to Argentina, saying its national dish is \"asado, of course!\" @Tuttifrutti626 agreed, saying it's \"the most typical Argentinean food.\" The term refers to both a barbecue celebration and a traditional way of grilling meat. A multi-step meal that can last several hours, entrees can include choripan (chorizo in a bun), morcilla (blood sausage) and provoleta (cheese) before moving onto offal such as mollejas (beef sweetbreads), chinchulines (intestines) and rinones (kidneys). The centerpiece of the meal, of course, is glorious grilled Argentinian beef. Philippines: Adobo — YanSupe (@EnnaerSupe) September 1, 2015 It was a tight race among our Filipino readers, with adobo (marinated meat) and lechon (whole roasted pig) both getting multiple shout-outs as the dish that best represents the Philippines. But in the end adobo came out as the big winner, with many passionate cries for the popular one-pot dish made on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. \"Adobo is the dish that is synonymous with the Philippines, a one-pot dish that's simple to prep: pork, vinegar, salt, garlic, soy sauce, peppercorns, bay laurel leaves,\" says Rapha Elle, via Facebook. \"It even tastes better the longer it keeps.\" Norway: Smorbrod As Mikkel Overland proves in his Facebook post below, a country's national dish doesn't have to be its fanciest. We love the simplicity of his shot of a \"smorbrod\" -- or open-faced sandwich. \n#CNNfoodThis is an open faced sandwich with Norvegia cheese and red bell pepper as garnish. It's what 80% of the... Brazil: Feijoada Brazil's national dish? Twitter user @stanley_rocha was quick to suggest \"feijoada,\" a simple yet satisfying meal. As did Facebook user Silvia Oliveira: \"Feijoada (beans) is the food that best represents my country. And it's my favorite as well. We have an unrivaled way of preparing beans.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T08:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T10:25:59.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
