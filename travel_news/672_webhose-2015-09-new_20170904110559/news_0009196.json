That might cause temporary weakness in the shares. The bigger issue is whether the company can maintain its excellent profitability — its return on capital was an impressive 21 per cent last year — as it grows. \nIt may well. Wizz is based in Budapest, making for low costs. Staff expenses were just 7 per cent of revenue in the past year, even lower than Ryanair’s 9 per cent. It operates in an underpenetrated market, central and eastern Europe, where spending power is growing. And it is domiciled in Switzerland, so it paid a tax rate of just 4.5 per cent last year. New aircraft will cut unit operating costs still further (but won’t start arriving until 2019). \nSupport from falling fuel prices is limited. Hedging delays that impact, some gains are lost to exchange rates, and much of what remains is passed on as cheaper tickets. And inflationary pressures lurk elsewhere. So for the 2016 financial year, Wizz expects total costs to fall only slightly. Revenue per available seat kilometre is also expected to drop next year — seat miles flown will grow by almost a fifth, mostly on existing routes. \nIn terms of passenger numbers, Wizz is the size that Ryanair was in 2003. Its shares are fairly highly rated, but expansion to date has been well managed — it is debt-free (excluding capitalised aircraft leases). Local flag carriers such as Lot and Tarom are weak . Low-cost rivals could cause pricing problems — a threat to all airlines. But for now, improbably, no one is laughing at Wizz. \nEmail the Lex team at lex@ft.com Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015. You may share using our article tools.
