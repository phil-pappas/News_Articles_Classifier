This program is a unique event designed to give high-powered MBA student teams an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge, problem-solving skills and teamwork abilities in a formal competition. As part of the competition, teams are given a hypothetical business case to develop business solutions for a current operational, marketing or financial challenge. Each student team then prepares and presents its case before a panel of experienced business leaders from PepsiCo. Teams are judged on their analysis of the case, the likelihood of their recommendations and the value of their presentations. Though three teams are usually selected, this is the first year four finalist teams were chosen due to the effort and capability of the teams. \"We love to challenge MBA students with real-world scenarios, and NSHMBA's Case Competition is an excellent opportunity for students to showcase their knowledge and capabilities to PepsiCo,\" said Thomas Savino , NSHMBA Interim CEO. \"NSHMBA is excited to host this challenging event and proud to have an industry leader like PepsiCo serve as its sponsor for the past 3 years.\" Richard Velasquez of PepsiCo stated, \"I'd like to thank all the student teams that entered the PepsiCo NSHMBA Case Competition. The entries were top quality and highly competitive. The results were so close we've decided to invite an extra team to present at the National Conference in Chicago .
