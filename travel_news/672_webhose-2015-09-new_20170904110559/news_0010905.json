The digital speakers will facilitate clearer projection of voice and sound due to better audio distribution while the digital audio processors will result in increased audio performance. \n“The digital audio processors are specialised microprocessors that have been optimised for the fast operational needs of digital signal processing. With this, our clients are assured their audio requests will be smooth and accurate. In addition, digitalising will improve our monitoring and control mechanism and in turn, help increase productivity levels.” \nThe 190 new digital speakers and digital audio processors are located in the plenary theatre, plenary hall, conference halls 1, 2 and 3, banquet hall and ballrooms 1 and 2. All audio processors in the exhibition halls have also transitioned to digital with the existing speakers maintained in analog format. \nMeanwhile, Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre has reported strong performance in the first half of 2015, having hosted 661 events with a total 778,414 delegates and visitors. These events generated RM264 million for the Malaysian economy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T09:28:41.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
