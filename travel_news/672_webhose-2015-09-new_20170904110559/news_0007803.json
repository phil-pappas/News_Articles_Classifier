Where my Heart Used to Beat is the daring and ambitious new novel by Sebastian Faulks, bestselling author of Birdsong and A Week in December . On a small island off the south coast of France, Robert Hendricks, an English Doctor who has seen the best and the worst the twentieth century had to offer, is forced to confront the events that made up his life. The search for sanity takes us through the war in Italy in 1944, the idealistic work in the 1960s and finally back into the trenches of the Western Front. This is Faulk’s most remarkable book yet, casting a long, baleful light over the century we have left behind but may never fully understand.
