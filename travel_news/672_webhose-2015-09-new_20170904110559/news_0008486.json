Anchovies and walnuts seem like an odd pairing, but it works well and pops up in other dishes too. SERVES 2 INGREDIENTS • 165g linguine • 3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil • 2 cloves garlic, crushed • ½ tsp dried chilli flakes • 50g roughly chopped walnuts • 8 really good-quality cured anchovies, roughly chopped • ½ tbsp finely chopped flat-leaf parsley (optional) • grated pecorino, to serve METHOD Cook the linguine in boiling water. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a sauté pan (or shallow casserole dish) and gently fry the garlic, chilli flakes and nuts for a few minutes. Don’t let the garlic brown. Add the anchovies and press them in the pan with the back of a wooden spoon. They’ll melt in the heat. Before the pasta is quite ready, add three-quarters of a mug of the cooking water to the pan, then drain the pasta and add that to the pan too. Finish cooking the pasta in the sauté pan until it is al dente. The cooking water will reduce to form a sauce with the other ingredients. Add the parsley (if using) and season. You can add another slug of extra-virgin olive oil if you want to. Serve with grated pecorino.
