This is the first time the Fijian carrier has crossed the 100,000 mark for monthly passenger numbers. July is traditionally a peak month in Fiji’s tourism calendar. \nFiji Airways Acting CEO David Bowden commented: “This is excellent news coming off the back of our recently announced highest ever six-month profit numbers. It shows that the whole team is working together to grow revenues by increasing passenger numbers and yield. While there’s obviously no room for complacency, we’re delighted with the July passenger numbers. It’s fantastic to be able to break new ground and to acknowledge the work of the team doing so.” \nOnly last month, Fiji Airways reported an interim six-month operating profit before tax of $17.5m, for the period January 1st to June 30th 2015. The results also revealed an increase of 6.7% in passengers flown for the six months compared to the same period in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-12T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T02:06:18.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
