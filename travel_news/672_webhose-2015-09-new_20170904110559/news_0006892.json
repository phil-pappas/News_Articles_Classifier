The show is the most comprehensive of its type in the region, and is expected to draw more than 10,000 visitors, including 52 official delegations from 45 nations.\nThe U.S. presence at PACIFIC 2015 is being organized by Kallman Worldwide, Inc., the official U.S. Representative of the show, in coordination with numerous government agencies, including the U.S. Commercial Service. The centerpiece of the national effort is the 1,000-plus sqm U.S. International Pavilion, a destination for buyers looking for an efficient way to meet a critical mass of U.S. suppliers, and an on-site business hub for U.S. exhibitors looking to maximize their exposure and time at the event.\n\"When U.S. companies commit to exhibit at PACIFIC 2015, they're saying they believe in the power of this event to attract real business prospects and customers,\" said Kallman Worldwide President and CEO, Tom Kallman . \"As the organizer of the U.S International Pavilion, our team is proud to help our exhibitors capitalize on this influential international business opportunity to grow their share of this important market, and further extend our nation's global maritime leadership.\"\nThe 19 U.S. maritime defense and commercial shipping companies participating in the U.S. International Pavilion at PACIFIC 2015 represent a cross-section of leading suppliers looking for new export opportunities and to strengthen regional business relationships. For example:\nRaytheon Missile Systems will be available during the show to have discussions on Naval Effector solutions for current and future ship building opportunities. Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems will be available for discussions on Global Ship Integration. Specialty Systems, Inc. and RF Products are teaming to provide radio communications systems for the Royal Australian Navy ANZAC fleet, and will be conducting a demonstration of capabilities included on those ships at the show.
