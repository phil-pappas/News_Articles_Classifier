It is said that Lord Ganesha's blessings need to be invoked at most religious ceremonies as he is the one who can remove all obstacles on the road to success. Many families welcome the God at their home for select number of days. We suggest you to truly feel the real gaiety of this festival by planning a short trip to Pune, to sing songs of devotion and celebrate one of the biggest festivals of Maharashtra.\nHead to Pune \nKasba : It's a first Ganpati of honour in Pune, it is also said that this mandal was established in 1893 at Kasbapeth, Pune. The mandal is keeping its first place in immersion since 1894. It is called as 'Gram Daivat' of Pune. The idol was found besides the house of Shri Vinayak Thakar, and then a beautiful temple was built for it.\nDagdusheth Halwai Ganapati Temple: This is one of the most popular temples in Maharashtra and is visited by thousands of pilgrims every year. The Halwai Ganapati Trust carries out philanthropic work from the donations received. The trust operates an old age home called Pitashree at Kondhwa in Pune. The home for the aged was built and opened in May 2003. Also in the same building the trust provides housing and education for 40 destitute children. Other services provided by the trust include ambulance service for poor and health clinics in tribal belts of Pune District. The celebrations during Ganesh Chaturthi are grande.\nGuruji Talim Ganpati: The celebrations at this mandal date back to 1887. This mandal was established even before Tilak started this festival. It was built as a symbol of Hindu Muslim Unity.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T02:50:38.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
