According to Charoen Wangananont, president of the Association of Thai Travel Agents, as of June 2015 inbound Chinese traffic grew nearly 100 per cent compared with mid-2014. \n\nDespite the recent turmoil, Charoen is confident the national target of 28 million visitors in total will be met by year-end, estimating that 7.5 million of them will come from China.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T02:29:50.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
