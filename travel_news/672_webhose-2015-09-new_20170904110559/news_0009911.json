Bali’s markets, or pasar, are an integral component of daily life on the Island of the Gods. Accompanied by the cooking school’s culinary team, guests receive a multi-sensory introduction to the basics of Bali’s unique cuisine and hands-on experience with recognising Bali’s exotic produce including turmeric, lemongrass, palm sugar, chili, and salam leaves.\nThe chef’s menu includes three appetisers and three entrées. Upon reserving their space, guests may choose one item from each menu to prepare. Inspiring visitors to take home much more than a souvenir, cooking school guests will leave AYANA with a timeless ability to prepare Balinese specialties for friends and family back home.\nQuintessential dishes include gado gado, minced duck in banana leaf, sate lilit, beef and prawn satay, grilled snapper wrapped in banana leaf, and nasi goreng seafood. Participants will also learn how to make two staple foundations of Balinese cuisine including Basic Balinese ‘Bumbu’ sambal and Base Genep spice paste.\nHoused within a modern, open-air structure, adjacent to RIMBA Lawn and the new Orchid, Scenography Cooking School is appointed with eight top-of-the-line gas cooking stations and a long table crafted from recycled sailboat wood. A stunning preparation centre, artisan crafted with granite and hand carved wood, is highlighted with copper accents and custom lighting.\nThe building’s modern ambience is infused with a traditional flair, showcasing Bali’s legendary craftsmanship with a traditionally woven ‘alang alang’ ceiling and elegant circular lights adorned with classic black and white floral designs.\nEach class includes a refreshing welcome drink and a delicious lunch. After the lesson, guests are presented with a beautiful certificate that may be framed to preserve the memory. Reservations are required at least 24 hours in advance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T06:58:20.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
