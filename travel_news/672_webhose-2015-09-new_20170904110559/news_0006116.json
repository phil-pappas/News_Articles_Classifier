And, uh, I half expected to be fired or at least not taken serious [sic]. But they took the ball and they ran with it.”\n‘God’s assault rifle’ The assault rifle is inscribed with the words “God Wills It,” along with Psalm 144:1: “Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, and my fingers for battle.”\nAccording to “Mookie,” who claims the rifles have been a hit with the company’s customers, “The Christian symbols would prevent the guns from being shipped to the Middle East.”\n“We sold out of rifles in the first 72 hours and there’s a backlog of several weeks,” he said, declining to say how many have sold.\n“God Wills It.”\n(Screengrab from Spike’s Tactical Crusader PR video)\nThe Florida branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations issued a statement decrying “this manufacturer’s fancy new gun.”\n“This is just another shameful marketing ploy intended to profit from the promotion of hatred, division, and violence,” it said.\nThomas, asserting he is not a bigot, insisted: “If they think the word of Jesus Christ causes hatred, they don’t understand Jesus Christ.”", "external_links": ["http://www.cairflorida.org/video/cairfl_calls_new_assault_weapon_inscribed_with_bible_verse_a_shameful_marketing_ploy.html", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/JqjvgTIoOuQ?start=7&#038;feature=oembed", "http://www.spikestactical.com/"], "published": "2015-09-16T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T13:03:16.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
