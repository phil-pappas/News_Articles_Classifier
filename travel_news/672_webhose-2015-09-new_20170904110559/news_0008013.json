This is the first time Tucson , which received a significant redesign for the 2016 model year, has received the highest honor from IIHS.\nIIHS rates vehicles for occupant protection based on performance in five tests: moderate overlap front, small overlap front, side, roof strength and head restraints. Winners of the 2015 TOP SAFETY PICK+ award must earn good ratings in the moderate overlap front, side, roof strength and head restraint tests, as well as a good or acceptable rating in the small overlap front test. Vehicles also need an available front crash prevention system with an advanced or superior rating.\n\"Hyundai's redesign of the Tucson earns the 2016 model our top rating in the small overlap front test, and the Sonata retains its acceptable rating,\" said David Zuby , IIHS chief research officer. \"Both vehicles have an available front crash prevention system that earns a superior rating in the IIHS autobrake test, a key criteria to qualify for a TOP SAFETY PICK+ award.\"\n\"Hyundai's commitment to occupant safety is paramount throughout our entire lineup,\" said Mike O'Brien , vice president, Corporate and Product Planning, Hyundai Motor America. \"We strive to develop technologies that assist in avoiding crashes all together, like forward collision warning, lane departure warning and emergency brake assist, and are pleased the Tucson and Sonata have received these awards related to occupant protection when collisions do occur.\"\nMultiple advanced safety technology options are available on the 2016 Tucson, including AEB with pedestrian detection, Lane Departure Warning System, Blind Spot Detection, Rear Cross-traffic Alert, Lane Change Assist, Backup Warning Sensors and a standard rearview camera.
