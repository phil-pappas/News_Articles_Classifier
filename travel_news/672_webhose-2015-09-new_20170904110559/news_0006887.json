The accreditation, which has to be renewed every three years, is an internationally recognised standard which has been in operation since 1991. It sets the benchmark for excellence in people management and recognises those performing to a high quality in their field. Grass Roots HBi had held the Investors In People accreditation since 2003 but now the entire Meetings & Events division has been awarded the sixth generation Standard. \nThe pilot was officially launched at Bridgewater Hall, Manchester earlier this month. Key speakers for the evening included Paul Devoy, Head of IIP, Peter Cheese, CEO of the CIPD and the British cycling hero Sir Chris Hoy MBE. “People management is a vital concern for us so to achieve the sixth generation Standard as an entire division is something we are truly thrilled about,” comments Sue Massey, Operational Director of Grass Roots Meetings & Events. “The accreditation is given to those who are considered great employers, provide a strong workplace and are committed to sustainability. It is something we have actively worked towards over the past year and will continue to improve upon in years to come. Our employees are part of a larger team dedicated to making Grass Roots a success and this accreditation is recognition of that philosophy.” Pilot organisations, including Grass Roots Meetings & Events, were thanked for their commitment to Investors in People at an exclusive dinner held at the Churchill War Rooms, London, on 8 September 2015. Paul Devoy, Head of Investors in People, said: “Meeting the sixth generation Standard is something that Grass Roots Meetings and Events should be extremely proud of, it is the sign of a great employer, an outperforming place to work and a clear commitment to success. I would like to thank every person at Grass Roots for their involvement in the pilot and their collaboration with Investors in People at this important time. Most of all I would like to congratulate them on their fantastic achievement.” As well as the sixth generation standard, Investors in People also unveiled the first ever real-time ‘People Management Dashboard’, giving open access to their performance data. Anyone can now access a unique set of common metrics, showing the management performance of workplaces across the UK.
