More than 20 years ago, while on a weeklong mission trip to Mexico, I encountered my first experience with a failure to communicate. I had my phrase book and had picked up the most important phrases for safety at our job.\nAt the work site, someone was always bringing food, making a snack in an open-air kitchen and generally taking care of us. One afternoon, a sweet girl of no more than 10 brought me what looked like an enchilada wrapped in a sliver of aluminum foil. I recognized a corn tortilla, but the rest was a beautiful mishmash of ingredients lost on all but the cook. I had seen her and her mother simmering a stew over an open flame earlier in the day.\n“ Caliente ?” I asked, proud of my dictionary skills and new word.\nShe shyly answered with a shake of her head, no. So I bit into the heavenly fragrant, tortilla-wrapped goodness with all the gusto of a starving hog.\nNo, caliente it was not. But, oh my heavens, was it picante !\nI had no idea Spanish has two words, whereas we just have hot to mean temperature and flavor. I’ve never made that mistake again. Now I can’t think about enchiladas without the details of that story traipsing through my mind.\nEven though I was never able to determine what I ate that day, when my taste buds returned to normal, I was able to tell it was delicious and mysteriously wonderful. The corn tortilla was no more than a handy way to eat at a work site where tables, forks and plates have no place.\nMuch milder and easier is today’s recipe for Simple Bean and Cheese Enchiladas. Use corn tortillas for a heartier texture, and any salsa for added flavor. Look for traditional vegetarian refried beans with just pintos, water and salt for the healthiest version possible.\nSIMPLE BEAN AND CHEESE ENCHILADAS 6\nwhite or yellow corn tortillas, at room temperature (see Notes)\n1\n(15-ounce) can vegetarian refried beans\n1\ncup finely shredded Mexican-blend cheese\n12\nounces prepared salsa (about 1 1/2 cups) (see Notes)\nOptional toppings: sour cream, lettuce, chopped fresh tomatoes\nHeat the oven to 350 F. Spread each tortilla with an equal amount of refried beans. Top each with about a tablespoon of shredded cheese. Roll the tortillas and place in a small oblong or standard 8x8-inch square glass casserole dish. Pour the salsa over the enchiladas, making sure to cover well. Top with remaining cheese.\nBake for 20 minutes or until heated through and the cheese is bubbling. Serve with desired toppings. Makes 2 to 3 servings; easily doubled.\nNotes: If you don’t have time to bring the tortillas to room temperature for easier rolling, you may heat a bit of oil in a skillet and lightly fry the tortillas to soften them. This adds tremendous flavor but also fat calories.\nAny smooth salsa works well with this recipe. Do not choose fresh tomato salsa that is not cooked. If your salsa is thick, thin it with a bit of water. The salsa should pour easily.\nPER SERVING (2 enchiladas): Calories 293 (12% from fat), Fat 4 g (0.5 g sat), Cholesterol 1 mg, Sodium 1,201 mg, Fiber 13 g, Carbohydrates 52 g, Protein 14 g", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T05:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T00:58:19.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
