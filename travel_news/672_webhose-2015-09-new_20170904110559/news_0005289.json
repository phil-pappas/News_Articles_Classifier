Couple preserve the good life at Public House 1 / 4 Back to Gallery \nThe old train depot in downtown Winters once marked the end of the line for the railroad that rumbled into Yolo County. \nMore than a century later, that same historic building served to jump-start the entrepreneurial dreams of husband and wife, Cole and Sara Ogando . \nThe couple, who had never worked in a restaurant before, let alone owned one, took a leap of faith to open the Preserve Public House on that Railroad Avenue site in 2011. For Cole, a 35-year-old native of Winters, and Sara, 35, who grew up in Fresno, the gastropub was a natural extension of their passion for great food and time-honored traditions. Yolo County Yolo County events: recreation, education, entertainment and food \n“We want to preserve the good life,” says Sara, about their motto. \nAt Preserve, that philosophy is taken seriously, as evidenced by the glassed-walled curing room, used to make coppa, prosciutto and pancetta, as well as by the shelves of jellies and jams, all made in house. The restaurant even offers classes on pickling and jam-making. \n“My grandparents, who still live in town, were very frugal and self-sustaining,” Cole explains. “They had a garden. They made wine. They cured meats. I grew up watching them can all the time.” \nIt was his grandparents’ recipe for jalapeno jelly that made it onto the menu first. Today, it still remains a favorite, with people buying 20 jars at a time to give as holiday gifts. \nOrdering a cheese or charcuterie board is a popular way to experience the different preserves, including apricot-lavender butter, Meyer lemon jelly, and strawberry-fig jam. It’s also a perfect accompaniment to one of the 21 local beers on tap. \nThe spirit of preserving extends to the restaurant’s decor. The couple, and their extended family, who work in construction, did all the renovations themselves on what was formerly a pub, and flooring and carpet store. \nThe furniture bases in the dining room were fashioned from scrap wood reclaimed from a dismantled old barn. Dozens of old cameras that once belonged to Cole’s grandfather serve as art in a glass case. The striking horseshoe-shaped bar resembles a giant wine barrel, thanks to the old staves lining it that came from Turkovich Family Wines, which has a tasting room just steps away. \nMany restaurateurs may dream of opening a place in San Francisco. But not the Ogandos. \n“You can’t just pick this up and move it to San Francisco,” Cole says. “It wouldn’t be as natural or feel the same. This is home.” \nPreserve Public House , 200 Railroad Ave., Winters, (530) 795-9963. www.preservepublichouse.com. \nBay Area freelance writer Carolyn Jung blogs at FoodGal.com and is the author of the “San Francisco Chef’s Table.” E-mail: travel@sfchronicle.com \nThe insider’s guide \nCole and Sara Ogando’s stash of best places to experience Yolo County: \nPalms Playhouse: This is the place for live music. This intimate 220-seat venue is housed in the restored, historic Winters Opera House , one of California’s oldest theaters. It spotlights jazz, folk, rock, country and the blues. 13 Main St., Winters, (530) 795-1825. www.palmsplayhouse.com . \nRaley Field: The Ogandos like nothing better than to take in the Sacramento River Cats minor league baseball games here. The stadium, right on the Sacramento River, is home to the Triple-A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants . 400 Ballpark Drive, West Sacramento, (916) 376-4700. www.raleyfield.com . \nFly Fishing at Putah Creek: It’s the creek that was memorialized in the Creedence Clearwater Revival song, “Green River.” A stream that winds through Yolo County, it was designated last year by the California Fish and Game Commission as both a “Wild Trout Water” and a “Trophy Trout Water.” The former indicates its population of rainbow trout is self-sustaining; the latter that the fish often exceed 18 inches long and are plentiful enough to be catchable on a regular basis. For first-time visitors, Sara suggests taking a guided outing. www.putahcreektrout.org \nRootStock: Not only can you shop for French linens, Spanish cookware, Italian pottery and locally made candles, olives oils and artwork, but you can taste wine here, too. This combination gift shop and tasting room offers glasses and bottles to try from four local wineries. Once a month, it also hosts an open-Mike night for local talent. 22 Main St., Winters, (530) 794-6008. www.rootstockgifts.com . \nHeringer Estates Winery: The local Heringer family has been farming and making wine for six generations. “Their varietals showcase the family pride and care that is put into every bottle,’’ Sara says. “Their Moscato Bianco and Primativo are our favorites, and on our wine menu at Preserve.” Find the tasting room inside the historic Old Sugar Mill, home to 10 other winery tasting rooms.
