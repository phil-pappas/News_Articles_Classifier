(TATIANA RIVERA / THE MORNING CALL) By Sarah M. Wojcik Of The Morning Call contact the reporter Calling all nature fans: Lehigh Valley Greenways celebrating local environmental with festival \nMuch of the work of the Lehigh Valley Greenways organization goes unnoticed. \nFocusing on land conservation, outdoor recreation and environmental education throughout the Valley, the group of more than 20 public and private partners just isn't the kind that attracts flashy attention. But Claire Sadler, conservation coordinator for the Lehigh Valley Greenways said the organization has decided it's time to let the public know what they're all about. 0 \nThat passion for the Lehigh Valley outdoors will be on full display Saturday at the Jacobsburg Environmental Education Center in Bushkill Township during the first-ever Lehigh Valley Greenways Festival. The free celebration, running 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the park, will feature a live animal presentation, guided wildflower walk, loaner fishing rods to fish in the Bushkill Stream, macroinvertebrate studies and a variety of hands-on exhibits for visitors, according to the Sadler. \n\"The Lehigh Valley Greenways Festival will be the first time we are gathering the many partners to provide a fun opportunity for the public to see how our partnerships increase the quality of life in this region,\" Sadler explained in an email. \"We celebrate the accomplishments often with each other as they happen but we want the public to be able to celebrate with us and understand this work that makes the Lehigh Valley a great place to live and visit.\" \nFormed in 2004 as an initiative by the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, the program has helped locally to connect trails, restore stream beds, promote native landscaping and spreading awareness at environmental education conferences, Sadler said. A few of the group's accomplishments include the construction of environmental education centers at Jacobsburg and the Lehigh Gap Nature Center, the conservation of more than 1,200 acres of open space and the planting of close to 3,000 trees in Allentown, Bethlehem and Easton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T22:24:59.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
