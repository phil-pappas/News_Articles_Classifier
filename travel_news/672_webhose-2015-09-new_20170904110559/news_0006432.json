Comment Posted Sep. 2, 2015 at 4:39 PM Updated at 4:39 PM Posted Sep. 2, 2015 at 4:39 PM Holland, Mich. Pearl Mist passengers took the scenic route to Holland on Wednesday, Sept. 2. The 210-passenger Great Lakes cruise ship was detoured to Muskegon when organizers found out on Tuesday, Sept. 1, it couldn’t dock in Holland. There was a conflict with a ship coming into Verplank Dock Co., said Sally Laukitis, Holland Visitors Bureau executive director. The cruise ship was directed to Mart Dock in the Port of Muskegon. After landing in Muskegon, most passengers boarded buses for a 45 minute drive down to Holland where they visited Windmill Island, the Holland Farmers Market and downtown Holland. “They still got to see Holland, so that was great,” Laukitis said. The motor coaches were already scheduled to pick passengers up from Holland docks and take them to the local destinations, she said. “The people wanted to see Holland, in order for that to happen … the motor coaches made a detour up to Muskegon,” Laukitis said. This is the second time Pearl Mist passengers have been thrown for a loop during the Holland stop this summer. When the cruise ship docked for a day visit on Aug. 19, it was forced to stay overnight due to 12-foot waves on Lake Michigan. The ship was stuck in Lake Macatawa waiting for the waves to calm for more than a day, eventually setting sail for Mackinac Island. This is the second season the Pearl Mist, a 355-foot cruiser, has sailed Lake Michigan. It has stopped in Holland regularly during both summers. The luxury liner is believed to be the largest cruise ship ever to enter Lake Macatawa and dock here, Laukitis said in a previous interview. The visitors bureau’s partnership with the Canada-based cruise line helps inject tourism dollars into the local economy. The stop on Wednesday was the Pearl Mist’s final trip of the season. “This was bonvoyage,” Laukitis said. — Follow this reporter on Twitter @SentinelJustine .
