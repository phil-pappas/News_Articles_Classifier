South Dakota is of course also home to Mount Rushmore, the ultimate homage to U.S. presidents, as well as Mount Theodore Roosevelt and Mount Coolidge.\nShort of getting their face carved onto a mountain, as happened for Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt at Mount Rushmore, the highest accolade available to a president is probably having a prominent summit named for them.\nBut, as the politics plays out around McKinley/Denali, an informal review suggests that the highest honors are handed out somewhat haphazardly. Some presidents get two or more. Most get none.\nWith the renaming of Mount McKinley, it appears that the tallest mountain named for a U.S. president is Mount Lincoln, in Colorado, at 14,293 feet.\nWithin the U.S., Mount Adams, in Washington, is the next highest presidential peak, at 12,281 feet.\nThe presidential range in New Hampshire is home to many peaks named for presidents. Mount Washington is at the heart of the presidential range, which also includes peaks named for presidents Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Pierce, and Eisenhower. There’s another Mount Washington in the Olympics range of Washington state, which comes in at 6,260 feet.\nShutterstock.com Mount Lincoln in Colorado now takes the highest honors. Controversy centers on Mount Clay, which the New Hampshire legislature voted to rename Mount Reagan. In 2010, The U.S. Board of Geographic Names refused to go along, however, leaving the peak officially named for the former Kentucky senator and frequent presidential candidate on federal maps.\nOther nations have named mountains for U.S. presidents. Canada named a 13,944 foot mountain in the Yukon for President Kennedy after his assassination.\nAnd in 2009, the island nation of Antigua and Barbuda renamed its highest point Mount Obama. The 1,319 foot rise had previously been known as Boggy Peak.\nHere’s a list of some of the notable mountains named for U.S. presidents.\nMountain Elevation Location Mount Lincoln\n14,293 Colorado Mount Kennedy\n13,944 Yukon, Canada Mount Adams\n12,281 Washington Mount Washington\n6,288 New Hampshire Mount Coolidge\n6,025 South Dakota Mount Adams\n5,793 New Hampshire Mount Jefferson\n5,712 New Hampshire Mount Theodore Roosevelt\n5,676 South Dakota Mount Reagan*\n5,533 New Hampshire Mount Madison\n5,367 New Hampshire Mount Quincy Adams\n5,348 New Hampshire Mount Lincoln\n5,089 New Hampshire Mount Eisenhower\n4,780 New Hampshire Mount Pierce\n4,310 New Hampshire Eisenhower Mountain\n1,980 California Mount Obama\n1,319 Antigua and Barbuda *Approved by state.
