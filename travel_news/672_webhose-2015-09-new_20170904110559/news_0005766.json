Easy rider: How anyone can turn themselves into a Tour de... The ultimate Moroccan surfing adventure: Where professional... They like to moo-ve it! The Swiss village that celebrates... Not that choosing Kandolhu was easy, because the Maldives consists of 1,192 sandy beauties basking in the warmth of the Indian Ocean and each seems as honeymoon-friendly as the last.\nWe have unashamedly gone for the 'honeymoon package'. Well, when else can you justify staying in a duplex villa that is a mere hop between your own pool and the beach?\nNewlyweds Alex and Lauren unashamedly opted for an opulent getaway to celebrate their big day\nThe Maldives is known to be 'honeymoon central' for loved-up couples - and with plenty of beachfront dining options, it's not hard to see why\nOnly 30 villas encircle the island, eight or so out on a pontoon, each adorned with either its own pool or hot-tub and complete with a wine chiller, home to 28 different bottles: rose, sparklers, whites and reds, old world and new.\nOne day, eight of us converge on the dive centre, including German couple Jurgen and Helen.\n'We've done so many dives around the world, but the Maldives is just in a different class,' says Jurgen. 'I don't think there's anywhere better to see the manta rays; they're incredible.'\nA short boat ride from the island we find ourselves at Manta Point.\nWe are taken to the thrall 60 ft or so below, where the mantas come for a clean courtesy of the wrasse. We descend, hook up to a rock and wait.\nWaiting for the mantas is akin to being among rush-hour tropical traffic as clouds of blue-striped snappers, surgeonfish and masked bannerfish pass through.\nOur instructor points out other nautical neighbours from the flamboyant (but deadly) lionfish to parrotfish, giant clams and clownfish. Soldierfish, fusiliers, trumpetfish — there's an entire army down there.\nThe crystal clear Indian Ocean waters are perfect for spotting blue-striped snappers and manta rays\nWhen the mantas arrive from the depths for their spruce-up, they do so with no small amount of grace, narrowly, yet effortlessly, soaring past you.\nThey fly so close with their giant sea wings, you can feel the ripple in the water.\nWe stay anchored to our viewing spot until the wrasse have finished their work and the rays head off to be gloriously majestic elsewhere in the Indian Ocean.\nThe boat trip back to the island is possibly the only time you genuinely converse with the other guests, everyone as excited as each other about what they had just seen.\nOnce back on Kandolhu, every couple returns to honeymoon formation, eyes only on each other. It's not that anyone is being rude or anything, it's just the way it is and, indeed, should be.\nTRAVEL FACTS Kuoni (01306 747008, kuoni.co.uk ) offers seven nights B&B at Kandolhu, Maldives in a Jacuzzi beach villa, including flights with Etihad Airways from Heathrow and transfers from £2,426 per person, based on two sharing.
