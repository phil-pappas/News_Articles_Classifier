The mobile application simplifies the process of complying with Department of Transportation (DOT) hours of service (HOS) regulations and driver vehicle inspection requirements through advanced electronic logging technology. With FieldMaster Logs, drivers simply logon to an in-cab tablet running the application and their duty status automatically updates in real-time so that information is always current for a safer, more effective fleet.\n\"Businesses with fleets need to closely monitor driver logs because mitigating risk is always a priority, and the implementation of electronic recordkeeping is a critical step in that process,\" said John Cameron , general manager of Trimble's Field Service Management Division. \"The launch of our new FieldMaster Logs allows businesses to fine-tune safety initiatives by using mobile technology that enables both the driver and the business to regulate activity.\"\nFieldMaster Logs also makes it easy to complete driver vehicle inspection reports (DVIR), which confirm that vehicles are safe to operate and comply with strict Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulations. The DVIR tool quickly walks drivers through a checklist to inspect tires, brakes, mirrors and other vehicle parts to be sure they are functioning properly before taking the vehicle on the road.\nFieldMaster Logs features include:\nReal-time electronic record keeping of HOS/DVIR activities Support for FMCSA 395.15 standards for monitoring HOS Support for FMCSA 395.16 standards for driver vehicle inspection recordkeeping Automatic calculation of driver availability based on assigned rules Easy access to drivers' duty status and driving history Record storage in compliance with FMCSA requirements Driver alerts to warn of possible violations Advanced DVIR capability to confirm vehicle inspections \"When fleet operators get into trouble with HOS regulations, often it's because of errors or incomplete recordkeeping,\" said Cameron. \"FieldMaster Logs' electronic capabilities simplify the process by allowing drivers to log onto the solution, which automatically records their duty status, significantly improving accuracy.\"\nFieldMaster is a core component of Trimble's Field Service Management portfolio of integrated solutions that includes Fleet Management, Work Management and Driver Safety.
