Both teams successfully completed their expeditions, experiencing challenging high altitude trekking and dramatic scenery.\nThe 2015 Kamchatka team headed to the remote peninsula in eastern Siberia, a truly wild region which only opened up to foreigners in 1990.\nDirector and co-founder of Secret Compass, Tom Bodkin noted, “The Kamchatka peninsula is such a wild and unpopulated place, we are keen to take our pioneering trekking groups there before any serious development begins so they can appreciate one of the world’s last remaining wildernesses.”\nThe natural wild landscapes of the region and the 30 active volcanoes make this region an adventure haven for travellers seeking a challenge.\nThis year the team was lucky enough to spot brown bears, which outnumber humans in the peninsula by 40:1, and reached the summit of Zimina volcano, which stands at 3,080m.\nAfghanistan’s Wakhan Corridor is home to Wakhi and Kyrgyz nomads who call the high altitude valleys where they graze their livestock, “the roof of the world”. Marketing director, Kerry O’Neill, said “Our annual expedition to the Wakhan Corridor is popular with adventurous travellers who see beyond the headlines of known hotspots and who want to experience the real Afghanistan for themselves.”\nDespite delays at the start of the trip due to landslides blocking roads in Tajikistan, the team progressed well and were able to complete the expedition, travelling across the high altitude valleys of the Big and Little Pamir’s, meeting hospitable nomads and sleeping in yurts along the way.\nTeam member Marcus Koehne took part in both expeditions, trekking for 22 days in Afghanistan before meeting the Kamchatka team a week later for another 22 days of volcano trekking.\nBoth expeditions will be recurring in 2016, with a newroute planned for Kamchatka that will allow the team to better explore this little visited part of the world.\nO’Neill continued, “The Internet is full of questions like ‘Is there anywhere left to explore?’ We believe that there are many genuine challenges left, and that many regions, mountains and rivers remain unexplored.\n“There is much opportunity out there for normal people to achieve the extraordinary in the world’s wildest places – and that’s what our expeditions offer. They’re not easy and they’re not guided tours: they’re tough, they’re satisfying and they’re what experienced adventure travellers want.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T22:10:13.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
