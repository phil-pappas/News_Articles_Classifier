Throw in already high debt levels for U.S. onshore oil producers, who leveraged up to ramp up production as oil prices soared, and the recipe is complete for a squeeze. The chart below from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, based on second-quarter results from 44 companies, illustrates the growing chunk of cash flow that goes to servicing debt.\nIf the value of the assets has fallen below the drawn amount of credit at the time of redetermination, the company will need to make up the shortfall, known as the borrowing-base deficit. Therefore, the longer oil stays at depressed levels, the harder it becomes for cash flow generated by the depreciated asset to sufficiently pay back the gap in funding/asset value. Borrowing from Peter to pay Paul works when oil is at $100/bbl. and low-rated energy companies can continue to explore for new assets. It doesn’t work if oil prices remain depressed and funding begins to dry up like the wells themselves.\nSo what’s an energy company to do? It isn’t all doom and gloom.\nThere are several options, but the most relevant might be to “monetize current hedges or lock in hedges” above the banks’ October price deck—the price the banks use to value reserves, the BofA Merrill strategists said.\nA company can hedge by selling part of its expected future production in futures, options or swaps markets—effectively locking in a price. A summer rebound that took the U.S. crude benchmark back above $60 a barrel in June offered some hedging opportunities.\nFor its part, the EIA noted that net hedging assets stood at $8.8 billion in total for the 44 companies it studied as of June 30—the third highest for any period since 2011. Also, oil and gas expenses have declined.\nStill, with redeterminations around the corner, it looks like some companies could face challenges raising enough cast to continue capital spending and meet liabilities, the EIA noted.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T20:30:25.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
