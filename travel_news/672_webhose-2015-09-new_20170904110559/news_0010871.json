These updates will bring the service into today's web standards to benefit the growth of My Private Driver online.\n With a wide range of services, from providing chauffeurs for large group events to personal transportation for the elderly, My Private Driver has pursued a new approach to representing their business online. They have offices in 8 cities, and want their current and potential clients to have a single site that they can find information for all their establishments. The new website is also linked to their social media properties to provide a constant stream of updates for users.\n 2015 has created many new guidelines for websites to adhere to in order to be optimized for search engines. One of the most important aspects is the utilization of responsive design. Click4Corp has implemented a \"card-style\" approach to responsive design. The card concept is similar to what is used in many Google applications, and works well to create a long scrolling site in mobile devices, which is proven to hold user attention longer. The desktop site has organized all of the company's services and information in these cards, which interact on mouse hover to describe what they link to. The interactive elements on the site also convey a sense of attention to detail, as typography and design has been strongly implemented on the new site. My Private driver has truly focused on creating a modern, sleek design to portray their service online.\n The ability for the single website to adapt based on the device and browser it is being viewed on helps to increase the amount of users capable of viewing it. It also provides access for people on the go to find their business through search and also attain information in a timely manner. Social media also plays a large part in customer to business interaction. My Private Driver has created social media as not only a way to communicate with users online, but to provide a news feed for local events for the cities they operate in. They make sure to cover events of all sizes and offer transportation for all of them. With all the additions to their online presence, there will be lots of added efficiency to communicating with users and promoting conversions to their business.\nAbout My Private Driver:\nMy Private Driver (http://www.myprivatedriver.com) provides designated drivers, airport services, personal and medical chauffeurs, corporate transport, as well as transport for weddings and events.
