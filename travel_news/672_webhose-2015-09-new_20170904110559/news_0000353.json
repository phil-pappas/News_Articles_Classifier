But I’m far from retirement, and when I got invited on a girls’ getaway in the great expanse that is the Last Frontier, I jumped at the chance. \nBear-watching was not on the itinerary, but there was lots of bonding over sightseeing and seafood. I traveled with a small group of fun-loving, foodie girls — we called ourselves “Karen & the Funky Bunch.” Turns out getting away from the lower 48 with just the ladies is freeing, empowering, and… truly wild. There’s just a lot of room and reason to play around in Alaska. \nHere are the top 18 reasons you should go on a girlfriends’ getaway in the 49th state. \n1. Because of the Pack Mentality \nThe author and her friends, who called themselves “Karen & the Funky Bunch.” (Photo: Ko Im) \nIt’s easy to travel in a group in this giant state where there’s not a lot of traffic. We piled into a suburban for a road trip out of Anchorage four hours away to Homer. Something about being in an enclosed space together makes for deep discussions and silly jokes, like the bus to summer camp. We shared our wildest dreams and disasters with each other while on the road. Alaska feels like a big, safe space to share secrets. \n2. Because of the Girl (Food) Power \nYou’ll need some extra muscle for these mussels at Captain Pattie’s . (Photo: Ko Im) \nThe 49th state’s food scene is really budding and us gals had a big appetite for dishes full of oysters, clams, and salmon on end. Speaking of food, there are many Alaskan women who help others indulge in it. The female owner behind the tasty Tracy’s King Crab Shack in Juneau is celebrating her 10-year anniversary. Food lover Kelly “Midgi” Moore founded Juneau Food Tours . And mother-daughter duo Mandy and Kiersten Dixon run the hearty La Beleine Cafe in Homer, a must-stop on any Alaskan itinerary. \n3. Because of the Spirits \nBottoms up. (Photo: Ko Im) \nWe deserve a glass, or three. Craft breweries have exploded all over America, and Alaska is no exception. The sweet girl in me delighted in the blueberry-essence vodka from Homer Brewing Company and the new raspberry-flavored wheat beer from award-winning Alaskan Beer Company . My fellow traveling imbibers were all about the Anchorage Distillery . \n4. Because of the Insta-Envy \nThe view from the Land’s End Resort. (Photo: Ko Im) \nMaybe you’re a budding Instagrammer. Our nature pictures were to die for, the social-media envy of all our friends. People love nature photos, and our favorite view was from the window of the Land’s End Resort . \n5. Because of the Perspective \nAn Alaskan yoga pose. (Photo: Ko Im) \nThe expansiveness of the Last Frontier reminded us how little we — and our problems — are. I learned to marvel again and again at the wonder around me with a breath of fresh air while doing sunrise yoga. \nRelated: 8 Money-Saving Tips for Road-Tripping Alaska \n6. Because of the A dult Sleepovers \nThe hotel rooms at the Historic Anchorage Hotel are wide open, like Alaska itself, with big comforters and blackout curtains (I loved putting on a glacial facial mask here). You wake to little songbirds in the morning. \n7. Because There’s So Much Sunlight \nLong days in Alaska. (Photo: Ko Im) \nThe days can be longer here (18+ hours of sunlight in the summer), which means more natural light for group photos. And when you’re having fun, time flies, right? In Alaska, we could partake in more evening activities like taking a midnight hike or a late boat ride. \n8. Because You Can Really Laugh \nWe all shared a LOL-worthy moment at the Haines Brewfest , when drunk festival-goers decided to bare all and get on a Slip N Slide. \n9. Because of the S urf & Turf \nOn a memorable water taxi ride. (Photo: Ko Im) \nThere’s nothing like screaming together over a bumpy ride on Mako’s Water Taxi to Homer. Don’t forget to take a photo to capture the surprise on your wind-whipped faces. We bumped along the beautiful blue to the Tutka Bay Lodge. \n10. Because of the Exploring \nI got your back, girlfriend! (Photo: Ko Im) \nThe best part of a trip to Alaska is going off the beaten path. In my case, it led to an unmarked ship graveyard off Homer Spit Road. Even though it’s possible I might have been trespassing, the pictures alone were well worth it. \nRelated: Cheaper Ways to Visit Alaska — From a Local \n11. Because of the E ducation \nBonding over knowledge can be fun. We learned about Native American life at the Alaska Native Heritage Center and heard about how the indigenous still live with animals in the wild. \n12. Because You Can Fly \nA spectacular view. (Photo: Ko Im) \nSoar across the Alaskan skies with Ravn Air or on a floatlane plane from Rust’s Air Service . It will leave you awe of the glaciers and sky-high views. \n13. Because of the History \nIn many of the hotels — including the restored Historic Anchorage Hote l with its decades-old architecture — you will feel as though you’ve stepped back in time. Some are even haunted, like the Alaskan Hotel in Juneau. \n14. Because You Can Forage \nForaging at Tutka Bay Lodge. (Photo: Ko Im) \nAt Tutka Bay Lodge , you’ll be fed by the cute visiting chefs. You can even dress up in tutus and hold a murder mystery dinner, if you please. There are lots of options, like taking a cooking class with Le Cordon Bleu-trained chefs. We foraged for beach greens to feel like “Survivor” tribe winners. \n15. Because Nature Calls \nWhen else do you have the possibility of encountering wildlife over and over? You might cross paths with sea otters, bears, and eagles, oh my! And you’ll definitely have a whale of a tale to tell. Here, “That’s wild” becomes your go-to caption. \n16. Because of the S hopping \nGreat Alaska shopping. (Photo: Ko Im) \nThere are charming shops, even at the Anchorage Airport. Pretty candles and little trinkets that will trick any child into thinking it’s Christmas. Since winter is coming, you can also stock up on tree ornaments and buy alpaca apparel that will keep you toasty later. The girls bought tanks with indigenous designs from Trickster in Juneau and looked through sea-themed home goods from Blue Urchin in Homer. \nRelated: Behold: Adventure and Beauty in Alaska \n17. Because of the S torytelling \nI left inspired by the wild story of Mary Joyce, who was a caretaker at Taku Glacier Lodge . A true adventurer, she defied stereotypes by completing a solo dog-sledding trip all the way to Fairbanks. \n18. Because You Must Do This Before You Die \nThe author wrote, “Have a daughter” on this “Before I Die” installation. Cue “aww” alert! (Photo: Ko Im) \nOne of my favorite moments included visiting this inspiring installation in Juneau and finishing the sentence “ Before I die …” Maybe you make a pact to travel together again and never lose your wild streak. Alaska is stunning, just like the women who went on this adventure with me — and you must see it in person, with some witnesses by your side. \nWATCH: How to Be a True Nomad: Milking Camels in Mongolia \nLet Yahoo Travel inspire you every day.
