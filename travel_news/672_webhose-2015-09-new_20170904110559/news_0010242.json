Individual hotels within the market have been posting videos, images, sharing Associate stories and asking the community to recognize individuals who have helped shape Atlanta and made a difference in the community. Just as each of the nearly 85 hotels in the market have helped shape Atlanta, these community members too are #KEY2ATL.\n“A lot has changed in 50 years. One thing that has not and will not is Marriott’s commitment to the city of Atlanta and it’s community. On behalf of Marriott and all the Associates of the Marriott Hotels of Atlanta, it’s been a privilege to be part of the dynamic energy and we look forward to another 50+ great years,” says Atlanta Marriott Marquis General Manager, Erica Qualls-Battey.\nThe community is encouraged to follow our hotels on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram and share their memories, photos and recognize friends, family and neighbors using #KEY2ATL as we all celebrate the great city of Atlanta.\nAtlanta will welcome Marriott’s President and CEO, Arne Sorenson, for the anniversary event on September 28, 2015. The celebration will be hosted at the Renaissance Atlanta Waverly and will include the leadership from our Atlanta hotels, top customers and key business partners\nSource:- Marriott Hotel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T13:21:06.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
