In our continuing coverage on the best places to visit and experience World Cup fever, and explore host destinations this week we take you to Exeter, a city passionate about sport, so visitors coming for RWC 2015 will discover a great atmosphere and contagious excitement running through the city.\nLocated in the south-west region of England in the county of Devon, just over two hours by train from London, Exeter is also an ancient city with a fascinating, rich history to delve into quite literally, in the Underground Passages, a bustling shopping and food market scene. The rejuvenated Quayside is a mix of cafés, restaurants and bars beside the River Exe, while independent shops can be found in the attractive streets behind magnificent Exeter Cathedral and check out Northernhay Gardens, England’s oldest public open space. All this on the doorstep of some of England’s prettiest countryside and coastline!\nWhere are the matches taking place in Exeter?\nHome to the Exeter Chiefs since 2006 and located on the city’s south-eastern fringes, Sandy Park seats 12,500 spectators. Stadium tours aren’t currently available, but fans can take virtual tours, including 360° views, through its official website.\nWhere can you find the Fanzones?\nLocated in Northernhay Gardens, just a rugby ball’s throw from bustling High Street, Exeter’s Fanzone will be open for up to 5,000 people to visit on 13 match days during the tournament, including during Sandy Park’s three matches, and for the Opening Ceremony and Final, before and after which there are special Fanzone events. Entertainment, food, drink and a real tournament buzz are all guaranteed. On days when RWC 2015 matches are not being shown within the Fanzone, ticketed events and festivals are planned.\nWhere else can you watch the match?\nHole in the Wall is Exeter’s premier rugby-watching pub, with all games shown on high-definition big screens. The iconic pub also boasts a new local food menu supported by Devonshire ciders. Alternatively, join students and real-ale fans for matches in The Black Horse.\nAnd where can I eat, sleep and play in Exeter when I’m not watching rugby?\nExeter has a wealth of attractions, hotels, restaurants, bars and events to enjoy:\nTop attractions\nImmediately impressive, walking into Exeter Cathedral is a powerful experience: it is one of England’s most beautiful medieval cathedrals and one of the finest examples of decorated Gothic architecture in this country. Your eyes will be drawn to the longest stretch of Gothic vaulting in the world, and the stunning stained glass windows. A working Cathedral, the building is also a popular tourist attraction. Head on a tour of the roof and enjoy views all over the city. Next, head to the Royal Albert Memorial Museum (RAMM), which recently reopened to the public after a multi-million pound refurbishment. Awarded the national title of “Museum of the Year” (Art Fund Prize 2012), the RAMM’s galleries will absorb your attention for hours.\nExeter is one of the few cities in Britain to offer free guided tours by Exeter’s ‘Red Coat Guides’. Choose from a variety of tours, each focussing on a different aspect of Exeter’s history. You don’t have to book, just choose a tour and meet your distinctively dressed tour guide, and spend 90 minutes discovering Exeter – it’s a great way to meet the locals too. Tours include ‘Churches, Cemeteries and the Catacomb’, ‘Medieval Exeter’ and ‘Murder and Mayhem’! You can also take in one of Exeter’s self-guided city trails and learn about Exeter’s medieval history, woollen trade and the city wall.\nDon’t miss the Historic Quayside, one of the most attractive areas of the city, popular with locals and visitors alike. Admire its striking architecture and enjoy a pint and dinner in one of its lively pubs and restaurants. There are lovely antique shops dotted about, and you can take a boat from there or even hire a canoe.\nFun for the family\nWars and sieges, plagues and pestilence – find out all about them in Exeter’s Underground Passages! Kids and adults alike will enjoy exploring these medieval passages right under Exeter’s High Street, which are narrow, dark, interesting and exciting. Visit the heritage centre before your guided tour, packed with interactive exhibits and interpretation. The Quay Climbing Centre will entertain the whole family, home to the south west of England’s largest climbing wall with more than 200 routes to try at any time. Located in the heart of Exeter’s Quayside in the iconic Old Electricity Building, the climbing space is flooded with light. If you’ve never climbed before, don’t worry – experienced instructors will show you the ropes (quite literally) and kids will feel exhilarated with their newfound skills! Another great family activity is walking or cycling along the beautiful Exe Estuary. There’s a mainly flat cycle route and walkway that runs around the entire Exe Estuary linking Exmouth, Exeter and Dawlish, with fantastic views along the River Exe. There are plenty of places to hire cycles close to the trail.\nShopping\nShopaholics, brace yourselves, Princesshay is located slap bang in the middle of Exeter with the Cathedral as its backdrop, and has more than 50 stores that comprise big-name high-street retailers as well as smaller independent designer boutiques. The Princesshay building is seriously stylish, featuring distinctive architecture, that complements Exeter’s historic buildings, and landscaped European style squares with cafés and restaurants. There’s also a John Lewis department store in Exeter, where you’ll find quality British and international products all displayed temptingly, and staff are renowned for their knowledge and expertise should you have any technical questions!\nExeter is also home to a wealth of chic independent stores that you can’t find anywhere else. Fore Street in the West Quarter is a rare find, not only for its interesting architecture, but for its unusual shops and arcades. Music fans will enjoy Reform Records in the City Arcade, and Manson’s Guitars in the McCoy’s Arcade, as well as vintage store The Real McCoy. Gandy Street, just off High Street in the Castle Quarter, has a range of fab boutiques in an historic setting – try Coco and Iris for fashion, and Kintamani for handcrafted products. Castle Street is great for fashion and jewellery. Harlequins Shopping Centre, just off Queen Street, is linked by bridge to Guildhall Shopping Centre, and has an eclectic mix of shops, many of them designer, and restaurants. Head to Magdalen Road for top-notch local food shopping, including the lovely Bon Gout Delicatessen.\nRestaurants\nEating well in Exeter is easy to do, whether you fancy splashing out on somewhere chic and sophisticated, or cosying up in a friendly pub. If your team won and you want to celebrate in style, book in at Michael Caines at the ABode Royal Clarence, located on the beautiful Cathedral Green. Dine on the finest ingredients and produce from the region, with tasting menus an option for £65 a head, or else a rather good value Table d’Hote lunch menu, with two courses for £14.95 or three for £19.95. Oozing atmosphere and exuding delicious aromas, a night at Southernhay House is guaranteed to be special – the Grade II listed building houses a restaurant, romantic veranda, classy bar and ten lovely bedrooms. Enjoy cocktails before dining in the elegant restaurant on dishes that combine Mediterranean flavours with local Devonian ingredients. Fine dining with a local twist is what @Angela’s is all about – locally caught fish and seafood, and a restaurant that attracts lots of locals, so you’ll feel like part of the city here. The restaurant is tucked away, so you get that extra special feeling of stumbling upon a hidden gem.\nLocal, independent and family run, Harry’s is a fab and fun place to dine, with a line in juicy steaks, burgers and Mexican food – a great place for groups to let their hair down. Rendezvous is another great choice, with its buzzy basement bar and romantic walled garden. It’s a wine bar as well as a restaurant, so a great place for drinks as well as for platters of food.\nIf you’re keen to try out Britain’s famous pub scene, you’re in the right city: Exeter is packed with pubs that offer fantastic food and a welcoming atmosphere. Try the Old Firehouse if you want to sample local ales and ciders, and enjoy the candlelit ambience. It supposedly inspired JK Rowling for the Leaky Cauldron pub in the Harry Potter books, and there’s live music on the weekends. Eat well-priced dinners – a Sunday roast is a must – with prices starting at a reasonable £6.50. More modern in atmosphere, but still stocked with ales – and fantastic cocktails – Oddfellow’s offers the real ‘gastropub’ experience: delicious, stylishly served food in a relaxed pub setting. The Fat Pig is a brilliant venture, ‘all about locally sourced, meat, fish, game, booze, and produce’ with an on-site experimental brewery – so go if you’re a beer buff – and around 100 single malts to please whisky fans. Food is hearty and Saturdays see brunch on the menu, and Sundays the traditional roast lunch. Sister pub The Rusty Bike is equally good, and has fun quirky décor. Ultra cosy and romantic, The Hour Glass is another top pub choice, with real ales a given and a lovingly put together menu that changes every six weeks, with everything cooked to order and made on-site.\nAccommodation\nAt the high end of the accommodation spectrum, the luxurious ABode at the Royal Clarence offers four types of room: comfortable, desirable, enviable and fabulous – the latter has views right over the Cathedral and enough extra special touches that you’ll feel truly pampered. The Southernhay House Hotel’s 10 rooms are all individually designed and named after trades that drove Devon’s economy in the 18th and 19th centuries, like Silk, Spice, Chai and Sugar, and each is tastefully decorated and equipped with luxurious bedding and rain dance showers.\nThe four-star Southgate Mercure Hotel’s rooms have beautiful views of the cathedral and a spa, while Exeter Thistle, The Rougemont is located in a Victorian building right opposite the train station.\nThe Bendene is a charming and central B&B with an outdoor swimming pool and a lovely south-facing garden, while The Clock Tower is another central and reasonably priced option.\nGood budget options in Exeter include the Globe Backpackers, located in an 18th-century townhouse that’s centrally located, and you can also stay in Exeter University accommodation, which is a good self-catering option, and well suited to groups.\nNightlife\nAs well as the fabulous pubs in Exeter – the Old Firehouse is fab for live music on the weekends – you can be entertained at fabulous and award-winning The Bike Shed Theatre, which also has a buzzy and fun bar. Head to former hospital The Cosy Club for an interesting night out – the bar is inspired by an operating table, illuminated with surgical lighting, and there’s a lovely terrace should the weather be balmy.\nEvents not to miss\nContinue your discovery of fantastic local beers at Abbfest, a beer and food festival, held between 18-20 September, which will have more than 160 Devon-brewed beers and ciders and 80 food and craft stalls. And detective story fans, head to nearby Torquay where the annual Agatha Christie Festival is held – it’s the 125th anniversary of the writer’s birth this year, so it’ll be an extra special edition of the event.\nJust as historic is July’s annual City of Exeter Rowing Regatta, south-west England’s biggest regatta and dating to the 1860s. Mid-October, meanwhile, sees the Great West Run half-marathon take place. But rugby union tends to be talk of the town, with the ascending Exeter Chiefs winning the LV Cup, their first silverware, in 2014.\nFurther afield\nEscape to the wild beauty of Dartmoor National Park and admire beautiful Dartmoor ponies, and be surrounded by a dramatic landscape of lofty granite tors, mysterious hut circles, ancient woodlands, rushing streams and acres of fresh air. The park is very close to Exeter, and you can drive to its edge in around half an hour. Once there, you can bask in the tranquillity or get active by walking, cycling, climbing, horse riding, canoeing or ‘letterboxing’ – a Dartmoor activity that combines orienteering with treasure hunting and puzzle solving.\nAnother place of beauty is the East Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), around 30 minutes’ drive south of Exeter and where you’ll find England’s first natural World Heritage Site, the Jurassic Coast. The coast covers 95 miles, starting at East Devon and along into Dorset, displaying 185 million-years of the Earth’s history. There are museums along the coast you can use as starting points for walks, and to see fossils that have been discovered on the coast – head to Exmouth or Sidmouth. The East Devon AONB is also worth exploring, characterised by intimate wooded combes, heathland, fertile river valleys and breath-taking cliffs or hilltops.\nThe Grand Western Canal, at one time used largely for the carriage of limestone, is now a tranquil waterway where you can have a relaxing long walk or cycle ride, or else experience a ride on one of the last horse-drawn barges in the UK. Meandering through 11 miles of pleasant mid-Devon landscape from Tiverton to Lowdswells, the canal’s scenery is constantly changing and there is a wealth of wildlife, including swans and kingfishers. An excellent way to unwind after the World Cup excitement!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:24:16.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
