Even if you have visited South Korea’s capital city numerous times, there is always more to discover when you traverse the same road but see it through new eyes. Here are some ways to do just that. \nBy pedicab \nRickshaws are an entirely novel mode of transportation in South Korea, and the vehicles used by Seoul’s first pedicab company Ride Artee are nothing like the pimped-out rides blasting getai music that Singapore has. In fact, hitching a ride with one of their riders, who double up as in-the-know guides who will show you the sights off-the-beaten-path and relate personal stories while they are at it, is the most tranquil, scenic and decidedly hipster way to experience quaint, pretty areas such as Bukchon Hanok Village and Samcheong-dong’s cafe-lined streets. A 45-minute ride costs KRW45,000 (RM163) and is by reservation only. For more information, visit http://www.rideartee.com . \nBy bumper boat \nThe tubester ride at Some Sevit. At Some Sevit, three small, man-made islands in the Han River that were opened to visitors last year, you can attend arts performances or have a night out at one of the many dining establishments. What you should not miss, though, is the Tubester ride: Tiny, round boats that fit about six people and their drinks. It is up to you to steer your boat clear of other boats but don’t worry, a few collisions only add to the fun. Bobbing up and down on the Han River is a fantastic way to spend time with friends. A 40-minute ride costs KRW30,000 (S$36) per boat. For more information, visit http://www.somesevit.com . \nBy moonlight \nWhile you would have probably visited Changdeokgung, one of Korea’s most beautiful palaces, seeing it by night, after closing time offers some unique views. The very special Moonlight Tour is only conducted during a select few months each year and open to only a limited number of foreigners. So it is not the easiest experience to sign up for but is totally worth it. Not only is the palace stunning by moonlight, the tour includes cultural performances including pansori (Korean opera) and traditional orchestral music. You even get a cute lantern to hold, and traditional snacks and tea are served during the outdoor concert. This year, the tour is open until October 28. Visit http://ticket.interpark.com to purchase tickets at KRW30,000 (S$36) each. ― Today", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T04:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T09:24:51.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
