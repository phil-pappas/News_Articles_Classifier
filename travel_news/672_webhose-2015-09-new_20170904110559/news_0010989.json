Bumbershoot is a three-day, nearly all encompassing conglomeration. This year it will take place from 5th to 7th September.\nBumbershoot, now one of Seattle’s largest traditional touchstones, is a unique and contemporary music and arts festival that brings thousands of people from across the country to the beautiful city of Seattle every Labor Day weekend.\nThis year, AEG Live merged with local producer One Reel in an effort to expand the horizons of the musical line-up. Now Bumbershoot showcases top-tier acts, such as: The Weeknd, Faith No More, Ellie Goulding, Chance the Rapper, Kacey Musgraves, Bassnectar, and a slew of other highlights from a multi-genre perspective. Bumbershoot goes the extra mile in considering kids and offers opportunity for creativity and exploration in the Youngershoot series.\nIt takes place annually in the heart of Seattle at the Seattle Center, a 74-acre parks, arts and entertainment center, which of course includes Seattle’s iconic Space Needle. It all started off with the name Festival ’71 – also known as the Mayor’s Arts Festival — and was free to the public, except for an indoor motorcycle race and a performance by the Retina Circus.\nThe festival is easily reached by flying into Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T03:10:01.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
