Elected officials, and other industry members, including CALSTART, which administers the program for ARB, were in attendance as the recipient, Redwood Products of Chino, CA took ownership of a Hino COE model 195h delivery truck.\nHVIP is the nation's first program to directly reduce the up-front cost of hybrid or zero-emission trucks and buses. HVIP incentives drive manufacturing production and fleet acceptance of the advanced heavy-duty vehicle technologies California must deploy to meet its long-term air quality and climate goals. Redwood Products is the recipient of a $23,000 voucher, which covered close to one-third of the price of a low-carbon Hino hybrid truck.\nSince 2010, ARB has awarded 2,000 vouchers for low-carbon hybrid and zero-emission trucks. \"At Hino, we are committed to doing our part in reducing our carbon footprint and our 195h model is proof in motion of this commitment. Since 1991, we have sold over 15,000 vehicles worldwide using Hino's hybrid technology, making us an industry leader in commercial hybrid product sales,\" said Glenn Ellis , Vice President of Marketing, Product Planning and Dealer Operations for Hino Trucks .\n\"Like other forward-looking companies, Hino Trucks has demonstrated that California's efforts to support cleaner low-carbon trucks and transportation creates a market and a successful business opportunity,\" ARB Executive Officer Richard Corey said.\nThis incentive program has contributed to air pollution reductions in neighborhoods throughout California . Since its launch in 2010, HVIP has provided more than $63 million to help California fleets statewide purchase more than 430 zero-emission trucks and buses and 1,800 hybrid trucks and buses – and additional funding is on the way.\nEllis continued, \"We applaud CARB in their mission to improve California's air quality with the HVIP program, and are excited for our customers to take advantage of this outstanding opportunity to lessen our dependence on oil and create a cleaner California while keeping more of their hard earned money. It is our goal to help support CARB's initiative of accelerating the deployment of hybrid trucks. With our proven track record, we are confident that our customers can capture significant fuel savings, while reducing their carbon footprint in operating our 195h.\"\n\"HVIP has been a highly successful partnership between the State, commercial fleets, CALSTART and industry to help speed clean truck and bus deployment,\" said John Boesel , President and CEO at CALSTART, the national clean transportation non-profit which manages the incentive project for ARB. \"It's for all fleets and all communities to place the most efficient and cleanest vehicles on the road, to help tackle air quality and climate problems and save themselves money.\"\nAbout Hino: Hino Trucks , a Toyota Group Company, assembles, sells, and services Class 4-7 conventional commercial trucks in the United States .
