The news was announced at an awards ceremony on Thursday 24th September at The Ricoh Arena in Coventry. \nDavid Vaughton, director of venues for EEF Venues, said:” It is incredibly humbling to have been recognised in this way by this prestigious new awards programme which shines a spotlight onto Warwickshire’s world class tourism and cultural assets.” Earlier this year, Woodland Grange took Gold in the VisitEngland Awards for Excellence under the Business Tourism category, placing it as the premier business venue in the UK. The venue also won the Customer Care category in the 102 Touch FM Pride of Warwick District Awards this year. Ian Chaplin, general manager of Woodland Grange said: “This latest award shows our business-to-business skills and the consistency of our approach, always tuning into clients’ needs, anticipating requirements and supporting them in their business goals. The greatest evidence of our success is the feedback we regularly receive from our delegates and clients via respected industry benchmarks – and we pay meticulous attention to it. “All credit must go to our teams who build long and lasting relationships with our delegates and bring our facilities to life, day-in, day-out.” The AIM Gold accredited conference centre attracts over 40,000 delegates each year due to its reputation for customer service excellence and bespoke approach.
