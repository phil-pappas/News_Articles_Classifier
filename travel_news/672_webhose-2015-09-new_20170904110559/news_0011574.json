(\"Strategic\") (NYSE: BEE), concerning the proposed acquisition of Strategic by Blackstone Real Estate Partners VIII, L.P., an affiliate of private equity firm, The Blackstone Group L.P. Strategic shareholders seeking more information about this acquisition can contact Carl L. Stine at (212) 759-4600 or cstine@wolfpopper.com .\nThe investigation concerns whether the Company's directors are breaching their fiduciary duties by failing to adequately maximize shareholder value. Under the terms of the proposed transaction, the Company's shareholders will receive $14.25 per share in cash for each Strategic share they own. The proposed transaction has a preliminary equity value of approximately $3.9 billion . However, the offer price is only at a 4.8% premium to the Company's closing price of $13.60 per share on September 4, 2015 , below the Company's 52-week high of $14.41 per share and below the 12-month median analyst price target of $15.19 per share.\nWolf Popper LLP has extensive experience representing investors in mergers and acquisition lawsuits and has successfully ensured that investors receive the maximum compensation.
