Despite many challenges, she enjoyed a career in business support at a further education college for 10 years. Then, in February 2015, she was made redundant. When she made enquiries about new posts, she encountered negative attitudes and discrimination. Only when Eva uploaded her CV to Blue Arrow’s website did she reopen a route back into fulfilling work. “I very suddenly lost my sight at the age of 20 when I was at university. It was terrifying and isolating. I lost all sense of my identity and no longer had a purpose. I became dependent on others. But after two years of surgery and rehabilitation I woke up and decided I needed to take control of my own future. “I had no real experience of work – it scared me a little as I felt I would not fit into a working world. So I undertook a postgraduate programme that incorporated work experience. After qualifying as a career guidance officer I entered work very quickly and found I had skills, qualities and creativity to excel in a people-centred environment. “During my 10 years working in a college, my sight continued to deteriorate but I never gave in and undertook opportunities to develop my career as an equality and diversity professional, resulting in my being employed as a manager. Disability was not a barrier but simply another process to include in the recruitment procedures “Being made redundant was devastating. I felt as I did when my vision went: lost, alone and with no purpose. “I spent six months out of work. Depression and hopelessness took over. I was horrified by some of the feedback I received from employers following my enquiries. I didn’t know there were so many reasons why a blind person would never be suitable for a job. I never even got as far as an interview. “I then decided to upload my CV to a number of job agency sites. Blue Arrow was the first to approach me with a job that seemed a perfect fit. When I disclosed my disability, the adviser wanted to look into what support they could offer and what support I would need. Disability was not a barrier but simply another process to include in the recruitment procedures. “I am now once again an equality and diversity professional in a city-based customer-focused company. I began work in July 2015 on a three-month contract, which has already been extended, and there is a possibility of it becoming permanent. I am treated like a professional again, someone with intelligence, creativity, humour and drive. Money is important as I have a mortgage and bills to pay, but more than that I have goals to achieve, experiences to share and learn from, support to offer other people and something to be part of. “Jobs can change lives. They provide opportunities for personal and professional development. Being back in employment has not just transformed my life it has revived me.” You may also be interested in: • Temp jobs are ideal for aspiring actors • ‘My new job gave me back my career mojo’ • Securing a career after the army • A career that progressed from cleaner to board member", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:02:33.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
