This is 46 minutes faster than the existing 05.30 departure, which requires a change of train and arrives in London at 11.42.\nThe train will also call at Falkirk Grahamston, and will link with the existing 06.26 departure from Edinburgh Waverley. The return service will depart London King’s Cross at 15.00, arriving in Stirling at 20.16.\nCustomers in Sunderland will see a new 05.40 departure, arriving in London King’s Cross at 09.08. With the return service departing London at 20.00, both services will be faster than existing direct trains to Sunderland, by seven minutes southbound and 11 minutes northbound.\nRail Minister Claire Perry said: “The new Sunderland service will provide better journeys for customers across the region and boost economic ties between the north east and the capital, stimulating growth. It will play an important role in our ambitious plans to build a Northern Powerhouse and create a balanced, healthier economy.\n“Along with the additional services for Scotland and Yorkshire, this is further proof that the new East Coast franchise is delivering real benefits for customers across the UK.”\nEarlier this year , Virgin East Coast said it would target business travellers with a range of new initiatives that will be rolled out over the next few years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T12:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T13:36:30.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
