Today, it offers nearly 100 tours a year to destinations from the Amazon to the Arctic Circle. Others — including Girls on the Go, the Wander Girls, and Wonderful World — have followed. Some, such as Soul Purpose Travel, focus on adventure tourism in India, while others, such as Diva Odysseys, offer “bespoke luxury travel” globally. \nThe tours’ popularity reflects the entrenched conservatism of India’s family-oriented society, where men and women are discouraged from mixing freely and women’s conduct comes under intense scrutiny. \nBut these enterprises also say they are helping Indian women discover the world, and themselves, relying on social media and word of mouth to draw clients, whether single, divorced or married with children. \n“In this region, women have been suppressed for many years,” says Piya Bose, a lawyer, who in 2008 started Girls on the Go , which offers about 40 trips a year. “Now many of them are working, they have financial independence and families have opened up to the idea of women travelling on their own. So they are living their travel fantasies.” \nOverall, Indians are travelling as never before, with 9.6m taking foreign holidays in 2014, compared with 3.5m a decade earlier. That is forecast to hit 13.5m by 2020, according to Euromonitor, the research group. Many Indians travel overseas in big multi-generational family groups on whirlwind tours that squeeze in as many landmarks as possible, and offer Indian food all the way. But many prospective women travellers are looking for a more personalised programme and an atmosphere more conducive to camaraderie. I didn’t enjoy it. They were more interested in your background story than the palaces \n- Anupama Mane, a single professional from Mumbai \nAnupama Mane, 48, a single professional from Mumbai, took a mainstream tour to Europe, then vowed never again. She was put off by the frenetic pace and her fellow travellers’ inquisitiveness about her unmarried status. “I didn’t enjoy it,” she says. “They were more interested in your background story than the palaces.” \nFive years ago, she found WoW and has since taken five tours with it. “It’s wonderful going to a different country, and enjoying it with people [with] a similar outlook,” she says. \nFor Ms Dasgupta, her Mediterranean cruise was the start of a travel spree that has taken her to Turkey, Japan, South America and Russia. Aside from seeing the world, she is discovering a rapid transformation — in the psyche of Indian women — as those of all ages and backgrounds travel. “It’s very inspiring.
