MIchael Fassbender in Macbeth 08 September 2015 07:25 AM\nThe UK filmmaker, who previously directed Slumdog Millionaire and Trainspotting, recently directed the Kerryman in his upcoming Steve Jobs biopic. Boyle sang Fassbender’s praises, and said he learned a lot about acting from watching the star work on set with his Oscar-winner co-star Kate Winslet.\n“I learned more about film acting. Especially these two [Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet],” he said.\n“A lot of it is their mental preparation. And it’s not about slavishly learning lines, though in this case it was, because of the nature of it. But the execution of it is simple, in a way.”\nFounder\nThe 127 Hours director applauded Fassbender for his portrayal of the Apple founder in the film, and said he was the perfect candidate for the role.\n“That was real film acting, and I loved kind of recording it, watching it happen,” Boyle told industry site Variety.\n“We set out not to make it slavish and gestural with the hair and everything, because that would be boring and we’d be concentrating on that.”\nAn unfinished preview of the Jobs film was screened at the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado, generating yet more Oscar buzz around Fassbender.\nHe is already tipped to be nominated for the Best Actor gong for his role in an upcoming adaptation of Shakespearean classic Macbeth and now his role in Boyle’s film is being dubbed a possible runner.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/oyFAn5IaFS0", "http://www.independent.ie/incoming/article31496574.ece/f0ece/ALTERNATES/w620/macbeth.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-08T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T14:07:22.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
