Event professionals from across London joined 35 of Westminster’s most unique and prestigious venues, including House of Commons and BAFTA 195 Piccadilly, to discover the marketing consortium’s portfolio of spaces for hire and to network, surrounded by the magic of the festive season \nGuests were greeted by a traditional winter scene complete with glistening snow, vintage sleigh and a life-size reindeer, designed by Event Theming and Prop Hire. A themed Christmas breakfast featured mulled ice tea and Christmas pudding and white chocolate lolly pops, provided by caterer Searcys, while gingerbread cookie decorating, a photo booth with cheerful props and the chance to win some amazing prizes, such as two tickets to Christmas Carols at The Albert Hall, kept guests entertained. No Christmas event would be complete without the man himself and Father Christmas took a break from his busy schedule to add a touch of magic to the day, handing out a selection of prizes and gifts to attendees in return for them making their top wish for their Christmas events and hanging it on the Christmas tree.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T15:32:24.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
