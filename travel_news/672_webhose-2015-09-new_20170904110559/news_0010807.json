A geotechnical assessment will reveal if it is suitable as a hotel site.\n“The EOI process will help narrow down potential sites and design concepts. Depending upon location, either a high end inner city concept or a high quality tropical style resort may be preferred.”\nMr Giles said visitor numbers to the Darwin region were growing rapidly, and more accommodation across the different star ratings was needed.\n“A luxury hotel would help market Darwin as a travel destination through increasing the range of accommodation offerings,” he said.\n“It would also provide an opportunity to attract visitors with high spending and investment potential who may seek to invest in the Northern Territory.\n“The Territory’s economy is performing well with the lowest unemployment in the country and the highest labour force participation rate. A luxury hotel development would mean more economic activity and more jobs for Territorians.\n“It’s all part of the Country Liberals Government’s plan to create jobs and opportunities, drive the development of North Australia and build a $2.2 billion visitor economy by 2020.”\nMr Giles said internationally recognised hotel chains such as the Shangri-La Hotel groups and Accor (Sofitel/Pullman) had shown interest in establishing a brand presence in Darwin, should they find the right commercial arrangement or development partnership.\n“A luxury hotel would give us a significant edge in the lucrative business conference market – which currently injects around $89 million into the economy each year,” he said.\nThe EOI process is likely to comprise a two phase process involving an initial non-binding offer phase, followed by a short-listing process. Short listed bidders would then be invited to submit fully developed and costed final bids.\nAssuming a suitable bid is received, it is anticipated that this process will conclude in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T11:32:31.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
