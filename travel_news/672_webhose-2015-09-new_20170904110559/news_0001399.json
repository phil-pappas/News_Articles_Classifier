(Joshua Trujillo / Seattle Times) Transportation Disasters and Accidents \nThe four people killed in Seattle on Thursday in a wreck that involved a Ride the Ducks amphibious tour vehicle and a charter bus were international students, officials said. The crash also injured dozens of people, several of them critically. \nThe deceased were students with North Seattle College's international program, according to the college . They had been aboard the charter bus, traveling to Safeco Field as part of a new-student orientation program. \n“We’ve had a terrible tragedy,\" Seattle Mayor Ed Murray told reporters. \"There’s been a terrible loss of life.” Seattle tour bus crash leaves several dead, critically injured \nFour people were killed and more suffered critical injuries when a Ride the Ducks tour vehicle and a bus collided on Seattle's Aurora Bridge. \nFour people were killed and more suffered critical injuries when a Ride the Ducks tour vehicle and a bus collided on Seattle's Aurora Bridge.

Two passenger vehicles were also involved in the crash. \nWitnesses told investigators that the duck vehicle may have been dealing with a mechanical issue shortly before the crash, according to a Seattle Police Department news release . But it is too early to draw any conclusions about what caused the wreck, Police Chief Kathleen O'Toole said Thursday evening. \nIt remains unclear which vehicle was at fault in the crash, but police said there was no evidence that drivers were intoxicated or otherwise impaired. \nScenes broadcast by local media showed the crumpled front end of the white duck vehicle against the side of the charter bus. Shattered glass, metal siding and a tire littered the roadway, and the side of the bus appeared to have been sheared off in the collision. \nOfficials did not immediately identify the dead, saying Thursday evening that they were still reaching out to families. \nMurray said he expected people from multiple countries to head to Seattle to see relatives who were affected by the wreck. \"We are not clear on all the countries involved,\" he said. \nMore than 50 people were taken to local hospitals in the aftermath of the crash, and 15 remained in critical condition as of 6 p.m., officials said. \nHarborview Medical Center, which received 18 of the patients, said about 5:30 p.m. that 11 were in intensive care, five were in satisfactory condition, and two had been discharged.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T05:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T02:33:22.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
