It is expected the event will ensure increased expenditure within the Northern Territory economy.”\n“The Territory Government is proud to support this event in association with the team from Summernats and have invested $1 million in the Red CentreNATS.\n“We’ve also allocated a multi-million dollar package of sports infrastructure spending across the Territory, including expansions and upgrades for the Alice Springs Inland Dragway and the Central Australia Drag Racing Association.”\nClose to 400 vehicles have entered in Red CentreNATS so far, with 40% of entrants from interstate – including one New Zealander and the current Summernats Grand Champion.\n“The first Red CentreNATS is going to be great and will set up Alice as Australia’s second home of automotive lifestyle events,” Summernats co-owner Andy Lopez said.\n“The NT Government, the local steering committee, and the City of Alice Springs have all been fantastic in bringing this unique automotive event to life.\n“One of the many great things about the Red CentreNATS is the temporary permit system making it possible for heavily modified cars to cruise the streets of Alice in controlled conditions. Where else but the Northern Territory would you find a Government willing to find a way to make things possible as opposed to throw up road blocks?”\nThe Red CentreNATS will run from Thursday 3 September to Sunday 6 September with the main events at two iconic venues, Blatherskite Park and the Alice Springs Inland Dragway.\nPeople wanting to still enter will need to download an entry form and present themselves and their car during the scrutineering periods of the event on Thursday 3 and Friday 4 September.\nEvents at the Red Centre NATS will include precision driving, street cruising, show and shine, judged competitions and an official Burnout Masters Qualifier. There will also be the Sun 969 Rock N Rumble concert on Friday night, as well as the separately ticketed Podium Party on Sunday night to top off what will be a fantastic weekend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T11:28:16.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
