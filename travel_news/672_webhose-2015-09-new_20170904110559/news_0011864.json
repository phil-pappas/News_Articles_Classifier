Summary \nInstead of boring, ships are interactive museums with something for people of all ages. Here's some tips and ideas for making a historical ship part of your family vacation. \nMy family knows I have a thing for ships. Ever since I watched the Horatio Hornblower miniseries 20 years ago, the sea and the romance of sailing have fascinated me. \nThere are pictures of frigates in my office, I wear an anchor necklace, I have a subscription to Marlinspike Magazine, and I follow different historical ships on Facebook. My copies of C.S. Forester, Robert Lewis Stevenson and Richard Woodman novels have been read so often that they're nearly falling apart. So a few summers ago as we planned our family vacation to Europe, it didn’t surprise anyone that a few ship visits were included in the itinerary. \nThe real surprise happened when we all — and I mean all — ended up enjoying it. \nA ship is a museum. Every one I’ve visited has been presented differently — some with interactive exhibits, some with tours and others with military personnel available to answer questions. \nWhile there are certainly plenty of interesting facts to learn and stories to hear, the thing my family has come to appreciate most is that children can touch nearly everything: models of ships, old pirate flags, tea you can throw overboard, ropes to pull, uniforms to try on — and that's just the beginning. \nSome ships allow you to lie down in the captain’s berth or heft cannonballs. Others have interactive exhibits demonstrating how sailors navigated or tied knots. \nOn the Star of India in San Diego Bay, there is a children’s area with costumes, mops to swab the deck and pulleys to practice moving cargo. Adults can read about the history of the ship and study the detailed models aboard. A variety of vessels from a range of time periods are docked at the same marina, which offers fascinating insight into the differences and similarities in sailing technology over centuries. \nThe USS Constitution in Boston Harbor has a fantastic children’s area in the museum next door where guests can swing in a hammock, pound oakum between deck boards, shake weevils out of hardtack, or climb the lines and reef the sails. My friend and I visited during the huge snowstorm in February, so we had the place to ourselves. Officers were on hand to answer questions and give us a personalized tour. This ship was nicknamed \"Old Ironsides\" because British cannonballs could never penetrate its strong hull during the War of 1812. \nThe museum at the HMS Victory in Portsmouth, U.K., tells the history of the British Navy from the earliest vessels to modern warships. As guests wander over cobbled streets around the shipyard, it's easy to imagine sailors unloading cargo or preparing to set sail. The different buildings house museums and even a small shipbuilding center where carpenters demonstrate the woodworking techniques of a pre-industrial era. An entire section is dedicated to Admiral Horatio Nelson, and there's another area with a pirate display. \nOn the Queen Mary in Long Beach, California, you can try your hand at aiming anti-aircraft guns or eat in an elegant dining room. The ship began as a luxury liner but was also used to transport troops during World War II. Hitler issued a reward for sinking it, but the ship was never found by the Axis forces. The Ghosts & Legends tour is great for some laughs, and I particularly loved the picture gallery of celebrities who had sailed aboard. Beside the ship is a Cold War-era Russian submarine where you can climb through tight doorways, see the torpedoes and look through a periscope. \nOne of my very favorite ships is the Columbia at Disneyland. It's a full-scale replica of an 18th-century American three-masted trading ship built in Massachusetts. The original, the Columbia Rediviva, explored the Pacific Northwest back in the frontier days. The Columbia River was named after the ship, which in 1790 became the first American ship to sail around the globe. \nNot only can you take your family to museum ships anchored in a harbor, but some companies will also allow visitors to actually go to sea. Grays Harbor in Washington has various sailing trips, some lasting a few hours and others for weeks. I'm hoping to talk my family into the Two Weeks Before the Mast adventure one of these days. \nThe East Coast is famous for its tall ship gatherings, giving visitors the opportunity to experience more than one ship at a time, from modern windjammers to old pirate ships. The Philadelphia Tall Ship Festival offers tours, excursions, fireworks and even a parade down the Delaware River. Famous historical ships such as the Galleon from St. Augustine and the Hermione from France are participating this year. \nHere are a few tips to help you get the most out a ship visit: Do your research. Ships — especially old ones — need constant maintenance, so check on the website to make sure they’re open. Ships move. That’s the beauty, right? Just because a ship’s home berth is in a particular place is no guarantee she’ll be there. Weather is a safety issue. Choppy waves and rain make slippery, tilting decks. When in doubt, call ahead. Visiting ships has become a special tradition in my family, and I hope it will be in yours, too. See you on deck, mateys! Jennifer Moore is a romance novelist and a mother of four boys.
