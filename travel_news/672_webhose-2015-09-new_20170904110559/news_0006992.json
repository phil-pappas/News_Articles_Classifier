It's summer in Antarctica that time of year, which means sunlight 24 hours a day, strong winds and an average temperature of minus 20 degrees C (minus 4 F).\nA mandatory seven-day training camp to Lake Winnipeg takes place 10 months earlier, in February 2016, with guidance on endurance training for the trip. The trip will take three weeks, with seven to 11 days riding on the snow from the last degree of longitude to the South Pole. Participants are advised to book an open-ended return flight to allow for flexible timing in case of adverse weather.\nThe group will arrive and depart from Punta Arenas in southern Argentina. From there, they fly to Union Glacier on Antarctica for practice rides, safety briefings and to acclimate to the altitude (some 14,000 feet above sea level). From there, it's a 4 1/2 -hour flight to the South Pole.\nParticipants must bring their own cold-weather gear (sleeping bag, clothes, footwear), bikes suited for snow and ice, frame packs or sled. The trip will be led by Ben Shillington, who has guided adventures around the world. The trip will not have any motorized support or backup; in case of a medical emergency, an evacuation would have to be arranged.\nTDA Global Cycling's other adventure tours have included a number of transcontinental treks: from Cairo, Egypt, to Cape Town, South Africa; from Anchorage, Alaska, to Mexico City; from Cartagena, Colombia, to Ushuaia, Argentina; the \"Hippie Trail,\" from Delhi to Goa, India, and the \"Silk Route,\" from Beijing to Istanbul.\nTDA is also making the February training camp session in Canada, in Grindstone Provincial Park, open for $3,000 to anyone who'd like to try it.\nDetails at http://tdaglobalcycling.com/ .\n___\nHALLOWEEN AT HERSHEYPARK\nHere's one way to make sure Hershey's chocolate is part of your trick-or-treat haul.\nHersheypark, the theme park in the chocolate company's hometown, Hershey, Pennsylvania, hosts Hersheypark in the Dark, Fridays through Sundays, Oct. 16-Nov. 1.\nGuests can choose from more than 50 rides and attractions, including 13 roller coasters. The Laff Trakk coaster, an indoor, spinning glow-coaster, will run in complete darkness the last hour of each operating evening.\nChildren 12 and younger are encouraged to wear costumes and visit the candy trail that starts at Hershey's Chocolate World and continues through Treatville, a seasonal town inside Hersheypark.\nThis is also the only time of year that Hersheypark's ZooAmerica is open after dark. Guests are encouraged to bring a flashlight to see the nocturnal habits of North American species. Admission to ZooAmerica is included in tickets to HersheyPark in the Dark, or you can buy a separate zoo-only admission.\nDetails at www.hersheypark.com/seasons/halloween.php .\n___\nEDITH WHARTON HOME DEBT-FREE\nThe historic home of author Edith Wharton, The Mount, announced Monday that it is debt-free, seven years after defaulting on a loan and nearly shutting its doors.\nThe 1901 estate, which includes a house and gardens, is located in Lenox, Massachusetts, in the Berkshires region. It is a National Historic Landmark, one of just 5 per cent of those sites dedicated to women.\nWharton's best-known works are the novels \"The Age of Innocence,\" ''The House of Mirth\" and \"Ethan Frome.\" She wrote more than 40 books in total, including one on home design, which along with gardening was one of her passions.\nThe Mount faced foreclosure in 2008 when it owed $8.5 million to its lenders. An emergency \"Save the Mount\" campaign included an $800,000 gift from the JM Kaplan Fund. The debt was restructured and The Mount expanded both its fundraising and its mission. Today it offers traditional house museum tours focusing on Wharton's life as well as ghost tours and a tour about the lives of servants. It also serves as a cultural centre for family activities, readings, theatre, music and art, and even hosts weddings and a writer-in-residence program.\nThe additional programming has helped increase visitation by 40 per cent since 2008. The Mount now gets more than 40,000 visitors each year.\nThe Mount's financial stability and increased visibility have coincided with a rise in interest in Wharton's work and her depiction of the Gilded Age of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Last year, it was reported that a cable mini-series version of Wharton's \"The Custom of the Country\" was in development with plans for a starring role for Scarlett Johannson.\nEfforts to revive interest in The Mount and preserve it date to the 1970s. The restoration effort was jumpstarted in 1999 by a $2.9 million grant from the Save America's Treasures program, followed by $1.5 million in matching funds from The Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The house and grounds were restored in the years that followed. In 2006, The Mount acquired Wharton's 2,700-volume library from a private book dealer.\nDetails at http://www.edithwharton.org .\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T18:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T01:58:47.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
