It is leading the development of the one billion dollar Jewel towers project in the Gold Coast.\nDomestic capacity increases (November 2015 – March 2016) Market Extra seats Brisbane 75,000 Cairns 75,000 Gold Coast 110,000 Sunshine Coast 40,000", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T22:57:53.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
