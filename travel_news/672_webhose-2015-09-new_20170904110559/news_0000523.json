Over one billion people cross international borders each year, a number expected to reach 1.8 billion by 2030, while at the same time, billions more travel domestically. This is a sector which will play a very significant role in making progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.\n“Like the Sustainable Development Goals themselves, the Travel & Tourism sector is global and action-oriented. It consists of millions of companies – from the smallest hostel to the largest airline – which together forge an industry which encourages sustainable economic growth, creates jobs, promotes opportunities across society and alleviates poverty.\n“Travel & Tourism has the potential to contribute directly or indirectly to all of the goals. In particular, as one of the largest and fastest growing economic sectors in the world, Travel & Tourism is well-positioned to foster economic growth and create jobs throughout the world to meet Goal #1 “End poverty in all its forms everywhere”. In particular, tourism has been included as a specific target in Goals #8, #12 and #14 on inclusive and sustainable economic growth, sustainable consumption and production and the sustainable use of oceans and marine resources.\n“The Sustainable Development Goals will play a major role in framing our world for the next generation. The Global Travel Association Coalition, representing the major public and private bodies in the Travel & Tourism industry, welcomes their adoption and the part that our sector will play in making them a reality.”\nGoals 8, 12 and 14 specifically mention the role of tourism\n– Goal 8. Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all\n– Goal 12. Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns\n– Goal 14. Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T18:09:29.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
