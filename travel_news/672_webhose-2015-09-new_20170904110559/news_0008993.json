Three ideas to help you escape that urban ennui :\n1. September is farm-tour season around the Northwest, and here’s a chance to enjoy farms and a scenic island at the same time. The Whidbey Island Farm Tour is a free self-guided tour of 11 working farms, spread the length of the long island, where farmers raise more than 200 varieties of fruits and vegetables. Taste locally made cheese, jam or spirits, and see how farms are raising grass-fed and free-range beef cows, goats, sheep, pigs and chickens. Meet alpacas, llamas and horses, too. 10 a.m.-4 p.m., Saturday-Sunday, Sept. 12-13 (some farms one-day only; see map guide for schedule). Download maps here and here .\nSee fleets of classic boats at the Port Townsend Wooden Boat Festival. (Larry Crockett / Port Townsend Wooden Boat Festival) 2. The historic host town is about as salty a community as you can get, and the 39-year-old Port Townsend Wooden Boat Festival is among the leading such celebrations on the planet. Go see how restoration is progressing on the fishing boat that carried John Steinbeck and Ed Ricketts (model for the “Doc” character from “Cannery Row”) on the sea expedition Steinbeck documented in “Log from the Sea of Cortez.” Also: A Coast Guard captain tells of last September’s discovery of the sunken ship of Arctic explorer John Franklin. Meet this year’s Race to Alaska competitors (and see the Second Place Steak Knives!). And — oh, yes — see scores of classic wooden boats with varnish to squint your eyes at, they’re so pretty. (Also, don’t miss our travel story about Port Townsend .) Friday-Sunday, Sept. 11-13, $10-$15, in and around Point Hudson Marina, north end of downtown Port Townsend.\nHead east of the mountains for wine and good food this weekend. (Mike Siegel/The Seattle Times) 3. September is harvest season in Washington’s wine country. Join one of the first crush-season celebrations, Taste of Rattlesnake Hills , in the laid-back wine district of the same name, edging the Yakima Valley. Winemakers will congregate at Paradisos del Sol Winery, in Zillah (one of my favorite town names in Washington, and home of the Church of God-Zillah). Watch the sunset over Mount Adams, listen to music and share their wines. And, really, only the roads are snaky. 5-8 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 12, 3230 Highland Drive, Zillah, Yakima County; free admission; food and wine for purchase.\nBrian J.
