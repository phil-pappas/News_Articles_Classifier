Not your average street food, the gourmet tacos are crafted by Café on the Green at the Four Seasons Resort and Club Dallas and will be offered throughout October. Stuffed with some of the most flavorful and expensive ingredients imaginable, the trio of tacos will put the desire for traditional pico de gallo and guacamole far from your mind. \nEach trio comes with a Wagyu Beef Taco, with Japanese wagyu folded into a blue-corn taco shell and topped with seasonal mushrooms, caramelized onion, micro cilantro, and a truffle béarnaise sauce; Maine Lobster Taco, on a grilled white-corn tortilla with caviar pearls, petite mustard, Aleppo chili, and lime crème fraîche; and a Hudson Valley Foie Gras Taco (named after one of the most elite foie gras suppliers in the United States) on a flour tortilla garnished with duck confit, sea salt, sesame seed, gold leaf, and Valrhona-chocolate mole. \nThe use of premium ingredients carries over to the 4150 Margarita, made with Don Julio 1942 tequila, Cointreau, lime juice, agave nectar, and an edible gold leaf. From the cost of each taco meal, $20 will benefit cancer services at Baylor Charles A. Sammons Cancer Center.
