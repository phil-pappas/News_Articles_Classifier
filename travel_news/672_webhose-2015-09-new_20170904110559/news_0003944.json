The Philippines is targetting the arrival of 10 million foreign tourists in 2016. Asean projects its visitor arrivals to surge to over 160 million by 2025, from some 100 million in 2015. \nThe Civil Aeronautics Board has already recommended to President Aquino the approval of Protocols 5 and 6 of the MAAS, but he has yet to sign the document ratifying the open-skies agreement. Transportation Secretary Joseph Emilio A. Abaya earlier said the government was keen on ratifying the agreement, but the Department of Foreign Affairs wants to modify the ratification document to clarify that the Naia would be open to foreign carriers, “subject to slots in Manila” \nThe Aquino administration had been arguing that congested runways and terminals at the Naia and lack of airport slots as some of the reasons to keep protecting Manila from Asean carriers. This stance is supported by pioneering flag carrier Philippine Airlines. \nThe government has agreed, though, to open up secondary cities to Asean carriers. This would include Clark, Cebu, Davao, Iloilo, Kalibo, to name a few. \nThe Asean open-skies agreement guarantees third, fourth and fifth freedom rights to Asean carriers. Third and fourth freedom rights allow carriers to fly from their home country to another foreign country, sans government approval. \nFifth freedom rights allows any carrier to fly between two foreign countries during flights originating or ending in said airline’s home country. The 10 members of the Asean are Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T22:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T23:52:53.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
