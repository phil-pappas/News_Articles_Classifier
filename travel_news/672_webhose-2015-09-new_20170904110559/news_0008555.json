Its highlights include a second crafting/living room, a bunk room and a retro games room in the garage. Devon travel guide: what to do, when to go Location: 8/10 Accessed via a winding gravel path (the GPS location is inaccurate, so try to arrive by daylight), Meadowgate is surrounded by the rolling green hills of the National Trust-protected Welcombe Valley. Nearby, there’s horse riding at 50-acre Gooseham Barton and – a five-minute walk down a precipitous slope (that’s neither pushchair nor toddler-friendly) – you’ll find Welcombe Mouth. Here there’s a fine view of the Atlantic and excellent rock-pooling, as well as access to the Southwest Coastal Path. Style & character: 7/10 Meadowgate oozes the cutesy country charm you’d expect from Ms Allsopp. The country flourishes are of broad appeal, and include: a five-oven Aga; cosy open fires and wood-burning stoves (protected by fire grilles); and a suntrap garden. The generous apportioning of space in two discrete living rooms and the master bedroom (its ensuite features a roll-top bath with countryside views) also scores points. Kirstie Allsopp's crafty touches may not appeal to everyone, but the cottage has plenty of country charm However, the crafted accessories – which include charity shop prints, gold and black Allsopp-designed loo wallpaper, and repurposed objets trouvés - won’t be to everyone’s taste. Facilities: 8/10 Designed with kids (big and small) and the capricious British weather in mind, there’s plenty to do in this house. The second sitting room is filled with craft projects for chubby fingers, the kitchen table comfortably seats 12 for afternoon tea or board games. The garage game room is a teenager’s dream, and includes ping-pong and Subbuteo tables and a professional dartboard. The master bedroom's claw-footed tub has views over the valley The five bedrooms on the first floor of the main house – one double ensuite, with two additional doubles, a twin and a bunk room fitted with wash basins. The double above the annex extension is also ensuite. Travel cots and highchairs are provided, as are reliable WiFi, iPod docks and barbecuing equipment to make the most of summery days. Small-breed family dogs are also welcome. Value for money: 8/10 From £112pp for a five-night stay based on 14 sharing (£1,572 total, rising to £2,404 is high-season). Eating Sainsbury’s is the only choice for pre-booked supermarket deliveries. Otherwise, there’s a small convenience store at Morwenstow (13 minutes’ drive) and a full range of larger supermarkets half and hour’s drive away at Bude. The 13th century Bush Inn (two miles away) serves locally caught fish and a good ale list and friendly local The Old Smithy Inn (three miles away) serves Devonshire crab and homemade burgers.
