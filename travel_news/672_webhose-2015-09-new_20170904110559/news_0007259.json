The soap opera parading as politics continues. #libspill\n— Paul (@PaulieAbb) September 14, 2015\nAnother year, another prime minister. Saves standing in line to vote.

He will only answer Jarryd Hayne based questions. #auspol #HaynePlane\n— Peter Helliar (@pjhelliar) September 14, 2015 Earlier, Australians have reacted to the news of the leadership challenge in the most Australian way - by taking the piss.\nNot long after the challenge was confirmed, Aussies took to social media expressing their lack of support for the embattled Prime Minister tweeting the hashtag #putyouronionsout.\nThe hashtag is in reference to an incident in March, in which the Prime Minister was filmed and photographed eating an onion with its skin on at a farm in Tasmania.\nIt is also a play on the hashtag #putoutyourbats which began trending on Twitter following the tragic death of cricketer Phillip Hughes.\nOh my.... #putyouronionsout #ohdear #poortony pic.twitter.com/uj0ESFvchw\n— DiabeticDave02 (@DiabeticDave02) September 14, 2015\nTonight we remember the PM that may have been Tony Abbott. #PutYourOnionsOut #auspol #libspill pic.twitter.com/RfQNPa8PZ1\n— John Townsend (@jtwnz) September 14, 2015 Mr Turnbull leadership challenge speech was praised heavily on Sky News by Liberal Party strategist and former John Howard chief-of-staff Grahame Morris.\nMalcolm Turnbull thinks and is articulate. Perhaps he will help the party to do the same. No more slogans (to coin a slogan).\n— Der Papa Guy (@john_yhwh) September 14, 2015 Two lines from the speech are being lauded across Australia this afternoon.\nOne was the bit that went: “We need advocacy, not slogans. We need to respect the intelligence of the Australian people”.\nDoesn’t it feel like a long time since anyone did that?\n'We stopped the boats!' cried Captain Abbott. But he failed to stop the H.M.A.S Turnbull. #FullSteamAhead #Libspill #Auspol\n— Stella Bella (@StellaSpoons) September 14, 2015 The other line which really cut through was this: “There must be an end to the policy on the run and ‘captain’s calls’. We need an open government.”\nAbbott has been warned repeatedly to get rid of Hockey, Credlin etal & if he loses, let him reflect on his misplaced loyalties #libspill\n— Gray Connolly (@GrayConnolly) September 14, 2015 Mr Turnbull went on to explain that he believed in a government which was more consultative, that drew on the wisdom of those beyond the inner circle of cabinet.\n#canningvoters , you get to make your very own Captain's Pick this weekend. Be our voice. Say: ENOUGH. #libspill pic.twitter.com/zFaKNqm8ve\n— Michael Goldschlager (@MGoldschlager) September 14, 2015 And then he did something we haven’t heard Tony Abbott do for a long time. Remember Mr Abbott banging on endlessly about the “budget emergency”, which by the way only got worse under his government?\nWell, Malcolm Turnbull was actually positive! Shock! Horror! The 60-year-old member for Wentworth actually talked up the Australian economy!\nCan’t wait for Tony’s response. Twice as long with only a third of the content. Third of the content. Third of the content. #libspill\n— i am definitely ed (@drearyclocks) September 14, 2015 Here’s what he said.\n“The big economic changes that we’re all living through here and around the world offer enormous challenges and enormous opportunities. And we need a different style of leadership. We need a style of leadership that explains those challenges and opportunities, explains the challenges and how to seize the opportunities. A style of leadership that respects the people’s intelligence, that explains these complex issues and then sets out the course of action we believe we should take and makes a case for it.”\nThese are the sort of words that make you feel Malcolm Turnbull is doing this for the good of Australia, not just for his own political career. Mind you, he is not without just a smidgen of hypocrisy himself.\nFlashback #libspill pic.twitter.com/Bqix9PQSSV\n— SBS News (@SBSNews) September 14, 2015\nAs for whether Tony Abbott can possibly win the challenge, forget it. Former Labor powerbroker Graham Richardson said there’s been a massive change in the “I don’t want to lose my seat faction”. This dry comment was a direct reference to the 30 or so Liberal MPs whose previously safe seats have been made distinctly loseable at the next election due to Mr Abbott’s ongoing unpopularity.\nThe question is whether any of the Labor voters who so much prefer Mr Turnbull to Mr Abbott would actually vote for him? But that’s probably a question for another day.\nMeanwhile, here’s a scene which strongly resembles what we can all look forward to tonight.\nWe now take an exclusive look inside the Liberal party room #libspill pic.twitter.com/Eo6cukzfec\n— Gavin Fernando (@GavinDFernando) September 14, 2015\nOriginally published as How Aussies reacted to new PM", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/PutYourOnionsOut?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/FullSteamAhead?src=hash", "http://t.co/RfQNPa8PZ1", "http://t.co/10If5HijND", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/TonyAbbott?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/helloyabby/status/643397889390080000", "https://twitter.com/pjhelliar/status/643400580954656768", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/libspill?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/LibSpill?src=hash", "http://t.co/zFaKNqm8ve", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/HaynePlane?src=hash", "http://t.co/Eo6cukzfec", "https://twitter.com/architectbarbe/status/643395388930523136", "https://twitter.com/john_yhwh/status/643317690245840900", "http://t.co/Bqix9PQSSV", "https://twitter.com/drearyclocks/status/643307364448382976", "https://twitter.com/MGoldschlager/status/643254215465263104", "https://twitter.com/SBSNews/status/643319490890088448", "https://twitter.com/its_dunks/status/643393404085252097", "https://twitter.com/GavinDFernando/status/643311381572272128", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Auspol?src=hash", "http://t.co/uj0ESFvchw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/putyouronionsout?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ohdear?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/mrdavidwhitley/status/643395572930584576", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/auspol?src=hash", "http://t.co/haTZtmTdYL", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/9News?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/GrayConnolly/status/643304012188512256", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/canningvoters?src=hash", "http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/malcolm-turnbull-just-said-some-stuff-that-just-about-everybody-in-australia-will-relate-to/story-fn5tas5k-1227527038565", "https://twitter.com/PaulieAbb/status/643391552522334209", "https://twitter.com/StellaSpoons/status/643318990270431233", "https://twitter.com/DiabeticDave02/status/643359430847787008", "https://twitter.com/jtwnz/status/643378834125881344", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Libspill?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/poortony?src=hash"], "published": "2015-09-15T06:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T16:12:09.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
