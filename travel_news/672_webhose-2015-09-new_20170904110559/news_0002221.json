Dancing bears, daredevil motorbike stunts and shooting... I'm a big boy now! Heart-warming moment baby elephant thinks... 'I have been fascinated by nature and the absence of human kind.\n'It is also about Mother Earth taking back what once belonged to her and over the years transforming a location more and more.'\nThe morning sun casts a warming light on these stone arches in Cathedral de Vino, Spain, which Jan visited in 2013\nJan used only natural light to illuminate his shots at this abandoned bus station in France, creating an eerie effect\nOnce he has arrived at a suitable abandoned building, Jan looks for interesting light sources, playing around with the likes of shadows in his imagery.\nWhen shooting, Jan only uses natural light to illuminate his shots, resisting the urge to use a lighting rig or even a torch.\nHe also looks for interesting details within buildings, shooting a range of wide angle images, to show decay and scale, as well as close-ups of important items left behind.\nThese items can range from a rusting tool to segments of machinery - all of which help tell the story of the location's past glories.\nThe remains of work at a chemical lab in Belgium are pictured here, with liquids and animal remains still presents in jars\nOld files at a crumbling textiles factory in Spain show much was left behind after the decisions was made too shut down the plant\nThrough the series, the photographer hopes to display an abandoned world that is different from the vandalised buildings that many people associate with decay.\nHe added: 'It's all about feel - being one with the location and waiting for the right moment.\n'I mostly prefer to explore on my own, then all senses are sharp and focused and I can enjoy the full potential of a location that has so much to show.\n'These fascinating places will cease to exist soon and their memories will fade away.\n'I hope to sensitively capture the characteristics of these places before they eventually become lost in time.'\nA blackened abandoned coal-mine reveals hundreds of steel cages hanging from the ceiling in Germany\nDilapidated buses in France reveal how far public transport has come in recent years", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1FDi3Er"], "published": "2015-09-30T16:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T14:07:51.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
