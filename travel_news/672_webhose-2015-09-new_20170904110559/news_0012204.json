We don't believe that a one-size-fits-all approach makes a lot of sense when drones can be used for an ever-growing number of data collection applications,\" said Measure CEO Brandon Torres Declet. \"Our Drone as a ServiceÂ® model is focused on offering turnkey solutions to customers in agriculture, energy, insurance, and infrastructure. With the FAA's approval, Measure now offers the widest range of options on the market.\" \nIn a significant move forward for the commercial drone industry, Measure received the most comprehensive approval to date under the Section 333 process outlined in the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012. In addition, Measure is the first Washington, D.C. based company to receive approval from the FAA for commercial drone flights. \n\"The FAA commercial exemption granted to Measure is significant because it permits a record number of unmanned aircraft system platforms to fly,\" said Brian Wynne President and CEO, Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI). \"Measure is dedicated to providing UAS as a service for a variety of commercial applications and can now operate more unique UAS platforms than all other exempt companies combined. Through this unprecedented exemption, Measure can now deliver the many benefits UAS technology has to offer with the right platform for any scenario.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T05:58:00.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
