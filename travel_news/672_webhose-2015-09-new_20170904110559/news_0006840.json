They are also making Europe be one of the world’s most restrictive regions in terms of visa requirements for foreign tourists, and diverting demand to destinations with an open or a less restrictive visa policy, such as the US.\nMichel de Blust, ECTAA’s Secretary General, said: “Burdensome and costly visa procedures are a deterrent to travelling to Europe. This has a direct impact on the economy in terms of lost visitor spending, business opportunities, employment creation, etc.\nRaphael von Heereman, CLIA Europe Secretary General, said: “As competition from emerging markets continues to grow, Europe’s position as the world’s number one tourist destination is increasingly being questioned. A smarter visa policy is required to increase third-country tourists from emerging countries such as China, India and Russia – all important potential source markets for the European cruise industry.\nBetter realising the potential should help further expand Europe’s cruise industry. It would also allow the tourism sector to contribute further to Europe’s economy, generating much-needed economic growth and employment during this crucial time of economic recovery.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T14:47:30.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
