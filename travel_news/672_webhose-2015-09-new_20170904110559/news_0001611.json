The product, good for 10 flight legs, was displayed at CAD800 instead of the correct price of CAD8,000,\" the statement said. \n\"Once Air Canada became aware of the error on the evening of August 26, the passes were withdrawn from sale and the booking of flight credits was inhibited. Air Canada is contacting purchasers to apologize and provide a refund. However, any flight pass credit bookings already made using the passes will be honoured.\" \nCustomers are furious the airline rescinded the offer. \n\"I don't think they can charge you for something, advertise a certain price, take your money, give you a receipt for it and then unilaterally change their policies to suit their mistake,\" said Risdon. \nA Vancouver-based lawyer said there could be a case for a class-action lawsuit. \n\"There was an offer, there was an acceptance, there is a binding contract,\" said Chris Rhone. \"Now, the onus shifts over to Air Canada to prove some defence to that, such as it was a mistake. In a written contract that can be fairly difficult or they can say there are other terms of this contract.\" Reader's comments Â» \nBy adding a comment on the site, you accept our terms and conditions .
