Starting today, the Belgian airline connects Bremen and Brussels five times a week.\nUntil now, travelling between Bremen and Brussels took minimum 3,5 hours and passengers were obliged to transfer via a foreign airport. Thanks to a new direct connection introduced today by Brussels Airlines, this is a thing of the past. As from tonight Brussels Airlines flies five times a week between the European capital and the important north-German trading city, in little more than an hour.\nThe first flight is festively inaugurated at the airport of Bremen today. “Our new Bremen-Brussels service is excellent news for the numerous business people and EU-officials travelling between Bremen, Bremerhaven, the Lower Saxony region and Brussels”, says Helmut Glaeser, Brussels Airlines Country Manager for Germany. “But we will also have an interesting flight offer for Bremen passengers travelling via Brussels to other destinations in France, Spain and the UK. Moreover, we made a special effort for the airplane constructor Airbus who will now have smooth connections between the different Airbus sites in Bremen, Toulouse, Madrid and Bristol.”\nSource:- Brussels Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T14:45:46.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
