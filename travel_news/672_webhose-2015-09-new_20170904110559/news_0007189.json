The land settled by explorers, missionaries, seafarers and fishermen has grown into a diverse metropolis. \nAnd though time has transformed the 34 miles of waterfront territory into a traveler’s paradise, San Diego’s history lives on in this bustling maritime destination, one that can be enjoyed by land and by sea. This story is provided and presented by our sponsor A glimpse of Old California Cabrillo National Monument and Old Point Loma Lighthouse \nJuan Rodriguez Cabrillo stepped into history as the first European to set foot on what is now the West Coast. The Cabrillo National Monument recognizes his important journey. (Photo: San Diego Tourism Authority) \nWhen Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo first set foot on the west coast of North America on land that would later become California and San Diego, he did so on the shores of what’s now Point Loma. \nAt the end of September each year, locals gather at Point Loma in celebration of his Sept. 28 arrival. The annual Cabrillo Festival reenacts the landing in Ballast Point, a peninsula on San Diego Bay, and celebrates the diverse history of the city with traditional Mexican, Spanish, Portuguese and Native American food and cultural activities. \nYou can explore that history throughout the year at Cabrillo National Monument , run by the National Park Service. Here you’ll find a larger-than-life statue of the man himself. This towering vantage point is also a great place to take in long stretches of shoreline with a panorama of the city, sky and ocean, and to learn more about Cabrillo’s voyage in his discovery of San Diego. Guests can hike, explore the many tide pools and enjoy the quiet and remote coastline that reminds visitors of the California Cabrillo may have encountered. \nThe Point Loma Lighthouse has been welcoming visitors since 1855. (Photo: San Diego Tourism Authority) \nNear the Cabrillo National Monument stands the Old Point Loma Lighthouse, a historic site that has been welcoming visitors since 1855. The structure is one of the eight original lighthouses built along the West Coast. \nA visit to the lighthouse keeper’s humble, yet dutiful abode brings to life the story of early settlers in Southern California. While here, keep your eyes on the water: In winter and early spring, you may see gray whales on the distant horizon as they migrate south. \nContinue your exploration into California’s roots by heading inland to Old Town, a living museum that showcases the history of the region through original and reconstructed buildings, tours, theater shows and more.

(Photo: Maggie Walton) \nSan Diego’s bustling and beautiful bayside is part of what makes the city unique. Walk along the Embarcadero and Seaport Village for iconic views of the cityscape and the calm blue waters, frequently dotted with sails. \nFor a glimpse of the old and new in San Diego waters, take a walk along Harbor Drive. Here you’ll see the contemporary boats of locals alongside the historic vessels that make up the prized collection of the Maritime Museum of San Diego . \nThe magnificent 1863 ship Star of India is the world’s oldest active sailing ship. Next to it is the Californian, the official tall ship of the state of California, and you can also check out the replica HMS Surprise, used in the film Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World . \nThe museum has a world-class collection of historic vessels, including sailing ships, steam-powered boats and submarines that can be explored any time of year. Included in the collection is the San Salvador, a new historically accurate replica of the very ship that brought Cabrillo to shore. The life-size, fully operational recreation of the 16th-century ship – being called the Mayflower of the West – is also a floating classroom that will sail the California coastline beginning this fall. \nIf you’re inspired to get out on the water, board a boat operated by a cruise company (try Hornblower Cruises , Flagship Cruises or another harbor excursion outfit) and sail beneath the Coronado Bridge to photograph some of the best cityscapes in San Diego. This story is provided and presented by our sponsor Celebrating military influences Naval bases and the USS Midway Museum \nThe USS Midway Museum has family-oriented activities for all ages. (Photo: San Diego Tourism Authority) \nThe city has a rich and proud military history. Coronado Island is home to Naval Base Coronado, which consists of eight consolidated military installations; the Navy’s first aviator was trained here. \nTwo giant aircraft carriers, part of the U.S. Navy’s Pacific Fleet, use the peninsula as their home port. Although the naval base and its fleet are closed to the public, guests can take a harbor excursion and glimpse the USS Carl Vinson and USS Theodore Roosevelt if they’re in dock. Each ship is so massive that if stood on its stern, each would be more than twice as tall as One America Plaza, the city’s tallest building. \nCherished by locals, the USS Midway Museum in downtown is an impressive walk through San Diego’s rich military roots and naval history. The museum pays tribute to the 225,000 sailors who served aboard one of America’s longest-serving aircraft carriers. \nFun-for-all-ages attractions include 60 exhibits, a collection of 29 restored aircraft and a self-guided audio tour narrated by Midway sailors. Kids especially enjoy sitting in the cockpits or trying out the flight stimulator. Perhaps most impressive is the sheer size of the ship, 1,001 feet long from bow to stern with a flight deck that takes up just over 4 acres. \nThousands of sailors call San Diego home, and civilians can get a peek into their world during the annual Fleet Week San Diego from Sept. 8 to Oct. 4. Visitors can take tours during the Sept. 19-20 open house at Naval Air Station North Island, or watch the Navy’s famous Blue Angels perform aerial feats during the Miramar Air Show Oct. 2-4, the largest military air show in the United States. Visitors may also catch Navy men and women training with dogged resilience about any day of the year along the narrow Silver Strand beaches.

(Photo: San Diego Tourism Authority) \nLife in San Diego is strongly influenced by the city’s connection to the water, so visitors looking for an authentic San Diego experience should spend some time getting to know the destination’s 70 miles of coastline. \nThe shores of San Diego are the best place to see whales migrating south to the warmer waters of Baja California in Mexico. San Diego Whale Watch pairs guests with a passionate local marine biologist who can help spot and describe the whales, sharks, dolphins and diverse marine species that call these waters home. Peak whale-watching season runs from December to April, so you definitely want to get out on the water then. Some companies operate tours year round. \nA visit to San Diego is not complete without a venture into the water. Surfing is a righteous escape, and a huge part of the San Diegan lifestyle. Locals flock to legendary sands, from Point Loma to Pacific Beach and La Jolla to Oceanside. Beginners can catch a surf lesson before hitting the waves with companies like Pacific Surf School and Surf Diva . \nThis story is provided and presented by the San Diego Tourism Authority , funded in part by the San Diego Tourism Marketing District Corporation with City of San Diego Tourism Marketing District assessment funds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T09:06:56.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
