Police believe the passport is real but have not confirmed his nationality either. \nThai officials have strenuously avoided using the word Uighur largely analysts say for fear of putting off tourists or angering China one of the ruling junta's few international friends. \nPolice chief Somyot linked them to the attack for the first time last week but only in reference to their theory that the blast was conducted by a gang of people-smugglers in revenge for a Thai crackdown on their lucrative trade including the transfer of Uighurs. \nThe mostly Muslim minority have long accused Beijing of religious and cultural repression in Xinjiang with hundreds believed to have fled in recent years often heading to Turkey via Southeast Asia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T21:21:43.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
