After my visit in 2006, I became an Ambassador for Thailand, who ever asked me \"which the most beautiful country in the world\" my answer always is Thailand. By the way my job is Travel Writer and I already visited over 72 countries around the world, my choice to say that Thailand is the most beautiful country based on huge experience as Travel writer, it's not that I choose Thailand between 10 countries, it’s that I choose Thailand as the most beautiful country between over 70 countries. But all might ask me, what make you choose Thailand as the best and most beautiful country, my answer is simple and this is the title of my article \"While in Thailand you feel that all Thai people welcome you.” Let me ask any traveler in the world, what would you expect from visiting a country? Peaceful and welcoming people, nice food, amazing sights, wonders of the world, people helps you and always smiling with you, people believe that you are their guest and they should make your trip a wonderful one, people believe in peace and love. In Thailand, if you are in Business Travel attending an event or an exhibition, you will for sure meet with people of your interests, simply because Thailand is the best place in the world for Meetings and Incentives. Thailand is not only Bangkok, event Bangkok is a very active city, but moving North, South or East of Bangkok, you will find the same hospitality from Thai People. I can write a book about my experience in Thailand and its beauty, but I would prefer to say few words that might make it easy and simple is that \"In Thailand you feel like all Thai People welcomes you\" what else???", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T00:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T02:07:55.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
