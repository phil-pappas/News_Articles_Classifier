Here's where you can head to...\nUpcoming holidays in Oct 2015 \n- Friday, Oct 2, 2015 — Gandhi Jayanti\n- Thursday, Oct 22, 2015 — Dassehra\nFrom Mumbai: Tapalwadi Near Neral, Maharashtra \nET-Travel reader Shezad Mansuri got his friends together and trekked to a place near Neral. He says: We came to know about a place called Tapalwadi, which is a small village and is popular for attracting tourists due to a waterfall nearby. The falls here are not so high but the volume of water flowing is immense. It's beautiful and safe.\n\nThe area is full of lush greenery, which makes it a destination away from the noisy daily commute.\nApart from rafting, rock climbing and rappelling, we found many other smaller waterfalls hidden in Tapalwadi forest area. It was good fun with friends.\nThe trek to the waterfall is moderate. The effort pays off as the natural beauty, gurgling sound of flowing water and cool breeze comes as a welcome change. We too were gently energised and kept trekking ahead.\nWe sat around the shade of tall trees and had a small picnic, taking group pictures and enjoyed our conversations.\nFrom Delhi: Solan, Himachal Pradesh \nPicturesque town of Solan is the largest Municipal Council of Himachal Pradesh , which is located about 46 kilometres south of the state capital, Shimla. This town finds its name inspired by Goddess Shoolini Devi. Every year in the month of June, a fair celebrating the goddess is held, featuring a 3-day mela at the central Thoudo grounds. Solan was the capital of the erstwhile princely state, Bhagat.\n\nVegetation of Solan is particularly of high standard. Mushrooms and tomatoes are grown in plenty and sent to other markets. Interestingly, it is known as the 'Mushroom city of India' due to the vast mushroom farming in the area. The town is situated between Chandigarh (joint capital of Punjab and Haryana) and Shimla (state capital), on the Kalka-Shimla National Highway-22. The Kalka-Shimla narrow gauge heritage railway line, built by the British passes through Solan.\nCuisine & shopping: Himachalis have delicious cuisine and love to host guests. You may find it a little spicy though. Do try Poode and Pachole. Shopping for local handmade decorative items can be done in street boutiques and malls.\nFrom Bangalore: Kunti Betta Trek, Karnataka \nFamilies who like to offer an outdoorsy holiday to their kids can now find some good news in Kunti Betta. It is a picturesque hill in the quaint town of Padavapura , marked by the two hills at an elevation of 2,882m, the Kunti Betta trek has to be a 'must-try' on a trekker's itinerary. Situated in the ancient town, Kunti Betta is famous all over Karnataka for its relatively easy elevations and beautiful pathways. So beautiful is this trail that mythology states that the Pandavas stayed here during their exile and their mother Kunti, made it one of her favoured places.\n\nBeginning from Bangalore, a drive will take you to Kunti Betta in around 4 hours.
