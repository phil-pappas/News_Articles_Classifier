In the end, that’s exactly what happened, except for my next step was something I never could have imagined. \nI was traveling through Europe on a Eurorail pass, and had already visited Berlin, Amsterdam, Paris, and Rome before I decided to go to Granada. The Spanish city wasn’t originally part of my plan, but everyone kept telling me that I needed to see it. \nSo I arrived in Granada with a few friends, and we checked into a hostel. On the 2 nd night, we were all sitting around talking when Tamara walked in alone. To put it simply, it wasn’t love at first sight. I mean, she was gorgeous, but wasn’t really like other girls I had dated in the past. Either way, I invited her over to our group because I wanted her to feel included. \nAt some point in the night, she and I ended up standing next to each other in line for the bathroom. We started chatting, and I quickly realized that I didn’t want to stop talking to her. She was so interesting, and was sharing personal things about herself. She was honest and real, and that immediately attracted me to her. \nLater in the evening, she and I climbed to the top of a nearby mountain and sat there all night talking and listening to music. She asked me to kiss her, and I happily obliged. \nIn Barcelona together after meeting in Granada. (Photo: AlexD’Amore) \nAfter that night, we wanted to spend every second together. I had to go to Barcelona in order to catch a flight home, and she canceled the rest of her plans to spend one day in the city with me. Our time in Barcelona was so special, and I knew in my heart that I wanted to make it work. \nWhen I got back home, I was in the process of moving to Austin. To my surprise, Tamara booked a ticket to Texas, and helped me find a place. I had only known her for like two days, so I must admit that I was a little nervous. But we got along so well during her visit that we decided to make our relationship official. \nRelated: #RealTravel: They Met and Fell in Love While Sailing in the British Virgin Islands \nNow would be a good time to mention that Tamara is from Denmark and I am from the United States. \nBecause of visa restrictions, Tamara had to go back to Denmark after a few months, and I was heartbroken. All I could think about was her, and how we could be together. \nWhen she came back to visit me a few months later, I realized that I wanted to find a job where I could work online so that I could be in the same place. \nI found a job online as a virtual assistant, and although I wasn’t making a lot of money, it was enough for me to quit my job. Tamara was hesitant to follow my lead, but after I proved to her that we could make money, she quit her job and found her own online gig. \nSitting in front of the Oasis Hostel…the place where they first met. (Photo: Sweet Distance) \nVisa laws in both Denmark and the U.S. only allow foreigners to stay in the country for 90 days, which meant that we could never live in the same place. However, in Denmark, a foreigner can apply for residency if they’ve been in a relationship with a Dane for two years. \nSo, we hit the reset button and decided that we would travel for two years. After that, I would apply for residency in Denmark. \nFor our first trip, we went back to the place where it all started: Granada. We visited the hostel where we met, and then climbed to the top of the mountain where we shared our first kiss. Sipping on sangria, we stared out over the city and reflected on the experiences we had shared together. Up until that moment, we were unsure if we could actually travel for two years. But on that mountain, we realized that travel was our one true love, and that the adventure would be possible because we’d be together. \nAfter Granada, we traveled around southern Spain before heading to Portugal. My favorite memory from that part of the trip is playing in the waves in Cascais. It was terrifying and fun — one of those moments where you really feel like you’re pushing the limits. \nTamara playing in the waves in Portugal.

We rented a boat and went from island to island…it was beautiful. \nRelated: I Found Love on My Second Day in Holland \nThen we went to Denmark to spend Christmas with Tamara’s family. The country basically invented Christmas, so it felt like we were living in a fairytale wonderland. The Danish have all of these amazing traditions that just make the whole season seem that much more special. \nAt the beginning of 2015, we headed to South America to spend six months in Argentina and Chile. Then we headed up to Mexico to swim in the world- famous cenotes and visit some ruins. \nStanding in front of Chichen Itza in Mexico. (Photo: Sweet Distance) \nBy this time we were a little exhausted and homesick, so we went to Cleveland to visit my family. Up next was London, where we lived and worked for a few months. Soon, we headed to Poland, Ukraine, Budapest, and Slovenia. \nWe are currently in Croatia and are on day 413 of our journey. We have about a year left before I can apply for residency in Denmark, so in the meantime our next stop is New York City — a place both of us has always wanted to live. \nWhen our country hopping is over, Tamara and I are looking forward to having a settled down life together in Denmark. We fantasize about having simple things, like a gym we can go to, or a room with a TV! \nBut until then, we’re enjoying this crazy ride, and I’m thankful to have found a person who shares a similar outlook on life. \nLet Yahoo Travel inspire you every day.
