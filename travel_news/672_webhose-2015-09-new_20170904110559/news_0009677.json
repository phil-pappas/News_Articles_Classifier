Today, Australia is the fourth largest exporter behind France, Italy and Spain. Their new aim is to take wine tourism to the next level, with holidays visitors will remember for the rest of their lives. From the best regions to the ultimate winery experiences, here is your guide to sipping your way around Australia. Western Australia A few miles from Perth is Western Australia’s original vineyard, the Swan Valley, first planted in the 1830s. A warm region, it’s well suited to tropical fruit-scented verdelhos and sweet, age-worthy fortified wines. There is plenty to take in along the 20-mile Wine and Food Trail with 150 places of interest for gourmet-minded visitors. Margaret River lies 169 miles south, and is one of the world’s most isolated fine wine regions. In its short 40-year history it has taken the world by storm with exceptional cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay and semillon sauvignon blends. There are now some 120 family wineries vying for the world’s attention. The region’s allure extends to ancient forests, splendid Indian Ocean beaches and tourist infrastructure that ranges from simple cottage accommodation to luxury spas and restaurants. Annual events such as The Margaret River Gourmet Escape and Leeuwin Estate’s open air concerts attract the cream of international talent. You never know who you’ll bump into on a winery tour South Australia The southern answer to the boutique wineries of Margaret River lies in the Adelaide Hills. At up to 2,000ft above sea level, the nights are cool, ensuring pinot noir and chardonnay take on a freshness and vibrancy that really sets them apart from their rivals. The Barossa Valley, however, is this state’s beating heart – where wine has been coursing the veins of grape growing families for generations. It’s home to some of the world’s oldest vines planted in 1847 and most famous for smooth, mouthfilling shiraz. The sparkling version too can be incredibly delicious. A vibrant multicultural heritage pervades all aspects of life here with an amazing assortment of fine food, wine and festivals. Tour the region by conventional means or opt for motorbike, vintage car, hot air balloon or helicopter. The cooler Clare Valley to the north produces equally delicious reds and whites but crisp rieslings are this region’s trump card, particularly from around Leasingham and Watervale areas. Victoria In the north of Australia’s smallest state you find a remarkable concentration of unique and highly prized fortified muscats while the much cooler Yarra Valley near Melbourne is known for elegant table wines. The pinot noir in particular is among the best in the country and the sparkling wines have real freshness and finesse. South of Melbourne is the Mornington Peninsula with its rolling hills, orchards, olive groves, historic mansions, and more than 200 vineyards. Pinot noir and chardonnay are signature varieties of the region. New South Wales Established in the 1820s, the warm Hunter Valley lies north of Sydney and is the country’s oldest fine wine region. Savouring the rich complexity of a fine old-vine Hunter semillon, matured for 10, 15 or more years in bottle, is a great white wine experience like no other. Fine Australian wines perfectly complement cultural events and gourmet activities Tasmania The surge of interest in cooler climate wines has put Tasmania firmly in the spotlight in recent years. Its star turns are riveting, traditional method sparkling wines and sauvignon blancs with uniquely delicious regional character. Explore the island’s beautiful northern and eastern coastlines, peppered with wineries offering guided tours, beautiful cellar door eateries and the perfect setting for tastings.
