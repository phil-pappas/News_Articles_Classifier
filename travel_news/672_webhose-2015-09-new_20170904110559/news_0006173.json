Tristram’s oak staircase spirals up three floors, creating a vast central space with opulent bedrooms, impressive bathrooms and chic living areas. Enviable and expensive, this seaside play palace is only occasionally humbled by the gales that whip off the Atlantic. Sleeps 12-14 in six bedrooms, five of which have ensuite bathrooms. Location: 10/10 Tristram House, New Polzeath: take in the view from bed The house is a stone’s throw from the beach, separated only by a cul-de-sac and a grassy cliff. The Victorian terrace in which it squats is constantly changing as developers move in. A short walk takes you to the village’s surf shops, cafes and pasty bars. The coastal path continues to the family beach at Daymer, following the Camel estuary to the sailing centre of Rock. Eastwards, the path offers the finest stretches of Cornish coast, with regular sightings of seals and dolphins. Style & character: 7/10 Tristram House is designed for holidaying in style. Plain white walls sport bold paintings; the ubiquitous cows of Cornish artist Caroline Walker dominate. The huge open-plan ground floor offers plenty of window seating, vast sofas and a grand dining room table complete with pink silk orchids. Movie watchers can snuggle on leather sofas in the snug while the more sociable can steal away to the upstairs sitting room, which has even better views of the bay. Bedrooms are large, white and bright, with coloured cushions and throws, each with a character of its own. Facilities: 6/10 The facilities in this generally sparkling house are mixed. The kitchen is surprisingly ill equipped. A two-door Aga is complemented by an electric oven, but a small single sink is surely an oversight. Limited amounts of cutlery, plates, glasses and mugs means a full house will be washing up a lot. Tristram House, New Polzeath: the kitchen has limited equipment for a house of this size For a house of this calibre, a games room is a surprising omission. Elsewhere, the house is luxurious: splendid bathrooms, dreamy bedrooms and a glamorous social space. It spills out onto a glorious terrace to the front and a large patio to the rear, complete with barbecue and sunbeds. The rear garden is less inviting, shaded beneath pine trees and serving as the house’s parking lot. Value for money: 6/10 Given the impressive inclusive concierge service and the size and quality of the house, it is good value. Tristram House costs from £3000 per week in low season, rising to £6,500 in high. Family-friendly: 8/10 The house is perfect for teenagers and fun-loving adults but less suitable for small children and toddlers. No dogs. Eating The tiny Spar in Polzeath sells caviar alongside freshly baked croissants and everyday favourites. The village has some reasonable cafes, but it is worth a short drive to the restaurants of the celebrity chefs in Port Isaac, Rock and Padstow. Access for guests with disabilities?
