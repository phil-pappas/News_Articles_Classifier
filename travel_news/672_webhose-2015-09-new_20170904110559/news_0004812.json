Detailed information comparing the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of diesel cars with gasoline cars will be the focus of a free webinar this Wednesday.\nGasoline vehicles currently dominate the U.S. market with more than a 90 percent share of cars and pickup trucks. This contrasts sharply with Europe where over 50 percent of passenger vehicles are diesels.\nThis webinar, sponsored by the Diesel Technology Forum , will feature the lead researcher in the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute new study that compares the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of diesel cars with gasoline cars. To determine the TCO for diesel and gasoline vehicles researchers compiled and compared data on a variety of expenses including depreciation, fuel costs, repairs, fees and taxes, insurance, and maintenance.\nThis free webinar is of interest to auto consumers, fleet managers, dealers, transportation officials, policymakers, researchers and the media.\nAccording to the report: \"There are dramatic changes taking place in the U.S. automotive industry as it moves to meet stringent government mandated Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) requirements. Clean diesel engine technology represents one of the technologies companies are using to improve fuel economy. This report not only compares the fuel efficiency of clean diesel vehicles to comparable gasoline versions of the same vehicle (sold at auction during the 2012-2013 timeframe), but it also compares the total cost of ownership (TCO) between the two types of technologies.\"\nDate: Wednesday, September 2 nd , Noon (ET)\nSpeaker: Bruce M. Belzowski Managing Director Automotive Futures,\nUniversity of Michigan Transportation Research Institute\nClick here to register.\nFor more information on the series go to http://www.dieselforum.org/about-the-forum/events\nThere is no cost for the webinar but space is limited.\nThis webinar is the first in a series of online web-based sessions on a range of topics including personal transportation choices, goods movement, rail and water transportation, emergency preparedness, agricultural productivity and efficiency, renewable fuels, construction efficiency and more.\nThe 60 minute interactive sessions include the presentation of new research, important insights and useful information on key policy issues including energy, environmental, climate, and economic choices in each of the topical areas.\nOther sessions in the Learning Series include:\nDiesel Cars Trucks and SUVs in the U.S.: Customer and Societal Benefits, Challenges and Opportunities ( September 23 rd ) Power Up: State Initiatives To Enhance Readiness And Resiliency For Ensuring Continuous Electrical Operation For Key Businesses And Facilities During Grid Outages Climate Change And Fuel Saving Impacts Of New Clean Diesel Technology In Commercial Trucks Full Throttle: Keeping the Goods Flowing and Boats and Barges Moving While Improving Efficiency and Reducing Emissions.
