This new alliance provides Club members with access to the award-winning wellness program, its skilled professional staff and serene and luxurious accommodations.\n“One of the best side effects of travel is that we get a mental break from everyday stresses and an opportunity for the brain to recharge,” says Cathy Ross, CEO. “Exclusive Resorts recognizes that healthy bodies are just as important as healthy minds, and our partnership with The Ranch is perfect for members looking for a week-long detox without sacrificing the service or benefits they have come to expect from Exclusive Resorts.”\nAs a result of this new partnership, Exclusive Resorts members will enjoy exclusive VIP perks when they book The Ranch at Live Oak Malibu’s existing weeklong weight loss, wellness and nutritional program. Members-only benefits include a custom welcome basket and choice of a complimentary acupuncture treatment, chiropractic treatment or pre- and post-program cholesterol test. The Ranch will also host a series of fitness and wellness weekends for Exclusive Resorts members in Club residences — the first planned for Spring 2016 in Vail, Colorado.\n“It is an honor to join the Exclusive Resorts portfolio of the world’s leading luxury travel destinations and like-minded hospitality brands. This partnership is a testament to Exclusive Resorts’ recognition of the growing consumer demand for wellness tourism, and The Ranch’s position as a leader within this sector,” says Alex Glasscock, founder of The Ranch at Live Oak Malibu. “We are thrilled to offer their members an unforgettable, transformative experience that mirrors the quality and service they expect from their traditional Exclusive Resorts getaways.”\nSource:- Exclusive Resorts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T18:24:28.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
