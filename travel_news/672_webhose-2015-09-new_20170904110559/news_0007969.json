It’s time to go somewhere unique, somewhere unseen, somewhere a world away where the people, the experiences and the memories gained will last a lifetime. \nSuzhou , located in southeastern China, is that place. Located in the center of the Yangtze River Delta, approximately 60 miles west of Shanghai, Suzhou is one of the oldest cities in the region, dating back more than 2,500 years. Today, Suzhou is one of the hottest travel destinations in China, offering plenty to see and do in a dynamic and beautiful setting \nNine of the world’s most beautiful gardens \nClassical Chinese garden design flourishes in Suzhou where nine of the city’s gardens have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Two of these gardens, Humble Administrator’s Garden and Lingering Garden, are considered the most famous gardens in all of China. Humble Administrator’s Garden is the nation’s largest garden, defined by its pristine collections of small forests and the gentle patter of the water feature that is the garden’s backdrop. Lingering Garden blends man-made construction and nature’s beauty into one scenic experience. Domiciles and temples come together with native trees and flowers that intertwine along with intricate wood carvings and a collection of rocks deliberately arranged in the garden by its original creators. \nThe world’s longest canal makes Suzhou the Venice of China \nOne of the best ways to enjoy the history and beauty of Suzhou’s landmarks and waterside gardens is relaxing in a boat. Suzhou’s narrow water passages are some of the oldest in the world and perfect for any traveler looking to take in the city’s original charm. Reach out and touch the plants in the garden of Mudu as you float by with the gentle backdrop noise of the boat’s soft paddle touching the water. Or, float beneath the famed bridges of the Wujiang District where newlyweds routinely cross in the hopes the tradition will bring them happiness, peace and fortune. \nOne of the world’s richest historical sites \nLocated adjacent to the Humble Administrator’s Garden is the Suzhou Museum, designed by world-renowned architect I.M. Pei, where guests are treated to a collection of ancient ceramics, wood carvings and other cultural artifacts illustrating the past. The city is also home to The Suzhou Silk Museum, which showcases Suzhou’s title as the silk capital of China and offers guests a historical look at the silk production of yesteryear that made the city famous. Visitors can experience the step-by-step silk-making process starting with the silk worm and moving on to thread and finished products. \nA festival for every occasion and food you won’t forget \nNo Suzhou travel experience is complete unless it includes attendance at one of the city’s numerous festivals, which take place across the city throughout the year. The Hanshan Temple Bell Ringing Festival, for example, takes place every year on Dec. 31. Thousands of people flock to the 1,500-year-old temple to hear the monks strike the bell 108 times which is said to bring good luck in the New Year. Meanwhile, the Spring Festival marks the Chinese New Year and is notorious for its amazing fireworks display and unforgettable parade. Festivals are also a remarkable time to enjoy Suzhou’s succulent cuisine. Watch the parade from a seat in a classic Suzhou Tea House or dine on Fengzhen noodles beneath the fireworks. The tastes and the memories are unforgettable. \nPlan your visit to Suzhou today \nWith the gardens, the canal, the history and the culture — there’s plenty to do in Suzhou and getting to the region has never been easier.
