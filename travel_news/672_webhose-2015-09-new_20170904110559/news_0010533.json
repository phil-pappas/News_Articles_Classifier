LOUIS (AP) â€” As work progresses on the project to renovate the Gateway Arch and the area surrounding it, the St. Louis organization Great Rivers Greenway is balking at a request for cash from the National Park Service .\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch ( http://bit.ly/1MbtBAE ) reports that Park Service officials had given their greenlight on the $380 million renovation project of the Gateway Arch grounds so long as local officials agreed that taxpayers and private donors would fund nearly all of the work, plus the operations increase.\nPark Service officials had asked the Great Rivers Greenway for its first major installment of ongoing operations cash. The Park Service wanted $356,000 next year, largely to help pay for three park rangers. But the public trails district balked at the request Tuesday and instead questioned Park Service officials about the funding.\n___\nInformation from: St. Louis Post-Dispatch, http://www.stltoday.com", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://bit.ly/1MbtBAE", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T21:26:33.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
