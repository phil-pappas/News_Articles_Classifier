Together with Hannelore Kraft, Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia, and Dusseldorf's Lord Mayor, Thomas Geisel, he unveiled an Airbus A321 bearing the name \"airdüsseldorf\", in special recognition of his airline's commitment to Dusseldorf airport. The aircraft visually affirms airberlin's special relationship with the airport and visibly emphasises this close partnership, both on the ground and in the air. This aircraft is and will remain unique in the airberlin fleet and will of course continue to bear the airberlin colors. \nStefan Pichler: “Today's event is in recognition of Dusseldorf airport. We look forward to continuing our partnership and hope the airport does, too. The airport's commitment provides the necessary basis for us to actively develop our hub here, for which we also rely on the support of Lord Mayor Geisel. We would like to thank the region's Minister-President for her dedicated commitment to North Rhine-Westphalia as an aviation location.” \nMinister-President Hannelore Kraft: “We want to improve the competitiveness of the aviation sector in North Rhine-Westphalia whilst minimising pollution for the population and the environment as much as possible. This aeroplane is more efficient than its predecessors and represents exactly what we need to do to achieve this. I hope this investment will help airberlin be successful in the future. And for its employees, in particular, I hope that today marks the start of a new beginning.” \nAs Dusseldorf's largest long-haul carrier, airberlin provides almost half of all the available seats on all the airport's long-haul aircraft. A number of attractive long-haul services, to the US, United Arab Emirates and the Caribbean, for example, are connected via numerous feeder flights from throughout Germany, Austria and Switzerland, so that passengers can reach their destinations quickly and conveniently. \nTogether with its strategic partner, Etihad Airways, airberlin operates flights from Dusseldorf to Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Australia. Its close partnerships with Alitalia, Air Serbia and oneworld® partners (Iberia, British Airways, Finnair) supplement the wide range of destinations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T22:36:13.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
