Big Brothers Big Sisters has been building positive mentor relationships for kids across the country for more than 100 years so it was a natural partnership that developed through a shared vision.\"\n\"We are excited and grateful that Go Ape selected Big Brothers Big Sisters to participate in their inaugural National Live Life Adventurously Day.
