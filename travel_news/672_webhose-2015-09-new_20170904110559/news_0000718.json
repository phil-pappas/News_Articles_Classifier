Through joint efforts, the two countries have overcome difficulties and obstacles to maintain sound development toward mature and stable relations, according to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. During a meeting in London with Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond in June, Mr Wang said he expected the presidential visit to be a milestone, as his country was willing to respond to Britain’s willingness to create a “golden age” in relations. The China-Britain Business Council, an organisation that helps British companies expand into China, also had high expectations for Mr Xi’s visit. Chief executive Stephen Phillips said the visit would mark a “new high point” in relations and “an opportunity to deepen UK-China commercial ties” and do more business in British, Chinese and other markets. “At the CBBC, we think there is great potential for continued growth in the commercial links,” he added. Kerry Brown, an associate fellow at the London think tank Chatham House, echoed Mr Phillips and described Sino-British relations as “largely pragmatic and focused on … mutual selfinterest, mostly in terms of the UK being a destination for investment from China, for knowledge partnerships with universities here and for the importance of London as a fi nance centre”. China-UK relations should develop well as the two nations learn to deal with each other... The areas of interest between the two countries have been established and were widely understood, he said. “In many ways, Britain is the most pragmatic of China’s partners in Europe, as was shown in its willingness to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.” Chancellor George Osborne announced in March that Britain had applied to become a prospective founding member of the Asian bank, making the country the fi rst Western nation to do so. Mr Brown said the visit by the Chinese president would also bring “more information on the diversifi cation of investment into Britain and about technology partnerships”. Chinese investment created more than 6,000 jobs in Britain during the 2014-15 fiscal year, according to Jin Xu at the Chinese embassy’s economic and commercial offce. “With 112 projects in the UK this year, Chinese investment ranked fourth among all foreign countries,” making the country the top job creator among developing countries, he said. “Chinese companies have made a signifi cant contribution to the British economy through growth and employment.” Chinese investment in Britain reached more than £64 million in 2004 and since then has risen by a further £25 billion, according to Mr Jin. More than 500 Chinese companies have established offices in Britain, expanding into advanced manufacturing, infrastructure, fi nancial services, telecommunication, brand networking, and research and development. Mr Phillips said that during the October state visit discussions between the two countries “will no doubt include China’s Belt and Road Initiative, which will see new and exciting opportunities emerge both with China and beyond, with revitalised trade and investment links” through Central Asia and into Europe. “This is something we’re following closely,” he said, adding: “Made in China 2025, another important policy, aims to move China’s manufacturing up the value chain. This will open up further new areas of collaboration.” The China-Britain Business Council joined forces with Alibaba Group in August to launch a three-day sales promotion for 20 British brands on China’s largest online shopping platform. Rana Mitter, director of the University of Oxford China Centre, said: “China-UK relations are currently warm and should develop well as the two nations learn to deal with each other in a friendly and frank way.” This article was originally produced and published by China Daily . • Read more about Chinese current affairs at China Watch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T06:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T02:35:18.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
