However we appreciate that it will still cause disruption to passengers and I thank them for their cooperation and patience.\nâ€“ Mark Killick, Network Rail Last updated Sat 29 Aug 2015 Travel West Midlands", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T00:33:45.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
