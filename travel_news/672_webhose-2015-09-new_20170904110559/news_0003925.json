In addition to its wide range of advanced braking functionality, the technology can act as a so called 'black-box' integration hub – hosting software algorithms to control automated driving, safety, chassis and drivetrain functions.\nManfred Meyer , global vice president, ZF TRW Braking Engineering, said: \"The fitment of advanced safety and automated driving functions is demanding a whole new level of software integration within the vehicle. We need to consider clever ways in terms of where and how we host the increasing number of functions. Utilizing central 'processing hubs' – such as our ESC - is key and can help to reduce the amount of physical ECUs in the vehicle environment as well as simplify electronic architecture.\"\nZF TRW has developed its advanced six piston premium ESC technology (EBC 460) which now offers one of the most powerful microcontrollers in the automotive industry and can therefore host considerably more software. Launching later this year with a major European vehicle manufacturer, the ESC module will host the control algorithms for an advanced automated driving function. In addition, it provides the integration platform for enhanced chassis actuators for example the center clutch, rear axle steering, electric park brake and drivetrain – helping to achieve the maximum comfort and sophisticated control of all vehicle dynamics.\nMeyer continued: \"Our ESC provides a powerful execution platform for third party software components and algorithms with the most demanding safety integrity levels (ASIL-D) combined with the very latest industry software standard (Autosar). It can enable a wide range of enhanced vehicle functionality far beyond the scope of typical ESC systems. We are proud to have been part of such a highly complex project - the first of its kind for ZF TRW.\"\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150922/269219\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/electronic-stability-control-from-zf-trw-offers-advanced-software-integration-capabilities-300147030.html\n©2015 PR Newswire.
