The West Bromwich Albion veteran headed the visitors ahead after 12 minutes but Joan Edmundsson equalised prior to the break in Torshavn following an error from Leeds winger Stuart Dallas. Yet when Edmundsson was dismissed for two yellow cards after the hour, Michael O'Neill's side took full advantage - McAuley nodding in from another right-wing free-kick before Lafferty fired in a third. • Georgia 1 Scotland 0, match report With third-placed Hungary only drawing with previous leaders Romania, the Northern Irish moved to the top of Group F with three games remaining and victory over the Hungarians in Belfast on Monday would confirm their qualification for a major international tournament for the first time since the 1986 World Cup. The last time they played the Faroes Northern Ireland scored twice inside the opening 20 minutes and they started with similar intent as Chris Brunt smashed a shot over the bar and delivered a couple of inviting left-wing centres. It was a cross from the other flank that produced the opener 12 minutes in, though, when Gilli Sorensen's sliding tackle on Niall McGinn resulted in a free-kick and Oliver Norwood's set-piece was guided into the net by McAuley at the near post. • Roy Hodgson offends San Marino manager They should have quickly doubled their lead from another Norwood set-piece from the right, this time a corner that found McGinn whose stabbed effort fell just wide of the near post. Klye Lafferty is congratulated after scoring against the Faroe Islands Michael McGovern had remained untested at the other end but had to usher McAuley's sliced clearance wide after Solvi Vatnhamar's right-wing cross had kicked up off the turf and surprised the centre-back. The Faroes were beginning to dominate possession and they grabbed an equaliser with nine minutes to go before half-time. Jonas Tor Naes' long throws were a feature of the hosts' attack and when he launched one from the right, Dallas brought the ball back into a dangerous and the host's towering centre-back Sonni Nattestad was able to pull across for Joan Edmundsson to turn in first time. Northern Ireland could have entered the interval ahead, but Lafferty's free header from McGinn's right-wing cross looped over with goalkeeper Nielsen flapping at air. The away side's hopes were raised just after the hour when Edmundsson, who had earlier been booked for clattering Norwood early on, went straight through the midfielder again to leave his team a man short. Six minutes after that dismissal Northern Ireland went back ahead and it was McAuley's head that provided the finishing touch once more. The lively McGinn was shoved to the deck by Sorensen and Brunt's inswinging free-kick reached McAuley after he jostled to position himself ahead of Odmar Faero to head home again. Lafferty then got in the act with 15 minutes to go to enhance the visitors' lead when he shrugged off Nattestad and rifled in a shot. Substitute Josh Magennis struck the post late on but O'Neill's men did enough to go top of Group F with three games left and have given themselves the opportunity to celebrate qualification in Belfast with victory on Monday.
