Organised by the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB), Sun Hung Kai Properties Hong Kong Cyclothon will consist of cycling races and a range of fringe activities such as a street carnival. \n\nPeter Lam, chairman of HKTB, hopes to expand the scale of the event so that it becomes a major annual event in the Pearl River Delta region after the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge is completed. \n\nHowever, operators such as Tomco Incentive & Travel Service find the notion a hard sell. Said Kevin Leung, the company's marketing director: “To be honest, cycling is an uncommon sport and it is difficult to promote. Consultants specialising in sports may sell it but we may not.\" \n\nWing Wong, managing director at W Travel, agreed: ”It’s a very small and niche market that we don’t (sell). Compared to neighbouring destinations like Taiwan, Hong Kong is a bit behind in developing this segment. The city is equipped with nice bicycle tracks but no one promotes it.” \n\nPaul Etherington, owner of Kayak and Hike, offered a more pragmatic view: “I don't think people will come to Hong Kong to go cycling like Europe and New Zealand, but if Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan can organise good cycling events then Hong Kong should be able to as well.” \n\nOthers like Tim Obendorf, director of International Cyclists to Asia, are more sanguine. “This event will serve to put cycling in Hong Kong on the radar...and (stir up) curiosity in many tourists to ask the question, ‘Cycling in Hong Kong? Really?’”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T12:09:26.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
