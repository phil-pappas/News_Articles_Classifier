She’s now in her penultimate year of an MEng in civil engineering at Liverpool John Moores University There’s no two ways about it – entering the STEM Awards changed my life. It’s given me the chance to do things I’d never in my wildest dreams have imagined I’d be doing at 21. The past few months have been unbelievable: I feel like the idea I submitted is really going somewhere, and I’ve been meeting the most incredible people. Everyone involved in the competition has gone out of their way to boost my confidence. During my industrial placement I’d become aware of a workplace-safety issue that didn’t sit right with me. That was what made me want to put my idea forwards for the Awards. I decided that if I wanted to change the industry, I needed to start somewhere – and the competition seemed like a perfect opportunity to do that. My win proves that civil engineering really isn’t just a career for men – and that your gender should never hold you back from going after the job you want. Still, I never thought I get as far as I did. So if I can do it, what are you waiting for? The STEM Awards have completely changed the trajectory of my career Mark Goudie , 23, was 2015’s Energy category winner – his solution, WERS (Wind Energy Reservoir Storage), is currently in development with Atkins, for whom he’s now working full time The STEM Awards gives you with the chance to solve problems that you’ve never considered before, and provides you with a platform for promoting your solution. After winning the Energy category, sponsored by Semta, I was blown away by the world of opportunities that the competition provided. It has completely changed the trajectory of my engineering career. I’ve since joined a newly established team called Future Energies in Atkins, which is one of the leading design and consultancy organisations in the energy sector. I’ll be working on developing and implementing the new technologies and techniques that will help bring sustainable electricity to people across the globe, with WERS being one of my projects. If you’re thinking about applying my advice would be to consider the different categories carefully, spend time developing and testing your ideas, and then go for it. You’ve got nothing to lose, and it might open doors you never knew existed. STEM Awards 2016 Change your future.
