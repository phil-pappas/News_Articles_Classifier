Townsville locals can continue to a host of international destinations from Bali such as Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Cambodia and Thailand through Jetstar’s Singapore hub.\n“We encourage the community to support the new service and take advantage of the great fares on offer.”\nMr Hall added that its Townsville-Bali flights wouldn’t have been viable without strong commitment to a cost-effective customs solution at the airport.\n“Full credit to local MP Ewen Jones and Kevin Gill from Townsville Airport for the part they’ve played in making these flights possible,” Mr Hall said.\n“It’s always a big undertaking to launch a new international route and their support has been vital in making this a reality.”\nWith the addition of the Bali-Townsville flights, Jetstar now offers more than 11,000 seats in and out of Townsville Airport each week.\nFlights depart from Townsville on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays at 22:55 and arrive in Bali at 01:30 the following day. Return services will depart Bali at 02:30 on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays, and arrive same day in Townsville at 09:15.\nJetstar offers up to 50 return flights to Bali from Australia each week – more than any other airline.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:05:49.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
