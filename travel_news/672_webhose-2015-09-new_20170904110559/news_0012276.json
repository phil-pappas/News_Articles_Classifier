And as the streets increase in pedestrian activity, Hankook Tire asked Americans just how well they follow the speed limit, especially in school zones.\nIn its latest Quarterly Gauge Index, Hankook found that, when it comes to the speed limit:\nThirty-four percent (34%) of Americans typically drive over the speed limit in a school zone. Twenty-three percent (23%) said they typically go three miles per hour or more over the required limit. Thirty-seven percent (37%) of drivers say they always follow the speed limit. Sixty-one percent (61%) of those that exceed the limit typically drive between two and five miles per hour over what is required, as the remaining thirty-nine percent (39%) are really putting the pedal to the metal going at least six miles per hour over. \"Our quarterly Hankook Gauge Index continually provides valuable and unique insights into Americans' driving behaviors,\" said Henry Kopacz , Public Relations and Social Media Manager, Hankook Tire America Corp. \"These recent results give us an interesting perspective on how careful and responsible Americans are when driving, especially in those we have to be extra wary of.\"\nThe Hankook Tire Gauge Index is a quarterly survey of Americans that uncovers their attitudes and opinions about all things related to driving.
