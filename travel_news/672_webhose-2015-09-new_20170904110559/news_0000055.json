Rooms at high-rise, beachfront hotels can easily cost $300 or more a night. A twenty may not cover a cheeseburger and fries — and that’s without a beverage. While sipping $14 mai tais, some visitors might ask: Are we really in paradise?\n“Honolulu is like any other big city with a beach as far as I’m concerned,” said Alan Bank, a Florida physician. While he and his family will be returning to Oahu next month, they’ll be heading to the far less touristy North Shore. This laid-back, tropical oasis is about 40 miles — and 50 years — from Waikiki.\nA North Shore vacation can be an adventure, and it needn’t put as big a dent in the wallet. While a five-day car rental often tops $250, a bus ride from Honolulu to anywhere on the island costs $2.50. While traveling by bus isn’t for everyone, it provides unique opportunities to interact with islanders.\nSuch adventurers will first want to check into one of the North Shore’s two hotels. Rooms at the new Courtyard by Marriott North Shore, in Laie, start at about $220. The blissfully isolated Turtle Bay Resort has rooms from about $300. Both are on the bus line.\nOnce settled in, the bus makes sightseeing hassle-free.\nThe village of Haleiwa attracts world-class surfers to its beautiful beaches, including the famous Banzai Pipeline. After time in the sun, cool off with the Hawaiian version of a snow cone at Matsumoto’s Shave Ice, where the syrups are available in 30-some flavors including banana, coconut and passion fruit.\nDay-trippers from Waikiki flock to the Polynesian Cultural Center in Laie. In native villages, guests learn about Hawaiian culture and that of other Pacific islands such as Fiji, Samoa and Tonga.\nFarther south at Kualoa Ranch, visitors explore the working cattle ranch where scenes from this summer’s Jurassic World were filmed. Tours are offered in old school buses and atop ATVs and horses.\nThis eastern, windward side of the island boasts a wealth of largely uncrowded beaches where locals come to surf and sun.\nSeveral food trucks dot the Kamehameha Highway, the two-lane road circling Oahu. But for a hearty, inexpensive meal, head to Tita’s Grill in Kahuku. Day and night, people line up to order Da Killah Moco. The massive meal — it must weigh a couple of pounds — includes three eggs, Portuguese sausage, Spam, macaroni salad and giant hamburger patties handmade by owner Junior Ah You. Slathered in gravy and served over rice, it’s easily enough food for two and costs just $12.50.\nA former college and pro football player, Ah You far prefers the rural North Shore lifestyle to that of Honolulu.\n“It’s pretty much a country-style way of living,” he says. “Kids still climb trees and eat breadfruit and green bananas.”\nJay Jones is a freelance writer in Las Vegas.\nWhen you go Routes 52 and 55 — the Circle Isle buses — begin and end their journeys at Ala Moana Center, a huge mall near Waikiki. Large suitcases aren’t allowed. A carry-on bag of the same dimensions allowed by Southwest Airlines is fine, as long as it fits on your lap or under the seat in front of you. A four-day pass for unlimited travel costs $35. Details are available online (thebus.org) or by calling 808-848-5555.
