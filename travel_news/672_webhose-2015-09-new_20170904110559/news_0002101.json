The North African country, where tourism accounts for around seven per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP), has been under a state of emergency since the shootings, when 38 people, including 30 Britons, were killed by a gunman at a hotel in Sousse in June, just three months after 21 tourists were attacked by gunmen at the Bardo National Museum in the capital city of Tunis.

The Foreign Office has advised against all but essential travel to Tunisia amid fears it is “highly likely” Britons will be targeted in a fresh terror attack.

The tour operators TUI and Thomas Cook have cancelled their Tunisia programmes from Britain until next year, while tour operators across Europe have shifted some of their routes to destinations including Spain. Some hotels have closed while foreign tour groups have cancelled some routes, cruises and packages. The Spanish hotel group RIU, which is a part of TUI, said it was reviewing its presence in Tunisia.

Tunisia has reduced its economic growth forecast to 0.5 per cent for this year, down from its initially anticipated three per cent. Mr Loumi hopes Tunisia can take advantage of the country’s current difficult period to work on reform, including diversifying the country’s tourism options.
