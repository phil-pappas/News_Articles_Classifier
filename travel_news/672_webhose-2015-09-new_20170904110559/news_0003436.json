For this upcoming long holiday, however, data from Hotels.com reveals that many Hongkongers also consider staycation a very attractive option. Hong Kong is the highest ranked destinations on the list of most popular destinations for Hongkongers, and searches by locals on the availability of Hong Kong hotel rooms for the upcoming holiday period have skyrocketed (up by 75 per cent) as compared to the same period in 2014. \nOther usual Hongkonger favourites such as Taipei, Tokyo, Osaka, Bangkok and Seoul have all seen a huge increase in search rate this period. \nAccording to the HPI, eight out of 10 destinations on the top search travel destinations list saw a decrease in prices paid per night by Hong Kong travellers in the first half of 2015. Hong Kong takes the lead as the city with the largest percentage drop (down 21 per cent) in the analysed period. If the prices paid per night by Hongkongers in local hotels continue to slip, spending day-offs for a staycation in this dynamic city may become an even more popular option in the years to come. \nPlease find below a list of hotel recommendations presented to you by Hotels.com for your amazing staycation in Hong Kong.
