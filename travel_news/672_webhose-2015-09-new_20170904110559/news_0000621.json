These tickets will allow you to bypass the line through a designated, pre-paid entrance. However, it's important to note that the system requires you to choose a specific date and one-hour time slot for your visit. Your tickets will only be good for entry on that date, at that time. There is also an added booking fee of 50 eurocents. Note About Pre-Paid Tickets: While I find the online booking system somewhat restrictive, it does serve a purpose -- the museum implemented it to regulate crowds. It's still wise to buy these pre-paid tickets, to avoid the on-site box-office line that grows around the building. You do run the risk of missing your window if your plans change (and thus losing money) -- but (and you didn't hear this from me), some friends of mine recently sold their pre-paid tickets for face value to a couple in the line when they suddenly had to change their travel plans. When to Go: If you don't buy pre-paid tickets, the least crowded times of day to go are early in morning or toward the end of opening hours (remember you'll need about an hour to get through the house). \nShops & Restaurants: \nThe on-site museum shop, accessible only for paid visitors, sells dozens of publications on Anne Frank, as well as copies of \"The Diary of Anne Frank\" in several languages. \nThe (in-house) museum café serves drinks, snacks and simple lunch options like soup and rolls.
