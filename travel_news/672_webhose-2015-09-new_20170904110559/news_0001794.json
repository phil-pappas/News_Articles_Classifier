Here's a taster. \nMany people visiting Prague do so to explore the culture, art and history. Others, however, come specifically to enjoy the fabulous cuisine if the city. But even if food is not your main focus while in Prague, eating as the locals can be a very rewarding part of your trip. \nGetting There \nIf you're arriving via Prague airport, transfers into the city are quick, efficient and easy to book. Prague airport transfers can be organised privately or on a shared basis and they make getting into the city a pleasant and relaxing experience. Before you know it you'll be out and about soaking up the sights and sampling the delicious cuisine. \nA Brief Look at Czech Cuisine \nA fabulous combination of German and Hungarian goulashes, schnitzels and strudels, Czech cuisine also boasts many interesting elements of its own. Main course options usually include the three national foods: vepro, which is pork; knedlo, which are dumplings; and zelo, which is cabbage. The pork is usually lightly seasoned and baked, smoked or breaded and fried. The dumplings can come one of two ways: either light and spongy or dense and thicker. And while you may think that the cabbage might be prepared like the German sauerkraut, you would be wrong. Czech cabbage is boiled and served with a delicately flavoured sugar sauce – delicious. While every restaurant has its own take on the three staple main courses, they are the standard Czech dishes that really must be sampled. \nRostene and uzeniny, are spicy cured meats, which are also popular additions on any menu, while cmunda, is a dish made of a steaming potato pancake topped with Moravian pork and boiled sweetened red cabbage. Main courses are often served with sauces that may at first appear heavy and bland, but when served with spicy meats and tangy cabbage come deliciously alive. \nAnd to Drink… \nWashing your food down with the local brew is par for the course in Prague, and the Czech Republic has a steadfast tradition of producing excellent beer. Pilsner Urquell and Staropramen originated here and Czech beer is nothing like the beers of Western Europe and America. Lager is the mainstay but a few breweries make ales too. When choosing a lager at one of the city's hundreds of pubs, make sure you order a 10 degree light lager if you want something with a lower percentage of alcohol, or the 11 or 12 degree larger if you fancy something a little stronger. \nWhen you're travelling into the city on Prague airport transfers, it's also a great idea to ask your driver for any suggestions for where to eat and what to sample. Local knowledge is a priceless gift when travelling, so make the most of the journey on the Prague airport transfers to your accommodation.   \nLukas Johannes is a driver for Shuttle Direct.
