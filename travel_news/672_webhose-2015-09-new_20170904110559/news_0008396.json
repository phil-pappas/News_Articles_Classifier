But as we got older we started yearning for that extra bit of home comfort: a fixed bed already made up; a fridge with cool milk (or beer); a warm place to sleep and eat. So last year we ordered a cute little Airstream Eriba 310GT caravan. Its small size not only makes it really easy to tow and set up, it’s created more of a challenge. My mother-in-law never believed we’d all fit, but it’s become my great hobby – to get everything we need for a fortnight’s adventure or a spur-of-the-moment mini-trip into this tiny living pod. We had a retro-looking awning made that takes two minutes to put up and looks great. If the children come with us they stay in a couple of side tents and we use the Eriba and awning as a base. What could be better than arriving at an idyllic spot and setting up in time to enjoy the early evening sun with some good food and a nice glass of red wine, and knowing that all your home comforts are just behind you? Getting ready for a trip is easy: stock up the fridge, make up the bed, stick some spare clothes in the wardrobe and you’re off on an adventure We generally go away with some friends, another family of five. Cornwall and Devon are our favourites. With the tent we spent five days on a clifftop near Weymouth watching the Olympic sailing events and then went on to St Austell in Cornwall. Each time it’s a new adventure, and when we meet up in the winter the conversation tends to revolve around what happened on the summer camping trip. The Eriba is a combination of all the things I like in camping. Because of its small size it means our daily life on holiday is outside with the family. We tend to cook outside; it’s just more mellow, cooking and chatting. We’ve done a full roast chicken with all the veg; apple crumble and fresh custard; skewers of meat with peppers and mushrooms; amazing stir fries with egg fried rice – It’s definitely not cold baked beans straight from the tin. Getting ready for a trip is easy: stock up the fridge, make up the bed, stick some spare clothes in the wardrobe and you’re off on an adventure. When we arrive it takes 10 minutes to set up, get the cooker going and start relaxing. Not just for keeping warm: campfires are a highlight of camping and caravanning My favourite innovation is our “pop-up” bathroom. This is a small shower tent which I’ve rigged up with all the conveniences of our bathroom at home. We’ve got hot water, a shower, wash stand, mirror and the piece de resistance, a Kampa King Kazi (yes, it’s exactly what it sounds like). So we could be in the middle of the New Forest or Glastonbury Festival and still have a long hot shower and that rarest of camping pleasures, our own loo. I’m always refining the set up and equipment for the next big mission. I’ve just started making a “chuck box”, a wooden box that opens to form a portable camp kitchen. I’m a creative person so I’m fascinated by how to make it as simple as possible, but really well thought out and beautiful, too. Evenings are spent around our portable fire pit, which we stock up with any wood we can find in the daytime. We sit round with friends and a drink chatting about the events of the day. As the embers die down the kids often toast a marshmallow or two as a treat. The story and yarns can roll on all night. Heaven!
