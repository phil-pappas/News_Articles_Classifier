Based on the story by celebrated Danish author Hans Christian Andersen, the ballet was created by Danish-born Kenneth Greve, Artistic Director of the FNB. The music is by Finnish composer Tuomas Kantelinen, known for his film scores. Greve and Kantelinen previously collaborated on the hugely successful ballet The Snow Queen, premiered in 2012 – also a setting of a story by Andersen. In The Little Mermaid, Kenneth Greve weaves the story and Andersen’s life together. Andersen is known to have admired dancers for their sensitivity and grace but was unable to pursue a career as a dancer himself because of his deformed body. Andersen and the little mermaid both aspire to the impossible: she wants to have legs, and Andersen wants to dance. The underwater world in the production is created with the aid of 3D technology. The sets are by takis, the costumes by Erika Turunen, the lighting by Kalle Ropponen, the projections by Jouka Valkama and the makeup by Virpi Ketko. The conductor at the premiere will be Robert Reimer. The FNB’s season will continue with the revival of The Nutcracker and the Mouse King by Wayne Eagling and Toer van Schayk and La Bayadère by Natalia Makarova.
