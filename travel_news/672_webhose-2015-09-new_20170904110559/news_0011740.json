That's the core idea behind two new commercials from Autotrader, the most-visited car shopping site. The new spots reflect a shift in how Millennials relate to brands and the car shopping process. According to Autotrader research, Millennials spend an average of 17 hours shopping for a vehicle, with much of that time spent online researching their intended purchase.\n\"How consumers discover a product is becoming just as important as the product itself,\" said John Kovac , senior vice president of Marketing for Cox Automotive which owns Autotrader. \"While these new commercials embody that principle, that mindset is at the core of our brand and is transforming the way we do business. We believe you can love the experience of searching for your perfect car just as much as finding it.\"\nThe first new spot – \"The Journey\" – follows the mishaps a young man encounters when courting what turns out to be his future wife. The second spot – \" One Search \" tells the story of a young woman who decides to leave the security of her small hometown to find new career opportunities in the city. Autotrader features like saved searches, text alerts and search filtering are naturally woven into each spot as the characters discover cars to suit the new stages in their lives.\n\"Cars are more than just things to us, they represent moments and memories,\" said Josh DiMarcantonio , executive creative director at Zambezi, the creative agency who developed the spots. \"We were inspired to show that in these commercials -- they're characters in those crossroads of our lives.\"\nAccording to Autotrader's Millennial Study, Millennials are more likely than older generations to purchase a new car due to a change in lifestyle. The study also shows Millennials who have experienced life events including getting married, buying a home and becoming parents are more likely to own a car than those who haven't.\n\"While the commercials portray Millennials, car shoppers of all ages can relate these stories to unique milestones in their own lives,\" said Jessica Stafford , vice president of consumer marketing for Autotrader. \"Whether you're searching for your first car or your fifth, Autotrader is there as a matchmaker to make the journey easier and more fun.\"\n\"The Journey\" will make its debut Sept. 5 during the CBS SEC Pre-Game show: \"Autotrader College Football Today.\" \" One Search \" will launch on Oct. 1 .
