The area has started to experience signs of red tide, an algae bloom that can cause fish kills, discolored beach waters, and also poses health risks to humans. The University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley Coastal Studies Lab is monitoring the deteriorating conditions and performing hand counts of algae cells from samples taken around the area’s waters.

Tuggle says the cleanup usually draws about 10,000 volunteers, but the numbers were lower this year due to nine fewer sites than usual.\nRed tide involves a toxin that can cause shellfish poisoning in humans who consume it. Aerosols produced by red tide can cause breathing trouble.\nScattered fish kills have been reported since red tide surfaced in Texas this month.\n___\nOnline:\nhttp://www.glo.texas.gov/adopt-a-beach/cleanups/locations.html\nhttps://tpwd.texas.gov/landwater/water/environconcerns/hab/redtide/status.phtml\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show the spokeswoman's first name is spelled Renee, not Renne.\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T16:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T02:44:17.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
