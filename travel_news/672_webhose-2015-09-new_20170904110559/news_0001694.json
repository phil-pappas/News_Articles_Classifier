Do you spend hours counting sheep, pigs, even cows in the hope that some imaginary leaping animal might lull you into a deep slumber - only to wake what seems like minutes later to the shrill sound of the alarm clock dreading work? Yes, we’ve all had the odd sleepless night . But when the odd night becomes a couple, or worse, a regular occurrence, the reason may not be what you think it is. Photo: Alamy Most people assume that if they aren’t sleeping well they must be suffering from stress or mild depression . Others put it down to side effects from prescription medication, or drinking too much alcohol or caffeine. Some people disturb themselves with their own snoring or may even suffer from sleep apnoea and be unaware. Once all of those possibilities have been ruled out however, the only other likely culprit is an out-of-date mattress that provides inadequate support. Yet few of us ever think about the state of our pillow, or rather, whether using the wrong one could be preventing us from falling into a deep, rejuvenating sleep. In actual fact, buying the right cushioning for your upper body and positioning it correctly is one of the most important parts of sleeping success. It is a very comforting feeling to have just the right height and softness beneath you to rest an achy, tired, over-thinking head on. Photo: Alamy The correct pillow can also help align the spine as you sleep, alleviating or preventing many common back and neck conditions . According to experts though, not only is the elevation and firmness of your head support important, so is matching the right type of pillow to your sleeping style. If you tend to snooze on your back for example you need a slim pillow which puts the spine in the mid-line position. If you sleep on your side - which 75 per cent of us do – the width is just as important as the height as it determines whether the cushioning falls into the gap between your shoulder and your neck. And if you suffer from hip pain or are pregnant as well as being a side-sleeper, you may need full body support, therefore a long pillow you can rest one leg and an arm on. Photo: Alamy \"People underestimate just how much of a difference having the right pillow makes, not only to the quality of their sleep but also to how they feel throughout the day,\" says physiotherapist Sammy Margo. \"I have seen so many patients throughout my 26-year career suffering from neck, shoulder, back and hip pain, not to mention pins and needles in their arms and postural problems, simply because of how they sleep. We give a lot of thought to how we sit and stand these days but very little thought to how we lie down at night.\" Margo has spent years researching good and bad sleeping habits. In 2008 she wrote the book The Good Sleep Guide and has now used her knowledge to develop a range of pillows tailor-made to cater for everyone’s slumber style. Most people assume that if they aren’t sleeping well they must be suffering from stress or mild depression \"We spend a third of our lives asleep which is a lot of time. Not all of us sleep in the same way or in the same position,\" she explains, \"yet the pillows you buy in shops don’t account for this. I wanted to design a range that would literally help anyone get a better quality, deeper sleep and wake up feeling refreshed and re-energised.\" Margo has designed nine different types of Good Sleep Expert pillows , including one for pregnant women called the Bolster, which is triple the length of a normal pillow and helps take the weight of the baby bump off the spine by providing side support. There is also one for snorers called the Big Pillow which is overfilled to allow the upper airways to open up and relax. The range comes with a series of online videos too for further guidance.

From a test to determine whether your pillow is too old and information on the benefits of various sleep positions, to creating the perfect room temperature and how to eat and drink to ensure you get a restful snooze, most topics are covered. Over 20 million British adults suffer from sleep problems at some stage in their lives. Of these, insomnia is the most common, and becomes especially frustrating for sufferers during the long, winter nights that are now drawing in. So perhaps it might be worth looking at what’s under your head instead, the next time you find yourself mentally counting sheep in the early hours? @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T09:32:38.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
