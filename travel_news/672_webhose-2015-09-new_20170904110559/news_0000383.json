On an exclusive conversation with Travel And Tour World, he shared his insights about the role of education in MICE industry.\n“As Asia looks to the future of its meetings and convention business, a big factor will be the ability to successfully anticipate and address the rapidly changing expectations of event organizers. For some organizers, when the regions are relatively new for experiences –the primary concerns will be how to take best advantage of the destination opportunities while at the same time ensuring they get exactly what they need to deliver a successful event.\nThe answer to this challenge has two parts. The first is to know what exactly AIPC must do to meet their expectations, and the second is to communicate this knowledge successfully to those potential clients who may be wondering what to expect.\nIn some respects, the latter is the easiest. AIPC has an effective array of tools in our sales and marketing programs– many delivered via the educational exchanges that organizations like AIPC, the International Association of Convention Centres, have maintained over the years. That being the case, it is the practical knowledge of what it takes to deliver on client expectations that matters the most – and education is the answer.\nThat’s why as AIPC Vice President I have encouraged the establishment of the AIPC Asia Summit, which will take place in Singapore this October 22 in cooperation with the Singapore Association of Convention & Exhibition Organizers & Suppliers (SACEOS). The full day program will not simply engage convention centre professionals in tactical discussions around key topics such as market conditions, facility standards and global competition, but actually deliver critical insights into current client priorities by involving them directly in the discussions.\nTo succeed, an event like this needs good regional partnerships, and that is why we have made the relationship with SCAEOS a cornerstone of our plans. Says Weemin Ong, CMP, Chair – Education & Professional Development, SACEOS: “SACEOS is proud to partner with AIPC on what will be the first ever industry education program targeted at convention centre professionals in Asia, as they can deliver industry-relevant knowledge that will communicate key trends and issues relevant to convention centre professionals”.\nAIPC is deepening its commitment to centre excellence through education, networking and advocacy programmes that harness the collective wisdom and expertise of the world’s convention centres to enhance the value these facilities have in their respective cities and communities. I am excited to be playing a role in shaping these efforts, and particularly when it means enhanced business opportunities for our region.\nAIPC represents a global network of 175 leading centres in 58 countries with the active involvement of more than 900 management-level professionals worldwide. It is committed to encouraging and recognizing excellence in convention centre management, based on the diverse experience and expertise of its international representation, and maintains a variety of educational, research, networking and standards programs to achieve this. AIPC also celebrates and promotes the essential role of the international meetings industry in supporting economic, academic and professional development and enhancing global relations amongst highly diverse business and cultural interests.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T13:10:22.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
