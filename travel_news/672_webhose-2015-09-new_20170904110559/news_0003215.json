The attraction draws visitors from around the world interested in finding out more about the sanitation system of a great city. In this July 1, 2015 photo, a picture on display at the Paris Sewer Museum depicts the scene in Victor Hugo's classic novel, \"Les Miserables,\" in which Jean Valjean rescues Marius by carrying him through the sewers. Hugo, who describes the sewer system in detail in his book, referred to the sewers as \"that wonderful underground city.\" This photo taken July 1, 2015, a bust of Eugene Belgrand, the engineer who led the modernization of the Paris sewers gleams brightly in a gallery at the Paris Sewer Museum. The attraction draws visitors from around the world. \nPARIS — Forget Versailles, the Eiffel Tower and French fashion. When I want to be impressed by a marvel of Parisian design I head to the Musée des Égouts , aka the Sewer Museum. \nSure, not everyone gets the appeal of the city’s subterranean spectacle. \nBut, as tour guide Jean-Charles Pintori put it, “They are wrong!” \nI happened to stop by the museum on a summer day when temperatures soared over 38 degrees, and I wondered if the gritty reality of Paris’ underbelly might be a little overpowering. \nIn fact, it was one of the best places to be as Paris sizzled. Tucked deep underground, the museum maintains an even temperature, and the ambiance, while a little smelly in parts, is not overwhelming. In some areas, the air is quite fresh and with the artfully lit galleries and exhibits, you almost wouldn’t know where you were. \nAlmost. \nWalking past a canal, its dark surface prettily reflecting the glow of tunnel lights, I saw tiny bubbles popping on the surface, creating an effervescent sparkle. They turned out to be escaping methane gas. \nExhibits trace the history of Parisian sewage from the Middle Ages, when streets had drains for wastewater in the middle, to the current incarnation, which got a major overhaul in the mid-19th century under the supervision of city planner extraordinaire Baron Haussmann and engineer Eugene Belgrand. \nThe current system is unusual in that it also includes conduits for drinking water, handles rain runoff and houses telecommunications cables. \nDisplays of equipment, some antique, some current, show the tools used to keep the tunnels clear – workers remove about 15,000 cubic meters of solid waste per year. \nIt’s a tough job. Still, there are some families who have worked in the sewers for generations and are proud of their public service. Most are men but there are about a half-dozen women. \nWriter Victor Hugo called the sewers “that wonderful underground city” and used them as the setting for Jean Valjean’s dramatic rescue of Marius in “Les Miserables.” You’ll find a picture of the rescue in a corner of the museum along with a map showing the sewers as they were at the time the novel is set. \nPeople aren’t the only creatures travelling these tunnels, as a glass case full of stuffed rats indicates. We paused at a storm drain to see if we could spot one on my tour. I am happy to report that we didn’t. \nA display of antique swords caught my eye. Apparently at some point, someone somewhere tossed them and into the gutters they went. \nAs Pintori pointed out, the sewers are “the intestines of Paris. Everything comes through here.” \nModern-day Parisians are more likely to lose keys than fencing foils down storm drains. If that happens, there’s a number you can call to ask a worker to go look for your lost possessions. Officials report they perform anywhere up to 3,000 such operations per year with an 80 per cent success rate. \nLike all good museum tours, this one ends at the gift shop where you can buy mementoes of your visit including stuffed (toy) rats. \nUnlike most museum tours, departing visitors are admonished to wash their hands, to ensure they leave with nothing but memories. \nIF YOU GO \nMusée des Égouts : The sewer museum of Paris is near the Pont d’Alma and opposite 93 Quai d’Orsay. \nOpen Saturday-Wednesday, 11 a.m.-4 p.m. (until 6 p.m. through Sept. 30). Tickets are sold until one hour before closing. Admission: 4.40 euros (about $5). Guided tours are highly recommended but reservations are required.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T17:50:20.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
