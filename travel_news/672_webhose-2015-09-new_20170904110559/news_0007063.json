Apart from these, we also take a quick glimpse at more ‘tamed’ versions of denims that our filmy ladies have been sporting. Pick your favourite. \nThe signature slit: Want to do distressed without going all-out ragged? Take inspo from Anushka Sharma and DIY a pair of ankle-length denims, doing just a single slit. Add a pop of colour via your laced-up shoes and you’re good to go. \nThe cheesegrater rip: Out of the many techniques that are used to distress denims at home, there’s one that includes treating your denims with a cheesegrater to get a textured look. Kriti Sanon’s might be a store-bought pair but you can definitely be inspired. \nBowing to the knee slash: She doesn’t veer much from her ‘propah’ avatar, maybe that’s the reason we love it when Katrina Kaif does laidback chic. If not all-over ripped, take inspiration from this look and go for the always on-trend ripped knee. \nRed carpet distressed: We wouldn’t usually recommend denims for the red carpet, but we have to laud Sophie Choudry’s glam look. For a formal day out, you can too pick up distressed jeans and off-set the look with an embellished jacket and accessorise smart. \nThe other denim routes to take If rugged and ripped isn’t your fashion cuppa, here are two other ways to steer clear of a staple indigo pick. For a retro twist, do a flared bootcut like Twinkle Khanna or go for classic black denims like Aishwarya Rai Bachchan if formal pants are not your go-to picks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T12:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T18:21:19.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
