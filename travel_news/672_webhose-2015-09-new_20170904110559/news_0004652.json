Boathouse by Montara, located on Phuket’s Kata beach, provides enough activities and attractions to keep you from spending your entire getaway in your hotel room. The 26-year-old property, which underwent major renovations three years ago, includes the Boathouse Resort, Boathouse Wine & Grill and the Re Ka Ta Beach Club. Boathouse Resort \nFor accommod ation, the boutique resort divides its 38 rooms into eight types, from the smallest Superior Rooms to the ultimate Beachfront Penthouse Suite, more than four times the size of the Superior. But you don’t need 136m² of private space to feel like you’re on an important vacation with your companion. The mid-range Deluxe Beachfront, ranging from B5780++ to B8,500++ per night in Sep and Oct, is luxuriously spacious and five seconds away from the beach (four if you’re excited). The only features of the rooms that seemed to lag behind Boathouse’s shining four-star standards were amenities and cleanliness. The floors could have used a quick extra sweep before our arrival. \nRe Ka Ta Spa. \nQuiksilver Surf School at Re Ka Ta Beach Club. Boathouse Wine & Grill \nThe tourist’s habit of staying at a hotel and avoiding the hotel’s restaurant — except for the “complimentary” breakfast, that is — doesn’t apply at the Boathouse. Boathouse is known as the area hotel that people go to for food, regardless where they are staying. One of the reasons for the culinary popularity of Boathouse is its wine offerings, which has earned “two glasses”— a silver medal for wines — from Wine Spectator in the nine consecutive years since 2006. \nYou can enjoy wine tasting by the beach at the Boathouse Wine & Grill (B750++ for three glasses), daily, from 11am. Extend the experience to a steak dinner at the Wine & Grill and watch the sun go down and jazz music come alive. Sound romantic? Well, then it’s no wonder that one night during my stay a fellow guest popped the question to his girlfriend here. \nBoathouse Wine & Grill. Re Ka Ta Beach Club \nThe beach club is going to be your favourite part of Boathouse, especially if two words do it for you —“surf” and “spa”. The Quiksilver Surf School is part of the Re Ka Ta Beach Club, and is enjoyed by kids and adults alike. B1000 will get you a one-on-one lesson with national surf champion Jimmy Smith, plus an hour of free time on the waves. You can also ask the friendly staff to arrange other types of water sports, such as parasailing or jet-skiing, if you can’t get enough action. After an hour battling the sun, sand and sea, trust me, you’ll be needing that hour or so at the Re Ka Ta Spa, followed by teatime at the Re Ka Ta Cafe. \nRe Ka Ta Beach Club. Seasonal Specials \nUntil the end of Oct, Boathouse is offering the “Phuket Epic Adventure Package”, designed in collaboration with Lonely Planet and Quiksilver. We must admit, it is indeed epic. The package adds one thrilling local activity to a two-person, three-night stay for a discounted price. Your adventure options include learning to surf on Kata’s shoreline, zip-lining through Phuket’s tropical rainforests at high speeds and altitudes, and exploring the wonders of Phang Nga’s sea caves by canoe. The package starts at B4,675++ per night for a Superior Room. You also get 20 per cent off food and non-alcoholic beverages at the hotel. \nIf you’re sold on the adventure package or the idea of a spa retreat — or if you think you’ll be soiled with sand from surfing day in and out — just remember to pack your own sandals and toiletries (or get them from the Family Mart across the street). Then nothing will bother you from a relaxing yet activity-filled getaway at the Boathouse on Kata Beach. \nV Boathouse by Montara, 182 Koktanode Road, Kata Beach, Phuket.
