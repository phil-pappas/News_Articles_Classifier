An old hand at seeking out new, up-and-coming destinations and liaising with locals to source the best deals, he has never forgotten the thrill of discovering and exploring somewhere for the first time. That’s why, in his capacity as an expert Holiday Hunter for Saga Travel, he’s an intrepid explorer, a skilled negotiator and a wide-eyed tourist, all rolled into one. Affectionately known at Saga HQ as SDL, Stuart takes up the story: “There are lots of reasons why we start looking at a new hotel or region. I’ve been around the block a bit, and I know what I’m looking for, but often it’s a gut instinct about what our customers will love. “Crafting any one tour can take me up to a year, checking and checking again to make sure everything is just right, before we even start thinking about booking the first customers. “I’m particularly pleased with one of my latest creations – a fascinating overland adventure through Africa, taking in four countries – Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa. In fact, I’ve just returned from one last recce out there and as ever, I have a few stories to tell. Hard tuskmaster: an elephant faces down a prowling lioness “I expect most people are pretty confident that if they take a safari in Africa, they’ll glimpse a lion slinking through the long grass or spot a herd of elephants in the distance, but what they might not realise is just how close the animals are happy to let you get. “One night I arrived at a lodge in Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe, and as I walked into the lounge, I could just make out a huge number of elephants outside in the darkness. Extraordinarily, some were drinking from the little swimming pool just a few feet away. It was spellbinding – I’d never seen anything like it. I love falling asleep to the distant sound of lions roaring, and waking up to hear hippos making occasional honking sounds like foghorns. “The next morning I was told an elephant climbed into the pool. That experience, coming into contact with Africa’s wildlife in such an effortless way, is one reason I always prefer to organise customers’ accommodation in tented lodges, where I can. “If you haven’t been to Africa before, you might be nervous at the thought of spending a night in a tent which is why I prefer to call them ‘canvas rooms’. They are always set on a solid base or raised deck; they usually have furnished verandahs for afternoon siestas and the tents are equipped like a hotel. Into the wild: Zambezi Sands Lodge ? a good example of one of Stuart's 'canvas rooms' “However, you don’t get the detachment from nature that you would have in a hotel. I love falling asleep to the distant sound of lions roaring, and waking up to hear hippos making occasional honking sounds like foghorns. “As for Hwange National Park – it’s about the size of Wales, and one of Africa’s greatest parks. It’s renowned particularly for its elephants – more than 40,000 of them traverse this region, as well as more than 100 species of other mammals, including eight large carnivores such as wild dogs, lions and cheetahs; 19 large herbivores such as eland, sable, buffalo and wildebeest, and 400 species of birds. “You simply can’t imagine it until you witness it for yourself, and staying right in the middle of all that space – it’s just an out-of-this-world experience that I know our customers will love.” Watch the video interview with Holiday Hunter Stuart Douglass-Lee>> For the latest travel news, sign up to the fortnightly Saga Navigator newsletter , or follow @SagaHolidaysUK", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T22:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T22:24:43.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
