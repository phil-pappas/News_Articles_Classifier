This special promotion represents a saving of $300 per person and reduces the package’s price to $3,399* per person (restrictions apply).\nThe “Garden Route Splendor Luxury Self-Drive” is a tour of the most beautiful towns in South Africa and a luxurious experience of the picturesque Cape Garden Route. The air-inclusive package includes 11 nights in renowned Five Star properties: The Alphen Boutique Hotel, The Mosaic Private Sanctuary Lagoon Lodge, The Turbine Boutique Hotel and Spa, Kichaka Game Lodge and The Miarestate Hotel and Spa. It also includes six lunches and six dinners.\nAfter exploring Cape Town and the wine region at your own pace, start driving along the False Bay coast. The spectacular scenery is made up of charming seaside villages, farms, rivers, coves and valleys. During the right season the whales can be seen cruising and wallowing in the coastal waters. Because a South African adventure would not be complete without a Big Five experience, this tour will also take you on a safari and a two-night stay at Kichaka Game Lodge, on a fully-inclusive basis.\n“Self-driving along the Garden Route of South Africa gives travellers the freedom and flexibility to truly get the most out of their vacation,” said Terry von Guilleaume, President of South African Airways Vacations®. “This is a classic bucket-list road-trip and we are offering free car-rental so now is the best time to experience it!”\nSource: South African Airways", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T00:04:22.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
