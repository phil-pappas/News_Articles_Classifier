There’s no better starting point than the vibrant, historically rich towns of Trujillo and Caceres . Located in the autonomous community of Extremadura that borders on Portugal (Spain has 17 communities, similar to Canadian provinces) both cities are less than three hours southwest from Madrid via excellent highways. \nLike Spain itself, Trujillo’s greatest century was the 16th. At this time, vast riches were captured by native sons, many of who chose dangerous adventure in the New World over the likelihood of poverty if they had stayed home. Their riches not only benefited them, but also their families and hometowns. \nAmong the most famous was Francisco Pizarro, who launched the capture of the Inca Empire and founded the city of Lima, now Peru’s capital. \nAlthough his accomplishments were extraordinary, his path was hardly unique. He was like many other young Extremadura men destined to receive no land or major inheritance. While Pizarro was illegitimate, the same fate awaited many others who were not first-born. \nAmong the most famous of those who came from Extremadura were Hernan Cortes, who took Mexico from the Aztecs; Hernando de Soto, who discovered the Mississippi River; Francisco de Orellana, credited with being the first to explore the entire length of the Amazon River; and Vasco Nunez de Balboa, who discovered the isthmus of Panama. Pizzaro joined Balboa on his early Panamanian expeditions. \nPlaza Mayor is the grand centre of Trujillo, and its highlights include the old town hall with its three tiers of arches, the stately San Martin church, the exterior of the 12th-century Casa de los Cardenas, the Palacio de la Conquista, and an imposing statue of Pizarro. \nYou’ll also want to spend time at the home, and now museum, of Pizarro’s grandfather, where the future conqueror spent much of his childhood. Here are maps, artifacts and a fascinating section depicting the Inca way of life, the culture Pizarro fought hard to obliterate. \nYou can also visit the Palacio de los Duques de San Carlos, now a convent. Most impressive is its dual-storied courtyard. \nAfter centuries of Moorish rule, Trujillo was re-captured by Christian armies in 1232. During succeeding centuries, the most prosperous residents moved down the steep hill from areas nearest the massive Moorish castle, which still dominates the skyline, and began building around the Plaza Mayor. That is why the plaza became the focus of construction by the conquistadores and their families, who grew rich in the Americas. \nToday the castle walls still proudly stand. And climbing up some of Trujillo’s fascinating cobblestoned streets to reach it is well worth the effort. You’ll get a real feel for life during medieval and earlier times, and also encounter a truly formidable fortress. \nJust 44 kilometres away lies Caceres, whose lineage reaches back to the Romans. While Caceres also boasts a bustling Plaza Mayor, there are also massive walls erected by the Moors that flank the plaza (now car-free) and encircle the old town. \nDuring the centuries between the Moorish conquest and the Christian reconquest of 1229, Caceres existed almost exclusively within Moorish walls that encircled their city. Returning Christians rebuilt much of the city and eventually expanded beyond the walls. The Plaza Mayor and areas further afield are all a product of the years following the Moors’ departure. Nevertheless, 30 Moorish towers still stand, including one that is 25 metres tall. You can easily spend several hours wending through the old city exploring its Moorish-designed plazas, gardens, narrow streets and twisting lanes. However, in terms of standing structures, a rich mix of medieval Catholic structures that arose after the Moors departed are most prominent. \nThe Romans built their settlement on the area’s highest land, and though their structures and most of those built before the reconquest are gone, there is plenty to see. Start by walking through the 18th-century Arco d’Estrella . It was built by a nobleman who got permission to knock down a portion of the ancient walls to create an entryway large enough for his carriages to pass through so he could drive to his mansion. \nIndeed, except for small portions of the original walls and some foundation stones, little remains of the Roman construction. A key reason is that the Moors renovated and reworked them. Most prominent of the Moorish construction is the 12thcentury Bujaco Tower, which hovers over the old town as well as Plaza Mayor. Serious viewseekers can climb it Tuesdays through Sundays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., and 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. Also important are the Torre Redonda, Torre Desmochada and Torre de los Pozos, the latter rising 30 metres above the rampart walk. \nIntriguing sites include Plaza Santa Maria, the heart of the old city and home to the Mayoral Palace and stately 16th-century Episcopal Palace. Also see the 16th-century Church of Santa Maria, which started life (as did so many of Spain’s most impressive churches) as a mosque. And, quite nearby are the Palacio de Carvajai and its 15th-century tower. Much of this nobleman’s dwelling can be visited. \nAlso fascinating is the spectacular Palacio de los Golfines de Abajo , which for a time was the home of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella. Another area to seek out are the few remnants of the once-vibrant Jewish quarter, which was vacated following the 1492 expulsion of Spain’s Jews. It was located just outside the city walls. \nTrujillo and Caceres are best visited in the spring and fall. A particularly good time to visit Caceres is during its annual three-day November medieval festival. It features all manner of period foods, sports and entertainment. The city’s extraordinary architecture makes it a perfect setting for immersion into fascinating days past. \nIf you seek other compelling sights nearby, consider some of Extremadura’s other prime sites. These include Guadalupe with its massive and fascinating monastery, and Merida whose Roman ruins include a huge theatre, amphitheatre and two aqueducts. Also, Plasencia features impressive medieval town walls, while Badajoz has retained its Moorish town walls and watchtowers. \nSpanish Tourism provided guides for the writer.
