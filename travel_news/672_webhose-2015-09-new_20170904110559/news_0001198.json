Kathy Hochul said at the unveiling.\nThe 5,000-sqauare-foot exhibit opens to the public on Saturday.\nThe National Toy Hall of Fame was established in 1998 and inducts a slate of toys each year, 56 to date. The Toy Industry Hall of Fame was established in 1985 by the Toy Industry Association and inducts about two people per year. Its current roster is 71.\nExecutives said combining the halls, which will continue to manage their own inductions, gave each a more dynamic and visible exhibition space. The TIA hall has not had a dedicated space for several years. Association President and Chief Executive Steve Pasierb said The Strong was the obvious choice.\n\"Toys come through the imagination of individual designers and people who bring them to life. We needed a home that is fitting, not a children's museum, not a science museum,\" he said.\nThe interactive hall includes a digital Jack-in-the-Box that displays animated toy characters, a 20-foot bubble tower that creates virtual bubbles, an oversized Etch a Sketch and a Crayon piano.\nTwo 10-foot kiosks with touch screen monitors provide biographical background information about the inductees to each hall.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T00:35:13.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
