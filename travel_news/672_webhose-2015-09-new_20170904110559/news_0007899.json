Now the basement excavation craze in the capital could be given a further lease of life by the creation of a \"shrunk down\" digger. JCB has started selling a new model that is 35 per cent smaller than its traditional vehicles. The company said the smaller 3CX Compact model will be able to that can navigate tight lanes and areas where buildings stand in close proximity. The new backhoe loader is 2.74 metres high, down from the normal 4 metres, making it ideal for basement access. Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, said: \"It was the backhoe [digger] that built JCB into the company that it is today and made us famous around the world. \"More and more of our customers have been telling us that they need a backhoe loader that is smaller simply because they are operating in congested towns and cities and on narrow streets,\" he said. JCB Chairman Lord Bamford at the 3CX Compact launch Home owners have begun expanding their properties downwards as house prices have soared in the capital. In expensive west London boroughs such as Fulham, Kensington and Wandsworth, it is seen as one of the cheapest ways to add value and space for an expanding family. Figures last summer, when house prices were rising even more rapidly than today, showed the number of applications for basement excavations were doubling each year in Kensington and Chelsea. Applications involving basements had risen 42 per cent in Hammersmith and Fulham and 34 per cent in Wandsworth in two years, council planning data showed. But planning permission criteria are being tightened in some areas in response to local residents complaining about noise and disruption. JCB said its basement excavation was just one of the many purposes for which its new diggers would be suited. Their single-carriageway turning circle, for example, makes the machines ideal for road maintenance, a spokesman said. \"Some of the demand [for smaller diggers] is from people wanting work done on their homes, such as excavating, but largely it's driven by urban construction sites in general becoming much more congested and buildings being put up in closer proximity to each other,\" he added. dan.hyde@telegraph.co.uk telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T04:39:45.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
