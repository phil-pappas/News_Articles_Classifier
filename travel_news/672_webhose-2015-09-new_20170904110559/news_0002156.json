Would your outlook on life change? It did for Megan Sullivan. \nMegan loves to travel. She had been putting off a major trip, visiting the 7 wonders of the world, for quite some time. One month she saw firsthand that everything really does happen in 3's. In a single month's time she got into a rock climbing accident, then a car accident and then she was diagnosed with skin cancer. \nShe didn't want to put off her trip anymore. She wanted to seize the day! Her luck turned around when she met Chris. The couple had only known each other for two weeks before they set off on their journey. The adventurous duo visited Chichen Itza, Christ the Redeemer, Great Wall of China, Machu Picchu, Petra, Taj Mahal, and the Colosseum just 13 days! What an amazing feat! \nMeghan realized life is precious. Yes, they had only just met each other, but she took a risk and it paid off. Not only did she get a dream adventure, she also got her man. \nFollow HooplaHa on Twitter: www.twitter.com/HooplaHa More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T22:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T23:32:56.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
