The 34-year-old Newton native will perform at Mix 104.1 FM’s annual free fall concert, MixFest , on the Hatch Shell on Sept. 19. We caught up with Platten to talk about all things travel.\nFavorite vacation spot? A close friend’s lake house in Maine. . . . We try to go every summer for Fourth of July and we call it our adult summer camp. Waterskiing, lazy mornings, long, cold swims, lobster nights, campfires complete with guitar playing and s’mores, fireworks, yoga on the dock, midnight star-gazing, pontoon rides, and lots and lots of jokes. It’s pretty magical.\nFavorite food or drink while vacationing? The boys always drink delicious IPAs or ginger beer and whiskey, which I inevitably end up stealing and taking sips of, and the girls drink prosecco, which is amazing in theory (but secretly not as good as the boys’ drinks). Food-wise, oh man, I tend to really indulge on vacation because a lot of my friends are incredible chefs. One friend makes an eggplant parmesan that is heavenly and melts in your mouth, and another makes a chocolate pudding that I can’t resist. Oh and lobster! Did I mention lobster? Swoon.\nWhere would you like to travel to but haven’t? Two places: Bali and Patagonia. Bali because (here we go, so typical) ever since Elizabeth Gilbert’s “Eat Pray Love,” I’ve had a little Bali fantasy. It seems like a place my little soul would love. I’m a yogi and a determined optimist. I feel like Bali represents all of that joy and warmth in the people and culture, tons of yoga (and monkeys!), beautiful colors and just a lot of love. The adventurer in me would love to visit Patagonia, Chile. I’m a closet outdoorsy athletic enthusiast and I would love to do a rafting and hiking trip someday and maybe sleep in a treehouse and bathe in a chilly winding river.\nOne item you can’t leave home without when traveling? My pillow. I’m one of those people at the airport holding a pillow like a little kid. And a yoga mat.\nAisle or window? Window. I like to see where I’m going and I like to curl up against the side and nestle my feet in the little corner and rest them on the seat in front of me. I’m a terrible person to have behind you on a flight, I admit it.\nFavorite childhood travel memory? Chatham in the summer of my junior year of high school. My parents rented a house for a couple months and it was just the best. It was the first summer I was driving and my younger sister, Melanie, was finally old enough that I deemed her “cool enough” to hang out with. We spent the summer in my dad’s old Jeep with the windows down, blasting Jimmy Cliff and Toots and the Maytals, beach hopping and boy gazing in the humid Cape Cod air, and we really became best friends, again.\nGuilty pleasure when traveling? Eating anything that looks delicious and not caring about the calories. My job requires me to be super careful about my diet because I’m being scrutinized a lot. But on vacation, I shut all of that off and just be normal and indulge. It’s the best! Oh, and sleeping in as late as I can!\nBest travel tip? Shut your phone off! I like to let mine run out of batteries and not charge it the entire time and just be completely in the present. It’s the best.", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Ftravel%2F2015%2F09%2F05%2Fthe-vip-lounge-rachel-platten%2FWMjxe2oENnBvKWAQ2oEIHP%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=The", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Ftravel%2F2015%2F09%2F05%2Fthe-vip-lounge-rachel-platten%2FWMjxe2oENnBvKWAQ2oEIHP%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tThe", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Ftravel%2F2015%2F09%2F05%2Fthe-vip-lounge-rachel-platten%2FWMjxe2oENnBvKWAQ2oEIHP%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=The", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The", "http://mix1041.cbslocal.com/category/mixfest/", "https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Ftravel%2F2015%2F09%2F05%2Fthe-vip-lounge-rachel-platten%2FWMjxe2oENnBvKWAQ2oEIHP%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&media=//c.o0bg.com/rw/Boston/2011-2020/2015/08/31/BostonGlobe.com/Travel/Images/RP-"], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T08:37:26.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
