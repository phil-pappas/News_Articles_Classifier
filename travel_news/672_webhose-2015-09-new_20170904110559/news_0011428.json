It can be installed inside an airline’s operational environment or as a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution. Aided by CellPoint Mobile’s pre-integrated payment data, airlines can bring payment solutions to market quickly, reduce the cost of payments by improving relationships with PSPs and boost revenues by giving passengers more paths to purchase as they travel.\n“With the payments ecosystem shifting to the mobile marketplace, airlines are looking to solutions that can deliver Apple Pay and other alternative payment methods to the marketplace quickly,” said CEO Gjerding. “Rather than spending weeks or months integrating a new payment method and channel, airlines can now launch Apple Pay in hours, and without the usual challenges of data integration and costly IT resources.”\nSource:- CellPoint Mobile", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T18:10:14.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
