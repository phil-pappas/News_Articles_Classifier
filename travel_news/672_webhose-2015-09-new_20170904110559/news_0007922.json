I am thinking of heading to Myanmar but am unsure of the best amount of time to go for, where to go and how much I should budget. I am a solo female traveller and will be backpacking but from what I have read there are a lot of restrictions on border crossings, and overland travel is slow and unreliable. Any ideas? \nA. I would recommend a guided coach tour such as Geckos Adventures. You could also look into Busabout, which offers some in-depth Burmese adventures. The best months to visit are from November to February, but consider going either side of this peak period as the weather is still good and the top spots a lot less crowded. For all other questions such as border crossings, restrictions and lots of tips for travelling safely as a solo female traveller, pop in-store and chat with one of our experts. - Helen Moffitt, senior travel consultant, House of Travel Remuera. \nGot a travel question?
