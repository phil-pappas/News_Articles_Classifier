The city claims Tilikum Crossing , at 1,720 feet, is the longest car-free span in the country. Fourteen-foot-wide outer lanes on either side of the bridge are reserved for cyclists and pedestrians. In addition to improving transit connections, the bridge presents a new spectacle at night in LED lighting that changes colors based on river conditions, including water height, speed and temperature. INTERNATIONAL STOPOVERS IN TORONTO Air Canada would like American fliers to consider flying through Toronto en route to Europe and Asia. To do so, the carrier has introduced a new multi-city booking option that allows stays of up to a week in Toronto amid onward flights without the extra fees normally incurred by stopovers. The offer is good on trips booked until Oct. 31. The airline offers service to Toronto from 45 cities in the United States, and in Toronto Americans returning home clear U.S. customs while still in Canada. NEW BOSTON-WESTCHESTER FLIGHTS Competing with Amtrak’s Acela, Delta Shuttle and myriad bus services, Tradewind Aviation , a shuttle and charter service, will start new service between New York and Boston. Beginning Oct. 5, the flights, between Westchester County and Boston Logan airports, will operate year-round eight times daily Monday through Friday with rates from $295 one way. In addition, the carrier plans to add weekend flights from Westchester to Stowe, Vt., in December, from $350 one way. AND ALL-YOU-CAN-FLY, BOSTON-WESTCHESTER For the most frequent of fliers between New York and Boston, the new service Beacon , launching Tuesday, will offer unlimited flights for a monthly fee. Like Netflix for the air, Beacon will charge members $2,000 per month, plus a one-time $1,000 initiation fee, for which they can fly as often as they like. Making bookings online or via the Beacon smartphone app, fliers are limited to holding four reservations at any time. Founded by several executives who introduced the similar service Surf Air in California in 2013, the company plans to operate approximately nine flights each way between Westchester County and Logan airports using six-seat jets.
