By Michael Rubinkam Of The Associated Press United Continental Holdings Flight 93 visitor center to open \nSHANKSVILLE — Gordon Felt knew his brother was sitting directly in front of two of the terrorists who hijacked United Airlines Flight 93. \nBut it \"never really hit me,\" Felt said, until he walked through the new, immersive visitor center at the Flight 93 National Memorial. There it was, the seating chart with his sibling's name on it: Edward Felt, first class, second row. Flight 93 visitor center opens \nSitting on a hill overlooking the crash site near Shanksville, Pa., the new Flight 93 complex was dedicated and opened to the public on Thursday, Sept. 10, 2015, one day before the annual 9/11 observance in Somerset County. \nSitting on a hill overlooking the crash site near Shanksville, Pa., the new Flight 93 complex was dedicated and opened to the public on Thursday, Sept. 10, 2015, one day before the annual 9/11 observance in Somerset County.

Victims' family members got a private tour on Wednesday. \nFourteen years in the making, the center uses photos, video, artifacts and interactive displays to tell the story of Flight 93, the only jetliner among the four commandeered by terrorists that failed to reach its intended target on Sept. 11, 2001. Two planes crashed into the World Trade Center towers in New York and one slammed into the Pentagon outside Washington, D.C. More than 3,000 people died. \nThe center's 10 exhibits are laid out chronologically, with visitors learning how the 33 passengers and seven crew members — at least some of them already aware the nation was under attack — voted to charge the cockpit and then fought to regain control of the plane, whose hijackers are believed to have wanted to crash it into the U.S. Capitol. \n\"You are seeing an incredible story of heroism, a piece of American history playing out in front of you as you are walking through this exhibit that gives perspective on the day,\" said Felt, president of Families of Flight 93. \nOne video traces the aircraft's erratic movements in real time, fading to black at the moment of impact. Bits and pieces of the debris field are displayed under glass. \nPicking up a handset, visitors can listen to recordings of the voice messages that two passengers and a flight attendant left for family members minutes before plane went down. \n\"I'm on United 93 and it's been hijacked by terrorists who say they have a bomb,\" passenger Linda Gronlund, calling her sister Elsa, begins matter-of-factly. \"Apparently they have flown a couple of planes into the World Trade Center already and it looks like they're going to take this one down as well.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T04:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T00:54:54.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
