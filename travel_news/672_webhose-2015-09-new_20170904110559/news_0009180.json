It will focus on the emergence of the sharing economy, both in accommodation and transport sectors, and how it could reshape the future of business travel.\n“Some trends blow over,” said Iwamoto, “but others are game-changers, and the sharing economy is definitely in the latter category.”\nMore and more companies are realising the rewards of implementing a strategic meetings management programme to drive key business benefits through rationalising travel and events spend, and delivering more effective meetings. However, understanding the concept can be quite different to implementation, according to Iwamoto, who’s second session at CTW Bangkok shows delegates SMM in action through the experience of major pharmaceuticals business Pfizer with the help of the company’s Global Meetings Policy and Platform Lead, Jung Ji-Hee.\nUsing Technology for Attendee Engagement then sees Iwamoto present a session on what meeting planners can do to grab and hold an audience’s attention when “the average attention span of an event delegate is now eight seconds ¬¬– one second less than a goldfish”.\n“But more than this,” said Iwamoto, “I will show how technology can deliver ongoing attendee engagement – before, during and after an event – for more effective results.”\nIwamoto’s Bangkok education marathon kicks off at 9am on Wednesday 30 September with Megatrends, closely followed by SMM in Action at 11.30am and Technology for Attendee Engagement at 1.30pm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T03:38:14.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
