The resort, which opened August 1 , incorporates all the Six Senses sustainability benchmarks for which the group is recognized and has now taken a step further with the introduction of a Tesla Model S electric vehicle for airport transfers.\nAs the first hotel in Chengdu to offer such a sustainable experience, it is a testament to the eco-friendly initiatives that drive Six Senses. The vehicle, which accommodates three to four passengers and offers generous luggage capacity, travels up to 310 miles (500 kilometers) on a single charge from a standard power outlet. Using the Tesla Supercharge system, the vehicle can be fully charged in less than one hour.\nGuest’s arrival experience is also enhanced with the addition of the vehicle’s all-glass panoramic roof constructed from lightweight safety glass, which gives the feel of a convertible yet with total protection from the elements. In the beautiful setting of Six Senses Qing Cheng Mountain, this feature is a real winner.\nFor those who are more technically minded, the Tesla Model S is equipped with an 85 kilowatt-hour battery and a high performance drive inverter, and accelerates to 60 miles (97 kilometers) per hour in 4.2 seconds. Unlike the internal combustion engine with hundreds of moving pieces that spark, pump, belch and groan, the Tesla motor has only one moving piece: the rotor. As a result, Model S acceleration is instantaneous and without using a drop of gasoline.\nThe makers claim that they have taken one of the world’s best sedans into supercar handling territory, while also improving ride quality and range. In addition to upgraded dampers, bushings, stabilizer bars and tires (Michelin Pilot Sport PS2), the rear tires are 0.8 inch (20 millimeters) wider and staggered for improved acceleration on low grip surfaces.\nMichael Murphy, general manager of Six Senses Qing Cheng Mountain said, “I am thrilled that Six Senses Qing Cheng Mountain has partnered with Tesla to promote our shared sustainable values with our guests. We invite the Tesla community to enjoy an eco-driven experience at Six Senses and proudly offer four complimentary charging stations at the property. It’s a great way to not only reconnect, but also to recharge in more ways than one.”\nSo, when arriving at Six Senses Qing Cheng Mountain, guests can do so in style and with the knowledge that there is no cleaner or more responsible way to travel. Transfers between Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport (CTU) and the resort are a one-hour drive and should be made at the time of booking to ensure that guests enjoy the latest and cleanest travel technology on the planet.\nSource:- Six Senses Hotels Resorts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:43:08.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
