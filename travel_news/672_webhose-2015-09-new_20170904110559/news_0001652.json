This is a step in the merger of US Airways into American Airlines.\nThis first move is temporary and means passengers who need ticket counter services such as baggage check for US Airways flights will now find them at the far east end of the ticketing lobby. However, passengers who already have their boarding passes and do not need to ticket counter services are advised that US Airways/American Airlines flights departing Tucson from Phoenix will continue to leave from gates on the B Concourse.\nThe next step in the merger is due to take place October 17 when all flights will operate as American Airlines but even what that occurs, Phoenix departures/arrivals will remain on the B concourse while flights to and from Chicago, Dallas-Fort worth and Los Angeles will operate from the A concourse.\nUltimately, the plan at Tucson International Airport is for American Airlines to relocate all of its operations to the west end of the terminal and use gates on the B Concourse but construction for that isn’t expected to be completed for at least three months. In the meantime, passengers should pay close attention to their departing gate assignments.The Tucson Airport Authority (TAA) is an independent, non-profit organization operating Tucson International Airport and general aviation reliever Ryan Airfield. TAA has sustained its operations since its origin in 1948 from airport generated revenues without the use of local taxes, and continues to invest millions of dollars each year in safety, security and facility infrastructure that drives job creation and economic activity for the benefit of Tucson and southern Arizona. The two airports currently support 35,000 jobs and house more than 100 tenants, and serve a diverse mix of both aviation and non-aviation related businesses, as well as military and government operations.\nSource:- Tucson International Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T12:42:45.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
