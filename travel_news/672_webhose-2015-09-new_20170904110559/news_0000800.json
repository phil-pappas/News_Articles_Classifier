Credit: ITV Border Campaigners say services on the new Borders Railway have been hit by problems, including overcrowding and delays.\nThe line opened to paying passengers on Sunday 6 September with an official opening by the Queen on Wednesday 9.\nBut this weekend, members of the Campaign for Borders Rail say services were in disarray, with passengers being forced to wait at platforms for the next service as not enough carriages were put on.\nSome passengers claim they had to wait nearly 20 minutes for delayed services.\nThere were also problems with ticket machines not recognising the new stations on the line, and the machine at Tweedbank not connecting to the banking system.\nSome passengers were saying it was so busy that they had to stand, some couldn't board the trains.\nI think Scotrail have fallen short.\nThere have been delays on the trains for various reasons. If a train arrives late in Tweedbank, and then its late going back to Edinburgh, then all the other trains are delayed.\nThey have to keep an eye on this and make sure trains run on time or it will turn people off the trains altogether.\"\nâ€“ Atholl Innes, Campaign for Borders Rail Last updated Mon 14 Sep 2015 Read more 2 updates Teething problems for Borders Railway Travel Scottish Borders Borders Railway", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T23:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T05:03:16.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
