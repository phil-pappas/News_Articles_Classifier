The comfortable outside environments that pests once thrived in will be nonexistent and they will have to find a new home. These new homes are often the buildings where we live and work.\n“The autumn months start to bring in more pest related calls. We encourage facilities to take a preventative approach. Assured Environments’ Integrated Pest Management services are a solid defense against pest problems for commercial facilities and can be tailored to meet Green Shield or LEED certified properties,” Assured Environments VP of Operations, Andrew Feldstein notes.\nCommon Cold Weather Pests:\nAnts: These are the most common winter pests. To prevent ants from invading, make sure to eliminate any standing water and don’t leave food out. Seal cracks in the foundation and keep tree branches and plants cut back from the exterior.\nBed Bugs: Bedbugs are extremely difficult to get rid of without professional help and are very easily transported from one area to another. Their size lets them hide in folds of luggage, bags and clothes. They are notorious for showing up in dorm rooms, hotels and apartment buildings.\nCockroaches: Capable of spreading 33 different kinds of bacteria, they make their way into bags of food and can damage wallpaper, woodwork or electronics. They are even capable of spreading germs to humans. The best ways to prevent cockroaches is to vacuum frequently and make sure cracks in the foundation are sealed. Make sure to fix any water leaks.\nRats and Mice: In addition to spreading disease, building nests and chewing through wiring , rodents carry fleas, ticks and lice. Make sure food is stored in airtight containers and isn’t left out on counters. Keep doors closed and make sure windows are sealed. Also be sure to secure all outlet and drain covers.\nStink Bugs: These harmless insects emit a foul odor when frightened. They can damage clothing, furniture and other materials with their droppings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T18:16:32.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
