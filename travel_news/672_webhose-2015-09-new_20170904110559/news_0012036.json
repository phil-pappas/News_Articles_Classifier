The MIP was established to serve the interests of both Intertain and investors, generating substantial reinvestments in the Company, rewarding management for growth and acquisition performance, and contributing to a substantial increase in shareholder value. Notwithstanding this, the Company recognizes that the MIP has become a source of concern for certain shareholders. Consequently, the Board intends to reevaluate the MIP and until such time as a full re-evaluation is completed, John Kennedy FitzGerald, President and CEO, and Keith Laslop, CFO, have agreed to forego all entitlements under the MIP on any future transactions completed by the Company. \nBackground on Intertain's MIP \nThe Board engaged GGA to provide independent third-party counsel to evaluate compensation plan options within months of the Company going public. GGA undertook to develop Intertain's compensation philosophy and peer group, as well as design an executive compensation program that aligned executive compensation with shareholder interests. \nGGA is a recognized global professional advisory firm that exclusively assists boards, executives and investment organizations in maximizing the effectiveness of their executive compensation, board governance, and overall human resources committee mandate. They are independent and work primarily via board-sponsored mandates. \nAfter reviewing multiple programs over a number of months, the Board approved GGA's recommended MIP as it had the best design to align shareholder value with executive compensation. Despite approval by the Board of the principles and terms contained in the MIP in November 2014, management agreements were only signed and the MIP formally approved by the Compensation Committee in May 2015. The MIP was disclosed publicly in Intertain's Management Information Circular dated May 20, 2015. \nMIP Structure \nThere are three key elements to the MIP and the manner in which it is tied to acquisitions: The MIP bonus pool is equal to 2% of the value of each transaction successfully completed by the Company That amount is modified by the increase or decrease in market price for the common shares from the date the transaction is publicly announced to the date the transaction closes Management receives 25% in cash and the balance, at the discretion of the Board, in phantom equity units, to ensure that future shareholder returns are aligned with future realized value of the compensation, or cash \nIn addition, the MIP includes a number of safeguards that permit the Board to ensure that the interests of investors are met: Management has, at no time, been guaranteed bonuses The Board has discretion to modify the final amount of the bonus pool for each transaction based on all relevant circumstances and the discretion to cap total compensation \nManagement Investment & MIP Awards \nThe MIP was used as the basis to compensate Intertain's two most senior executives, John Kennedy FitzGerald and Keith Laslop, while encouraging Company growth, increasing value and rewarding investors. Mr. FitzGerald and Mr. Laslop spent the year prior, and the time since Intertain went public, building the Company and personally providing investment as part of every transaction to date. All investments made by management were at the same price as other investors. Mandalay: Management invested $2.5 million into the public financing round (Mr. FitzGerald: $2.0 million; Mr. Laslop: $500,000) Vera&John: Management provided the Company a $10.0 million bridge loan at the prime interest rate, saving Intertain substantial bridge fees Vera&John: Management exercised all warrants held by them from previous investments (Mr. FitzGerald: $730,000; Mr. Laslop: $186,250) Jackpotjoy: Management invested $7.4 million into the financing round (Mr. FitzGerald: $4.4 million; Mr. Laslop: $3.0 million) \nMr. FitzGerald and Mr. Laslop are amongst two of the largest individual shareholders of Intertain. Intertain also announces that Mr. FitzGerald and Mr. Laslop each purchased an additional 100,000 common shares in the open market today. On an after-tax basis, with respect to the aggregate salary and bonuses received by them in 2014 and 2015, Mr. FitzGerald and Mr. Laslop have invested more money during that period for the purchase of Intertain equity securities than they have received in after-tax compensation. \nGiven this level of personal investment as well as the specific provisions and protections inherent in the MIP, the interests of management and shareholders are aligned. There is no incentive for non-strategic acquisitions given the substantial ownership management has assumed in the Company and the discretion afforded the Board to nullify any award funded under the MIP acts as a strong guarantor of investors' interests. Summary \nIntertain's Board maintains confidence in the MIP and has the highest regard for the performance of the management team. The Board believes that the MIP has helped to align shareholder and management interests as has been evidenced in performance to date. \nAll information provided related to management's investment in the Company is available under Intertain's profile at www.sedi.ca . \nConference Call \nA conference call to discuss Intertain's MIP will be held on Tuesday, September 1, 2015 at 8:00am ET.
