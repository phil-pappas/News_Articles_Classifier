The leading contemporary sports and lifestyle destination has become the newest member of IMG Prestige – an exclusive collection of some of the world’s most celebrated golfing venues – while it has also joined forces with HSBC’s Premier Golf Network to promote the resort to its wide-reaching membership database. \nVerdura, which features two championship courses amongst its outstanding golf facilities and hosted the Sicilian Open in 2012, joins an illustrious list of courses in the IMG Prestige portfolio including Kingsbarns, Scotland; Carton House, Ireland; Cape Kidnappers, New Zealand; Le Touessrok, Mauritius; Spain’s La Manga Club and Yas Links in the United Arab Emirates. IMG Prestige’s global reciprocal programme brings together a collection of the finest golfing facilities in the world in recognition of the exceptional experience they provide members and guests both on and off the course. The HSBC Premier Golf Network was launched seven years ago for HSBC Premier Customers with savings or investments of £50,000 or more or an annual income of at least £100,000. The network is an exclusive free online resource for customers with monthly articles from leading golf publications, competitions, discounted lessons and tee times, golf breaks, latest equipment reviews and online tuition. Marcello Della Vecchia, Director of Golf Sales at Verdura Resort, said: “IMG and HSBC are two of golf’s biggest global supporters and it’s a great privilege for Verdura to be working alongside them. “We’re delighted to have partnered with two companies dedicated to delivering a high-quality service to their customers and are excited at the opportunity to meet and develop many new relationships with their members over the coming months.” Set in 230 hectares of stunning landscape, Verdura – a Rocco Forte hotel – is a golfers’ dream and features two outstanding 18-hole championship courses – the East Course and West Course – as well as a par-three nine hole course. Designed by world-renowned architect Kyle Phillips, the three links-style layouts have been built to the highest specifications, with tee times arranged at 12-minute intervals to ensure free-flowing play, five sets of tees making the courses playable for golfers of all abilities and one of its courses dedicated daily to two-ball play only. Complementing the courses are extensive practice facilities including a double-ended driving range and excellent golf academy, while players can also take advantage of the latest state-of-the-art TaylorMade equipment when they hire clubs at the resort after a significant upgrade of its rental service this summer. Verdura, also a member of Leading Hotels of the World, has won widespread recognition across the luxury global travel industry since opening in 2009 with honours including a ‘Golden Award for Golf‘ at the 2015 Voyages & Hôtels Readers Awards and being named ‘Best Family European Golf Resort‘ by the 2011 Tatler Travel Guide. Situated on Sicily’s southern coast between Agrigento and the fishing city of Sciacca, an 80-minute drive from Trapani and Palermo airports, the resort features 203 rooms and suites – all with a sea view. Away from the fairways, guests can enjoy numerous other sports and leisure facilities including six tennis courts, a 60m two-tiered infinity pool, a 170sqm fully-equipped gym and an award-winning 4,000sqm spa complex.
