Despite his disabilities, it’s a trip the boy has made solo before. And each time David made the trek to see his family, his mother, Vidulah Bysooa, would book an aisle seat for her son, as it makes him feel more relaxed, according to the Evening Standard . Vidulah did the same with this flight on Air Mauritius, however, it was a full plane, and David was given an aisle seat. According to the Evening Standard , David kept leaning over the woman next to him, presumably to peer out the window, while still on the tarmac. Related: Why Are So Many People Getting Kicked Off Planes? The woman complained and the crew was unable to find David an alternate seat. David became upset, and at the captain’s request, he was removed from the plane. “The way my son was treated was appalling,” Vidulah told the Evening Standard . “This is someone who frequently flies with the airline and is well known. They should have understood why he needed to have a window seat. “He is more than capable of flying on his own,” she continued, “but the way he was discriminated against is disgraceful.” David’s mother contacted the Civil Aviation Authority (which is like the U.S.’s Federal Aviation Authority, but in the U.K. it’s a private corporation), and the group Achieving for Children has taken up the Bysooas’ cause. In an email to an advocate from that group, Air Mauritius (which did not offer any refund for the missed flight) said that the airline cannot guarantee specific seats on the plane. Yet it went on to say that woman David was leaning over was a “nervous flyer” who had booked a window seat. According to the Evening Standard , the email also said that David had created “a very uncomfortable atmosphere” and that “the decision [to remove David from the aircraft] was not taken lightly.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T16:22:50.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
