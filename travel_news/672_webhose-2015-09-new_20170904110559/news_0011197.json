Prague seems closer and more beautiful than ever before and you want your romantic holiday to be one to remember. Rest assured: you could not have chosen a better location to get engaged. \nA Dream-like Atmosphere at your Fingertips \nA charismatic, fairytale city bursting at the seams with charming architecture and iconic landmarks, there are fewer places more romantic than Prague. If you're planning to propose, there are arguably very few destinations with as many options as there are types of proposals, but Prague is one of them. \nYou can choose the ever-popular Old Town or the lovely Lesser Town; you can travel further to one of the city’s stunning parks or do it at the top of a hill; you can even ask the all-important question inside a medieval castle! Figure out which location suits you and your partner best, and you can ensure you end up with a precious, lifelong memory. And, if you want to get engaged at the very beginning of your trip so you can spend the rest of the time celebrating, you can always book an airport shuttle service that will take you directly to your preferred location! \nA Historical Location at Dawn \nIf you're desperately in love but sometimes find it difficult to agree when it comes to architectural likes and dislikes, the Charles Bridge is the perfect compromise. A beautiful fourteenth century stone bridge across the Vltava River, it connects the Old Town with the Lesser Town and offers a breathtaking view of Prague. \nAs you can imagine, this pathway between two of the main areas in the city gets incredibly busy during the day. Plan your proposal for the early hours of the morning: the sun rising over the horizon will offer picture-perfect lighting and the awakening city will make the perfect soundtrack. \nA Secluded, Spectacular Setting \nPetYín Hill is a conveniently central green space in the heart of Prague. With plenty of parks to choose from, whether it’s your love of nature that brings you here or a weakness for sun-drenched picnics, the location could not be more ideal. \nYou start by taking a cable car to the top of the hill, and then walk back down at a leisurely pace, overlooking vineyards and almond groves. If this sounds appealing but you would like a bit more privacy, follow the stone fence down the path to a door-sized hole in the wall; through it you will find a small courtyard with spectacular views of the city and the perfect spot to get down on one knee. \nReach New Heights \nFinally, the Jindrisska Tower (connecting Wenceslas Square, Charles Square, and Senovazne Square) and the Powder Tower (originally an entrance to the city) are iconic locations to propose, as long as neither of you are scared of heights! \nGetting There \nPrague city centre is easily reachable from the airport by public transport or airport shuttle service, and all of the locations mentioned are central and straightforwardly accessible. Don’t second-guess yourself: make Prague the backdrop of a memorable holiday.   from ArticlesFactory.com ABOUT THE AUTHOR \nLukas Johannes is a driver for Shuttle Direct.
