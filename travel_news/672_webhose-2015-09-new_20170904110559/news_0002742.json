A tyre is a strong, flexible rubber casing attached to the rim of a wheel. Tyres act as a cushion for the wheels of a moving vehicle and also impart a gripping surface for traction. Tyres can be found on all vehicles such as cars, trucks, buses, aircrafts, tractors, industrial vehicles, bicycles, motorcycles, etc. Tyres for most vehicles are pneumatic - which means that air is held under pressure inside the tyre. Initially, pneumatic tyres had an inner tube to hold the air pressure, but recent developments have enabled them to be designed to form a pressure seal with the rim of the wheel.\nThe first pneumatic tyre with an inner tube was invented by Robert Thomson in 1845 and later reinvented in the 1880s by John Boyd Dunlop , after which they became immediately popular. Tyre manufacturing today represents a multibillion dollar industry with large manufacturing plants across the globe producing more than 2.6 billion new tyres in 2014. The main raw materials required for producing tyres are natural rubber, synthetic rubber and carbon black. Sulphur and some other raw material are also required depending upon the type of tyre that is being manufactured. Although, with advancements in technology the tyre manufacturing process today has become highly automated, skilled workers are still required to assemble the components of a tyre.\nThe tyre industry can be broken into two key segments â€“ the OEM and replacement sectors. The demand for tyres in the OEM sector is dependent on the sales trend of new vehicles, while the demand in the replacement sector is related to usage patterns and replacement cycles. Globally, the replacement tyre sector dominates the total tyre market. In terms of the various automobile segments, passenger cars currently account for the majority of the total global tyre sales. Passenger cars are followed by trucks. Region-wise, China currently represents the largest market for tyres. Driven by strong economic growth, robust automobile sales and infrastructure developments, the tyre market in China has experienced double digit growth rates in the past five years. China was followed by Europe , the United States and Japan .\nIMARC's latest study \"Tyre Manufacturing Plant Project Report: Industry Trends, Manufacturing Process, Machinery, Raw Materials, Cost and Revenue\" provides a techno-commercial roadmap for setting up a tyre manufacturing plant.
