Updated Articles and Resources Rainy Season in Central America. Kirsten Hubbard Rainy Season in Central America: In most Central America countries, rainy season takes place during July, August and September, give or take a month or two depending on the region. But what exactly does Central America rainy season mean for travelers? Packing for Central America rainy season \nI receive that question a ton in my inbox. In fact, I'd say it's the one I'm most frequently asked. Will rainy season ruin my trip to Central America? Will it rain the whole time? \nMy answer: I've traveled in Central America during rainy season many times, on both coasts and in almost every country. Every single one of those trips has been amazing. Did it rain? Absolutely -- sometimes, torrentially! Did it get in the way of activities? Sometimes. Did it ruin my vacation? Absolutely not. If you're considering traveling during Central America's rainy season, here are a few things to keep in mind: Central America travel is cheaper during rainy season. Also, that means far fewer tourists, which can be fantastic when taking in Central America's sights. Tip: Keep an eye out for rainy season discounts, including airfare. Even in the height of Central America rainy season, it rarely rains all day. Different regions vary, but typically, the storms tend to roll in during the afternoon and evening, often raining into the night. Tip: Plan your outdoor activities in the morning. Pack for the rain. Depending on where you are, rains can be warm or cool. You'll want a windbreaker and shoes that can handle rain and mud. I always bring several of those fold-away plastic ponchos, for wrapping around me and/or my backpack. You never know when you'll need to walk a few blocks in the rain! In Central America, rainy season is also known as the \"green season\", because the landscape is far, far more lush than it is in the dryer months. Tip: Don't make the mistake of heading somewhere remote before a storm, because you might get stuck. In Nicaragua, once we took a rundown cab to an isolated beach; as soon as the rain began, swollen streams crisscrossed the road back. We had to climb out of the cab and wait in the storm while it forded the streams! Definitely one of those Central America adventures. Rainy season is one thing, but hurricane season is another. If you're traveling in a hurricane-prone region, like the Caribbean coasts of Belize and Honduras, pay attention to the news and heed any storm warnings. \nWet season or dry season, rain or shine, Central America travel is incredible.
