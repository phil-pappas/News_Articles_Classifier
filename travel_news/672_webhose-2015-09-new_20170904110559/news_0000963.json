Visit seaworldparks.co.uk .\nOn a clear day, the vista extends all the way to the massive Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center.\nBut that is far from all there is at 20-acre I-Drive 360, which has two other signature attractions from the Merlin Entertainments group, a Skeletons museum, two nightclubs, eight restaurants, four cafes and six boutique shops.\nUnder the same roof are Madame Tussauds and SeaLife Orlando, two attractions that have been given a Floridian twist with interactive elements and local style, with the inclusion of a Walt Disney tableau in Madame Tussauds and an Everglades section in the aquarium. Both are also family-friendly, with plenty to engage all ages.\nAll three add up to a good half-day of excitement – more if you add on Skeletons: Animals Unveiled, a look at 400 animals as bare-bones exhibits, displayed in active dioramas.\nReady to eat? The restaurant choice runs from Ben & Jerry’s ice cream to the Outback Steakhouse, sushi at Naru and Spanish style at Tapa Toro, as well as the pub vibe of The Yard House.\nWant more? Try Cowgirls Rockbar, where you can party into the small hours and ride Orlando’s only mechanical bull, while Tin Roof keeps the party going with live music all week.\nIt all adds up to a fabulous new array of fun at I-Drive 360 – or you could just call it wheely great.\nTRAVEL FACTS Virgin Atlantic ( virgin-atlantic.com ) offers return flights from Gatwick to Orlando from £669pp.\nFor accommodation, visit legolandhotel.com .
