Using Smart Picture, OnSource Photo Inspections find, count, and size those dents automatically, thereby speeding up a claims process that used to take a lot of time for insurance companies.\nThere are dents, and there are dents\nIf a dent is very badly stretched, too large or too deep there will be higher costs to repair the damage. Quickly finding the severity of the dent gives the estimating team intelligence to decide how to triage each policyholder's dented vehicle. At the click of a button the Smart Picture technology that's integrated into OnSource's suite of photo inspection mobile apps give the estimating team additional information about the composition of the dent automatically.\nHow the technology works\nSmart Picture Technologies captures vital scale and geometric info with the snap of a picture to give information on the count and size of dents. Having this information enables the adjuster to quickly determine the total number of dents on a vehicle, the size of the dents, and the general severity allowing the policyholder and insurer to choose the appropriate option for dent repair, body shop work with repainting, or paint less dent (PDR) repair.\nYou can extract measurements from any photo that has a target or a reference measurement with just a click, so not only can you quickly count the number of dents, but you can estimate the size of each dent.\nTim Schneider , Co-Founder of OnSource declares, \"We think this technology will help insurance companies find dents more quickly and accurately. It can also be especially useful for fleet services in identifying dents and dings. Using the Smart Picture technology, OnSource is bringing our photo inspections to the next level of visual data collection, providing instant intelligence right from our pictures.\" Insurers benefit by having more value from their photo inspections, enabling faster and more accurate estimates.\nKari Myllykoski , Founder of Smart Picture Technologies said, \"We are happy to be working with OnSource as our partner to the insurance industry, and we have closely integrated with their mobile insurance apps. Our patented rapid dent and hail detection technology increases productivity, saves time and reduces human error.\"\nLearn more from Tim and Kari in the upcoming webinar \" Automated Dent Detection, Right From Your Phone \" on Wednesday, September 30 th at 1:00 pm EST .\nFor more information, please email jcass@onsourceonline.com .\nAbout OnSource\nOnSource enables insurance companies to get fast, fair and efficient claims and underwriting photo inspections through intuitive smartphone apps that take the guesswork out of insurance photography.
