Somers (@DL_Somers) September 8, 2015 \nBingham told of his ordeal in a statement: \"The plane accelerated for take-off, then there was a loud bang and jolt followed by an abrupt stop. \"At that point, I thought the plane was going to tip on its side or crash. \"Many people were screaming, with some then shouting about fire. Then I saw thick black smoke from the windows on both sides of the aircraft, but the cabin crew were still telling us to stay seated at that point. Seconds later, the pilot ordered the evacuation. \"Once out of the plane, the staff were screaming at us to run away. I started to run and looked back towards the plane to see that it was on fire with flames reaching twice the height of the aircraft. \"All I could think was that if it reaches the fuel tanks and explodes we will be killed.\" \nBingham said he is still suffering from the incident and has regular flashbacks, adding: 'You simply never expect something like this to happen. I am continuing to suffer from the effects of what happened, but I know we are all incredibly lucky not to have been more seriously injured.' \nA spokesman for Irwin Mitchell, a UK law firm, said it was acting for 40 passengers from Britain and Ireland who were on board the flight. The spokesman said: \"There are a number of potential defendants but our investigation into who is ultimately liable for this incident is ongoing.\" An apology letter from BA.
