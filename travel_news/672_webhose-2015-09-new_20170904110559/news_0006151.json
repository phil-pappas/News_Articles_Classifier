My name’s Leah Eades and I’m an English Literature graduate. I’ve been using my Kindle to read books for one year, two months and five days now. \nI don’t know if you know any literature students, but I sure do. I was one. I studied with them. I even lived with some. Literature students are the true bookworms: the people who study books purely because the mere sight of non-literary works makes our eyes bleed poetical tears at the ugliness of the language and imagery. (See what I did there? Classic literature student.) \nMy point is, if you’re looking for book lovers: we’re your guys. \nSo what I’m trying to say is that I understand your reticence to giving in to the electronic revolution – I do! Technology’s already taken so much from us: our attention spans, our joy in lame special effects in movies, even our CD collections. But now it’s trying to take away our books? Never! \nFor most of us, reading is an old habit. Something we’ve done since childhood. We can look back and remember being curled up under our duvets with a torch in one hand and the latest instalment of ‘Goosebumps’ in the other. We can remember every single midnight release of ‘Harry Potter’. We can remember ploughing our way through whatever book we were reading on long car journeys until we got motion sickness every single time , just because we loved reading so damn much. \nAnd at the heart of our love of reading you find: the book. It’s like a treasured childhood teddy bear or comfort blanket, except it has tens of thousands of faces and can be picked up from anywhere for next to nothing. Books are amazing, and infinite, and timeless. \nWe don’t want technology to ruin the soul of a good book. \nI used to feel this way too – but then my love of books came face-to-face with the other great love of my life: travel. I became familiar with the difficulties inherent to reading voraciously whilst gallivanting all over the world. \nIt was only then that I realized that Kindles, nooks and e-readers of all types are not the enemy of traditional books. Nothing will replace the feel of a treasured book in your hands, or the sight of the long-awaited final instalment of a series piled high in the shops. But that’s OK. E-readers aren’t for that. E-readers aren’t trying to take that feeling away from you. Books aren’t going to die out because of E-readers. \nPeople use all sorts of excuses to avoid the e-reader: “It’s another thing that needs charging”, “They make you a target for theft” and “They take away the social aspect of sharing books” are all common complaints. And indeed these are all valid points. However, dig a little deeper and it all boils down to the same complaint: “It doesn’t feel the same as a real book!” \nNo, it doesn’t. But it does mean that you have access to the entire world’s library at your fingertips, no matter where you are in the world. And that’s a pretty amazing thing. When you’re travelling you want something lightweight, in a language you can read, and that will offer you endless hours of reading. That’s why an e-reader is perfect. Ultimately, we don’t really love books because of the feel of them – it’s the words and the story contained within that we love. And that remains unchanged. \nIt’s not like it has to be an all-or-nothing thing: when I travel, I tend to have space in my bag for one book as well as my Kindle at any one time. That way you can still pick up and swap books en route, and have something you can leave by your towel on a beach without worrying – but you still have a back-up for those inevitable times between books. It’s the best of both worlds! E-readers don’t mean you have to lose out on anything; rather, they are a great addition to any travelling bookworm’s packing list.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T16:03:01.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
