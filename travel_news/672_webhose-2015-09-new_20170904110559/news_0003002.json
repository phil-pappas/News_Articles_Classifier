Natalie Lovett and her daughter Lexie.

Picture: ABC Source: ABC\n“So the contract stipulates that the siblings and families get together once a year, and I hope they honour that. I mean, it is yet to be tested.”\nShe also wants embryo recipients with a tertiary education but none with extended family members who have had addictions.\n“It’s hard for a lot of people to understand, and it’s definitely not a cult, but she would like Lexie to have an extended family,” Ms Lovett’s sister Amanda Lovett-Jones says.\nMs Lovett has three embryo recipients so far and two are now pregnant.\nMs Lovett used donor sperm and donor eggs to create Lexie. Picture: ABC Source: ABC\nAustralian Story follows one of the recipients, a South Australian woman as she tries to get pregnant using two of Lovett’s American embryos.\n“I think baby lust is very strong and very powerful, and so people desperately want to become parents,” Kate Bourne from the Victorian Assisted Reproductive Treatment Authority says in tonight’s episode.\n“Some people will go to great lengths to travel anywhere to meet that need.”\nAustralian Story: Lexie’s Village airs at 8pm on ABC TV.\nOriginally published as Mum gives away designer babies — on one condition", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/09/14/1227527/030216-25e5dbf4-5a8d-11e5-82be-38282d6ee84e.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/parenting/sydney-mother-reveals-unusual-plan-to-give-away-spare-embryos/story-fnet08xa-1227527031780", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/09/14/1227527/031699-277c9598-5a8d-11e5-82be-38282d6ee84e.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/09/14/1227527/030243-20d13b5e-5a8d-11e5-82be-38282d6ee84e.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-15T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T16:09:13.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
