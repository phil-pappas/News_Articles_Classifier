We are talking over our day spent at the Slave Market Memorial: rubbing our stiff necks, recalling how we filed, stooping, through oppressively low cells where the slaves had been penned. Words failed as we’d stood beside the pit containing three life‑size statues in original shackles. Zanzibar does not hide its history as a slave trading island. • Readers' tips: the best holidays in Africa Exhibits show clearly how tribes from the east and south of Africa sold neighbouring tribesmen into the Arab and Indian markets in Stonetown, while so many others from the north and west of the continent ended up on sugar plantations in the West Indies. Stonetown on Zanzibar: the island used to be a slave trading centre (AP) Photo: AP We are distracted, however, by happy shouts drifting up from the harbour, followed by clapping and cheering. The older boys are showing off noisily with experimental leaps from the wall into the water a couple of feet below. Their enthusiasm is infectious. All along the harbour wall the local boys are gathering in impromptu diving competitions. The older boys are showing off noisily with experimental leaps from the wall into the water a couple of feet below. Their enthusiasm is infectious and we cheer when two boys manage to synchronise their dives. Then one teenager raises the stakes yet again as he swaggers up and arcs a graceful loop into the sea. Cannons the length of the harbour wall are the perfect vantage point for children to scramble up and wait their turn, legs dangling. We are buoyed by their exhilaration as the sun sinks slowly into the orangey sea. Behind us a night market is being set up, and the smell of barbecued fish cuts against the sweet cinnamon-clove air that is so distinctive here. Paraffin lamps glow gently over the market stalls already piled with fresh fish, pineapples, coconuts and spices. A man sharpens his panga to hack some sugar cane into chewable sticks. Markets set up on Zanzibar as the sun sets Photo: AP This is a feast for locals and tourists alike. Everyone is enjoying the atmosphere, a hum of voices punctuated by the splashes from the children still perfecting their stunts in the dying light. The queue moves quickly and we point out the bits of fish we would like off the barbecue, unable to say anything in Swahili except “Asante sana” (“thank you”). The man grins as he parcels up the soft fish with rice and cloves. We wander back with our hot packages to perch on the harbour wall, and inhale the fragrances before we eat. The sun has set over the sea towards Tanzania , putting an end to the diving games. We meander back past the House of Wonders: what a magical name for the cultural museum. It has been a memorable evening, all the better because it followed that harsh history lesson earlier today.
