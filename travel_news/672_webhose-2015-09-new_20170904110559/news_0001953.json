(\"La Quinta\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: LQ) today announced that its Board of Directors has approved a program to repurchase an aggregate of up to $100 million of the Company's common stock, effective immediately. The Company had previously announced a $200 million program which would commence once the Company's net debt to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA ratio falls below 4.0 times. However, given recent market activity, the Company and the Board of Directors have decided to accelerate a portion of the program.\n\"Enhancing returns for our shareholders is an important focus for La Quinta and by returning capital to our shareholders, we are executing on this key strategy,\" said Keith A. Cline , interim President & Chief Executive Officer of La Quinta. \"We believe investing in our stock at this time is a wise use of our capital and, as such, our Board of Directors has approved an acceleration of a portion of our previously announced share repurchase program so that we can take advantage of current market conditions.\"\nThe share repurchase of $100 million is expected to be funded by up to a $30 million draw on the Company's revolver, with the remainder from available cash. As a result, the Company expects that its net debt to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA ratio will remain above the Company's previously stated target of 4.0 times. The Company expects to execute the repurchases, depending on conditions, in open market transactions or in negotiated transactions off the market.\n2015 Financial Guidance Update\nThe Company is also revising its 2015 financial guidance as a result of weaker than anticipated hotel demand during August and September and industry trends which indicate weaker demand for the portfolio for the remainder of the year. Additionally, the Company will incur a charge of approximately $11 million related to executive separation, which is excluded from Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA.\nUpdated Guidance\nPrior Guidance\nRevPAR growth on a system-wide comparable hotel basis\n3.5 percent to 4.5 percent\n4.5 percent to 5.5 percent\nPro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\n$393 million to $400 million\n$398 million to $404 million\nInterest expense\nApproximately $87 million\nApproximately $87 million\nFranchise hotel openings\n50 to 55\n50 to 55\nWeighted average shares of common stock outstanding\nApproximately 131.7 million\nApproximately 131.7 million\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\") and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
