Across the country, women submitted toasts about their friendships and explained why their group of friends should be chosen to win the ultimate getaway to the Korbel Winery in Sonoma County , CA.\nOf all the entries, Karen Gilliam , from Baltimore, MD , shared a toast about the special friendship she has with her \"sisters of love\" who formed an unbreakable bond in elementary school. Gilliam said their sisterhood lives on years later as each of the women toast to their 50 th birthdays this year. Through the good, the bad and the ugly, Gilliam said the women have never wavered in their love for one another and are blessed to have this gift of sisterhood.\n\"My girlfriends and I toast life and our friendship every day,\" said Gilliam. \"What better way to celebrate our 50 th birthdays than with Korbel California Champagne and its first class team!\"\nGilliam and her four best friends – Travia Baker , Cathy Davis , Valerie Magoulakis and Jesselyn McCurdy - received four days of VIP treatment at the Korbel Winery. The trip included airfare and accommodations along with behind-the-scenes winery tours, gourmet meals prepared by the winery chefs and poolside spa treatments at the winery.\n\" Korbel is delighted to join in the celebration of this group's lifelong friendship,\" said Gary Heck , owner and president of Korbel Champagne Cellars. \" Korbel is raising a glass to not only these relationships, but the many milestones they've crossed, including the celebration of their 50 th birthdays this year.\"\nEstablished in 1882 in Sonoma County's Russian River Valley , Korbel Champagne Cellars produces the United States' most popular méthode champenoise champagne. But the true measure of Korbel's success during its 133 years can be seen in the impact it's had on American consumers and its presence at various celebrations throughout the years. Owned and managed by the Heck family since 1954, Korbel currently makes eleven California champagnes and a limited amount of still wine. In a separate facility Korbel also produces one of the country's most respected brandies.\nCelebrate responsibly.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150831/262586\n releases/korbel-california-champagne-toasts-to-fabulous-friends-celebrating-fifty-years-with-exclusive-winery-trip-300135610.html\n ", "external_links": ["https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150831/262586", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=SF90880&Transmission_Id=201509010600PR_NEWS_USPR_____SF90880&DateId=20150901", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/korbel-california-champagne-toasts-to-fabulous-friends-celebrating-fifty-years-with-exclusive-winery-trip-300135610.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150831/262586"], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T14:00:28.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
