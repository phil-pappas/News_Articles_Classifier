In August, Haggen said it would close or seek to sell at least 27 stores. Unions filed grievances and complained that Haggen had failed to live up to its promises to the employees of its newly acquired stores.\nHaggen was also sued for $41.1 million by Albertsons, which claimed it hadn’t been paid for inventory at some of the stores Haggen acquired.\nIn Tuesday’s lawsuit, Haggen says Albertsons used what it knew about the timing of store transitions to run ad campaigns and discounts to steal away customers to stores that still bore the Albertsons and Safeway brands.\nHaggen also says that Albertsons gave it misleading price information about products on the shelves before the transition, resulting in the prices that turned off many customers as soon as the rebranded stores opened their doors.\n“The practical result of this deception was a consumer walking into a brand new Haggen store and finding the same item on the same shelf, but now priced higher than it was immediately before store conversion,” the lawsuit says.\nMoreover, says the suit, Albertsons gave Haggen muddled inventory data, and understocked some stores to ensure disruption while overstocking others with perishable products. In a few instances, Albertsons charged purchases to a soon-to-be converted store and had them delivered to another store it was keeping, the suit alleges.\nAlbertsons also dialed down ad campaigns for some soon-to-be-converted stores a few weeks before they were to change hands, undermining customer loyalty, Haggen says.\nThose practices damaged Haggen’s operations from the get-go, leading to store closures it had never intended to make, as well as a barrage of negative press, the lawsuit says.\nThe result, Haggen says, is less competition and more power for Albertsons, violating the Federal Trade Commission’s intent when it ordered it to get rid of hundreds of stores.\nAlbertsons didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe lawsuit outlines how Haggen executives met with Albertsons counterparts at that company’s headquarters in Boise, Idaho, last November. The Albertsons executives sought to convince Haggen of the technical feasibility of a seamless transition for the stores.\nKey to that transition was the implementation of business processing software that would help Haggen get the data it needed. Albertson promised its support, but later didn’t provide it, the lawsuit says.\nHaggen struck a deal in December to buy 146 stores for more than $300 million, plus inventory, subject to Federal Trade Commission approval. The FTC granted its blessing in January.\n“Had Haggen known Albertsons’ true intentions, Haggen would never have purchased the stores, nor would the FTC have permitted such a purchase,” the lawsuit says.\nThe lawsuit says Albertsons’ violations of antitrust laws entitle Haggen to triple damages of at least $1 billion, plus attorneys’ fees.\nÁngel González: 206-464-2250 or agonzalez@seattletimes.com .
