The vibrant restaurant and bar, with its design and gourmet roots proudly set in the golden era of 1920s Brussels, will once again add a touch of vintage glamour to Dubai’s burgeoning brunch scene.\nA sharing concept, food is served to the table, with guests enjoying a decadent stream of classic Belgian cuisine. The lavish brunch begins with the show-stopping signature fruits de mer (seafood platter), piled high with fresh lobster, oysters and winkles, served with a side of creamy Belgian mayonnaise, followed by an array of hors d’oeuvres, main courses and desserts.\nThe menu will feature a variety of new dishes, such as soft poached egg with garden peas, beef bacon and potato truffle puree, salmon cakes with remoulade sauce, and pistachio pain de gêne with poached pear and white chocolate spaghetti, along with a selection of Café Belge favorites, including pan seared seabass, beef chateaubriand and chocolate cremeaux with speculoos donut.\nGuests can enjoy brunch inside the elegant restaurant, marveling at the striking Art Deco and Art Nouveau style décor, or outside on the spacious terrace, whilst 1920s flair comes in the form of a DJ playing an eclectic mix of upbeat jazz.\nChef’s Picks\nTo mark the new season, Trevor Macleod, Chef de Cuisine, Café Belge, shares his must-try dishes from the new brunch menu:\nTomato & Sea Asparagus Salad with Fresh Tarragon & Sirop de Liège dressing\nThis refreshing salad is made with Kumato tomatoes, a unique variety grown in Belgium and other parts of Europe, complemented by the Sirop de liege dressing, a thick syrup from the Belgian town of Liege, made from evaporated apple and pear juices.\nAsparagus a la Flamande “Modern”\nChef Trevor’s version of a traditional Belgian classic, ‘asparagus a la flamande’; the classic grated egg is replaced with a poached egg that has been breaded and fried, and instead of the classic melted butter with lemon juice, Trevor serves a lemon butter espuma, topped with smoked croutons.\nCafé Belge Mini Wagyu Burgers\nThe signature Wagyu burger has been given a makeover for the new season, and is now even more delicious thanks to an additional ingredient stacked inside; slices of potato, slowly cooked in duck fat, garlic and onion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T19:03:36.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
