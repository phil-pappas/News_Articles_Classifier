On the Pascack Valley Line, one late night/early morning train with light ridership is being eliminated following a decision by NJ TRANSIT in July to implement a series of service changes, but alternative options exist for those customers who had used it.\nPort Jervis Line\nA new train will depart Hoboken at 2:41 p.m. and runs express to Suffern, N.Y., after making just one stop, at Secaucus Junction, where customers can connect from the 2:29 p.m. train from Penn Station. After stopping at Suffern, the train makes all local stops to Middletown/Town of Wallkill, where it is scheduled to arrive at 4:19 p.m.\nThe addition of the new train eliminates the current timetable’s gap of 2 hours and 55 minutes that exists between the departures of trains that leave Hoboken at 1:23 p.m. and 4:18 p.m. It also represents a 7.7% increase in the number of northbound Port Jervis Line trains, which rises to 14 per weekday, from 13.\n“We added this new train so that our Orange County and Rockland County customers who use the Port Jervis Line would be able to have the confidence that they’ll never have to wait more than two hours to catch a train during the mid-day period,” said Joseph Giulietti, President of MTA Metro-North Railroad. “This is designed to help folks who might have to travel unexpectedly during the work day, or our customers who have unconventional work hours.”\nTo make room for this new train, the 1:13 p.m. train to Middletown will depart Hoboken 31 minutes earlier, at 12:42 p.m. That train will connect at Secaucus Junction with the 12:37 p.m. departure from Penn Station.\nPascack Valley Line\nThe last outbound weekday train, which departs Hoboken at 12:45 a.m., will no longer operate on Monday-Thursday nights.\nTo help some of the customers who may have used that train, the 10:42 p.m. train from Hoboken, which connects at Secaucus with the 10:35 p.m. train from Penn Station, will depart from Hoboken 31 minutes later, at 11:13 p.m. It will connect at Secaucus with a train that leaves Penn Station at 11:06 p.m.\nAnd the departure time of another late-night train is being moved back about 30 minutes. The last Hoboken-bound weekday train will operate approximately 30 minutes later, departing Spring Valley at 12:05 a.m.\nFor those customers of the 12:45 a.m. train looking for alternative travel arrangements, the following late-night services are available:\nCoach USA’s Route 11A to Pearl River, Nanuet and Spring Valley from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan departs at 12:15 a.m., arriving at Pearl River Town Center at 1:25 a.m., Nanuet Mall at 1:35 a.m. and Spring Valley Station at 1:47 a.m.\nSource:- MTA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T09:07:59.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
