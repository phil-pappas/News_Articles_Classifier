Donkeys and sheep graze the fields, doves coo from the surrounding woodland, deer and foxes are frequently seen. Hornstone is the largest cottage, sleeping six and offering the best outlook. Bigger groups could take two or more cottages – in total there is accommodation for 20. Location 9/10 Westley Farm cottages, Chalford Between Cirencester and Stroud, you turn off the busy A419 and find yourself in a magical valley. Should you care to explore further afield, Minchinhampton, three miles away, is a quintessential Cotswold town, while Cirencester (8 miles) and Stroud (14 miles) offer fantastic museums – of Roman Britain and local life, respectively. Style/character 8/10 This is the real deal of a rural haven: five comfy cottages with simple furnishings and a terrific pastoral setting. They are run as sustainably as possible (not that guests are expected to follow suit other than using the Ecover washing up liquid supplied), and they are wonderfully pretty without being done up to the nines. Hornstone has a large kitchen with old-fashioned dresser, basic oven and wooden dining table. Its sitting room is snug rather than markedly stylish. The bathroom and master bedroom, both on the ground floor, are understated, as are the two twin-bedded rooms upstairs. The outdoors is stunning ‒ the cottage offers stupendous views over fields and woodland. Facilities 7/10 There are log fires to light and board games to play on rainy days; kitchens are adequately supplied ‒ although laundry facilities are communal and there are no freezers or dishwashers; sitting rooms have television and DVD players, but otherwise tech and gadgets are few and far between.
