Patel, Rakesh Mishra, Pravin Darad, Minister Jean Paul Adam & President James Michel   \nPresident James Michel of the Seychelles took delivery of a digitally-controlled music recording studio as he was in Mumbai on the last leg of his State Visit to India. President Michel said that he wanted to ensure that the young performing artists are helped to launch their first music album, and it was for this in mind that he welcomed the donation of the recording studio that will be attached to the Department of Culture. \nIn the presence of Minister Alain St.Ange, the Seychelles Minister responsible for Tourism and Culture, the Seychelles President accepted the donation from Mr. K.K. Patel and Mr. Pravin Darad of Allied Builders, and Mr. Rakesh Mishra, the Seychelles Cultural Ambassador based in Mumbai, who coordinated the sourcing and purchase of the music recording studio. Also present at the handing over ceremony that took place during the tourism press conference in Mumbai were Ministers Joel Morgan and Jean-Paul Adam. \n\"Seychelles is today on its way to have a music stadium right in the heart of Victoria. This is a clear demonstration that the development of culture in the islands is, more than ever before, being positioned to be at the center of our country's development. When we place culture at the center of our development, we are in fact placing the people of Seychelles at the center of our development, because we have no culture without our people. It was for this reason that we needed more support to get our younger generation to develop their talent which is why we at the Ministry responsible for Culture are thankful that President Michel has managed to source out a new and digitally-controlled music recording studio for our ministry,\" said Minister St.Ange. \nThe Minister also used the press conference in Mumbai to thank Mr. Roy Kinnear, the CEO of Air Seychelles, for shipping the equipment to Seychelles from India. \n\"The equipment as a whole has now landed in Seychelles and was handed over to Ms. Benjamine Rose, the PS for Culture, who is now organizing to have it set up,\" said Minister St.Ange. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
