Thursday September 10 Man City v Liverpool (19.00) FA Women's Super League, BT Sport 1 VM 530/527 HD, 19.00 With Chelsea flying away at the top of the early Women’s Super League table it’s been a tough 2015 so far for the other big hitters in the league. City are still in touch, five points back, but Liverpool are already ten adrift and need to string a winning run together. Friday September 11 Inverness CT v Hearts (19.45), Scottish Premiership, BT Sport 1 VM 530/527 HD, 19.30 Hearts are back, proving that a drop into the division below, if used to get your act together, isn’t always the worst thing in the world when you’ve been struggling to tread water for a while. Their year away from the Premiership was well spent – no longer weighed down by Vladimir Romanov’s ludicrous chairmanship, a managerial team of Craig Levein as director of football and Robbie Neilson as head coach has overseen five wins from five played at the start of this season to top the fledgling table. Inverness have punched above their weight at this level for several years now but have started slowly with just two points. Big chance to make it six from six. Reading v Ipswich Town (20.00) Championship, Sky Sports 5 VM 516/506, 20.00 If you thought Mick McCarthy carting his island of misfit toys all the way to the play-offs last season on a budget not a great deal bigger than what some Waitrose attendees spend on their weekly shop, then potentially you aint seen nothing yet. A typical summer of scratching around for the likes of Jonathan Dougles and Brett Pitman later and Ipswich are top of the league and unbeaten in four matches so far. Reading still look a long way shy of their former glories so there’s a chance to put a televised marker down here, and for Big Mick to no doubt get really carried away with it all and make some grand promises afterwards, as is his way. Others: Borussia Monchengladbach v Hamburg (19.30), German Bundesliga, BT Sport Europe VM 532/529 HD, 19.30 Mouscron-Peruwelz v Club Brugge (19.30) Belgian Jupiler League, Premier Sports VM 551, 19.30 Levante v Sevilla (19.30) Spanish La Liga, Sky Sports 2 VM 513/503 HD, 19.00 Saturday September 12 Everton v Chelsea (12.45) Premier League, BT Sport 1 VM 530/527 HD, 12.00 Chelsea, thirteenth at the time of writing, are obviously in a false league position but should have just enough about them to survive. Cap tip to Danny Baker for that one. Jose Mourinho often seems to struggle a little in his third season at clubs, often ending with a dramatic flounce away from the whole thing at the end of it. Possibly that's because three years of listening to Mourinho is enough for even his favourite players to be sick of him. Having spent the whole summer flagrantly, publicly, trying to tap up and unsettle John Stones – Gary Cahill and John Terry both casually, openly discussing where he'd fit in the set up in press conferences – Everton are exactly what they don't need to be facing right now: a decent team, bearing a grudge, on their own patch. Man Utd v Liverpool (17.30) Premier League, Sky Sports 1 VM 512/502 HD, 17.00 Another £115m spent on the team this summer, to go with the £145m lavished on it last summer, and you can't help but wonder whether Man Utd are actually a great deal better than when Louis Van Gaal arrived. Mind you, £69m recouped this summer and £25m last year is worth mentioning, because if we've learnt anything from Arsenal Fan TV (quite a short list if I'm honest) it's that you \"need to talk about net spend\". Anyway, all eyes on the goalkeeping selection here after a frantic deadline day at Old Trafford. And on Monaco youngster Anthony Martial who seems a little steep at £36m , though I'm not sure it's entirely fair – or at all relevant – for Sky Sports News to wheel out an \"expert gamer\" to say he'd completed 10 seasons on Football Manager and Martial had averaged only 6.36 and ended up in League One at Burnley. Ten seasons into my last attempt at Football Manager I got to the UEFA Cup final with Scunthorpe United. Liverpool, three clean sheets in their first three games, lost 3-0 at home to West Ham before the international break. Heaven only knows which Brendan Rodgers \"collective unit of men together\" will turn up for this one. QPR v Nottingham Forest (12.30) Championship, Sky Sports 1 VM 512/502 HD, Sky Sports 5 VM 516/506 HD, 12.00 The Financial Fair Play derby. Forest have been inflicted with a transfer embargo, initially total and then partial, for the best part of 18 months since breaking the unwieldy, almost certainly unsafe, rules imposed on Championship clubs. Stars like Michael Antonio have left without adequate replacement. QPR also broke the rules, to the tune of about £60m, the last time they were at this level but are currently in negotiations with the Football League about a proportionate fine with the league keen to avoid a court case that could see the rules wiped out completely. Meanwhile Rangers, unlike Forest, have been signing players – for less money, on lower wages, with better fitness records, and at a younger age, than the riotously expensive gang of pensioners they put together two years ago but, still, can't imagine Forest have taken this very well. A very modern day football rivalry. Others: New York Red Bulls v Chicago Fire (00.00) US MLS, Sky Sports 1 VM 512/502 HD, 00.00 Liverpool U18 v Derby County U18 (12.00) U18 Premier League, LFCTV VM 544, 12.00 Aberdeen v Celtic (12.30) Scottish Premiership, Sky Sports 2 VM 513/503 HD, 12.00 Newtown AFC v Rhyl (17.15) Welsh Premier League, S4C VM 167, 17.00 Sporting Gijon v Valencia (17.15) Spanish La Liga, Sky Sports Red Button, 17.15 Eintracht Frankfurt v FC Cologne (17.30) German Bundesliga, BT Sport Europe VM 532/529 HD, 17.00 FC Twente v Ajax (18.45) Dutch Eredivisie, Sky Sports Red Button, 18.45 FC Basel v St Gallen (19.00) Swiss Super League, BT Sport Extra VM Red Button, 19.00 Atletico Madrid v Barcelona (19.30) Spanish La Liga, Sky Sports 2 VM 513/503 HD, 19.30 Cambuur Leeuwarden v PSV Eindhoven (19.45) Dutch Eredivisie, Sky Sports 5 VM 516/506 HD, 19.30 Real Betis v Real Sociedad (21.00) Spanish La Liga, Sky Sports Red Button, 21.00 Sunday September 13 Sunderland v Tottenham Hotspur (13.30) Premier League, Sky Sports 1 VM 512/502 HD, 13.00 Two clubs who could scarcely have had worse summers had they deliberately set out to sabotage their own Premier League seasons. Sunderland, lucky to escape last year, already making Dick Advocaat wish he'd listened to his wife and retired on a high with a recruitment drive that has left them with a night terror-inducing centre half combination of Younes Kaboul and Sebastian Coates. Still, it's giving Gary Neville something to talk about. Tottenham have found that the looming, grotesque television deal is enabling the mid-range clubs to say 'no'. The asking price is the asking price now, so the usual trick of unsettling a player and making several derisory offers right on the deadline didn't snare them Saido Berahino. The striker's Twitter rant was an amateur standard tantrum – he should have walked up to White Hart Lane and banged on the doors. West Brom always respond really well to that, just as Peter Odemwingie. So that leaves Harry Kane, and Emmanuel Adebayor who's only any use when Jesus and the voices in his tiny mind tell him it's ok to go out and play some football for his £100,000 a week. Fulham v Blackburn Rovers (12.00) Championship, Sky Sports 5 VM 516/506 HD, 12.00 What do you do when you pay £11m for a Championship striker and known scorer of goals at the level, skewing the entire middle tier of the transfer market in the process (\"if Ross McCormack's worth £11m than my player is worth…\"), and then find yourself fending off similarly ludicrous £10m deadline day bids for him from newly minted Sheffield Wednesday? Why, play him in midfield of course. A chance to check out how that's working for manager Kit Symons here against a Blackburn side suffering from a prolonged talent drain. Others: FC Dallas v New York City FC (01.30) US MLS, Sky Sports 2 VM 513/503 HD, 01.00 Granada v Villarreal (11.00) Spanish La Liga, Sky Sports 3 VM 514/504 HD, 11.00 Chelsea U21 v Man Utd U21 (13.00) U21 Premier League, MUTV VM 526, 13.00 Gazalec Ajaccio v Monaco (13.00) French Ligue 1, BT Sport Extra VM Red Button, 13.00 Standard Liege v KSC Lokeren (13.30) Belgian Jupiler League, Premier Sports VM 551, 13.30 Liverpool U21 v Middlesbrough U21 (14.00) U21 Premier League, LFCTV VM 544, 14.00 Hoffenheim v Werder Bremen (14.30) German Bundesliga, BT Sport Europe VM 532/529 HD, 14.30 Athletic Bilbao v Getafe (15.00) Spanish La Liga, Sky Sports 3 VM 514/504 HD, 15.00 Leicester City v Aston Villa (16.00) Premier League, Sky Sports 1 VM 512/502 HD, 15.30 Nantes v Rennes (16.00) French Ligue 1, BT Sport 2 VM 532/528 HD, 16.00 Schalke 04 v Mainz (16.30) German Bundesliga, BT Sport Europe VM 532/529 HD, 15.30 Celta Vigo v Las Palmas (17.15) Spanish La Liga, Sky Sports Red Button, 17.15 Malaga v Eibar (19.30), Spanish La Liga, Sky Sports 4 VM 515/505 HD Marseille v Bastia (20.00) French Ligue 1, BT Sport 1 VM 530/527 HD, 20.00 Toronto FC v New England Revolution (22.00) US MLS, Sky Sports 5 VM 516/506 HD, 22.00 Monday September 14 West Ham v Newcastle United (20.00) Premier League, Sky Sports 1 VM 512/502 HD, 19.00 West Ham's bipolar start to the season – wins at Arsenal and Liverpool, home defeats to Leicester and Bournemouth – had them twitching on deadline day and hurrying another four players in through the entrance door. They include, among their number, Chelsea's Victor Moses who, after three years and just 27 starts for his parent club decided to sign a new four year contract at Stamford Bridge. That'll be another four season long loans at other clubs then Victor will it? The Nigerian is one of 33 players currently loaned out by Chelsea, who continue to hoard talent they never have any intention of using, purely to stop other title and European rivals getting their hands on them. And the best solution the FA can come up with for this is to introduce B Teams – i.e. another non-competitive place to park them all. Newcastle, tragically from a neutral's perspective, are without the suspended Aleksander Mitrovic. His one-man wrecking ball mission got him a red card against Arsenal at the third time of asking, so no need for West Ham's full suit of armour fourth kit here. Others: St Pauli v MSV Duisburg (19.15) German Bundesliga 2, BT Sport Europe VM 532/529 HD, 19.15 Rayo Vallecano v Deportivo La Coruna (19.30), Spanish La Liga, Sky Sports 3 VM 514/504 HD, 19.30 Tuesday September 15 Man City v Juventus (19.45) UEFA Champions League Group Stage, BT Sport Europe VM 532/529 HD, 19.00 Man City have started the Premier League season in flying form, continuing this recent odd pattern of having one season on followed by one season off since the money arrived from the east. What has remained consistent to this point is an inability to perform well and win games regularly in the Champions League. Juventus, Seville and Borussia Mönchengladbach is a group to be filed under ‘tricky’ rather than ‘death’ but it remains to be seen how heavy Manuel Pellegrini’s side find the going. PSV Eindhoven v Man Utd (19.45) UEFA Champions League Group Stage, BT Sport 2 VM 532/528 HD, 19.00 Manchester United may have been away from the competition for a year, but their ability to pop up in the weakest group remains strong. They start at PSV with Kevin De Bruyne-less Wolfsburg still to come, and two matches against CSKA Moscow as well. Mind you, the way they’re playing, you wouldn’t be putting League Cup games at Crewe down as a gimme just at the moment.
