Flights And Jobs For Qantaslink\nQantas today announced it will add more services between Hobart and east coast cities next year, with flights conveniently timed to benefit business travellers and customers connecting to Qantas international routes.\nFrom 8 March 2016, QantasLink will operate a total of 46 return services per week from Hobart to Sydney and Melbourne, up from 35 services currently.\nQantasLink CEO John Gissing said the additional services were in response to market demand – both in terms of overall capacity and time of day.\n“Our new schedule offers more options for QantasLink flights throughout the day, with early morning flights delivering customers to Sydney or Melbourne early enough for a full day of business meetings,” Mr Gissing said.\n“The additional 11 return services per week add an extra 2,420 seats to-and-from Hobart on our two-class Boeing 717 jet aircraft.\n“Customers travelling to or from Qantas’ international destinations, such as Shanghai, Los Angeles, Tokyo and Johannesburg, will now have shorter connection times in Sydney and Melbourne.\n“It also means there’s even more choice for Qantas customers wanting to holiday in Tasmania.”\nThe increase in flying also means an increase in jobs, with an additional 10 pilots and 15 cabin crew required at the Hobart base to operate the flights, which will almost double the current workforce.\nPremier of Tasmania and Minister for Tourism, Hospitality and Events Will Hodgman welcomed the increased services and additional jobs.\n“As an island state, Tasmania depends on reliable and regular access to support the growth of our tourism industry,” Premier Hodgman said.\n“For decades Qantas has played an instrumental role growing tourism in Tasmania and today’s announcement shows its commitment to continue this for years to come.\n“The additional flights and almost doubling of the workforce are an enormous vote of confidence in Tasmania’s thriving tourism industry, which is attracting a record number of visitors, and our strengthening economy.\n“We look forward to continuing to work with Qantas to give even more travelers a chance to visit Tasmania, a must-see destination.”\nQantasLink recently announced it had invested in two additional two-class B717s to enable the extra flights, which will bring the total fleet to 20.\nThe two-class aircraft are configured with 12 business and 98 economy seats and are fitted with Q Streaming inflight entertainment enabling customers to stream 400 hours of content to their own personal device via the new Qantas Entertainment App.\nLast year, Qantas made Hobart the home of its premium call centre where it employs more than 300 consultants.\nQantasLink also operates flights into Devonport and Launceston, while Jetstar operates more than 70 return services per week from Hobart to Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, as well as 49 weekly return services from Launceston to Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.\nSchedule commencing 8 March 2016\nHobart – Sydney Flights Dep Arr Frequency Aircraft QF1582 Hobart – Sydney 0635 0820 Monday – Saturday B717 QF1584 Hobart – Sydney 1530 1715 Daily B717
