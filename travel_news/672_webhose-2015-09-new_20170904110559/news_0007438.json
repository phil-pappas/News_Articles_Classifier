Check this out! Published on : Saturday, September 12, 2015\nTeleTrip, the world’s first virtual travel company, announced today that it is partnering with the Museum of Science & Industry (MOSI) in Tampa, Florida to offer remote telepresence access to MOSI exhibits to people around the world.\nMOSI is the largest science center in the Southeast, which serves the greater Tampa Bay area and, as of today, the entire world. Among their current exhibit offerings, MOSI features an innovative look at robotic technologies including the first ever publicly accessible driverless car, drones and other forms of Telepresence robots. With TeleTrip, people anywhere will be able to view the more than 450 exhibits at MOSI and remotely access a telepresence robot located inside the museum.\n“With TeleTrip providing the technology, MOSI can open its doors to anyone with an internet connection. This is an extraordinary opportunity to spread MOSI’s mission – to make science real for people of all ages and backgrounds – to every corner of the globe,” said Molly Demeulenaere, MOSI’s president and CEO. “With this new level of global accessibility, we hope to not only entertain, but educate guests who may not otherwise have the chance to visit the science center in their lifetime.”\nTeleTrip gives people the opportunity to explore attractions all over the world using telepresence controllable robots. Each controllable robot allows anyone, anywhere, to visit a foreign city, attend a remote event or conference, see the best museums or sites, and experience the wonders of the world in an immersive way.\nTeleTrip devices are currently located at tourist sites in New York City, like Times Square, the Brooklyn Bridge and Central Park, with locations being added daily including museums, boutique stores and art galleries. Users pay a small per-minute fee to access robots on the TeleTrip network that covers the cost of the robots and goes to support the host sites. TeleTrip is launching on Kickstarter and backers will be able to explore all the locations, including MOSI.\n“We want to give anyone, living anywhere, no matter what their circumstances, instant access to explore and experience cool places around the world,” said Brian Maxwell, travel enthusiast and founder of TeleTrip. “We’re very excited to be working with MOSI, allowing people from all over the planet to explore the museum with the click of a button. MOSI is a world-class museum and more people should have the opportunity to see it. Those who can’t make the trip to Tampa now have that chance using TeleTrip.”\nBeyond the remote video experience, TeleTrip also allows viewers to move around, pan, tilt, view and hear everything in each location. As a one-to-one experience, virtual travelers can interact with their surroundings and guests within the museum.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T10:58:01.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
