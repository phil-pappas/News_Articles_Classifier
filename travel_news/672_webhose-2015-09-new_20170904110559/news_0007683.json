We’ve all had to deal with annoying seatmates. Source: Getty Images \nWE’VE all been there before: you’re just trying to survive a long, gruelling flight but you’re stuck next to an annoying or plain rude passenger who’s getting on your nerves. \nGeorge Hobica, the founder of travel advice website Airfarewatchdog.com and a frequent traveller, knows this feeling well. Here, he dishes on three of his most memorable experiences with fellow passengers and what we can learn from them. \n• Flight 1: Los Angeles to New York on American Airlines, business class \nLo and behold, there’s an empty seat next to me as the door is about to close. Pure bliss. But what’s this, a kerfuffle in economy? \nSomeone isn’t happy and is letting the cabin crew know about it in no uncertain terms. Angry voices waft over the boarding music. A gate agent and a flight attendant appear at my row. \nGate agent: “Is this seat occupied?” \nMe (crestfallen): “Um, Noooo….” \nGate agent: “Well, I need to upgrade someone.” \nFlight attendant: “Shouldn’t we upgrade 32C? \nGate agent: “I am NOT rewarding that kind of behaviour with an upgrade!” (Her exact words.) \nI’m guessing that 32C had some kind of status. Or felt he did. \nSo who got the upgrade? An 18-year-old student, who, I later learned, volunteered to change his seat to settle whatever dispute was going on back there. He had never flown in business or first class in his life. \nStudent, after the flight attendant pours Lanson Champagne: “Dude, how much does this cost?” \nMe: “It’s free.” \nStudent: “Free? As much as you want free?” \nMe: “Yup, free. Enjoy!” \nDuring the flight, a couple of flight attendants stopped by to thank him profusely for being such a trooper. \nStudent, sotto voce, as a passenger (tank top, tattoos, gym shorts, baseball-cap-on-backward) strolls past us to use the business class lavatory: “That’s the jerk who gave the flight attendants a hard time.” Yup, it’s 32C. \nLesson: People really do get upgraded just for being nice. Jerks sometimes don’t. Be nice if you’re hoping for an upgrade.

Just saying good morning!” \nSeatmate: “ .” \nThree hours into the flight, , after several cocktails, he spills a full cup of hot coffee on my jeans, my seat, my tray table. I’m soaked. My seat is soaked. \nMe: “Ouch!” \nSeatmate: “Oops.” \nI get up for some towels, the crew gives me a pair of Upper Class pyjamas to change into, and puts a blanket on my wet seat. \nSeatmate, upon my return: “So what’s your name?” \nMe: “That’s OK.” \nSeatmate: “No really, what’s your name?” \nMe: “No really, that’s OK.” \nSeatmate: “I’m Robert. What do you do?” \nSuddenly he’s a Chatty Cathy and wants to be best bruhs? He just will not stop. \nMe (exasperated at this point): “Look, I really was just saying hello. Oh, and I told the cabin crew that you’re cut off.” I was in a mood. \nLesson: You only get one chance to make a first impression. Jerk. Another passenger, another day. How not to make a great first impression.

You couldn’t have used the W.C. in the terminal?” \nMe (no longer sweet as pie): “I had a tight connection. Don’t give me that attitude. I didn’t choose the window seat! Get up or I’ll climb over you.” \nAisle Seat: “Harrumph!” (not his exact word but you get the drift). He elevates his rather portly frame. \nMe (20 minutes after takeoff): “I need to get up again” (I didn’t really have to). \nAisle Seat: “Harrumph!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T13:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T15:30:08.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
