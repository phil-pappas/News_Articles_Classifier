The company had debts of 67.5 billion rubles ($1 billion) as of June 30, according to its report for the first half of the year.\nState-controlled Aeroflot told Russia's Interfax news agency that \"Transaero's activities will be restructured and integrated at the operational level.\"\nTransaero and Aeroflot compete on many domestic and international routes, meaning that a takeover may lead to significant duplication.\nAeroflot led Russian airlines by transporting 14.6 million passengers on domestic and international routes in the first seven months of the year, compared to 7.5 million for Transaero, according to Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency. The next biggest airline, S7, transported 4.5 million passengers.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T19:53:40.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
