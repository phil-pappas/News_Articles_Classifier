Passengers are entitled to up to €600 under EU regulation 261 if a flight lands more than three hours late\nThe phrase “extraordinary circumstances” still applies to flights that are affected by severe weather, strikes and political instability.\nThe court ruled that as these situations cannot be reasonably avoided by airlines, then compensation does not have to be paid when they cause cancellations and delays.\n“The airline must ensure the maintenance and proper functioning of all aircraft used for commercial activities. No component of an aircraft is indestructible; these situations are inherent in the normal operations of an airline,” said the court.\n“Therefore, when a flight is cancelled due to unforeseen technical errors, the airline remains obliged to pay compensation to its passengers.”\nLast month, the UK's Civil Aviation Authority enforced legislation to make Aer Lingus, Wizz Air and Jet2 change their compensation policies for delayed and cancelled flights.\nRyanair said it already complied with EU 261 by “accepting technical delay claims and claims made within six years of the date of delay”.\nThe airline added that the Court of Justice ruling would have “less effect on Ryanair than any other EU airline as Ryanair suffers fewer delays and fewer cancelations than any other EU airline”.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BBT_online"], "published": "2015-09-18T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T18:06:31.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
