Certification from the US authorities (FAA) will follow.\nEric Zanin, Airbus Head of the A330 Programme said: “With this new 242t A330-200 our customers will benefit from even more range plus a proven 99.4 percent reliability, while offering their passengers best-in-class comfort. It’s unbeatable operating costs and unique versatility make the A330 Family a highly competitive solution in the medium to long haul market.”\nThe range of the new A330-200 242t increases by up to 350 nautical miles/650 kilometres compared to today’s 238 tonne model, allowing customers to fly missions up to 7,250 nm/ 13,400 km. Thanks to aerodynamic refinements and engine enhancements, operators will reduce their fuel consumption by up two percent.\nLaunched in 2012 and already in service on the larger A330-300 model, the 242 tonne variant is the platform for the A330neo – yet another concrete example of Airbus’ incremental innovation strategy.\nThe A330 Family seats 250 to 300 passengers (in a typical 3 class configuration) and includes Freighter, VIP, and Military Transport/Tanker variants. To date the A330 Family has attracted more than 1,500 orders and around 1,200 A330s are flying worldwide with over 100 operators. Ever since the original A330-300 entered service, its hallmarks are its very efficient operating economics, innovative cabin features, while offering passengers much wider economy-class seats than any competing aircraft. Moreover, with numerous product improvements and with an operational reliability of 99.4 percent, the A330 is the most cost-efficient and capable aircraft in its class.\nSource:- Airbus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T21:10:22.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
