The hugely popular family resort was packed to capacity averaging 100 per cent occupancy on all days of Eid and outperformed the competition in all parameters.\n\nHaytham Aziz, Hotel Manager, Coral Beach Resort Sharjah, said, \"We have had a phenomenal Eid with the property yielding the highest average rates and occupancies in Sharjah. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate our sales and revenue team who have put in a lot of hard-work to deliver these exceptional results. We have always been the most sought-after family destination featuring the finest mix of accommodation, dining and recreation facilities and the recent refurbishment of rooms and various facilities has further enhanced our appeal. Our greatest attraction remains 350 metres of beautiful white, sandy private beach, open daily from sunrise till sunset\". \n\nTalking about the last quarter of 2015, Haytham said, \"It is a peak period of demand for us, therefore, we expect to maintain strong occupancies throughout the season. Our aim is to boost every aspect of the business. Bulk of our bookings comes from the leisure segment, however, we are equally keen to grow our corporate business given the extensive events and meeting facilities at the hotel. In addition to our traditional source markets, we are also looking to drive more business from GCC, India and China. We will also explore the potential of countries such as Iran.\" \n\nAbout Coral Beach Resort Sharjah \nThe Coral Beach Resort Sharjah recently underwent a complete refurbishment of rooms and facilities that has given it a brand new appeal.
