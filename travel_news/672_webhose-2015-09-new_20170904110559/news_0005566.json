To give a new twist to the event, however, on June 16th the exhibition exceptionally moved to the Florence Opera, for the new production of Pelléas et Mélisande by Debussy within the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino schedule.\nThe event therefore falls within the large and well-known Italian musical tradition, known throughout the world, which offers a wide range of musical events for lovers of opera, classical and contemporary music throughout the year. Bologna la Dotta (“Bologna the erudite” as it is often named), the city of art and culture and home of the first Italian university, is one of its ideal locations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T08:23:42.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
