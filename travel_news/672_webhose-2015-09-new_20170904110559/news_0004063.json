This has been corrected.\nThe greenhouse and storage shed at the Franciscan Monastery vegetable garden in Northeast Washington. (Adrian Higgins/The Washington Post) By Adrian Higgins Gardening columnist September 22 at 11:30 AM Follow @adrian_higgins For decades, Washingtonians have enjoyed the formal rose and tropical garden around the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at the Franciscan Monastery in the Northeast neighborhood of Brookland.\nThey may also know the shrines built into the hillside woodland next to it, reminders of the order’s mission to care for Christian sites in the Holy Land.\nAdrian Higgins has been writing about the intersection of gardening and life for more than 25 years, and joined the Post in 1994. He is the author of several books, including the \"Washington Post Garden Book\" and \"Chanticleer, a Pleasure Garden.\" View Archive Mostly hidden from public view, however, is another garden, one for herbs, roses and, increasingly in recent years, vegetable cultivation.\nDoubled in size this year, it now occupies a three-quarter-acre slope between an imposing but tired greenhouse and a large open field below. Its cadre of volunteer gardeners, members of the monastery’s Garden Guild, are on track to harvest a total of 5,000 pounds of produce by the end of the season next month. The food goes to the monastery, where approximately 30 friars and visiting priests live; to other religious communities in Northeast; and to a host of food banks in the city.\nAll this was in the works before Pope Francis issued his environmental encyclical in June whose title, “Laudato Si’ ” (Praise Be to You) comes from a canticle written by Saint Francis of Assisi, the 13th-century founder of the Franciscan order from whom the pope took his name. The saint was famous for rejecting materialism and teaching the divine beauty of the natural world.\nThe gardeners are on track to harvest 5,000 pounds of produce this year for local religious communities and area food banks. (Adrian Higgins/The Washington Post) The encyclical has been framed as the pope’s call to action on climate change , but in its breadth the papal letter links the environmental woes of the planet to a broken human ecosystem. Among the pope’s themes: Technological excess and its exponential change have forced us into a more intense pace of life and work that he argues is exploitative and unsustainable, both for us and the Earth.\nThe pope describes a world where the poor are harmed the most by polluted air and water and climate change while those in wealthier societies fill an inner emptiness with extreme consumerism and the distraction of social media. He asserts that being more connected makes us more isolated.\n“Real relationships with others, with all the challenges they entail, now tend to be replaced by a type of internet communication which enables us to choose or eliminate relationships at whim, thus giving rise to a new type of contrived emotion which has more to do with devices and displays than with other people and with nature,” he writes.\nThis is deep stuff, and not universally accepted . And yet the encyclical seems to resonate loudly in the secluded vegetable plot of the Franciscan Monastery, whose lay gardeners set out to change the world a little and may have changed themselves a lot in the process.\nThe guild was started by a group of older volunteers, many now too infirm to garden hard. They have been succeeded by younger retirees.\nLou Maroulis, the guild’s director, is a 58-year-old refu­gee from the IT world who gardened here for 10 years but has spent the past two growing seasons focused on expanding the size and harvest of the garden.\nThe setting is bucolic — the seven-acre field once pastured the friars’ dairy herd — and the greenhouse is a magnificent 120-foot-long Lord & Burnham glass palace whose grandeur is much faded but very much apparent. Maroulis said being in the pastoral setting of a monastery while still in the city heightens the sense of peace and tranquility here.\nLou Maroulis, left, is the Garden Guild’s director and CEO. Joe Bozik, right, is the treasurer and beekeeper for the monastery's 18-hive apiary. (Adrian Higgins/The Washington Post) “We are all tremendously moved just to be here, and it may be a combination of working with nature and being on the monastery grounds. The combination of the two is extremely powerful, especially with the work we are doing.”\nAs I visited the other day, M.J. Crom and Kevin Longhany of the Capital Area Food Bank arrived in a white pickup truck loaded with purple crates ready to accept the harvest that the gardeners had put aside under the shade of a pear tree.\nWooden trays held many types of tomatoes as well as eggplants, peppers and squash. The organization distributes food to a network of 500 charities. “There are 700,000 people in the D.C. metropolitan area who are food-insecure,” Crom said. Most of the produce is bought from local farms, Longhany said. “There are a few farms where we receive donations, but not very many,” he said. “This is the first time we have come here and we hope not the last.”\nMaroulis said his work in the garden has strengthened his faith and that of those around him. It has certainly established the type of grass-roots charitable community that the encyclical entreats.\nRita Granado, a recent retiree who lives in Silver Spring, is finishing her first season as a volunteer in the garden, which she described as “a slice of heaven.”\nWhen she comes early in the morning, “the birds are chirping. I find a lot of comfort in it. It makes me appreciate life more now, to see a tiny seed grow so big and healthy and the vines producing all these veggies. It’s just awesome.”\nJoe Bozik, the guild’s treasurer, retired from the Energy Department eight years ago and is the resident beekeeper. The garden has a large apiary of 18 beehives, together housing about a million honeybees. The squash, the tomatoes, the eggplant, none of them lack for pollination.\nThe monastery is just outside the orbit of Pope Francis’s visit to Washington this week, which includes a Mass at the nearby Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. The gardeners planned a luminary lighting ceremony in the monastery’s portico to coincide with the pope’s arrival in Washington on Tuesday evening.\nOn Saturday, Bozik will lead a workshop in harvesting honey from the hives, a job that includes putting honeycombed frames in an extractor. “I would love to sit down with the pope to do a honey extraction,” he said. “I don’t think it’s going to happen, but I think he would enjoy that. He seems (to be) such a down-to-earth kind of person.”\nVestiges of Maroulis’s life in the IT world linger in the form of spreadsheets tallying the harvest and scheduling volunteer assignments. But he sees another link between his old job, the monastery garden and the pope’s letter “on care for our common home.”\nIn the IT world, he said, you develop software by creating a prototype to test. “You build a mock-up to review it with your stakeholders and users to make sure this is the direction they want to go in,” he said. “This is what the vegetable garden is, a prototype for the pope’s encyclical.”\n@adrian_higgins on Twitter\nAlso at washingtonpost.com\nRead past columns by Higgins at\nwashingtonpost.com/home .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@adrian_higgins", "http://lordandburnham.com/lord_burnham.html", "http://www.myfranciscan.org/"], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T23:28:36.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
