One minute the tourists are up close...\n... the next they can be seen in the distance (circled in red) surrounded by an iconic piece of Australia\nNow you see them: To take their enormous selfie travellers stand on a designated shooting spot and then use the 'GIGA Selfie' app\nNow you don't! A distant camera then captures the tourists (circled in red) and the surrounding landscape\nThe GIGA selfie campaign hopes to help raise the level of conversation about Australia in Japan and in-turn help to encourage more Japanese travellers to follow in others foot-steps.\nThis new campaign is being promoted across a wide range of mediums across Japan including digital media, TV, newspapers and travel agency activities.\nThe first two opportunities to take a huge selfie will be in Queensland off the Gold Coast on September 5 and 6, from 11 am to 4 pm. Future locations are yet to be determined but will be updated through social media outlets.", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1Vr5RKt", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2015-08-31T18:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:25:47.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
