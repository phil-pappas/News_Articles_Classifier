The footage was captured while two of its reporters were shooting still images and a time lapse video for the magazine. National Geographic/ Instagram \nTourists are captured by a National Geographic time lapse video disturbing a group of manatees in Florida. \n\"We ended up getting a good still image for the magazine but nothing has been nearly effective as driving the debate of wildlife harassment of these manatees than this time lapse.\" the poster wrote. \n\"We were standing on top of an 80 foot tall crane, hanging above the entrance to the Three Sisters Springs in Crystal River, Florida. US Fish and Wildlife and most tour operators have a strict code of ethic to respect the Manatees and maintain a safe distance while the manatees attempt to stay warm. \n\"The perimeter floats are put in place to keep people out but the Manatees go to where the warm water is and not necessarily within the confines of the rope barrier. They are literally trying to stay alive and it is imperative not to disturb them. \nThis image shows the manatees being scared by a loud bang. NatGeo/Instagram \n\"However, it is hard to keep an eye on everyone and many disregard the rules. You c an see people swimming amongst them, grabbing them and even pushing off of them.\" \nThe most disturbing part of the clip comes when the manatees suddenly shoot off in all directions, causing chaos in the water. According to the National Geographic poster, the manatees - also known as \"sea cows\" - were scared after a \"large bang from one of the boats\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T09:37:29.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
