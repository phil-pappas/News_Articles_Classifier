Towering above the northern tip of Staten Island at 630 feet, the New York Wheel will be the tallest observation wheel in the Western Hemisphere and one of New York's great landmark attractions, alongside the Statue of Liberty, Freedom Tower , and the Empire State Building . Upon completion, the New York Wheel is anticipated to draw more than four million visitors each year to the giant observation wheel. \nNCPS will be leading the offering on its affiliated 99Funding marketplace platform, which launched last year as the first online platform for broker-vetted syndicated private offerings. The firm is currently finalizing its syndicate group, which is expected to include up to a dozen other platform partners. The company expects the offering to be completed by year-end. \nJim Dowd , Chief Executive Officer of NCPS, said, \"The New York Wheel will be a spectacular new attraction, and we are excited be leading the equity crowdfunding offering to complement the conventional financing which is already in place. The Wheel will overlook New York harbor and another great landmark, the Statue of Liberty, which was also partially funded through a crowdfunding campaign 130 years ago. The difference is that investors in the New York Wheel will own an equity interest in the project. As a populist attraction with appeal for people from all walks of life, the New York Wheel is well-suited for our network of accredited investors.\" \nRich Marin , CEO of the New York Wheel, said, \"The New York Wheel will attract domestic and global visitors, mature retirees and urban hipsters, residents from New York City and the greater metro area, and broad-based tour participants. Whether you arrive by private launch or on the free Staten Island Ferry, the New York Wheel will have a program and attraction experience for everyone. In the same way, we think a broad array of investors will be interested in the potential returns of this iconic project. We are at the gateway to America, the land of opportunity, and we see this investment as just that kind of opportunity.
