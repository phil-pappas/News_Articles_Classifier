It was the first SUV-like vehicle I recalled offering both all-wheel drive and front-wheel drive, and I thought it was quite silly that anything with an SUV shape could come in a front-wheel-drive (only) layout. Rear-wheel drive, all-wheel drive or 4-wheel drive made sense to my late-20s mind, but a front-wheel drive \"SUV\" seemed like a fraud. \"Who would buy such a vehicle?\" I pondered. Turns out Lexus was precociously correct and I was obsolescently wrong. The Lexus RX has been a consistent sales leader within not only the Lexus model line but across the entire luxury vehicle market. As Lexus officials told us during the 2016 RX introduction, \"The RX is one of only two luxury models to consistently sell in annual volumes above 100,000. The other vehicle being BMW's 3 Series.\" The RX also plays a critical role in Lexus brand's ongoing status as a leader in the residual values we track at Kelley Blue Book . It's actually quite fitting for the RX to rival the 3 Series in annual sales, as I would argue the RX plays as big a role in defining Lexus as the 3 Series plays in defining BMW. It's also widely acknowledged the RX started the luxury SUV/crossover trend, just as the 3 Series started the sport sedan trend. This trend now sees every premium automaker offering multiple utility vehicles, with many of those utes selling in greater volume than their sedan counterparts. Did this put additional pressure on Lexus when it redesigned the RX 350 and RX 450h for 2016? Undoubtedly, which is why the automaker trusted that role to Takayuki Katsuda, the chief engineer with experience in this area (he oversaw the last RX redesign). We spoke with Katsuda and he assured us the new RX balances its longstanding role as a refined luxury crossover with Akio Toyoda's recent desire to infuse greater passion in all Toyota and Lexus vehicles. Terms like, \"dramatic re-imagination\" and \"seductive strength\" were bandied about during the new RX's recent press launch in Portland, Oregon. The official term for Lexus' new exterior design language, characterized by a large spindle grille and distinct body creases, is \"Sophistication with an edge.\" There are certainly plenty of new edges in the 2016 Lexus RX's exterior, a design that has been received with a bit of controversy but one that confirms Lexus' desire to step outside its traditional comfort zone. Lexus officials told us they wanted to maintain the RX's large loyalty base while increasing its appeal with men and its ability to conquest shoppers for competitive luxury crossovers. The RX's more distinctive exterior design, along with available F Sport trims on the RX 350 and (for the first time) the RX 450h hybrid, are meant to achieve those goals. Other big changes for 2016 include LED exterior lighting, a standard 8-speed automatic, more powerful engines, 20-inch wheels on premium trims and a new interior design with more color choices and upgraded technology features. The V6 in the RX 350 now makes 295 horsepower (up from 270 last year) and the RX 450h makes 308 peak horsepower (up from 290). Both models feature a \"Drive Mode Select\" dial in the center console to pick between ECO, Sport and (in F Sport models) Sport+ mode for increased throttle response and quicker steering. We noticed the new RX's improved power and sharper dynamics on the twisty mountain roads outside Portland, particularly on F Sport models in Sport+ drive mode. The word \"fun\" isn't one we previously associated with the RX, but we will going forward. Despite these upgrades in performance the 2016 Lexus RX still delivers increased fuel efficiency, with an estimated 20 city mpg, 28 highway mpg and 23 combined mpg in front-wheel-drive form (19/26/22 mpg in all-wheel drive). The RX 450h now offers 31 city mpg, 30 highway mpg and 30 combined mpg for front-wheel-drive models and 30/28/30 mpg for all-wheel-drive hybrids. The hybrid version continue to use a nickel-metal hydride battery, but it's now 1 inch shorter to take up less cargo space. This model can also be put in \"EV Mode\" and travel up to 20 miles on electricity alone. Credit for the RX's improved fuel efficiency goes to a combination of lightweighting efforts, including an aluminum hood and rear hatch, as well as improved aerodynamics. A more rigid chassis, upgraded engine mounts and a retuned double wishbone suspension have further reduced interior noise and ride harshness, making the 2016 Lexus RX even quieter and more refined, despite its increased performance and handling capabilities. A wide range of new luxury and technology features make their debut on the 2016 Lexus RX 350 and RX 450h. Base models are available with black or stratus gray interiors while models with the Premium or Luxury Packages can be had with parchment or brown leather seats. Interior trim choices range from standard black to \"Expresso Walnut\" or \"Matte Bamboo\" or \"Matte Linear Dark Mocha Wood\" on versions with the Premium Package. RX models with the Luxury Package offer \"Gray Sapele Wood with Aluminum\" trim\" featuring wood-over-aluminum paneling made with laser etching. This process combines these two materials in a unique way, creating an undeniably dramatic and upscale appearance. All 2016 RX models feature a standard 8-inch VGA central display screen or optional 12.3-inch screen that can be used for a full map view versus being split with other information as it was in previous years. A new, optional touch-free rear hatch system will open by simply placing a hand over the Lexus emblem, and a new rear-seat entertainment system features dual 11.6-inch displays mounted on the front seatbacks. There's also a choice of 9-, 12- or 15-speaker audio systems, the latter an 835-watt Mark Levinson system with 7.1 channel surround sound and Clari-Fi, a new technology from Harman that can restore much of the musical subtleties and nuances lost during the digital audio compression process. We've heard Clari-Fi in person, and it's surprisingly effective at making digital audio not sound so digital. The Lexus Safety System+ is the other big news for 2016 Lexus RXs. An integrated safety package, it features dynamic radar cruise control, a pre-collision and pedestrian detection system, lane keeping assist with lane departure warning and intelligent high beams that dim automatically based on external light sensors. Lexus, like most brands, is slowly-but-surely creeping toward the fully-autonomous world we'll be seeing in the next decade. For now, these systems can reduce the likelihood of collision between the RX and other vehicles, pedestrians or stationary objects. The pricing for this and other systems on the new RX 350 and RX 450h hasn't been released yet, but Lexus officials told us the new model will start below $45,000, which is approximately what the outgoing model costs. Given both the visual and dynamic upgrades to the 2016 Lexus RX we're confident it will continue to be a top seller in the increasingly crowded luxury SUV/crossover segment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T19:04:05.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
