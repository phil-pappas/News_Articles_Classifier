With kick-off at 2.30pm on both days they anticipate busy periods a few hours before and after the game.\nHighways England Traffic Officers at the regional control centre in Wakefield will be monitoring traffic, setting electronic signs and dispatching patrols of Traffic Officers to clear up any incidents as quickly as possible to keep supporters and other motorway users on the move. They will also be keeping a close eye on the potential for heavy traffic before and after the game.\nWe have been working hard for several months with local partners and the event organisers to consider the impact of these two events on the local and regional network.\nAdditional signing has been put up on our network on the M621 and by the local council on the A68 (M) and the A64 (M) to help with the park and ride schemes that have been put in place to help alleviate congestion.\nWe urge spectators travelling by car to plan ahead, allow extra time and follow the signs on roads in and around Leeds.\nâ€“ Highways England Fans can find more transport information here.\nLast updated Tue 22 Sep 2015 Travel Rugby world cup 2015 Leeds Elland Road", "external_links": ["http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/travel"], "published": "2015-09-23T00:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T17:52:47.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
