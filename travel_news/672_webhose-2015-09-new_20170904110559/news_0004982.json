The hotel, which is in St Brelade, beat off competition from 137 Pillars and the Aleenta in Thailand, The Lowell in New York, The Norman in Tel Aviv and The Yeatman in Portugal.\nOwner of The Atlantic Hotel, Patrick Burke, said: ‘The Food and Travel Reader Awards are a true indicator of public perception, and we are thrilled that The Atlantic Hotel has been recognised on a global stage. This is testament to the commitment of the entire team at The Atlantic Hotel to ensuring that each and every guest has an exemplary experience from the moment they step through the door.’\nThe Atlantic Hotel has been, and continues to be, recognised by many national and international awards bodies and media outlets, most recently winning the 2015 Condé Nast Johansens Award for Excellence (Best for Service). The hotel was selected as one of the four best island hotels in the UK by the Saturday Telegraph and in 2014 was crowned Independent Hotel of the Year at the prestigious Cateys.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T01:29:21.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
