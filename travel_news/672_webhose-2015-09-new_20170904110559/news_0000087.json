A further four in ten (40%) have not been on a cruise but are interested in going. A third (30%) of people stated that they are not interested in cruising.\nTable 1.1 – Attitude towards cruise holidays\nI have not been on a cruise holiday but am interested 40%\nI have not been on a cruise holiday and have no intention of going 30%\nI have been on a cruise holiday and want to go again 20%\nI have been on a cruise holiday but don’t want to go again 5%\nUnsure 5%\nCruises are an increasingly popular holiday option and in the last 12 months alone, one in ten (10%) people who have been on holiday took a cruise, a slight increase from 7% in 2014. This steady growth looks set to continue with 13% of people stating that they are planning a cruise holiday in the next 12 months.\nCruise holidays were particularly popular with holidaymakers aged 65+ with 13% of those who took a holiday in the last 12 months taking a cruise. They were followed by people aged 25-34, 12% of holidaymakers in this age group took a cruise in the last year. 25-34 year olds are also the most interested in taking cruise holidays with almost half (48%) stating that they were interested in trying a cruise. Additionally, 15% of young families (those with children under five) who took a holiday in the last 12 months took a cruise.\nPart of the growth of cruise holidays can be attributed to returning passengers; 80% of people who have been on a cruise stated that they would like to go again. For people who have been on a cruise, the chance to see multiple destinations tops the list of things they value about cruise holidays with the on board facilities, including catering, entertainment and accommodation, also highly prized.\nTable 1.2 – What people who have been on a cruise value about cruise holidays\nChance to see multiple destinations 77%\nQuality of food and drink offering 70%\nEase of travel 61%\nOn-board entertainment options 52%", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:13:23.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
