A year-on-year growth of 16 per cent or higher is expected for this year. \n\nChinese outbound expenditure in 2014 also increased, totalling US$164.8 billion. The report also attributes the growing acceptance of UnionPay cards by overseas merchants, and thus the ease of access to finances for Chinese tourists, as a contributor to the outbound growth momentum and increased spending. \n\nFavourite destinations for Chinese travellers include New Zealand, Singapore, Canada, Australia and the US, among others, in terms of customer satisfaction levels based on demands for conveniences such as Chinese tourist handbooks, Chinese restaurants, TV programmes in Chinese and UnionPay acceptance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T07:08:49.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
