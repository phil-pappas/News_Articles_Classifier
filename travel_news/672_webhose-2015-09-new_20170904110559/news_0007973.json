In fact, some current England internationals did not even attend rugby-playing schools yet still managed to rise to the top of the sport, thanks to the academies of professional clubs, whose scouts are always on the lookout for the next big thing. Alex Corbisiero is a case in point. The former London Irish prop, whose school did not offer pupils the option of playing the oval-ball game, needed to take a rather more circuitous route. And even then, the Northampton Saints star recalls being overlooked by Surrey selectors at under-15 and under-16 level. However, as soon as he was spotted by London Irish, Corbisiero’s progress to stardom was accelerated by his time in the academy. And despite early setbacks before that stage, the New York-born front-rower, steeled by his father Rick’s determination, kept driving towards his goal. “I didn’t think it was possible to achieve my ambition to be a professional rugby player until I was about 17. And even then I don’t think I could have done it without my dad,” says the 27-year-old. “I didn’t go to a rugby-playing school so it was always a bit of an uphill battle and he took it more personally than I did. In one season I played county rugby then got in to London Irish academy “ Dad always backed me and I remember when I got in to Surrey under-17s he was so emotional, because he knew that I should have been there; he’s always supported me and always believed. He would always keep repeating, ‘You’re going to be an England prop one day.’ And it actually did happen, so that’s pretty cool.” After reaching age-grade level, Corbisiero was suddenly on the radar for professional clubs, and soon local side London Irish offered him a £6,000-a-year contract to join their academy. “That was the turning point for me,” the 20-cap Northampton Saints star says, “although the biggest moment in my career before my England call-up was making that first step at under-17s. A lot of people go on from the England under-16s and I was nowhere near that, so that was pretty tough to take. “Then I was selected for the Surrey under-17s and I’d say I got in to London Irish off the back of that. In one season I played county rugby then got in to London Irish academy. That was when I thought, ‘Right, I’ve got an opportunity here, I’m going to make the most out of it and see where I get to.’ That was probably the start of the real journey.” At the Premiership club, Corbisiero was assigned a tutor – someone who would be able to show him the ropes, on and off the pitch. “Neal Hatley, who was my mentor at London Irish for a long time, instilled the importance of that attention to detail, and the you-can’t-rest-on-your-laurels attitude,” he says. Instinctive: Courtney Lawes Photo: Getty Images A graduate of Natal University, Hatley captained the England Saxons and was a long-serving prop for London Irish; when he retired he was the most capped player in Premiership history. Now forwards coach at Bath, he helped elevate Corbisiero from talented tyro to international, as well as British and Irish Lions Test prop in 2013. “Neal would say, ‘Someone’s going to be going for you in every game so you can’t take for granted all the little things that you do well,” adds Corbisiero. “He would create homework and checklists, making me watch the video analysis. And he would make me do that week in, week out. I couldn’t take it for granted. I feel very fortunate that he instilled that attitude in me at a young age.” Corbisiero moved to Northampton from London Irish in 2013 and there he joined England team-mate Courtney Lawes in the pack. The young lock, like Corbisiero, needed to be convinced of his powers, and it was not until he was selected for the club’s academy side that those skills began to be honed. For Lawes, being chosen to represent the town of his birth was an extra incentive to work hard. “I remember in my first year of playing at Northampton School for Boys in 2002, one of my coaches, Norman Barker, made me say, ‘I’m going to play for England when I get older.’ At the time I was like, ‘I don’t know if I even want to play rugby.’ So I just sort of said it. But now it’s come true. With rugby, if you’ve got the right mindset and you’re prepared to put your body on the line, you can do it.” His mother, Valerie Lawes, says her son’s playing for a feeder club for the Saints, Northampton Old Scouts, was the catalyst to the second-row’s success. “It just sort of snowballed from there. We had no idea where we were going with it,” she says. “We just enjoyed the ride.” Chris Parr, Lawes’ coach at Old Scouts, can count 2003 Rugby World Cup winners Steve Thompson and Ben Cohen – both players who started their professional careers at Saints – as alumni. My coach made me say, ‘I’m going to play for England when I get older.’ At the time I was like, ‘I don’t know if I even want to play rugby’ “Courtney had not played any rugby until he was 13 and came to Old Scouts because his mates from school were already here,” says Parr. “He was naturally very athletic, with great instinctive ball skills, but because he was so new to the sport his skills needed attention. Being so tall, the tendency was to tackle and ruck too high. “Courtney was completely laid back and sometimes not the most reliable. But then again how many 16-year-olds are? When he got in to the East Midlands, the penny seemed to drop and he realised that rugby may be his future. “He was under the radar at Saints, and attempts to interest them were difficult. There was a change at Saints' academy at the time and then they took an interest in East Midlands rugby. They were invited to watch a selection game at Oundle School, from which, within six months, Courtney joined Saints.” Lawes has played 102 games for Saints now, and on Friday, in the World Cup opener against Fiji, won his 41st England cap. He remembers where it all really began, though. “The first big moment in my career was my first game for Saints,” he says. “It was brilliant to play a major game just 18 years old. “An even bigger moment was when we won the 2014 Premiership – the first in the club’s history. With Saints you really feel that sense of history, because the whole town of Northampton loves rugby. They’re proper supporters – they’ll support you whether you’re good or bad.” Such support from the sidelines, and throughout their careers, has helped elevate Corbisiero and Lawes to the highest level in rugby. Thanks to their undoubted talent and no small amount of encouragement, the pair are living the dream. • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T18:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T16:52:03.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
