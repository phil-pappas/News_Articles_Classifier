I guess it has to do with the Army-size green globs that I was served as a small child. I was told, “They are good for you, eat them.”\nThose, of course, were frozen, then overcooked, and they had none of the lovely attributes of fresh Brussels sprouts — not even the shape. I’ve been experimenting with Brussels sprouts every chance I get by buying a handful at the grocery store and trying new cooking techniques. For the colder months, I love roasted sprouts with walnuts, grapes and apples, which you can find on kitchenscoop.com.\nBut in the temperate weather of fall, I like Sautéed Sprouts With Chicken Sausage and Fingerling Potatoes. You can use any type of sausage for this recipe, but chicken sausage tastes especially right with the sprouts.\nThis easy weeknight dinner goes together in less than 20 minutes from start to finish.\nSAUTÉED SPROUTS WITH CHICKEN SAUSAGE AND FINGERLING POTATOES\n2\nteaspoons extra-virgin olive oil\n1\nsmall onion, sliced in thin strips\n2\nlinks (about 3 ounces each) chicken sausage, or sausage of choice\n6\nounces Brussels sprouts (about 8 medium-size)\n4\nounces fingerling potatoes\n1/4\ncup dry white wine\n1\ntablespoon Dijon mustard\n3\ntablespoons 1 percent milk\nIn a medium skillet, heat oil over medium. Add onion, stir and cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until onion is completely soft. While onion is cooking, cut the sausage into 1/2-inch slices, leaving the casing intact around each slice; set aside. Cut the sprouts in half lengthwise and the unpeeled potatoes into 1/2-inch slices; set aside.\nAdd the sausage, sprouts and potatoes to the skillet and stir and cook for another 4 to 5 minutes, or until potatoes and sausage begin to lightly brown and onion caramelizes. Deglaze the pan with wine and scrape pan to loosen any brown bits. Cover skillet and allow the mixture to steam for 2 to 3 minutes to finish cooking the sprouts and potatoes. Remove the skillet from heat.\nMix together the mustard and milk and stir, or cover and shake well. Divide the sausage mixture into 2 bowls and drizzle equally with the Dijon sauce. Serve immediately. Makes 2 servings.\nPER SERVING: Calories 331 (33% from fat), Fat 12 g (3 g sat), Cholesterol 71 mg, Sodium 625 mg, Fiber 6 g, Carbohydrates 29 g, Protein 21 g", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T06:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T00:56:23.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
