The opera fluent among the guests at the gala dinner following the premiere of Bartlett Sher ’s production of Verdi’s Otello understood that Gelb was referring to the fact that the production is the first at the Met to feature a white Otello not in blackface-style makeup, a tradition that persisted, shockingly, until as recently as two years ago. Patricia Clarkson nodded, Bette Midler and Brooke Shields smiled wide.\nThe post-premiere dinner was a sea of circular tables dancing around one long skinny table where glossy guests were all clustered together. There was Drew Barrymore with husband Will Kopelman sitting next Will’s sister, Jill Kargman , and her husband, Harry . “This is giving me tabletop boner!” said Kargman, as she snapped a photo of the endless table adorned with a sea of highball glasses filled with roses in varying shades of pink. Diane von Furstenberg and Barry Diller made a beeline to greet Jessica Hart and Stavros Niarchos III , who took their seats early. Across the table, Jessica Chastain chatted with Alexander Skarsgard and Barrymore showed baby photos to Dermot Mulroney on her iPhone.
