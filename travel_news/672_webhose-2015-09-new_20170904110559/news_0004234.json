Formed in 2013, the company is a joint venture between One Event Management Ltd and Legends Hospitality who have partnered with Manchester City to provide what it believes to be the best stadium catering in the Premier League. \nPriava CEO James Pegum commented, “We are delighted to have been selected by such a prestigious and exciting brand that is breaking new ground in the world of stadium catering and hospitality. With Priava, they now have a complete booking and event sales and management solution that it is simple to use, yet also provides them with crucial business reporting. The fact that it is cloud-based is also a benefit because they do not have to invest in servers or rely on in-house IT support as everything is done remotely.” As well as providing world-class food at the Etihad, Fabulous Fan Fayre also plans to use Priava’s software to support similar ventures with other large stadia across the UK and Europe. Fabulous Fan Fayre will take advantage of Priava’s ‘Advanced Permissions Module’ that provides controlled user access to different events and information, allowing them to use the system across multiple locations and venues in the future. The company also plans to use Priava’s API (application programming interface) to ultimately link to its core finance system. Headquartered in New York, Legends Hospitality already provides award-winning food and beverage for the iconic (Dallas) Cowboys and (New York) Yankee Stadiums, whilst One Event Management Ltd is a collection of Food and Beverage business’s within Nigel Harris’s holding company Hard8, providing catering services to events such as Volvo round the world, Ageon championships, British Grand Prix- Silverstone, Lords Cricket and Isle of Wight Festival. Priava’s technology is already in use at other stadiums across the globe including Celtic Football Club, Football New South Wales and Western Australian Cricket Association.
