The tourists were travelling in four vehicles that had entered a restricted zone in the Wahat area of the western desert.\n12 people were killed in all. Ten Mexican and Egyptian tourists were also injured and were taken to the local hospital.\nAn investigative team has been formed to look into what exactly happened. The incident was condemned by the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto.\nAt least two Mexican nationals were killed and the identities of the other victims have not been confirmed. The Mexican tourists who were injured are in a stable condition.\nSince the tourists were travelling in a military zone which is off limits for foreigners it was natural that the military forces took such a drastic step. The vast desert area is attractive to foreign sightseers but the area is also frequented by terrorist groups so the military mistakenly took such a drastic step said the Egyptian Ministry.\nWith terrorist activity on the rise the region is a gateway to the long border with Libya as weapons are available on the other side.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T14:08:18.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
