For any association CEO position, 15 years is a relatively long time, and Gehrisch told Skift this summer during the annual DMAI conference in Austin that he was reprioritizing certain values following the recent passing of his father.\nDuring his tenure, Gehrisch emphasized the role of destination marketing organizations (DMOs) as a vehicle for developing partnerships with local travel suppliers to drive economic development and job growth. He was also a strident advocate for educating elected officials and business stakeholders that the economic impact of tourism promotion extended well beyond filling hotel rooms.\nGehrisch entered his position when the organization was originally called the International Association of Convention & Visitors Bureaus. In July 2005, he stewarded a strategic brand repositioning to rename the organization: Destination Marketing Association International. The purpose behind that was to emphasize the role of DMOs in destination branding and business development, versus what had devolved into producing printed destination guides and operating aging visitor centers.\n“Michael unquestionably has taken DMAI such a long way, and given it more credibility than anyone else before him,” says Bob Lander, chairman of the DMAI board, and CEO of the Austin Convention & Visitors Bureau. “In any association, you’re going to have people who support you and people who oppose you, and I always thought that Michael handled that very well. I understand why he chose to regroup. In our industry, you’re on 24/7, expectations are always high, and things are always moving rapidly.”\nWhile many industry people consider the IACVB/DMAI rebranding as Gehrisch’s most important legacy, he was also instrumental in leading the development of DMAI’s DestinationNEXT research over the last three years.\nAt the annual DMAI conference this year, Gehrisch introduced the rollout of phase two of DestinationNEXT. It provides a comprehensive series of best practices for destination marketing in the 21st century, and a self-assessment tool for destinations to determine which specific best practices they need to adopt.\n“Voters don’t often recognize the economic value of tourism, and we can show all these big numbers about economic spend all we want, but for most voters that’s just a lot of white noise,” says Lander. “Instead, we need fight the battle to explain the number of jobs and the taxes that tourism provides. Voters understand that.”\nWe asked Lander what impressed him most about the outgoing CEO.\n“Michael was always curious about how other organizations were innovating,” he said. “He developed alliances with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the U.S. Conference of Mayors, for example, so he opened up some doors in Washington D.C. that weren’t available to us before. For that, and other reasons, we’re going to miss him.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T10:37:27.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
