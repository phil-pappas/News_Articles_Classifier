Szostak, 40, hails from La Celle Saint-Cloud, west of Paris, but lives in Connecticut with her husband and two sons. She’s an avid golfer (she played at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Va.) and loves to travel — especially to the seaside retreat of Capbreton in southwestern France. We caught up with Szostak to talk all things travel.\nFavorite vacation spot? Our summer vacation in Capbreton, for the family, love, beauty of the region, and amazing food — all of which contribute to complete and utter relaxation.\nContinue reading below\nFavorite food or drink while vacationing? Aperitif time with an IPA or lager around 6 p.m., with some charcuteries or peanuts.\nWhere would you like to travel to but haven’t? South Africa, Kenya, Costa Rica, Vietnam, Turkey, etc. The best of traveling for me is experiencing the different pace of life, cultures, and feeling completely out of my comfort zone.\nOne item you can’t leave home without when traveling? My contact lens solution.\nAisle or window? Either-or. Window to rest my head, and aisle for easy access to the can.\nFavorite childhood travel memory? A dude ranch in Gaylord, Mich., where I went every year for a week from ages 5 to 14: horses, hayrides, summer heat, the smell of pine needles, water skiing, s’mores, and pure happiness.\nGuilty pleasure when traveling? Not working out — and cracking open that IPA at 9 a.m. Just kidding.\nBest travel tip? Plan just enough, but not too much. Be spontaneous and don’t feel guilty about being lazy.\nJuliet Pennington can be reached at writeonjuliet@comcast.net .", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Ftravel%2F2015%2F08%2F28%2Fthe-vip-lounge-stephanie-szostak%2FdMCpTLG26eWUwtzXMp0vjO%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tThe", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The", "https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Ftravel%2F2015%2F08%2F28%2Fthe-vip-lounge-stephanie-szostak%2FdMCpTLG26eWUwtzXMp0vjO%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&media=//c.o0bg.com/rw/Boston/2011-2020/2015/07/07/BostonGlobe.com/Travel/Images/Fenway.jpg&description=Stephanie", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Ftravel%2F2015%2F08%2F28%2Fthe-vip-lounge-stephanie-szostak%2FdMCpTLG26eWUwtzXMp0vjO%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=The", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Ftravel%2F2015%2F08%2F28%2Fthe-vip-lounge-stephanie-szostak%2FdMCpTLG26eWUwtzXMp0vjO%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=The"], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T23:44:57.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
