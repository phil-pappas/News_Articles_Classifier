The race is unique in Europe, as nowhere else do athletes have an opportunity to run on an otherwise active runway at an operational airport. This is the third time that Budapest Airport has organized this in-ternational event, which heralds the onset of the fall running season in Budapest, and where aviation professionals from airlines, airports, handling and service companies and airport authorities don running shoes to see who is faster. The weather was kind to the participants in the end, as the rain stopped ten minutes before the start, and runners were able to set off on the runway in overcast but dry conditions.\nProceeds from the registration fees of Hungarian runners will be donated to the “Suhanj!” Founda-tion, whose members help and create sporting opportunities for disabled or visually impaired people, and those of foreign participants will go to Anthony Nolan, a UK-based charity financing bone marrow transplants for children with leukemia. The wheelchaired and visually impaired athletes supported by the “Suhanj!” Foundation were of course able to start the race from the first row. Staff from numerous authorities and services worked with Budapest Airport to ensure that the race could be held seamlessly, in the security restricted area of the airport. The event has developed into something of an informal aviation forum, as managers from numerous airlines, travel agencies, aircraft manufacturers, airports, hotels and other companies meet on the concrete at Budapest Airport – in running gear.\n“It was very inspiring to run jointly with more than 900 people down a runway that is designed for aircraft, I think everybody enjoyed this rare opportunity,” said Jost Lammers, the CEO of Budapest Airport. He added: „I am very proud that Budapest Airport hosted this event, which is unique in its category in Europe. We not only offer an unforgettable sporting experience to participants, but can also show the beauties of the city of Budapest to our guests and business partners from the aviation industry. The race also supports good causes, by donating funds from registration fees to the Suhanj! Foundation in Hungary and Anthony Nolan in the UK, helping bone marrow transplant operations for children with leukemia.”\nIn addition to offering two distances for individuals, the race was also open to teams of two. Wroclaw Airport from Poland became the fastest airport, ahead of Budapest and Berlin. The fastest airline was Swiss International, with Aer Lingus and Hungarian carrier Wizz Air second and third, respectively. The award for the fastest commercial partner from the airport went to the team from Hungarian Duty Free, operated by Heinemann Duty Free.
