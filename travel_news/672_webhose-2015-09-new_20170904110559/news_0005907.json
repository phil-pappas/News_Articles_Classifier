(CKD IM), a newly-created trust, announced today the creation of a co-investment vehicle for infrastructure projects in Mexico . This innovative partnership between leading Mexican financial institutions and a large international pension fund manager constitutes a first in North America . The new co-investment platform will combine world-class infrastructure expertise with established local networks. The platform will invest up to MXN 35.1 billion ( CAD 2 .8 billion) over the next five years.\nThe agreement provides CDPQ and CKD IM with an ideal platform to participate in the expansion and the modernization of Mexico's infrastructures. Fueled by ambitious structural reforms, favourable demographics and robust demand from the United States , the Mexican economy is poised for significant growth in years to come. Infrastructure opportunities show particular promise in the wake of the government of Mexico's four-year, MXN 7.7 trillion plan for infrastructure investments, targeting energy and transportation projects, among others.\nOver the next five years, the co-investment platform expects to pursue a wide range of investment opportunities in several sectors of the infrastructure market, such as energy generation (including renewable energy), transmission and distribution, transportation and public transit, among others.\nDuring this period, CDPQ plans to commit MXN 17.876 billion ( CAD 1.43 billion ) and CKD IM MXN 17.215 billion ( CAD 1.38 billion ). CDPQ will hold a 51% interest in the co-investment vehicle. CKD IM, whose shares are listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange, will hold the remaining 49%.

Given the scope of the opportunities in this sector, we are pleased to join forces with leading Mexican institutional investors. By combining their in-depth knowledge of the market and local networks with our infrastructure expertise, we are creating an innovative investment platform that is ideally positioned to find and invest in the best Mexican infrastructure projects,\" said Michael Sabia , President and CEO of CDPQ.\nCDPQ has been a major infrastructure investor for more than 15 years. Its infrastructure portfolio today is worth more than CAD 11 billion and includes investments in the Port of Brisbane ( Australia ), Heathrow Airport, Eurostar, and Colonial Pipeline in the United States . By 2018, CDPQ aims to double the size of this portfolio.\n\"CKD Infraestructura México is the largest consortium of Mexican pension funds created to date. Together, these funds will invest in major projects that will provide tangible benefits for Mexicans, since it has been proven that infrastructure investments contribute to productivity and GDP growth,\" said Eduardo Ramos , General Manager of CKD IM. \"For us, it was a natural fit to partner with CDPQ, a global investor that shares our long-term vision and brings to the table its experience investing in infrastructure projects worldwide.\"\n\"We believe recent reforms in the energy and infrastructure sectors have opened the possibility of win-win partnerships that will benefit the whole Mexican economy. The platform we are announcing today is perhaps the best example of these new opportunities,\" said Marcos Ramirez Miguel , CEO of Grupo Financiero Banorte.\n\"The creation of this platform establishes a partnership between Mexican funds and a global investor who shares their priorities: a long-term view, a preference for tangible assets, and durable performance,\" said Enrique Solorzano , CEO of Afore SURA.\n\"This partnership illustrates Mexico's shift toward a new development strategy, investment and growth. Few emerging markets can boast a reform agenda as ambitious as Mexico and we are pleased to participate and highlight the ability of the Mexican funds to launch and lead promising initiatives\", said Luis Sayeg , CEO of Afore Banamex.\n\"We believe that Mexico is on the right track to fulfill expectations tied to the much-awaited passage of economic reforms enacted at the beginning of President Peña Nieto's administration. The launch of this investment vehicle, which is most certainly the beginning of a brand new chapter in the area of infrastructure deployment in Mexico , will indeed pave the way for future investments that would boost this country's competitive advantages as the aforesaid reforms are implemented and deliver their promise. We at Pensionissste are also convinced that this partnership will serve as the stepping stone for a number of related transactions that should catapult infrastructure investment in the country throughout the coming decade to a new plateau,\" said Jose Maria de la Torre , CEO of Pensionissste.\n\"This new investment vehicle is ideally suited to capitalise on current and future opportunities brought about by the current administration's reforms, benefiting both from CDPQ's experience in global infrastructure and our strong networks and deep knowledge of the Mexican infrastructure market. We expect these complementary contributions to fuel and strengthen all investment decisions,\" said Francisco Gonzalez , CEO of Fonadin.\nThe co-investment vehicle's first transaction\nAs part of the transaction announced today, CKD IM is also acquiring 49% of CDPQ's equity investment in the ICA OVT platform, announced on June 19, 2015 .
