Excellent location, fabulous service and extra treats for celebrity pet Travels with Journey . \nSanta Monica California \nHere's how you can spend a romantic night in ultra luxury, dine in your robe in your room or hit Ocean Avenue for Sushi. But here is the catch. You have to have a dog sitter and if you can't find one the Fairmont Miramar staff will help. \nWE got lucky! Our dear friend Joanna Bateman was available. Double Bow Wow!! Watch! \nJourney loves Joanna and Kyle. Both are working singer song writers country western style \nLuxEcoLiving photo credits \nThe Fairmont Santa Monica is a rare find for people who want to travel with their pets. Here's why. Everyone who greets you has a smile on their face and its not because their pleased to see you. Most fall head over heals for your pet. There isn't anything they won't do to make him or her happy.You want more treats brought to your room? No service charge. You want a dog walker so you can sleep in? They can arrange it. And for those other times your dog requires to smell the grass, it is just a \"quick\" elevator ride down to the lobby and garden area. So well planned. \nWhat we especially loved about the Santa Monica Fairmont Miramar is the location. Steps away from the famous Santa Monica pier and the beautiful newly designed 4th Street Promenade. Ocean Avenue is home to all of Santa Monica residents and on Sundays you see joggers, cyclists, skaters, and tons of dogs and their owners strutting down the park pathways. The scent of the ocean also draws tourism to the max during the summer months. \nIf you want diversion it's there but if you prefer privacy and a relaxed atmosphere the environment inside the grounds of the Fairmont Miramar is just perfect. We had a wonderful brunch served outside on the terrace overlooking the koi pond. In fact, one of the best burgers I have ever eaten! What is that secret sauce? \nBut if you want to know the rich history of this particular hotel and the famous route that brought celebrities and visitors alike to this particular epicenter all you have to do is look for this sign. \nEven the very famous now immortal Jim Morrison hung out in Santa Monica. Rumor has it that he also recorded a rare version of Led Zeppelin's Stairway To Heaven. \nEditor's Notes: \nComing up: Travels with Journey to The Fairmont San Francisco. \nA special thank you to Jacqueline Kerns and her staff. \nThe Fairmont Miramar Hotel and Bungalows 101 Wilshire Blvd, Santa Monica, CA 90401 (310) 576-7777", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T23:21:19.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
