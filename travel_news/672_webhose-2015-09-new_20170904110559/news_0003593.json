Not many other (countries) can do that,” he added. \n\nAccording to Samarasinghe, the congress will welcome over 600 global industry leaders to Negombo, and will help to showcase to the world that the country is ready for business and leisure travel. \n\nThe association’s Annual General Meeting, PATA Youth Symposium, PATA Market Place, PATA Chapter Colloquium, PATA Foundation Gala Dinner, committee meetings, workshops and complimentary tours will also be held there. \n\nNegombo, north of Sri Lanka’s largest city Colombo and a 15-minute drive from the international airport, is ready for world events. It has more than 2,000 hotel rooms today, making up 10 per cent of the country’s total 22,800 keys. \n\nWhile the current top source markets for the country are China, the UK and India, Samarasinghe said there is a lot of untapped potential from South-east Asia. \n\nBhagaban Shrestha, managing director of Himalayan Holidays in Bangkok, who has up to 400 pax travelling to Sri Lanka on five- to seven-day packages every year, commented: “Sri Lanka appeals to the religious in Thailand because of its temples and pagodas. We also have direct air connections so it is convenient.” \n\nEarlier in May, the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau announced that it had secured a Rs3.4 billion (US$51 million) promotions budget for 2015 to fund trade fairs, roadshows, advertising and fam trips for 280 travel consultants and 280 journalists this year. \n\nThese efforts are expected to help Sri Lanka hit 2.5 million arrivals in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:02:02.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
