Around 135,500 of these passengers are expected to fly in and out of the UK.\neasyJet’s peak flying day comes as Europe’s businesses get back to work, using the airline’s unrivalled network to travel between primary airports in key cities. Around 20% of easyJet’s passengers are flying on business taking advantage of the convenient and frequent schedules.\nThe end of the school holidays and unpredictable British weather has also prompted many to seek some last-minute sunshine using easyJet’s low fares. Popular destinations for the airline’s passengers include sunspots such as Malaga, Barcelona, Palma, Faro, Nice, Milan, Alicante and Olbia.\nSophie Dekkers, easyJet’s UK Director, said:\n“We’re delighted that so many passengers have chosen to get back to business or start their late summer breaks with us.\n“Thanks to our passengers being able to take advantage of our wide variety of popular destinations, low fares, friendly service and business offering, easyJet is continuing to grow. Around 6.8% more passengers travelled with us this August compared to last.\n“We always strive to make our passengers’ journey as easy as possible. Our customers can check-in up to 30 days ahead of their flights and receive live flight updates on our flight tracker tool. Our mobile boarding passes are also proving particularly popular with more than 10% of passengers now using them in place of paper boarding passes.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T12:21:35.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
