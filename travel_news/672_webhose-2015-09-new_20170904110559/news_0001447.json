Equipped with all that a family needs at home and more, the villas are set to give guests comfort away from home. \nThe decor of the villas are impressive, one which helps to create the perfect romantic atmosphere, ideal for couples, but at the same time it is family-friendly. \nNatural, simple, but very chic - these few words can describe the decor which blends in well with the unspoiled beauty of the surroundings. \nThe villas are very spacious, each having their own swirling pool, a well-equipped kitchen, open sitting room, and a dining area. \nEvery corner of the villas can be turned into relaxation spots - from the bedrooms to the open living room or on the deck with a swirling pool. \nThere is also a study which can be turned into a large bedroom, if need be. It is furnished with all that is needed for a comfortable stay and peaceful nights. \nFine dining and the beach bar \nNo need to go to restaurants for mouth-watering dishes. These can be prepared in the villa by a “private chef,” and guests can dine in style under the stars, or enjoy a healthy lunch or breakfast in their open dining area. \nNorth Island also has a chill-out bar - the West Beach bar - where their clients can enjoy a selection of cocktails, tapas, not forgetting the music, and simply having a good time. \nThose wanting a romantic night out of their villas can do so at the Island Piazz, which overlooks the azure ocean. The piazza’s decor is a stunning one - art in itself. \nThe honeymoon beach \nAside from the West beach, Petite Anse, the East beach has been chosen by many couples honeymooning on North Island. Secluded and offering total privacy, it is the place for those picnicking a deux. \nThe North Island team ensures that all is prepared for the couple, from champagne to homemade hors d’oeuvres, all in a picnic basket, so that they can indeed spend a memorable time together. \nFun for the children \nNorth Island provides a unique experience for the children as well. There are no kids’ centers or activity rooms, as the concept is for the children to feel like they are on an island and enjoying the fun of being there and exploring the natural environment. Many activities are organized, which help the children to understand the vitality of conservation and having beautiful and natural surroundings. \nEnjoying North \nCompared to many of the other islands in the archipelago, North Island has no pier or jetty, and there is a reason for that. The aim of keeping it as it is, was to aid it in preserving it as a “rodent-free” island, and reduce the disruption to ocean currents and beach movements. A wooden cross on a rock at East beach which was used long ago as a navigational aid, is today the place where one can enjoy sundowner drinks. \nOn North Island, privacy and peace are in “abundance.” The only sounds you will hear are from nature, with the birds, the waves, and the swaying of the leaves. North Island is all about the guests, their wishes, and giving them a luxurious and once-in-a-lifetime experience on the most romantic and secluded island in the world. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
