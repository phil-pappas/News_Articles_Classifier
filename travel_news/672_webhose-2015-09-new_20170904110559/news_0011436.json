This will also send storms farther north into Canada and should keep most tropical moisture at bay in the South.\nThe heat will not only be confined to the Northeast. Above-average temperatures will stretch across the Midwest and Great Lakes region as well. Chicago, Detroit and Indianapolis will have high temperatures this week 5 to 15 degrees above normal.\nThe combination of the heat and high humidity will make for rather uncomfortable conditions outside this week. Those who must endure several hours working in these conditions are advised to stay hydrated and to take breaks in the shade or in an air-conditioned environment.\nHeat is one of the leading weather-related killers in the United States every year and is something to be taken seriously. Several precautionary measures can be taken to beat the heat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T18:08:44.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
