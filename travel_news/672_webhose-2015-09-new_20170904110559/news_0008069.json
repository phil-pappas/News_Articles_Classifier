Nch’kay played a prominent role in the Squamish Nation’s creation story, offering sanctuary to the region’s people during the great flood, explains Campbell. \nThe site also provides crucial nesting habitat to the peregrine falcon, prompting periodic closures of certain climbing routes throughout the year. \nOn any given summer day, small coloured specks can be made out dotting the mountain’s face, indicating yet another band of climbers who have opted for the more direct, albeit somewhat more challenging, path to the peak. \nThe mountain itself cuts a striking image from afar, visible at the base of the scenic Sea-to-Sky Highway as a radiant granite sentinel, standing watch over the sleepy community of Squamish. The monolith is the namesake of the First Nation settlement of Stawamus, located immediately at its foot. \nSmooth, glacier-polished stone hints at the Chief’s formative glacial past, while Smartwool- and Gore-Tex-clad hikers belong to its present. \nA middle-aged couple from Michigan braved the moss-covered crag and scrambled up the occasional metal ladder and chain to reach the first peak. \n“You just can’t do justice to this place,” says David McGreaham, marvelling at the view with his wife Kathy. “This is something I’ll remember.” \nOther visitors come from farther afield. Ludovic Minne of France was about to wrap up two weeks of climbing and hiking in the Pacific Northwest. \n“Some people told me if you go to B.C. you have to go to Squamish,” says the 25-year-old Frenchman, sitting in the parking lot at the mountain’s base, camping stove and breakfast supplies spread out before him — a regular occurrence. \n“The view is just amazing — really, really beautiful,” he adds, smiling broadly as he describes watching the sunset from the summit the night before. \n“I’m just happy to be here.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T06:26:57.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
