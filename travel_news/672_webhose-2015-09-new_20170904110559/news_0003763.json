The waters of the vast surrounding oceans offer some of the best seafood on the international market.\nHere are five seafood delicacies that you must sample on a visit to New Zealand – each one from a South Island region so that’s the best place for you to start. Fly into Christchurch then head north to Kaikoura and Marlborough, west to Aoraki Mt Cook and the West Coast, or south to Bluff.\nGreen-lipped mussels in Marlborough\nA New Zealand specialty not to be found anywhere else in the world, this particularly large and flavoursome mussel is simply delicious. It is easily distinguished from other mussels by the dark green shell with a bright green lip that it is named for.\nYou can get these mussels pretty much anywhere in New Zealand all year around, but it’s best to have them at the source around Marlborough, where 80% of New Zealand’s mussel production is based.\nSurrounded by the natural beauty of the sheltered Marlborough Sounds, the best way to indulge in this local delicacy is on board the mussel cruise where you can enjoy freshly steamed mussels with a glass of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc for the ultimate wine and food match.\nTravel Tips\nMarlborough Tour Company’s Seafood Odyssea departs from Picton Harbour every afternoon. You can cruise through the tranquil Marlborough Sounds while enjoying a lunch of freshly steamed mussels and a visit to the mussel farm. Blenheim airport is a 30-minute drive from Picton. Air New Zealand flies daily to Blenheim airport from Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.\nCrayfish in Kaikoura\nNew Zealand crayfish is marketed as lobster in some overseas market, but, in reality, these are two different species. While crayfish ressembles lobster, it is much smaller, averaging 5-15cm (2-6 inches) in length. A common way to cook crayfish is to boil whole, split and serve with a seafood dressing.\nThe South Island coastal highway southeast from Blenheim to Kaikoura has been described as one of the most beautiful ocean roads in the world. The little town of Kaikoura, which sits between ocean and mountains on this highway, is famous for its diverse marine wildlife including whales and seals, and some of the best crayfish in the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T15:22:06.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
