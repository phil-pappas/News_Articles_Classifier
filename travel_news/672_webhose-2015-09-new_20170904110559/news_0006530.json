This means they grip well on firm snow, but are less easy to handle in deep powder – with a couple of exceptions. Most of them contain metal, for stiffness and grip, and also to provide vibration-dampening at high speeds. With relatively curvy sidecuts, these skis are designed to carve trenches through the corduroy, with plenty of speed and acceleration. Atomic Redster XTi £575 Best for: Reassurance in aggressive, dynamic turns With great grip and stability at speed, these Redsters feel comfortable on an edge, offering the skier a trustworthy platform throughout the turn. They make it easy to initiate short, sharp turns – seemingly doing most of the hard work for you – and are rated best in this category for short turns, liveliness/responsiveness and groomed piste. They're better suited to dynamic, aggressive skiers, as they can be a little grabby at lower speeds. Tech talk Sidewall construction with ash/poplar wood core, beefed up with two layers of titanium. Five per cent rocker at tip. + Edge hold, short turns, long turns, high speed, liveliness/responsiveness, groomed piste – Low speed, off piste Lengths: 157, 164, 169, 176 Sidecut: 116/72/103 (169) Radius: 15.5m (169) Blizzard G Power FS £800 Best for: A fabulous high-speed ride for athletic skiers Stiff and powerful, these are great for long turns at speed, and suit strong, aggressive, athletic skiers. With superb edge hold, they provide a fabulous high-speed ride – FS refers to a 'full-suspension' system integrated into the skis and bindings to dampen vibrations. But these G Powers are slow in the transitions of short turns, and the gap between their on- and off-piste performance is significant. Tech talk Sidewall construction with wood core strengthened with carbon and titanium. Tip and tail rockers. + Edge hold, long turns, high speed, groomed piste – Short turns, low speed, off piste Lengths: 167, 174, 181 Sidecut: 124/75/108 (all lengths) Radius: 13.5m (174) Dynastar Omeglass Pro £670 Best for: A day of piste-bashing on groomers and bumps The Omeglass Pros pull off a neat trick. With outstanding results for smoothness and groomed piste, they're stable and turn easily when put on edge in long carves. Yet they also one of the best in the group for moguls – and this despite their weak point: the effort they require to initiate short turns. They're ideal for a day of carving on smooth groomers with the odd foray into the bumps. Tech talk Sidewall construction with wood core. Tip rocker. + Smoothness, groomed piste, moguls – Short turns, liveliness/responsiveness Lengths: 158, 163, 168, 173 Sidecut: 121/67/105 (all lengths) Radius: 13m (168) Faction Eight £360 Best for: On-piste grip with off-piste versatility Despite being relatively wide, which helps them perform well off piste through crud, the Eights also provide surprisingly good edge hold on piste. Voted best of this category for versatility and off piste, they're great for playing around on – ideal for skiers who stick mainly to the piste, but occasionally like to venture outside the markers, too. They perform well in long turns but are not as nimble in short turns as many others in the group. Tech talk Sidewall construction with a poplar/ash wood core, reinforced with fibreglass. Rockered at both ends. + Long turns, versatility, off piste – Short turns, moguls Lengths: 168, 172, 176, 180, 184 Sidecut: 112/85/98 (all lengths) Radius: 18m/22m (176) Fischer Progressor 19 Ti Best on test £600 Best for: Solidity with a touch of playfulness Using AirCarbon – a high-performance material formed from sequestered carbon emissions – Fischer has built skis that are light and easy to turn at low speeds, yet also surprisingly solid in long turns with speed. They're well suited to strong, aggressive skiers, coming to life at high speed, when they offer better grip and more playfulness. A curvier sidecut at the front of the ski, compared to the tail, allows for faster initiation. They came out strongest in this category for long turns and high speed and were ranked highly in most other criteria. Tech talk Partial cap construction, with lower sidewalls than last year's Progressors. Wood core, strengthened with Titanal (an aluminium alloy) and AirCarbon. Multi-radius sidecut. Tip rocker. + Long turns, high speed, smoothness, groomed piste – Off piste Lengths: 163, 170, 177, 182 Sidecut: 122/75/104 (all lengths) Radius: 13m/17m (170) Head iSupershape Magnum £535 Best for: Light, agile, non-aggressive skiers Lovely forgiving skis for smooth skiers, these make the initiation of rapid-fire short turns a pleasure, coming around quickly and effortlessly – they are notably supple in the moguls. Head's F1-style KERS (kinetic energy recovery system) uses an electronic chip to stiffen the tail of the ski at the exit of the turn, increasing rebound and acceleration. They lose none of that smoothness in long turns, with an easy transition from edge to edge. Light, agile, non-aggressive skiers will enjoy the Magnums. Tech talk Partial cap construction with wood core, reinforced with titanium. Ten per cent tip rocker. + Low speed, liveliness/responsiveness, groomed piste – Off piste Lengths: 149, 156, 163, 170, 177 Sidecut: 108/72/106 (170) Radius: 13.1m (170) K2 AMP Bolt £625 Best for: Smoothness at speed When you go for a charge, the Bolts are smooth and steady as a polished rock – in fact, they lead the group for smoothness. Versatile and reliable, they hold long carves well but are also easy to steer through choppy moguls using short turns. Using K2's Mod suspension system – a secondary core that flexes on top of the primary one – the Bolts are good at dampening vibrations, to the point of being a little bit sluggish in the transitions between turns. Tech talk Cap construction, but with sidewalls underfoot. Fir wood core reinforced with Titanal and a web of carbon fibres. Tip rocker. + Long turns, high speed, smoothness, groomed piste, moguls – None Lengths: 172, 179, 186 Sidecut: 125/72/99 (all lengths) Radius: 18m (179) Kästle RX12 £875 Best for: Brave turns close to the fall line The RX12s' best areas were high speed and groomed piste. Stiff and strong, they suit an aggressive style of skier. They prefer high speeds and longer turns and you have to work them hard to open up their potential. In icy conditions, it’s difficvult to intiate short turns but let them run and they’ll be comfortable on their edges. Kästle's Hollowtech construction means unnecessary layers are removed in the tip area to save on weight, reducing vibrations by 30 per cent. Tech talk Sidewall construction with an ash wood core, strengthened with Titanal. Traditional camber. + High speed, groomed piste – Short turns, liveliness/responsiveness, versatility, off piste, moguls Lengths: 168, 176, 184 Sidecut: 118/70/100 (all lengths) Radius: 16.5m (176) Nordica Fire Arrow 76 Ti £600 Best for: Letting it rip Lively and fun, these suit athletic skiers, since they require some effort to get the most out of them in short turns. At high speeds, however, they're great on their edges. They come out best in this category for edge hold, also performing near the top for long turns, high speed and groomed piste. Great all-round piste skis, they really turn and grip well. Tech talk Sidewall construction, with wood core and two layers of titanium. Reduced sidecut to prevent oversteer at the end of the turn. Slight rocker at tips. + Edge hold, long turns, high speed, groomed piste – None Lengths: 152, 160, 168, 176 Sidecut: 126/76/109 (all lengths) Radius: 14m (168) Rossignol Pursuit 700 £555 Best for: Performance at varying speeds Light, responsive and easy to ski, the Pursuit 700s corner well at high or low speeds. They should appeal to many advanced-to-expert skiers, especially if they often need to ski slower than their ability yet maintain form – ideal for instructors or parents. Near the tips, grooves are cut lengthwise into the topsheet, to improve power transfer and increase grip, which aids turn initiation. Tech talk Partial cap construction incorporates a wood core, reinforced with titanium. Ten per cent tip rocker. + Short turns, low speed, smoothness – None Lengths: 163, 170, 177, 184 Sidecut: 127/73/109 (all lengths) Radius: 14m (170) Salomon X-Max £560 Best for: Maintaining velocity in a variety of conditions Great on their edges and comfortable at speed. Grippy on ice, they give you the confidence to test a variety of terrain. They top the group for low speed and are also unsurpassed in moguls, where they are remarkably agile. They complete turns without delay – arguably helped by Salomon's Powerline carbon shock absorber, which runs along the centre of the topsheet. Tech talk Sidewall construction, with a wood core, beefed up with two layers of titanium. Ten per cent tip rocker. + Long turns, high speed, low speed, groomed piste, moguls – None Lengths: 155, 160, 165, 170, 175 Sidecut: 120/73/103 (165) Radius: 14m (165) Scott Black Majic £500 Best for: Easy pivoting and stable carving , with fabulous edge grip on ice The Black Majics feel forgiving and fun to ski. They're light and easy to pivot at low speeds but it's difficult to shorten their carving radius if you want to make more aggressive slalom turns. They're at their best in long, high-speed turns, where they provide great stability. It's this predictability that allows such an enjoyable ride. Tech talk Sidewall construction, with a wood core reinforced by two layers of Titanal, and the topsheet has a convex shape for torsional strength. Multi-radius sidecut with curvy tip and tail for easy turn initiation and completion, but relatively straight underfoot for power and precise edge-hold. Tip rocker. + Long turns, high speed, smoothness, groomed piste – Short turns Lengths: 157, 167, 177, 184 Sidecut: 122/78/112 (177) Radius: 14m/21m/11m (177) Völkl Code Speedwall L £700 Best for: A smooth, vibration-free ride Responsive in short turns and holding their edges well in long turns, the Code Speedwall Ls are strong performers. The UVO (Ultimate Vibration Object) dampening system, which sits on the shovel of the ski, really smooths out any bumps, creating a smooth and stable ride. Naturally, they handle moguls well, and are reasonably efficient in off-piste conditions, although this is not their forte. Tech talk Partial cap construction containing titanium and a wood core (which has hardwood along the edges, for grip, and softwood in the middle of the ski, for agility). Tip and tail rockers. + Edge hold, long turns, high speed, smoothness, groomed piste – Off piste Lengths: 164, 171, 178, 185 Sidecut: 124/76/105 (all lengths) Radius: 18.2m (178) Women's Piste Expert These women's versions of expert piste skis are all narrow underfoot, with waist widths in the 70s. This makes them ideal for gripping and carving on firm, groomed snow. Most of them are designed to perform best at speed. Atomic Cloud 11 XT £565 including bindings Best for: Quick direction changes Precise, solid carving machines, they're highly accurate and manoeuvrable. Zippy in short turns, where they are top of the class, they'll get you out of tight spots with alacrity – they share top rank for liveliness/responsiveness. The Clouds provide control on steeps, where it's no effort to keep them turning. The bindings are attached via just one mounting point in the centre of the ski, allowing it to flex freely, but at higher speeds they're less smooth, with a bit of floppiness at the tips. Tech talk Sidewall construction, with a part-poplar wood, part-synthetic core reinforced with titanium. Five per cent tip rocker. + Short turns, liveliness/responsiveness, groomed piste – Smoothness, versatility, off piste, moguls Lengths: 148, 155, 162, 169 Sidecut: 122/71/104 (162) Radius: 13m (162) Blizzard Viva S7 £620 including bindings Best for: Easy-going, stylish skiers The Viva S7s are at their best at slower speeds, where they offer good versatility, responding with energy out of long and short turns. Quite snappy, they're good for long, arcing carves on wide-open groomed slopes, and easier to handle on gentler gradients. They're harder to ride on steeps and become a little twitchy at speed, but suit skiers for whom skill outweighs aggression. Tech talk Sidewall construction with a wood core reinforced with titanium. Tip and tail rockers + Liveliness/responsiveness, groomed piste – Smoothness, off piste, moguls Lengths: 153, 160, 167 Sidecut: 118/70/103 (all lengths) Radius: 11m (160) Dynastar Elite 11 £535 including bindings Best for: Stability as you move through the gears The Elite 11s are consistent in short or long turns and are comfortable skis for those lacking confidence, looking to improve quickly. As you gain assuredness and ramp up the speed, they go with you, offering stability all the way. In fact, they get better with speed and are fun to tear around on, responding superbly with a bounce from turn to turn. Tech talk Sidewall construction with a wood core, strengthened with fibreglass. Tip rocker. + High speed, groomed piste – Versatility, off piste Lengths: 148, 153, 159, 165 Sidecut: 121/72/105 (all lengths) Radius: 14m (165) K2 Luv Machine 74 Ti £530 including bindings Best for: All-mountain versatility Light and flexible, the Luv Machines are easy to ski, topping the group for low-speed skiing. However, they're very responsive and confidence-boosting when you give it some welly. They bounce easily from turn to turn, but are not excessively stiff, so show some forgiveness in bumps, where they are best in class. They act like all-mountain skis and will ski through anything – they're even very capable in deep fresh tracks, where they are among the top scorers. Tech talk Cap construction, with sidewalls underfoot. Titanal-reinforced fir/paulownia/bamboo core. Tip rocker. + Low speed, off piste, moguls – None Lengths: 146, 153, 160, 167 Sidecut: 121/74/107 (all lengths) Radius: 12.5m (160) Nordica Cinnamon 76 Ca £510 including bindings Best for: Stability in all conditions Unbeaten in this group for versatility, these Cinnamons are best at medium speeds and in longer turns, where they're solid on the edge. They're also supremely stable at speed on ice and down steeps. They'll pivot as well as carve, and are perfectly comfortable with a bit of mogul action. Tech talk Sidewall construction with a wood core, supported by two layers of carbon. Multi-radius with a slalom sidecut at the front and a GS sidecut in the middle and tail. Tip rocker. + Edge hold, long turns, smoothness, versatility, groomed piste – Liveliness/responsiveness, off piste Lengths: 144, 150, 156, 162, 168 Sidecut: 124/76/104 (all lengths) Radius: 13m (156) Rossignol Unique 10 £575 including bindings Best for: Holding a turn and springing into the next The Unique 10s provide a solid ride at speed, but don't feel like they'll run away with you. They reward effort with great rebound and grip. Solid and stable, they're good on ice at speed, and push you straight out of one turn into the next. But they are harder work in bumps. Tech talk Partial cap construction with a light, hollowed-out paulownia wood core, stiffened with fibreglass. Ten per cent tip rocker. + Edge hold, high speed, groomed piste – Short turns, low speed, moguls Lengths: 156, 163, 170 Sidecut: 120/72/101 (all lengths) Radius: 15m (163) Salomon W-Max £560 including bindings Best for: Aggressive, high-energy skiers The W-Maxes are smooth and stable (in part thanks to Salomon’s Powerline, a carbon rod running along the topsheet to dampen vibrations), with good edge grip. They reward acceleration and would be good for an aggressive skier prepared to put plenty of effort in. You do have to work harder to get the rebound than with some of their rivals and they are happier carving than pivoting. Ranked among the best of this category for versatility and off piste, they are happy being taken out of their natural environment, too. Tech talk Partial cap construction with a lightweight poplar-wood core, beefed up with titanium. Ten per cent tip rocker. + Versatility, off piste, groomed piste – Short turns, liveliness/responsiveness, moguls Lengths: 150, 155, 160, 165 Sidecut: 120/73/105 (160) Radius: 13m (160) Best on test, Best value Völkl Allura £550 including bindings Best for: Instant gratification on piste These powerhouses initiate turns smoothly, before emerging from them slickly, ready for the next. Fun, lively and responsive, they're very versatile, working at different speeds. They make perfect tiny turns easily, but are also solid at speed, cruising steadfastly through the big turns. Immediately likeable, and easy to get on with, these are ideal for those approaching expert status and looking to progress with confidence. The Alluras beat all-comers in this category for edge hold, long turns, high speed, smoothness and groomed piste, while sharing the plaudits for off piste and liveliness/responsiveness. Tech talk Cap construction, with a wood core, reinforced with steel. They have two ridges running along the edges of the topsheet, to boost grip, and they are rockered at the tip. + Edge hold, long turns, high speed, smoothness, liveliness/responsiveness, off piste, groomed piste – None Lengths: 144, 151, 158, 165 Sidecut: 125/75/96 (all lengths) Radius: 15.3m (158) Telegraphtravel Follow @telegraphtravel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T20:40:41.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
