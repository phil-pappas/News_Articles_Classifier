Annual inflation surged to 58.7% in August from 51.9% the month before, fuelled by a shortage of foreign exchange and higher food prices.\nTransitional period\nAn accord signed by President Salva Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar in August includes commitments by their sides to a monitored cease-fire and sharing of government positions over a 30-month transitional period scheduled to begin 90 days after the agreement.\nViolence has continued in the weeks since the pact, with South Sudan’s army saying dozens of people have been killed in clashes in the country’s north.\n\"The critical thing is what are the South Sudanese willing to put into this,\" Mr Booth said.\n\"They spent vast amounts of money to fight each other for the past 21 months so they should also be willing to put resources into the peace process and rebuilding of the country.\"\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:26:17.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
