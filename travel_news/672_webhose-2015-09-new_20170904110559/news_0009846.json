Source: Supplied \nMr Kyle said the trek tested him beyond the rough sleep-outs and agonising blisters. \n“It’s 95 per cent about your mentality — your body just adapts physically but your mind has to overcome everything,” he said. \n“The challenges are minimal when you are in the right mind frame. \n“I just had to believe in myself and stay positive.” Mitch Kyle takes a break at one of the villages along the trek. Source: Supplied \nWhile the journey Mr Kyle embarked on was impulsive, he said he had no regrets. \nHe has walked through amazing villages and has immersed himself in authentic Spanish culture. \nHe has even made friends for life after sharing just one day of his journey with them. \nDespite doing the trek on his own and often in 35 degree heat, Mr Kyle’s sanity was never compromised. \nThe rolling green hills and the characters he met were enough to keep him going in a place where people were often disconnected from technology. \nWhile Mr Kyle did carry a mobile phone, he did not often use it and he plans to leave it at home when he conquers the trail again in the future. Mitch Kyle conquers the trek, something that he says changed his life. Source: Supplied \nMr Kyle did the trek the “French way” by walking through Basque Country, the Meseta and the Galicia. \nThe Camino Frances route is the most popular in North-West Spain and starts in St Jean Pied de Port in France before finishing in Santiago. \nMr Kyle said a lot of people would not complete the trek for years. \n“Some would do the first part one year and come back the next year to do the next part,” he said. \n“I was just pushed to keep going.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T13:45:38.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
