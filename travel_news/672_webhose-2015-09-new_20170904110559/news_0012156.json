The meningitis B jab is being offered on the NHS from Tuesday for infants aged two months, followed by a second dose at four months and a booster at 12 months. There will also be a temporary catch-up programme for babies who are due their three and four-month vaccinations throughout September. The scheme, which has been delayed by cost disputes , is the first national and publicly-funded programme against the infection in the world. Some infants are too young to receive the vaccine, but can still be exposed to the deadly bacteria Photo: Alamy The jab protects against infection by meningococcal group B bacteria, which can cause meningitis and septicaemia (blood poisoning). While meningitis B can affect people of any age, it is most common in babies and children under five . Tests suggest that the new vaccine, called Bexsero , will protect against around 90 per cent of the meningococcal group-B bacteria strains circulating in the UK. Around 1,200 people - mainly babies and children - get meningitis B each year, with around one in 10 dying from the infection and others left with permanent disabilities. Christopher Head, chief executive of the Meningitis Research Foundation, said: \"We hope this vaccine will save many lives and spare countless families the trauma of seeing a loved one die or become seriously disabled because of meningitis B. \"If cases continue as they have in the past, over the next decade this vaccine could potentially prevent up to 4,000 cases of meningococcal disease in children younger than five in the UK. \"However we must remind the public that there are still some forms of the disease which are not covered by vaccines, so it is vital that people are still aware of the symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia.\" Parents whose babies are being vaccinated have been urged to buy paracetamol to stave off a fever linked to the jab. Under the current immunisation programme, around one quarter of infants are expected to develop a mild fever in the 48 hours after receiving their jabs. However, when the meningitis B vaccination is added, up to 60 per cent of infants are expected to develop such fever. One of the first babies to receive the new jab is the granddaughter of a lifelong meningitis campaigner. Dr Jane Wells, 58, of Stroud, will see her granddaughter, Daisy, born on May 29, vaccinated against the infection as part of the first round of catch-up jabs. Lifelong meningitis campaigner Dr Jane Wells, left, wit nurse Alison Shaw, is delighted her granddaughter Daisy Wells will have the vaccine (Antony Thompson/Meningitis Now/PA) Dr Wells co-founded the charity now known as Meningitis Now, after her son Dan suffered meningitis as a baby and teenager. She said: \"I'm so pleased that Daisy will benefit from the vaccine, it's the perfect gift. Meningitis has been prominent in our family - we have experienced three deaths and my son, Dan, survived the disease twice. With our history, we were very worried for Daisy.\" Mr Wells caught meningitis aged two and again when he was 13. \"When Dan first contracted meningitis it completely changed our lives - we were in a dark hole and no one could tell us anything,\" Dr Wells said. \"No parent or child should have to go through what we did. Dan struggled with his balance, tiredness, sickness and his education for years but luckily his after-effects were minor compared to what they could have been. \"Fortunately, when Dan contracted the disease a second time, treatment and recognition had improved drastically.\" Sue Davie, chief executive of Meningitis Now, said: \"Whilst reaching this milestone is great news, I urge all parents to remain vigilant of the signs and symptoms of meningitis. There are still types for which there is no vaccine available.\" Another meningitis vaccine - Men ACWY - is currently being offered to 17 and 18-year-olds and students starting university this year. Symptoms of meningitis in a baby or young child • a high fever, with cold hands and feet • vomit and refuse to feed • feeling agitated and not want to be picked up • becoming drowsy, floppy and unresponsive • grunt or breathe rapidly • an unusual high-pitched or moaning cry • pale, blotchy skin, and a red rash that doesn't fade when a glass is rolled over it • a tense, bulging soft spot on their head (fontanelle) • a stiff neck and dislike bright lights • convulsions or seizures Putting glass against the skin can help detect meningitis Photo: ALAMY The glass test If you press the side of a clear glass firmly against the skin and the rash doesn't fade, it's a sign of meningococcal septicaemia. A person with septicaemia may have a rash of tiny \"pin pricks\" that later develops into purple bruising. A fever with a rash that doesn't fade under pressure is a medical emergency, and you should seek immediate medical help.
