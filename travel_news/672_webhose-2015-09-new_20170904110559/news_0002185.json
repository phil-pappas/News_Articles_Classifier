And the grossest by far? The tray table Story On the airplane, the dirtiest place by far, a site says, was actually the tray table. \nTravelling can be kind of a nightmare for germ-a-phobes. Whether you go by plane, train or automobile, you’re sure to meet with dirty rest stop bathrooms, crowded trains and buses, or people coughing next to you on the airplane. \nIf that kind of stuff bothers you, this article will not make you feel better. \nTravelmath.com, a site that helps people calculate the driving and flying time between cities, ranked some of the dirtiest places in airports and airplanes, based on 26 samples gathered by a microbiologist sent to examine five airports and four flights. \nUnsurprisingly, they found that airports and airplanes are dirtier than the average home. But the places where they found the most germs in airports and on airplanes might surprise you. \nThe samples gathered show that bathrooms in airplanes and airports actually have fewer germs than other things we consider far less innocuous. On the airplane, the dirtiest place by far was actually the tray table. Their tests found that the tray table had 2,155 “colony forming units” — a measure of the number of bacteria or fungal cells that are able to multiply — per square inch. \nThat compares to 285 on the overhead air vent, only 265 on the lavatory flush button, and 230 on the seat belt buckle. \nIn the airport, the findings were similar: The tests found that drinking fountain buttons had 1,240 colony forming units per square inch, compared to only 70 on bathroom stall locks. \nHere is their ranking of the six locations:1. Tray table – 2,155 CFU/sq. in.2. Drinking fountain buttons – 1,240 CFU/sq. in.3. Overhead air vent – 285 CFU/sq. in.4. Lavatory flush button – 265 CFU/sq. in.5. Seatbelt buckle – 230 CFU/sq. in.6.
