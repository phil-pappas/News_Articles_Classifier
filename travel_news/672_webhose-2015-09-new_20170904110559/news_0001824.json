Published on : Friday, September 11, 2015\nWith some six million people attending every year, the Munich Oktoberfest (Munich Beerfest) is one of the most famous events and the world’s largest fair. One of the easiest ways to enjoy Oktoberfest is to join one of the many Oktoberfest Tours on offer. With your accommodation and transport taken care of all there is for you to do is to enjoy Oktoberfest 2015.\nWhile the event reinforces stereotypical images of beer-loving, meat-loving Germans dressed in dirndls and lederhosen, visitors to the annual event come from all over the world. Oktoberfest is in fact one of Munich’s largest and most profitable tourist attractions. It brings over 450 million euros to the city’s coffers each year.\nThe Oktoberfest Camping in Munich-Riem is Munich’s largest campsite during the Oktoberfest. Listen to live brass bands playing traditional Bavarian music or soak up in beer, you will definitely enjoy yourself with hundreds of other people from all over the world, dancing and singing the hours away. Witness a varied succession of regional costume groups, “troops” in historical uniforms, marching bands, riflemen, thoroughbred horses, oxen, cows, goats, the decorated drays of the Munich breweries, floats displaying typical local traditions and historic carriages all pass by in a 7-kilometer-long procession through the streets of the city center.\nBetween events and beer tents, guests can traverse the 103 acre Oktoberfest grounds to ride a Ferris wheel, roller coaster, or water slide, navigate their way through a labyrinth, visit a haunted house, be entertained by numerous types of performers, take a look at the flea circus, stop off at one of dozens of game booths, or take a festival tour, among other things.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T09:49:35.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
