He points out that the average adult will get about 2.5 colds a year -- and those who fall below that mark are probably doing so because they're taking the right precautions. If you're seated next to someone suffering from a cold (and even if you're not), Genreau suggests turning on the air above your seat when you first sit down to a low to medium stream, so that when you put your hand out in front of your face, you'll feel a current (but not so high that it's uncomfortably cold). Once the air is on, clean your hands with a sanitizer made from at least 60 percent alcohol, Genreau suggests, and then avoid touching any mucous membranes, including your mouth, eyes and nose. Drinking plenty of water can also help to rehydrate dried-out mucous membranes from the flight. Before you travel, Genreau suggests trying elderberry extract or North American Ginseng, both of which have some science behind their immune-boosting effects. And finally, get good sleep before and after you travel, says travel medical expert Brenda Powell, M.D., of the Cleveland Clinic's Center for Integrative Medicine. \"Being sleep-deprived takes a toll on the immune system.\" Air cabins are typically pressurized to 8,000 feet, Powell explains, which will result in very dry air that can ultimately dry out the respiratory tract and make you more vulnerable to infections. Genreau says he typically recommends drinking at least 5 to 6 ounces of water for every three hours in flight. (Not in the mood to pay jacked-up prices for after-security water bottles? We suggest bringing your own bottle with a built-in filter to refill from the water fountain by your gate.) And yep, that advice about not over-indulging on alcohol while you're a mile high is probably true. While a drink or two, especially if it's part of your typical routine, is fine, anything beyond that can become dehydrating. And be careful of any alcohol intake if you're on an anti-anxiety medication from your doctor to cope with a fear of flying. Moving a few hours east or west can take a few days to get used to -- and by that time you'll be ready to head back home after the holiday! Powell suggests easing the transition by setting your watch to the new time zone as soon as you get on the plane. It's fine to take a nap if you have a some time before your new bedtime. If you arrive in daytime, resist the urge to fall asleep and get outside to soak up some natural sunlight, Powell says. About a half hour before going to bed, take between 1 and 3 milligrams of melatonin to naturally reset your clock. Bedbugs are the last thing you want hitching a free ride on your suitcase -- but it can happen, especially for a nuisance that has earned itself the nickname of \"hitchhiker.\" Missy Henriksen of the National Pest Management Association says the ideal situation is to keep your belongings up off the floor and as close to you as possible. But, as that's often not an option, you can also cover bags with a plastic bag, either one made specially for that purpose or a plain-old Ziploc. \"It may not be the fashion statement that you're looking to make,\" she says, \"but it certainly can help provide a little extra layer of precaution between your items and bedbugs.\" \"Bedbugs like to go in the nooks and crannies and cracks and crevices of items,\" Henriksen explains. As soon as you re-collect your luggage, search for unwanted hitchikers in the seams, zippers and pockets of all bags, laptop cases and purses. Bedbugs look like thin apple seeds -- if you do spot something, isolate the item right away. Wash and/or dry the items inside -- Henriksen says anything over 122 degrees Fahrenheit will kill off the bugs. And use a handheld vacuum to go over your luggage. Bedbugs instinctually come out in search for their next meal, so be wary of trunks of cabs and public transit. And consider opting for hard-shell luggage with fewer of those nooks and crannies for bugs to hide in. Powell suggests trying ginger capsules, acupressure bands for the wrist and attempting to look out at the horizon. Motion sickness occurs, she explains, when your inner ear is detecting one thing and your eyes are detecting another -- in other words, when you are seeing motion but your body is still, you can become nauseous. Powell says to choose a moving object in the distance to focus on (harder if you're on a plane than in a car -- look for something that swings from the ceiling). If you know you get sick, volunteer to take the first shift of driving, because once motion sickness starts, it is very difficult to treat. And if you get airsick, skip heavy, greasy airport food and pick light carbs instead. When 29-year-old Serena Williams was hospitalized for a pulmonary embolism earlier this year after a plane ride, it shed light on the serious health problem, which can be exacerbated from sitting on a plane for too long. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot formed deep in the body, often in the lower leg or thigh, according to the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. That clot can then break off and travel through the bloodstream -- if it moves into an artery in the lung, blocking blood flow, it is known as a pulmonary embolism, which is a very serious condition. There is evidence, Genreau explains, that airplane travel can increase DVT risk, probably because of the immobilization -- and being in a window seat seems to increase that likelihood. He suggests exercising your feet and legs for a few minutes every hour by rocking up onto your toes and rocking back onto your heels. Better yet, take a walk every hour or so. \"If you can, it's a good thing to get up and go to the back of the aircraft,\" he says. \"You can get a bottle of water and bring it back.\" Turns out, being well hydrated not only staves off a cold, but it may also keep you from developing a clot. Symptoms of deep vein thrombosis include pain, swelling, warmth and redness, according to MedicineNet, while symptoms of a pulmonary embolism may include shortness of breath, chest pain and cough -- if you experience these, seek immediate medical attention. At the airport: If you only have a few minutes before boarding, your best pick may be the gate-side newsstands. \"You'd be surprised, but many of these stands are looking healthier,\" says HuffPost blogger Dawn Jackson Blatner, a registered dietitian and author of \"The Flexitarian Diet.\" Look for fruit cups, small hummus containers with crackers, string cheese, nuts and yogurt. \"If worse gets to worse, a piece of fruit and a protein bar can hit the spot,\" she says. \"And don't forget the water to stay hydrated during the flight.\" If you have a bit of a wait, Blatner points out that coffee shops like Starbucks have portioned boxed meal and snack options, which even advertise the calorie count right on the container. If you're in a sea of fast food, avoid meal deals, pick grilled over crispy, swap fruit or veggies for fries, and select unsweetened iced tea or water over sugary drinks and soda. On the road: The best bet, of course, is to pack your own snack. Blatner suggests a cooler with pre-made sandwiches, wraps or pita pockets, clementines, bags of grapes, a pack of apple slices, portioned packs of nut butter, nuts, air-popped popcorn, veggie sticks and hummus, string cheese, whole-grain crackers and frozen bottles to keep food cold. If you're not that prepared and come across a rest-stop vending machine, Blatner says to opt for a granola bar, bags of sunflower seeds, bags of peanuts or trail mix. And if you're at a roadside restaurant, take a look at the airport fast-food advice, as it applies here, too. Flights are very drying to the skin, says Carmindy, the makeup artist behind TLC's \"What Not To Wear.\" Instead of boarding with your makeup on, she suggests starting the flight out by only wearing moisturizer. About halfway through the flight, reapply, and even spritz your face with water from an atomizer if you're feeling dry. Stay hydrated throughout the flight and head to the bathroom to apply makeup about five minutes before you begin your descent. \"If you go on that plane, and you have makeup on already, you're going to feel dry and cakey,\" she says. \"This lets you rehydrate your skin, so it feels fresh.\" Well, pretty germy. While the World Health Organization has compiled a guide to aviation hygiene and sanitation, Genreau points out that these standards are put together by the industry itself. And for quick turnovers on domestic flights, the flight crew is also the cleaning crew. \"They do very minimal stuff,\" he says. \"It can be a potentially dirty place.\" Genreau explains that one 2009 analysis found samples of MRSA, an antibiotic resistant bacteria, on seat-back trays. And the germiest places of all on the plane? Perhaps unsurprisingly, they include the faucet handle in the bathroom and the doorknob on the inside of the bathroom. To tackle the first, he says you can put 4 or 5 drops of a 60-percent alcohol or greater hand sanitizer on a tissue. Then, wipe down your tray. For the latter, hand sanitizer is your best friend yet again. Genreau advises washing and drying your hands in the bathroom, but then sanitizing your hands again when you get back to your seat.  Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T15:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T03:08:41.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
