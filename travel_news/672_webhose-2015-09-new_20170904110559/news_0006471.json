The sailboat operator, Shreedhar Madavapeddi, received 17 broken ribs, and passenger Kathleen Larsen suffered shoulder and head injuries.\nAt the sentencing Friday, Senior Deputy Prosecutor Amy Freedheim asked the judge to impose the maximum sentence of 68 months, pointing out that Hicks previously had been investigated for DUI. She noted that had Hicks hit someone with his car, he would have received a more severe sentence.\nThe judge also heard emotional testimonies from both of Protz’ parents, who have filed a wrongful-death suit against Hicks , and watched a video from her former students.\nHicks’ defense attorney, Richard Hansen, maintained that Hicks was not the only boat operator at fault for the crash and asked the judge for community service or work release. A friend of Hicks and his pastor both testified that Hicks donates his time to help the less fortunate, and that his time would be better spent serving the community than behind bars.\nJudge Schapira got choked up discussing the accident.\n“There was significant danger not only because of the darkness but also because of an exceptionally, unusually impaired operator of the sailboat,” Schapira said.\n“There are just no winners here,” John Protz, Melissa’s father, said after the sentencing. “Everybody’s lost.”\nInformation from The Seattle Times archives is included in this story.Sami Edge: 206-464-3195 or sedge@seattletimes.com .
