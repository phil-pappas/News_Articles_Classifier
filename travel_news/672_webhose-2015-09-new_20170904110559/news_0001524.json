(AP) â€” AAA Michigan projects roughly 1.2 million Michigan residents will travel away from home this Labor Day weekend, the most since 2008.\nThe Dearborn-based auto club said Monday that its projections for people who will travel 50 miles or more from home between Thursday and Monday is an increase of about 1.5 percent over last year.\nAAA Michigan says gas prices could be the lowest seen in a decade for Labor Day weekend, with the state's average for regular unleaded gasoline at $2.50 per gallon on Monday. Auto club spokeswoman Susan Hiltz says an improving economy is contributing to the increase in travel.\nAbout 89 percent of Michigan travelers are expected to drive, and roughly 4 percent are projected to travel by air.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T10:43:59.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
