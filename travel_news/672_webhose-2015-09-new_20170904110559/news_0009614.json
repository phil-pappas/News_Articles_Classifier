After users have registered for an account, they use Facebook to build their profile and then sign in at their respective airport.\nUsers who are members of lounges can use the app to pick a guest they would like to accompany them, and travellers outside of lounges can pick a lounge they’d like to get in to.\nThe app says it is about letting travellers “meet and mingle” or “just do a favour to other passengers”, giving users the opportunity to gain access to lounges worldwide.\nJust download the app to your phone and away you go.

But when she logs onto her Lounger app, she is instantly connected with another solo male at the airport and before long they are both sitting in the lounge chatting animatedly over a glass of wine.\nCo-founder Roeder told Escape that the idea came about after noticing lonely travellers outside of airport lounges.\n“Jessika Nilsson and I are both frequent flyers for several years (both of us became Star Alliance Gold in our early twenties) and we have combined spent thousands of hours in airport lounges being bored and waiting for our departure, which is often delayed.\n“This got us to think on how improve the airport of experience of frequent flyers but also other passengers who might fly once or twice per year,” he says.\n“Most frequent flyers with lounge access can bring a companion to the lounge as well but merely make use of it in one out of 20 cases. Thus there’s a heavy under-utilisation of their companion tickets for lounge access.\n“At the same time non-elite travellers (more than 95 per cent of people at airports) never get to see what’s behind the millionaire doors of the Heathrows, JFKs, Hanedas, or Kingsfords of this world.\n“So Lounger aims to provide more travellers with perks in airport club and at the same time make waiting for your flight a more social experience where you can meet you future best friend, business partner, travel mate, or love.”\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8qQCxQrLQc\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=%26%238216%3BTinder+for+travellers%26%238217%3B+launches&c=SINGLE+travellers+rejoice%2C+a+new+app+is+helping+lonely+frequent+flyers+find+love+at+airports+connecting+strangers+who+are+in+limbo+between+flights.&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/lounger-app-is-like-tinder-for-frequent-flyers-pairing-up-lonely-travellers-at-airports-worldwide/story-fn6yjmoc-1227510820370?sv=90fbd6c17c917fca4f7f6438d368ace3", "http://loungerapp.com/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8qQCxQrLQc", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/lounger-app-is-like-tinder-for-frequent-flyers-pairing-up-lonely-travellers-at-airports-worldwide/story-fn6yjmoc-1227510820370?sv=90fbd6c17c917fca4f7f6438d368ace3", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/lounger-app-is-like-tinder-for-frequent-flyers-pairing-up-lonely-travellers-at-airports-worldwide/story-fn6yjmoc-1227510820370?sv=90fbd6c17c917fca4f7f6438d368ace3&h=%26%238216%3BTinder+for+travellers%26%238217%3B+launches", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/lounger-app-is-like-tinder-for-frequent-flyers-pairing-up-lonely-travellers-at-airports-worldwide/story-fn6yjmoc-1227510820370?sv=90fbd6c17c917fca4f7f6438d368ace3", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/lounger-app-is-like-tinder-for-frequent-flyers-pairing-up-lonely-travellers-at-airports-worldwide/story-fn6yjmoc-1227510820370?sv=90fbd6c17c917fca4f7f6438d368ace3&title=%26%238216%3BTinder+for+travellers%26%238217%3B+launches", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/lounger-app-is-like-tinder-for-frequent-flyers-pairing-up-lonely-travellers-at-airports-worldwide/story-fn6yjmoc-1227510820370?sv=90fbd6c17c917fca4f7f6438d368ace3&title=%26%238216%3BTinder+for+travellers%26%238217%3B+launches"], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T06:44:22.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
