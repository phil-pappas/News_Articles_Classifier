Lewis Katz, co-owner of the Philadelphia Inquirer newspaper, and six other people died in the crash. (AP Photo/Boston Herald, Mark Garfinkel, Pool, file) \nBOSTON (AP) â€” Federal investigators say the crew of a jet that crashed in Massachusetts last year, killing a Philadelphia newspaper co-owner and six others , did not perform a pre-flight check and failed to disengage a safety mechanism before takeoff. Lewis Katz AP File Photo \nThe National Transportation Safety Board announced the results Wednesday of the investigation into the May 2014 crash in Bedford. Philadelphia Inquirer co-owner Lewis Katz was among those killed. \nThe Gulfstream G-IV business jet overran the runway, crashed into a ravine and caught fire. Lewis Katz saved Dickinson Law School in Carlisle, longtime friend says \nThe NTSB said the crew engaged a device that prevents control surfaces from moving when the jet is parked, but did not disengage it before takeoff. The system was meant to prevent the throttle from being moved more than 6 degrees, but the throttle was moved almost four times that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T23:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T03:14:09.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
