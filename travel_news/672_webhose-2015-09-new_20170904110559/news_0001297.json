A decade ago it was unusual for someone to work from home or be “off-site” unless they had a specific reason to be. Today, it’s more unusual for a business not to offer a wide range of flexible choices as standard. There are many benefits to flexible workforces, including improved morale, agile working practices and optimised recruitment from a wider talent pool than just your local market. Businesses with flexible conditions therefore benefit in a variety of ways. Red tape is a continuing challenge to setting up a flexible working environment By not being tied to an office, staff members can be on the road visiting clients, partners and suppliers, improving links in these areas while keeping in the loop on day-to-day work. But a flexible working structure requires considerable planning and some investment for businesses to realise the full benefits. Thankfully the cost of maintaining a flexible communications network and business infrastructure has come down, so small and medium enterprises (SMEs) can get in on the act as well as large corporates. By combining mobile technology and cloud software, SME owners can use their devices to communicate on the go and even oversee projects online as they develop. The cloud allows people to contribute to tasks from anywhere, giving advice, updating documents and approving jobs wherever they are in the world. Do something different: firms who optimise flexible working have the opportunity to differentiate themselves from the competition Photo: Alamy Business owners can also make use of this technology by printing and scanning documents directly from their devices, allowing, for example, senior directors to sign important contracts without them needing to be present at company headquarters. In this agile market, it is unsurprising that many growing businesses see efficiency as a real business benefit, while red tape and bureaucracy is considered a real drag on progress. A recent survey commissioned by Canon questioned more than 1,000 SMEs across Europe and asked them for their views on the subject. Nearly half said that red tape is a continuing challenge to setting up a flexible working environment and a third said they had too much paperwork to get through. There are many benefits to flexible workforces, including improved morale, agile working practices and optimised recruitment for wider talent Conversely, the majority of respondents said the need to be more efficient is a key consideration when upgrading their technology. Some 65pc said it was the critical factor they considered when investing in print hardware. Flexible and efficient working practices are widespread, yet firms who optimise these areas have the opportunity to differentiate themselves from the competition. They can get more done in less time and ultimately grow the business faster than less evolved rivals. Reap the benefits of a flexible working environment with Canon’s MAXIFY inkjet printer range.
