The master development will also feature an academy and campus, museum, wellness centre, retail, commercial offices, residential housing and a mosque housing 10,000 worshippers. \nAli Hamad Lakhraim Alzaabi, President & CEO, Millennium & Copthorne Hotels MEA said the new hotels will help to address the undersupply of branded hotels in Madinah. \n“The hospitality industry in the Holy City of Madinah is witnessing remarkable growth due to a rise in religious tourism as well as the thriving economy. There is currently an undersupply of branded hotels with international standards and we are confident that our expansion plans will help address this.” \nThe move follows the signing of four hotels in Madinah and Riyadh earlier this year and is part of Millennium & Copthorne’s strategy to open over 20 hotels in the Kingdom within the next five years and 100 hotels across the Middle East by 2020.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T11:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T15:47:24.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
