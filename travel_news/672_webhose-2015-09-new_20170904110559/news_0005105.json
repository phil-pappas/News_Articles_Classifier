This transaction also includes one used Boeing 737-700 (MSN 33103) and two used Boeing 737-800 aircraft (MSNs 33104 and 34242). The deliveries are scheduled to begin in 2015 and continue through to 2019. \nOman Air’s Chief Financial Officer, Japeen Shah, said, “We are very pleased to sign these agreements with Air Lease Corporation. They enable Oman Air to continue its ambitious fleet and network expansion program, and deliver even greater choice and convenience for our customers. Our expansion plan will see Oman Air’s fleet expand to 57 aircraft by 2018, and to 70 aircraft by 2020.
