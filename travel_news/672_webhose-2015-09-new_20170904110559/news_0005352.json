Peter Braig \nRichard Branson (L) gets a lessson from Luke Mangan on how to make meals look good. \nMy effort – a mix of corn, mayonnaise and spices, topped with prawns – has not worked out particularly well, but it just goes to show that it's not as easy to create great-looking food as it might seem. \n\"Half the beauty of food is the presentation,\" Sir Richard said. \"Your food might taste just the same, but if it looks like someone has just thrown up on your plate, you're not going to give it a try.\" \n\"Thirty years ago when we first started in the airline business, you were lucky to get a lump of chicken dumped in your lap, cold chicken. There was no choice of food – it was absolutely horrible.\" CRAIG PLATT/TRAVELLER \nNot quite right: The writer's attempt at plating up a business class meal. \nBut as recently as six years ago there was still plenty to complain about. Famously, a complaint letter about a Virgin Atlantic meal, dubbed \"the greatest complaint letter of all time\" went viral and made its way to Branson himself. \nPhrases like \"It appears to be in an evidence bag from the scene of a crime. A CRIME AGAINST BLOODY COOKING\" saw the letter get shared widely online. \nBranson himself thought the letter was hilarious at the time and even invited the writer to come and visit Virgin Atlantic's food preparation facilities and give his feedback. \nWhat business class food is supposed to look like on Virgin Australia. \nBut times have certainly changed. Ad Feedback \n\"Now, to try to aspire to be as good as the best restaurant on the ground, but in the air, that's the challenge and we're excited to do it,\" Branson said. \n\"I think some airlines have got it right, but some airlines have still go a long way to go. I wouldn't say that the airline industry, as a whole, is brilliant at food … some airlines do it really well and that helps set them apart.\" \nVirgin Australia is not the only airline to involve a high-profile chef in creating its meals. Qantas has Neil Perry on board, while Heston Blumenthal consults for British Airways, and Air France has Michelin superstar Joel Robuchon. \nMangan's Mojo is located in a Danks Street warehouse and is home to the test kitchen that the chef uses to try out new recipes for the airline and train flight attendants on how to assemble the meals . \nMangan has developed menus for business, premium economy and economy class as well as the airline's airport lounges since starting with the airline in 2010. \nThe celebrity chef said meals that will be served on a plane need to be adjusted to the environment. \n\"You lose about 30 per cent of your sense of taste in the air (at altitude), funnily enough,\" Mangan said. \"We need to adjust for the taste sense. We use a lot of fragrant spices. We might use a little bit more lemon juice in a dressing or a little bit more vinegar to enhance that flavour.\" \nAnd as one of the world's most frequent flyers, what does Branson himself prefer to consume on a flight? \n\"I generally avoid heavy meat … I'd rather go for salmon or something lighter. A glass of red wine goes down well.\" \nThe writer travelled to Sydney as a guest of Virgin Australia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T21:54:19.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
