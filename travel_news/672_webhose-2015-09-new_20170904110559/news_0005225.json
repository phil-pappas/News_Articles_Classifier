Box 21828 - 00100,Nairobi,Kenya, 22 September 2015 -- Kenya is one of the most sought after travel destinations in East Africa. Boasting some of the best game reserves in the region and a uniquely wide array of game life, Kenya offers its visitors unforgettable African safari experience. A safari in Kenya is indeed very rewarding and it guarantees you a chance to see the Big 5 - buffalo, leopard, lion, rhino and elephant. Lake Turkana, the largest desert lake in the world is the main attraction in the arid northeastern region of Kenya. Enclosed by lava beds and extinct volcanoes, Lake Turkana is adjacent to the Kenya-Ethiopia border and has an interesting history. Koobi Fora in the Sibiloi National Park on the northeastern shores of the lake is often referred to as the cradle of mankind. The site is a literal hotbed for fossils including a three million year old giant turtle and the remains of a three million year old hominid. The region is ideal for bird watching, fishing as well as other water sports. Many miles away from the arid northeastern region, the central Kenya region has numerous tourist attractions but Mount Kenya seems to overshadow them all. At a height of 5199 meters, the mountain is the tallest peak in Kenya - and the second tallest mountain of Africa. Mount Kenya is regarded as a sacred mountain among the tribes that dwell on its foothills. The mountain has snowcapped summits that can be seen from miles away in the plains. Plant life on Mount Kenya varies with height meaning that the species at the foothills is different from the species at the glaciers. You will be able to spot 13 different species of plants on Mount Kenya. Many tourists acknowledge the fact that the national parks and game reserves of Kenya are the country's premier safari destinations. Masai Mara is easily the most popular and most sought after national park in Kenya. Situated on the Kenya-Tanzania border, Masai Mara is renowned for the Great Wildebeest Migration that occurs around July every year. The event sees thousands - at times millions- of wildebeest migrating from the neighbouring Serengeti National park in Tanzania in search for better pastures. The reverse migration occurs around October and November. The Masai Mara is a must for everyone planning a safari to Kenya. The Amboseli National reserve and Tsavo National Park, situated further south of Kenya are also quite fascinating. The Amboseli offers endless views of the African grassland only disrupted by the snowcapped peak of Mount Kilimanjaro - the highest peak in Africa. The national park is famous for its large herds of elephants. On its part, Tsavo is the largest national park in Kenya and it hosts more than 60 mammal species and close to 1000 plant species. The national park is a perfect safari destination for those on holiday at the Kenyan coast. Most international visitors access Kenya by air mainly through Jomo Kenyatta and Mombasa international airports. Jomo Kenyatta International airport in Nairobi, situated some 20 km outside the city centre, is best for visitors who want to go on safari around the country. Passports valid for 3 months from date of entry are required of all visitors. In addition, all visitors are also required to have a visa except for citizens for citizens of some commonwealth countries.
