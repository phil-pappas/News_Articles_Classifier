Well, let’s just say the time from farm to freezer is measured in hours, not days, since all the milk comes from the University of Connecticut’s cows on nearby Horsebarn Hill. The dairy bar still uses its original recipe from the early 1900s and has been selling ice cream to the public for more than 60 years. Behind the counter, hard-working servers sport black T-shirts that say “sweetest course on campus.” Choose from two dozen flavors — we’re partial to salted caramel crunch with chocolate sprinkles — and grab a seat at a small round table or take your dish or cone outside to umbrella-shaded picnic tables. Each year UConn’s graduating class comes up with a new flavor; this year’s “senior scoop” is S’more Husky Pride, vanilla ice cream with brownie and graham cracker swirl. Most weekdays between 11 and 2, you can watch ice cream being made on-site through floor-to-ceiling windows guarded by a statue of a husky, UConn’s mascot. The dairy bar also sells half gallons, ice cream pies and cakes, farm-fresh eggs, and a variety of cheeses made in the creamery. If you have time, head over to the Kellogg Dairy Center,where you can watch milking every afternoon – and say thank you.\nUConn Dairy Bar , 3636 Horsebarn Hill Road Extension, 860-486-1021, www.dining.uconn.edu/uconn-dairy-bar .", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Ftravel%2F2015%2F09%2F05%2Ffood-find-uconn-diary-bar%2F62vPN60oYt1fnUZOBpr8oI%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=UConn", "https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Ftravel%2F2015%2F09%2F05%2Ffood-find-uconn-diary-bar%2F62vPN60oYt1fnUZOBpr8oI%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&media=//c.o0bg.com/rw/Boston/2011-2020/2015/08/24/BostonGlobe.com/Travel/Images/UConnDairyBar1A.jpg&description=UConn", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=UConn", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Ftravel%2F2015%2F09%2F05%2Ffood-find-uconn-diary-bar%2F62vPN60oYt1fnUZOBpr8oI%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=UConn", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Ftravel%2F2015%2F09%2F05%2Ffood-find-uconn-diary-bar%2F62vPN60oYt1fnUZOBpr8oI%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tUConn", "http://www.dining.uconn.edu/uconn-dairy-bar"], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T23:56:03.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
