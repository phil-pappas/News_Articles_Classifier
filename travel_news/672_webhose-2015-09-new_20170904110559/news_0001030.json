Passengers enjoyed non-stop service from Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport to Pittsburgh International Airport.\n“Pittsburgh has a rich history and strong identity,” said Robert Deluce, president and CEO of Porter Airlines. “Passengers travelling to and from Pittsburgh will now enjoy much lower, competitive airfares. Bringing Porter’s well-known customer experience to the city is something that we believe this market will immediately come to appreciate.”\nThe airline is known for providing a premium passenger experience, including leather seats, complimentary wine and beer onboard, and airport lounge access. Its ‘flying refined’ approach has helped make Porter the Best Regional Airline in North America two years running at the Skytrax World Airline Awards.\n“We’re very happy to welcome Porter to Allegheny County and are grateful for the company’s commitment to serving western Pennsylvania business and leisure travellers from Pittsburgh International Airport,” Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald said. “Porter is the most recent example of the positive momentum that we’re seeing at the airport with both the numbers of flights and passengers continuing to grow.”\nPittsburgh was recently named one of the “Top 15 Places to Go in 2015″ by Condé Nast Traveler. The city offers great food, outdoor adventure, history and culture, covering many points of interest for the Canadian traveller.\n“We’re excited to welcome Porter Airlines and their world-renowned customer service to Pittsburgh International Airport as our newest international airline. This is the start of a great partnership between the airport and Porter,” Allegheny County Airport Authority CEO Christina Cassotis said. “Having nonstop access to Toronto City Airport will be a convenient destination for travellers headed to Canada’s largest city as well as other connecting cities in Canada.”\nPeople flying to Toronto will benefit from Porter landing in the heart of downtown at Billy Bishop Airport. This gives Pittsburgh access to the city like never before, with the financial and entertainment districts just 2.5 km or 1.5 miles from the terminal.\nThe airport’s convenient Toronto Islands location now includes access to the recently-opened pedestrian tunnel. This connects the airport with the mainland in approximately six minutes, saving passengers valuable time. Ferry service is in place for vehicle access and as a secondary pedestrian crossing.\nSource:- Porter Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T18:04:58.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
