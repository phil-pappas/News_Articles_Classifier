Mad River currently is closed for the season and management is thankful there are no reports of any injuries. The company has no information at this time as to the cause of the fire.\nTimothy D. Boyd, president and chief executive officer, said, “The loss of the main lodge at Mad River is a sad event for those who support this resort, which has been in operation for 54 years and an important part of the Peak Resorts family for 14 years. But, we are very pleased to be able to report that preliminary information indicates that along with no injuries, the property damage will only affect our food and beverage services this winter, a situation we expect to be able to address with temporary facilities.\n“Peak Resorts is committed to the Mad River resort, and we are already moving ahead to create a plan for the upcoming ski season. We will be onsite beginning today to talk with the Mad River team, meet with the company’s insurance representative and start planning solutions to address temporary facilities, while ensuring our ski operations are dually engaged for this year’s ski season and going forward. We will provide more information as it becomes available,” Boyd added.\nThe company noted that at the time of its initial public offering in November 2014, Mad River accounted for approximately 7 percent of the company’s revenues.\nSource:- Peak Resorts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T08:38:45.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
