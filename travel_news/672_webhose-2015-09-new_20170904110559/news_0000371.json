We landed at Hong Kong airport in the late afternoon so by the time we made our way to the hotel and cruised around Victoria Harbour on a junk boat, it was already 9pm. \nWe weren’t organised enough to have picked out a place so it was a scramble on our mobiles to find somewhere nearby that had good reviews from locals. The first sign that we’d chosen the right place, Cloudnine in Tsim Sha Tsui, was the distinct lack of travellers — everyone sitting in the room was spiritedly chatting in Cantonese. Score. \nWe settled for four dishes, including one of Hong Kong’s signature offerings — crispy roasted pork belly. Forget about the best smoky bacon you’ve ever had — you’ve not tasted the best a pig can offer until you’ve had this dish in Hong Kong. The meat is succulent while the crackling is perfectly crispy. Pair it with a tiny bit of mustard and it will have you making a pact involving your future first born and the devil if you can just eat this every day for the rest of your life. \nThe beef strips, fried eggplant and scallop fried rice we gobble down also delights but nothing compares to those first few mouthfuls of crispy roasted pork. There are only a few pieces of pork in this picture because we’d already eaten the rest! Source: news.com.au \nThe next morning, we make it our mission to go to Tim Ho Wan, the Michelin-starred yum cha joint where you can eat like a king for a handful of change. After circling Central station and the International Finance Centre twice, we give up and ask the information desk. Tim Ho Wan is under renovations for another two weeks. Devastated. \nI call my friend in New York, who lived in Hong Kong for two years, and he tells me there’s another great yum cha place a few minutes away — Maxim’s Palace in City Hall. \nMaxim’s is one of the few yum cha places left that still does it the way Australians are used to — picking your dishes off carts as they snake around the room. Maxim’s is also pure opulence in that it has proper silver ware (cutlery and teapot), probably a hangover from the British imperialism days. The food here is as good as any of the better yum cha places you’ll find in Sydney or Melbourne. \nBut we cut it short after four plates because we want to have a second lunch of that other Hong Kong specialty — barbecued meats. \nOur mate said his favourite place to get roast goose and barbecue (char siu) pork was a hole-in-the-wall eatery on Stanley Street. What he failed to mention was its name, and by that time it was the middle of the night in New York so I couldn’t exactly ask him. \nThankfully, Stanley Street isn’t that long and I spot three restaurants with golden brown goose hanging off hooks in the window. Only one of them, Yat Lok, had a crowd of people hanging out the front. Luckily, most of them are waiting for takeaway orders and we’re quickly ushered in by the woman out the front. If you want to avoid the crowd, go after lunch. Yes, we went back and took this photo about two hours later. Source: news.com.au \nIt’s a no-frills room with simple tables adorned with various sauces and drums of plastic chopsticks. Seeing the confusion on our faces, we’re quickly handed an English menu. The whole place is buzzing with workers from nearby businesses and it’s completely packed out. \nMy partner and I both order the combo plate of barbecue pork and roast goose with rice and a couple of soft drinks. It’s incredible. The pork is juicy and just the right balance of sweet and savoury while the goose is blessed with crispy skin, melty fat and moist meat. And I’m not usually a huge fan of poultry (unless it’s really great duck), but this goose is making me look at our feathered friends in a whole new way. The whole meal cost only $HK120 (about $A22). Can’t decide between pork or goose? Have both. Source: news.com.au \nDinner found us westward on Hong Kong Island in North Point, just a tram ride from Central. My partner led us here to Tung Po, after seeing it on an Anthony Bourdain episode. When we first walked up to where the restaurant is housed, I was convinced we had the wrong place. Surely, I thought, amazing seafood wasn’t going to be found within the brutalist Municipal Services Building? \nSo with great scepticism, I followed him up a few escalators on the side of the building, past the second floor vegetable market. On the top floor, in a cavernous open space, are a handful of eateries. Tung Po takes up the bulk of the space in the middle with its fish tanks, flimsy tables, blue plastic stools and toilet paper as serviettes. Not the most up-market of joints but the food is great. Source: news.com.au \nWe order the signature squid with squid ink spaghetti and a fried fish with sweet corn dipping soup. But it was the morsels of sauteed razor clams that really shined. I forego all claims to dignity and just suck every last bit of that sauce off my fingers — shame be damned. I even forgave the capsicum (my mortal enemy) on the plate. Seriously delicious razor clams. Source: news.com.au \nThe next day found us hunting out one of the other Tim Ho Wan outlets — I was determined to try the famed baked barbecue pork buns. We make our way to Olympic on Kowloon island. We order the buns as well as three kinds of dumplings, a rice noodle and congee. The dumplings are divine while the congee is incredibly satisfying. The rice noodle filled with pork liver is not to my taste but my partner, who loves liver and the offal parts of any animal, enjoys it. Succulent pork and prawn dim sim. Source: news.com.au \nBut the hero (to borrow the parlance from reality TV cooking shows) of the meal is those buns. THOSE BUNS. Unlike the traditional barbecue pork buns you get at yum cha, Tim Ho Wan’s is not that white, soft, floury bao. It’s more like the pastry you might find in a custard bun at a Chinese bakery. It’s slightly crispy on top and just the right amount of sweetness. The tendrils of pork filling with that delicious, sticky sauce is heavenly. I could’ve lapped up a whole bowl of just that pork filling. No words can do these buns justice. Source: news.com.au \nEven though we were already full, we order another serving of those pork buns. Stomach constraints will not stand in my way. \nWe’re flying out that night and have to be at the airport about dinner time so we decide to while away the afternoon doing something very British, in homage to the Crown’s 99-year rule of the archipelago. High tea, or as it’s known in Hong Kong, afternoon tea. \nThere are several high-end choices for high tea in Hong Kong with most luxury hotels offering their own version. After tossing up between The Peninsula, the Mandarin Oriental and the Intercontinental, we pick the latter for its position and views of Victoria Harbour. \nServed in the lobby lounge, the Intercontinental’s tea service is a gastronomic feast, but, you know, a classy one. No finger licking here. Good food, good views — what more could you ask for? Source: news.com.au \nRelieved to find respite from the heat in the hotel’s air conditioning we tuck into the moist scones. The earl grey jelly smeared on the scones is a flavour explosion in your mouth. It’s sweet without being overpowering and has that subtle tea taste. I would’ve preferred traditional finger sandwiches to the savoury eclair-esque delicacies we got but the petit fours were heavenly. \nWe spend almost two hours staring out at Victoria Harbour while attentive staff kept topping up our teapots, before departing for the airport where I downed a perfectly acceptable (especially for airport food) barbecue pork and noodles combo while staring at the ginormous line for the McDonald’s.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T12:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T17:33:45.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
