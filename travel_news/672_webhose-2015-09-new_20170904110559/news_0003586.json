The parade last Thursday in Tiananmen Square marked the 70th anniversary of victory in the Chinese People’s War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression (1937-45) and the end of the Second World War in 1945. President Xi Jinping delivered a speech before the parade to call people to commemorate the hard-won peace after years of bloody war that had inflicted heavy losses on China and other countries.

But he warned that the world is far from tranquil although peace and development have become the prevailing trend. “War is the sword of Damocles that still hangs over mankind. We must learn the lessons of history and dedicate ourselves to peace,” he said. Ravaging Asia, Europe, Africa and Oceania, the wars inflicted more than 100 million military and civilian casualties. China suffered more than 35 million casualties and the Soviet Union lost more than 27 million, Xi said. We must learn the lessons of history and dedicate ourselves to peace The victory of the Chinese People’s War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression was the first complete victory won by China in its resistance against foreign aggression in modern times. This great triumph re-established China as a major country in the world and opened up bright prospects for the great renewal of the Chinese nation, Xi said. He vowed that China would never seek hegemony or expansion no matter how much stronger it might become. He said the country would never inflict its past suffering on any other nation. Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, inspected the troops after the speech.

Seventeen foreign military teams also took part. Leaders including Russian President Vladimir Putin; President of South Korea, Park Geun-hye; President Mamnoon Hussain of Pakistan and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon witnessed the historical event. Overseas Chinese from more than 120 countries and regions were invited, and of the 1779 attending, five were invited to watch the parade from the Tiananmen rostrum, including Chinese American physicist Paul Chu, and business tycoon Lucio Tan. Opening with a helicopter flying the national flag, the march-past lasted for about 50 minutes, during which 20 military helicopters flew overhead forming the figure 70 to mark the 70th anniversary commemorations. Seven fighter jets flew past, making the world’s longest coloured vapour trail. Remember history, cherish the memory of China’s revolutionary martyrs, uphold peace... After more than 300 veterans, including Kuomintang veterans, and their descendants passed by in two vehicle formations, 11 formations of Chinese troops marched past, including 51 female honour guards. It was the first time female honour guards have joined a parade. More than 50 generals, with an average age of 53, leaded parade units. Seventeen formations of foreign troops from 17 countries including Russia and Pakistan, marched past, before 27 formations of armaments were paraded. This was the first time that foreign military teams had joined in a Chinese military parade. More than 500 pieces of China’s latest equipment were displayed, 84 per cent of which had never been viewed by the public and many of which were among the world’s most advanced. The navy displayed its latest anti-ship missiles, ship-to-air missiles and carrier-based aircraft, while the air force brought long-range bombers, fighters and airborne early warning and control (AEWC) aircraft.

The events ended with 10 air force formations flying over the square and doves and balloons being released. China has held 15 military parades since the establishment of the People’s Republic of China. In 1999 and 2009, grand military parades were held to celebrate the country’s 50th and 60th founding anniversaries. This was the first parade not held on China’s National Day. As it is an international convention to hold a parade to mark victory day, China held the grand event with a theme of “remember history, cherish the memory of China’s revolutionary martyrs, uphold peace and create the future”.
