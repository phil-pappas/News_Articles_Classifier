In a key policy address during his first official visit to America , Mr Xi appeared to be attempting to send a conciliatory message on an issue that has become a critical source of tension between the two superpowers. “The Chinese government will not in whatever form engage in commercial theft,” he told an audience of some America’s biggest technology tycoons, in Silicon Valley on Tuesday night. “Hacking against government networks are crimes that must be punished in accordance with the law and relevant international treaties.” Mr Xi said China was ready to establish a “high-level joint dialogue” mechanism with the US to help fight cybercrime.

Cybercrime will be high on the agenda when Mr Xi arrives in Washington today [Thursday]. The Obama administration has publically accused China of using cyber technology to infiltrate American companies and stealing trade secrets and intellectual property. In one of the highest profile cases, Beijing stood accused by American officials of downloading terabytes of data on the Pentagon’s flagship $400 billion F-35 fighter stealth plane program. But it’s not just military targets that have been attacked: “The victims range from oil companies to furniture companies,” said Peter Singer, an expert on cyber warfare issues at the New America think tank. In a briefing ahead of Mr Xi’s arrival, a senior advisor to President Barack Obama described the matter on as a “national security issue” that is “key” to the health of the American economy. “For a state to steal information involving the propriety trade secrets, intellectual property, or other information of a foreign company and then provide it to its own companies for their economic benefit is something that we find unacceptable,” Daniel Kritenbrink, senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council told the Telegraph. The White House has said will use Mr Xi’s visit to foster ever stronger ties in what it sees as the “the most consequential bilateral relationship in the world”. But, on the issue of cybercrime, the administration has said it will not “paper over the differences”. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T04:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T12:49:28.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
