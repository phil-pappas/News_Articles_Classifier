Clare will be honoured for their outstanding civic awareness and contribution for the first time in a special Garda Siochana led competition which now open for nominations. The inaugural Clare Garda Division Youth Awards, the winners of which will be unveiled at a special event at the West County Hotel, Ennis on December 3rd next have been established by the county’s Community Policing Unit to recognise the selfless efforts of six individuals and one group towards others and/or their community.\nEntry forms for the competition are now available and can be accessed on the Garda Siochana . The awards are open to teenagers from ages 14 to 19 from across the county, with a separate award for a group of young people involved in community activity. The closing date for entries is Wednesday, September 30th.\nAnnouncing the awards, Chief Supt of the Clare Garda Division John Kerin said that the awards will honour unsung young heroes in our community who are showing outstanding leadership. “Generally in terms of awards, as a public we tend to be preoccupied with success in the likes of sport or entertainment fields. But there are many, many young people who equally deserve recognition for their efforts to make society a better place for others. “They are the real winners but perhaps heretofore haven’t got recognition they deserve but the inaugural Youth Awards will help address that. We want to encourage as many nominations as possible as we see plenty evidence of incredible civic leadership among young people right across the county.”\nThe organisers say the criteria for what constitutes a nominee is completely open and examples could include a young person helping to look after a parent, grandparent or a neighbour; someone who is overcoming a health issue; perhaps someone who is taking a leadership role in their local youth club.\nShannon Group Chairman Rose Hynes said that the awards will further encourage the many young people with leadership potential. “These awards will thank and recognise outstanding young people not only for the leadership they have undertaken and shown within their communities in Co. Clare but also for their support and contribution to create a more harmonious and sustainable society. Young people want to be engaged as change makers in their lives. They must be part of the solution to create better futures. The winners of these awards may well go on to become the community and civic leaders of tomorrow. We are delighted to sponsor this youth engagement programme which encourages and rewards positive leadership.”\nSource:- Shannon Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T03:24:21.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
