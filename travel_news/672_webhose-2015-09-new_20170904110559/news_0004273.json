Pazsitka was living in student housing at the time in the German city of Braunschweig.\nDetectives elicited help from a popular German crime show called Aktenzeichen XY, and later a suspect in the rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl confessed to killing Pazsitka, according to NBC News.\nPazsitka’s body was never found, and the case was closed in 1989.\nBut things changed two weeks ago when a woman who called herself “Mrs Schneider” summoned police in Dusseldorf, Germany, to report a burglary.\nWhen police arrived and requested ID from the 55-year-old woman to complete the report, she revealed herself to be Pazsitka, and produced an expired identification card to prove she was the missing student, IBTimes reported.\nPazsitka then confessed to cops that she had devised a plan to move into an apartment she had been secretly renting and had saved 20,000 euros ($AU31,000) to create a new life.\nA spokesperson for Braunschweig and Wolfsburg Police reportedly said: “As to the motive of her disappearance, she gave no explanation and expressly said that she continues to want no contact with the public or her family.”\nThis article originally appeared on Fox News.\nOriginally published as ‘Murdered’ student found alive", "external_links": ["http://www.foxnews.com/", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/petra-pazsitka-student-murdered-in-1984-found-alive/story-fnq2oad4-1227546708381"], "published": "2015-09-28T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T02:06:49.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
