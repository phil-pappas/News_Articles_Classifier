New Year's Day, January 1st, precedes the Russian Christmas and is often celebrated as a more important holiday. However, some Russians observe two Christmases and even two New Year's â€“ the first Christmas observed on December 25th, and the second New Year's observed on January 14th. Any public trees, like the Christmas Tree in Moscow's Red Square , will also serve as a symbol of the New Year. Russian Christmas Religious Observances Christmas was not able to be publicly celebrated during much of the 20th century. In addition, many Russians identify themselves as atheists, so religious observance of Christmas has faded out of fashion. However, more and more Russians are returning to religion (Russian Orthodoxy), and therefore the number of people celebrating Christmas as a religious holiday continues to grow.\nSome Orthodox Christian Christmas traditions mimic those traditions in other parts of Eastern Europe. For example, a white tablecloth and hay remind Christmas Eve diners of Christ's manger. A meatless meal may be prepared for Christmas Eve, which is eaten only after the appearance of the first star in the sky. \nA Christmas church service, which happens the night of Christmas Eve, is attended by members of the Orthodox church. Even the President of Russia has begun attending these solemn, beuatiful services in Moscow. The Russian Santa Claus \nThe Russian Santa Claus is named Ded Moroz , or Father Frost. Accompanied by Snegurochka , the Snow Maiden, he brings presents to children to place under the New Year's tree. He carries a staff, wears valenki and is carried across Russia in a troika . Svyatki - Russian Christmastide \nSvyatki, Russian Christmastide follows the celebration of Christmas and lasts until January 19, the day Epiphany is celebrated. This two-week period is closely associated with pagan traditions of fortune telling and caroling.
