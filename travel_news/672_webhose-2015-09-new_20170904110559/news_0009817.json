(\"Volkswagen\") alleging that Volkswagen covertly and intentionally misrepresented to consumers that its \"Clean Diesel\" vehicles satisfied EPA air pollution standards when, in fact, the vehicles did not and were rigged to show that they did.\nAccording to the EPA, Volkswagen knew its vehicles failed to meet EPA pollution standards and actively concealed this information from consumers and regulators. Volkswagen installed sophisticated software that activated pollution controls only when vehicles were being tested for emissions compliance. However, during routine driving, the \"Clean Diesel\" vehicles emit up to 40 times more pollution than legally permitted, and the affected vehicles are unfit to be registered in the United States. The pertinent vehicles now include:\nVolkswagen Jetta (Model Years 2009 – 2015) Volkswagen Beetle (Model Years 2009 – 2015) Volkswagen Golf (Model Years 2009 – 2015) Volkswagen Passat (Model Years 2014-2015) Audi A3 (Model Years 2009 – 2015) Finkelstein & Krinsk has been successfully bringing consumer class actions for over 30 years, and represents corporate, union and individual clients throughout the United States. To ensure that you are eligible to recover in any successful action, you may seek to become a plaintiff in the case. Doing so can enhance the likelihood that other consumers from your state will also be able to participate in any recovery and damages.
