But the first sip was much lighter and fruitier than I had expected. Instead of whiskey, the bartender had used Zufanek Hruskovica, a type of pear brandy that had been aged in oak barrels, as well as house-made chocolate bitters. The taste was as acidic and sweet as the classic, but still noticeably different, making it both internationally recognizable and location-specific.\nBut what location was that, exactly?\nI sat back in my wooden booth and looked around. Above, the dim lights of the bar glimmered against the molded tin ceiling. It was an homage, the bartender explained, to his favorite bar in New York, the original location of the legendary Milk and Honey, now known as Attaboy.\n“Eldridge Street, Number 134, in Chinatown,” he said, making a face of happy reminiscence, tinged with a touch of reverence. “I would call it a chapel.”\nMost of us would probably just call it a cocktail bar, but most of us are not so serious about mixed drinks — and especially about seeking them out in the Czech capital, Prague .\nPhoto Public Interest in Prague. The city’s cocktail scene has changed enormously; classics and new concoctions can readily be found. Credit Milan Bures for The New York Times The Czech Republic is rightly thought of as a country of beer lovers, who consume the highest annual amount of beer per capita. But a surprisingly large number of expat Czechs have recently found fame in the international cocktail industry, especially in London: Artesian, regularly ranked as the best bar in the world in numerous competitions, is run by the Czech-born Alex Kratena, while Pavel (Paul) Tvaroh created the celebrated Lounge Bohemia, a Czech-themed cocktail bar in Shoreditch.\nElsewhere, bartenders like George Nemec and Zdenek Kastanek have brought a Czech touch to China, Australia — where Mr. Nemec was named bartender of the year in 2004 — and Singapore, where Mr. Kastanek’s work at 28 Hong Kong Street helped earn the best international bar team award at this year’s Tales of the Cocktail . Other local barkeeps have worked in New York and elsewhere in the United States before heading back to Prague.\n“Compared to a few years ago, it’s much healthier, it’s more original, it’s adventurous, and it’s competitive with the rest of the world,” said Mr. Nemec, when asked about the changes in Prague’s cocktail scene. “Now it makes me proud, basically, with what I can offer in this city when I have foreign guests.”\nThe difference is remarkable. As recently as six years ago, there were only about four or five bars in Prague where you could order a drink as common as an old-fashioned. Today, you can sample relatively obscure classics like the scofflaw, the daisy or the Martinez at more than a dozen bars. In addition, bartenders are making unique variations using local spirits and ingredients, often including the Czech herbal liqueur Becherovka, or the high-grade spirits from the cult Czech distiller Zufanek, all mixed and served at international standards.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story That’s not to say that Prague’s cocktail scene is not without a few quirks of its own, as I discovered when I toured the city’s best bars, both old and new, this summer.\nTo start, it is most definitely not the kind of town where people stop for a restorative on the way home from work. Many of Prague’s cocktail bars don’t open until 6 or 7 p.m., and spots like the wonderful, two-year-old Bonvivant’s CTC — where I had my Zufanek Hruskovica sour — usually don’t get busy until around midnight. For many bars, reservations are a necessity.\nMost of the places where you can order the relatively new Penicillin — a Scotch-based cocktail made with ginger, lemon and honey — without a second glance are in Prague’s Old Town, where a branch of New York’s Bar & Books opened in 2004, joining earlier high-end watering holes Bugsy’s and Tretter’s. But plenty of decent cocktails can now be found in outlying neighborhoods. Bar & Books opened its second Prague branch in the trendy Vinohrady neighborhood in 2008, which also saw the arrival of the new Gin and Tonic Club — home to 55 kinds of gin and 11 tonics, as well as house specialties — earlier this year.\nEven grittier neighborhoods now have great cocktails. In street-smart Zizkov, the lowbrow Malkovich bar serves local classics like the Almond Cigar, an amaretto and rum concoction invented by the Bugsy’s bartender Vaclav Vojir for an international competition, where it took second place.\nAnd in the relatively remote zone between the Liben and Vysocany neighborhoods (though just a few minutes from the Ceskomoravska metro station), the speakeasy-style Innuendo Prohibition Bar serves unusual creations, often made with local ingredients. Innuendo’s Elderflower Nail trades a rusty nail’s Drambuie for a fragrant elderflower syrup, a typical homemade ingredient in Central Europe, combining it with a local honey liqueur and 12-year-old blended Scotch into a refreshing but unusual elixir.\nApart from the arrivals in the outskirts, at least nine of the city’s best bars are concentrated in a very small area in the center of the city; online maps calculate a walk from one end to the other at 16 minutes, though it might require a bit more time if you stop to enjoy the architecture. This part of Old Town is one of the city’s most attractive, home to some of its most expensive real estate.\nThis brings up another unique feature of Prague’s cocktail bars: Despite the use of the same bourbon, scotch, gin and mixers in bars anywhere else in the world, the drinks in Prague are often quite affordable. At Bugsy’s, just steps from the city’s Hermès and Cartier boutiques, a spot-on Singapore sling costs 165 koruna, or about $7 at 23 koruna to the dollar. At the moody Black Angels, right on touristy Old Town Square, a Corpse Reviver No. 2 costs 135 koruna, less than half of what you might pay in a trendy bar in New York or London.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story The growing popularity of cocktails has also spread to restaurants. The year-old restaurant Agave has a great cocktail list, mostly based on tequila and mezcal, to pair with its cleverly updated Mexican cuisine. If you’ve never had tamales and habanero sauce with an old-fashioned made with 23-year-old Zacapa rum, you’re missing out.\n“They just go together, beef and bourbon, don’t they?” asked Juraj Filo, the general manager of George Prime Steaks, an upscale steakhouse with a solid cocktail list that is mostly bourbon-based. He estimated that 50 percent of his restaurant’s guests ordered cocktails before dinner, and about 10 percent stuck with cocktails through their meals, instead of wine; many also had a chocolate martini or another cocktail instead of dessert. “It’s part of the North American steakhouse culture.”\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story That’s true, which is probably why it still feels rare in Central Europe. Despite the new arrivals, Prague now has just one bar on the World’s 50 Best Bars list — the excellent Hemingway Bar, currently ranked No. 24 — but that’s one more than Vienna, the next capital over. (Berlin, a city three times as large as Prague, also has one bar on the list.) That means that many of the best cocktail bars here are fairly serious about what they do: not quite as serious as something out of D.J. Dave’s “Mixologist” video, but close.\nDuring my nights out in Prague, a friend was denied entry by the doorman at Tretter’s, apparently because he was wearing sandals, even though the temperature at the time was over 90 degrees. The presentation at many Prague bars can be fairly (self-) serious, as well, in both good and bad ways.\nAt Hemingway, the house barrel-aged rum old-fashioned is served in a flask that arrives inside a hollowed-out book of Hemingway’s short stories, while the Hemingway’s Paparazzi (Havana Club rum, Becherovka, apricot brandy, sugar, apricot and chocolate tea, fresh lime and fresh mint) is served inside a high-speed Canon camera lens. At the six-month-old L’Fleur, a deliberately singed antiquarian book by the Czech poet Rudolf Tesnohlidek serves as a tray for the Decadente, an Armagnac-based take on the Sazerac. The good side of such presentation is that it’s fun and intellectually stimulating. But if you just stopped in for a quick one, you might find it to be a bit much.\nOne exception: the new Cash Only, a sister bar to Hemingway, though in this case a much younger sister, one who has entirely different tastes. Where Hemingway is serious and cool, playing jazz and lounge tunes, Cash Only is footloose and fun, offering up 95-koruna hot dogs as bar snacks and playing contemporary emo and rock tracks that just might make you feel old. In some ways, it feels less like a cocktail bar and more like a long, narrow dance club.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story I thought the drinks, however, were every bit as good as those elsewhere, and just as inventive: The house special on my visit, called a Popcorn Sour, was based on a rum that the bartenders had infused with hot buttered popcorn, shaken with lemon juice and simple syrup, then strained and served with a topping of fresh popcorn. Of all the photos I shared with my friends on Facebook, this one earned the most interest.\nDespite the growth in the bar scene, there’s more to come. Prague recently saw the opening of an unlisted, pop-up version of London’s Lounge Bohemia, while a new branch of Bar & Books is opening in the Polish capital, Warsaw.\nPhoto A whiskey sour at Black Angels bar. Credit Milan Bures for The New York Times It’s enough to make you think that Prague is a center for cocktail culture in the Old World. But local connoisseurs will take issue with that claim, with rumors swirling around the surprising new bar scene in Brno, the Czech Republic’s second-largest city, about three hours to the southeast. According to scuttlebutt, a brand-new Brno bar called Super Panda Circus has the very best cocktail list in the country.\nAt least for now.\nIF YOU GO Where to Drink Bugsy’s, Parizska 10 (enter on Kostecna Street); bugsysbar.cz .\nTretter’s, V Kolkovne 3; tretters.cz .\nBar & Books, Tynska 19 and Manesova 64; barandbooks.cz .\nHemingway Bar, Karoliny Svetle 26; hemingwaybar.cz .\nBonvivant’s CTC, Bartolomejska 3; facebook.com/BONVIVANTsCTC .\nAnonymous Bar, Michalska 12; anonymousbar.cz .\nPublic Interest, U Milosrdnych 12; publicinterest.cz .\nParlour, Krakovska 15; parlour.cz .\nCash Only, Liliova 3; cashonlybar.cz .\nBlack Angels, Staromestske Namesti 29; blackangelsbar.cz .\nInnuendo Prohibition Bar, Kurta Konrada 20; prohibitionbar.cz .\nL’Fleur, V Kolkovne 5; lfleur.cz .\nGin and Tonic Club, Vinohradska 45; gintonicclub.com .\nMalkovich Bar, Borivojova 100; facebook.com/malkovichbar .\nWhere to Eat George Prime Steak, Platnerska 19; georgeprimesteak.com .
