If you’re staying in around the southern city of Miami you’ll have no problem finding thrilling ways to stretch those few days to the max. Those who book flights to Florida can fly into Orlando Sanford Airport . \nTravel light, pack your sunscreen and sunglasses, and prepare to take your place with the 85 million people who take flights to the sunshine state every year. \nTake in the sun \nIf you’re the sort of person who wants to spend as much time as possible on the beach then you’ve come to the right place. The city itself may be where vacationers and locals meet for the culture and cuisine, but it’s the beaches that are the social hub and part of everyday life. Names such as South Beach, Sunny Isles and Biscayne Bay should be familiar, and they’re synonymous with white sands, luxurious waterfront hotels and of course the ‘beautiful people’. If you can’t make up your mind which beach to spend the day on then simply head three miles east to Miami Beach where you’ll find a young, vibrant crowd of international travellers all intent on having the best time possible. \nNight and the city \nMiami is Florida’s nightlife capital and it’s a heady mix of late night cocktail bars, Latin-themed lounges and ultra-hip nightclubs. If you’re looking for something chic and sophisticated then try the Living Room in South Beach or step back in time to Cuba in the 1940s at The Rum Line terrace bar in Miami Beach. You’ll easily find a neighbourhood in this city that caters to your individual nightlife taste whether that’s live music bars down at the Coconut Grove waterfront area or the world-class DJs playing at the club scene in South Beach. And when it comes to restaurants, you’re in a multi-cultural city where you can dine on some of the best Cuban, Chinese, French, Italian and of course seafood cuisine, day or night. \nPack in some sightseeing \nLooking for some photo opportunity moments? This city is packed with them. Don’t miss the colorful and astonishing-looking art deco buildings on Ocean Drive, which look even more glamorous when illuminated at night. The Bayside Marketplace is a beautiful waterfront area with plenty of cafes, restaurants and tourists shops, and you can catch a water-taxi from there straight to Miami Beach and Biscayne Bay. If you really want to explore then take a boat trip to the island of Key West to enjoy the beautiful beaches, historic waterfront area, and of course those spectacular sunsets. \nFlorida is one of America’s most popular locations and there’s a lot to see and do outside of Miami in locations such as the theme park capital of Orlando. However, for a girl’s weekend getaway it doesn’t come much better than Miami, which may be why it’s been nicknamed ‘the magic city’.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T02:50:33.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
