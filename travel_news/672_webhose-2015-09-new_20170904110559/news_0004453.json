The group must travel with tour operators registered with the Tourism and Culture Ministry, and members of the group will be given a temporary social pass limited to 15 days for each entry into Malaysia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T20:28:45.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
