All other airports continued to operate as usual,\" he said. \nBoth the Kuala Lumpur International Airport and KLIA2 remained open to air traffic. \nIn a statement, Malindo Air said all its affected passengers had been notified and that they could either change their flight dates for free or opt for full refunds. \nMalindo Air chief executive Chandran Rama Muthy said flights which were supposed to land at Subang during the closure were diverted to Penang and Johor Baru. \nHe said one flight from Trichy, India, which was scheduled to land at KLIA2 in Sepang, was initially diverted to Penang due to the haze but was later allowed to land in KLIA2 when visibility improved. \nFirely chief executive Ignatius Ong said all of the airline's flights in and out of the airport were affected during the closure and urged passengers to contact the airline. \nIn a statement, Malaysia Airlines said its operations at KLIA were largely unaffected by the haze yesterday. \nIt said only one of its planes, Flight MH2591 from Miri to Kuala Lumpur, was diverted to Penang due to poor visibility. \n\"Aside from Flight MH2591, all other Malaysia Airlines flights in and out of KLIA were not affected by the haze,\" it said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T02:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T04:37:37.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
