They swat the in-flight croissant flakes from their trousers and move en masse to the car rental, where they will jump in convertibles in a swell of joie de vivre.\nThe weather is so preternaturally good in Provence that locals and visitors alike conspire to live outside. Easing your car onto the road—top down, of course—you’ll pass swarms of cyclists, their no-nonsense Lycra an odd contrast to the rustic countryside, pumping up hills and gliding through valleys. There are kayaks in the rivers, hot-air balloons in the heavens, and bon vivants in the vineyards, strolling with glasses in hand. But the most rewarding hours in the open air will be spent at the dining table, spearing rabbit and prunes with the countryside swept out before you. Provence is sensibly rich in garden bistros and hillside dining. Here are a few favorites:\nLe Jardin du Quai , L’Isle-sur-la-Sorgue\nL’Isle-sur-la-Sorgue is a quiet riverside town known primarily for its Sunday antiques market. Near to the railway station is Le Jardin du Quai, a garden restaurant hidden from sight until you step through the wrought-iron doorway. Once inside, lush greenery surrounds elegant outdoor tables, shaded by trees and vines, where the restaurant Labrador, Scooby, is sniffing the patrons with interest. Waiters carry the single copy of the day’s no-choice menu around on a chalkboard, easing themselves between potted plants and garden sculptures. You’ll order a bottle of wine before tucking into a few pre-luncheon bites placed on the table: fresh radishes with butter, or olive tapenade smeared over chewy French bread. The kitchen, run by chef Daniel Hebet , delivers three comforting courses for a set price. Spare ribs cooked in honey are tremulously tender, and an apricot and pistachio tart is gratifying and not overly sweet. The meal should take a few hours and as many bottles of Gigondas, concluding with strong espresso and a lick on the hand from Scooby.\nLa Petite Maison de Cucuron , Cucuron\nThe approach to the medieval village of Cucuron is on a winding road through the verdant and mountainous Luberon region. This is prime Provençal sightseeing, and it would be wise to build in time for gaping. La Petite Maison is run out of an inviting yellow house with blue shutters located in the center of town. In the warmer months, guests are seated on the ivy-covered terrace, and there is a choice of two menus—€50 for three courses or €70 for five—and an excellent, mostly local wine list. The food is luxurious and approachable; the restaurant holds a Michelin star, but the distinction is worn lightly. A bowl of buttery chanterelles is served in parsley sauce with a gently poached egg, topped with a small mountain of summer truffle shavings. An aged piece of beef, seared and ruby rare, comes with artichokes and olive oil. These are simple dishes, executed well with ingredients at their peak. Chef Eric Sapet is a warm host, and if you linger long enough, he might join you for coffee and a chat about the goings-on in the village.\nLe Mas Tourteron , Gordes\nBefore setting out for this wonderful restaurant, located a few miles past the hilltop town center of Gordes (one of the most-photographed communities in Provence, with good reason), prepare yourself for the final stretch of the journey, when you will rumble down a country road and feel certain you missed a turn. Drive two minutes past the point at which you are sure you’re lost and there you’ll find the arched entrance to Le Mas Tourteron. The halcyon garden, stretched out in front of an 18th-century farmhouse obscured by vines, is all dappled light and white linen. There are spare sun hats hanging from a mulberry tree and fellow patrons dressed in graceful French country neutrals. Elisabeth Bourgeois has been the chef-owner of Le Mas Tourteron since the late ’80s and maintains a formidable reputation throughout France. When she walks out of the kitchen to check on the guests, who are murmuring over zucchini flowers stuffed with guinea fowl, and braised lamb with Moroccan spices, her sleek dachshund, Ferdinand, is at her heels. Elisabeth’s husband, Philippe , manages the wine list and guides diners to bottles of local Grenache and loftier vintages of Bordeaux. The intimacy and setting make for a meal of rare loveliness.\nLe Bistro du Paradou, Paradou\nIt is cheating, slightly, to include Le Bistro du Paradou on this open-air list, because meals generally only begin and end on the sunny roadside terrace. The middle three courses are served in a homey restaurant with chic tile floors and long wooden tables. But it is too good to miss. When you arrive, you will be seated outside with a dish of green olives and asked if you would like a glass of something. Pastis is the choice of the crowd, though if you decide to move directly to wine—it is included in the €49 set price—a bottomless bottle of the house red or white will appear. At some point, you’ll wander inside for a plate of ratatouille and then possibly roasted rabbit pierced with rosemary sprigs or Bresse chicken with homemade fettuccine and morels. There is no choice to the menu, so phone ahead to hear the week’s offerings before making a reservation. In preparation for the magnificent cheese course, you’ll find your bread basket refreshed and your wineglass topped up. A wide basket of local cheeses, jams, and golden raisins soaked in Cognac (give these particular attention) will remain on the table until someone else calls for it. When you have had your fill, it is the moment to return to the terrace for dessert (order whichever homemade tart is on offer) and espresso, and perhaps another glass of Pastis to bookend the visit. This is the quintessential, unhurried Provençal meal; sadly, it will spoil you for most other restaurants.\nWhere to stay\nProvence boasts many hotels with superb dining. One of the best is Hotel Crillon le Brave , perched atop a steep hill and home to Restaurant Jérôme Blanchet. Weather permitting, dinner is served on a spectacular terrace with far-reaching views of the French countryside. The service is notably warm, and dishes are refined but sumptuous—foie gras with black figs and lavender honey; scorpion fish over chanterelles and apricots. The bedrooms are serene and luxurious; quite a few are blessed with the same view of the countryside that the restaurant affords, and it is worth asking for one of these when booking. There is also a small but lovely spa and, crucially, a very good club sandwich on the room-service menu—for those evenings when you find yourself returning from lunch at 9 p.m.\nAlso of note is the Alain Ducasse outpost Hostellerie de l’Abbaye de la Celle , a characterful house adjoining a former Benedictine monastery. The main draw here is the Michelin-starred food, and it is worth the trip. Guests are seated in comfortable chairs on a wide, charming patio with views of a manicured courtyard. The menus are long and sybaritic—and unusually for such a long meal, each course feels essential. A risotto with porcini mushrooms and ham elicits appreciative sighs from every table upon delivery, and local beef is wonderfully elevated with beetroot and black olives. The kitchen maintains a large garden, open to visitors, where much of the restaurant’s produce is grown, and the dedication to quality is evident. By the time you have finished with cheese and dessert and are nursing a second glass of Armagnac, your eyelids will be heavy. Thoughtfully, upon arriving back at your room, you will find the most comfortable white nightshirt folded at the foot of the bed—why more hotels don’t think to do this I can’t imagine. Slip it gratefully over your head, climb under the covers, and dream of breakfast.", "external_links": ["http://www.crillonlebrave.com/", "http://www.abbaye-celle.com/en", "http://www.lapetitemaisondecucuron.com/", "http://www.jardin-du-quai.com/", "http://www.mastourteron.com/uk/index.php"], "published": "2015-09-22T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T22:29:37.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
