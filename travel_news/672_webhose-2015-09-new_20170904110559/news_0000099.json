At the time, the five-story, 50-room Islander Hotel on Seaside Avenue was the first new hotel to be built in Waikiki since the construction of the Royal Hawaiian hotel 20 years earlier. \nFrom the beginning, Roy and Estelle’s vision was to “share the spirit of aloha” with every guest. Today, that vision has blossomed into a global portfolio of 40 properties in the most iconic tropical destinations throughout Hawaii, Asia-Pacific and the Indian Ocean. On Sept. 29, Outrigger Resorts guests will be invited to raise a glass to Roy and Estelle’s legacy of Aloha at Manager’s Receptions being held at each resort, pick up a limited edition vintage T-shirt, enjoy special discounted room rates, participate in a fun social media contest, and more. “When my grandparents founded the company back in 1947, they instilled several core values like providing guests with distinctive hospitality and value, and treating every employee like ohana, or family. I know they would be proud to know that these values are still at the heart of everything we do,” said Bitsy Kelley, vice president of corporate communications at Outrigger Enterprises Group. “In honor of Roy and Estelle, we invite all guests of Outrigger Resorts to take part in the host of activities we have in store.” Special room rates What would a Founders Day celebration be without some special savings? Founders Day rates will be available online starting Sept. 29 for stays booked between Sept. 29 and Oct. 27, 2015. Visitors are invited to visit outrigger.com beginning Sept. 29 to take advantage of the special savings. The company will also show its appreciation to travel agents and invites them to experience Outrigger Resorts’ signature hospitality with highly discounted room rates for reservations booked between now and Oct. 31, 2015, for stays through Nov. 30, 2015.

Outrigger is also offering double rewards points for travel agents who sign up to become Outrigger Expert Agents now through Oct. 12, 2015.
