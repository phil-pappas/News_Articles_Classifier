The online community portals act a platform of information and connectivity for the members who belong to same community and share many things in common mostly the native place which imply the basic culture of a human being. A good online community portal like an Indian community portal in Atlanta will have following things:1. Sense of history and cultureAn online community portal should have and provide a sense of history and culture within the members to let the community blossom. The feeling of belonging should continuously grow. It is important for the spirit for which the portal was created. The technology platform and security measures of the website should help to protect the members and their connection and feelings from any kind of outside invasion. 2. Correct informationOnline portals are mainly known for helpful information and this is where an online community portal cannot afford to go wrong like if an Indian is looking for best Indian food in Atlanta via an online Indian community portal in Atlanta, he should get the correct information and location.3. Defined goalsAny online community portal should have a common goal or set of objectives, it is like the soul without which the portal is likely to falter. People will become disenchanted and move on to another more organized venue. It will be easier to communicate if people are on the same page at the same time and it is for this reason that it makes sense to have different areas in the portal for different activities like one area should be set-up specifically for interaction among the members and another section could have products and services that are directly relevant to the members. Some other sections could include things like news features, and events. Successful online community portals should have the look and feel of the \"real-world.\" 4. Defined terms and conditionsThe terms and conditions for interacting should be drawn up to avoid chaos and hassles. These rules should often deal with the behaviors of individuals mainly to keep people civil and the power in hands of the site to control any inappropriate activity.5.
