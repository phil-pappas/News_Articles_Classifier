See a map \nGeologists divide the San Andreas Fault into three parts and there are plenty of places to see in each one: \nSouthern San Andreas Fault \nThe San Andreas Fault begins near the Salton Sea, runs north along the San Bernardino Mountains, crosses Cajon Pass and then along the San Gabriel Mountains east of Los Angeles. The mud pots near the Salton Sea are a result of its action, but around Palm Springs is the best place to get a look at the The San Andreas Fault in this area . \nContinuing north, the San Andreas Fault crosses I-5 near Frazier Park and bends toward the north. Running between I-5 and US Hwy 101, it passes through the Carrizo Plain, one of the best places in the state to see the San Andreas Fault where its accompanying geological features are plainly visible - also a great place for bird-watching and spring wildflowers. The classic San Andreas Fault view shown above was taken over it. If you're flying north-south above California, you can sometimes see this view and it's worth getting a window seat (not above the wing) and having your camera handy, just in case. \nCentral San Andreas Fault \nA bend in the San Andreas Fault north of Frazier Park creates an earthquake about every 150 years. In Parkfield, you can see the results in a bent bridge . Parkfield is fun to visit, home to a deep well dug to explore the San Andreas Fault's behavior, but speaking of its title as Earthquake Capitol with tongue in cheek.
