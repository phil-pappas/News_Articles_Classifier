Address : Science and Technology Museum Metro Stop (Metro Line 2), Pudong Opening hours : Daily. 10am-6pm. Comments : What happened to Xiang Yang market? After that famous \"fake\" market closed its gates in 2006, many vendors relocated to Yatai Xinyang. This is a great place to buy inexpensive souvenirs: Shanghai t-shirts, chopsticks, cushion covers and pashminas. Let the buyer beware: when it comes to fakes, you get what you pay for (and you probably paid too much). 13. Shanghai Longhua Fashion and Gift Market Description : Outdoor market full of stalls selling the same thing as #4 above. Address : 2465 Longhua Road, near the Longhua Temple Opening hours : Daily. 10am-6pm. Comments : According to its local ads, the original Xiang Yang market is \"now registered as Longhua Market\". Well, indeed, after Xiang Yang, the famous \"fake\" market, closed its gates in 2006, many vendors relocated to Yatai Xinyang above and to the Longhua market. It sells the same items as #4, has the added value of being near the temple, so you could do a bit of sight-seeing before you shop. Description : Three floors of fabric and tailors. Address : 399 Lujiabang Road (near the Bund) Opening hours : Daily. 10am-7pm. Comments : Here you can make your couture dreams come true. Great values are qipaos, cashmere coats and men's shirts. Almost every stall has its own tailor who can whip up whatever you want in about a week. Your best bet is to have something you like copied over in your new fabric. Clothing made from photos or descriptions yield mixed (mostly bad) results. If you can, bring a Chinese speaker with you. Some tailors do speak English.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T01:14:30.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
