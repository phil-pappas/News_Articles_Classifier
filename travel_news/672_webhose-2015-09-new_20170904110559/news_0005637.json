We feel that the Fiji International fits our brand positioning and reaches our target market. With the live broadcast of the event to over 300 million households globally, we see the value in being associated to such an important event which puts Fiji’s golf tourism on the world stage.”\nMr. Nabalarua added, “FIJI Water was founded in 1996 out of the desire to share the earth’s finest water with the world. Today, it is available in leading hotels, fine restaurants, retail locations, as well as by direct delivery. FIJI Water is now the number one imported bottled water in the United States and is enjoyed in over 60 countries across the globe.”\nMatt Porm who heads up the Commercial Department for the Fiji International emphasized the importance of true Fijian brands supporting the Fiji International, “It is always great to see local brands step up to the plate to support such an important event for the nation. The Fiji International offers a variety of platforms for our sponsors to activate their partnerships with us.\nWe are very happy to have FIJI Water back on board as a leading brand of the country and could not ask for a better quality water to be served to our players, guests and volunteers of the event this year. The family of sponsors of the Fiji International is shaping up nicely and we welcome any other local brands to join the effort to establishing Fiji as a must visit golf destination of the world.”\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:05:25.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
