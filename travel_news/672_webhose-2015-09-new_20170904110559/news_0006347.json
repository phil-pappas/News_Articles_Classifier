On this additional capacity, system wide traffic for August increased 10.1 per cent. Air Canada reports traffic results on a system-wide basis, including regional airlines from which Air Canada purchases capacity and Air Canada rouge ® .\n“I am extremely pleased to report strong traffic growth of 10.1 per cent for the month of August, a month during which we served 4.2 million customers, more than any month in Air Canada’s 78-year history,” said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Air Canada generated greater traffic in all markets resulting in a load factor of 89.6 per cent in line with last year’s all-time record. These strong results demonstrate the effectiveness of our commercial strategy focusing on international growth. The impact of the economic slowdown in Western Canada is more than offset by strong demand in U.S. and overseas markets resulting in a 9.9 per cent traffic growth year-to-date compared to last year. I would like to thank our customers for choosing Air Canada as their preferred carrier and our employees for taking care of them and transporting them safely to their destination.”\nAugust\nYear to Date\n2015\n2014\nChange\n2015\n2014\nChange\nTraffic (RPMs mln)\n7,315\n6,645\n+10.1%\n46,140\n41,980\n+9.9%\nCapacity (ASMs mln)\n8,165\n7,398\n+10.4%\n54,702\n49,939\n+9.5%\nLoad Factor\n89.6%\n89.8%\n-0.2 pts\n84.3%\n84.1%\n+0.2 pts\nCanada\nRPMs\n2,057\n1,964\n+4.7%\n12,307\n11,884\n+3.6%\nASMs\n2,346\n2,210\n+6.2%\n14,711\n14,264\n+3.1%\nLF\n87.7%\n88.8%\n-1.1 pts\n83.7%\n83.3%\n+0.4 pts\nUS\nTransborder\nRPMs\n1,074\n928\n+15.7%\n8,129\n7,043\n+15.4%\nASMs\n1,234\n1,072\n+15.1%\n9,716\n8,466\n+14.8%\nLF\n87.1%\n86.6%\n+0.5 pts\n83.7%\n83.2%\n+0.5 pts\nAtlantic\nRPMs\n2,386\n2,145\n+11.2%\n12,500\n11,059\n+13.0%\nASMs\n2,626\n2,361\n+11.2%\n14,949\n13,440\n+11.2%\nLF\n90.9%\n90.9%\n0 pts\n83.6%\n82.3%\n+1.3 pts\nPacific\nRPMs\n1,347\n1,206\n+11.7%\n9,105\n8,323\n+9.4%\nASMs\n1,454\n1,310\n+11.0%\n10,527\n9,483\n+11.0%\nLF\n92.7%\n92.1%\n+0.6 pts\n86.5%\n87.8%\n-1.3 pts\nLatin America & Caribbean\nRPMs\n451\n402\n+12.2%\n4,099\n3,671\n+11.7%\nASMs\n505\n445\n+13.5%\n4,799\n4,286\n+12.0%\nLF\n89.2%\n90.3%\n-1.1 pts\n85.4%\n85.6%\n-0.2 pts\nAir Canada is Canada’s largest domestic and international airline serving more than 190 destinations on five continents.
