(OTC: NEWL) (\"NewLead\" or the \"Company\") announced today a review of the commercial performance of one of its bitumen tanker vessels, the MT Nepheli (\"Nepheli\") since the vessel was delivered to NewLead's fleet.\nThe Nepheli is a 2009-built bitumen tanker vessel of 3,416 dwt and is one of the five bitumen tanker vessels that were delivered to NewLead's fleet in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nWhen NewLead took delivery of the Nepheli in November 2014 , the vessel was already chartered-out on a time charter agreement for one year at a net rate of US $6,700 per day. The time charter contract was concluded at the end of July 2015 and from delivery of the vessel to NewLead until such time, 82,473.76 tons of asphalt were transported. Following the conclusion in July 2015 , NewLead entered into a new time charter contract, in direct continuation of the prior contract, for a one year period at a gross rate of US $7,400 per day less 3.75% commission payable to third parties. The Nepheli will be principally trading in the Middle East area.\nUpon delivery of the Nepheli to NewLead in November 2014 , the Company invested in the maintenance, improvement and upgrade of the vessel's condition. The vessel's improved technical condition allowed for an increase of approximately 5% in the vessel's cargo in-take capacity and a decrease in the fuel consumption for steaming and cargo heating, as well as an improvement of the speed and consumption of the vessel.\nMr. Michael Zolotas , Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NewLead, stated, \"NewLead's investment in the improvement of the condition of the Nepheli enhanced the commercial performance and tradability of the vessel. Together with the oil major vettings, the Nepheli has been attracting reputable charterers' attention. Our decision to invest in the technical improvement of the vessel upon her delivery to NewLead is expected to enhance the cash flow of NewLead.\"\nMr. Zolotas added, \"The enhanced performance of the Nepheli in the time charter contract upon the delivery of the vessel to NewLead resulted in the renewal of the charter party agreement with improved terms. We will continue to capitalize on the commercial and technical expertise of NewLead which are fundamental in the bitumen market while aiming to expand the Company's fleet with modern bitumen vessels. \"\nNewLead has approximately 50% and 74.75% of its operating days covered for 2015 and 20% and 16.27% of its operating days covered for 2016 for its dry bulk and tanker vessels, respectively.\nFleet Update\nThe following table details NewLead's fleet as of August 31, 2015 :\nVessel Name\nSize (dwts)\nVessel Type\nYear Built\nCharter Expiration Date\nDry Bulk Carriers\nNewlead Castellano\n35,542\nEco-type Handysize\n2013\nQ4 2015\nNewlead Albion\n32,318\nEco-type Handysize\n2012\nQ3 2015\nNewlead Venetico\n32,394\nEco-type Handysize\n2012\nQ3 2015\nNewlead Victoria\n75,966\nPanamax\n2002\nmin Q2 - max Q3 2018\nNewlead Markela\n71,733\nPanamax\n1990\nQ2 2016\nTanker Vessels\nNewlead Granadino\n5,887\nAsphalt/Bitumen Oil Tanker\n2009\nmin Q1 2016 - max Q3 2017\nKaterina L\n3,357\nAsphalt/Bitumen Oil Tanker\n2009\nQ4 2015\nNepheli\n3,416\nAsphalt/Bitumen Oil Tanker\n2009\nQ3 2016\nIoli\n3,396\nAsphalt/Bitumen Oil Tanker\n2009\nmin Q1 2016 - max Q1 2020\nSofia\n2,888\nAsphalt/Bitumen Oil Tanker\n2008\nSpot\nGema 1\n19,831\nOil Tanker\n2001\nSpot\n1.

These statements, as well as words such as \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"project,\" \"plan,\" and \"expect,\" are intended to be ''forward-looking\" statements. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions and beliefs about future events may vary from actual results and the differences can be material. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, such matters as the creditworthiness of our counterparties, the reliability of reserve reports, our ability to extract or acquire coal to fulfill contracts, the consummation of conditional contracts, future operating or financial results; our liquidity position and cash flows, our ability to borrow additional amounts under our revolving credit facility and, if needed, to obtain waivers from our lenders and restructure our debt, and our ability to continue as a going concern; statements about planned, pending or recent vessel disposals and/or acquisitions, business strategy, future dividend payments and expected capital spending or operating expenses, including dry-docking and insurance costs; statements about trends in the product tanker and dry bulk vessel shipping segments, including charter rates and factors affecting supply and demand; expectations regarding the availability of vessel acquisitions; completion of repairs; length of off-hire; availability of charters; and anticipated developments with respect to any pending litigation. The forward-looking statements in this press release are based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including without limitation, management's examination of historical operating trends, data contained in our records and other data available from third parties. Although NewLead believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond our control, NewLead cannot assure you that it will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or projections described in the forward looking statements. Important factors that, in our view, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include the strength of world economies and currencies, general market conditions, including changes in charter rates and vessel values, failure of a seller to deliver one or more vessels, and other factors discussed in NewLead's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. NewLead expressly disclaims any obligations or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in NewLead's expectations with respect thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any statement is based.\nInvestor and Media Relations:\nElisa Gerouki\nNewLead Holdings Ltd.\nTelephone: + 30 213 014 8023\nEmail: egerouki@newleadholdings.com\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150303/179145LOGO\n releases/newlead-holdings-announces-commercial-performance-of-mt-nepheli-300135830.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/newlead-holdings-announces-commercial-performance-of-mt-nepheli-300135830.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150303/179145LOGO", "http://www.newleadholdings.com/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY91093&Transmission_Id=201509010830PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY91093&DateId=20150901", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150303/179145LOGO"], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T17:55:05.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
