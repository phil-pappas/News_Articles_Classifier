The traffic information is displayed on the smartphone screen, via an application that switches seamlessly between DAB and the Internet, to ensure the best service delivery at all times.\nUsers benefit from reduced mobile data communication costs and avoid roaming fees when traveling abroad. Moreover, they receive traffic and safety information even when their mobile phone network is saturated or out of range. For automakers, this hybrid solution delivers a fast and cost-efficient way of bringing new data services to the market, such as traffic and weather, alongside traditional radio programs. It adapts seamlessly with entry-level as well as high-end DAB radio and smart devices.\nVisteon brings decades of experience in digital radio receivers to the partnership, being first to launch the DAB+/DMB-A technology on a line-fit car radio.
