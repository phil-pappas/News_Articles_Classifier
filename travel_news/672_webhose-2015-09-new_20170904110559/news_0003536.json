For nine months of the year, the Russian-owned 50 Years of Victory clears shipping lanes for cargo vessels, crushing through thick pack ice. But in the summer, the ship does a short stint as an expedition vessel, ferrying 128 passengers to the North Pole. The highly praised trips, run by Quark Expeditions, were due to end last year, but Quark have secured the icebreaker for departures on their 14-day Ultimate Arctic Adventure until 2018. The ship is fitted with a helicopter and a hot-air balloon, and guests often see polar bears from the deck.\nWhy go: With increased demand for icebreakers by industrial and cargo ships in the Arctic region, there’s a high probability these voyages may become a thing of the past for the average tourist.\nBook a berth: In 2016 Quark offers two departures on June 15 and 26, costing from $US36,500 ($A50,900); a mandatory transfer package from Helsinki to Murmansk is an additional $US1750. Three voyages are planned for July 2017. See quarkexpeditions.com\nThe worlds largest nuclear icebreaker, \"NS 50 Lyet Pobyedi\" (50 years of Victory) on the way to the North Pole. Picture: Alamy SABLE ISLAND\nLocated 175km off the coast of mainland Canada, Sable Island is little more than a crescent-moon-shaped sandbar, but what makes it special is that it is home to a mob of more than 400 wild horses that originate from a colony of ponies abandoned in the 18th century. In 2013, the tiny island was declared a Canadian National Park Reserve and can only be visited by permit. Although seats are available on the small supply plane that supplies National Park staff (landing on the beach), Adventure Canada runs just one voyage to the island on the 198-passenger Ocean Endeavour each summer. The catch is that the heavy fog and wild weather mean there are no guarantees the zodiacs can land each day (at least 350 ships have been wrecked on the island’s coast). If they do land, visitors can see wild horses, grey seals and seabirds\nWhy go: This is a unique opportunity to explore a wilderness just opening up to tourism.\nBook a berth: Next year Adventure Canada offers a nine-day expedition on June 11 from $US2395, plus a $US250 Sable Island Discovery Fund fee. See adventurecanada.com. One Ocean Expeditions run a 10-day expedition from $US2995, departing July16. See oneoceanexpeditions.com\nWild horses grazing on Sable Island. Picture: iStock THE ‘OTHER’ ANTARCTICA\nMost Antarctica expeditions depart from South America for the Antarctic Peninsula, but you can count on one hand the number of departures from New Zealand for the Ross Sea Antarctica. Unlike travel to the Antarctic Peninsula, where there are fly-in, fly-out options for passengers, trips to the Ross Sea and Antarctica are serious expeditions with most departures running for up to 30 days. The difficulty of access, unpredictable ice conditions and time commitment necessary to the voyage are a huge part of the appeal for most visitors, who are drawn to the strong backbone of Australian exploration and history in the area.\nWhy go: If you’ve already experienced the Antarctic Peninsula, discover the other side of the great white south.\nBook a berth: Local operator Heritage Expeditions runs a limited number of departures from New Zealand each season on the 50-berth Spirit of Enderby starting at $US20,000. For 2016 departures, passengers are advised to book a year in advance. See heritage-expeditions.com. In December 2016, a special one-off, 27-day east Antarctica voyage is planned through Wild Earth Travel from $US16,000. See wildearth-travel.com\nA BIG PART OF THE CARGO\nThe RMS St Helena is the cruise to mark on your dance card for this summer season. The 156-passenger ship is a quirky blend of cargo ship and cruise vessel and for the past 26 years has been the only lifeline to the remote island of Saint Helena, a six-day journey from Cape Town. However, with the island’s first airport to open in March 2016, voyages there will stop in July 2016.\nWhy go: For cruise aficionados, this is the last opportunity to travel by sea to an outpost of the empire before the sun sets not only on one of the last commissioned British Royal Mail ships, but also before a small island is changed forever by aviation.\nBook a berth: Bookings for RMS St Helena are available online at rms-st-helena.com. A one-way berth from Cape Town to Saint Helena starts from £429 ($A924). However, there is limited availability for the final voyages. Discover the World also offers packages including accommodation and sightseeing on Saint Helena. See discover-the-world.co.uk\nThe Ocean Endeavour. Picture: Supplied WRANGEL ISLAND\nHead to the top of the world and you’ll find a pristine Arctic wilderness, a frozen polar bear nursery and the world’s largest population of Pacific walrus … and a pesky Russian naval presence. Featured on UNESCO World Heritage List for its incredible Arctic diversity, Wrangel Island is only accessible during summer and by special permit. Heritage Expedition’s 15-day Across the Top of the World tour departs Anadyr, Russia, each August. Zodiac cruises offer polar bear and walrus viewing.\nWhy go: Wrangel Island is one of the world’s most inaccessible and isolated wildlife hot spots. However, Russia has announced plans to develop a naval base on the island, and it’s uncertain what impact this will have.\nBook a berth: In 2016, Heritage Expeditions offers three voyages departing August 1, 15 and 29 from $US11,200. Charter flights from Nome, Alaska to Anadyr cost $US2000 or, alternatively, fly from Moscow. See heritage-expeditions.com\nBEST OF THE REST\nKeen to sail off into the sunset a different way? What about a supply ship voyage to Pitcairn Island, settled by mutineers from The Bounty and home to just a few dozen people? Or historic South Georgia, home to four million fur seals and the stunning Falkland Islands (both available through Auroraexpeditions.com.au ). Closer to home, NZ’s remote, treacherous sub-Antarctic islands, including historic Macquarie Island teem with wildlife ( heritage-expeditions.com ). For something different, cross the Atlantic with Lindblad Expeditions, who offer a 28-day Epic 108°: An Atlantic Odyssey cruise from South America to Europe in March-April 2016 ( expeditions.com ).\nOriginally published as Cruising to the end of the world", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/2ad9708549886017f198bcd2f3e3ecf0", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/df0da8f9a21f8e4ad064e3fe7cddc065", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a7412e999ad5164c61d24ff74b13bac1?width=650", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/travel/holiday-ideas/once-in-a-lifetime-ocean-journeys-to-push-you-out-of-your-comfort-zone/story-fnjjv4qv-1227512278043?sv=81e149ad6e8e7ca9d0755d58c12eb65b", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e1ee267f02fce88ba297faf32283a638", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cd6495223d9a3c63ad714d8a3630e6a4", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a89cfa4c01f257d703ef0f3fdfa1177f?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/07503218fc4604974d126e8f3bc7d0aa", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&maxRelated=6&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e18bc62ff2a26b2ef1ddcb356f366b3b?width=650"], "published": "2015-09-04T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:37:19.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
