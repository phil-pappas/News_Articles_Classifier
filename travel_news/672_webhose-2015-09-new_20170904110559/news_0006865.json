Manali is blessed with snow capped mountains, lush greenery, orchards, beautiful flora and chatting river and streams. The gorgeous landscapes covered in white are simply awe-inspiring. The best time to try this sport is from October to mid of May. The flights of hot air balloon are given early in the morning and in the evening before getting dark. The coldness of the atmosphere helps the balloon to go up to greater heights and float in the air for longer duration and to the possible highest points.\nCYCLING HOLIDAYS \n\nRegion: Sikkim \nPlan an exciting mountain biking holiday as your adventure holiday with your friends. Here is a tentative itinerary. On the first day, ride from Gangtok via Tami tea garden and arrive at Ravangla. On the second day, ride approx 35 kms from Ravangla to Tashiding which is a small village on a hilltop near Pelling. Also famous for its monastery that belongs to the Nyingmapa order and is highly revered among the people of Sikkim. Day three, spend a leisurely day starting from Tashiding to Yuksom as you stop by hamlets and soak in the gorgeous scenery. Start the fourth day by visiting the Norbugang Chorten in the morning ride to Khecheopalri Lake from Yuksam. Day five, after a breakfast in the outdoors, head towards Pemayangtse. The sixth and last day of the trip is one of the most hectic when you start by visiting the Pemayangtse Monastery and ride to Jorethang and by night reach Darjeeling. Your friends will always thank you for such an amazing offbeat vacation.\nBRAVING THE COLD \n\nRegion: Leh \nET-Travel reader John Williame shares his spine-chilling Chadar Trek experience. He says, \"In January 2014, I left Leh and started my journey in Zanskar through the Chadar. My goal was to reach Phuktal Monastery located after Padum and the Zanskar Valley. It took me 12 days to reach the monastery and another 10 days to come back to Leh. It was a fantastic experience. During that epic journey, I drank tea with the King of Padum, I saw wolves just a few meters away from my tent, I walked through a snowstorm on the way back, I attended several pujas, I slept under the stars where the temperature was minus 30 degree but most important I learned a lot about myself. The Chadar Trek is certainly difficult but does not require strong physical preparation as the trail is mostly flat. However, it can be very technical and may require some guts at some portion of the trail. Another difficult aspect that should not be neglected is the cold. You have to cope with it during the entire time of the hike. I witnessed people crying because they could not stand the cold or were not properly acclimatised. With the right mindset, the right set of gears and have a proper acclimatisation and trust towards your guide, then you will surely enjoy every bit of the trek.\"\nPARAGLIDING \n\nRegion: Bir and Billing \nEvery year, twice in May and October, paragliders from across the world descent on Bir and Billing, Himachal Pradesh. These twin towns Bir and Billing are among the top 10 paragliding destinations in the world.After hosting pre-world cup competition in these towns, the Paragliding World Cup 2015 will be organised from October 24-31, 2015 under the aegis of Paragliding World Cup Association, France. Bir is also well known for its Buddhist monasteries, Tibetan culture and handicrafts. The most important feature of this region is its weather. On bad weather days one can still fly 20-30 kms and on good days 100 kms is not difficult. October and November are the ideal months for flying in autumn and March to May is also flyable but conditions are very strong in spring with thermals of 6-12 mtrs/sec and cloudbase of 4000 to 6000 mtrs. Tourists can also head to Palampur that is located 29 kms from Bir and Baijnath is 13 kms away from Bir.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:45:42.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
