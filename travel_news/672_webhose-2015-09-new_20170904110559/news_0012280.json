Inside a book-lined office, the author brushed away a tear.\nHe had just related a poignant encounter with a pig. The first time he took his children to the Blue Hill Fair a few years ago, he had watched a prize sow suckling its young, eerily convinced he’d seen this before. And then he realized where: E. B. White’s “Charlotte’s Web.” “It was such a strange moment of language, time and reality converging,” Mr. Lethem mused. “If you know where to look in Blue Hill, there’s an undercurrent where time is stopped.”\nPoised at the cusp of Maine’s Downeast region, the Blue Hill peninsula is a spit of seaboard notable for its rough-hewn splendor. With rolling, moss-felted pinelands set against craggy coasts, boulder-strewn blueberry barrens and clapboard farmhouses flaking into painterly decrepitude, the scenery seems purpose-built to bring out the poet within. It is little wonder, then, that in recent years some of the best and brightest literary minds of the day have bought summer homes here, quietly transforming it into a writers’ enclave.\nPhoto Boats in the harbor in Castine, also on Blue Hill peninsula.

The pioneering cohort has since expanded to include Michael Chabon, Heidi Julavits, Ben Marcus, Edmund White, John Hodgman, Ayelet Waldman and a cast of critics and visual artists. In season, this tiny, sparsely populated landmass might boast a literary-superstar-to-square-mile ratio unequaled anywhere outside Brooklyn.\nWith stores few and far between and cellphone coverage chronically iffy, well-heeled New York holidaymakers, organic farmers and lobstermen coexist in rustic harmony. Is it Blue Hill’s homespun charm that exerts such a siren song on writers? Or do the calm rhythms of life lived close to nature allow those who summer here, as Flaubert said of orderly routines, “to be violent and original” in their work?\nPart of its allure may lie in geographical happenstance. With the humpback peaks of Mount Desert Island looming due east, developers (and lobster-crazy tourists) have long overlooked Blue Hill, lending it an air of hermetically preserved, frontier-outpost authenticity.\nBut the appeal is also undeniably social. “The natural rhythm of a writer is to alternate long stretches of solitude with bursts of socializing — with other writers — and Blue Hill is well-stocked,” said Edmund White, summer renter and the presiding doyen of gay American literature. Indeed, at lunchtime, Marlintini’s Bar & Grill often transforms into Downeast Maine’s answer to the Algonquin Hotel, a bygone haunt of Manhattan’s literary elite. In the afternoons, the Blue Hill Library is rife with literati tapping that rarest of extravagances in this part of the world — reliable Wi-Fi — to check email.\nPhoto Mary McCarthy’s former home in Castine.

Mr. Lethem characterized his daily routine as outings to Curtis Cove, cookouts and playdates.\nStill, the scribes don’t just keep to their own kind. Mr. Lethem, for instance, co-owns the Red Gap Bookstore with two locals, Marjorie Kernan and André Strong. In summer, they host a bimonthly poker game, to which all are welcome.\nThe current crop of writers is hardly the first to succumb to Blue Hill’s frozen-in-time seductions. In Castine, a bijou town of shipwright homes on the promontory’s east coast, the poet Robert Lowell shared a colonial with his wife, the novelist Elizabeth Hardwick, in the 1950s and ’60s. Nearby stands Mary McCarthy’s old digs, a house she painted buttercup yellow to rankle this primly whitewashed town’s citizenry.\nAcross the peninsula, in the hamlet of Brooklin, resided the reclusive E. B. White. White’s colonial — and the barn that housed the inspiration for literature’s most beloved pig — occupy a dramatic stretch of coastline overlooking Blue Hill Bay and Mount Desert Island.\nThe unspoiled landscape that enchanted White also drew Helen and Scott Nearing, progenitors of the back-to-the-land movement. Founded in 1952, their self-sufficient homestead in Cape Rosier has attracted generations of hippies and utopianists to Blue Hill, sowing an agro-bohemian vibe that remains immensely inviting to — and unfailingly accepting of — literary newcomers. “We were delighted when the writers showed up,” Ms. Kernan said. “It’s a welcoming place. Until you prove yourself to be a jerk, you’re fine.”\nAnd then there’s the other perk of Blue Hill’s remoteness: withdrawal into the peninsular equivalent of Proust’s cork-lined bedroom, sealed off from the frenzy of mainstream America. “What sinks in for me being here is that a lot of what’s in the news just seems to be flitting over the surface of human time,” said Mr. Lethem, a Brooklyn native. “And human time is moving much more slowly.”", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/06/travel/06HEADS2/06HEADS2-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/06/travel/06HEADS3/06HEADS3-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/06/travel/06HEADS2/06HEADS2-blog427.jpg", "http://www.marlintinisgrill.com/contact-us.html", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/06/travel/06HEADS3/06HEADS3-blog427.jpg", "http://www.redgapbooks.com/"], "published": "2015-09-01T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T16:08:55.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
