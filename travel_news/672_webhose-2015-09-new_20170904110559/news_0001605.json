For sight seeing You can take tourist bus from Lodge which charge Rs. 200 per person and it will take you North Goa one day and other day you can go to South Goa. It takes almost full day. If you like boat ride at COCO beach it charge Rs. 250 and for Mandovi river cruise it charge Rs. 250. In two days you will cover Goa and then you can decide on which beach you want to spend your other two days. Food cost almost same as your place, but your group can enjoy beer little cheaper then your place. If your group can drive Motorcycle/Scooter then it will economical. You can rent a Motorbike for Rs. 300 and petrol price extra.

You should be banned from this site for giving such ridiculous advice!!!! I'd personally stay at Benaulim next to Colva as it's more mellow and relaxed. But a lot of Indians prefer Colva. And it's just a nice 2 km. stroll along the beach between the two. And your not from Canada. You can't even speak proper English! \"Travel is fatal to prejudice,bigotry and narrow-mindedness\" Mark Twain", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T21:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T00:22:09.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
