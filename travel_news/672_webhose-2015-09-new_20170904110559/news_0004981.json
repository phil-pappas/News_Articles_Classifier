Obviously this involves a fairly outrageous fancy dress – complete with wig and full make-up. One year, a panicked last-minute publicity launch involved a call to my work asking me and Kev, who played my daft son, to race to the theatre, get changed and meet the director at the Royal Pump Rooms in Leamington. Tickets were not going well and the director had managed to bag a photographer. We were given a generous 45 minutes to travel from work, get ready and arrive – it was ridiculous, really, but that was the only time the photographer could make. As Kev and I worked at the same market research company, I drove. I was in full panto dame outfit, complete with scarlet wig, huge dress and lurid make-up We got to the theatre, quickly got ready, and raced to get to the Pump Rooms in my tiny blue Fiesta. We pulled up. I was in full panto dame outfit, complete with scarlet wig, huge dress, red Dr. Martens boots and lurid make-up. Kev looked like Tweedledum in striped short dungarees, rosy cheeks and exaggerated freckles. The photographer was quite clearly checking his watch and the director was looking worried. But there was nowhere to park. It was also rush hour and the Parade was jammed with late-night Christmas shoppers. We were about to get out and attempt to cross the road when a police officer approached us In desperation I double-parked in front of the entrance to the Jephson Gardens, right under a huge banner advertising our panto with mine and Kev’s faces bursting out. We were about to get out and attempt to cross the road when a police officer approached us. \"Is this your vehicle, er, sir?\" she asked. \"Yes,\" I replied, resisting the urge to answer in panto dame voice. \"Well, you can't park here. You'll have to move.\" I was about to lose my rag, but Kev very diplomatically asked if we could just have a few minutes to take a quick publicity photo. He pointed to the increasingly irate photographer and the banner above the car. He even offered a couple of complimentary tickets to the opening night. \"Oh. Panto, is it?\" she asked panto dame and daft son. Through gritted teeth, I replied: \"Yes.\" \"Are you in it?\" Sensing I was about to go into orbit, Kev replied: \"Oh no, love. Me mother and I are just doing a bit of late-night shopping.\" As told to Dominic Utton • During the Christmas season - and the rest of the year - the AA keeps you covered, no matter what happens on the road.
