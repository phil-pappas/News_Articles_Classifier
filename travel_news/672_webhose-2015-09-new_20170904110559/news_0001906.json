He added that the parliamentary elections will not affect the campaign’s launch date, which will begin from Egypt. \nJWT won the tender for the promotion plan announced by the Ministry of Tourism, which stipulates that the company will promote Egypt for three years using $22m annually, of which the company will obtain 3%-4%. \nElhamy El-Zayat, Chairman of the Egyptian Federation of Chambers of Tourism, said the current period requires dealing with the crisis in a professional manner involving all ministries, rather than leaving the Tourism Ministry to deal with the situation alone. “The situation is very difficult, and the sector is close to death,” El-Zayat said. \nEl-Zayat further called for creative solution to address the ongoing tourism crisis, which is currently in its fifth year. He demanded the ordering of priorities to provide the sectors’ workers with a vision, in cooperation with state bodies. Egypt’s total tourism income during the first seven months of this year amounted to $3.6bn. \nEl-Zayat warned that failure to handle the crisis will have negative results, whereby there are no revenues for the replacement and development operations of the hotels. This will, in turn, have a negative effect on the quality of services and Egypt’s competitiveness in relation to other regional destinations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T04:19:41.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
