The American conservationists Kristine and Douglas Tompkins have been buying land, restoring habitats and building public access to the park in the southern Aysen region bordering Argentina since 2000 with the goal of donating it to the government as a national park in the next few years. The new Stone House Campground, where the Aviles and Chacabuco Rivers meet, features seven covered cooking areas to shelter campers from the famed Patagonian winds and is open, like the rest of the park, through April. Getting there is no small feat, usually involving a flight from Santiago to Balmaceda, followed by a six- to eight-hour car or bus ride. For those who would rather not camp, the Britain-based Latin-American-specialist tour operator Pura Aventura aims to take on the planning, if not the driving, in a 13-day self-guided trip called Chile’s Southern Highway. The trip includes internal flights, airport transfers, rental car and overnights in Santiago and in eco-lodges in the Chacabuco Valley and other wilderness areas from £2,344 (about $3,480) per person, double occupancy. UNDERWATER STREAMING IN BONAIRE Last year, the Harbour Village Beach Club on Bonaire partnered with Coral Restoration Foundation Bonaire to plant new coral in an underwater garden in front of the property, and now the curious can get a glimpse of their progress without donning scuba tanks. Two new underwater cameras including one in the coral nursery and another on the nearby reef where the budding coral will eventually be transplanted have been installed and are providing live streaming during daylight hours. While the feeds could replace your office aquarium with virtual fish images, the cameras are intended for students studying marine life through educational groups including Teens 4 Oceans and View Into the Blue to provide the submarine view of plant growth. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T12:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:00:15.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
