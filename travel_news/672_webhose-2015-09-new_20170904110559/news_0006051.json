The Weekender makes it easy for subway riders to visualize exactly how weekend work will affect subway service.\nThe updated “Weekender for Mobile App,” which now includes MTA Subway Time data, is available for iPhone in the Apple app store, and I n the Google Play store for Android devices. This free-to-download app shares the same features as the desktop version, including a subway diagram that displays the service to be provided each weekend, and all service changes. Users can pinch or expand the map to multiple zoom levels, and tap to choose one of three ways to view service diversions: Service by Line, Service by Borough and Service by Station.\nCustomers can also download the apps at MTA. TripPlanner+ provides travel information that takes weekend service diversions into account. In addition, customers can receive customized subway diversion e-mails delivered to their inbox by signing up for the E-mail Subscription Program.\nThese weekend changes are necessary because of capital construction work on the MTA New York City Transit subway system. This work is part of NYC Transit’s ongoing Capital Rebuilding Program aimed at upgrading and maintaining our tracks, stations and signal systems in order to continue to provide our customers with safe and reliable service.\nSource:- MTA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T11:47:08.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
