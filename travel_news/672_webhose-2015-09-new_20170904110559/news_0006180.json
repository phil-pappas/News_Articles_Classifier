Dialogues are very important for the betterment of the people of Seychelles and also for the prosperity of the country.” \nThis statement was made by the SCCI Chairman, Mr. Marco Francis, after he attended a meeting this morning, chaired by the Vice President of Seychelles, Mr. Danny Faure. Present during the meeting was the Ministers of Labor and Employment; Minister Edith Alexander; and the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr. Charles Bastienne. Representatives from the SHTA were also present for the meeting. \nThe main objective of the meeting was to discuss the pertinent issue regarding the GOP application process as well as the renewal processes. Mr. Francis remarked that several of the SCCI members approached his office to express constraints they encounter vis-a-vis the GOP procedures in general. Mr. Francis said that the constraints often have a negative effect on the businesses, especially on the financial side. \nMr. Francis pointed out that he is personally satisfied with the outcome of the meeting, as it has been agreed that as from October 1 of this year, the processes for GOP will no longer be more than 9 working days. Mr. Francis said that this is a great achievement as the private sector has been pushing for this for a long time. \nTo conclude, Mr. Francis expressed his appreciation towards the government to work closely and to listen to the private sector’s voices. He hopes that in the spirit of PPPs the relationship will be long lasting. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
