(Richard Graulich / The Palm Beach Post) “I knew I was going for the two points,” Boca Raton coach Eric Davis said. “I told the coaches before the last drive that we were going for the two-point conversion. I told Philip Santiago that we weren’t going to drag this out. No Kansas tiebreaker.”\nBoth offenses started slowly, with Boca Raton (2-0) failing to reach midfield on its first two drives and No. 6 Palm Beach Gardens throwing an interception on its first offensive series.\nBut the Gators (1-1) found their footing on their next drive, opening a 7-0 lead on an 8-yard touchdown pass from Hunter Aranda to Amari Carter.\nRichard Graulich Palm Beach Gardens #1 Devin Studstill runs for gain against Boca Raton’s #5Albert McGinnis during the first half in Palm Beach Gardens on September 4, 2015. (Richard Graulich / The Palm Beach Post) Palm Beach Gardens worked with a short field on the drive, starting from the Boca Raton 23 after a dominating defensive series pushed the Bobcats back deep into their own territory.\n“I hate giving them the upper hand early,” Davis said.\nAnother strong defensive series gave Palm Beach Gardens the ball back near midfield, and the Gators got close enough for a 47-yard field goal attempt.\nBut Ricky Rais’ kick was wide right, leaving Palm Beach Gardens with a 7-0 lead with 7:56 left in the second quarter.\nBoca Raton finally found its offensive rhythm on its next drive. With running back Bryce Hill leading the way, the Bobcats marched into Gators territory but Devin Studstill intercepted near the goal line.\nThe Gators handed the ball right back, fumbling deep in their own territory.\nThe Bobcats tied it two plays later on Santiago’s 1-yard run.\nBoca Raton’s defense stiffened from there, while the Gators’ defense imploded.\nAfter a Gardens punt, Hill and the Bobcats marched 61 yards on six plays, scoring on Santiago’s 9-yard touchdown pass to Charles Barnes. The Gators were flagged four times in the series, which closed with Boca Raton holding a 14-7 lead.\nPalm Beach Gardens regrouped to open the third quarter, scoring on a pair of long touchdown passes to open a 21-14 lead.\nAranda connected on a 45-yard scoring pass to Carter at 10:14, and then hit Errol Roberts on a 50-yarder at 6:26.\nSantiago’s 24-yard strike to McGinnis Albert at 8:15 of the fourth quarter tied it at 21 before the Gators regained the lead on Donnell Perry’s 6-yard scoring run.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/09/04/4b/5f/090515-HS-football-gardens-boca-5.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/09/04/c4/94/090515-HS-football-gardens-boca-6.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-05T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T06:10:35.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
