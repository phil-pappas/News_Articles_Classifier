T he ‘One Break, Two Cities’ package means GCC visitors can easily combine two or more cities, across two countries, in one memorable holiday. As well as highlighting the Visa Waiver Scheme, Tourism Ireland is also emphasising ease of access from the Middle East to the island of Ireland – with direct flights to Dublin from Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways and from Dubai, with Emirates.”\nLast year, Ireland welcomed about 55,000 visitors from the GCC. Amanda Burns continued: “2014 was a record year for visitor numbers from Ireland’s long-haul markets – and 2015 is also looking positive, with the most recent CSO figures showing growth of +7% in visitor numbers from our emerging markets for May to July. Tourism Ireland is determined to ensure that this growth continues and our busy autumn campaign is now in full swing.”\nSource:- Tourism Ireland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T14:57:37.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
