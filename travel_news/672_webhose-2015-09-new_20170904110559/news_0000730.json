While Airfield Safety Officers at SFO conduct runway safety checks multiples times every day, the Runway FOD Walk allows airport workers to participate and be involved in preventing items from becoming FOD.\n“Our culture of safety focuses on each and every employee at SFO playing an active role in promoting a safe operating environment,” said Airport Director John L. Martin. “From wellness initiatives to safety briefings and meetings, we have a lot of ways for employees to get involved. Our annual FOD walk is a fun way to raise awareness while contributing to our #1 goal of safety at all times.”\nWorking in collaboration with the FAA air traffic control tower, the Airport will briefly close two runways to allow employee volunteers to walk the runway areas, picking up any trash which could become FOD. Participants will also be treated to bus tour of the airfield, followed by a complementary lunch.\nMedia are welcome to cover the FOD walk at SFO. Details are as follows:\nWHAT: SFO Annual Runway FOD Walk\nWHEN: Wednesday, September 30, 2015 Exercise runs from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. Media must arrive no later than 8:45 a.m. for escort VISUAL: Employees walking two closed runways, collecting Foreign Object Debris (FOD) Airfield and San Francisco Fire Department-Airport Bureau equipment Aircraft operations, airfield views RSVP & CONTACT: Please RSVP to Doug Yakel, Public Information Officer at (650) 821-4000.\nPARKING:\nMedia wishing to cover the event must report to the South Field checkpoint NO LATER THAN 8:45 a.m. for escort onto the runway area.
