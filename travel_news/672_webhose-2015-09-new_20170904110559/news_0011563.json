According to these reports, the alleged improprieties concern the reinstatement of unprofitable flights from Newark Liberty International Airport to Columbia, South Carolina – the weekend home airport of the Authority’s chairman – in return for improvements and benefits the airline wanted at the airport.\nAs CNBC reports today, “Shortly after the agency approved a new United hangar at Newark, as well as financial incentives for its construction, the airline moved forward with plans to resume service from Newark to Columbia, according to media reports.”\nAs part of the Authority’s $8 billion capital improvement plan, announced in 2014, United also reportedly sought rail service to Lower Manhattan, and other benefits, including airport rent reduction. It would appear from press reports that while United was accusing the Gulf carriers of receiving government subsidies, the airline itself was agreeing – perhaps in violation of U.S. laws – to special subsidies and other competitive advantages and benefits.\n“United Airlines’, Delta Air Lines’ and American Airlines’ (the “Big 3”) recent anti-competitive and anti-consumer behavior in seeking to deprive consumers of new competitive choices and alternatives by blocking Norwegian Air International’s application before the U.S. Department of Transportation and alleging that the Gulf carriers (Emirates Airlines, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways) have received $42 billion in government subsidies is contemptible and must be challenged,” stated BTC founder Kevin Mitchell.\n“Now that the Big 3 have secured their antitrust immunized global alliances and radical domestic U.S. consolidation, they want to cry foul and accuse some competitors of accepting subsidies while being silent on their own massive subsidies and structural advantages. They want to raise the drawbridge and foreclose on foreign airline new entry in the U.S. by labeling stiff competition as unfair,” added Mitchell.\nA Congressional Research Services report completed in 1999, but only recently published by WikiLeaks, detailed how the U.S. federal government spent $155 billion through 1998 in support of aviation activities to help establish the industry. And the Risk Advisory Group this year released a report that details some $71 billion in financial support and benefits for U.S. airlines since 1999 in, among other areas, bankruptcy debt relief, pension termination and fuel subsidies. This brings the total for U.S. airlines conservatively to $226 billion in financial support, special benefits and structural advantages. However, there is not one airline on earth complaining about this U.S. support, or unleveled playing field vis-à-vis U.S. airlines; they simply compete.\nSource:-United Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T07:09:00.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
