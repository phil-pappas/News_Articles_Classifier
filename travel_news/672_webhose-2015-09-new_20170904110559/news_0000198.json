The headline event is the Global Sustainable Aviation Summit, hosted by the industry-wide body, the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG). Climate change, the recent UN Sustainable Development Goals, sustainable alternative aviation fuels, new technologies, dealing with aircraft noise and emerging environmental issues – including finding ways to tackle the illegal trade in wildlife – are all on the agenda. \nExecutive Director of ATAG, Michael Gill, says that the Summit and associated meetings are a chance to bring experts and leaders from across the aviation industry together in one place, “there are a number of key environment challenges that the industry is working on, together with governments. Climate change is a subject that all parts of society are tackling. Aviation has taken a proactive approach and united together to advance its own plans, including ambitious goals for reducing emissions. We will be discussing those goals and the measures being taken to meet them this week – including the important work to design a global market-based measure for air transport from 2020.” \nKeynote speakers at the Summit include André Borschberg, the CEO and pilot for the record-breaking Solar Impulse challenge; John Scanlon, Secretary General of CITES; and Dr. Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu, President of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Council. ATAG, representing industry, and ICAO, representing governments, collaborate closely on climate change solutions within the sector. \nAirports Council International (ACI), ACI Europe, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the Aircraft Fleet Recycling Association (AFRA) are also hosting environmental working group meetings during this Geneva Green Aviation Week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T02:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T02:39:21.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
