Published on : Tuesday, September 22, 2015\nWith the Jakarta edition, the Ballantine’s Team-Am Golf Challenge owned & organized by Golftripz has completed 6 successful international amateur tournaments.\nA smashing success with 220 golfers and a total group size of 250, Edition 6 is undoubtedly the biggest event in the series. Golfers from cities across India registered their teams for a 5 day/4 Night/3 Rounds of Golf extravaganza.\nThe entire experience was taken a notch higher with two different hotel choices, the best courses, private van transfers, personal guides and much more.\nJakarta’s bustling life and quality of golf courses took many by surprise and golfers have rated it as a very interesting golf destination with the intention to come back. The competition as usual was intense and top contenders for the 50 prizes were tightly lined up, making for a close finish. The Swingers team from Delhi – Aditya Gupta, Pankaj Sharma, Sidharth Chaudhary and Simran Sachdev emerged winners with all four team members delivering formidable rounds of golf.\nBallantine’s, the Title Sponsor, has continued to extend its unflinching support to the event. And Wonderful Indonesia (Tourism Team) was also on board as Associate Sponsor, lending its support in making this a top class experience and showing golfers a flavour of what Indonesia can offer visitors. We would like to especially thank Baltic Tour & Travel, our ground handler in Jakarta who provided fantastic support to make this event a great success.\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:35:57.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
