Since each trip is tailored to suit the individual travellers’ interests, they are not tied to set tour itineraries and can ‘do it their way’.\nFounded by a historian with a passion for travel and appreciation of the world’s heritage and its natural wonders, Battered Suitcase recognises that well-travelled people are looking for new and meaningful experiences without compromising on luxury. By combining their specialist knowledge with an understanding of the traveller’s needs, the tour operator meticulously plans tailored itineraries. Regions covered include Asia and the Indian subcontinent; Australasia; the Americas; Africa; the Middle East; Europe and Great Britain.\nThe operator’s online brochure gives examples of tours with guide prices, most with flights and visits to UNESCO World Heritage Sites, but these can be tailored to suit. They include 14 day cultural heritage and natural heritage tours of Argentina from £4,125 per person; 15 days discovering China’s fascinating World Heritage Sites from £2,775; an 18 day voyage of discovery in Western Australia from £5,547; eight day heritage journey through Tanzania from £2,888; 10 day cultural tour of Sicily from £4,594 and, just introduced, four days in Bremen and Bremerhaven, Germany from £399.\nFor visitors wishing to explore the UK, the 11 day Highlights of Great Britain tour takes in Scotland and the north and south of England from £2,888, while Heritage Highlights of London visits UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the capital and south over 10 days from £2,100.\nDestinations are tried and tested by a member of the Battered Suitcase team who tirelessly conduct field research. The company partners ethically and responsibly with local providers to try and ensure that the revenue generated stays in the local economy. As a result, travellers benefit from the wealth of knowledge that only a local tour guide can offer, while accommodation is in smaller boutique, privately run hotels, as opposed to chains, providing a total immersive and personal experience.\nBattered Suitcase is a fully bonded tour operator with all flights and flight-inclusive holidays financially protected by the ATOL scheme through their membership of the Travel Trust Association.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T20:11:54.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
