Many of these beaches remain a well-kept secret, discovered only by dive enthusiasts and anglers who venture off the beaten track. Here are our recommendations for the best beaches to visit in Belize. \nBy Lebawit Lily Girma \nPlacencia Peninsula \nGetty Images \nThe Placencia Peninsula is home to the longest stretch of beach in mainland Belize. Dubbed “barefoot perfect,” it’s the most popular sea and sand getaway in the country and stretches across 3 villages: Maya Beach, Seine Bight and Placencia Village. Take your pick — all of these beaches are public. Placencia Village’s tourist strip area has several bars and restaurants along its golden sandy coastline; whereas fine, white sand beaches are found along quiet Seine Bight and Maya Beach. Placencia is also an easy best beach pick because of its top-notch food, accommodations, nightlife and its decent mix of travelers and locals. \nHopkins Village Beach \nWalter Rodriguez, Wikimedia Commons \nHopkins Village Beach is located in the eastern Garífuna village of Hopkins, a mere 40-minute drive south of the town of Dangriga. This uninterrupted, quiet 5-mile beach is lined with coconut trees, locals’ homes, colorful guesthouses and a few local eateries. The waters aren’t Caribbean turquoise, but clear and refreshing nonetheless. \nIn between swimming and sunning, experience Garífuna culture at its best. Stop by Innie’s Restaurant for a plate of hudut , fish soaked in a coconut stew, served with mashed plantains. Take drumming lessons at the Lebeha Drumming Center or play dominoes with residents of this Afro-Amerindian village. You can also bike your way over to neighboring False Sittee, where you’ll find more glorious, bare stretches of beaches facing resorts, bars and restaurants.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T14:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T17:39:40.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
