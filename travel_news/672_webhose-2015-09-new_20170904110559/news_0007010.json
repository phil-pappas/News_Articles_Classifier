The program brings together British Airways, Iberia and American Airlines business program allowing customers to collect and spend on all three under one scheme.\nThe new and improved On Business programme, which already saves customers £30million a year on flights, now rewards points based on spend rather than distance travelled or number of flights.\nTo mark the re-launch of On Business loyalty programme, British Airways is delighted to offer SMEs the opportunity to win a seat on an exclusive mentoring flight to Austin, Texas – the heartland of innovation in the USA. To enter the competition, eligible participants must complete the entry form on and submit in approximately 150 words why they should be on the flight and the benefit that this would provide for their business or employer.\nThis presents a once in a lifetime opportunity for businesses to win a chance to interact, learn and share experience with ace entrepreneur and mentoring experts, Josh Baer and Steve Welch from the Austin-based Capital Factory, known as a centre of gravity for start-ups in the United States. The competition is open to SMEs in the UK, Northern Ireland, India and South Africa. It is open till 14 September 2015 23:59 IST and the prize flights are valid for travelling First outbound on 20 October 2015 and return in Club World on 22 October 2015 .\nBritish Airways spokesperson Moran Birger, British Airways’ regional commercial manager, South Asia said: “Our research told us members wanted a programme which was simple to understand, helped them manage their travel costs and recognised them for all of their spend with us. The changes we’ve made do exactly this. A simple way of earning points based on spend, a simple way of delivering immediate savings through discounts and tiers to reward loyalty.\n“We understand the needs of small and medium size businesses, and the changes will allow us to coordinate benefits, increase rewards and help stretch travel budgets across the British Airways, Iberia, and American Airlines network. The revitalised On Business will also better meet the flying needs of this dynamic and growing sector. It will be simple to understand and easy to use, improve the management of members’ travel costs and reward their spend.\n“In addition, the British Airways’ Mentoring Flight will give a lucky group of specially selected SMEs the once in a lifetime opportunity to receive brilliant business support through two amazing mentors from one of the world’s best business incubators, the Capital Factory.”\nNew benefits to the popular platform include:\nThree Tier ranking system to boost earning power Handpicked offers and bonuses for members A new easy to use online account management tool The new On Business has been made more flexible so members who want immediate savings can choose an upfront discount off flights if that works better for their company than collecting points.\nA three Tier system has been introduced which relates to the amount customers spend on travel each year. As users progress through the Tiers, they save more to spend on reward flights and upgrades.\nEntry tier members can earn enough points for a return reward ticket from India to the UK simply by spending on three return tickets to New York in British Airways’ Club World (business cabin). For example, three return tickets from Delhi to New York in club world will earn you a free return ticket from Delhi to London Heathrow.\nBusiness travellers flying on behalf of their company will collect On Business points which benefit the whole organisation as they can be redeemed on upgrades and reward flights for any staff member flying across the British Airways, American Airlines and Iberia network. The team member travelling for business also personally benefits under the airline’s Executive Club, as they can collect Avios points when they fly for business, which they can redeem on personal travel giving them more opportunity to travel and obtain upgrades.\nAs part of the changes, On Business has launched a brand new website, which will make it even easier for members to maximise their earning potential and spend their points effectively. It will also give access to custom reporting, as well as a clear view of who is earning where and when to help make further savings.\nSource:- British Airways", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T11:24:57.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
