It is a unique opportunity for Glasgow to showcase why it is open for business and a great place to invest, work and live to the airport’s 22 million annual business travellers. \nThe Glasgow advertisements at Heathrow highlight the city’s position as a world-class tourism and investment destination. The campaign also reflects the ease of access to Scotland’s largest city as well as its unrivalled connectivity to the global marketplace through the UK’s only hub airport. \nServing more than 180 global destinations, Heathrow connects to Glasgow Airport with nine daily services transporting over 900,000 passengers annually. \nBailie Liz Cameron, Glasgow City Council’s Executive Member for Jobs and the Economy, and Vice-Chair of Glasgow City Marketing Bureau, said: “Heathrow attracts some 22 million business passengers each year and Glasgow will be featured across the airport during what is one of Heathrow’s busiest periods. This opportunity provides us with a significant, high-profile platform from which to reinforce Glasgow’s position as the powerhouse of Scotland’s economy. \nAs the UK’s only hub airport, access to Heathrow offers the greatest frequency of international connections for travellers. Strong aviation connectivity is a key enabler of economic growth in Glasgow, facilitating trade with existing and new emerging markets, attracting global investment and supporting tourism, especially from long haul destinations.” \nHeathrow CEO John Holland-Kaye said: “As the UK’s only hub airport, Heathrow is our front door for global investors. I hope that by encouraging them to visit and invest in Glasgow, we can help to grow businesses and create jobs in the region.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T14:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T00:26:44.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
