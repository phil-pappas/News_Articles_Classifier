The training center is housed in Chief's Irvine specification and research facility, and will host sessions developed for collision repair technicians and estimators throughout the year.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150922/269246\nChief opened the Irvine facility as its North American specification center in 2011. It is where Chief technicians personally measure more than 100 new vehicles every year to develop the specification data that is vital for properly repairing collision-damaged vehicles. Chief University classes are held at educational facilities around the country, making it easy for technicians to find a location close to home. The new Irvine training center will serve technicians and insurance appraisers in the Western United States .\n\"The Irvine specification center is a perfect location for Chief University training courses,\" says Ken Boylan , global training manager for Chief. \"Trainees who take advantage of this facility will not only be able to participate in classes that cover the latest techniques and tools, but they will also get a glimpse at how Chief is developing data for the vehicles they will be repairing in the future. This unique experience will help give participants a better understanding of modern collision repair practices.\"\nTo create the new training center, Chief partitioned its Irvine facility into sections devoted to classroom learning and hands-on training. The hands-on space is outfitted with a Chief impulse ® -E/VHT frame rack, along with the latest Chief structural holding, measuring, welding and aluminum repair tools. This equipment can be set up to simulate real-world repair environments that enhance the course material.\nSeveral Chief University courses will be held in Irvine next year. Others that will be held in locations across the country through the end of 2015 are listed below.
