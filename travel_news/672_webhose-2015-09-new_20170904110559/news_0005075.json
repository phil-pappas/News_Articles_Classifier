This decline outpaced the 3.0% GDP contraction in Venezuela during the same period, reflecting the growing impact of draconian government policies on airlines, including restrictions on the repatriation of currency. IATA urged the Venezuelan government to reform the country’s air transport policies to avert a further deterioration of the country’s already limited air connectivity.\n“The Venezuelan government’s policies are crippling the air transport sector and depriving its people of the economic benefits that it could bring. Air travel options in Venezuela are diminishing while the country’s citizens and businesses pay more to travel due to the negative impact of government policies. The 8.5% fall in passenger numbers is significant. By contrast, other key Latin American economies saw passenger growth in the 2 to 12% range. An urgent change of policies is needed,” said Tony Tyler, IATA’s Director General and CEO.\nPassenger Traffic Ranking by Country, Latin America and Caribbean 2014\nCountry\nCountry Passengers Variation 2013/2014 Brazil 98,728,427 6.3% Mexico 58,119,723 6.8% Colombia 26,955,886 6.9% ​Argentina ​19,574,495 ​3.2% ​Chile ​14,743,832 ​3.8% ​Peru ​13,855,587 ​2.5% ​Venezuela ​11,420,070 ​-8.5% ​Domincan Republic ​10,426,839 ​11.9%", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T06:03:11.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
