However, to the extent that these circumstances have raised questions about diesel technology in general, we offer the following:\nThe circumstances involving a single manufacturer do not define an entire technology, or an industry. Vehicle manufacturers and engine makers have invested billions of dollars in research and development to successfully meet the most aggressive emissions standards in the world. They continue to work closely and cooperatively with the Environmental Protection Agency, California Air Resources Board, international regulatory bodies, as well as environmental and other interest groups toward common goals.\nNothing has changed the fact that the diesel engine is the most energy efficient internal combustion engine. It is a proven technology and its unique combination of efficiency, power, reliability, performance, low-emissions and suitability for using renewable fuels ensures a place for diesel technology to help meet the demands of a global economy.\nWe are also confident that consumers will continue to find the new generation of clean diesel cars, trucks and SUVs as a competitive choice to meet their personal transportation needs.\nFinally, it is important to focus forward on the significant accomplishments of an entire industry that developed and refined clean diesel technology to what it is today - a key strategy in achieving current and future energy and climate goals.\nConnect with DTF\nFor the latest insights and information from the leaders in clean diesel technology, join us on Facebook , follow us on Twitter @DieselTechForum, or YouTube @DieselTechForum and connect with us on LinkedIn .\nABOUT THE DIESEL TECHNOLOGY FORUM\nThe Diesel Technology Forum is a non-profit organization dedicated to raising awareness about the importance of diesel engines, fuel and technology. Forum members are leaders in clean diesel technology and represent the three key elements of the modern clean-diesel system: advanced engines, vehicles and equipment, cleaner diesel fuel and emissions-control systems.
