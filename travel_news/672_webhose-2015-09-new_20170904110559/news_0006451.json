Mirjam Pronk Holland is famous for its windmills, so no one will be surprised to learn that the worlds tallest windmills are to be found here. However, few Dutch, let alone tourists, will be able to tell you where they stand. And people might not even believe it when told that they are not out in the fields, but in heart of the most densely populated areas on the globe, near the second largest port in the world.\nSchiedam lies to the west of Rotterdam , from where it is easily reached by public transport. Surrounded by 20th-century commercial and residential areas is the small yet charming 18th century town center, looking like a pocket-size Amsterdam. At the western edge of Schiedams old center, lined up along the former outer canal, stand the worlds five tallest windmills. \nTheir location explains their height. When the windmills were built, between 1770 and 1803, they stood in what was then the edge of town and the industrial area. They were built for the grinding of grain needed for the distillation of gin, then Schiedams main industry. To catch as much wind as possible, they were made to stand high above the city, which came to lie at their feet. \nIn those days the canal was a moat, and the other side of the moat only flat farmland. That area started being built early in the 20th century, and now it is a semi-urban area of little architectural distinction. The result of this development for the windmills is that they are now surrounded by buildings and are part of the urban landscape. The highest windmills in the world stand in the middle of town. \nThese five windmills are what remain of an original twenty, the others having been made redundant by steam engines. In 1880, those twenty mills ground grain for the nearly 400 distilleries that made the famous jenever of Schiedam, where more gin was produced than in any other city in the world. Schiedam can no longer make that claim, but two of the five remaining windmills do still grind grain for the jenever industry. The blades of the other three windmills still turn as well, but only for show. Three of the five can be visited to see the interior: one houses a shop, one a museum and the third a restaurant. \nIn 1981 the Schiedam Windmills Society was founded. The Societys aim is to assist in the operation and maintenance of these unique windmills, which had previously been badly neglected. In celebration of the Societys 25th anniversary, on April 28 and 29 the blades of all five windmills will turn non-stop for 25 hours. \nLets take a walk along the five windmills in Schiedam.
