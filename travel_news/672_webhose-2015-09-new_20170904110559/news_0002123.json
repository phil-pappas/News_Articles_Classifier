Jetwing Yala is the only Sri Lankan property to be recognized this year, winning the award for Best Resource Efficiency – which is given to properties that exhibit “excellence in waste, water and energy management and sustainable architectural design in order to minimize environmental impact.” \nJetwing Yala was launched in January 2014, and has quickly established itself as the beacon of the Deep South of Sri Lanka. Featuring 80 rooms and 10 luxury tented villas, Jetwing Yala brings world class luxury and hospitality to the wilderness of Yala, in a stunning location overlooking massive sand dunes and the vibrant hues of the Indian Ocean. The entire property was designed from ground up to be as sustainable as possible, to match the local ecosystem by maximizing natural ventilation and lighting, along with muted colors to complement the surroundings. \nEnergy conservation initiatives include illumination through 100% LED lighting and feature LED backlit TVs in guest rooms; a biomass boiler that burns cinnamon wood (sourced through local suppliers) for night time hot water generation along with providing steam for an absorption chiller which supplies the hotel’s entire air conditioning needs (similar to Jetwing Lagoon); a central solar hot water system for daytime demand; and the largest privately opened solar park in the country that is already providing 40% of the hotel’s daily electricity demand. \nIn addition, no organic waste is taken outside the property - treated on-site to ensure 100% recycling and used as organic fertilizer for the hotel gardens. Waste water is also treated on-site, through an effluent treatment plant which is used in the gardens once again and in the air-conditioning cooling towers. \nAccepting the award, Gamunu Srilal, General Manager of Jetwing Yala, praised the commitment shown by the entire Jetwing group, saying: “At Jetwing, we believe that the hospitality industry is one that should benefit everyone and the country itself – whether it be by developing communities, providing livelihoods, and by causing as little impact as possible. Jetwing Yala has been at the forefront of the Jetwing family’s efforts to continuously improve in terms of responsible tourism and we look forward to welcoming the world to our beautiful island.” \nFamily owned and in the tourism industry for the past 42 years, Jetwing Hotels has surpassed expectation at every aspect. Building on their foundation of being passionate, as well as the experience of true, traditional Sri Lankan hospitality, constantly pioneering discoveries captures the essence of the brand. Such a strong statement and direction have enabled Jetwing Hotels to imagine, create and manage marvels and masterpieces, where distinctive design and elegant comfort complement each other and the environment. Considered a priority, sustainable and responsible practice is implemented through the award winning Jetwing Eternal Earth Program; with energy efficiency, community upliftment, and education of earth saving measures to schoolchildren being a few tenets of the Program.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T23:40:31.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
