I love learning, and I will continue to learn until I drop. Hopefully I’ll still be going strong well into my 90s.” \nAs the founder of the Virgin Group made up of more than 400 companies worldwide, Branson enjoys a lifestyle most of us cannot begin to fathom. \nENTREPRENEUR: SEVEN THINGS I LEARNED FROM SIR RICHARD Plenty to smile about ... Sir Richard is the first to admit he has an extraordinary life but he works hard at it. Picture: Tara Croser / News Corp Australia Source: News Corp Australia \nWorth an estimated $7.3 billion, his average week can see him kitesurfing in Noosa , meeting world leaders or visiting his spaceflight company Virgin Galactic in California. \nNo-one is more aware of his good fortune than the man himself. \n“I have the most extraordinary, rewarding life,” he says, grinning his trademark toothy smile. \n“Every day I meet fascinating, interesting new people which is why I think I have a permanent smile on my face. I can’t get it off.” \nThe grin soon disappears when discussing the issues he is most passionate about. \nIn his 65th year, Branson’s social conscience and outspoken stance on such issues as the environment and human rights almost threaten to eclipse the fun-loving larrikin image he has fostered so well. \nHe embraces the term “philanthropist” as much as he does “entertainer”, “adventurer” and “entrepreneur”. \n“I think that with wealth comes great responsibility and I’ve also got public recognition which helps enormously with that responsibility,” he says. \n“Every day I’m trying to use the position I find myself in to try to get change, hopefully positive change. \n“If I want to write a letter ... I know that letter will be read and I know I’ll get an answer. “Whether I’ll succeed, who’s to know.” Busy bee ... Sydney one day, Brisbane the next, Vietnam on the weekend — it’s Sir Richard’s life. Picture: Craig Greenhill / News Corp Australia Source: News Corp Australia \nHaving dropped out of school at age 16, Branson regularly rails against academia and insists the best education is gained through living life. \nAnd one of the most important lessons he has learned, is that the current approach to illicit drugs by countries like Australia and the UK is not working. \nA firm believer in drug addiction being treated as a health problem rather than a criminal one, Branson is a member of the Global Drug Commission that lobbies governments for change. \n“Countries that have decriminalised all drugs are the ones that are getting on top of drug problems,” he says. \n“Portugal is a good example. Ten years ago, they said nobody would ever go to jail again for taking drugs. \n“They had a big heroin problem in Portugal, and that’s been reduced by 90 per cent.” \nHe wants governments to become “more sympathetic” and to learn what assistance works, and what assistance doesn’t work. \n“Governments spend a fortune pushing (drugs) into the underworld, and the underworld makes $390 billion a year from selling drugs,” Branson says. \n“They’ve got all this money being spent on customs officers, police, courts. All this money could go into advertising saying how dangerous it is, like cigarettes. \n“It could be spent on social workers and in clinics helping people who’ve got drug problems get off drugs, and become useful members of society.” Influential ... When Sir Richard Branson talks, people listen. Picture: Tara Croser / News Corp Australia Source: News Corp Australia \nA visit to the Kings Cross needle exchange centre in Sydney this week, only served to bolster his views. \nBranson spent time talking to many of the drug addicts coming to collect clean needles and was impressed such a service was on offer. \n“I realised how wonderful needle exchanges are, how many more needle exchanges are needed and how much more Australia can do for its people who are taking drugs,” he says. \n“A lot of this taking drugs, especially things like heroin, it’s almost like a pain fix. \n“Society has not treated these people well.” \nEnvironmental issues are also close to Branson’s heart, and he admits to being misinformed when he described the Great Barrier Reef as being an “industrial dumping ground” this year. Unfinished business ... Sir Richard plans to keep working and learning ‘till he drops’. Picture: Tara Croser / News Corp Australia Source: News Corp Australia \nHe’s currently campaigning the West Australian Government to abandon its policy of allowing drum lines where sharks are deemed a threat to public safety. \nAnd Branson will spend this weekend in Vietnam, protesting the importation of rhinoceros horns. \nOne area where Branson’s wealth and influence has failed to make a difference, is the terrible conflict in Syria. \nIt is possibly a measure of the man’s ego that he believes he can succeed where everyone else has failed, to find a middle ground with the extreme terrorist group Islamic State. \nIn typical Branson style however, he is not giving up — with the help of the human rights group he conceived with musician Peter Gabriel known as the Elders . \nInitially chaired by the late Nelson Mandela, the heavyweight group works to avert international conflict and promote human rights. \nMembers include former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan , former US President Jimmy Carter , Mandela’s widow Graca Machel and former Irish President Mary Robinson . \n“It’s the thing I’m most proud of,” says Branson. \n“They’ve just been to Russia and met President Putin. They’re trying to bridge the gap between Russia and America to try to get them working together to resolve the Syrian conflict.” \n“If we can stop these conflicts, then education can commence. Health and everything else flows from that and we don’t have these big refugee problems. \n“That’s the most important thing I’m doing.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T16:41:48.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
