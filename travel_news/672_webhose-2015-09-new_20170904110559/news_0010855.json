(Huge commercial vessels of over 1,000 tons may request openings at any time.)\nHaving the limits in effect for just those four hours does not reflect growing traffic congestion or extended commute times, the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) argued in a statement Tuesday morning .\nScott Kubly, city transportation director, said at a news conference that he hopes to get the Coast Guard to allow fewer openings to be scheduled each day, with more boats passing through each time. A drawbridge might rise only once instead of twice, for instance, between 6 and 7 p.m.\n “The pleasure craft, we want to have scheduled openings so people in their boats know when to show up, and motorists can plan accordingly,” he said.\nAs an example of how early-evening span openings can slow traffic, the city noted that in the last week of August 2014, there were 11 weekday Ballard Bridge openings between 6 and 7 p.m., most for sailboats, while an average 2,600 vehicles crossed during that same hour.\nCongestion tends to stretch one mile on either side of the bridge, causing pollution from idling cars. The average opening lasts 4.8 minutes and can require 10 minutes for traffic to clear, said John Buswell, city head of roadway structures.\nStill, Kubly may find it difficult to persuade the federal government to encroach on marine travel, which built Seattle before the auto age. The Ballard and Fremont bridges were built in 1917, the University Bridge in 1919 — shortly after the Lake Washington Ship Canal and Ballard Locks enabled crosstown navigation.\nVessel movement is paramount in U.S. codes, said Steve Fischer, Northwest bridge administrator for the Coast Guard. Fischer said he has no opinion on the proposed change until he examines the facts.\nTo change the drawspan rules would require a formal change to the Code of Federal Regulations, he said. “It could easily take a year,” he said.\nThere were several tweaks to Lake Washington Ship Canal Bridge regulations from 1984-2003, but none since. Kubly said he will petition the Coast Guard to conduct a pilot project for scheduling pleasure craft.\nThe Montlake Bridge, which also spans the Lake Washington Ship Canal, is operated by the Washington State Department of Transportation — but logically, drawspan changes affecting the three city bridges will affect some Montlake-area travel.\nBesides car traffic, buses get caught in the Ballard Bridge backup, causing delays through the Metro system. The Fremont and University bridges also are popular bicycle corridors.\nThe Fremont Bridge opened some 655 times in June, which equals 22 a day or twice per available daylight hour, Kubly said at his news conference there Tuesday.\n“What we’re saying is, let’s open it one time, and then for the rest of the hour the bridge can operate efficiently.”\nSDOT’s proposal doesn’t include the city-owned lower West Seattle Bridge, the state’s First Avenue South bridge, or King County-owned South Park bridge, all over the Duwamish River.\nThe city previously failed in a request to limit span-opening hours at the West Seattle swing bridge, where high-value industrial ships and barges need to travel when tides are high.\nKubly, who grew up in Texas and managed projects for Chicago’s transportation department, said busy Seattle drawbridges are a new experience, since he arrived last year.\n“I’ve been stuck behind enough bridges that I started asking questions,” he said.\nThe city’s comment email is ShipCanalBridgeOpenings@seattle.gov. Fischer said he would also send a notice to mariners, so to get their comments as well.\nMike Lindblom: 206-515-5631 or mlindblom@seattletimes.com .
