Key features of the bag include:\nballistic nylon shell with 2000 cubic inches of stowage space - 85 percent of space found in standard carry-on electric motor, powered by Lithium batteries with maximum speeds of 8 miles per hour and a range of 6 miles polyurethane composite wheels to ensure smooth transport via motor or pull-behind options two USB ports to charge phones and portable electronic devices. Cushioned storage compartments companion iOS and Android GPS navigation app tracks location of Modobag globally compliant with Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requirements. O'Donnell got the idea for the Modobag while he was racing through an airport with a dance group he supports, Chi-Town's Finest Breakers, when one of the kids jumped on his luggage and asked for a ride. A global traveler who has launched several companies and startups, O'Donnell thought intuitively, \" Why can't we ride our luggage and get where we're going faster and with less stress?\" When he reached his destination O'Donnell called his college buddy Bruner and the concept for Modobag was launched. The project proved a natural fit for Bruner, who has served as a technical director, crew chief and champion of the AMA Superbike Daytona 200.\nO'Donnell and Bruner spent the past twelve months developing a prototype, sourcing component parts, fine-tuning CAD blueprints and testing their design. They assembled a team of accomplished technologists, designers, marketers and road-tested travelers to help them bring the Modobag to market.\n\"Modobag is one of the most innovative and exciting advancements to hit the travel industry since rolling suitcases were introduced in the 1970's,\" said O'Donnell. Prior to the Kickstarter launch, he \"test drove\" the Modobag at heavily-trafficked airports, including O'Hare, JFK and LaGuardia. \"From the first-time traveler to the veteran flight attendant, there was widespread agreement that Modobag will help make travel more functional and fun. Where once travelers had to run through the airport with heavy gear to catch connections they can now get where they need to be on time, on their Modobag.\"\nBruner added that while Modobag was originally conceived for air travel, usability testing revealed the concept transcends travel. \"It helps sales professionals get to appointments. It helps commuters get from home to station to workplace. It helps college students maneuver around campus. And it's perfect for the urban day-tripper who wants to get around town without the hassles of cabs, buses or trains.\"\nModobag's Kickstarter campaign runs through October 2 , followed by a planned retail market launch in early 2016. Special Early Bird pricing for Modobag is available only on Kickstarter beginning at $999 .\nFor more information on the Modobag Kickstarter campaign please click here .\nFor more information on the Modobag, visit www.modobag.com .\nMODOBAG Contact:\nTim Ryan\n312.919.3989\nEmail\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/modobag-launches-kickstarter-campaign-with-first-of-its-kind-motorized-smart--connected-carry-on-300136826.html\nÂ©2015 PR Newswire.
