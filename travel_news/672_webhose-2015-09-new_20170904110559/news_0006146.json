Last updated 06:56, September 9 2015 \nAir NZ 'Safety in Paradise' \nDo tongue-in-cheek safety videos really work? Airlines certainly think so, and they're prepared to spend big to make an impact. READ MORE:* Airlines spruce up their air safety messages \nAir New Zealand recently released a safety video that reworks the Men in Black theme, complete with Rip Torn and Frank the Pug. \nAustralia's own David Campese makes a cameo appearance and the safety instruction briefing is turned into a rap number by a pair of All Blacks – get it? AIR NEW ZEALAND/YouTube \nThe 'Men in Black' have been called upon by Air NZ for their newest safety briefing video. \nThis follows on from similar Air New Zealand safety videos that have taken their cues from Lord of the Rings and \"Safety Safari\", a surf-theme video starring a clutch of male and female professional surfers, world champions among them. All run close to five minutes yet from all reports flyers are sitting up and paying attention. \nIn the US, Delta, United, Virgin America and Southwest Airlines are all taking the starch out of the safety briefing. In mid-2014, a fast talking Southwest Airlines flight attendant turned the safety demo into a standup comedy routine that had the whole cabin in fits. The performance went viral on social media, and anything that allows an airline to show off its human side is rock solid gold. \nA distinctive safety video is also a branding exercise for airlines. Constrained as they are by the economics of airline types, seating and meals, there are not too many ways that an airline can bring a sense of individuality to its product. AIR NEW ZEALAND/YouTube \nAir New Zealand partnered with Sports Illustrated® Swimsuit to celebrate 50 knockout years with their in-flight safety video. \nA radical departure from the same-old same-old safety briefing is one. \nShould airline safety videos be fun? Or are they just annoying?
