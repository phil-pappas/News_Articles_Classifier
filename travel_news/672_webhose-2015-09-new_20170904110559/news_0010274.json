This means approximately US$1.8 billion of direct tourism income,” said Sai Kyaw Ohn. \n\nAccording to MTF figures, international tourist arrivals from January to August this year reached nearly three million, a 50 per cent growth over the same period last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T09:57:21.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
