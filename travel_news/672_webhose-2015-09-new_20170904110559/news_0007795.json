He improved last year's performance of four strikes and drove the tap into the barrel with just two strikes this year, concluding the ceremony with the magic words: \"O'zapft is!\" - \"It's tapped!\" \nThe first mug of beer was then handed to the Bavarian Prime Minister, Horst Seehofer. \nDieter Reiter ended the opening ceremony by wishing everyone a peaceful Oktoberfest. \nOktoberfest.de would like to join Dieter Reiter with this wish and hopes that everybody will have a great time in Munich. \nAbout Munichâ€™s Oktoberfest : \nThe Munich Oktoberfest (Munich Beerfest) is one of the most famous events and the world's largest fair.
