ShaqBLACKJack was developed over a four year period by New Jersey based Dynamic Gaming Systems and NBA Legend Shaquille O'Neal to create an action-packed new gaming experience. Twenty-four separate live \"slot-like\" blackjack games will be linked to a live blackjack game and dealer within a unique basketball themed enclave on the bustling gaming floor at Parx Casino®.\nThe concept of the 'hybrid' game evolved in the mind of Dynamic Gaming's CEO, Charlie Barksdale . \"I wanted to find a way to make a casino game fun for everyone and find a way to bring Shaq's unique brand of humor to the gaming floor. We clicked right away when we started talking about creating this game. We wanted a game that was familiar to everyone, even those with a modest appetite for gaming, but one that would still provide us with opportunities to bring new elements of excitement and rewards to the experience.\"\nFor the world premiere of ShaqBLACKJack, Barksdale and O'Neal explored many options for the perfect gaming operation partner. With its incredible fanfare, over 150,000 people through its doors weekly, and its leadership position in Pennsylvania gaming, Parx Casino® was the ideal launching pad. \"When we had the opportunity to play the game and we personally experienced Shaq's enthusiasm for creating this thrilling new game for our customers, we knew we had to have it. Shaq himself is synonymous with excitement, winning and fun – and that is what we want our guests to think about Parx,\" said Tony Ricci , CEO Parx Casino® .\nThe open-to-the-public event with Shaquille O'Neal will begin at 6:30pm on Sunday, October 4 th in the ShaqBLACKJack area of the casino floor.
