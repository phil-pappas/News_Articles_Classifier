Light-rail service has resumed in St. Paul after protesters shut down the line before Sunday's Minnesota Vikings home opener. Black Lives Matter St. Paul staged a die-in on the Green Line light-rail tracks to protest what they consider excessive force by Metro Transit police officers who arrested a 17-year-old boy with autism there Aug. 31. The boy addressed the crowd. The Star Tribune reports about 100 protesters gathered. Some counter-protesters stood nearby, prompting a confrontation that organizers defused. Metro Transit used buses to replace Green Line trains in that area. The Green Line serves TCF Bank Stadium, where the Vikings hosted Detroit. Metro Transmit says the incident remains under investigation. Metro Transit general manager Brian Lamb says the department is looking at additional training for officers to help them identify autism.
