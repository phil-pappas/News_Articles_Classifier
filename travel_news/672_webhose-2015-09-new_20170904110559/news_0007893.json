Â© by Matera Balloon Festival Why Visit Matera and the Sassi? \nMatera is an interesting city in the Basilicata region of southern Italy known for its picturesque sassi district, a large ravine with cave dwellings and rupestrian churches dug into the soft limestone. The sassi date from prehistoric times and were used as housing until the 1950's when residents, primarily living in poverty stricken conditions, were relocated. \nToday the sassi district is a fascinating sight that can be viewed from above and explored on foot. There are several rupestrian churches open to the public, a reproduction of a typical cave house that you can visit, and refurbished caves made into hotels and restaurants. Because of its similarity to Jerusalem, several movies have been filmed in the sassi district including Mel Gibson's, The Passion of the Christ The sassi district is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Matera has been chosen to be the European Capital of Culture in 2019. \nThe more \"modern\" city, dating from around the 13th century, is also nice and has several interesting churches, museums, big public squares, and a walking area with cafes and restaurants. Where to Stay in Matera \nStaying in one of the cave hotels in the sassi is a unique experience. I stayed at Locanda di San Martino Hotel and Thermae , a former church and cave dwellings made into a nice hotel with an unusual thermal pool. If you want to stay above the sassi, I recommend Albergo Italia ( check ratings and prices on Hipmunk ). When I stayed there many years ago, my room had a fantastic view over the sassi. See Matera Cave Hotels for more choices. Matera Highlights - What to See in Matera Sassi : The sassi district is Matera's top attraction. You'll find view points to look out over the sassi in the upper town near Piazza Vittorio Veneto and Piazza Sedile and stairways near them leading into the sassi. Walk down through the cave houses to the church of San Pietro Caveoso at the bottom of the sassi district. It's also possible to drive to San Pietro. From the church there are good views of the sassi above, the canyon and stream below, and caves across the ravine. Rupestrian Churches : Monks settled in these caves as early as the 7th century. You can visit several of the old cave churches (admission charges apply) but they have fairly limited visiting hours. In some of them you can see interesting frescoes that are centuries old. Cathedral: The 13th century Romanesque cathedral is dedicated to Santa Maria della Bruna. The interior is mainly decorated in 18th century Baroque style but a Byzantine style 14th century fresco of the Last Judgement has been found. It's worth visiting in early July for the Festival of the Madonna Bruna , one of the best festivals I've been to in Italy, that culminating in a spectacular fireworks disply over the sassi. Historic Center : Piazza Vittorio Veneto is a lively and lively square with several churches and cafes and Roman remains. The square's fountain has a colored light display at night. A little way from the square, the church of San Giovanni Battista is a good example of Romanesque style and its interior still retains Romanesque features. Via del Corso is a main shopping street linking the square with Piazza San Francesco and Piazza Sedile, where you can visit the Auditorium del Sedile. Several other interesting churches are scattered around the city. Museums : Museums to visit include a museum of peasant culture, the Domenico Ridola National Museum of archeology, and Palazzo Lanfranchi modern art museum.
