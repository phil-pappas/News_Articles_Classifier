Top Chinese political adviser Yu Zhengsheng headed a 65-member central government delegation to attend the ceremony in Potala Palace Square, Lhasa, and other festivities. The delegation presented Tibetan authorities with a gold-plated plaque bearing an inscription by President Xi Jinping that read: “Enhancing ethnic unity, building a beautiful Tibet.” Mr Yu, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, delivered a keynote speech, vowing that China would continue to crack down on all types of separatist activity. People from all walks of life attended the ceremony in Lhasa Photo: TSE WANG/ FOR CHINA DAILY “Border areas must be well managed to successfully govern the country, and stability in Tibet is paramount to the management of these areas,” Mr Yu said. “Tibet has entered a new stage of sustained stability. Freedom of religious belief has been fully respected and protected. People of all ethnic groups have stood firmly together against separatist attempts, and foiled sabotage by the Dalai Lama group and international hostile forces.” Mr Yu urged local authorities to manage religious affairs according to the law. Tibet is at a crucial stage, building a prosperous society and maintaining stability A member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, Mr Yu also called for improved ethnic solidarity — describing it as a “lifeline” — and enhanced national identity. Pallbar Lhamo, a senior researcher at the Tibetan Academy of Social Sciences, said religion is an important aspect of the Tibetan civilisation, and Mr Yu’s calls will help legalise the management of religion and protect people’s religious beliefs and activities. More important, managing religious affairs by law is an important transformation of method, Pallbar Lhamo said. “In the past, authorities managed religions by policy.” The Tibet autonomous region was founded on Sept 1, 1965, after the establishment of the regional people’s congress, the local legislature, meaning the people of Tibet could elect deputies to the congress.

Tibet is at a crucial stage in completing the building of a moderately prosperous society and maintaining long-term stability, he said. The region has an important role in safeguarding national security and ecosecurity, and maintaining strategic reserves and unique Chinese ethnic culture. It is also an important gateway to South Asia, Mr Yu added. After his speech, more than 6,000 civilians, army and government staff members joined a parade featuring singing, dancing and the release of balloons.
