Sir Freddie Laker was one of the pioneers, assigning DC10 jets to Saudi Arabia to empower Muslims to make their obligatory pilgrimage.\nThe spread of low-cost aviation in the 21st century means that fulfilling the Hajj to Mecca is now feasible for hundreds of millions of people. Flights from the Indian sub-continent, Africa and elsewhere enable millions of Muslims to satisfy the fifth and final pillar of Islam each year. The US State Department describes it as “The largest mass gathering in the world.”\nRead our liveblog of the tragedy here But the surge in the numbers of the faithful to nearly four million a year has not been matched by the ability of the Saudi authorities to manage safely this most holy of rituals.\nThe tragedy outside Mecca is sadly the latest in a series of disasters that have claimed more than 5,000 lives in the past three decades. While the Saudi Ministry of Health has energetically campaigned to reduce the risk of diseases such as MERS and meningitis spreading through among the pilgrims, failures in elementary crowd control constitute more of a danger - despite the strict schedules prescribed for Hajj groups moving between the ritual sites.\nMany more mundane risks prevail. As the number of British Muslims making the Hajj have increased, the business of providing for them has become a highly organised £100m industry.\nA medic tends to one of the people injured in the stampede (AP) Around 50 UK travel agents are approved to provide packages to a total of 25,000 British pilgrims each year.

Hundreds of would-be pilgrims each year lose money to unscrupulous agents in Britain, while in Saudi Arabia some hoteliers have demanded the payment of exorbitant “hidden charges” for the return of passports. The Foreign Office warns of “An increase in the number of reported cases of pickpocketing and other forms of theft in Mecca, particularly in the region of the Grand Mosque.”\nRead more History of disasters during Hajj in last 25 years Shocking video emerges of the aftermath of the stampede Hundreds dead after stampede during Hajj pilgrimage Saudi safety record criticised after death of 700 Hajj pilgrims As families of the dead grieve for their loved ones, the government in Riyadh must explain how yet another Hajj could be engulfed in tragedy - and what it will do to try to prevent any more lives being lost.\nThe Association of British Hujjaj (Pilgrims) UK, based in Birmingham, was set up in 1998 after a fire the previous year killed 340 pilgrims. It warns pilgrims: “Performing Hajj is physically demanding and requires patience and thought to safeguard your and others’ safety,” and urges them to “Be extra careful particularly at the stoning of the Satans at Mina”.\nThat valley, outside Mecca, was where the catastrophe took place - in one of the richest nations on earth.\nMore about: Islam Mecca Religion Saudi Arabia Hajj", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:33:13.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
