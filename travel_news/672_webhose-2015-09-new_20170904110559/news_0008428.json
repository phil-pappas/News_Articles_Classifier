But this year, there is another big event on everyone’s calendar: the second season premiere of Fox’s hit show Empire . Created by Lee Daniels and Danny Strong , it tells the story of hip-hop mogul Lucious Lyon; his ex-wife, Cookie; and their three sons, who are vying for control of his company à la Shakespeare’s King Lear . Between the music, style ( Naomi Campbell has a recurring role), and, perhaps most important, the superb and visceral acting of Taraji P. Henson as the former Mrs. Lyon, the show has attracted a dedicated following of fans. But as integral as the fedoras and furs are to the story of the no-longer incarcerated Cookie, so are the homes she returns to. Paintings by Kehinde Wiley decorate Lucious ’s luxurious gold-tinged home, where everything signifies his success. In anticipation of today’s season two premiere, here are our favorite Empire -inspired products for home. So ask yourself: what would Cookie Lyon want to buy?\nVogue may earn compensation on these sales through affiliate programs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T18:05:25.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
