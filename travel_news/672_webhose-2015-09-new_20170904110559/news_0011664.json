Learn more about them here. \nIf you’re embarking on a highland barge cruise, Scotland’s epic Jacobite Rebellion history is displayed all around you in locations such as Fort William and the Culloden Battlefield. Yet visitors should be aware of some of the myths that have grown up around these events and how even some local sites can be careless with their representations.So, while you’re exploring the historical sites on your cruise, Scotland and its Jacobite Rebellion might be better understood if the following facts are kept in mind.The background \nIn 1688, the King of both England and Scotland, James II, was deposed due to mass public disquiet in both countries - due to his religion (Catholicism) being seen as affecting his policies. At the same time, his niece (Mary) and her Protestant husband (the Dutch William of Orange) had invaded Britain with an army to depose James. The invasion was largely popular and was enthusiastically welcomed in England and, to a lesser extent, in many Protestant parts of the country. The Highlands had more reservations, due partly to Catholicism and partly due to traditional loyalties to the Stuart line of James II.Over the next 60 years, there were two attempts to invade the UK and restore James and his successors to the throne of England and Scotland by deposing William and Mary’s successors. These Jacobite Rebellions were named after the years they took place – the '15' and the '45'. They took root in Scotland due to the above-mentioned legacy of support and growing disquiet over the union with England. \nMyths vs. reality \nBonnie Prince Charlie led the Jacobite Rebellions. There were two rebellions and he was only associated with that of 1745 - he wasn’t alive in 1715. \nThe rebellion(s) was a war between Scotland and England. No, it was a British civil war over which dynasty (and which religion) sat on the now unified throne. \nScotland supported the Jacobites and England opposed them. In fact, in both rebellions, more Scots fought with the government forces against the Jacobites than with them. A little known fact is that some English, mainly Catholics, also supported and fought for the Jacobites south of the border.The Jacobites had mass support in Scotland. This is debatable, but evidence suggests this was not the case. The highlanders, from where most support initially came, were viewed with great mistrust in the central and parts of the country due to their religion, culture and language. Although a large crowd greeted Bonnie Prince Charlie upon his entry into Edinburgh, this may have been enthusiasm for anticipated Scottish independence, and it seems to have evaporated fairly quickly once his intentions to move south became clearer. Many larger Scottish towns remained hostile to both rebellions. \nThe battle of Culloden was between England and Scotland. On a barge cruise, Scotland’s famous battlefield of Culloden is easily reachable, so this is one myth you might hear whilst exploring the site. However, this was nothing to do with Scotland versus England. Over a quarter of the London government’s army was made up of Scots, and there were also Irish, Germans, Austrians and Englishmen. The Jacobite army was largely highland but also had French, Irish and even English contingents. The battle was essentially one of Protestant government against Catholic rebels. It had little to do with nationalism in the sense we know it today. \nThis article merely touches on the fascinating historical events that shaped parts of the country you may pass through on your barge cruise. Scotland has so much more history to immerse in, and cruising these incredible waterways is one of the most relaxing ways in which to do it.
