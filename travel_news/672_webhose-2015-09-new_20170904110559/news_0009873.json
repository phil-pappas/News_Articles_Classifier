Authorities say video shows Margo Grant-Louree picking up the watch and walking away with it Aug. 26. Authorities say she told investigators she got nervous and destroyed the watch after she saw co-workers searching for it. The Brooklyn resident was arraigned Thursday night in Queens on charges of grand larceny and official misconduct. Prosecutors say there is no information available on an attorney who can comment on her behalf. She no longer works for TSA. The case was announced Friday by Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's chief security officer, Thomas Belfiore (behl-fee-OHR'-ee).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T18:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T01:49:31.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
