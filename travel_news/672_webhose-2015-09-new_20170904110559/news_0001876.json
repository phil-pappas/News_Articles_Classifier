The collection, which launched on 15 September, will help raise vital money to keep children safe from danger and demonstrates easyJet’s commitment to the partnership.\nThere are now more than 2 million Syrian children who have been forced to abandon their homes and seek refuge in other countries. Passengers on easyJet flights can donate on board, in any currency, to help Unicef provide life-saving supplies such as clean water and medicine for children in Syria and the surrounding region. easyJet has donated £10,000 to start the collection.\neasyJet and Unicef have also renewed their Change for Good™ partnership which sees the airline raise money through its fundraising initiatives. The renewal ensures that Unicef will become easyJet’s official partner for another three years until June 2018. The overall focus of the partnership will continue to be the global eradication of polio, as well as supporting when an emergency strikes, like the current crisis.\nSince the partnership began in July 2012, the airline has raised over £5 million, helping Unicef provide vaccines to keep children safe from deadly diseases such as polio, and provide life-saving aid in emergencies.\nOver the last three years the partnership has helped keep over two million children safe from polio, which less than 30 years ago was endemic in 125 countries, now it’s endemic in just three. There is still more to do; globally more than 100 million children under five years old are under-immunized and at risk from polio but eradicating it entirely within this generation remains a real possibility and a key goal for UNICEF and easyJet.\nCarolyn McCall, Chief Executive Officer, easyJet, said:\n“The plight of Syrian refugees has affected all of us and in response to requests from our crew we are running a special on board collection to support Unicef’s efforts to care for the children affected by this crisis. We hope our support and the generosity of our passengers will make a difference.\n“We are also proud to announce today the renewal of our partnership with Unicef. ‎\n“Over the past three years our passengers and our people have raised over £5m to support Unicef in making a real difference to the lives of millions of children around the world.\n“We would like to thank our 68 million passengers and staff who travel with us each year who have given so generously to our Change for Good™ partnership. We are looking forward to furthering our achievements with Unicef over the next three years with a particular focus on the global fight to eradicate polio.”\nDavid Bull, Executive Director of Unicef UK, said:\n“We’re extremely grateful to the support that easyJet continues to provide to Unicef both through our on-going partnership, which raises funds for polio and in emergency situations. This support is vital for helping children like those currently affected by the humanitarian emergency in Syria.\n“Our partnership with easyJet has already achieved so much in the past three years, helping us to purchase 5.3 million vaccines for children and keep 2 million children safe from polio as well as provide support for emergencies in Nepal and the Syria region.\n“We’re very proud to be renewing our contract for another three years with easyJet and continue to make a real difference to the lives of children.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T22:22:21.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
