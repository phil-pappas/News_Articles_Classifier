Dotted around the ships are half a dozen other eating places, where you can opt to for main meals as well as find snacks, fresh fruit, salads and ice creams. You could eat beneath a shady awning high on deck with nothing but ocean around you, or you could put on your glam gear and dine amidst soft lights and crisp table linen in one of the adult-only restaurants.

Dine underwater (almost) in the Coral Reef Restaurant where tables nestle next to huge windows looking into a coral reef aquarium teeming with turtles, rays and sharks. Children will love T-REX for dinosaur-themed dining, surrounded by prehistoric creatures. The fun and frolics continue even at simple cafés and snack bars.
