Mr Bemba followed the session intensely, nodding and tapping his finger as Ms Bensouda spoke.\nHe is accused of conspiring with former trial lawyer Aime Kilolo Musamba, Jean-Jacques Mangenda Kabongo, another member of his legal team, Fidele Babala Wandu, a politician and close associate, and witness Narcisse Arido to coach witnesses or offer payment for favourable testimony.\nIn his first trial, he is accused of orchestrating atrocities against civilians in 2002, when soldiers for his Movement for the Liberation of Congo militia intervened in neighbouring Central African Republic.\nIn court, prosecutors played a tape of Mr Musamba apparently instructing a witness to avoid saying that Mr Bemba had direct control over the militia. In written filings, prosecutors cited witness accounts in which Mr Musamba discussed giving cash sums of about €50 to witnesses and hiding the matter from Mr Bemba’s other lawyers.\n\"This isn’t corruption,\" Mr Musamba told one witness, according to prosecutors. \"Just a present from Mr Bemba because you agreed to testify in his favour.\"\nThe defendants could face up to five years in prison and an unlimited fine if convicted.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:31:28.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
