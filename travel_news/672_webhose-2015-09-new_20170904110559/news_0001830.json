Yep this time I packed at the last moment, some would say, a cardinal sin. To be fair, there wasnt much to pack. Just a bike which Ill hook up with a loaned bike rack. Ideal things to do before a strenuous activity (running/cycling): load up carbs on the previous night and have a good sleep of 7 hours. I did neither. Friday was Jam packed with deadlines and wed planned to leave early so no scope of a 7 hr sleep. The plan was to leave NCR by 4 AM. We left at 6 AM. I read somewhere, planning is good, plans are useless. Oops I forgot to mention where I am headed. A quick plan was hitched to explore Sigri , a quaint little hamlet some 20 odd Km from Nainital, over the weekend. And I had planned to bike up from Kaladhungi to Sigri. This is what was in store for me The 6 member group included me, Abhimanyu + his better half and kid, Surojeet + his wife and Simon. Before I had bought my bike, I had spoken earlier to a cyclist friend of mine and she said, climbing is all in the mind. Not sure if I understood at that point in time. Now I do. By 6 AM, everyone was comfortably packed inside the car and we were set to go. The journey was not eventful, but was a bit long. In no time we had reached Moradabad. Time for a pit stop. It was a bit hot. I was hoping that its cooler in the hills. Very difficult to climb up with the sun blazing down on you. The stretch from Moradabad - Rampur - Rudrapur is like driving on the moon . So we decided to go by Kashipur  Bazpur  Kaladhungi route. Even this one has some bad sections in between. But overall the route is in a good condition. In no time we reached Bazpur. Its from here that the fun starts. As you move out of the city, the forest grows denser. And more importantly cooler. I was hoping to see some wildlife instead got to see monkeys and langur. The road through the forest is a dream. Just one turn and we had crossed Kaladhungi. I didnt realize it until we were ~ 1km up the hill. Then we found a spot for me to alight and dress up. Yep I had to change to my cycling clothing. Cant bike in loose shorts and tee. A small photo session and I was off. I am no Chris Froome, started panting after few pedals. So much for Stamina. The first pit stop was under 100 mts. Had a sip of water and calmed my nerves. Remember its all in the mind . One bad thing had happened. We had zoomed across Kaladhungi, so I didnt get a chance to buy energy supplies (chocolates)and water. Thankfully I had kept few fruits in my bag and my friends loaned me a bottle of water. Surprisingly after the first pit stop I was able to climb much more easily. It was hard, but I was managing. Maybe it was the water or maybe the greenery all around me. The time take for 1st KM was ~ 6 mins.  Wow I can climb quick. At this rate I'll be in Sigri in 4 Hr to 4.5 Hrs max!  Plans and more plans. I wont say a word. You already know what happened. The sun was shining, and I was sweating profusely and panting heavily. The road is really steep. Was thankful that my GT has enough low gears. But I needed more. I was guzzling water. In no time had I exhausted the 1 ltr supply. Suddenly it went all dark and misty. I know what that means, rains. Thats the last thing I needed. So I pedaled harder to reach a place where I can take shelter. Luckily found one nearby. The KMVN resort at Ghatgar. Drank and filled water. And it started raining. Small drops. I rushed into a makeshift thatch hut. Changed into my rain jacket and took opportunity to gobble down an apple. It rained hard for ~ 30 mins and then changed into a drizzle. I went out and thought Ok lets go. Crossed some steep bends and once I was out of range of any habitation it started pouring cats and dogs. No place to hide, I trudged along. Must have continued like this for ~ 1km then I saw a dhaba. Stopped there. My arrival created a sort of mini excitement amongst the occupants. Then usual questions: Where are you riding from? How much does the bike costs? Are you alone? For a while I was the center of attraction until I slunk away into a corner. I was feeling a bit low energy so used this forced stop to replenish myself. A cup of tea with butter toast. This was enough for me. Also, bought some chocolates. It was almost an hour before it finally stopped raining. This rain had costed me a good 2 hours. Before starting out the dhaba wala said that the road is good till Khurpatal, after that I'll get steep gradient. I was like WTF isnt this steep already ? Anyways, off I go. Took the opportunity to click photos on every stop that I had. Some of them came good and others rubbish. I am attributing that to the fatigue. :wink: The road had less traffic so most of the times I was alone. I hate to admit it, but the untimely rain had its own advantages. I got to see a waterfall. Mr. fog too made an entry every now and then. Whenever I passed through habitations, the people gave me strange amused looks  Here comes another crazy one . But the children were always happy, waving and shouting. I have to mention this, one thing that always surprises me is the power of appreciation. A mere Thumbs up, from a complete stranger when you are trudging up an incline, acts like a adrenaline shot. Also noticed, its the Truck drivers who'll appreciate you the most. Maybe coz they know what it takes to haul something uphill. Bikers are almost neutral. Some will appreciate and some wont. But theyll maintain a safe distance. But the worst are car walas. Theyll honk incessantly and zip close by. Forget an iota of appreciation, be thankful that they didnt mow you down . Honestly, I really don't know what's it with cars and bikes. Some sort of a sibling rivalry maybe, IDK. It's as if a car would automatically veer towards a bicycle. A funny thing happened. Some guys were tripling on a motorbike. I was moving slowly on an incline so they come close and say enjoying it bhaiya. I just nodded and smiled, was too occupied with the climb to pay attention to these punks. Not so soon afterwards, they were stuck on a steep gradient. Here comes my chance ....I crossed them and hit back, Cant cross this even on a motorcycle!! and used my low gears and climbed that quite effortlessly. Turning back, the look on their faces was priceless.  Revenge of the fallen  Just made my day. Kept trudging along and somehow managed to reach Khupatal. A pit stop. Ate chocolates and fruits, drank water. And most importantly, stretched . Also, called up my friends and told them of my position and gave an ETA.
