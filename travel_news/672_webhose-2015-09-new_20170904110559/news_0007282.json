Italy punished for falling over the ball and Michalak extends his side's lead to nine points. Les Bleus not at full throttle yet but the scorebroad looking healthy enough for them. 20:31 24min France try a series of audacious counter attacks from deep and while their efforts don't actually get them very far for very long, you have to applaud the intent. It's a game waiting to spark into life at the moment... Italy are having a mare with the penalties. Would be in real trouble if Michalak's kicking was accurate #FRAvITA — Lucy Douglas (@lucydougtweets) September 19, 2015 20:28 22min Bad news for Italy is Masi reportedly done his Achilles... 20:24 19min Penalty missed! France win a penalty at scrum time and they seem to have the initial edge up front. That will not please the Italian front row one little bit. Michalak though is off target with the resulting penalty, hitting the woodwork for a second time. In the palaver, Italian centre Andrea Masi has left the field after receiving lengthy treatment. Hope he's okay. #FRAvITA — Rugby World (@Rugbyworldmag) September 19, 2015 20:20 16min Italy coming back into this in terms of territory but need points on the board. Their latest foray into the enemy 22 h9owever comes to an end when they're penalised for sealing off. 20:14 10min France penalty! After all the kerfuffle, Joubert brings them back for an Italian offisde and Michalak adds three more points for France. 20:12 8min More TMO controversy Dumoulin nearly scorches through but is dragged down short. France recycle, Picamoles' final pass comes off an Italian rather than being knocked on and Nakaitaci pounces on the loose ball. The TMO is called into action and he quickly deems that a legitimate try. UNTIL...a replay on the big screen attracts the attention of referee Craig Joubert who spys a knock on by Nakaitaci and it's chalked off. Deja vu... 20:09 6min France penalty! Michalak gets a second chance and makes no mistake this time. Les Bleus draw first blood. 20:07 4 min Penalty miss Michalak misses with the attempted three pointer, his effort brushing off the outside of the upright. All square at HQ. 20:05 2min Early charge for Bastareaud brings a ripple of excitement from the crowd but Italy hold firm and then France are pinged for an accidental offside. First scrum follows and Castrogiovanni comes off worse and concedes the penalty. 20:03 1min Should just mention France playing in red shirts tonight, white shorts. Odd, very odd indeed... 20:03 On your marks, get set, go... Italy kick off and the final game of what has been a cracking day's World Cup action has begun. Can Les Bleus and the Azurri serve up anything like the entertainment we've already had? We're ready! #RugbyWorldCup #FRAvITA pic.twitter.com/TnlII4PL1r — Valerio (@valeri0) September 19, 2015 19:57 Two teams out... ...on the pitch, anthems to follow and we're a couple of minutes away from the kick-off. 19:56 Pressure on Saint Andre... 19:53 Today's two teams are... France: Scott Spedding; Yohan Huget, Mathieu Bastareaud, Alexandre Dumoulin, Noa Nakaitaci; Frederic Michalak, Sebastien Tillous-Borde; Eddy Ben Arous, Guilhem Guirado, Rabah Slimani, Pascal Pape, Yoann Maestri, Thierry Dusautoir (captain), Damien Chouly, Louis Picamoles. Replacements: Benjamin Kayser, Vincent Debaty, Nicolas Mas, Bernard Le Roux, Alexandre Flanquart, Morgan Parra, Remi Tales, Gael Fickou. Italy: Luke McClean; Leonardo Sarto, Michele Campagnaro, Andrea Masi, Giovanbattista Venditti; Tommaso Allan, Edoardo Allan; Matias Aguero, Leonardo Ghiraldini (captain), Martin Castrogiovanni, Quintin Geldenhuys, Josh Furno, Alessandro Zanni, Francesco Minto, Samuela Vunisa. Replacements: Andrea Manici, Michele Rizzo, Lorenzo Cittadini, Valerio Bernabo, Simone Favaro, Guglielmo Palazzani, Carlo Canna, Enrico Bacchin. Two of the best anthems coming up #FRAvITA — Payney (@MrPayney) September 19, 2015 19:49 New selections There are a total of four changes to the Auzzurri XV which faced Wales in their final warm-up match with Vunisa, centre Michele Campagnaro, Aguero and Luke McClean all drafted into the team. 19:42 Record breakers Italy set a new tournament record today in naming a front row of loose-head Matias Aguero, Ghiraldini and tight-head prop Martin Castrogiovanni. Between them the trio have 227 caps, making them the most experienced front row in World Cup history. The previous record was the 215 caps shared by Gurthro Steenkamp, John Smit and CJ van der Linde when they started for the Springboks against Namibia in 2011. 19:39 Skipper sidelined The band news for the Italians is skipper Sergio Parisse is ruled out with a calf problem. Hooker Leonardo Ghiraldini assumes the captaincy while Samuela Vunisa covers at number eight. 19:35 Losing sequence Brunel did mastermind the Azzurri’s 23-18 victory over Les Bleus in Rome two years ago but with just one win in their last 10 Tests, the Italians are seriously short of confidence as they bid to reach the knockout stages of the tournament for the first time in their history. 19:32 Brunel's farewell The World Cup is Jacques Brunel’s swansong as Italy head coach after taking the job in 2012 and even taking into consideration the resources at his disposal, his reign has not been resounding success with just nine victories in his 41 games at the helm to date. 19:27 The mercurial fly-half France reached the final of the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand but lock Pascal Pape and skipper Thierry Dusautoir are the only survivors in today’s starting XV from the side beaten by the All Blacks four years ago. Nicolas Mas and Morgan Parra also started in that final but are named among the substitutes today. Fly-half Frederic Michalak returns for this third World Cup tournament after missing 2011 and needs 22 points to beat Thierry Lacroix's French tournament record of 124. 19:22 Maestri returns The French side for this evening’s showdown features two changes from the XV which narrowly beat Scotland in Paris earlier this month. Those changes see second row Yoann Maestri return to the engine room in place of Alexandre Flanquart while centre Alexandre Dumoulin is named in the midfield alongside Mathieu Bastareaud at the expense of Wesley Fofana. 19:18 All change at the top Saint-Andre will be replaced by Guy Noves as head coach after the World Cup regardless of how the side perform and with a meagre record of only 17 wins in 40 Tests since he was appointed, it’s not difficult to deduce why Saint-Andre will be collecting his P45 presently. Decent little view for the #FRAvITA game pic.twitter.com/vUDOMhwqOC — cox (@marcuscoxxx) September 19, 2015 . @federugby 's Tommy Allan is getting his kicking practise in early ahead of #FRAvITA at Twickenham later on... https://t.co/giTvDjt16M — Rugby World Cup (@rugbyworldcup) September 19, 2015 19:10 Mediocre form It’s not been a particularly more positive story for Les Bleus on the pitch lately either. Their warm-up victory over England in Paris last month was certainly a boost but in the 19 Tests France have played since the start of 2014, Philippe Saint Andre’s side have registered just nine victories. 19:07 Sleepless nights Chaos is invariably the default position for French rugby when a World Cup approaches and as usual all does not appear peachy in the Gallic camp with reports that the players have been complaining about rowdy wedding guests at their hotel in Croydon disrupting their beauty sleep. 19:05 Fans descend on Twickenham 19:02 Confidence low The French have won 33 of those 36 previous encounters but Italy have emerged triumphant from two of the last five fixtures and with both sides in far from scintillating form of late, the points are well and truly up for grabs in London this evening. 19:00 One hour to kick-off... Welcome to our live coverage of the final of today’s trio of World Cup games as France and Italy do battle in Pool D at Twickenham, the 37th time Les Bleus and the Azzurri have met since the two sides first made each other’s acquaintance at the Parc des Princes back in 1937. You may still be catching your breath after the unbelievable drama which has just unfolded between Japan and the Springboks in Brighton but stick with us, this could be another cracker... 15:00 Welcome Hello everybody and welcome to our live blog from the final match of the day, the meeting between France and Italy at Twickenham. Iain will be here from around 7pm to bring you all of the build-up, but before it starts, have a read of our preview below... Samuela Vunisa will draw World Cup inspiration from replacing \"hero\" and injured Italy captain Sergio Parisse for Saturday's Twickenham clash with France. Saracens No 8 Vunisa has branded his battle with France counterpart Louis Picamoles \"David versus Goliath\", but the 120kg Fiji-born loose forward is no shrinking violet. Italy's talismanic loose forward Parisse will miss the Azzurri's Pool D opener after failing to recover in time from a calf haematoma. Vunisa vowed not to try to emulate Parisse's lynchpin style, instead aiming to impose his bullish ball-carrying on Les Bleus. \"Replacing a hero in the team is a really humbling moment,\" said Vunisa. \"For me Sergio has really helped me when I first arrived, he's always been there in my first few games. \"I went and worked with him and talked with him and the only thing he says is that we are two different players. \"I am big and scary, he is more of a leader and his presence is always felt. \"We are two different players offering something different. As an islander I am known as a ball-carrier. \"It is always good to have go-forward so the backs can do their show and have their dance. \"For me to contribute to the team, I put my hands up and do it for the team. \"It will be an honour to play against Picamoles, he's one of the best number eights going around. \"It is a big test for me to go up against him, but it is going to be like David versus Goliath.\" France boss Philippe Saint-Andre will depart his post after the World Cup, with Toulouse stalwart Guy Noves waiting in the wings. Former Gloucester and Sale boss Saint-Andre admitted everything since 2011 has been geared towards this tournament. \"I have been waiting for this for four years and we must arrive with a smile on our faces,\" said Saint-Andre. \"We are concentrating on our game, our strategy, our precision and our discipline. It's just a game of rugby. \"It is important not to put too much pressure on the players. \"They have to be ready in their heads, their guts and their shoes.\" Telegraphsportpage Follow @telegraphsport", "external_links": ["https://t.co/giTvDjt16M"], "published": "2015-09-20T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T22:38:57.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
