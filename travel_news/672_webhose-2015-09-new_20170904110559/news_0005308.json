Dwyer started at the resort this month (September), seven years after leaving for roles in London and the Middle East, and will form part of a new-look team at the award-winning destination in Murcia, south-east Spain, including director of hotel operations Adrian Padina and director of golf Eduardo Ruiz, who were appointed earlier this year. \nThe Irishman has a wealth of experience in the global hotel industry having worked for a selection of the world’s top hospitality brands including InterContinental and, most recently, Hyatt, and is relishing the chance to work with La Manga Club again. Dwyer said: “La Manga Club has played an integral part in my career and I’m delighted to be returning to one of the world’s most iconic resorts. “It is a place that I know well and have some very fond memories of, and I’m very excited at having the opportunity to play a leading role in its long-term future. “The resort realises the importance of continuing to invest in its facilities and I’m looking forward to working with the rest of the team to continue to deliver the stand-out experience that La Manga Club has been renowned for over the years.” Manuel Fernandez-Delgado, general manager for leisure, travel and tourism at the Murcia Tourism Board, said: “It is essential for the Region of Murcia and, of course, for La Manga Club, which is the flagship of the region in terms of tourism, to have managers with experience and international knowledge like Brendan. I'm sure his return will bring a great number of benefits to both the resort and the region.” Set over 1,400 acres in an area three times the size of Monaco, La Manga Club has set the standard for sports and lifestyle destination resort since its inception in 1972. Among its recent accolades, the resort was named as Spain’s leading golf complex at the 2014 World Golf Awards and handed the accolade of ‘Best Golf Resort in Spain’ by UK readers of Today’s Golfer magazine for the fourth year running, as well as being named as one of the top five golf resorts in the world at the prestigious 2015 UltraTravel Awards. Featuring three 18-hole golf courses, La Manga Club’s extensive facilities also include a new Leadbetter Golf Academy – the only one in mainland Spain – a 28-court tennis academy, a new High Performance Sports Centre and 2,000m² spa and fitness complex. In addition, there is a five-star hotel, four-star serviced apartments and townhouses and more than 20 bars and restaurants for all to enjoy.
