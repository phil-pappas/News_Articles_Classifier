Rest and relaxation? Gorgeous vistas? How about a view of the cosmos? \nA new study suggests that gazing upon a naturally dark sky that is unpolluted by artificial light plays a significant role in visitors’ enjoyment of national parks. \n“It’s one of those things that we start to notice only when it begins to disappear,” said Bob Manning, who runs the Park Studies Laboratory at the University of Vermont. \nScientists estimate that 99 percent of the planet’s skies are light polluted and that as of 15 years ago, two-thirds of Americans no longer could see the Milky Way from their backyards. \nThe National Park Service’s Natural Sounds and Night Sky Division works to manage both acoustical and dark-night sky environments throughout the park system. \nPark managers, for example, can replace older fixtures that allow light to “leak” with those that focus light down. \nManning’s group also conducted a survey at Acadia National Park in Maine. Park visitors were asked how important a clear view of the stars is to them. \nThe results were published recently in the journal Park Science . \nNearly all of the hundreds of groups surveyed agreed very strongly that seeing the night sky on their visit to Acadia was important to them. \nThe researchers also found that when people reported seeing natural light sources such as the moon, stars, constellations and the Milky Way, it improved their experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T13:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T13:16:01.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
