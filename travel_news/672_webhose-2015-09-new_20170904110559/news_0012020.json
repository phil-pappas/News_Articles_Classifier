The property will be split between a 92-room main hotel on the restaurant-and-shop-lined Avenida Quinta and an oceanfront Beach House a few blocks away. The latter, scheduled to open in January, will have an additional 27 rooms, plus a pool and beach cabanas. Management is positioning the dual configuration as offering the best of both worlds; a high-energy central location with a 30,000-square-foot rooftop featuring a pool, cabanas, restaurant and lounge, and a more tranquil beach alternative with another restaurant, bar and swimming pool, along with activities including stand-up paddleboarding and scuba diving. The two addresses are about five minutes apart by foot. Rooms from $240.\nIn Transit Travel news, deals and tips, written by the editors and reporters of the Travel section.
