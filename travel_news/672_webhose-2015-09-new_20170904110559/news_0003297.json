That’s when they crisscross the country to woo the nation’s top high-school recruits to their programs. During December and January—the big recruiting period—Mr. Bielema and his staff are on the move “pretty much nonstop,” visiting high schools and prospective recruits almost daily. “I always say recruiting is like shaving—if you miss a day, you look like hell,” he says.\nOne day in last year’s recruiting cycle, Mr. Bielema recalls, he and his assistants visited high schools in Missouri, Colorado, Minnesota and New Jersey within a 24-hour period. “When we’re in that true beast mode in December and January, it can get pretty wild,” he says.\nAs the leader of one of college football’s proudest programs, it should come as no surprise that the coach doesn’t travel in coach. During recruiting season, Mr. Bielema has use of the school’s seven-seat Learjet, meaning he doesn’t have to worry about checking his bags.\nENLARGE Coach Bielema travels with a bag for clothes, shoes and toiletries and a backpack that holds the electronic devices he’ll use while flying.

Mr. Bielema’s plan is to travel light, with just two carry-on bags, though he acknowledges that he is “probably a clutter guy” and has a tendency to overpack. He brings an overnight duffel bag for clothes, shoes and toiletries that goes in the overhead bin and a Razorbacks backpack that holds the electronic devices he’ll use while flying.\nBesides his laptop, iPod and two iPhones, Mr. Bielema carries an iPad that his video director loads up with game footage of prospective recruits, allowing him to scout players on film before meeting them in person.\nFinding the right players is only half the job. Once Arkansas identifies a potential recruit, Mr. Bielema’s task is selling the Razorbacks.\nTo that end, he never travels without the ring his team earned for beating the University of Texas, an old rival, in the Texas Bowl to end the 2014 season.\n“It’s a conversation piece and it gives me a chance to brag about our program a little bit,” he says.\nRelated\nWho Has College Football’s Biggest Home-Field Advantage?

When he hits the road, Mr. Bielema will be armed with another flashy accessory to sell recruits on his program: a virtual-reality system.\nArkansas is one of seven college teams working with Strivr, a California-based company that allows athletes to experience in-game situations through its virtual-reality headset.\n“You can be right in the middle of our huddle giving calls as a quarterback, you can sit in our stadium and watch a game, we can even put you in a classroom,” Mr. Bielema says.\nIt isn’t only high schoolers that Mr. Bielema must worry about impressing. Because coaches tend to scour the same handful of locations for recruits, he says he often ends up staying in the same place as 20 or 30 of his contemporaries. Looking your best in the hotel gym is essential.\n“With so many other coaches around, you’ve got to shine a little bit,” Mr. Bielema says.\nMore What’s in Your Bag\nENLARGE Razorback pride.

A constant companion on road trips is a pair of Ugg slippers, a gift from his wife. “When I’m in the hotel, I love to slip into my comfy shoes, a pair of pajama pants and just lounge around,” he says.\nThe slippers aren’t the only item Mr. Bielema takes to remind him of his wife.\nHe also carries a daily planner with one of the first letters she wrote him tucked into the inside cover, along with a handwritten note from his own college coach, University of Iowa legend Hayden Fry.\n“When he retired he wrote me a letter telling me I was going to be a head coach someday,” Mr. Bielema says. “I carry it with me daily.”\nWrite to Jonathan Clegg at jonathan.clegg@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KE551_0908fi_P_20150907150955.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KE551_0908fi_H_20150907150955.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KE550_0908fi_M_20150907150955.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KE551_0908fi_M_20150907150955.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KE550_0908fi_H_20150907150955.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-09T01:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T21:12:44.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
