It's understandable. After all, while the economic climate is improving, it is hardly stable. This means that anyone in employment feels under pressure to prove their worth, to make sure that, come the next round of cutbacks, they've still got a job. And even if you manage to avoid redundancy, it's still not plain sailing; those left behind frequently find themselves having to shoulder extra responsibility because, while staffing numbers may have reduced, invariably the amount of work has not. Just as pertinently, modern technology has facilitated an \"always on\" culture so even when we're not actually at work, we're expected to reply to emails and calls. And while most of the employees of the companies participating in Britain’s Healthiest Company felt that their work culture was good in many respects – for example, 72 per cent agreed that they received encouragement from their manager at work and 79 per cent agreed that they were respected by their colleagues – there were acknowledged issues in the workplace. Percentage of people with unhealthy behaviours More than half (52 per cent) of those questioned said that they were sometimes, often or always under time pressure; nearly a fifth (18 per cent) felt that there was friction or anger between colleagues, with 15 per cent feeling that relationships at work were actually strained. Little wonder that figures from the Office for National Statistics show that in 2013 in the UK, 15.2 million days off were down to mental health problems such as stress, depression and anxiety. It's an issue that garnered a lot of public attention at the end of 2013 when Hector Sants resigned from his senior role at Barclays because of stress and exhaustion. His is a high-profile example of something that could be experienced by people at any level of an organisation, and is why more and more employers are realising that keeping staff healthy is not just about offering them subsidised gym membership. As a result, we are seeing an increasing focus on mental healthcare and companies taking steps to ensure this is part of their well-being package. This may be by including stress-management modules within management training courses and creating an environment in which individuals feel able to tell a manager if they are not coping with their workload or need help. The cost of poor mental health to business is almost £26 billion per year But it may also be through offering flexible working arrangements – as many of Britain’s healthiest companies, including Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson, Sweaty Betty and Old Mutual do – which can help support a better work-life balance. Because, of course, it’s not just work that can be a source of stress. Nearly a quarter (23.3 per cent) of the employees who responded to the Britain’s Healthiest Company questions admitted that they had financial concerns, and about the same number (23 per cent) said that financial problems caused disagreements. This might be why a number of companies now see financial health as being integral to employee health and happiness. Old Mutual offers financial advice, whether it’s regarding pension planning or tax issues, while Microsoft has built retirement planning and financial education directly into their approach to employee health, says Theresa McHenry, senior HR director. \"We’ve been able to offer a wide variety of benefits as part of our integrated well-being strategy,\" she says. \"We design our benefit programmes to incorporate our four well-being pillars: financial, physical, mental and social well-being to support the whole person.\" Dr Keith Klintworth, clinical director of VitalityHealth, believes this sort of holistic approach is important – not just for the individual but for the company, too. \"The Britain’s Healthiest Company data shows that one-third of employees suffer from multiple dimensions of mental well-being concerns, some of which are unrelated to the workplace but that result in productivity losses for the employer nonetheless,\" he says. \"As one of the top three causes of absence this is a significant risk that needs to be carefully managed, particularly given that stress can manifest in physical outcomes that further impact on productivity, such as a lack of sleep. Physical and mental health need to be given equal prominence on the workplace well-being agenda.\" What worries employees The lack of sleep Dr Klintworth refers to was also something that the data picked up, suggesting that even if employees aren't aware of stress, it could nevertheless be having an impact on their lives 28 per cent of respondents got six or fewer hours' sleep a night, while 26 per cent of people admitted to waking up several times in the night at least eight times in the previous month. And while your employer is unlikely to run you a hot bath and make you a cup of cocoa before bed, to help you get a good night's sleep, what many can – and do – do is help you tackle the things that are keeping you awake at night. As with so many things, prevention is better than cure and Britain’s healthiest companies take a variety of approaches to help manage and, when necessary, treat stress. Take Johnson & Johnson, which gives employees access to on-site physiotherapists and massage therapists as part of its stress- management strategy. And Sweaty Betty which, like many companies, has started to offer staff yoga classes. Other companies offer talking therapies to help their employees. Part of Old Mutual’s employee assistance programme includes counselling on almost any topic from housing and debt to relationships, care responsibilities and bereavement, with referrals to relevant healthcare professionals and confidential advice also part of the package. Adidas goes a step further, offering emotional and mental health clinics to all staff plus life coaches and coaches trained in CBT – Cognitive Behavioural Therapy – which teaches individuals how they can manage problems by changing the way they think and behave. Speaking in Parliament last year, Norman Lamb, then UK Minister for Care and Support, said that at least one in four people would experience a mental-health problem at some point in their life and that the average cost of poor mental health to business is just over £1,000 per employee per year, or almost £26 billion across the UK economy. Little wonder that Britain’s healthiest companies make stress and mental health such a priority.
