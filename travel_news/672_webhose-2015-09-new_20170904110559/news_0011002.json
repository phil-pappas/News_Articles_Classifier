(Picture Courtesy: Instagram/ @howfarfromhome) Travel bloggers Stevo Dirnberger and Chanel Cartell who got to travel around the world for a year after quitting their advertising jobs have had to make their fair share of sacrifices to keep the dream alive.\nThey document their travels in the blog How Far From Home by posting photos where they hold up signs that read how far they are in kilometres from their home in Cape Town, South Africa.\nTheir travels are far from the luxurious and relaxing vacation you’d expect. The couple have taken on menial jobs such as scrubbing toilets, cleaning glasses and chopping wood to fund their trips, according to a recent blog post by Cartell.\nThey come by these jobs through a programme called Workaway, in which travellers can work in exchange for food. Apart from the manual labour requirements, the two also have to cut back on food and transport expenses to keep up their travelling goals.\n\"I am not at my fittest, slimmest, or physically healthiest. We eat jam on crackers most days, get roughly five hours of sleep per night, and lug our extremely heavy bags through cobbled streets at 1 a.m., trying to find our accommodation,\" Cartell wrote, adding that that bus travel was not an affordable option because of their tight travel budget.\n how far from home blog travel blog budget travelling cheap travelling Also Read ‘Phoney’ wanderlust ‘Trip’ping on travel!", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/150902/lifestyle-travel/article/nomadic-couple-have-scrub-toilets-fund-their-travels", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://howfarfromhome.com/", "http://d2yhexj5rb8c94.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/travel-bloggers_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://d2yhexj5rb8c94.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/travel-bloggers_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-03T12:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T01:41:59.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
