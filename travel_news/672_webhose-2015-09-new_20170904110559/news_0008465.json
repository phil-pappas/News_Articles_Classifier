Photo: Anne Simons Anne Simons in Chugach National Forest, outside of Seward, Alaska. Wild and wet in Alaska 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nWhy I went: I wanted to see the biggest, most wild state in the U.S. \nDon’t miss: The Kenai Peninsula has spectacular glacier-clad peaks, fjords, wildlife on land and sea, and cute towns. \nDon’t bother: Although the train is scenic and relaxing, driving a rental car is easy, faster and allows for spontaneous exploring. \nCoolest souvenir: Moose boots for my grandson, caribou antler beads for me. \nWorth a splurge: Camp Denali North Face Lodge in the interior of Denali, where private vehicles are not allowed: guided hikes, four-star cuisine, eco-conscious management. \nWish I’d packed: A rain cover for my day pack. It’s a wet state. The lodge provided rain jackets, pants and hiking gaiters — very helpful in the wet tundra. \nOther comments: August was a good time to visit, with colors appearing in the tundra, blueberries everywhere, wildlife actively feeding to prepare for winter, and no mosquitoes.
