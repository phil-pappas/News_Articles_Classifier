The competition is the first senior international equestrian championship awarded to Scotland, with Blair beating bids from German, Polish, Dutch and Belgian venues. Awarded just before the British equestrian triumph at the 2012 Olympics, which put eventing firmly on the map in the UK, the championships give Scotland an opportunity to build on the economic legacies of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and the Ryder Cup golf at Gleneagles last year. The Games have contributed £740m to the Scottish economy over an eight-year period and supported 2,100 jobs, according to the official post-Games report. Games visitors spent £120m last year, while the Ryder Cup attracted 250,000 visitors from 96 countries and added an estimated £100m to the Scottish economy. The European Eventing Championships are expected to draw crowds of about 60,000, and Scotland can build on its heritage in the sport. The Blair Castle International Horse Trials and Country Fair, organised since 1989, welcome more than 40,000 visitors each year, and contribute £4.5m to the Scottish economy. More eventing competitions, with their popular mix of cross-country, showjumping and dressage, are being staged globally, and the Fédération Équestre Internationale (FEI) is noting growth in new markets such as Asia-Pacific. Even so, “eventing is a sport at which Britain excels”, says Peter McNeile, an independent sponsorship consultant. “This makes it a very attractive sponsorship proposition. It is competitive, clean, open to both genders and demonstrates courage and partnership.” Businesses are attracted by fans’ demographic profile, with 52pc of spectators in the affluent A and B groups. Morevoer, 41pc of spectators are aged below 34, according to British Eventing, and 72pc of the fan base are women. Along with Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, and Bramham, West Yorkshire, Blair Castle has the rare capability in the UK of hosting three-star eventing – the second tier of competition. It has staged the FEI Young Rider European Championships already, and event director Alec Lochore believes the European championships will take it to a “new realm of prestige”. Eventing offers an attractive sponsorship proposition. It is competitive, clean, open to both genders and demonstrates courage and partnership That standing, along with a young, wealthy audience, has been recognised by sponsors including luxury brands such as Swiss watchmaker Longines and fashion design house Reem Acra. Both are FEI partners alongside traditional supporters such as US riding boots manufacturer Ariat. For Longines, named sponsor of competitors’ rankings, the affiliation is part of a strategy to showcase its timekeeping technologies and data-handling services while engaging affluent supporters. Juan-Carlos Capelli, Longines vice-president and international marketing head, says: “We are proud of our association with such a skilful sport which illustrates the core values of our brand: elegance, tradition and performance.” However, changes are being discussed to increase eventing’s appeal to new spectators and sponsors. A survey last year by research firm Repucom recommended introducing shorter formats, modernised dress codes and contemporary music. “There’s a young public out there and we need them,” says Frank Kemperman, FEI dressage committee chair. Scotland’s legacy challenge will be to tap into that fresh opportunity without neglecting eventing’s powerful, lucrative connection to the past. Elite competition and the feel-good factor Five broad and dominant legacies or benefits have been noted from staging major sporting events. Elite sport inspires the masses to take up sport and physical activity. Sports mega- events are also economically beneficial, generate a feel-good factor among citizens and allow much needed urban regeneration, while host states benefit by showcasing themselves internationally. It is no longer just ‘advanced capitalist’ states that seek elite sport success and to host sports mega-events. We now have ‘emerging’ states, such as South africa, china and Brazil, and ‘small’ states, such as Qatar, joining the bidding competition – Dr Jonathan Grix Senior lecturer in sport politics and policy, University of Birmingham Read more: • Potential is delivered by a collective approach • Cutting-edge technology moves sport into the digital age • Investment predictions within the sports industry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-07T20:27:51.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
