The milestone follows the introduction of the new activity in summer 2015. \nThe overhauled ship visit programme ensures that agents experience a true taster of life at sea on a cruise holiday. This includes being able to enjoy drinks in a bar of their choice, sample hot tubs and swimming pools, and even tuck into a lunch that features different courses prepared by the award-winning speciality restaurants on-board. The new experiential ship visits focus on agents being able to try out key features of Celebrity Cruises ships as if they were sailing on-board. Agents also enjoy viewings of staterooms across different accommodation categories and free time to wander around the ship at their leisure after an official welcome and introduction to Celebrity Cruises from the sales team. Feedback from travel agents on the new experiential ship visits includes “the best cruise visit I have ever done”, “a very well structured and executed day, very hard to leave the ship!” and “it was a wonderful experience, I would love to do it again.” Claire Stirrup, head of sales UK and Ireland, Celebrity Cruises, explains: “Ensuring that agents get under the skin of what a Celebrity Cruise is all about is really important. Agents who have felt the grass of the Lawn Club under their toes, sipped a martini from an ice-topped bar and tasted the disco shrimp from Qsine understand our brand better and who to sell our cruise holidays to. We only started the experiential agent ship visits quite late into the 2015 season, and we are already planning to increase the number of agents who come on-board in 2016.” Plus, agents have also capitalised on the opportunity to bring their customers on-board for the day and see for themselves the Celebrity Cruises modern luxury experience. Over 1,000 people have joined Celebrity Cruises on a day ship visit as part of an event organised by their travel agent.
