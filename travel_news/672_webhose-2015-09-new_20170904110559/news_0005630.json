What should passengers do in this case? Please refer to following Vietnamairlines tips to mitigate this situation. Baggage from check-in counter to arrival airport has to go through many stages such as security screening, boarding, transferring from the plane to the trucks and from conveyor to passengers. Airport staff is entirely responsible for these stages. Though there are hundreds of cameras with an operation center, the theft and lost items in the suitcases still happens and this makes many passengers extremely worried. \nWhen detecting the outside baggage is intact but inside is missing some items, passengers should immediately report lost and found of Vietnam Airlines at the airport on irregularities of baggage such as requesting to weight baggage again, checking baggage after receiving, declaring the characteristics of lost items... Then, the airline and security agent will make all their effort to solve the problem such as finding or compensating baggage to passengers. \nIn the case of lost baggage, if passengers cannot prove the actual value of the baggage, the airlines (including Vietnamese Airlines ) will adopt a common compensation for passengers. The liability limits of Vietnam Airlines checked baggage is USD 20 per kg or does not exceed USD 400 per passenger (or local currency equivalent) for cabin baggage. In addition, for flights on European route, the compensation of Vietnam Airways for damaged baggage does not exceed 1000SDR/ passenger. In case of both cabin baggage and check baggage of a passenger are damaged for various reasons, a compensation is made according to the actual damage but not exceeding the limits of Vietnam Airline liability for that passenger (SDR 1000 or local currency equivalent) \nHowever, the condition of carriage of the airlines states that for international flights, electronic devices (laptop, camera, camcorder, music player, MP3 players, mobile phone...), fragile and perishable items, money, jewelry, keys, passport, ID, business document, etc. cannot be accepted to carry as checked baggage. \nSo Vietnam Air suggests passengers: \n- Should use hard suitcases with lock rather normal zipper. If want to get something inside the evildoers will have to break the lock, then the suitcase cannot be closed again. \n- If use a normal suitcase, passenger should wrap it. With this way, it will take more time if evildoers want to steal items in his suitcase. \n- For checked baggage, passenger also should wrap and cover the entire the baggage by tape along with his name, address and phone number.
