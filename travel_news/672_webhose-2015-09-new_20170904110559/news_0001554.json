One is moving through the gears as we pull up outside this huge Jacobean former private home that was converted to a hotel in 1978.\nThe live band is already playing Wonderful Tonight; tailcoats have been discarded, inhibitions abandoned; the smoking coterie outside the purpose-built hospitality wing is growing by the minute.\nIt takes a while to get our bearings. This is a resort set in four acres of immaculate gardens, a destination for families, sporty couples and OAPs looking for a treat. There’s a nine-hole golf course, a spa and indoor swimming pool, ornamental canal, tennis court and croquet lawn.\nHeadlam Hall is popular for weddings... so The Inspector checked out what all the fuss is about\nRooms are either stuffy-traditional in the main house or safe-contemporary in one of the annexes. We opt for the former, which turns out to be despairingly incongruous.\nSomehow, the large four-poster doesn’t work with the cramped modern bathroom with cheap fixtures and fittings. Two of the three windows have been permanently sealed by coats of paint and the duvet has long outlived its fluffy days.\nRELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Gear up for the Lakes! Cycling through Cumbria isn't just... Share this article Share But there’s still something heart-warming going on, especially when sitting in the Great Hall before dinner with a great big glass of vino, the grand piano being played in the background. Staff are largely locals who seem to take pride in their jobs.\nThe Inspector wasn't blown away with the crab and avocado starter (file photo)\nDinner is served in the conservatory — an airless space bereft of atmosphere. Our crab and avocado (for me) and smoked salmon mousse (for her) starters taste and look just as they do off the ready-made shelf in Marks & Spencer. But our crusted rack of lamb is delicious.\nWe sleep soundly, but make it in good time for breakfast, where we are told to sit in an arid side room to the airless conservatory. The sun is screaming at us through the window.\n‘I don’t think I can have breakfast here,’ I tell my wife. ‘Don’t be ridiculous,’ she says. ‘Just do something about it.’\nSo I ask a waiter if he can open the nearest window to our table — and he does. Whoosh!\nBut there’s nothing he can do to revive the decimated breakfast buffet — it’s pretty much all gone. Better to clear it away altogether than leave a few dishes of dregs.\nAnd I just don’t get why you should ever have to pay extra for an espresso at breakfast. It’s like asking someone to pay extra for the mash when ordering sausage and mash.\nOur spirits rise as we walk round the garden before leaving. Another wedding group will be here soon; or Rotary Club AGM.\nPLAN YOUR OWN STAY AT HEADLAM HALL IN TEESDALE Headlam Hall, Headlam,\nDarlington, DL2 3HA\n01325 730238,\nheadlamhall.co.uk\nDoubles from £130 B&B\nRead more: Luxury Hotels Darlington | North East Hotel near Durham Barnard Castle & Newton Aycliffe | Headlam Hall Country House Hotel", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1MTUuI1", "http://headlamhall.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-08-29T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:23:59.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
