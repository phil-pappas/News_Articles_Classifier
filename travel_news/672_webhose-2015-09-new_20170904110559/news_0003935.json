Â© Patty O'Hara/Flickr (CC BY-SA) \nQuestion: What Is Rijsttafel? \nAnswer: \nRijsttafel (translation: \"rice table\"), pronounced RICE-taffle, is a medley of dishes from all over the Indonesian islands, and a perfect introduction to \"indisch\" (colonial Indonesian, pronounced \"IN-dees\") cuisine. Order rijsttafel at a restaurant, and you will find the table in front of you covered with a selection of varied dishes, a veritable multi-person buffet. But make no mistake: rijsttafel , despite its Indonesian roots, is not authentically Indonesian ( indonesisch in Dutch). Instead, it is a relic from the period of Dutch colonization over what is now Indonesia (1602-1942), when the Dutch East India Company traded in the natural resources of the so-called Spice Islands. There the rijsttafel was invented, based on the model of the Indonesian feast nasi padang , in order to allow Dutch colonials to sample dishes from Java, Bali, Sumatra and countless other islands; the number of dishes could run to upwards of a hundred at these lavish banquets. Colonials and Indonesian expatriates then introduced the rijsttafel to the Netherlands, where it's been a popular fixture in Indonesian restaurants ever since. \nWhat dishes appear on a rijsttafel ? \nEach rijsttafel is different, as the selection of dishes is up to the chef's discretion. Most rijsttafels have between 12 and 25 dishes and come with white or fried rice ( nasi putih or goreng ), noodles ( bami goreng ), or a combination of these. Some favorite rijsttafel dishes are: Gado gado - cooked vegetable salad slathered with a rich peanut sauce Pisang goreng - tasty banana fritters Sambal goreng tempeh - fried tempeh, or fermented soybean cake, in a dark, savory sauce Sambal telur - hard-boiled eggs marinated in a peppery sauce Sayur lodeh - mixed vegetables in a spicy coconut-milk sauce \nIn addition, there are often sides of atjar tjampoer (Indonesian mixed pickles to cool the palate), serundeng (grated coconut spiked with roasted peanuts), and other sauces and condiments to overwhelm the senses. And don't miss spekkoek , the classic Indonesian spice cake, for dessert! \nWhere can I order rijsttafel in Amsterdam ? \nRijsttafel is available at virtually any Indonesian or \"Indies\" restaurant in Amsterdam, but naturally the quality varies.

One place to start: Amsterdam restaurant Tempo Doeloe (Utrechtsestraat 75) has nabbed a Michelin Bib Gourmand award - not a Michelin star , but the company's accolade for the best affordable restaurants - for its take on Dutch-Indonesian cuisine. \nHow can I make rijsttafel at home? \nFollow these recipes from About's Dutch Food Expert to cook up a DIY rijsttafel at home:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T22:58:32.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
