More travelers[1], higher consumer spending in key areas and strong currency fluctuations have all contributed to this result. For the U.S. in particular, hotel prices rose steadily, with an overall 2% increase paid by worldwide travelers the first half of the year.\nThe HPI is a regular report on hotel prices in major destinations across the world, tracking the movement in prices that people actually paid* for their accommodation and providing valuable insight into the reasons behind these changes. The data is drawn from bookings made on the hundreds of thousands of hotels on the Hotels.com websites worldwide.\nEast Coast Hotspots with Price Drops\nFor the past three years, Hotels.com has reported a steady increase in New York City hotel prices, but this year, the Big Apple is on the decline. For U.S. travelers, prices paid in New York dropped 6% from $261 per night to $245 per night this year. Although New York City is still the domestic destination where U.S. travelers paid the most this year, the decline in price could be attributed to the hotel boom in Manhattan and Queens.\nIf U.S. travelers are looking to go East, Atlantic City, NJ could be worthy of a few nights’ stay. Hotel prices in “America’s Favorite Playground” dropped 3% year-over-year to an average of $147 per night, making this entertainment-meets-beach town optimal for a budget-friendly getaway.\nWestern Cities on the Rise\nGaining in popularity and price are destinations in Washington, Oregon and Arizona. The Grand Canyon area made its debut on the top 50 list of popular U.S. cities for Americans this year, coming in at #45. Hotel prices in the area made a 12% jump, the highest increase of any U.S. destination this year. Yet for those looking to travel to the area to celebrate the 2016 Centennial of the National Park Service, average prices paid were still an affordable $117 per night.\nHotel prices in Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington each increased by 9% this year, rising to $149 and $195 per night, respectively. It’s likely that Portland’s mild winter this year and the success of Travel Portland’s “Portland is Happening Now” campaign at least partially contributed to this rise. As for Seattle, the city saw an increase in travel interest since the recreational sale of marijuana was legalized in July of 2014. The city experienced a 61% increase in hotel searches in the second half of 2014 after the law was in effect.\nAverage Hotel Prices Paid by Americans in the Top 50 Most Popular U.S. Destinations\nCity\nState\nFirst Half 2015\nFirst Half 2014\n% change\nH1 Popularity Ranking\nNew York NY\n$245\n$261\n-6%\n2\nHonolulu HI\n$226\n$215\n5%\n41\nSan Francisco CA\n$217\n$208\n5%\n7\nMiami FL\n$216\n$208\n4%\n15\nBoston MA\n$213\n$201\n6%\n12\nSeattle WA\n$195\n$180\n9%\n19\nNew Orleans LA\n$191\n$179\n7%\n13\nLake Buena Vista FL\n$185\n$178\n4%\nN/A\nChicago IL\n$179\n$165\n9%\n6\nNashville TN\n$178\n$164\n9%\n21\nLos Angeles CA\n$175\n$162\n8%\n5\nWashington DC\n$173\n$164\n5%\n8\nCharleston SC\n$169\n$166\n2%\n44\nFort Lauderdale FL\n$161\n$154\n4%\n24\nAustin TX\n$160\n$155\n3%\n16\nArlington VA\n$158\n$147\n7%\n46\nPhiladelphia PA\n$155\n$151\n3%\n18\nSan Diego CA\n$152\n$145\n5%\n4\nMyrtle Beach SC\n$150\n$145\n3%\n25\nAnaheim CA\n$149\n$143\n4%\n17\nPortland OR\n$149\n$136\n9%\n22\nNewark NJ\n$148\n$148\n0%\n38\nAtlantic City NJ\n$147\n$151\n-3%\n39\nSavannah GA\n$142\n$134\n7%\n40\nDenver CO\n$142\n$131\n8%\n14\nSt. Louis MO\n$140\n$130\n7%\n30\nBaltimore MD\n$140\n$139\n1%\n33\nDallas TX\n$136\n$134\n2%\n20\nIndianapolis IN\n$134\n$128\n5%\n32\nSan Antonio TX\n$131\n$127\n3%\n10\nHouston TX\n$129\n$131\n-1%\n9\nAtlanta GA\n$128\n$122\n5%\n11\nPhoenix AZ\n$125\n$116\n8%\n27\nMemphis TN\n$123\n$117\n5%\n49\nTampa FL\n$123\n$115\n7%\n23\nColumbus OH\n$123\n$117\n5%\n43\nDetroit MI\n$121\n$118\n3%\n28\nCharlotte NC\n$121\n$114\n6%\n26\nKansas City MO\n$119\n$114\n4%\n29\nLas Vegas NV\n$119\n$116\n2%\n1\nGrand Canyon AZ\n$117\n$105\n12%\n45\nSalt Lake City UT\n$113\n$104\n8%\n34\nSacramento CA\n$113\n$105\n7%\n31\nOrlando FL\n$112\n$103\n8%\n3\nRaleigh NC\n$108\n$103\n5%\n36\nOklahoma City OK\n$106\n$106\n0%\n48\nJacksonville FL\n$101\n$96\n6%\n37\nPigeon Forge TN\n$99\n$95\n4%\n47\nAlbuquerque NM\n$91\n$89\n2%\n42\nReno NV\n$85\n$83\n3%\n35\nU.S. Travelers get Bargains Abroad\nThe three most popular international destinations for Americans saw large price drops for the first half of the year. London, which was the #1 most popular international city for Americans, saw a 7% decrease, bringing the nightly price paid down from $271 to $252. Paris and Rome, the next two most popular international cities for Americans each dropped by 16%. The declines may be a result, in part, of currency fluctuations in the area this year.\nKuala Lumpur, Malaysia decreased by 24% this year. With average prices paid of $89 per night, the city was one of the best bargains in Asia. Both Hong Kong and Seoul, Korea saw price drops at 16% and 13% respectively.\nPrice Drops in Popular International Cities for American Travelers\nDestination Country\nFirst Half 2015\nFirst Half 2014\n% variation\nH1 Popularity Ranking\nKuala Lumpur Malaysia $89\n$117\n-24%\nN/A\nIstanbul Turkey $131\n$158\n-17%\n19\nRome Italy $174\n$208\n-16%\n3\nFlorence Italy $188\n$224\n-16%\n15\nParis France $214\n$254\n-16%\n2\nHong Kong Hong Kong $161\n$191\n-16%\n9\nPanama City Panama $99\n$114\n-13%\n32\nCopenhagen Denmark $185\n$213\n-13%\n30\nTel Aviv Israel $181\n$208\n-13%\nN/A\nSeoul South Korea $131\n$150\n-13%\n25\nBarcelona Spain $172\n$197\n-13%\n7\nLondon United Kingdom $252\n$271\n-7%\n1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T02:06:30.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
