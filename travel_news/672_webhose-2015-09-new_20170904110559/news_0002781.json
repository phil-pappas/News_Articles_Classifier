Regis Connoisseurs Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig, the co-founders of fashion house Marchesa. \nThe Marchesa Bridal Capsule Collection for St. Regis Hotels & Resorts draws inspiration from some of the St. Regis brand’s most iconic urban and resort destinations - namely New York, Dubai, Punta Mita and Mumbai. Each dress will range from USD $20,000 - $50,000. Those who purchase one of the bridal gowns will be invited to Marchesa’s atelier for a personal fitting with Chapman and Craig, followed by a stay at the legendary The St. Regis New York. \n“St. Regis has always been a beloved destination for weddings around the world, and we are thrilled to offer brides yet another way to make their day truly beyond expectation,” said Jim Petrus, Global Brand Leader, St. Regis Hotels & Resorts. “Marchesa evokes the same spirit as St. Regis, combining classic elegance with a modern sensibility, and through their designs, Georgina and Keren have beautifully captured the glamour of both iconic New York-born brands.” “Each design evokes the distinct style of its destination with bespoke details that appeal to brides from all parts of the world,” said Chapman. Craig continued, “The common thread of the dresses designed for St. Regis, as with all of the gowns we design, is the desire to make a woman feel her most beautiful. We are excited to offer brides another facet of St. Regis glamour for one of the most special moments of her life.” \nThe Marchesa designers drew inspiration from the customs and culture of each locale so that each dress design connotes a unique sense of place. They then began sketching and draping silhouettes, experimenting with fabrics and thinking about design elements that would resonate with each destination. \nThe Mumbai design features an intricate-engineered, embroidered lace bodice with crystal and pearl embroidery with gold accents. It is a regal dress with traditional Indian beading, which also captures a modern lightness with the pleated tulle skirt overlay atop a Chantilly lace column skirt. The design for New York is much more architectural, with a nod to the 1950s. The gown features a cathedral train with 3D-threadwork embroidery and crystal and pearl beading over silk duchess satin. The Dubai-inspired dress channels the fashion-forward, vibrant city into a gown with a slim silhouette and dramatic long sleeve. It features ornate rose gold threadwork and a silk duchess satin fishtail skirt, fully beaded with clear crystals and pearls. The resort setting of Punta Mita inspired a design that embraces a more relaxed aesthetic in-tune with a beach wedding. The dress features soft 3D-lace floral and threadwork embroidery with flowing tulle. \nThe St. Regis brand’s partnership with Chapman and Craig developed organically after Marchesa showed its bridal collection at The St. Regis New York during New York International Bride Week in October 2014. As genuine brand enthusiasts, the two esteemed designers call St. Regis their home away from home when they travel and entertain around the globe. \nSt. Regis has taken special care to partner with ambassadors who share the brand’s commitment to excellence and speak to the passions of its guests, offering an authentic connection to the St. Regis legacy. Together, with renowned polo player Nacho Figueras and fashion designer Jason Wu, this elite group of St. Regis Connoisseurs further establishes St. Regis as an authority in style and design, philanthropy, and speed and sport - all passions of the St. Regis brand’s global clientele.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T00:26:40.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
