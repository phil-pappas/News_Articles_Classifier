These rehabilitated trails follow ancient pathways that were once traversed by Trinidad and Tobago’s First Peoples. In addition to a walk through the island’s history, the trails project will also offer locals and visitors an extensive range of eco-adventure and leisure experiences including hiking, zip lining, biking, bird watching, sea bathing and nature photography.\nManaged by the Tourism Development Company Limited (TDC), the project is being implemented by the Trinidad and Tobago In-Coming Tour Operators’ Association. The nature trails project is just one of several initiatives being undertaken to improve the quality of Trinidad and Tobago’s tourism product and attract international visitors who crave novel eco-experiences. The dual island nation is ranked as the third most competitive tourism economy in the Caribbean according to the 2015 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T01:36:37.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
