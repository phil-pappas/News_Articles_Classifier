And as if to prove how much worse its bark – or rather spitty snarl, growl and scream – is than its bite, Chomper waddled over to Greg and scrambled up into his lap for a cuddle.\nLet’s do it, I decided, gingerly walking over to Greg as Chomper and chum Pee Wee turned their heads in our direction. I held my breath…\nTasmanian devils are in trouble. The population is being devastated by a facial tumour disease, and experts are fighting hard to prevent the animal’s extinction in the wild.\nPublicity about their plight has boosted interest in Tasmania itself.\nOff the coast of southern Australia, it can be overlooked by international tourists but it is a brilliant destination thanks to stunning landscapes in a great outdoors made for hiking, cycling, sailing and canyoning.\n 2 Next Hollywood's biggest stars, the delights of North Korea and...

But top of the list of must-sees these days is the Sarcophilus harrisii, aka the Tasmanian devil – Tasmania is even shaped a bit like a devil’s head.\nUnder threat: Two of the devils at Bonorong. Wendy Gomersall said: 'Tasmanian devils are in trouble'\nIf you’re not lucky enough to see one in the wild, you’re sure to encounter them at Bonorong, a magnet for all animal-lovers.\nAnd patently no one’s told Chomper and Pee Wee they’re meant to be vicious, ultra-aggressive beasties waiting to rip your arm off at the first opportunity.\nThey did not make a squeak as my niece Holly and I padded into their enclosure. They did, however, exhibit their displeasure by standing on the spot and trembling violently, their plump rumps vibrating and their dark, sticking-up fur making them look like angry little punk rockers.\nWe were almost disappointed not to have been torn to shred. Were they afraid of us? I asked Greg.\nNo, they were reacting to our smell, he said, reaching down just in time to shoo away Chomper who, having taken advantage of my distraction, was making a beeline for my exposed ankle.\nSneaky little devils…\nTRAVEL FACTS A 15-day self-drive holiday to Tasmania including international return flights from the UK to Hobart, car hire, accommodation, some meals and a number of wildlife experiences costs from £2,875pp.\nContact Wildlife & Wilderness ( wildlifewilderness.com , 01625 838225).
