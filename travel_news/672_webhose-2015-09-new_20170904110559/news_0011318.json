A constant companion on all flights is the airberlin magazine, which will be sporting a new look from the 1st September. In collaboration with the publishing house Ink, a magazine concept was developed which invites readers to assume new perspectives — on countries, peoples, and of course the German capital city of Berlin. \n\"Berlin is not for fuddy-duddies. I can't think of another global metropolis which is as hip and trendy as the German capital right now. Berlin is cool, sexy, and bursting with creativity\", says Stefan Pichler, Chief Executive Officer at airberlin. \"Our new in-flight magazine aims to reflect just that. With Ink, we have found a partner who will reinforce the airberlin brand with a new, fresh, and unconventional concept for the on-board magazine, and ensure its commercial success.\" \n“It has been great to bring our award winning creative, advertising sales, digital and editorial teams to create this beautiful new and progressive magazine. airberlin have recently shown that they are tremendously forward thinking and innovative with their brand, and it’s great to be at the heart of that narrative and conversation between passengers and the airline,” says Michael Keating, Chief Executive Officer of Ink. \nIn the month leading up to the 25th anniversary of the Day of German Unity, the first cover story of the new airberlin magazine will tell us about the lives of 25 young people born in the year of German reunification, and who currently live in Berlin. At 25 years of age, they are a cross-section of today's progressive, modern, and global society. In new sections such as \"The Kiez\" (a very Berlin word for \"neighbourhood\"), \"The Guy\", and \"The Celebrity\", airberlin's flight guests will get the best tips for their next trip. airberlin crew members will also be presenting their favourite destinations, beginning with flight attendant Julia Haberland in the September issue. \nThe bilingual magazine (German/English) is published each month and can be found in seat pockets on all airberlin flights. The new airberlin magazine will also be available online as an e-paper on the 1st of each month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T18:48:53.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
