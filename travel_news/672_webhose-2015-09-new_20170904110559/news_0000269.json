They are missing out.\nYes, Delhi is chaotic and overwhelming, but it’s also wonderfully rewarding. And now’s the time to go. The city is cooling down after a summer that saw temperatures surge to 44c — and the introduction of new online visas has made India more accessible than ever.\nHumayun's Tomb in Delhi is a beautiful spot that should not be missed out on\nOLD SPICE\nOriginally a walled city built in the 17th century by Emperor Shah Jahan, historic Old Delhi remains a lively enclave of mosques, forts, markets and back streets, where the hot air sizzles with frying samosas. Chandni Chowk is like London’s Oxford Street on hallucinogenic drugs. At the eastern end stands the imposing Red Fort, a Mughal masterpiece built from sandstone in the mid 1600s.\nSERENE SCENE\nNew Delhi, by comparison, is peaceful, with tree-lined boulevards plotted a century ago by the British Raj. Stand under the Arc de Triomphe-inspired India Gate, built to honour those who fell in World War I, and visit Gandhi Smriti, the house-turned-museum where the ‘Father of India’ was assassinated in 1948.\nRELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Gear up for the Lakes!

Elsewhere, the National Gallery of Modern Art ( ngmaindia.gov.in ) is housed in a former palace.\nON YER BIKE\nTake to the streets with Delhi ByCycle ( delhibycycle.com ). Guided cycling tours at dawn (when the city is quieter) reveal the sights while dodging honking cars, buses, rickshaws, goats and stray dogs. Thrilling and a little terrifying.\nA visit to Delhi gives a fantastic opportunity to taste some real tandoori dishes\nDELHI BELLY\nNo, not that Delhi belly. Delhi is one of India’s culinary hotspots. Don’t miss the aromatic black lentil dhal, cooked for more than 18 hours, at Bukhara ( itchotels.in ) in New Delhi. Presidents Obama and Clinton have both eaten there.\nThe adventurous should head to Karim’s ( karimhoteldelhi.com ), one of the city’s oldest restaurants; a no-frills institution famed for its tandooris and goat brain curry.\nBED DOWN\nA hotel fit for a maharaja, The Oberoi New Delhi ( oberoihotels.com ) offers plush rooms with pillow menus, a pool and heavenly spa (try the Indian foot massage). Ask for an east-facing room for views of Humayun’s Tomb, the 16th-century, Persian-style complex that inspired the Taj Mahal in Agra.\nTRAVEL FACTS Cox and Kings (020 7873 5000 coxandkings.co.uk ) has four nights’ B&B in a deluxe room at The Oberoi, New Delhi, from £1,060 pp, with flights and private transfers.\nRead more: Cox & Kings - Luxury Holidays and Tailor-made Tours Luxury Business and Leisure Hotels in India, Indonesia, Mauritius, Egypt and Saudi Arabia - Oberoi Hotels and Resorts Indian Restaurants, Indian Food, Indian Cusines, Indian Recipes, Indian Dishes, Indian Hotel 5 Star luxury hotels | Business hotels in India - ITC Hotels DelhiByCycle - A lifetime experience!
