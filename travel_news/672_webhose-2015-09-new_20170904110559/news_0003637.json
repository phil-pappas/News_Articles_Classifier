For a few manufacturers, the feature is becoming a standard fitment in some markets, driven primarily by the need to meet emissions standards. The latest systems are starting to implement some of the features that were first developed for full hybrid vehicles, such as regenerative braking and electric power assistance. OEMs must get the most efficiency benefits from the smallest cost increment, and some have concluded that the current 12V electrical system is becoming an inhibitor due to its practical power limit.\nGrowth in light duty vehicle 48V system sales through the end of the decade will occur first in Western Europe , mainly because this region is the most aggressive in implementing fuel economy and emissions regulations. North America will follow, as will some countries in Asia Pacific . Meanwhile, German vehicle manufacturers have collaborated to develop a 48V standard that builds a foundation for more capable stop-start systems. According to Navigant Research, total global sales for light duty vehicles with 48V electrical subsystems are expected to reach just over 7 million by 2024.\nThis Navigant Research report analyzes the benefits and challenges of introducing 48V electrical subsystems into vehicles. The study examines the reasons to move to a higher voltage for stop-start and other component systems, why 48V is the right level, and the options for energy storage. A global forecast is provided for light-duty vehicle sales that will feature 48V systems by region through 2024. The report also analyzes the market drivers and barriers for 48V systems and profiles the key market players that are developing and introducing this technology.\nKey Questions Addressed:\nWhy is 48V being considered for stop-start vehicles (SSVs)?\nWhat are the additional benefits available from 48V over 12V stop-start systems?\nHow do simple SSVs differ from micro hybrid and mild hybrid vehicles?\nWhich companies are driving the adoption of 48V electrical systems?\nWhat configurations of 48V systems can be expected in the future?\nHow quickly will the 48V market grow and what effect will this growth have on SSV markets?\nWhat are coasting and sailing and how are these relevant to 48V systems and fuel efficiency?\nWho needs this report?\nVehicle manufacturers\nVehicle component suppliers\nElectronics suppliers\nBattery manufacturers\nUltracapacitor manufacturers\nFleet managers\nGovernment agencies\nInvestor community\nRead the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p02905377-summary/view-report.html\nAbout Reportlinker\nReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.
