That means Morales, a conservative, will face either Torres or Baldizón in a runoff on Oct. 25. But with just 5,523 votes separating the latter two, the race remains too close to call, officials said.\nSee: In Guatemala’s capital, little enthusiasm for country’s next president\nA ‘friend’ told him Baldizón said his campaign has requested the results sheets from all 2,700 polling stations.\n“A friend said to me, ‘They’re stealing the election from us,'” he said.\nElectoral tribunal chief Julio Solorzano dismissed the allegation.\n“If they believe there’s fraud, let them prove it,” he told journalists.\nElection officials have said they will finish reviewing the ballot count Friday and announce the results at a press conference.\nFormer President Pérez Molina, meanwhile, appealed a judge’s ruling to jail him pending trial. His lawyer said jailing the retired general violated his rights and was unnecessary because he did not pose a flight risk.\nProsecutors and investigators from a U.N. commission tasked with fighting high-level graft in the Central American country accuse Pérez Molina of orchestrating a scheme in which businesses paid bribes to corrupt officials in exchange for illegal discounts on their customs duty.\nThe scheme collected $3.8 million in bribes between May 2014 and April 2015, including $800,000 each to Pérez Molina and jailed ex-Vice President Roxana Baldetti, prosecutors allege.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T15:50:50.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
