However these organisations are completely unregulated and your car could be parked anywhere while you are away, often in an area which has no safety or security measures in place. The airport was first awarded the Park Mark status four years ago and maintaining this highly respected seal of approval from the Police is very important to us and our passengers,” he added.\nThe Park Mark Safer Parking Scheme is aimed at reducing both crime, and the fear of crime, in parking facilities. It is managed for the Association of Chief Police Officers by the British Parking Association and is supported by the Home Office. The award is given to parking facilities that have achieved the requirements of a risk assessment conducted by the Police and includes quality management, appropriate lighting, effective surveillance and a clean environment.\nThere are two car parks at Bournemouth Airport both within easy walking distance of the terminal building. Passengers could save up to 70% compared to the turn-up parking tariff if they pre-book online (terms & conditions apply, see website for details).\nSource:- Bournemouth Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T18:37:58.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
