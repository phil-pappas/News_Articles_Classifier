There has been significant investment in furniture, flooring, serving areas and decoration across all three lounges in Guernsey and Jersey Airports for the benefit of our passengers. The dedicated inter-island lounge at Gate 6 in Jersey Airport has seen a complete transformation ensuring all Blue Islands passengers enjoy a truly enhanced Blue Islands experience in each of our lounges. When we launched Blue Islands in 2006, we carried a modest 63,000 passengers per year. Now with over 330,000 passengers choosing to fly Blue Islands each year, we’re looking forward to welcoming more people than ever through our new lounges.”\nIn addition to free WiFi, passengers can choose from a selection of complimentary herbal and fruit teas, fresh coffee, juices and a selection of biscuits together with local newspapers. The lounges now feature artwork from local photographers, currently Steve Wellum in Jersey and Chris George in Guernsey.\nMr Veron added “Airports can be busy so we wanted create an environment where our passengers can relax with a drink and catch up on emails or the latest local news before a flight.”\nThe new lounges in Jersey Airport and Guernsey Airport are now open for all Blue Islands passengers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T09:06:48.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
