But if this occasion was a showcase for the European Commission president to lay down a vision for how to fix the continent’s ills, from the recent migrant crisis to the still-wobbly euro, it did not inspire confidence. Mr Juncker spoke for 90 minutes – an absurdly long time – prescribing “more Europe” as the panacea for everything while being heckled from the upper slopes of the chamber by an assortment of anti-Federalist MEPs, including some from our own Ukip. As a spectacle, it was risible – but that cannot distract from the fact that Mr Juncker is right about one thing: Europe’s challenges have now taken on an existential quality. Whether it is keeping Greece in the euro or persuading Hungary to treat migrants with dignity, the difficulties of yoking together 28 member states with such divergent cultural backgrounds and economic strengths can no longer be concealed. The strategy of muddling through – that time-honoured European method of managing national differences that has stored up the wealth of difficulties on display this year – is no longer enough. Two competing centripetal and centrifugal forces are now visibly at work in Europe and Mr Juncker – along with Germany, France and the core of Old Europe – are determined that forces of ever closer union will win out. Indeed Mr Juncker, to judge by his apocalyptic video-trailer for his speech, sees these crises as the crucible out which a new, stronger – united – Europe must grow. In practice when it comes to the economic architecture of the euro post-Greek crisis, that is already happening despite German misgivings, and now – backed by newfound German leadership from Angela Merkel – the same is occurring on the migrant crisis. \"It has to be done in a compulsory way” Mr Juncker said of his enhanced plan for a pan-European asylum policy with resettlement quotas – no if’s, no buts. European countries must take in refugees, the president of the European Commission said. http://t.co/XWCgM4cSXU pic.twitter.com/tmW8K0PQo2 — New York Times World (@nytimesworld) September 9, 2015 And while Mr Juncker is handing out fines for non-compliance, he also wants to create a “fully operational border and coast guard system” which sounds awfully like a Trojan horse – or at least a stalking horse – for the European Army that Mr Juncker has said he would like to create . Whatever Britain’s views on the matter, with or without us, this stuff is happening. Since David Cameron declared his desire to renegotiate the UK’s position in Europe in his Bloomberg speech more than two years ago, the ground realities have shifted faster than anyone could have foreseen. The question, as the forces of European integration appear to gather pace, is where this leaves a United Kingdom whose instinctive attachment to sovereignty will never accept the vision for Europe laid out by Mr Juncker. The likely answer to that question was clearly audible in Strasbourg this week, and if you listened carefully, in the text of Mr Juncker’s speech. He declared emphatically the EU was better off with the world’s fifth-largest economy as a member – Germany agrees – and promised a workable deal for Mr Cameron come December. But that promise comes with a kicker. Britain can have its opt-outs and exceptions (within limits), but the price of special treatment will be to simultaneously surrender any claim to object to the integrationist schemes of other member states. “The UK's choices must not prevent them from further integration where they see fit,” said Mr Juncker, echoing an argument that – on Schengen, on migrants, on euro financial regulations – was repeated like a refrain this week in Strasbourg. This might be the real long-term outcome of the UK’s renegotiation in Europe. Put another way: Britain can stay in – and then butt out. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": ["http://t.co/XWCgM4cSXU"], "published": "2015-09-09T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T04:47:21.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
