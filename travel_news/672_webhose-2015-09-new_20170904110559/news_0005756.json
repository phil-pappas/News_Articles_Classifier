In his new role Ladner will define the standards by which Alaska operates company aircraft and qualifies pilots, and validate that those standards are being followed. Ladner replaces Tom Kemp, who was recently promoted to vice president of flight operations.\n“At Alaska we strive for operational excellence, while never losing sight of our primary value: Safety,” said Tom Kemp, Alaska Airlines’ vice president of flight operations. “John’s expertise in fleet standards is a great asset to our safety-first focus.”\nPreviously, Ladner served as Alaska’s managing director of Seattle airport operations. During his 19-year tenure at Alaska Airlines, Ladner has also served as Seattle base chief pilot, flight operations duty officer and was also a certified FAA check airman. He was also a pilot and check airman for Anchorage-based Era Aviation for nearly seven years.\nLadner holds degrees from Big Bend Community College and Central Washington University. In 2014, he also completed the University of Washington’s Executive Master of Business Administration program.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T08:50:16.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
