Hope On Wheels' Every Handprint Tells a Story September campaign theme honors the brave children and families throughout America fighting against this terrible disease. Since 1998, Hyundai Hope On Wheels has awarded over $100 million in lifetime funding to childhood cancer research.\n\"There's no higher calling than to make sure our children have the best future possible and it's both an honor and privilege to support such an important cause,\" said Dave Zuchowski , President and CEO of Hyundai Motor America. \"While we are making positive strides in many areas of pediatric cancer, there's still work to do. And it also doesn't change the fact that every 36 minutes a child is diagnosed with cancer. Reaching the milestone of $100 million in giving is something we are proud of at Hyundai but the fight continues and we are determined in our mission to one day find a cure. To all the kids, families and cancer researchers on the front lines of childhood cancer – know that you are not alone and we remain committed over the long-term to this important cause. \"\n2015 National Campaign: Every Handprint Tells a Story and PSA\nHyundai Hope on Wheels 2015 campaign Every Handprint Tells a Story is articulated through its refreshed web portal HopeOnWheels.org and new Childhood Cancer Awareness Month microsite HopeOnWheels.org/September . The theme conveys how every child's handprint is unique and represents their stories, dreams, desires and hopes, whether completing a round of chemotherapy, celebrating a beautiful new head of hair or playing their favorite sport.\nVisitors to the portal and social media channels will find a series of videos profiling child cancer patients and their parents and families with stories of bravery and hope. The website will also include research project overviews from the 2015 grant winners and provide an interactive element, where visitors can lend their own hand in the fight by changing their social media avatar, sharing a child's story of courage and hope on social channels or donating to fund research. Each week a family's story will be selected and shared on the Hope On Wheels website and social channels. Hope On Wheels will also launch a new public service announcement (PSA) that asks the public to join Hope On Wheels and add their hand in the fight to #EndChildhoodCancer. Kids, fathers, mothers, doctors and supporters who all have a vested interest in telling the story of kids' battles with cancer bring the video to life. The PSA can be seen on the Hope On Wheels website and can be shared on social media. To join our effort, please visit the Hope On Wheels website and \"click\" 'Add My Handprint' to join the fight against childhood cancer.

Customers may pick them up at local Hyundai dealerships across the country to show their support for September.\n\"Hope On Wheels together with Hyundai's 800-plus dealers across the country have been fighting this terrible disease for 17 years by funding life-saving research,\" said Hyundai Hope on Wheels Board Chairman and Managing Partner at Southpoint Hyundai Texas, Scott Stark . \"Our Every Handprint Tells A Story campaign is focused on telling every chapter of this unfortunate story that is childhood cancer. Pediatric cancer is an issue that affects children and their parents, siblings, caretakers, friends and loved ones. Cancer knows no income, community, gender or race.
