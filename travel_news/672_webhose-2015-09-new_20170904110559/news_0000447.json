I longed to relive the heart and soul of this captivating nation before its olde worlde charms, entrenched in the pre-embargo 1950s, evaporated like a puff of cigar smoke.\nSo I signed up with adventure travel firm Explore for an eight-day tailor-made trip. Staff wheel out the whole kit and caboodle, from modern bikes and like-minded companions to comfortable accommodation and the services of a dream team – smiling guide Jaime, mechanic Fernando and patient bus driver Andres.\n Next Why Gravetye Manor is quickly building a reputation as one...

What a golden opportunity.\nOur little group dressed in tight-fitting Lycra and brightly coloured helmets didn't exactly blend in with horses and carts clip-clopping over cobbles, oxen ploughing fertile furrows, or the rusty camellos (long buses) crammed with passengers rumbling along empty highways.\nIn Old Havana, brightly-coloured graffiti walls are just a few of the stunning sights for tourists to stumble upon\nBridget (pictured) cycled through the idyllic Cuban countryside, exploring tobacco plantations and fields of banana trees\nBut cycling through such idyllic countryside, being warmly welcomed with happy 'holas', serenaded by salsa bands and even being wolf-whistled at by passing drivers made us feel like kings and queens of the road.\nTRAVEL FACTS Explore ( explore.co.uk , 01252 884723) offers cycling holidays to Cuba that range from easy to challenging graded tours.\nAn eight-day Highlights Of Cuba By Bicycle tour starts from £1,588pp and includes return flights, five nights' hotel accommodation, two nights in a 'casa particular' on a B&B basis, one lunch, bike hire, transport and the services of a tour leader, driver and guide.\nThe spectacular landscape of tobacco plantations and banana trees, crystalline lakes and steep-sided mountains was breathtaking in more ways than one.\nBut I'm proud to say that I was only defeated by what seemed like one never-ending climb – I was forced to thumb a lift from our tour bus instead.\nMuch of the terrain was as flat as the infamous Bay of Pigs swampland, where an army of red crabs crossing the road stopped us in our tracks – much like the revolutionaries had halted the botched US invasion attempt in 1961.\nAlthough we cycled in the early morning or late afternoon, covering 15 to 20 miles a day, it was still hot and steamy thanks to the humidity. Taking a swim in the Caribbean Sea, followed by an ice-cold cocktail on deserted sandy shores, was a heavenly way to refresh.\nAmong the areas to explore is the quaint district of Vinales (pictured), as well as the coastal Cienfuegos\nCycling in the early morning or late afternoon, the group eventually made it to the city of Trinidad (pictured)\nAmong one of Havana's most celebrated restaurants is La Guarida, where Beyonce and Jay Z have dined\nNumb bottoms were soon forgotten when we checked into our comfortable hotels or friendly family-run guesthouses, called casas particulares.\nFrom vibrant Havana and quaint Vinales to coastal Cienfuegos and Trinidad, the accommodation had vastly improved since my last visit in 2000. The restaurants also served better food, while the mojitos and sunsets were just as good as I remembered.\nOn the final evening, we dined at La Guarida, a restaurant in Havana frequented by Beyoncé and Jay-Z, and Hollywood legends Steven Spielberg and Jack Nicholson – their photos are displayed on the walls for all to see. Now that definitely would never have happened before.\nAnd we would have danced at the trendy new nightclub Fabrica de Arte Cubano but for an untimely power cut. Oh well, at least some of Cuba's unique charms never change.\nRead more: Adventure Holidays | Adventure Tours | Adventure Travel from EXPLORE!", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1iTzKFK", "http://explore.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-09-27T07:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T00:48:19.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
