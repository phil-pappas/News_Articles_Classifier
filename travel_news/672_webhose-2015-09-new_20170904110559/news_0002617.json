Catering and events company FoodShow has been awarded a five year contract worth around £3m to deliver external event catering and production and event management services as and when required at London’s new events venue. \nPart of the contract will see FoodShow work alongside the in-house sales and marketing team to promote the venue’s facilities to the corporate and private market driving the newly formed events business forward. A total of 8 spaces are available for events from breakfast through to dinner, plus a secluded garden of some nine acres nestling between Westminster and Lambeth Bridge. FoodShow co-founder and CEO Andrew Gosling said: “Lambeth Palace is an exquisite venue in central London with myriad spaces; each with their own individual charm and a vast private garden ideal for large scale events, company fun days and outside team building without having to leave the city. There isn’t another venue in London that can offer this. We are thrilled to become the preferred catering partner at the venue and look forward to producing excellent dining experiences with a focus on provenance, quality and superior service.” Louise Donovan, head of events, Lambeth Palace said: “FoodShow shares our passion and commitment to put Lambeth Palace on the map as a destination for events. This coupled with FoodShow’s creativity for producing catering with innovative menus and excellent customer service makes for a great partnership.” Located on the south bank of the River Thames, Lambeth Palace is available to hire throughout the year for a variety of events including cocktail parties, receptions, meetings, dinners and conferences. The secluded nine acre grounds are ideal for garden parties, teambuilding and family fun days accommodating over 1,000 guests. A permanent marquee structure provides shelter for inclement weather and ideal for dining in the stunning gardens in the summer. Event spaces include the Guard Room hosting 80 for dinner and 150 for receptions; the State Room which has stunning views across the gardens, and has welcomed the Queen and the Pope, can host 80 guests with an adjoining small break out room. The Great Hall caters up to 200 reception style and 150 for dinner. The Atrium and Chapel offer additional spaces which provide a beautiful intermediary backdrop. The Great Hall has just undertaken an extensive refurbishment and has recently re-opened. The Great Hall and other events spaces will be formally launched to the industry with a showcase on the 1st October 2015.
