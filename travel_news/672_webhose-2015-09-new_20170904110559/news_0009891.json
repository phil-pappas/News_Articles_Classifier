And make certain to do it by heli. Flights depart from Las Vegas and South Rim. Discover how to get the best. Read this article. \nA Grand Canyon helicopter is a fun way to spend a weekend vacation. Labor Day weekend will be here soon, so now is the ideal time to plan a trip to Vegas and book your exciting canyon tour.Vegas is a great place to start your helicopter tour because you'll get your choice of a landing or air tour. Since the tours all fly along the same route on the way to the canyon, you'll get to see the impressive Hoover Dam and Lake Mead on both types of tours. You'll also be treated to amazing views of the Grand Canyon and the Colorado River flowing at its base. While the air-only tours circle the canyon and head back to Vegas, the landing tours stop at the canyon so you can get out and explore the area. Landing Tour OptionsYou can choose from a variety of air tours, but you should consider booking the deluxe landing tour that lifts off from the Vegas Strip. The deluxe tours are superior because they fly on the advanced EcoStar 130 helicopter, plus you'll get free hotel transportation in a limousine. You can take one of these tours on a chopper that flies down to the canyon floor so you can get out near the banks of the Colorado River. As a nice touch, this tour comes with a champagne picnic, and you can even take a boat tour along the Colorado River if you like. Touring The South RimYou can also take a tour out of Vegas that goes to the South Rim, and if you'll be in Arizona rather than Vegas, you'll be closer to the South Rim, so your tour will go there. South Rim tours lift off from Tusayan, Arizona and you can drive yourself there from any point in Arizona, or you can buy a Vegas tour that includes a flight that gets you there in about an hour. You get to choose from the least expensive half hour air tour of the South Rim, or the longer tour that lasts nearly an hour, which is highly recommended. On the longer tour, you get to see the land between the South and North Rims as well as the area of the park all the way to the eastern boundary. You'll see many amazing and beautiful sights on this tour. Your chopper won't be allowed to land at the South Rim, but you can add on a 4x4 tour of the park instead. One way to do this is to book a package that comes with a 30-minute flight over the canyon with a ground tour that gives you 2 1/2 hours to tour the park by land. Seeing the canyon by air and land is the perfect combination for appreciating the beauty and immensity of the canyon. EcoStar Sightseeing ChoppersBooking a deluxe tour ensures you'll have the best viewing experience possible on a helicopter tour. The deluxe helicopters are made with large panoramic windows so you have outstanding views without obstruction, plus the seats are designed for comfort and personal space. The cabins are much quieter than those of older helicopters and they are able to fly much smoother too. If you can find seats on a deluxe tour, you should definitely book them. Helicopter Tours On Labor DaySeptember 5-7 is Labor Day weekend, and it's the last three-day weekend of the year and a wrap up to the summer vacation season.
