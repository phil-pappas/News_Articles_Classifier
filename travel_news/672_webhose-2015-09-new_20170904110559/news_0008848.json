Twelve Irish tourism companies, including hotels, visitor attractions and activity providers, as well as representatives of KLM and Aer Lingus, took part in the workshop – meeting and doing business for 2016 with 30 Dutch travel professionals.\nKaren van der Horst, Tourism Ireland’s manager in the Netherlands, said: “We are delighted that so many key Dutch travel agents and tour operators have taken the time to meet with our partners from Ireland, to learn about our superb tourism offering and in particular our latest tourism experiences, Ireland’s Ancient East and The Gobbins Coastal Path. The Netherlands is an important market for tourism to the island of Ireland, with the latest CSO figures indicating growth of +7% in visitors from the Benelux countries to Ireland in the May to July period. Tourism Ireland is determined to ensure that growth continues and we are rolling out a busy programme of promotions in the Netherlands this autumn .”\nLast week, Ryanair announced a new service between Amsterdam and Dublin, with four daily flights set to commence on 27 October, providing a welcome boost for tourism from the Netherlands. Karen van der Horst continued: “The introduction of the new Ryanair service from Amsterdam to Dublin is really good news, helping to expand travel options for Dutch business and leisure travellers wish to visit Ireland in 2016. With flights also available from Aer Lingus, KLM and easyJet from the Netherlands to Dublin, Belfast and Cork, our message to the Dutch travel trade is that it has never been easier to get to the island of Ireland.”\nSource:- Tourism Ireland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T09:03:08.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
