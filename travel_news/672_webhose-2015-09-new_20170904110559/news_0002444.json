Photograph by: Handout photos , Singh Farms \nScottsdale , Ariz., is a desert destination known for its golf courses and spa treatments, hiking trails and proximity to Phoenix , the state’s capital. \nOf late, it’s also become a hub for foodie folk, with everything from local coffee roasters to organic farms to taco spots popping up then filling up with locals and visitors alike. \nMany of these new initiatives are in the old town and downtown. This part of the city is easily and enjoyably navigable by foot – a nice change of pace from much of Scottsdale’s suburban feel and the car culture that’s associated with it. Old town and downtown are the home of the arts district and its weekly ArtWalk , the entertainment district and its bars, lounges and clubs, and the waterfront, where public art dots both shores of the Arizona Canal. It’s even the future neighbourhood for the city’s first Shake Shack location, which locals are excitedly anticipating, a nod to the area’s burgeoning hipster cred if ever there was one. \nThere are almost 800 restaurants in the city helmed by a mix of people – local chefs who might not be native but have lived in the area for years and are having fun putting innovative twists on local ingredients, as well as folks returning to the city to take advantage of the weather and availability of fresh food as well as the hungry clientele, a mix of wealthy residents who like to indulge in tasting menus and copious amounts of wine and young creative types who are looking for fancy and affordable fast food. \nHere, is a look at some of the hottest spots in town that will satiate your appetite – whatever you’re craving. \nFOR THE COFFEE OR CRAFT BEER LOVER \nHidden in the parking lot of a nondescript intersection, and sitting across from a Walgreens and Staples, Sip Coffee and Beer House is a hub of activity in downtown Scottsdale. The space, filled with eclectic decor, is home to the self-employed during the day who savour a cuppa of locally roasted beans from Cartel Coffee Lab . \nAt night, the floor is turned over to live music acts, from bluegrass to deep funk, and patrons take advantage of the 19 rotating craft beers on tap. The food menu isn’t particularly expansive, but it does use locally sourced produce in salads, sandwiches and wraps, making this an idea spot to grab a mid-morning coffee and then lunch to go. \n3617 N. Goldwater Rd., sipcoffeeandbeerhouse.com \nFOR THE WINE LOVER \nThe recently opened Wine Gallery by Lawrence Dunham Vineyards is a former home turned into a cellar and art gallery in downtown Scottsdale. Visitors can have a taste of local Arizona wine produced by winemaker Curt Dunham on 16 hectares in the Chiricahua mountain range. LDV specializes in Rhone varietals, so guests will be sipping on Syrah, Grenache and Viognier. As well as the wines, local art is on display and, if you call ahead, Dunham and Peggy Fiandaca, his wife and co-owner, can arrange a private on-site picnic on request. \n6951 E. 1st St., lawrencedunhamvineyards.com \nFOR THE FARM-FRESH ENTHUSIAST \nA visit to Singh Farms is a must. Spread over eight lush hectares, the desert blooms with kale, artichokes, mushrooms and more, and the farm buzzes on Saturdays when locals descend to shop for fresh produce, bread, olive oil and honey. Local chefs, who often turn to Singh’s produce when stocking their kitchens, are also in attendance cooking up their specialties, so guests can grab breakfast and groceries in one go. If you’re travelling with little ones – and even if you aren’t – save some time to tour the grounds and say hello to the growing animal population, which includes horses and peacocks. \n8900 E. Thomas Rd., facebook.com/singhfarms \nFOR THE COMFORT-FOOD GOURMAND \nCitizen Public House shines in old town Scottsdale, and is expanding to a second floor, where it will show off its craft beer and cocktail offerings. Diners can gorge on a menu that doesn’t sacrifice fun for sophistication – think Gorgonzola-Emmental mac and cheese and entrées such as pan-seared scallops served over roasted sweet corn grits. And let’s face it – after being on the losing end of a golf game or getting your butt kicked by the ascent while hiking Camelback Mountain , a little fun is in order. The Citizen is a local favourite, and its expansion will make this even more of a hot spot in old town Scottsdale. \n7111 E. 5th Ave., citizenpublichouse.com \nFOR THE HUNGRY HIPSTER \nDiego Pops is where the cool kids head for gourmet tacos and nachos – toppings include brussels sprouts and fried eggs. Launched in late 2014 by the team that opened the thriving Original ChopShop Co. , the Mexican menu is fun, tasty and has some edge. The same applies to the restaurant’s atmosphere, which balances a laid-back vibe with bold pieces of art. A sign proclaiming “Say yes to tacos!” greets visitors upon arrival, for instance. The best seat in the house is any seat on the spacious patio, and the best dish is whichever of their seven taco varieties tickles your fancy. \n4338 N. Scottsdale Rd., diegopops.com \nFOR THOSE IN NEED OF A SUGAR FIX \nThough part of a small chain, Scottsdale’s entertainment district is home to the state’s first Sprinkles Cupcake ATM . It started dispensing flavours, from red velvet to maple bacon, at the end of 2014 and, open 24 hours a day like a true ATM, it has been doing brisk business since, selling 1,500 cupcakes on its first day of business. \n4501 North Scottsdale Rd., sprinkles.com © Copyright (c) Postmedia Network Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T17:46:10.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
