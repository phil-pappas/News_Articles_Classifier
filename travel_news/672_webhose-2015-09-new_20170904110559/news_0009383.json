The canyon is 270 miles from Vegas, but if you take a plane tour, you will get there quickly. Going to the canyon by air is the best option because it gives you a lot more time to enjoy the canyon that you would otherwise spend in a car or bus if you go by land. Grand Canyon Plane Tours Operate Daily You have your choice of three daily flights to the Grand Canyon. Your time in the air isn't wasted as you'll see plenty of interesting sights such as an aerial view of Lake Mead. You'll also get a unique view of the Hoover Dam as it towers 725 feet above the Colorado River. Your plane will head to the Grand Canyon National Park in Tusayan, Arizona and you'll get glimpses of the canyon along the way. For the best views from the plane, try to get a seat on the left side. You have a variety of tour options available. One option you may want to add to an affordable basic tour is a 2.5 hour bus ride through the Grand Canyon National Park. You'll see all the main highlights on the bus tour, but another option is to tour by Jeep. The Jeep tour allows you to go off road, and you'll get about 2.5 hours to explore. You'll actually see more on the Jeep tour and the experience is fun. When you pick out your air tour, you should consider the helicopter option that flies over to the remote North Rim and then circles back. This tour goes over the Dragoon Corridor, which is the widest and deepest part of the canyon. Although this tour is a little expensive, it is well worth the cost. This tour offers spectacular aerial views of the Grand Canyon along with a ground tour where you can experience the canyon up close and personal. Fly In Comfort You get your choice of two different aircraft on these tours. The most common planes used are the de-Havilland Twin Otter and the Beechcraft 1900D. Each has its own advantages, so pick the one that you prefer. The wings on the de-Havilland Twin Otter planes are on top so they won't block your view, and the windows are large and idea for sightseeing. The seats are nice and roomy, but some of them are not window seats because one side of the plane has a double row of seats while the other side has a single row. There is a recorded flight narrative you can listen to in your choice of 10 languages including Chinese, Japanese, French, and German. The Beechcraft is more like a regular jet with its slender body and wings situated right in the middle of the airplane. Every seat on this plane is a window seat, which you can enjoy from your roomy, comfortable seat. You'll have to pay more for a Beechcraft tour, but you'll be guaranteed a window seat, so its worth it. All fees associated with the tour is included in the price. There will be no additional charge for entry passes, taxes, surcharges, or miscellaneous fees because they are all included in the price of your tour. Your pilot will act as your guide during the tour and as an added bonus, you'll also get free pick up and drop off service to your Las Vegas hotel. The tour includes everything in one convenient price. A Fantastic Experience Is Waiting If you want to see the Grand Canyon and truly appreciate it, you should take an air tour. When you take an air tour, you won't have to waste time driving to the Grand Canyon, plus, you'll tour in comfort and you're sure to see all the highlights. Compare an 11-hour bus or car ride to make the round trip from Vegas to Tusayan compared to a quick one hour flight, and you'll see why a plane tour is the best choice. Air tours are very popular, so they sell out quickly, therefore, book your tour early and do it online so you can get an Internet discount. \nGrand Canyon expert Lea Fallon is a huge fan of Canyon sightseeing flights and recommends going here to get the Vegas-South Rim express at the cheapest price possible: http://lasvegasgrandcanyonairplane.com/coupons.html   08   13  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T01:24:37.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
