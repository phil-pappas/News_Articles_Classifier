We are always being accused by the younger generation of being ridiculously smug , self-satisfied and complacent as we watch the value of our homes rise minute by minute and sit in our counting-houses counting up how rich we are while contemplating our next round the world cruise. But it’s not true, says the Alliance, a coalition of organisations devoted to promoting positive aspects of ageing. Many of us are not that well off and for those who are, there are good reasons why we appear to be richer than our children and grandchildren. Mainly, it’s because, as the poet Milton said, we shunned delights and lived laborious days. So, if you do want to be rich at 25 and sitting pretty in retirement, here’s how you do it: Marry young You marry young and have children relatively young. Unlike the present generation, we did not gad off round the world in our twenties and thirties, with the result that we were pushing prams and taking on unpayable mortgages at 50. After leaving university, we got our heads straight down to serious work and we stayed in work even when the jobs were not all that congenial. I spent time as a teacher in a rough secondary modern girls’ school in South Shields; can’t imagine either of my sons or their partners doing that. You must both work Both partners have to be earners. Then as now, it is the only way of having a good income and pleasant lifestyle. Many of today’s women, by contrast, become permanent stay at home mums after taking a year’s maternity leave with their first child. There is also the growing phenomenon of househusbands ; unthinkable in our day. No more babies You don’t have more than two children . We never did as we felt we could not afford any more. Many of today’s families gaily embark on three or more children and then complain they don’t have any money. Also, don’t indulge in expensive pets. We didn’t. A designer dog can cost as much as a child and for many families today, the right dog has become a must-have accessory. Buy a 'fixer-upper' To get on the housing ladder early , you have to buy a property that needs a lot of work. This is what we did, and we spent our evenings and weekends painting and decorating. Instead of buying the latest furnishings from John Lewis on credit cards, we slept on mattresses and put sheets up at the window. It was the only way of being eventually decently housed. The present generation is not prepared to do this. Say goodbye to luxuries You forget about having fun. We never had any fun; at least, not when we were young. I never had any fun until I was in my forties and could finally afford it. Nor did we eat out in restaurants, except on special occasions. Expensive coffee houses and sandwich bars did not exist. Avoid credit cards You don’t get into debt. We never did, partly because easy credit was hard to come by. But today, it can be a badge of pride that you are maxed out on your credit cards . Some otherwise intelligent people believe they have settled their month’s credit card bill by paying the minimum amount, seemingly oblivious to the 20% or more interest rates they are racking up. For my generation, such profligacy would be unthinkable. Unless we could pay off the whole amount at the end of the month, we would not buy the item in the first place. It is true that our generation started adult life debt-free as we did not have to pay for university, and that was a huge plus. But we were, by and large, frugal, careful and hardworking. In a sense, we didn’t know how to be anything else, but for some of us at least, that attitude has paid off. @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T09:32:30.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
