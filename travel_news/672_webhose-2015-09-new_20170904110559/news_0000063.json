Eclectic, clever, and wildly-independent, this festival matches the spirit of Seattle and Decibel’s attendees. Nowadays, it’s a five-day affair that customarily attracts more than 25,000 people per year. The best part about this event is that it is completely free! On top of that, the accompanying music will be provided by DJ Gigs (aka Natasha Kmeto: Dropping Gems, Portland) and Decibel Festival founder himself, DJ Nordic Soul (aka Sean Horton: Decibel Festival, Seattle). Along with these amazing Northwest artists, the fountain will be illuminated with projection mapping provided by Baryonyx. On Saturday and Sunday there will be two boat parties for those adventurous enough to head out on the water in late September.\nFounded in 2003, Decibel Festival has become a unique platform for exposing attendees to leading-edge multimedia art from around the globe. With a focus on live performance, interactive multimedia art, state-of-the-art sound and technology based education; Decibel has solidified itself as one of the premier electronic music festivals and promotional organizations in the world.\nGetting into Seattle isn’t hard from its airport, and you’ve got a whole city of accommodations to choose from. The heart of the activity takes place in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. However, as the festival has grown, it’s literally expanded across the city but settling mostly in clusters of Capitol Hill, SoDo and downtown neighborhoods.\nWhen: September 23 – 27\nWhere: Seattle, Washington, US", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:15:33.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
