Photo via meijergardens.org \nOne flower is taking over Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park. \nMeijer Gardens opened its fall “Chrysanthemums and More!” exhibit last week, with the largest display of chrysanthemums and fall foliage in Michigan. Chrysanthemums of all colors create waves throughout the grounds. \nThe exhibit will run until Nov. 1. \nMany of the chrysanthemums are yellow, to honor The Richard and Helen DeVos Japanese Garden, which opened this year. Yellow blooms are on the imperial seal of the Japanese emperor. \n“‘Chrysanthemums and More!’ has become a true fall tradition. Mums provide a bold impact of color that transforms Meijer Gardens,” said Steve LaWarre, director of horticulture, Meijer Gardens. “We’re brushing landscapes with bursts of gold and yellow in honor of the Japanese tradition.” \nOrange and purple chrysanthemums will be layered throughout the gardens as well, ornamented by cabbage and kale. \nRepresentatives from Meijer Gardens also suggest visiting the Japanese Garden as it changes colors with the fall. \n“This garden’s appearance will really change with the fall colors, when blanketed in snow and with fresh new growth in the spring,” LaWarre said. \nEvents \nSeveral special events are scheduled throughout the exhibition: \nFall Bonsai Show: Oct. 3, 10 a.m.-5 p.m. \nFall Family Days: Oct. 10 and 11, 1-4 p.m. \nGiant Pumpkins at Michigan’s Farm Garden: Oct. 17 and 18, 1-4 p.m. \nMum Day: Oct. 18, 1-4 p.m. \nHallowee-Ones: Oct. 23, 10 a.m.-noon", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T00:32:24.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
