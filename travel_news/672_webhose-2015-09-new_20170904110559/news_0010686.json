But where will we be exploring in 2016? The luxury holiday specialists have given their verdict on the destinations set to become holiday hot spots over the coming year, with Abercrombie & Kent travellers leading the way. COLOMBIA Colombia has experienced some of the sharpest rises in visitor numbers across all of South America in recent years. Travellers are being lured by the Caribbean coast’s pristine beaches, which remain blissfully uncrowded even during peak season from December to February. The country’s picturesque Coffee Triangle offers trekking and horse riding in the rolling countryside, while visits to the Amazon or Sierra Nevada jungles provide challenging expeditions for more intrepid travellers. With so much variety in such a vast country, creating a comprehensive itinerary will challenge even the most energetic adventurers. There is even the chance of Abercrombie & Kent customers to see the country by private jet. INDIA Disney’s upcoming remake of The Jungle Book may have an A-list cast, but it’s the film’s spectacular scenery that could be the star of the show. Set in India, the film stars Scarlett Johansson, Sir Ben Kingsley and Idris Elba and is set for release in April next year with travel experts at Abercrombie & Kent expecting the blockbuster to drive a surge in tourism. And a new online visa scheme has ensured it is even easier for British travellers to explore India’s snow-capped mountain ranges, enchanting backwater cruises, bustling cities and a thriving culinary scene.

December also marks the 30th anniversary of the release of Hollywood classic Out of Africa. The film not only won seven Academy Awards, it also prompted a huge boost in tourism to the East African nation in the 1980s. Travel experts believe a new focus on the movie could inspire a similar revival in fortunes, while Abercrombie & Kent are even offering to take travellers to the spot where Meryl Streep and Robert Redford famously sat for their picnic in the Masai Mara nature reserve.

In fact, residents are almost equalled by the number of saunas – 3.3 million of them – making Finland an amazing spa destination. Finnish Lapland is also one of the best locations in the world to witness the Northern Lights, with the awe-inspiring light show visible on around 200 nights of the year between August and April. AUSTRALIA Australia welcomed more than 650,000 British tourists last year, with industry experts predicting that number will double over the next five years. Many come to visit the Great Barrier Reef, the world’s largest coral reef ecosystem covering an area of almost 217,000 square miles and considered one of the seven wonders of the natural world. Even more travellers will be inspired to visit in 2016 thanks to David Attenborough’s big-budget, three-part documentary about the Unesco World Heritage site which will be screened in more than 130 countries early next year. THAILAND Thailand is fast earning a reputation for providing some of the most affordable four- and five-star accommodation in the world. From the Sarojin resort on a seven-mile stretch of the Andaman coast to private yachts, sumptuous villas and the country’s exclusive tented jungle camp at Elephant Hills, Thailand is opening up as a luxury hot spot far removed from its outdated backpacker image. Combine that with fascinating cities, amazing historical sites and friendly locals and the Land of Smiles is set to become a new favourite. NOVA SCOTIA Just over six hours from London by plane, Nova Scotia is becoming a surprise short-break destination for Britons keen to experience the world-class culinary and music scenes. The Canadian province has a strong Celtic culture and celebrates its cultural offerings with around 550 festivals a year. Also known as the land of “lighthouses and lobster traps”, Nova Scotia’s capital city is situated on the world’s second-largest harbour, with the 186-mile Cabot Trail offering a dramatic way to explore the rugged coastline of Cape Breton Island.

British Airways will fly from London to Lima from May 2016, making visiting the country easier than ever before. Combine that with a growing interest in Peru’s “undiscovered” north, flights linking tourist hot spots such as Lima and Brazil’s Iguassu Falls and the rise of river cruising in the Amazon basin, there really is something for everyone. Peru’s crowning glory – Machu Picchu – grows in popularity every year, while lesser-known Inca trails such as Ancascocha, Choquequirao and Huchuy Cusco have also been attracting more visitors. CHINA More than 550,000 British tourists visited China last year, with many heading to well-known visitor spots such as Beijing's famous Forbidden City, the Great Wall and the Terracotta Army in Xi'an. However, a rapidly expanding high-speed rail network is opening up vast swathes of rural areas previously off the tourist map. Away from the densely populated cities, China offers adventurous travellers the chance to experience everything from lakes in Tibet to snow-capped mountains and ancient cultures.

The region has not only seen increased Northern Lights activity in recent years, it is also the perfect spot to see such animals as polar bears in their natural habitat. Combine this with remote communities and a fascinating mixed history and you have a truly varied destination. The proliferation of luxury polar cruises, using exceptional ships such as Le Boreal, offers another way to explore the best of the Arctic in real comfort.
