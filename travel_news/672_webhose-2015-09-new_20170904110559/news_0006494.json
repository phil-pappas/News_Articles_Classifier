On 4 September it was in the top 5 trending topics in the UK on Twitter.\nThe excitement of the railway is only set to grow worldwide with the launch of a VisitScotland international marketing campaign in the USA next month, followed by promotional activity in Germany early next year.\nThe 30-mile route is set to boost the tourism economy and grow the 11,000 growth sector businesses operating in Edinburgh, Midlothian and the Scottish Borders – which amounted to £21 billion of gross value added to the Scottish economy in 2013. The food and drink sector and creative industries in Midlothian and Scottish Borders alone contribute £103 million to the economy.\nVisitScotland is supporting attractions, accommodation providers, local producers and pubs and restaurants in the vicinity of the Borders Railway in developing new ideas, products and experiences to further boost the visitor economy which supports 6,000 jobs.\nMike Cantlay, Chairman of VisitScotland said:\n“The start of services on the Borders Railway was not only a historic moment for Scotland but a truly global affair with an audience of millions watching both the excellent coverage from the launch weekend, but also HM The Queen opening the line as she celebrated becoming Britain’s longest serving monarch.\n“The magical Scottish Borders is one of Scottish tourism’s greatest assets with its rich heritage and beautiful and inspiring landscape. The Borders Railway, which delves deep into Sir Walter Scott country, presents a huge opportunity for Scottish tourism to breathe new life into the area, touching on every industry, business and community.”\nSupermodel and current Pringle of Scotland muse, Anna Freemantle, joined VisitScotland to launch the railway on 4 September with a special Media Day, featuring around 100 invited journalists, before it was officially opened by Her Majesty The Queen on 9 September – the day that she became Britain’s longest serving Monarch.\nA special ‘Golden Ticket’ Day was held on Saturday 5 September. Public services began on 6 September with more than 2,500 passengers using the service on the first day.\nKeith Brown, Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure, Investment and Cities said:\n“The celebrations to mark the completion of the Borders Railway were a fitting way to mark the fulfilment of a project that will open up a unique and iconic part of the country to visitors, and a promise made by the Scottish Government to reconnect residents of the Borders to the Scottish rail network and beyond.\n“Having been there myself at the official opening on Wednesday to sample the atmosphere and feel-good factor I have no doubt that the new line will serve as a catalyst for major investment in the area.\n“Not only is the Borders Railway a success by the scale of its ambition, but also for bringing together communities, councils, and Government to deliver a challenging infrastructure project both on time and on budget. Such vision and collaboration means that the Borders has become a symbol of the renaissance of our railways in Scotland.”\nDanny Cusick, Senior Director Food & Drink, Tourism and Textiles at Scottish Enterprise and Chair of the Borders Railway Blueprint Leaders Group, said:\n“Borders Railway will breathe new life into the economies of Scottish Borders and Midlothian, and will create a tourism and investment boost for the whole of Scotland. The Borders Railway Blueprint aims to maximise the economic benefits of the new rail connection between Edinburgh and Tweedbank, capitalising on the transformational impact of the new line in creating new places to live, work, visit, learn, play and grow.”\nA ScotRail Alliance spokesperson said:\n“There’s a great buzz about the Borders Railway, particularly after such a successful opening weekend, with more than 2,500 journeys last Sunday alone – the first day of passenger rail services to and from Tweedbank.\n“We’re pleased to be working with Scottish Rail Preservation Society to run our first-ever steam trains. These are proving popular with customers and helping boost the Borders economy. Due to the huge demand, we added extra carriages to 16 of our 17 Borders steam trains, with these additional tickets selling out within a week.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T14:08:44.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
