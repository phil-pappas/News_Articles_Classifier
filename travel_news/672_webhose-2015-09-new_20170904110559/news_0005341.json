A spokesperson for the MA told the Telegraph that at least 50 magistrates have given up their positions, \"but it could in fact be a lot more\". Richard Monkhouse, chairman of the MA, said the number of magistrates leaving the voluntary role was “deeply worrying”. “The issue has caused a level of concern among our members that I have not seen before and they tell us that it is about fairness. They're reporting a clear influence on pleas with the very strong temptation for defendants to plead guilty to avoid a higher charge,” he told the Independent. \"When coupled with the fact we do not believe the vast majority of charges will ever be recovered because your average defendant cannot pay, we're reiterating our call for the Lord Chancellor to grant an urgent review and to give magistrates discretion on its case-by-case application, including means testing.\" The charge was introduced by former Justice Secretary Chris Grayling Photo: GEOFF PUGH The charge, introduced by former Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, is set at £150 for a guilty plea in the magistrates court, but rises to up to £1,000 for defendants who are found guilty after a trial by magistrates. For defendants who are found guilty in a Crown Court trial, the charge can rise to £1,200. Justice Secretary Michael Gove, who replaced Mr Grayling in May, told MPs on Tuesday he will review the criminal courts charge as he acknowledged \"widespread concern\" about its operation. Mr Gove stressed that the charge should only be levied after other fines have been paid and that it should be linked to the offender's ability to pay. Mr Monkhouse said: \"With each resigning magistrate the system is losing experienced justices who give their time freely to administer the law. \"The influence our members are seeing on defendants’ pleas doesn’t at all sit comfortably with the high standard of fairness they seek to uphold. We implore the Lord Chancellor to intervene, to grant and urgent review and give magistrates power discretion over its use.\" Speaking to the Independent, a Ministry of Justice spokesman said: \"It is right that convicted adult offenders who use our criminal courts should pay towards the cost of running them. \"The introduction of this charge makes it possible to recover some of the costs of the criminal courts from these offenders, therefore reducing the burden on taxpayers. \"Instalment payments can be set up if a defendant’s means do not allow prompt payment in full.\" telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T18:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T04:34:47.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
