David, who runs Goin’ Off Safaris, is not going to be on his phone, when he could be with someone who has flown halfway around the world to hand-feed a wild koala in the bush, or learn how to open oysters straight from the oyster farm, or just sit around a campfire under the sheer cliffs of the Great Australian Bight, with a glass of riesling. As he says, “it’s about sharing my backyard”. David knows that the best thing about any Australian backyard – even a big one like the Eyre Peninsula – is getting together with the locals to share good food and wine and have a few laughs. The six-day self-drive Eyre Peninsula Seafood Trail is one way to do that, packed with amazing scenery, great small towns and a culinary delight at every turn. Seafood supper: head to the coast to sample fresh seafood South Australia’s dazzling landscapes vary dramatically from the crystalline waters of the Southern Ocean to the red sands of the Flinders Ranges and the rolling vine-covered hills of the Barossa Valley. And there are so many ways to explore, from guided gourmet tours and self-drive foodie trails to the simple pleasures of hiring a bike and finding a shady vineyard for a meals-on-wheels picnic. Take the road less travelled Ben Neville of Adelaide-based Off Piste 4WD tours is another Aussie bloke madly in love with sharing his own backyard – which, in this case, means fording the creeks, driving up the vertiginous cliffs and cruising through the bushland trails of South Australia’s Fleurieu Peninsula. Ben’s tours leave time between to stop at a couple of acclaimed McLaren Vale wineries to meet the winemaker, taste the new releases, and pat the (inevitable) winery dog. For those with a little more time, it’s easy enough to grab a hire car and just follow your nose (or any number of self-drive tours and trails) to get a real sense of the place. First stop could well be less than 30 minutes’ leisurely drive from Adelaide, at one of the oldest family names in the wine business, the illustrious Penfolds. The Magill Estate is home to Australia’s most celebrated shiraz. It is also home to one of the region’s newest gastronomic spots – a contemporary Kitchen & Cellar Bar. Stop for slow-roasted brisket of beef with polenta, or grilled local flathead fish from the same talented chef duo, Scott Huggins and Emma McCaskill, of the renowned Magill Estate Restaurant. One foodie trail, grandly titled The Epicurean Way, starts in Adelaide and takes in the Adelaide Hills, looping around to include the famous Barossa Valley, the northern Clare Valley and the southern McLaren Vale region; making it one of Australia’s most rewarding touring routes for the gastronomically curious. Meals on (two) wheels The gentle contours of the Clare Valley landscape two hours north of Adelaide are perfect for meals on wheels. Rent a bicycle in one of the towns or villages, and set off on The Riesling Trail, following the sign-posted tracks of a former railway line. It seems only sensible to break the journey with a glass of the region’s award-winning tipple at wineries such as Grosset or Taylor’s. Pedal power: work up an appetite on a cycle tour The butcher, the baker and the winemaker The Barossa Valley was first settled by German-speaking settlers from Silesia in the 1840s, and has a ridiculous amount of charm strewn throughout its bracelet of small historic towns and villages. A self-drive tour is the most delicious way to link the numerous vineyards, golf courses, cheese-makers, bakeries, butchers and smokehouses and breweries. If you’re worried about missing out, join the Barossa Butcher, Baker, Winemaker Trail. All you have to do is purchase your VIP vouchers and a picnic hamper filled with cutlery, napkins, wine glasses and your Trail Map – then off you go. Pick up your pre-paid bottle of wine at one of 10 local wineries, then build your gourmet picnic as you meander from stop to stop – perhaps some gooey triple-cream cheese from the Barossa Valley Cheese Company in Angaston, bread from the Tanunda Bakery, and smoked mettwurst sausage from Steiny’s smokehouse in Tanunda. It’s a picnic on wheels, as you meander from farm gate to café, market stall to brewery, winery to picnic spot. Eat local The brilliant thing about this way of travelling is that you can’t help but meet the locals. Pick up a bag of the Barossa’s famed dried fruits and meet the Steicke family who run the Gully Gardens orchards and farm, or chat to Steve Zimmerman of Zimmy’s Barossa Valley Produce as you try to choose between his exemplary dill cucumbers and award-winning pickled onions. Look out for the “Eat Local” signs or download the Eat Local app to get a real taste of the region, whether it’s pheasant pâté from Maggie’s Farm Shop in Nuriootpa; or pickled grapes from Patly Hill Farm and B&B in the Clare Valley. At your own pace: hire a car to explore South Australia The real joy of travelling at your own pace is that you can stop when you want and pull over on a bush road for a picnic under an olive tree. You can breathe in the gum-scented air or walk barefoot over pristine sand. With any luck, there will also be a moment when you’re tootling along a South Australian country road, singing out loud, with your swimming gear hanging out the back window of the car to dry. When that happens, congratulations. You are now, officially, a local.
