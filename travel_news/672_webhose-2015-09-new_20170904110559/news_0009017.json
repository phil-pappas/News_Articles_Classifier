Learn more about the show here: CNN.com/journeys .\n(CNN) Torn between the soup or salad to start?\nCan't decide whether to go for chicken, duck or fish to follow?\nIf decision-making in restaurants has never been your strong point, then Paris could be your dream destination.\n\"Monomania\" is a venue's devotion -- some may say obsession -- to one ingredient.\nThe movement has taken Paris by storm, with a wave of bars, cafes, restaurants and pop-ups opening where one ingredient or signature dish is the hero -- and the diner's choice suddenly becomes a whole lot easier.\nIt partly takes its cue from the French love of specialty food shops, while the nation's dedication to produce from designated origins -- AOC or Appellation d'Origine Controlee -- is already well known and fiercely protected.\nMichelin-starred chefs and cafe owners alike have embraced it, providing a unique window on key ingredients and the multitude of ways in which they can be prepared.\nIt's not just French ingredients or dishes.\nCaviar, mozzarella and Japanese gyoza all now boast their own unique dining destinations.\nHere are just some of the one-track options out there in the City of Light.\nEggs & Co\nNo prizes for guessing the hero in this cozy Latin Quarter cafe -- it's the humble \"oeuf,\" in all its forms.\nDownstairs is a compact space with wooden beams but the mezzanine upstairs is roomier.\nBoth are frequently packed with locals and tourists alike from late breakfast (they open at 10 a.m.) through to early evening.\nAs you'd expect, weekend brunches are packed.\nOmelets, scrambled, fried, Benedict, baked in small pots (en cocotte) -- you name it, they can do it, accompanied by a mind-boggling array of herbs, vegetables, cheeses, meats and more.\nEggs & Co , 11 rue Bernard Palissy, 75006 Paris France;\nWhich came first, the chicken or the egg? At Eggs & Co, the egg always has top billing. L'Huitrade\nOne of France's most decorated and renowned chefs, with three Michelin stars to his name, Guy Savoy decided to extend his global portfolio of restaurants with a small, casual bar dedicated to oysters.\nLocated just off the city's famed Champs Elysees, it features just 16 seats and celebrates bivalves and their producers from around France, including Brittany and the Gironde coast.\nL'Huitrade encourages customers to pop in for a quick aperitif, linger for a raw degustation or indeed take some to go.\nOther options include oysters in an escabeche (a citrus marinade), or in jelly, a Savoy signature.\nL'huitrade , 13 rue Troyon, 75017 Paris France;\nPomze\nPomze is a restaurant and shop dedicated to the humble apple: \"une pomme,\" in French.\nIt tells the story of apples from both a French and international perspective, with every culture celebrating them in their own way.\nOr, as they more lyrically put it: \"They are like notes for our musical score, like colors for our palette.\"\nThis means that apples star in every single dish and product they serve, from Brittany fish soup with cider, to a salmon tartare, avocado and apple salad.\nIf you're hankering for meat, then beef fillet comes with pommeau sauce: a mix of apple juice and Calvados, the famous apple brandy from Normandy.\nPomze , 109 Boulevard Hausmann, 75008 Paris France;\nLe Souffle\nSouffle, the notoriously difficult-to-master lightly baked dish made from egg yolks, whites and all manner of flavors, is the focus here in the ritzy heart of the city's 1er arrondissement.\nAmong the dozens of options on the menu are asparagus, foie gras, morel mushrooms or truffles, alongside more adventurous options like beef bourguignon and the Henri IV with mushrooms and chicken.\nDessert fans need not fret -- raspberry, chocolate and liqueur are just some of the sweet options on offer.\nYou can be pretty sure they won't collapse as this place has been making them rise effortlessly since 1961.\nLe Souffle , 36,rue du Mont Thabor, 75001 Paris France;\nWho says baked potatoes can't be fancy?
