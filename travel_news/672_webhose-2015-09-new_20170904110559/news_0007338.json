The first, Superman Ultimate Flight, made its debut in 2012. \nSix Flags Discover Kingdom will launch the green and purple ride in early 2016. — Screen grab from YouTube In a press release, park president Don McCoy said, “The Joker will be the most talked about new coaster in 2016. We are excited to introduce this innovative technology that marries the best of both classic and modern coaster designs to offer our guests an unparalleled and unique experience.” \nAs such, the wood-and-steel ride will take after the Joker’s unpredictable personality: it will have 3,200 feet of purple and green track, as well as chaotic twists and turns involving a Zero G barrel roll, three inversions, 15 airtime moments and a “fake-out” with a unique “breaking-wave turn.” \nThe highlight will be the first-ever \"step-up, under-flip inverted roll\" that takes riders horizontal. \nThe Joker roller coaster will reportedly have a maximum speed of 85kmh. \nBuckle up and enjoy the ride, folks. It’s going to be a wild one. More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T11:38:50.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
