In 1978, the Sharpstown location was the busiest in the entire U-Haul system with more than 60,000 transactions.\nU-Haul companies are always exploring opportunities for growth but sometimes must close or relocate stores for reasons such as economics, demographics, migration trends, physical plant limitations and the presence of other U-Haul stores.\n\"U-Haul considers the surroundings of each store and the circumstances each store faces in serving our communities,\" said Matt Merrill , marketing company president for U-Haul Company of West Houston .\n\"The U-Haul product and service offerings have changed and the Sharpstown location could no longer serve our customers at the level they expect. We are pleased to be able to meet that expectation at two other U-Haul stores within two miles of the closed location, and 15 U-Haul stores within a seven-mile radius.\"\nU-Haul of Sharpstown customers will find a range of moving products and services in the immediate vicinity at U-Haul Moving & Storage of Meyerland Area at 6808 Bissonnet as well as U-Haul Moving & Storage of Westwood at 8015 S. Gessner Road.\nThe Meyerland Area store on Bissonnet offers U-Box containers, hitches and propane in addition to a full lineup of rental trucks, trailers, towing equipment, pre-tow inspection, moving supplies and more. The Westwood store on S. Gessner Road is expanding its self-storage capacity by nearly 100 units, including a number of outside mini-units being added now.\nU-Haul is the industry leader in do-it-yourself moving and self-storage, offering a wide selection of easily accessible Houston locations with 115 U-Haul neighborhood dealers and 32 U-Haul stores and storage centers.\nContact:\nJeff Lockridge , External Communications\nSebastien Reyes , Director of External Communications\nE-mail: jeff_lockridge@uhaul.com\nPhone: 602-760-4941\nWebsite: uhaul.com\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150925/270736\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090622/LA34860LOGO-b\n releases/u-haul-of-sharpstown-closes-in-houston-300149041.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150925/270736", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090622/LA34860LOGO-b", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/u-haul-of-sharpstown-closes-in-houston-300149041.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20090622/LA34860LOGO-b", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LA11784&Transmission_Id=201509251130PR_NEWS_USPR_____LA11784&DateId=20150925", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150925/270736"], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T20:18:37.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
