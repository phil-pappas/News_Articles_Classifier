The improvement in U3 is incredibly massive. U3 still follows the original principle of design—attentiveness to the details. United States, 21 September 2015 -- FOSJOAS is under Moben Global Inc., which was established in the year of 2010. On its erection, Moben Global Inc. formally enter the already-fiercely competitive market for scooter. At the same time, Moben Global Inc. pushed out FOSJOAS as its core brand of scooter. It is 5 years since Moben Global Inc. rolled out its first model, i.e. the twin-wheeled self-balancing scooter V3. Up to now, Moben Global Inc. has released a variety of electric self-balancing scooters, for example V5, V6 and V9. Months ago, Moben Global Inc. once again unveiled another revolutionary model U3, an upgraded version of two-wheeled scooter. FOSJOAS two-wheeled intelligent scooter U3 is a refined version of the previous two-wheeled scooter V9. When the electric self-balancing scooter V9 saw the light of the day, it caused a sensation in the whole sector. Thousands of scooter-lovers were out to panic-buy V9. V9 can be termed as an innovative and revolutionary model, for it ushered in the age of two-wheeled scooter. It broke the monopoly of the single-wheeled scooter. The current U3 is based on FOSJOAS intelligent self-balancing scooter V9. Being the predecessor of U3, V9 serves as the prelude to the advent of U3. The improvement in U3 is incredibly massive. U3 still follows the original principle of design—attentiveness to the details. Unlike its predecessor V9, U3 are outfitted with a side-mounted fender. Almost all riders of V9 and U3 regard the speed of them. However, when they ride them through the muddy path, the splashed mud tend to dirty their adorable scooter. At this, they feel a shade regretful. As such, the side-mounted fender is installed on FOSJOAS intelligent self-balancing scooters, which is a help to shield the scooter from the spattered mud.The roaring success of U3 cannot go without the contribution made by V9. V9 paves the way for the arrival of U3. No V9, no U3. # # #", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T22:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T12:04:54.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
