Picture: REUTERS Related articles Costolo’s wish for Twitter Your Twitter feed is set to start autoplaying videos In this article Companies and organisations: Twitter TWITTER is contemplating whether to allow users to tweet more than 140 characters at a time, a debate that challenges one of the fundamental features of the social media service.\nInterim CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey is spearheading a project code-named \"140 Plus,\" which is looking at different ways users can extend its signature 140-character limit, according to people familiar with the matter.\nThe final version isn’t set.\nThere has been continuing debate at the company about what to do about the limit, a feature unique to Twitter that has created its own lingo and quirky style of brevity but has had its obvious constraints.\nUsers have come up with workarounds to the character limitation by attaching screenshots of longer text or by linking tweets together in a so-called \"tweetstorm\".\nOne of the main issues the company is grappling with is by how much it should extend the limit and how that should look, a decision that could alter the basic Twitter experience, these people said.\nOne camp is in favour of simply increasing it by 10 or so characters, while another camp would rather take the time to devote resources to building a rich publishing platform that could perhaps be monetised one day. What that platform would look like is unclear.\nMuch of this debate is happening in the midst of a transition on the product team.\nJeff Seibert, who earlier this month was put in charge of Twitter’s consumer products, is working to alter the process in which product features are being developed, according to one of the people. Rather than piecemeal tests that lead to incremental product launches, Twitter is committing time and resources for changes that are in line with a broader vision.\nA Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment.\nMr Dorsey, who is the leading candidate to become the permanent CEO at Twitter even as he maintains his chief executive role at Square Inc, has been pushing the company to rethink fundamental components about the social media service as it tries to jump-start sagging user growth.\nDespite a flurry of product tweaks over the past year, Twitter has struggled to appeal to the average internet user.\nTwitter has tried to make the service easier to use by offering a summary of the best tweets users missed while they were away and by cutting down on the time it takes to sign up for Twitter.\nDuring the company’s earnings call in July, Mr Dorsey said using Twitter should \"be as easy as looking out your window to see what’s happening\".\nAt the same time, \"Twitter also has to be the most powerful microphone in the world.\"\nTwitter is getting ready to launch the much-anticipated Project Lightning, a curated feed of tweets, photos and video around live events.\nThe new feature will help highlight content that gets lost in Twitter’s trademark fire hose of tweets found in the main feed.\nTwitter and its rivals are increasingly battling to become major media-distribution platforms, while experimenting with longer-form content. Facebook recently launched a new feature called \"Instant Articles\" that lets publishers distribute content through the social network, and it is also testing new tools that appeal more to bloggers.\nThe latter Notes feature puts Facebook in competition with Medium, a blogging platform started by Twitter co-founder Evan Williams that on Monday said it raised $57m in new funding.\nTechnology news site Re/code earlier reported news of Twitter’s plan to change the 140-character limit.\nMore Africa news from The Wall Street Journal\nMore news from The Wall Street Journal\nPremium access to WSJ.com: $1 a week for 12 weeks", "external_links": ["http://online.wsj.com/public/page/news-africa.html?mod=TMGSAlink1", "https://join.wsjeuropesubs.com/tmg1", "http://online.wsj.com/europe?mod=TMGSAlink2", "https://www.wsjeuropesubs.com/wsj12offer/?tagsrc=/tmg1&rnd=54622c7ae7d81"], "published": "2015-09-30T22:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:48:45.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
