It doesn't have extreme tourist activities, restaurants are far from Michelin-starred, and hotel choices are quite limited - there's one. \nThe island was my final stop on a seven-night Hawaiian tour with Un-Cruise Adventures, and followed days at huge tourism destinations, including the stunning Manele Bay on Lana'i and the party town of Lahaina. While the other sojourns set us down on beautiful foreshores and picturesque harbours, my first impression of Molokai was, well, not good. There was a desolate-looking, industrial port with a bland backdrop. A shoreline, but no obvious beach. A drive through the town didn't really improve matters, with broken cars and run-down infrastructure among the main sights. \nLooking out at Hawaii from Molokai.

For whatever reason, Molokai also appears to have turned its back on tourism, thwarting any efforts that might entice travellers to visit. But, and it's a significant but, this \"friendly island\" has heart. Honolulu has glitz, Maui is island cool, but Molokai is a place to experience long-established Hawaiian culture. \nIn an effort to give visitors a chance to mix with locals, Un-Cruise arranged a visit to a family in Halawa Valley on the eastern end of the island. \nPilipo Solatorio, 75, is a cherished Kapuna (elder) and one of the last Hawaiians born, raised and still living in the valley. He invited us into his home and spoke about the history of the area. \nThe visit followed traditional Hawaiian protocol, which for any New Zealander is like visiting a marae in a parallel universe. Everything you know about Maori culture is there, but with a twist. Our group was called on to the property by the sound of Conch shell, and we responded with our own.

Solatorio spoke to us about the taro-farming lifestyle of the family, describing day-to-day life in the commune-like valley. He talked about the 1946 tsunami that hit his village, and his hopes that we would share our experience of Halawa Valley with the world. His son, Greg, gave us a demonstration of how to pound taro into poi - a local food that, truthfully, I'm not jumping to try again. \nAnother unique aspect of Molokai is Kalaupapa, a former leper settlement on the northern side of the island. \nLooking out at Halawa Valley on Hawaii's Molokai island. Photo: NATHAN BROWN \nFrom 1866 to 1969, people diagnosed with leprosy were exiled to the colony by the Hawaiian government and legally declared dead. \nThe peninsula is now Kalaupapa National Historical Park, and to be permitted into the area you need to be part of an official tour. But if you're after more information, the (very) modest Molokai Museum can provide it. During my visit, there was a photographic exhibition profiling former patients, and the people now living in Kalaupapa. \nAnd then there was the was the food. Surely the core of every culture. \nMy visit to the museum doubled as a pa'ina (feast), where, among a variety of other dishes, I tried Imu Kalua Pua, pork cooked on hot stones underground; Squid Luau, saut√©ed taro leaves with coconut and octopus; Limu, a seaweed salad; and Hapuia, a sticky pudding. \nAs our driver remarked on the way back to the boat: \"Hawaiians don't eat till they're full, they eat till they're tired.\" \nThe author travelled courtesy of Un-Cruise Adventures ( un-cruise.com/ ), and with assistance from Cruise World ( specials.cruiseworld.co.nz/ ).
