Four Seasons and Elaya Vaughn collaborated to create three distinct vignettes to showcase how the same wedding can be reinvented three ways, from food to fashion and décor. Opulent, Timeless, and Ethereal styles were the inspiration behind the event:\nThe Opulent look featured Elaya Vaughn’s voluminous Aela gown with ornate crystal beading along the neckline. To showcase the trend of custom beverages, Four Seasons developed three punch recipes. For the opulent wedding, there was an Elderflower Champagne Cocktail with an edible flower garnish in crystal coupe glasses, accompanied by a large crystal punch bowl on a beautiful vintage gold bar cart.\nThe Timeless, sophisticated bride was dressed in Elaya Vaughn’s sleek long sleeve crocheted lace Nikki gown with a plunging back. For this look, Four Seasons demonstrated the trend of incorporating existing venue furniture into the wedding’s design and décor by setting up to-go desserts on china cabinet shelves. This not only made for a beautiful display, but also re-purposed the furniture.\nElaya Vaughn’s Callie airy organza gown – for the Ethereal bride – boasted a romantic trailing cathedral train, covered in silk petals. The event marked the launch of the Hotel’s in-house wedding cakes, which will be customised to match each couple’s style. Executive Pastry Chef Scott Gerken and his team used the Callie gown as inspiration for the ethereal wedding cake – fresh roses cascaded down the side, lustre dust was sprinkled throughout, and soft designs covered the lemon cake tiers. Guests enjoyed mini versions of each wedding cake that were creatively displayed throughout the three vignettes.\nThe Flower Firm, a local event production company, incorporated the trend of living walls, complete with lush florals, plants, and suspended blooms.\nIt was a night to remember for Four Seasons Hotel Chicago and Elaya Vaughn as the city looks forward to the 2016 wedding season, and to introducing trends, unique offerings and creativity to new couples.\nSource:- Four Seasons Hotels & Resort", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T13:32:45.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
