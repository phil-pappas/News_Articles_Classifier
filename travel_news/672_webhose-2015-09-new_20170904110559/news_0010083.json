Members of the company's HHonors program also will be to use a digital guide of restaurants and nightlife spots most frequented by Uber riders.\nThe companies plan to launch this option later this month in 20 U.S. cities as a feature within the Hilton HHonors mobile app.\nUber connects riders and drivers through a smartphone application and has launched in more than 300 cities.\nIt's a staple of the rapidly growing \"sharing economy\" that involves newer businesses that aim to use the Internet to make it easier for people to earn money by sharing property like cars or homes. Businesses like Airbnb, which arranges for people to rent rooms or apartments, have faced opposition from traditional service providers that complain about being undercut.\nTerms of the deal between Hilton and Uber were not disclosed.\nMcLean, Virginia-based Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.'s brands include Embassy Suites, Hampton Inn, and Homewood Suites.\nShares of Hilton slipped 30 cents, or 1.2 per cent, to $24.53 in early trading Tuesday, as broader indexes also fell. The hotel chain's stock had slipped nearly 5 per cent so far this year, as of Monday's market close.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T12:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T18:12:35.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
