The US Forest Service center will be open on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from 10 a.m. until 4.p.m. until March 27, 2016. The visitor center is closed on federal holidays during winter. There is no charge during winter. \nDuring the winter the Forest Service will re-open the Discovery Zone , an educational-play area for children and their families within the visitor center building. The centerâ€™s 15-minute film, Landscape of Change , is played on request when the center is open. \nThe US Forest Service hosts special family events in the visitor center during the winter, including the popular winter Fireside Lecture series which begins January 8, 2016. Programs will occur twice nightly on Friday evenings during January, February and March at 6:30 p.m. and 8 p.m. \nBears continue to use the visitor center area so the Forest Service asks dog owners to keep pets on a leash and respect the needs of wildlife to forage on wild foods in preparation for hibernation, which begins in November. \nFor more information, call the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center at 907-789-0097.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T00:24:14.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
