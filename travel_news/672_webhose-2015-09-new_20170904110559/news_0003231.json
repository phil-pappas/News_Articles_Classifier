Calaveras oiling up chain saws for Lumberjack Day 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nIf you’re a small logging town in the foothills somewhere between Sutter Creek and Lake Tahoe, how do you honor your heritage? You might very well celebrate Lumberjack Day, from early in the morning until late at night. That’s just what West Point, off Highway 88 in Calaveras County, has been doing for 41 years. Festivities include a parade, a car show, a rock wall and other activities for kids, vendors, and plenty of food and drink. But all those things are just a warm-up for the serious business of putting big timber, chainsaw and ax-wielding skills to the test. \nVitals: Oct. 3, \n7 a.m.-10 p.m.; parade at 11 a.m. $5. Main Street and other West Point locations. (209) 293-4259. www.lumberjackday.org. \nSonoma Music Festival debut: The B.R.
