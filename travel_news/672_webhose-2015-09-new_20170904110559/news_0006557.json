These conferences, meetings, consumer shows and trade shows will have attracted nearly 47,000 participants and business tourists to the city, who will have booked 41,000 room nights in Montréal hotels. These events will contribute over $64.2 M to Montréal’s and Québec’s economy. \n“As the top host city in the Americas for international conventions according to the Union of International Associations and a convention centre gold certified by the AIPC Quality Standards program, Montréal and the Palais are both well positioned internationally, while continuing to create significant economic and intellectual wealth for all of Québec,” says Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Société du Palais des congrès de Montréal. The year’s events – both already hosted and upcoming – include the 45th Annual Scientific Meeting of the International Continence Society, which will be attended by 2,000 delegates. Dr. Jacques Corcos, appointed Emeritus Ambassador for his active role in bringing the event to Montréal, adds: “Organizing a convention of this magnitude makes it possible to showcase the range and scope of our city’s expertise in the field of urology by scheduling activities rich in scientific content and fostering opportunities for colleagues from all over the world to share information.” For his part, Dr. François Audibert, appointed Ambassador for his involvement with the 25th World Congress of the International Society for Ultrasound In Obstetrics and Gynecology, states: “The level of personal and professional recognition that stems from convening thousands of specialists together is significant, while the event itself enables Montréal to maintain its reputation as among the best centres for specialized medicine.” According to Montréal In Vivo, a cluster-based economic development organization, Greater Montréal ranks 6th among the largest metropolitan regions in North America for concentration of life science and health technology jobs. This sector alone accounts for 1.5% of Québec’s GDP, i.e. an amount totalling $5.3 billion. Life science related events represent 39% of the international conventions held at the Palais des congrès, making it the top sector from among the major events hosted at the Palais. The aerospace, transportation, environmental and energy sectors are among the other sectors well represented on the Palais event calendar. In addition to hosting events, the Palais des congrès is also actively involved in putting together events, including two new life science related conventions: the International Forum on Health (2013-2014), developed by Palais Ambassador Dr. Fabrice Brunet, and the International Congress on Personalized Health Care. The latter, scheduled for June 12 to 14, 2016, is one of the initiatives born out of the Je fais Montréal project. The President of the Palais Ambassadors Club, Dr. Pavel Hamet, and the Executive Director of the Quebec Network for Personalized Health Care, Dr. Daniel Bouthillier, started the promising initiative, which is expected to draw over 1,000 multidisciplinary specialists for the purpose of sharing ideas, projects and resources dedicated to the development of personalized medicine so it may occupy a frontline medical role.
