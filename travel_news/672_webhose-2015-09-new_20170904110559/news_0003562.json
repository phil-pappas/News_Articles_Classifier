They like to stay in high end hotels, with good internal transport facilities, an area where Australia has not been concentrating enough in this period.\nAustralia is the number one holiday destination for intending Chinese tourists in terms of awareness, aspiration and intention to travel but that intention does not convert to reality.\nThe airline capacity and transport needs to be improved. The hotels will have to be developed. There are not many sign boards in foreign languages; the visa regulations may not be competitive enough.\nThe surge of the new millionaire Chinese travellers is increasing and their lust for luxury travel and stay is making them choosy. So it is important to build proper infrastructure to draw them towards Australia. Since other countries are making it easy for people to come and visit not just once but multiple times.\nAccording to experts China would be the key market for the next 30 years but also that China was “shorthand” for the broader Asian region, which will also generate wealthy tourists as more people move into the middle class.\nHowever Australia is coming up with a great project to whet the Chinese appetite.
