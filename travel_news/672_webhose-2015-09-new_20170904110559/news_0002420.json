Brooks For the Mercury News Posted: 09/21/2015 12:00:00 PM PDT Over the past several decades, just a few brewers have tried opening a craft brewery on Maui, and few have succeeded. But this year marks the 10th anniversary of Garrett and Melanie Marrero's Maui Brewing Co. What began with a brewpub in Lahaina, the touristy beach town, soon grew to include a separate production brewery to produce beer in cans. \nBrewmaster Garrett grew up in San Diego, where his beer-loving grandfather introduced him to microbrews, imports and home-brewing. Garrett's career path may have started in finance and investment consulting, but a Maui vacation in 2001 derailed his plans. He fell in love with the Hawaiian island and decided he would eventually open a brewery there. \nMaui Brewing makes four flagship beers, all in cans and all brewed year-round. Bikini Blonde Lager is a refreshing helles that's light-bodied for the climate but still full-flavored. Big Swell IPA is aimed at hop lovers, and Mana Wheat is an unfiltered American wheat ale brewed with -- what else? -- pineapple. For the more adventurous, there's a CoCoNut PorTeR, brewed with toasted coconut, which gives it an amazing and very different taste profile, with hints of chocolate, coffee and, of course, loads of coconut flavor. \nThe brewery also does limited releases; other breweries call those seasonals, but since there's only one season in Hawaii, they decided \"limited release\" made more sense. The latest one -- for fall -- is Doppel Shot Double Bock, a doppelbock with strong coffee notes. Recent past releases have included a Lorenzini Double IPA and Kihei Kolsch. The brewpub also offers 60 different beers.

Last year, they added a new 40,000-square-foot production brewery -- and sold the old one to what will become Maui's second brewery, Kohola Brewery, which hopes to open later this year. Maui Brewing's new facility is in Kihei, located (conveniently) just 30 minutes south of the airport. The tasting room is open from 11 a.m.-10 p.m. daily, with a rotating array of food trucks. A Maui Brewing restaurant is scheduled to open in early 2017. And the brewery offers tours as well; reservations are recommended. \nSince moving into the new digs, the brewery has increased production by 75 percent, and six new fermenters are due to arrive shortly to keep up with demand. \nSoon, Maui Brewing will have a new spot on Oahu, right in the heart of Waikiki. Maui Brewing will take over a 20,000-square-foot space at the Waikiki Beachcomber in April, with plans to open in October 2016. They'll operate Maui Brewing Waikiki as a restaurant, serving all their own beers and many exclusive brewpub beers. Eventually, they hope to add a pilot brewery so they can create unique beers for the Oahu location. \nCheers! Contact Jay R. Brooks at BrooksOnBeer@gmail.com .
