The attractionwas first enjoyed by the Edwardians, following its original development in 1902 by visionary railway engineer, Berkeley Deane Wise.\nThe dramatic two-mile long path, part of Northern Ireland’s famous Causeway Coastal Route, consists of a network of walkways, bridges and water-splashed gantries embedded into the black basalt sheer cliff faces.\nDuring its Edwardian heyday, The Gobbins attracted more tourists than The Giant’s Causeway but five decades after launching it fell into disrepair and closed to the public in 1954.\nFollowing significant investment, the magnificently restored attraction is set to become a thriving tourism hub once again. The Gobbins – which takes its name from the Irish ‘An Gobain’, meaning ’the points of rock’ – features a series of both tubular and suspension bridges, replicating the design marvel created by Wise over 100 years ago.\nThe pathway offers an exhilarating walk to awaken the senses, a mix of rugged beauty, spectacular views, heritage, flora and fauna. Nature lovers can get up close and personal with coastal birds such as guillemots and kittiwakes, as well as Northern Ireland’s only mainland colony of puffins.\nWith access by guided tour, The Gobbins journey begins at a state-of-the-art visitor centre, which includes a café and interactive exhibition. Following a safety briefing, walkers are transferred to the cliff path by minibus. Tours begin on the hour, currently from 10am to 3pm daily. The full excursion including the visitor centre can take up to 3-4 hours.\nJust a 40 minute drive from Belfast, The Gobbins coastal path lies at the beginning of the world-famous Causeway Coastal Route and is situated close to the famous Blackhead lighthouse. This geologically diverse Northern Ireland landscape also provides the location backdrop for the hit TV series, Game of Thrones.\nOther popular destinations within the region include The Giant’s Causeway, the Glens of Antrim, Bushmills Distillery, Rathlin Island as well as miles of golden sand.\nThe Gobbins is open daily from 9.30am to 5.30pm with prices starting from £8.50 for adults and £6.00 for concessions. Pre-booking is recommended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:03:39.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
