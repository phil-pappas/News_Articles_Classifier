The corn is high, and soon the root vegetables that will make their way onto our fall tables will be here. In New England, the time is just right for a farmers market road trip, which is an immersion into the flavors, colors, music and people of the Northeast. Visiting one really is a getaway in a day.\nLast week I chose one close to my home — the Plymouth Farmers Market (137 Warren Ave.). Set on a sprawling lawn just below historic Plimoth Plantation, the market was busy yet intimate. There was live music and kids games, locally made goat cheese and fresh-picked tomatoes. You could gather everything you need to cook an incredible dinner or have someone prepare one for you. It was like a festival of food and fun. And it happens every week.\nAs I arrived, a friendly attendant pointed out where to park and the easy walk to the market. I parked, grabbed my recycle bags (bring them or a basket) and walked into the bustle of the event. The field was lined along each side with small tents, each filled with all kinds of local­ly sourced products. In the center, children were playing games on colorful mats, guided in their fun by the local Montessori School staff. Nearby a vocalist sang and strummed a guitar. All the booths were offering ready-made meals and snacks. I pondered bringing dinner home, but decided to shop a bit first.\nThe produce itself was worth the trip. I’d been disappointed recently in the peppers and more at the usual market, thinking it must have been a bad season. Not so here. I found crisp, healthy peppers, sweet and ripe raspberries, and sweet watermelon. As I wondered about yellow watermelon, the farmer offered me and others a large slice sample. It was delicious, and I had to buy it. There were also booths offering locally made coffee, goat cheese, pesto (and recipes), gluten-free treats, meats and fresh seafood. Each booth operator had a story to tell, too, and could share the history and information about their products. Oh, they like to chat and chatting with them is half the fun.\nI picked some treats to take home, including some of Jenny’s Bread that folks rave about. Her chocolate rolls are worth a day trip in themselves. For dinner that night, I chose Bramhall’s lobster rolls and a Chariot wood-fired pizza. I noticed many families were ordering various meals and dining al fresco on the lawn. (Note to self: Tell husband to meet me here next time.) While I’d planned on a quick stay, I ended up savoring the event until closing time. With food demonstrations and a friendly atmosphere, it is easy to do. The market takes place Thursdays from 2:30 to 6:30 p.m. and moves indoors at the Plantation for the winter months. You can learn more about the Plymouth Farmers Market at www.plymouthfarmersmarket.org.\nHaving loved my farmers market day trip, I planned to visit more this season, including the North Adams Farmers Market in the Berkshires. It’s a twofold treat — woodsy mountain setting is sublime and the farm offerings are abundant. The market runs from 8 a.m. to noon on Saturdays in St. Anthony’s parking lot — at the intersection of Route 8 (Marshall Street) and St. Anthony Drive — through October. Go to farmfresh.org for a list of what is available weekly. The market also features local restaurants that use locally grown ingredients and feed visitors on-site.\nThe Salem Farmers Market does for the North Shore what the Plymouth Farmers Market does for the South Shore — It brings all kinds of local flavor and products to one lovely seaside-town spot. You’ll find fresh produce of course, but also freshly made clam chowder, fresh fish and — be still our hearts — locally made chocolate. The market runs from 3 to 7 p.m. Thursdays in Derby Square. Details and what’s available each week can be found at salemfarmersmarket.org.\nA trip to a farmers market is a true escape. And a delicious one at that.\nTo find more farmers markets throughout the state, go to massfarmers markets.org.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T07:46:17.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
