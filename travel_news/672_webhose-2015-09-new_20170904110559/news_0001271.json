There are also orchards of apricot, peach and olive trees, and greenhouses of ornamental flowers. \nThe estate's gardens first opened to the public in 2014, with tours organised for groups and by reservation only. \nBut workaholic Francis, who does not take vacations and has only been to the summer palace twice, urged his Museum's director to go further, opening up the entire estate and setting up a new museum. \n'Closed for centuries' \nVisitors to the villa can stand where popes down the centuries stood to bless summer Sunday crowds -- the very window from which Benedict XVI said his last goodbyes before retiring from the papacy. \nAs well as a papal portrait gallery, visitors can pore over embellished vestments worn by the holders of Saint Peter's Chair down the ages, including elegant papal slippers of the type shunned by down-to-earth Francis. \nFor 40 euros ($45), tourists get the full package: they can skip the queue in the morning to see the Vatican Museums and Sistine Chapel in Rome, before walking through the Vatican's gardens to the train station. \nOnce at Castel Gandolfo, they hop on a special white tourist train which takes them around the papal villa, including past the pope's organic farm, which houses cows, free-range hens, cockerels and pontifical bees. \nFrom the train's windows they get a glimpse at the makings of the papal menu: freshly laid eggs, milk, vegetables, fruit, honey and fat rounds of caciotta cheese from the farm often end up on the pope's table back in the Vatican. \nVisitors can then wander around the town of Castel Gandolfo, a mediaeval borough listed among Italy's most beautiful, before getting the train back to the Vatican in the afternoon. \nThere is also a 16 euro option for those who want to skip the Vatican Museums and just do Castel Gandolfo. \nFrugal Francis, who has shunned the Holy See's papal apartments for life in a Vatican hotel, has said he has no time to visit the estate -- a decision, however, which has seen local shopkeepers hit by a drop in tourism. \nThe Argentine hopes that by launching the new link with the summer palace it will revive the struggling businesses. \n\"Seeing as he's unable to spend time at Castel Gandolfo because of his numerous engagements, Francis wanted to make a generous gesture so that we can all visit a place which has been closed for so many centuries,\" Osvaldo Gianoli, director of the Castel Gandolfo villas, told AFP.   0 people liked / 0  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T16:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T12:20:18.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
