Provo Golf Club sets up a booth in the lobby of each venue prior to the show collecting email addresses from attendees to be entered in the draw for the vacation giveaway. With recently being voted the #1 island in the world by TripAdvisor, attendees have been extremely excited about the opportunity to win a free vacation and learning more about the destination. “Our timing of partnering with Feherty, one of the most popular personalities in golf, could not have come at a better time for Provo Golf Club. With interest in visiting the Turks & Caicos at an all-time high and being able to introduce the Regent Grand Resort and Provo Golf Club to David’s fans is great exposure for us and we look forward to attending 15 to 20 more shows in 2016” comments Sean.\n \nProvo Golf Club is looking forward to David’s return to the islands for a quick break in October, when he takes time out of his very busy schedule to meet our members.\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T18:26:16.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
