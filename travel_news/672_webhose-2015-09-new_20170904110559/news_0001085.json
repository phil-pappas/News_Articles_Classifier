These fares can then be branded and made available across the airline’s different sales channels. \nThrough Logitravel’s implementation of Amadeus Fare Families, travellers will benefit from a broader value offering of airline products to choose from, more comparison, as well as the ability to personalise their travel experience. Amadeus Fare Families will be available on Logitravel’s website by early November, when the solution is expected to be fully implemented. Upon completion, consumers will enjoy a similar offering between the OTA’s website and that of airlines pursuing a branded fares strategy. With this implementation, Logitravel continues down its path of innovation in airline merchandising. In April 2015, the OTA implemented Amadeus Ancillary Services, enabling customers to customise their travel experience by purchasing a la carte services offered by airlines, such as extra luggage or preferred seating. To date, 17 airlines have implemented Amadeus Fare Families and close to 80 airlines have already implemented Amadeus Airline Ancillary Services. The numbers continue to grow each month, both on the airline and OTA fronts, asmerchandising assumes a key role in delivering greater choice to consumers and generating additional revenues across the industry. Tomeu Bennasar, Managing Director of Logitravel.com, says, “Amadeus’ technology allows us to increase the selection that we offer to our customers, putting us on a par with, or even improving upon, what the airline offers directly. With this new solution we estimate that we will increase our sales between 5 and15%, in addition to offering a more complete service to the traveller.” “Amadeus has, and continues, to invest significantly in merchandising technology so that airlines and travel agencies can align with evolving traveller needs. We are excited to see the traction that Amadeus’ merchandising solutions are enjoying on both the airline and OTA fronts. These solutions are already delivering results and incremental sales across the industry” comments Pedro Espin, Associate Director of Merchandising & Personalisation at Amadeus IT Group.
