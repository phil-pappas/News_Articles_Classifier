Of course, all bridges are not the same. They can be long or short, steel or wood, pedestrian or motorist and so on and so on. But whatever your bridge type may be, here are 10 most awesome bridges around the world -- out of hundreds really -- that you simply must try in this lifetime. \n1. Storseisundet Bridge, aka the \"Drunk Bridge\": Averoy, Norway We love optical illusions, but not the kind that would have us believe we're going to drive straight off the end of a roadway and into the ocean. Norway's Storseisundet is the longest of eight bridges on its Atlantic Road and tickles adventure seekers with an optical illusion that gives the appearance that the bridge drops into an abyss. Another adventurous twist is that inclement weather often blows treacherous gusts of wind and water right across bridge. 2. U Bein Bridge: Mandalay, Myanmar Constructed in 1850, this teakwood bridge is believed to be the oldest of its kind in the world and presents a major check mark for any global nomad's bucket list. Only .75-miles in length, U Bein is nevertheless thrills thanks to worries that some of the pillars are decaying due a fish breeding program introduced into Taungthaman Lake that has caused the water to stagnate. Plans to renovate and revitalize the bridge are currently underway. Related: Warning -- this blog post will give you serious Singapore street food cravings. 3. The 7-mile bridge: The Florida Keys, USA If you've never driven the Overseas Highway connecting mainland Florida to Key West you must book a flight to Miami right now. There are parts of the beautiful stretch of roadway in which the road is so narrow the water practically comes within spitting distance of automobiles, but the main prize is the 7-mile bridge which gives motorists the feeling of floating in the middle of azure Caribbean waters. Be sure and walk at least part of the old 7-mile bridge which stands parallel to it. 4. Rialto Bridge: Venice, Italy This charming bucket list bridge lingers over Venice's romantic Grand Canal and remains a selfie favorite for visiting tourists cruising the city via gondola. It is the oldest of the four bridges spanning the Grand Canal and was designed by architect Antonio da Ponte (Michelangelo was also considered for the job) and completed in 1591. Two inclined and covered ramps (which contain shops) lead up to a central portico offering postcard perfect symmetry. 5. Oakland Bay Bridge: Oakland, California Yup, we tricked you. While the obvious Bay Area bridge to brag about is the Golden Gate, this newly renovated bridge is a stunner and you need to get to it now. It's actually a collection of bridges, a western span connects San Francisco to Yerba Buena Island and an eastern span -- the world's widest -- connects the island to Oakland. Driving this one is a blast but you should also view it from a distance as the \"Bay Lights\" are a sight to behold at night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T16:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T17:07:00.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
