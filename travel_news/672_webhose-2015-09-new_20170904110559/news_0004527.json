As it is incorporated in Austria, it is not subject to German labor agreements reached through collective bargaining.\nLufthansa argues that it needs to reduce costs in order to fight off competition from budget air carriers such as Easyjet and Ryanair.\nThe latest walkout was the 13th by pilots represented by VC in the space of 18 months.\nThe cost of the strikes to the airline, according to Lufthansa has been more than 300 million euros ($334 million) over the past two years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:04:21.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
