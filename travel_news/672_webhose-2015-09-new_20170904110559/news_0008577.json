He obviously refered to many problems and issues faced by the once-grand and Maharaja airline, and pride of India. \nLohani told a welcome meet organised by the Indian Association of Tour Operators that it was a challenge and he required all the good wishes to bring back the sheen in the airline. \nThe former head of Madhya Pradesh Tourism, who spent time in Tourism Ministry and is a Railway Mechanical engineer, is known for delivering goods and is effective in implementation. \nHe said that the basics of Air India were sound and he hoped to turn around the ailing Star Alliance carrier. \nVinod Zutshi, the new Secretary in the Ministry of Tourism lauded the role of IATO in tourism promotion. \nHe said that what was required was a coordinated, integrated approach and involving all the stakeholders. He would try to do this, he assured.
