ANA Mileage Club members can earn a mile for every $2 spent with DUFL and then use their miles for domestic or international flights, rental cars or for shopping at a wide range of stores, restaurants, hotels and much more worldwide.\n \nDUFL is a premium travel service that functions as a personal valet; packing, cleaning and storing business attire and then shipping it to the user’s specified destination. When customers are gearing up for a business trip, they can use the DUFL app to select which clothes they want to bring from their virtual DUFL closet, enter a destination and arrival date and their professionally packed DUFL suitcase will be waiting at the hotel when the customer arrives. When it’s time to go home, customers simply schedule a pickup via the app and leave the bag at the hotel’s front desk, traveling home bag-free. DUFL picks the bag up and delivers it to their secure warehouse, where the customer’s clothes will be inventoried, photographed, cleaned and stored in the customer’s virtual closet until they are ready for their next trip.\n \nANA is the only airline in Japan that has SKYTRAX’s highest 5-star rating and an unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction and innovation. ANA is a member of the Star Alliance global airline network, which means that members can earn miles when flying with any of the 27 member airlines. ANA Mileage Club members can start earning additional miles with DUFL by accessing the DUFL partner site. Once connected, when ANA Mileage Club members use DUFL services, they automatically accrue miles for dollars they spend using DUFL, miles that can be redeemed for a wide variety of rewards.

Users can be more productive on the road while gaining back personal time spent preparing for a trip and now those same travelers can earn miles with their favorite loyalty program.”\n \n“DUFL is making life easier for business travelers with a disruptive new service, so we’re excited about introducing ANA Mileage Club members to this new option with an alliance that lets them earn valuable miles when using DUFL,” says Takeshi Inada, Vice President Loyalty Marketing of ANA. “We’re sure our frequent business travelers will enjoy having a virtual closet they can pack via an app or online and a virtual valet to handle their baggage. This is just the beginning of our alliance with DUFL, and we look forward to working with them to deliver additional benefits to our members.”\n \nSource:- DUFL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T18:43:34.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
