But he received a whopping $9 million instead.\n\"I knew we had a great idea, that we'd maybe get a million or two, but never $9 million ,\" Sanghavi told CNN Money.\nThe jacket comes in a wide range colors and styles. Shoppers can buy a sweatshirt, windbreaker, bomber or blazer version of the jacket, according to the Kickstarter page. It is available for preorder and should be ready to ship by the winter travel season.\n“We are perfectionists!” the Kickstarter page reads. “We have done our homework, so the risks are minimal. We have identified and locked in our manufacturers who will be able to ship within 60 days of successful project funding, so you can enjoy your very own BauBax Jackets before the winter travel season kicks in.”\nSanghavi told CNN he hopes to have the jacket in retail stores next year.\nSince the jacket saves space, includes a neck pillow and comes with gloves attached to the sleeves, it will help frequent travelers avoid costs on carrying extra bags or buying pillows and eye masks from airlines, according to the Kickstarter page.\nBut this isn’t the only way frequent flyers can save some money this fall.\nIn fact, this fall might be a good time to go on a trip, as prices are 9 percent cheaper than they were last year and 11 percent cheaper than in 2013 , according to Fortune. Some international flights have dropped between 11 and 29 percent in price compared to last year, Fortune reported.\n\"Based on our analysis of airfares to popular destinations, we've found the average traveler is saving $106 by booking flights in September instead of August ,\" Chris Slowe, Hipmunk's chief data scientist, told NBC News.\nIn fact, the best time to book a flight this fall is in the first two weeks in November, when the average airline price will be $262. Fares will increase closer to Thanksgiving, NBC news reported.\nFrontier Airlines is offering $1 flights for fall trips (though the cheapest flight costs $15 after all your taxes and fees), according to Time magazine. Of course, many of the $1 flights have sold out. All that remain are flights for at least $29, Time reported.\nStill, shoppers should be cautious of the deal, since it only includes one-way tickets, Time reported.\n“Bear in mind that these are one-way prices, and availability at the lowest rates is extremely limited for travel dates this autumn,” Time magazine reported. “It’s possible that fares could be much higher in one direction or the other on your preferred dates.”\nTime also said it’s important to look around to multiple vendors to make sure you’re getting the right deal.\nMilan experiencing a...
