From selecting the topics and speakers that will form the event’s educational content to utilising the latest registration and social media technology, visitors pre-registering will be asked to participate in advance in order to maximise their experience on the day. \nEvent Tech Live is promising a packed programme for the 2015 show, including keynote sessions on the main stage, two ‘Campfire’ areas and the return of the popular Tech Demo stage, with the vast majority of the content chosen by the event’s audience via crowd sourcing. The organiser has already began accepting submissions and has put a call out for 60 second video pitches that will be subject to a public vote. In addition AMP Events has also partnered with N200 and GleanIn to adopt the latest visitor registration technology for the event. This includes showing visitors, as they register, which fellow registrants, exhibitors brands and stand personnel they are connected to via social media, enabling them to reach out and make contact ahead of the event. “It’s important to us that we build upon the success we achieved in 2014. Therefore continuing the unique format, engaging with our visitors and integrating as much event technology as we possibly can features heavily in our plans for 2015,” explains AMP Event’s commercial director, Adam Parry. “We want everyone who invests time in the event to gain as much from the experience as possible, whether that is knowledge, networking or discovering new products and services.” Perfect for event professionals interested in the latest innovations, technologies and software to assist them in the planning and delivery of their events, Event Tech Live will take place at the Old Truman Brewery on 11th November 2015.From corporates, agencies and meeting planners to festival directors, conference and exhibition organisers, anyone involved in organising events should attend, to register please visit http://bit.ly/ETLREG .
