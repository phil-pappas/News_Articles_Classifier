After 07:50, the line will reopen between London Marylebone and Aylesbury Vale Parkway and between London Marylebone and Princes Risborough. The line will remain closed between Princes Risborough and Banbury and a bus replacement service will be in operation. Customers travelling north of Banbury to London are advised to travel on our service to Oxford for a First Great Western service to London Paddington.\nSunday 13 September\nThe line will be closed between Princes Risborough and Banbury all day. A bus replacement service will operate between Princes Risborough and Banbury and between Princes Risborough and Stratford-upon-Avon. Customers travelling from Kings Sutton during this time should use help point. After approx 1225, customers travelling from north of Banbury to London can travel on our service to Oxford for a First Great Western service to London Paddington.\nRob Brighouse, Managing Director at Chiltern Railways said: “This is our next milestone in running services between Oxford Parkway and London Marylebone in October. The new rail line will bring significant social, economic and environmental benefits to those living and working along the route and will be the first new rail link between a major British city and London for over 100 years. As ever, we are working closely with Network Rail to keep closures to an absolute minimum. I’d like to thank customers for their patience whilst this work is undertaken and recommend that customers check their journey carefully.”\nAndy Milne, Senior Programme Manager at Network Rail, said: “The completion of signalling testing is a significant milestone for the project and will allow Chiltern Railways to run its new service from Oxford Parkway to London Marylebone. It is also a real step forward in reconnecting the railway from Oxford and Bicester towards Bletchley, Milton Keynes and Bedford. The £320 million project is being delivered in a ground-breaking, collaborative partnership between Network Rail, Chiltern Railways and our supply chain partners”.\nWork on this project is taking place through a partnership between Network Rail and Chiltern Railways who are managing delivery of the project through the Bicester to Oxford Collaboration. Chiltern Railways has invested £130 million to build the stations and line.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:20:05.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
