A spokeswoman for the Chamber of Mines, which represents Glencore, Anglo American Coal and Exxaro, said the coal producers had raised their offer to wage hikes of up to 8.5% for the lowest-paid workers, from 8% previously.\nInflation is currently running at 4.6%. About 30,000 workers could take part in the strike by the NUM. Two smaller unions which represent mostly skilled workers and supervisors accepted the coal offers last week.\nLike other mining sectors, coal has been hard hit by sliding commodity prices in the face of slowing Chinese growth, while power and labour costs in SA have been rising sharply in recent years.\nBut SA’s mine workers have been growing increasingly militant amid perceptions that wages for the mostly black labour force remain too low two decades after the end of apartheid rule.\nEskom said it only had enough coal to last up to a month.\n“Most of our power stations have a 30 day supply of coal, if the strike goes beyond that period, we will have to make another plan,” Eskom’s spokesman Khulu Phasiwe told Reuters.\nOne option would be to truck coal directly from the mines to power stations.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:41:58.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
