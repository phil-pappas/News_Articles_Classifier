Credit What Took You So Long.org \nAdvertisement The Spanish-born chef José Andrés, 46, has 21 restaurants around the country and in Puerto Rico, including the hot-ticket Minibar in Washington, D.C. Lately, however, it’s his love for Haiti that is getting attention. Mr. Andrés is the host of the new PBS one-hour special “Undiscovered: Haiti With José Andrés,” in which he explores the Caribbean island, sometimes with friends like former President Bill Clinton accompanying him. The idea for the documentary, which is appearing on PBS stations this fall, came about when Mr. Andrés visited Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake in 2010. Since then, he has returned more than 20 times. Below are edited excerpts from a conversation with Mr. Andrés. Q. What was so unforgettable about your first trip to Haiti, and how did that trip lead to this documentary? A. I loved the bustling streets of Port-au-Prince, the untouched coastlines and pristine beaches, the mountains and the lush forests. It’s a fascinating place, but most people relate it to the earthquake, poverty and other challenges. So I said, let’s change that and show the world the real Haiti. My hope is that through this documentary, people will see the country from a different, positive perspective and want to visit. Photo José Andrés. Credit Scott Robinson for The New York Times After your first trip, you established the nonprofit World Central Kitchen to help Haitians feed themselves. How exactly does it do that? We empower five different communities around the country by giving them smart solutions to hunger. A big goal is to educate them about clean cookstoves, which use solar and natural gas. In Haiti, when people use clean cooking fuels instead of firewood, they’re preserving forests, farming and fishing industries because when they use too much wood, deforestation happens, then rains come and wash away the soil farmers would use. We also teach people how to cook so they can feed themselves sustainably and have a network of volunteer chefs from the United States and from Haiti who go into these communities and give lessons. Given that you’re a chef, food is a big focus of the documentary. What are your favorite dishes? I have so many, like the djon-djon mushroom, especially with chicken. It’s a wild, earthy mushroom that gives the dish a deep black color and intense flavor. Then there’s a traditional soup called joumou, which is made of pumpkin and fried pork called griot. To drink, I like akasan, made of corn and coconut milk. It’s almost like a warm milkshake. Besides food, what are your top adventures in the country that viewers can see in the documentary? \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T21:55:58.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
