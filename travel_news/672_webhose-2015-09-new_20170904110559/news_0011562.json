Martin Glenn warned the FAs of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland that “political pressure” would be brought to bear in order to resurrect the concept. Glenn revealed David Cameron had quizzed England’s Women’s World Cup heroes about the saga during a Downing Street reception to recognise their historic third-place finish at this summer’s tournament in Canada. That was after the Scottish Football Association, Football Association of Wales and Irish Football Association blocked the FA’s plan to enter both men’s and women’s Team GB squads at next year’s Olympics in Rio following their one-off appearance at London 2012. Glenn said: “We presented the ladies football team to David Cameron after their return from the semis and the question was raised there at Downing Street, ‘What’s the next tournament?’ “The women said, ‘Oh, it’s the Olympics but we can’t do it’, and Cameron rightly asked the question, ‘Well, why can’t we?’. “The answer was that it was not in our gift and it was too late then, so we agreed that rather spinning our wheels on something that wasn’t going to change, we’d sit down with the other associations and try and get a consensus for 2020 on women.” Glenn, who ruled out talks over entering a men’s team at the 2020 Games in Tokyo, bemoaned the refusal of the other home nations to sanction a women’s side for Rio. “It’s a huge loss,” he said, insisting he understood their fears the concept could endanger their status as separate nations within Fifa. But, citing the importance of the Olympics within the women’s game, he added: “I wish we had had more time to persuade the Welsh, Northern Irish and Scots this would be a better thing but we are going to try really hard and there is going to be a lot of political pressure to make sure it happens in 2020.” Roy Hodgson held clear-the-air talks with the Martin Glenn over the Football Association chief executive’s refusal to award the England manager a new contract before the European Championship, it has emerged. Glenn reiterated on Wednesday that Hodgson’s fate would be determined by how the country performs next summer, declaring the FA wanted to avoid a repeat of the “unsavoury” fallout from their 2010 World Cup flop, prior to which Fabio Capello was handed a new deal. Hodgson has held clear the air talks with Glenn Hodgson first learnt he would be left in limbo on the eve of July’s draw for the next World Cup in St Petersburg, when Glenn announced the FA’s position without having consulted the 68-year-old. As well as being taken by surprise, the England manager went on to question the decision, expressing fears over the “speculation” that would ensue. But Glenn claimed on Wednesday the pair had become “totally joined at the hip” on the issue prior to qualification being secured for Euro 2016. Speaking at the Soccerex Global Convention, Glenn said: “I’ve spoken to him, we had a drink together and it’s sorted, and there’s just not an issue. “All we’re doing now is saying, ‘Right, how do we make this team successful in the Euros?’ There’s no discussion about contracts. “He knows, for his reputation, for England’s reputation, a great Euros is important.” The FA decided not to sack Hodgson after he oversaw England’s earliest ever exit from a World Cup finals last summer. “I’ve learnt as much from failures as I have successes,” Glenn said. “I think Roy’s of that ilk and I think we took a good long-term view.” But that will not involve repeating the mistakes of the past, which saw Capello handed a lucrative new contract days before the 2010 World Cup. The FA stuck with Hodgson despite a poor showing in Brazil “What we wanted to avoid is the slightly unsavoury position we had with Fabio Capello at the end of the World Cup, where it clearly didn’t work,” Glenn said. The former Walkers and Birds Eye supremo reiterated he felt the “tension” created by tournament-to-tournament contracts would improve performances. Asked how England would need to fare in France for Hodgson to earn a new contract, Glenn replied: “You could get to the quarters, have a shocking refereeing decision, the team having played well. “It’s not a strict criteria where it has to be a particular place in the tournament. It’s how we think the team’s progressing and laying the foundation for the World Cup.” Glenn insisted he had not been scouting alternatives in case the worst happened, adding of Hodgson: “I think he’s by far and away the best coach we could have for England.” The FA chief praised the England manager for masterminding a qualifying campaign in which a “young” team has produced eight successive victories. Greg Dyke, the FA chairman, has set the side a goal of winning the 2022 World Cup, something Glenn insisted was achievable – and more. “I love long-term ambitions but, in the long-term, we’re all dead. So we’ve got three tournaments until then,” he said. “We’ll do better in the Euros. I think we’ll do better in Russia.” Greg Dyke is aiming for England to win the 2022 World Cup Glenn also insisted the FA still wanted Premier League clubs to increase the number of home-grown players in their squads in order to help arrest the decline in England-qualified footballers in the division. He revealed Michel Platini, the Uefa president, would raise the issue with the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker in the coming days. But that would appear to be the FA’s only hope of forcing change, with Glenn making it clear he was not prepared to go to war with Premier League executive chairman Richard Scudamore over the matter. “Let’s not pick on this pantomime villain of the Premier League and say that the only thing that’s wrong is the number of home grown players,” he said. Glenn, who joined the FA this summer, defended making 100 people redundant to help fund a grassroots revolution that could also boost playing numbers. “I could smell going into the place that it was very ‘silo-ed’, people didn’t talk to one other, a lot of duplication,” he said. “We’re brutally spending less money on backroom staff and more on getting people playing football.” And he admitted he would be open to further change, even rebranding the organisation to change the perception of England among other football nations as “arrogant”. Asked if the FA should be called the “English FA” to bring it into line with other national associations, Glenn said: “Possibly. But it is not an ultimate priority.” TelegraphSportPage Follow @telefootball Telegraph Fantasy Football 2015/16 Get your first team free. £100,000 to be won Pick your free team »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T20:48:14.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
