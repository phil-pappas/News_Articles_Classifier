Pilots often use cabin locks, prop locks, or throttle locks to deter thieves from breaking into or stealing their aircraft and equipment. However, these measures do not protect against incidental damage nor vandalism.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150917/267791\nIAI introduces, Aero Sentry™, an easy to use, rapidly deployable, affordable, and highly flexible wireless security system that provides unparalleled security for aircraft and aviation infrastructure. Leveraging patented technology developed by IAI for the U.S. Military, Aero Sentry™ is now available for commercial and business aviation applications. Aero Sentry™ consists of four compact radio-frequency transceivers that can be seamlessly integrated with any traffic or safety cone to form a Radio Frequency tripwire. Aero Sentry's 360-degree fisheye camera identifies intruders and accidental events, and communicates with any mobile device, providing alerts of perimeter intrusions events around the aircraft. Never before has aircraft security been so easy and convenient.\nAero Sentry™ is deployed by simply activating the sensors and placing each cone around the aircraft. Aero Sentry™ will send a confirmation upon activation, and continues monitoring the aircraft until the system is deactivated. If any intruders enter the designated secure perimeter, Aero Sentry™ will dispatch a text message or email notification of the intrusion, containing alert data and captured images.\nDon't be a victim of aviation crime.
