(2018) on Abu Dhabi’s Yas Island. \nIn consultancy firm Aecom’s 2013 Theme Park Index, no Middle East venue appeared in the top 25 amusement parks in the world, but experts predict that this trend is set to change. \nPwC Middle East will discuss “UAE’s transformation into a world-class leisure and entertainment destination” as part of the “MEGA Trends” panel at the Vision Conference in Dubai in September, a feature of The Leisure Show 2015. Philip Shepherd, Middle East Hospitality and Leisure Leader at PwC said: “Globally, theme parks in Europe, the Far East and the USA, Orlando in particular, dominate the market. However, theme parks in the UAE have the potential to see over 18 million visits by 2021, versus Hong Kong’s 15m, where venues including Ocean Park and Hong Kong Disneyland and have previously dominated top theme parks in the world lists. With its central global location, and excellent hospitality facilities, we predict the UAE has the potential to become a serious rival to theme park world leader Orlando by 2021.” \nPwC predict ultimate theme park success in the UAE will depend on collaborative working between the Emirates, hotels and attractions to provide a complimentary and complete offering for tourists. \nPhil Taylor, Managing Director of Dubai-based Team Leisure LLC will discuss “Dubai theme parks: boom or bust?” at the Vision Conference. He said: “The region is also experiencing the construction of 3 major museums and 2 safari parks alongside the record-breaking Meydan One mega-project in Dubai reported to be constructing the world’s longest indoor ski slope, and a host of other world-class attractions by 2020. This is arguably the most leisure development currently underway in one location in the world and is a huge undertaking. But if anywhere in the world has the resources, vision and power to pull it off, I believe it is the UAE.” \nAlso in the Vision Conference 2015 a “MEGA Projects – An inside View” session will include 3 major UAE developments: Al Marjan Island, Ras Al Khaimah (Ras Al Khaimah Tourism Development Authority), the Paramount Hotel Dubai (Paramount Hotels & Resorts) and ME Dubai Hotel (Melia Hotels International) with interviews by dmg events Big 5 Editor Gary Wright. \n“The Leisure Show Dubai 2015 has various on the floor demonstrations, features and knowledge theatres, really reflecting the increased activity in the sector,” said Christine Davidson, Group Event Director of the dmg events hospitality and leisure portfolio including The Leisure Show. “The varied product range showcased this year includes bowling alleys (Switch Bowling); entertainment and adventure playground equipment (HPS Middle East and AlQaisar); pool tables and accessories (Interpool); golf simulators (X Golf); pools, spas and saunas (Aqua Middle East); and much more.” \nThe Vision Conference takes place 28-30th September 2015 at the Dubai World Trade Centre, part of The Hotel Show and The Leisure Show, the only events dedicated to cater to the thriving hospitality and leisure industry in the Middle East and Africa.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T11:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T13:52:34.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
