It’s little more than a two-hour flight from the UK, followed by a 30-minute cab ride.\nThe city tests walkers with several steep ascents, but there are funiculars, trams and taxis. Look out for the elaborate tiling (featuring dandyish cherubs) on the side of the Carmo and Carmelitas churches and at the grand Sao Bento station.\nHere are the top reasons why you should head to Porto for a vintage break.\nRomantic: Porto is Portugal’s second largest city and home of port wine, with colourful buildings lining the Douro River\nART : The Serralves Park, a €8 (£6) taxi ride from the city centre, will delight children. There’s a maze, rose garden, giant spade sculpture and pink Art Deco villa with fountains. On Sundays, between 10am and 1pm, entry is free. The Contemporary Art Museum costs extra, serralves.pt .\nARCHITECTURE : The lofty Clerics Tower (250ft) only costs €3 (£2) to climb and offers rooftop views over the city to the mouth of the Douro river, torredosclerigos.pt .\nWATER WONDERS : A 50-minute boat ride from Gaia priced €10 (£7) will ferry you under Porto’s six bridges — one of which, Maria Pia, was built in the 19th century by Gustave Eiffel, of Paris fame.\nBEACH WITHIN REACH : Flop on Gaia’s sands, four miles from the city.\nRELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next New York's autumn collection: Why the Big Apple looks at its...

EAT : Sao Nicolau, off the busy Cais Ribeira. Sit outside and you’ll glimpse the river.\nInside, it’s frenetic, but fun. Fish is a speciality. O’Gaveto, in Matosinhos beside the sea and a 20-minute taxi from the city, is known for its sensational seafood, ogaveto.com .\nDRINK : You can’t come to Porto without tasting its famous fortified wine — even if you try the Chip Dry with tonic and mint (a fashionable, if frowned upon, option).\nAt Taylor’s, in Gaia, you can take a tour with a tasting. Grapes are still handpicked and trodden for four hours by foot. Tours cost €5 (£3.60). Bottles start from €14 (£10) up to €250 (£183) for a vintage, taylor.pt .\nThe intricate detail of the walls and ceiling at the Sao Bento railway station is worth visiting when you are in the city\nCarmelitas Church on the left, decorated in the Mannerist and Baroque styles with Carmo Church on the right\nmore videos 1 2 3 Watch video Moment aggressive driver SLAMS instructor's elbow in door\nWatch video Irate customer at kebab shop melts down over order\nWatch video Rough justice: Street robber caught by victim and choked\nWatch video Sleepover!

Instead, try Armazem on Rua de Miragaia — a selection of shops in an old Customs building with an art gallery and tapas bar.\nTrendy Espaco 7, 133 Rua do Teatro in Foz, by the sea, sells clothing and handbags and has cafe dining.\nSPLASH OUT : The swish Yeatman’s big draw is its views over Porto from all 82 rooms (and bathtubs).\nThe flamboyant hotel is in Gaia, the shadier side of the river where port is stored before being shipped. Watch the curving river Douro at dawn and dusk as the light catches the city.\nThe hotel has a Michelin-starred restaurant and a spa offering vinotherapy. Rooms cost from €200 (£146) a night with breakfast, the-yeatman-hotel.com .\nSAVE: The guesthouse Favorita on Rua Miguel Bombarda, behind the National Art Museum — Soares dos Reis — has a garden and rooms from €60 a night (£44), including breakfast, pensaofavorita.pt .\nTRAVEL FACTS: Plan your own Porto break Scott Dunn (020 8682 5080) offers weekend packages to Porto, including the Yeatman hotel, flights and transfers.\nBA flights from £100 return.\nRead more: scottdunn.com Book Flights, Holidays & Check In Online | British Airways Fundação de Serralves - Serralves Torre dos Clérigos Restaurante O Gaveto Taylor's Port Wine - The Home of Port The Yeatman Hotel in Porto – Luxury Wine Spa Hotel Favorita - Pensão Favorita | Centro Histórico do Porto", "external_links": ["http://the-yeatman-hotel.com/", "http://taylor.pt/", "http://torredosclerigos.pt/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=", "http://pensaofavorita.pt/", "http://dailym.ai/1M1oLG4", "http://britishairways.com/", "http://scottdunn.com/", "http://ogaveto.com/", "http://serralves.pt/"], "published": "2015-09-05T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T19:27:22.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
