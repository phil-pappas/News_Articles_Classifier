He begins the video by saying that many millions of eggs are fertilized that do not end up becoming humans and asks if these have the same rights as every individual. Sometimes fertilized eggs do not attach inside a woman’s womb and pass through the woman’s body.\n \n“If you’re going to hold that as a standard, that is to say if you’re going to say when an egg is fertilized it’s therefore has the same rights as an individual, then whom are you going to sue?” said Nye. “Whom are you going to imprison? Every woman who’s had a fertilized egg pass through her? Every guy who’s sperm has fertilized an egg and then it didn’t become a human? Have all these people failed you? It’s just a reflection of a deep scientific lack of understanding and you literally or apparently literally don’t know what you’re talking about.”\n \nNye is speaking about legislation in the United States that is up for debate. The issue facing politicians is how to address federal funding for Planned Parenthood, an organization which provides reproductive health, maternal, and child health services.\n \n“I know nobody likes abortion, okay. But you can’t tell somebody what to do,” added Nye. “I mean she has rights over this, especially if she doesn’t like the guy that got her pregnant. She doesn’t want anything to do with your genes, get over it, especially if she were raped and all this. So it’s very frustrating on the outside, on the other side. We have so many more important things to be dealing with. We have so many more problems to squander resources on this argument based on bad science, on just lack of understanding.”\n \nThe video has received mixed reaction from the public with some applauding him for standing up for women’s rights, while others call his video a biased opinion. Regardless, Nye tries to bring science to the debate and sway people to use fact over opinion to make their argument about the controversial issue.\n \n \nSource:- Kelowna", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T18:38:09.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
