Narendra Kumar has done an amalgamation of the old-world charm and yet kept it for the new-age Indians.\nRajeev Nangia , director, Monaco Government Tourist Bureau said, “We are targeting the young and new-age Indians who have taste for the best. The Lakme Fashion Week gave us the perfect platform to showcase the destination through Narendra Kumar’s designs. He has blended his collection with the Indian taste but has not compromised on elegance, glamour and opulence which Monaco is known for. We wanted to showcase Monaco to the discerning audience who are inclined towards travelling in style. The destination weddings have become a recent trend among Indians. Monaco has hosted few Indian Weddings in the past. And we want to reach out to the consumers who are looking for newer and luxurious destinations.”\nThe fashion week was witnessed by various people from across the industry and by many renowned fashion designers and celebrities. Speaking on this occasion, Narendra Kumar said, “Monaco encompasses heritage, luxury and elegance – it’s an appropriate collaboration as these characteristics reflect in my own sensibilities interpreted through modern silhouettes combined with traditional craftsmanship and sharp tailoring.”\nThe famous British model and former footballer, Stephen James walked the ramp.
