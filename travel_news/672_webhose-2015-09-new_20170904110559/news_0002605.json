The very scenic European country on the Adriatic Sea records up to 3.5 percent more overnight stays every year. The necessary investments in new hotels and resorts are enormous: After 5.5 billion US dollars in the past 15 years another 2.2 billion US dollars will flow into new hotel buildings alone in the next five years, this is what the renowned real estate consultancy Horwath HTL predicts. According to TOPHOTELPROJECTS, the worldwide leading provider for global b2b hotel data, currently 21 new top hotels and luxury resorts are in the pipeline in Croatia.\nThe tourist season is focused on the summer months: 60 percent of all hotel stays incurred in July and August. However, the number of overnight stays in private apartments and on campsites is much higher than the number of stays in hotels. Thanks to new, modern hotel facilities, the market share of the nights is to be increased.\nSituated on the beautiful Adriatic island of Brac several new properties, including a new cancer clinic for around 350 million euros will arise to promote the lucrative health tourism. In addition, new hotels will be built; the official tourism zone has now been extended.\nSelected hotel construction projects in Croatia:\nRomana Hotel Makarska – 310 rooms – opening: spring 2016 Thalasso Hotel Helios – 130 rooms – opening: autumn 2018 Nikki Beach Resort & Spa Hvar – 150 rooms – opening: autumn 2017 Dubrovnik Pearl Hotels – 5,000 rooms – expected opening: 2020 Biska Golf Resort Brtonigla – 270 rooms – opening: late-2016\nTOPHOTELPROJEFCTS collects and evaluates data about all hotel construction projects and hotel chains worldwide in an online database and provides its subscribers with a comprehensive overview of all major hotel projects, refurbishments and extensions worldwide.
