RevPar grew by 3.9 per cent compared to the same period last year with occupancy remaining high at 87 per cent.\nPremier Inn said the results were helped by a strong performance in London, where sales grew 21.1 per cent over the past three months.\nHarrison said: “Our first half performance keeps us on track to deliver full year expectations, as well as our ambitious growth milestones.”\nIn February, Premier Inn announced it was rolling out free wifi to every guest in all of its UK properties.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-09-08T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T22:05:17.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
