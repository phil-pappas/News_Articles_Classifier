Taking advantage of the countless theming opportunities available, Orla Kiely transformed RIBA’s Florence Hall with a miniature golf themed catwalk in a pastel motif, whilst Anya Hindmarch installed a striking 360° mirrored structure to showcase their new collection at the Royal Horticultural Halls’ Lindley Hall. \nDAKS also descended on the Lindley Hall for an elegant show full of business chic and savoir faire. Inspired by the history of Banqueting House, Giles Deacon introduced an alternative element to the structure of his show, with the stage set up in a circular layout. This allowed the models, including Poppy Delevigne, Georgia May Jagger, Irina Shayk and Eva Herzigova, to weave in and out of the audience for the ultimate visual experience. Giles Deacon commented: “I was thrilled this year to showcase my SS16 collection in the historical setting of Banqueting House. The fabulous architecture of the venue was a key inspiration for me in designing the collection.” The Saatchi Gallery was also at the heart of the action, hosting the cutting-edge fashion trade show SCOOP London on 20 – 22 September, where a significant collaboration was announced with the British Fashion Council, which will be key to SCOOP’s 2016 spring show.
