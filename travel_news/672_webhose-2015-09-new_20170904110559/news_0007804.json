They include sites of cultural or historic importance.\nGillibrand says she and Nadler are first asking President Barack Obama to declare Stonewall a monument. A congressional vote on park status would come later.\nGillibrand credited gay-rights activists for spurring action on giving greater recognition to the historic tavern raided by police more than four decades ago, triggering violent protests.\nDuring his second inauguration in 2013, Obama mentioned Stonewall and the struggle for LGBT equality as being on a par with women's and civil rights.\nStonewall would be the first park representing the gay community, but the fight isn't over, Gillibrand said.\n\"Same-sex couples don't have the same adoption rights, or the same federal benefits,\" she said. \"There's more work to do.\"\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T11:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T00:43:50.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
