It struggles to recruit clergy in a country where only 10 percent of the population describes itself as Catholic. Half the island’s priests are foreigners. It also relies heavily on donations from abroad to do its work in the deeply impoverished country, and is still banned from operating Catholic schools.\nPeople cheer as Pope Francis arrives to give a morning mass at the Calixto García square in Holguín, in eastern Cuba, on Sept. 21, 2015.\nRodrigo Arangua/AFP\nPope Francis and Guantanamo Among the faithful gathered in Holguín, hundreds had made a seven-hour trek by bus from the eastern province of Guantanamo , the site of the U.S. Naval base and detention center that is one of the most delicate issues in ongoing negotiations between Havana and Washington. Cuba has long called for the return of the base, which the United States rents for $4,085 a month under a permanent lease granted in a 1903 treaty.\n“We want to ask the pope for peace, tranquility, unity around the world and to help us get back the base,” said 54-year-old builder Noel Pérez from the town of Caimanera, near the base.\n“Francis is the third pope to visit us in Cuba, but the first Latin American, and he can help us get back the base,” said Norales Mendoza, 45, from Arroyo Hondo de Paraguay in Guantanamo province.\nHolguín is the only stop on Pope Francis’ trip that has never received a papal visit. It is known for a cross that has overlooked the city from a hilltop since a Franciscan monk hauled it up there in 1790 — though the original wooden version succumbed to old age and the 1950 replacement was destroyed by lightning.\nPope Francis was later due to visit the five-meter (16-foot) cross, now made of concrete, to bless the city of 291,000 inhabitants, Cuba’s fourth-largest.\nAfter his seven-hour stop in Holguín, the pope takes off for Santiago, the country’s second city — dubbed “the heroic city” by the communist regime because Fidel Castro declared there on Jan. 1, 1959 that his revolution had toppled dictator Fulgencio Batista.\nA woman waits for the start of Pope Francis’ morning mass at the Calixto García square in Holguín, in eastern Cuba, on Sept. 21, 2015.\nRodrigo Arangua/AFP\nVatican and dissidents Francis arrived Saturday afternoon and headed into a packed itinerary Sunday. He delivered mass to hundreds of thousands of people on Havana’s Revolution Square, met both Castro brothers, gave an off-the-script speech to local clergy and then addressed a crowd of young Cubans — all in the tropical heat.\nAt his morning mass in Havana, three Cuban dissidents were arrested as they approached Francis shouting “Freedom!” when he arrived in his “Popemobile.” Cuba bans opposition groups and routinely arrests dissidents who try to protest. Several leading dissidents have criticized the pope for not accepting their requests to meet him during his visit.\nVatican spokesman Federico Lombardi told journalists that Vatican officials had in fact been in contact with some dissidents, but that they had not managed to arrange a meeting.\nThe pope will leave from Santiago Tuesday for the United States, where his itinerary includes stops at the White House, the U.S. Congress and the United Nations General Assembly.\nRead more about Everyone’s Favorite Pope here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T10:10:19.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
