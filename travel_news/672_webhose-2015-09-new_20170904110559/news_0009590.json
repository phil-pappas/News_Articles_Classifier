I love London’s West End. I also love Indianapolis’ Beef and Boards Dinner Theatre. It’s the place where I saw my first live play; it was 32 years ago, and I became hooked on show tunes immediately. That show, in February 1983 was the musical, “South Pacific.” I kept the playbill from the evening, as well as the plastic lei they gave to the guests. It began my love affair with the islands; and now, after 37 trips to Polynesia, I’m actually packing my bags for our upcoming 82-day cruise tour to the South Pacific. When I learned that Beef and Boards was performing “South Pacific” once again, I had to go! It was like a homecoming. \nAfter seeing a myriad of plays, I believe “South Pacific” is one of the best musicals ever created. The music is infectious, the costumes are bold, the sets are dreamy and exotic, and the storyline is a romantic fantasy. \nDeb Wims stars as the cockeyed optimist Nellie Forbush. She is a little different from most actresses who play the part. Most Nellies have some baby fat, are a little clumsy, a little awkward. Wims plays Nellie with the grown up wiles of Reno Sweeney and comes off as a bit flirty when she’s around Emile de Becque, played by Robert Wilde. Wilde has a powerful presence on stage, with a strong and bold voice that demands a great deal of respect. \nCynthia Thomas plays one of the best Bloody Marys to ever set foot on stage. She has a resume to die for, including a stint with The Pointer Sisters. I could tell from her first cackle she was a magnificent performer. She glides gracefully across the stage with the ease of a ballerina and can also stomp down the beach like a scorned woman. A few times she crossed over into a classical voice, revealing her astonishing talent and versatility. \nAs soon as Mickey Rafalski sang his first few notes, I thought, “This is a Josh Groban or Michael Buble ready to cut a Christmas album.” He wowed the audience as Joseph Cable; his voice is unequivocally rich and smooth. \nJeff Stockberger, as Luther Billis, often upstaged the entire cast with his wacky physical comedy. I have never seen a Billis bounce around a desk, behind it, under it, and about it in such a hysterical manner. He reminds me of Rodney Dangerfield and could easily be the star of a one-man show. \nBeef and Boards is a popular destination for social groups; the theatre holds about 500 people and since it is in the half-round, there is never a bad seat. Seats are arranged in terraces, so you never have someone’s head blocking your view. Prior to curtain, the company rolls out giant buffet carts filled with gorgeously presented meats, vegetables and salads. Lemonade, tea or coffee is included in the ticket. \nIf your vacation plans take you to or through Indianapolis, I highly recommend making a reservation to enjoy one of the spectacularly produced shows at Beef and Boards. \nFollow the author, Anton Anderssen on Twitter @Hartforth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T05:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T10:45:16.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
