The bad news is you have run out of space so you have to move offices. While it may be tempting to stay put and try to squeeze everyone in, in the long run that will not do the business any good, and will send out the wrong message to customers and employees. Fortunately there are several things you can do to mitigate the pain. Your first step should be to appoint a project manager to oversee every aspect of the move, from redirecting the post to knowing where the keys are. If possible, move somewhere close by to minimise the loss of staff and customers. Choose somewhere with good transport links and local services so employees can still pop out and get a sandwich at lunch time. Ideally, ensure too that you have like-minded neighbours who are in the same sort of business. If you are the only creative industry in a block of accountants you may feel rather isolated. Order phone lines and broadband in advance as they take longer than expected to sort out Think hard about how much space you are going to need. Too little, and you may have to move again soon. Too much, and the business may struggle with the additional cost. Only move somewhere you can afford to pay for with work you already have, not hope to get. Where possible, allow employees to choose where they want to sit. Don't underestimate the importance of getting this right; if people feel that someone else has been given preferential treatment or that their wishes have been ignored then resentments will simmer. Arrange the move over a weekend to minimise disruption. Let customers know what you are doing and if there will be any downtime in the service they receive from you. Don’t forget, order phone lines and high-speed broadband far in advance as they will always take longer than they think to be connected. Make sure you have dealt with all paperwork properly. In particular, when terminating a lease be sure to follow the contractual obligations precisely and make sure that you give enough notice so that the lease does not roll on for another period. Finally, ensure you have a contingency plan for everything; be ready to switch to mobile phones and laptops if need be, or for employees to work from home, and know the number of a local hire firm which can provide portable heaters, fans and lighting at short notice, in case absolutely nothing works. Jason Downes is the managing director of conference call service providers Powwownow. He says it is important to plan ahead to minimise disruption: “Moving office should be an exciting time for any company as it normally means that sufficient growth has been made, yet it can cause considerable stress.\" \"It’s vital that all data and work is saved in a remote location, ideally in a private cloud, to enhance security and allow employees access to it throughout the in-between process.” Downes adds: “Ensure your new location has working internet connection before you move in; this should be the absolute priority instead of an afterthought.\" \"The internet is relied upon so heavily in businesses that being without it can cause the company huge disruption and significant financial loss.\" \"It is also paramount there is a contingency plan in place should there be IT system failings; this may be allowing staff to work from home or establishing a relationship with a temporary office space.\" \"It is crucial too that communication with your workforce and clients throughout the process is maintained.” • Wherever you’re based, the right company car, financed in the best way makes good business sense.
