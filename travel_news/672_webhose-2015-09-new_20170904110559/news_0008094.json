The plane reportedly experienced other issues with the landing gear door and flaps as well as per the statements from the Port Authority.\nWhile the plane returned to Kennedy Airport to make an emergency landing, it approached the runway faster than normal and due to the overheating of brakes few sparks of fire were spotted in the landing gear compartment.\nThe emergency responders were on spot and actively extinguished the fire before it could cause further damage. All the 110 passengers were safe disembarked from the aircraft. According to reports, they were put on next flights.\nThe plane was being connected to a tug to be removed, Port Authority said. Itâ€™s not clear how many passengers were on board; no injuries have been reported.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T12:31:08.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
