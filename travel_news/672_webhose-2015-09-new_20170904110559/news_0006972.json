There’s no easy way to scale the flanks of this brooding hump, and when you finally, painstakingly reach the plateau, the moorland that greets you appears bleak and unrelenting. For many of us, that’s the charm of moorland. The ascent of Kinder is the first stage of the Pennine Way, one of Britain’s most popular long-distance paths. And there is a good case for arguing that Grindsbrook Clough, the original route of the Pennine Way, which inched its way up Kinder, is as tough an ascent as anything between Derbyshire and Kirk Yetholm in the Scottish Borders. • An in-depth look at the Peak District Within three hours of leaving the cosy dales below, most walkers are left exhausted, blistered and frequently disorientated in the lightestmists. Despite so often laying down a demanding physical challenge, Kinder holds a special pace in the hearts of all walkers. Eighty years ago this stretch of land, then out of bounds to the masses, became the focus for the campaign for access to the countryside. Ravens, red grouse, peregrine falcons and curlews are among the birds you may see here, perhaps with a ring ouzel, whose ring of white feathers resembles a vicar’s collar, hopping and scuttling ahead. Ravens, red grouse, peregrine falcons and curlews are among the birds you may see here, perhaps with a ring ouzel, whose ring of white feathers resembles a vicar’s collar. Meanwhile, the ground is dotted with wavy cotton-grass, a native species, named for its fluffy seed heads and patches of multi-coloured sphagnum moss. “This is known as the dark peak for a reason,” says Philip Weiss, the National Trust’s project officer for Kinder Scout. “You have that dark peat, aesthetically it’s a big feature – you can see it as you drive between Sheffield and Manchester.” The walk starts out from Edale, and passes the Nag's Head pub (Alamy) Kinder’s moorland evolved from prehistoric river deltas that deposited mud which in turn hardened into shale. Over time, more sand and mud was deposited, forming alternate layers of sandstone and shale, eventually becoming millstone grit. Yet it is surprisingly vulnerable. Overgrazing by sheep, industrial pollution, wildfires, even walkers, have taken their toll and increasingly led to the peat drying out, in turn threatening species such as golden plover, mountain hare and curlew. The Trust’s response has been to fence much of the moorland off – not to walkers – who can still access the moor through stiles every 50-100m, but to sheep. Gullies are being blocked, too, to prevent water from draining off and cotton-grass is being replenished by dropping hundreds of thousands of seed pods on the moors. They’re delivered by helicopter but must be planted by hand, while heather seed and beads of sphagnum – which look like cranberries – are being dispersed too. At the top, moorlands fill the horizon to the north and can exert a Siren-like pull, enticing you to follow the Pennine Way rather than this route, which contours around the lip of Kinder. To the west is Manchester, and in good light you’ll be able to pick out Jodrell Bank. Head east, though, and you’re likely to be left breathless by the spectacle of The Woolpacks, Crowden Tower and other improbable stone features. This is a moonscape of isolated, freakishly curved stones, fashioned and polished by the weather. Huge weathered stone columns, boulders and pillars appear to have fallen from the sky. Their shapes are like props from sci-fi movies: resembling fossilised giant snails, oversized upturned teeth, roots pointing skywards, and mini asteroids. And the good news is that this route takes you down Grindsbrook Clough, rather than up it, though it is still a steep decent requiring patience and a watchful eye. Grade: Hard Distance : 7.5 miles (12km) Time : 3 hours OS Map: Explorer OL1 Terrain: Paths are generally good but rugged on this circular route. Some moderately challenging ascents and descents. Good fitness level and hill-walking clothing are essential. Getting there By train: Edale station is 330yd (300m) from start of walk By car: Edale village is off A6187 from Hathersage in the Hope Valley Route Start: Edale, grid ref: SK124856 1. Set foot from Edale station and head up through the village, passing the Moorland Centre on your right. 2. Turn left on to the Pennine Way opposite the Nag’s Head pub. 3. Follow the Pennine Way to Upper Booth Farm, which has won awards for its habitat restoration work. 4. As you walk alongside the River Noe, you pass some ancient clough woodland on your left. It's a remnant of far larger woods which used to cover these steep hillsides. 5. Climb Jacob’s Ladder footpath. It was recently rebuilt by the National Trust using gritstone boulders which were airlifted in by helicopter. This section of the Pennine Way was once a packhorse route crossing the moors. Lead, coal, salt and wool were transported in this way from medieval times until the railways arrived. Turn right onto Kinder Plateau when you reach the top. 6. Come off the Pennine Way, taking a path to your right and skirt eastwards around Kinder Plateau. On the left, around the giant anvil-shaped rock known as Noe Stool, you'll see heavily-degraded areas of exposed peat. The ?tors? along the Kinder Edges are some of the most spectacular sights in the Peak District (Alamy) 7. The weathered gritstone rocks or ‘tors’ along the Kinder Edges are some of the most spectacular sights in the Peak District. Continue past Crowden Tower then follow the footpath as it drops down into Grindsbrook. 8. You will be treated to sweeping views of the Vale of Edale as you descend from the plateau. Notice the patterns of historic dry-stone walls and field boundaries. Follow the Grindsbrook footpath back to Edale village.
