More than 200 golfers will be taking part, from all walks of life, and each will be hoping to grab the opportunity for a golfing trip of a lifetime.\nNext February, 32 successful golfers will enjoy complimentary return flights to Morocco, five nights’ accommodation at the five-star Sofitel Essaouira Mogador Golf & Spa hotel – nestled in the lush surroundings of a wild beach lined with eucalyptus and mimosa, overlooking the Atlantic – and four rounds of golf at nearby Golf de Mogador, in Essaouira, a beautiful 16th-century, fortified harbour town on Morocco’s Atlantic coast. Participants will also receive a welcome reception and cocktail evening, and a final night presentation gala dinner.\n \n \nThe highly rated Gary Player-designed links-style course at Golf de Mogador, which dates from 2009, demands long carries between tees and fairways, as the vegetation and sand shape the layout.\n \n \nFour competitions culminate at the grand final, sponsored for a second year by the Moroccan National Tourist Office: singles, pairs, mixed pairs and senior pairs, with 32 golfers, from across the UK, ultimately fighting it out for the titles. Each finalist will have played up to four qualifying rounds merely to reach the regional final, with the knockout rounds taking place between June and September, and the regional finals in October.\n \n \nThe Moroccan National Tourist Office’s director for UK and Ireland, Amine Boughaleb, said: “Last year was the centenary of golf in Morocco and, fittingly, the first year our country was the title sponsor of the HowDidiDo Matchplay. The event was such a huge success, however, for both the participants and Morocco, that we were only too happy to renew our association with the competition.\n \n \n“We are confident that the excellent facilities on offer at both the hotel and golf course will leave the lucky 32 golfers keen to return to see more of our beautiful country.”\n \n \nThe burgeoning Kingdom of Morocco has 29 golf courses to be enjoyed in year-round sunshine – plus 11 more under construction – and, with flight times of less than three-and-a-half hours from the UK and Ireland, it is a hugely attractive alternative to the more traditional golf destinations of Europe.\n \n \nHowDidiDo is Europe’s largest golfing community, holding in excess of 21 million rounds of golf along with the handicaps, results and scores of more than 1,300,000 UK golf club members. Around 2,000 golf clubs and more than 460,000 golfers currently use the HowDidiDo system.\n \n \nDistributed by the Azalea Group \nInformation for journalists \nHOWDIDIDO MEDIA\nHowDidiDo is Europe’s largest golfing community, holding in excess of 21 million rounds of golf along with the handicaps, results and scores of more than 1,300,000 UK golf club members.
