Kuala Lumpur (S$118) came in second with a 14 per cent decrease. \n\nHotels in Singapore also experienced a nine per cent fall in average hotel prices paid by domestic travellers, making staycations now more affordable for locals. \n\n“Asia has consistently proven to be the region where travellers can enjoy luxury-for-less travel options. Malaysia’s proximity to Singapore and the recent depreciation of the Malaysian ringgit has positioned the country as an attractive and convenient travel destination for both shorthaul and longhaul trips,” said Katherine Cole, regional director, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore at Hotels.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T11:17:05.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
