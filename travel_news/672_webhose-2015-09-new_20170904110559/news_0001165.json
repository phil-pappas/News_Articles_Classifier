After a 1-0 Real Madrid win over Spanish La Liga rival Granada on Saturday, the unflappable Real Madrid goalie has extended his record-setting string of shutouts to five games. \nAnd as was the case in the past four matches , the opposition had its fair share of chances on goal after breaking down Madrid’s backline. But against Granada, the gutsy Costa Rican goalie ran out of the box on two different occasions to deny what looked like sure goals. \nFirst, in the 15th minute, Navas stole away a golden scoring opportunity that would have seen Granada tie the game up. \nThen again in the 38th minute, Keylor Navas ran out of the net to save Los Merengues when Granada’s Isaac Success was threatening. The Costa Rican keeper played it beautifully by being the aggressor and blocking the ball just as Success kicked at it. Por estas paradas \"imposibles\" se quedó Keylor Navas en el Real Madrid.

Navas’ five straight games without conceding a goal extends his club record for the best start ever by a Real Madrid goalkeeper. The fifth game without a score also ties the record of legendary Madrid goalie Iker Casillas for most consecutive shutouts in club history.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T22:34:47.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
