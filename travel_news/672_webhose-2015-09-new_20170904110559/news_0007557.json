I’m not drinking very fast because I can’t stop smelling it. \nI am reminded of the previous day, when Salengo and I were walking though the 45-acre vineyard in Winters, where they focus on Spanish varietals and, according to Salengo “whatever grows best here.” Between checking the brix on her refractometer, Salengo tells me that an X-ray technician once told her she had the largest nasal cavities she’d ever seen. “Who knows if that means anything?” Salengo says. “People are always telling me I have this weirdly amazing sense of smell, but maybe that’s just something people say to someone who makes wine.” Related Stories How they roll in bike-friendly Davis \nI smell the Petite Sirah again. It is swoon-worthy, with a perfumed strawberry essence on top of a rich darkness. All of her wines — her creamy Malbec, her racy Sauvignon Blanc , her polished Durif — smell amazing, and support a theory that they were crafted by someone with a mastery of this particular sense. That said, since her success seems rooted in her sense of herself as a very regular, hardworking person, perhaps it’s better she remain skeptical about the possibility of being exceptional. \nA week later at 1 o’clock on a Wednesday afternoon the Fitbit Salengo received for her 35th birthday is already at 11,000 steps. She has already done fermentation checks on 30 bins, set up work orders for her three-person harvest crew, and taken her daily hour or so walk through the vineyard to determine picking times. Before she drives her first-generation Prius back to her little house and dogs and her HBO Go account at around 9:30 p.m., she will have made that walk again, checked on the picking crew, and, likely, a few male egos. \n“I try not to let that stuff get me down. I have other things to focus on. Like my experiments. For example, I have four different Tempranillo lots going right now, because I want to figure out what works best.” \nA former colleague once asked her why she made things so hard on herself. “So I asked him why he was so lazy,” Salengo says. \nYou’re aware of the latest success buzzword, grit? Salengo is grit’s poster child. “Some people were born and bred for the wine business,” she says. “I grew up drinking Kool-Aid and eating Hamburger Helper.” \nThough she looks like a California girl, long-legged, blonde, with an exuberant smile, she is a purebred Yankee from upstate New York via Vermont. Her Ivy League dreams were thwarted by economic realities, and at SUNY Oneonta she majored in political science. \nAfter running though a series of loathed jobs, she remembers thinking how great it would be to have parents who could float her for she figured it all out. \nFortunately that was not in the cards, because Salengo got a waitressing job at Tucos, a now-closed restaurant/vintage and boutique wine store in Davis. On her first day she had Inniskillin — a rare, expensive ice wine from Ontario — and she was hooked. “I had never tasted anything that delicious.” She displayed an instant knack for wine and food pairings. \n“My boss would quiz me all the time, ‘Nicole, what goes with this? What goes with that?’ and I’d be like, “Uh, the Vaqueyras? The Rioja?” \nShe was promoted to wine buyer, and she started hanging out with the viticulture and enology students from UC Davis. She also enrolled in Davis’ winemaking certificate program. “I went from never having tried wine to being totally obsessed with it within a span of six weeks, and ever since then, it’s been everything to me,” Salengo says. \nIt is not an unblemished fairy tale. She had disappointing turns as a winemaker for two small, now defunct Yolo County wineries. A harvest job at Kenzo in Napa led Salengo to an ongoing obsession with their Sauvignon Blanc (“I love how it’s so clean and so complex at the same time”) and she was dead set on getting a permanent position there. After being laid off she drove to the top of a mountain in Napa and screamed for an entire hour. “Then, I resolved that one day, I would make a Sauvignon Blanc even better than theirs!” \nShe rather rashly went off to New Zealand to work the Sauvignon Blanc harvest. “Even though I was more in love with wine than ever, I flew back prepared to give it up if I couldn’t make it work,” she says. \nHours after landing, she got an e-mail from Berryessa Gap, offering her the current position. \nSalengo is now very glad not to be in Napa — 30 miles to the west but a world away in prestige and name recognition. “I know now I would feel very boxed in there. I love the challenge of making wine in Yolo County,” she says. “I love it whenever someone says, ‘Oh you can’t do that,’ because then I have an opportunity to prove them wrong.” Granted, no one’s told Salengo making wine in Yolo County is impossible, but they’ve certainly suggested making great wine is. \nWhile it is probably a little early to call her wines great, they are without question impressive. Her Sauvignon Blanc might not yet be the equal of Kenzo, but it is clean and complex, with bright aromatics and strong fruit, and, given the New Zealand influence, more bracing than a lot of signature California Sauvignon Blancs. Her Petite Sirah is varietally correct, but has a feminine quality, it’s classic with a lacy edge. Her Durif (very close to Petite Sirah) is my favorite, and hers too. “It’s just a really romantic, full, deep brooding wine,” she says. \nIt is easy to overstate Salengo’s modesty. She does know she’s good at her job. “I’m extremely particular about how I want things done, and I believe in my instincts.” And though she sees the mystery in winemaking, she thinks that the secret to making better and better wines lies in looking at it as a job. \n“You get to think, you get to physically push yourself, you use chemistry, and you also get to make crazy, risky decisions.” \nThat said, she can’t help but reflect sometimes on the strange serendipity that got her here. \n“It’s not exactly a rags-to-riches story, because I’m not rich, but I love my job so much that sometimes I feel like I am.” \nSarah Miller is a freelance writer.
