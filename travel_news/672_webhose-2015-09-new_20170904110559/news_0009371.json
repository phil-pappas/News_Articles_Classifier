The city is bringing together international galleries, artists from all over the world, collectors, art critics and art lovers through events such as Biennial Istanbul, Art International and Contemporary Istanbul. Set on the shores of Bosphorus, Four Seasons Hotel Istanbul at the Bosphorus has a convenient location due to its proximity to many of the event venues. An artsy visit can be turned into a great excuse to enjoy a drink with breathtaking views of the Bosphorus. Guests can indulge in savoury snacks at Yalı, a charming lounge on the Bosphorus. Having its own piers, the Hotel is at a perfect spot for private boat or water taxi arrangements for exhibitions in Prince Islands as well.\nIstanbul has an exciting art agenda for the rest of the year. Art International will bring together leading international and local galleries on September 5 and 6, 2015.\nOrganised by the Istanbul Foundation for Culture and Arts (İKSV), the 14th Istanbul Biennial takes place between September 5 and November 1, 2015, drafted by Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev – author, organiser of events and exhibitions, and researcher of artistic practices, the histories of art and the politics of aesthetics – with a number of others. Saltwater: a Theory of Thought Forms, with salt water being seen both as a dividing and uniting element for the city of İstanbul with a simple allusion to its Bosporus Strait and the seas that surround the city, makes up the conceptual framework of the contemporary art show, which will bring together a selection of new work by more than 50 artists from Turkey and abroad. The exhibition spreads to several different venues around the city, including Prince Islands.\nSource:-Four Seasons Hotel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T15:00:01.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
