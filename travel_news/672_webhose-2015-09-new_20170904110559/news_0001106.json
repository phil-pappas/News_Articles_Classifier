But collectively, our partnership serves 330 destinations, flies almost 700 aircraft and carries over 100 million passengers each year, making us the world’s seventh largest grouping of airlines. We leverage the buying power, resources, relationships and influence of our participating airlines to achieve the most cost-effective and customer-friendly outcomes.” \nMembers of Etihad Airways Partners also work together to reduce costs and improve efficiency and customer choice through measures which otherwise would only be available through mergers or takeovers. \nIn addition to codesharing and joint commercial activities, the members of Etihad Airways Partners collaborate through resource sharing, adoption of best practice, and joint procurement of assets, services and supplies. \nThey also develop relationships between each other, or facilitate deals with external airline partners or suppliers. \nBeyond last week’s joint financing agreement, the airlines also collaborate on the sourcing of IT platforms, aircraft and insurance, and share resources including pilot and cabin crew training. \nA number of airlines in the group have sourced additional aircraft from each other or redeployed excess fleet to each other. \nEmployees have been transferred between airlines, enabling members of Etihad Airways Partners to recruit skills or provide fresh employment opportunities within the group. \nService and product of the partner airlines, in the air and on the ground, is increasingly being aligned as part of a strategy to offer customers a seamless, high quality product across Etihad Airways Partners. \nLoyalty programs are also interconnected between the airlines of Etihad Airways Partners. Etihad Airways Group has established the Global Loyalty Company, which owns the Etihad Guest program and majority stakes in airberlin’s topbonus, Alitalia’s MilleMiglia and the Jet Privilege program of Jet Airways. \nAir Serbia, Air Seychelles and Etihad Regional have all adopted the Etihad Guest program, while NIKI uses topbonus. \nAlitalia and airberlin are also introducing the same Business Class service and product as Etihad Airways, initially on long haul aircraft, and many more opportunities for collaboration are being explored by all of the Etihad Airways Partners airlines for both passenger and air cargo services. \nPHOTO (L-R): Bruno Matheu, Chief Operating Officer Equity Partners, Etihad Airways; Roy Kinnear, CEO, Air Seychelles; Stefan Pichler, CEO, airberlin; James Hogan, President and CEO, Etihad Airways; Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, Chairman, Alitalia; Maurizio Merlo, CEO, Etihad Regional; Cramer Ball, CEO, Jet Airways; Dane Kondic, CEO Air Serbia", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T21:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T00:25:46.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
