The Silicon Valley tech firm, which broke Kickstarter records in 2012 when it launched its first smartwatch, has added a countdown timer to the homepage of its website, which will run out at 18.00 BST on 23 September 2015. Pebble isn't giving any hints as to what the announcement could be. However, it has long been rumoured to be developing a round smartwatch, in response to the growing trend for wrist-worn devices with circular displays. Although Pebble's chief executive Eric Migicovsky has previously insisted that the success of smartwatches hinges on functionality rather than design , he has made concessions to style – for example, with the Pebble Time Steel , which is made from stainless steel and features a colour e-paper display. Pebble Time Steel Although it has been suggested that the timer could be counting down to the release of the Pebble 3.0, the next major software update for Pebble watches, an anonymous source has told Ubergizmo that the countdown is to the unveiling of a new watch. The source reportedly said that the new Pebble watch will have a round face with a 0.9-inch screen and a metal finish. It will also come in two sizes, presumably designed for men and women – like the Apple Watch. The timer will run out just as Mr Migicovsky’s begins his keynote at TechCrunch Disrupt , the annual conference hosted by TechCrunch in San Francisco that aims to showcase the best startups and game-changing technologies of the moment. There are doubts that the Pebble chief executive would actually unveil the next Pebble smartwatch while on stage, but he might announce a Kickstarter campaign for it, as this has been the route to market for all previous devices. Samsung Gear S2 (L) and Gear S2 Classic (R) Last month, Samsung became the latest smartwatch maker to jump on the round-face bandwagon , with the launch of the Gear S2, featuring a 1.2-inch 360x360 circular screen and a rotating bezel to help with navigation. Despite the popularity of the Apple Watch , which has a square face, most other consumer electronics manufacturers have gravitated towards circular smartwatches, with devices like the LG Watch Urbane and Moto 360 attracting praise for their fashion-conscious design. telegraphsciencetech Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T06:46:09.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
