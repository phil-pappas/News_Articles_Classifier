Head Chef Jared Reeves draws on his Kansas City heritage and experience in some of Sydney’s top restaurants to deliver a gourmet twist on traditional favourites from sharing plates to hearty meals and sweet treats. Expect dishes that match the artisan philosophy of GRAIN Bar, which is dedicated to the “fine craft of drinking,” serving up craft beers on tap, an enviable selection of whiskys and bourbons, a largely organic wine list and fashionable cocktails.\nThe whisky influence of GRAIN Bar permeates the new menu with Reeves’ Rangers Valley minute steak, topped with onion rings and a dollop of bourbon butter. The butter is infused with roasted garlic and the bourbon adds a deliciously earthy note. Equally enticing and every man’s dream is a BBQ brisket sandwich with cheddar cheese, horseradish and gravy for dipping. A smokey meats platter consisting of lamb ribs, slow roasted pork belly, wagyu brisket, cucumber kimchi and sweet buns will satisfy any inner carnivore, while a GRAIN burger filled with maple glazed bacon and whisky onion jam is sure to please every Aussie American heart.\nTimeless finishes and a stylish setting makes GRAIN Bar a playground for Sydney’s sophisticated. Settle in for a memorable afternoon or evening with friends over some tasty share plates. Communal offerings include burnt bleu cheese dip, a portobello mushroom pizzetta featuring the ever-trendy kale and a charcuterie plate with the under-celebrated sobrasada (raw cured sausage). Reeves has recreated his childhood favourite dishes with the classic doughnut, matured into a cronut (cross between croissant and donut), filled with maple bourbon custard. For the sweet tooth, be sure to try the espresso ice cream sandwiched between peanut butter cookies.\nThe talented GRAIN Bar team, passionate for scotch, have also paired a selection of cheeses from Simon Johnson with some of their favourite drams. Nightly specials include Whisky Monday with 20 percent savings on all whisky and flights for AUD 30, Wine and Cheese Wednesdays, and Oyster and Champagne Fridays from 5:00 to 9:00 pm featuring AUD 1.50 freshly shucked Oysters and a AUD 15 glass of Louis Roederer Champagne. GRAIN Bar is open every day from 12:00 noon until late and is available for private hire and functions. For bookings call 02 9250 3118.\nSource:- Four Seasons Hotels & Resort", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:07:42.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
