Visitors are relentlessly targeted, hassled and asked for money. They are invariably lost, duped, welcomed and invited into every shop on every corner of every street.\nBy late afternoon, the main square Djemaa el-Fna morphs into a cacophonous mess of smoke, drums, donkeys, monkeys, snake charmers, belly dancers, henna artists and orange juice sellers. It’s mesmerising, confusing and exciting; but also somewhat draining.\nSo it’s important to choose a comfortable corner of the medina (old town) to retreat to.\nFor those seeking total privacy there is the exclusive 1,800 square metre Riad d’Honneur with its own set of staff and underground cinema\nIt took more than 1,000 craftsmen three and a half years to piece, carve and weld together. Nothing was deemed too extravagant\nFor two nights, either side of hauling our perspiring bodies through the medina, my boyfriend and I booked into the Royal Mansour, a jewel of a hotel commissioned by King Mohammed VI for an undisclosed (but undoubtedly devastating) amount.\nSince it opened five years ago it has served as an overspill for his royal and diplomatic guests, as well as those who can afford it. Hilary Clinton, John Legend and Sam Smith all recently stayed and holidaymakers will share breathing space with Russian billionaires, glittery supermodels, statesmen and presidents.\nRELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Fantasy island!

The hotel is built into the city’s ancient 12th century walls and is a fragrant utopia with rich men in expensive jackets passing through like exotic birds.\nUnsurprisingly, the rates are not cheap. The cheapest riad here is £730 per night during low season and can rise to £6,640 per night at other times. Each comes with a roof top sun deck and plunge pool where you can have breakfast laid and your home paper printed off on A3 sheets and bound together in gold ribbon. Living quarters are fabulously ornate and the larger riads have galleries and dinning rooms.\nFor those seeking total privacy there is the exclusive 1,800 square metre Riad d’Honneur with its own set of staff, two pools, a private spa, gym and underground cinema.\nThe main square Djemaa el-Fna morphs into a cacophonous mess of smoke, drums, donkeys, monkeys, snake charmers and belly dancers\nAll menus in each of the hotel's three restaurants (Moroccan, French and one designed for all day alfresco eating) are devised by Parisian three Michelin star chef Yannick Alléno and, according a hotel spokesperson, ‘He oversees each and every dish and drink’.\nHis most gorging menu is a black truffle four-course extravaganza that includes purple artichoke tagine with duck’s meat and truffle ice cream for £200 per person.\nWe tried fabulous plates of 36-hour cooked lamb shoulder and apple cinnamon cake with jasmine élexir .\nThe most gorging menu is a black truffle four-course extravaganza that includes truffle ice cream and costs £200 per person\nBeneath the hotel is a network of underground tunnels, purpose built for staff to ride around on golf buggies, ferreting things to and fro\nDuring our stay I was shown around a large outdoor and indoor pool and an even larger spa, open for traditional hammams, hair cutting, coiffing, yoga and pilates.\nBeneath your feet is a network of underground tunnels, purpose built for staff to ride around on golf buggies, ferreting things to and fro without you seeing them.\nWe wrenched ourselves away from the surreal luxury to see some of Marrakech's less outlandish but equally impressive sites.\nTop of the list is Ben Youssef Medersa, a 14th century Islamic school that housed up to 900 students at one time.\nFor a small fee we explored it’s tiny rooms and courtyard decorated with beautiful stucco plasterwork, carved cedar and blue and green mosaics and climbed into the old student bedsits.\nLandscape painter Jacques Majorelle’s Jardin Majorelle is a marvel too but go early in the morning to beat the busloads of tourists.\nYves Saint Lauren and his partner Pierre Bergé bought the art deco garden in 1980 and poured great resources into preserving it. It's now a serene green sanctuary of palms, exotic plants, cacti and bird life.\nBen Youssef Medersa (left) is a 14th century Islamic school that housed 900 students at one time with beautiful stucco plasterwork (right)\nThere is a permanent Berber museum on site at the moment but there are plans are afoot to display some of YSL’s greatest pieces there from next year too.\nIt's impossible to visit Marrakech and not spend a day getting lost in the souks. Marrkechis will try to convince you of the merits of everything they have on offer but don’t be afraid to hunt out quality. Most leather bags and belts on the well-beaten tourist paths are untreated and will start to rot and smell within months of returning home.\nFor a really authentic experience, leave behind the tourists and dive into the flea market at Bab el Khmis which is where the locals shop\nIt's impossible to visit and not spend a day getting lost in the souks. Marrkechis will convince you of the merits of everything they sell\nWe stumbled upon Joāo, a talented Portuguese designer who owns the shop Joykech. Hunt him out for handmade kaftans, bags, shoes and beaded necklaces. I brought home a beautiful clutch sewn from an old Moroccan kaftan.\nFor a really authentic experience, leave behind the tourists and dive into the flea market at Bab el Khmis. Nothing will prepare you for the acres of old furniture, mountains of wing mirrors, mattresses, clothes, sunglasses and bits of tat.\nDon’t write anything off as there are some real treasures - paintings, antiques, vases and chairs - to be found.\nMorocco's tangle of narrow streets, dusty stalls and sulphurous tanneries are a wonderful assault on the senses\nLastly, as the sun sets, beat your way to El Fenn. The hotel is owned by Richard Branson’s sister Vanessa and is made up of a collection of seven neighbouring riads.\nThe walls are brightly coloured and original retro furniture sourced from local markets take up every corner. The roof top restaurant and bar gives unparalleled views of the ancient city as the last rays dip behind the Atlas Mountains and the call for prayer sounds out across the medina.\nTRAVEL FACTS A one-bedroom riad at Royal Mansour starts from £684 per night.\nFor bookings contact +212 52 98 08080 or royalmansour.com\nFlights start at £254 return.
