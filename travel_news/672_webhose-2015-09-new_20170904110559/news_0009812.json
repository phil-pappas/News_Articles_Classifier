Picture: REUTERS Related articles VW chief under fire as scandal grows Volkswagen emissions scandal needs EU inquiry, French minister says CAR makers woo customers with promises of speed, acceleration and braking distance. Less sexy is the increasingly critical element that helps them deliver that performance: software.\nIn the case of Volkswagen, it was software that the US Environmental Protection Agency says allowed about 500,000 US-sold Volkswagen-made cars to pass emissions tests. Volkswagen said on Tuesday as many as 11-million vehicles may have the same software, which US regulators called a \"defeat device.\" It also said it would set aside €6.5bn to cover legal and others costs to deal with the disclosure.\nNew cars can have as many as 20-million lines of software code, more than many aircraft, said Bodo Seifert, a US-based vehicle software expert.\nThe software controls everything from running the engine, gearbox and diagnostics to the radio and power windows. It can also help a car control the amount of pollutants it emits — by monitoring levels of things such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide — a byproduct of diesel-engine combustion. It can then figure out when to trap pollutants, or divert them through processes that can convert them into less-harmful substances to meet legal limits, according to Greg Schroeder, assistant director at the Ann Arbor, Michigan, Centre for Automotive Research.\nAt different stages of engine use — for instance, idling versus cruising on the highway — engine combustion can create widely different levels of pollutants. Diesel engines don’t emit much carbon monoxide, but they generally generate a greater amount of nitrogen oxide, or NOx — a component in acid rain and low-atmosphere ozone.\nIn the US, where diesel passenger car sales are still comparatively modest, regulators have set far tougher NOx standards than in Europe, where diesel engines have long been more popular.\nDiesel-powered cars use a complex mix of sensors and sophisticated engine-management software to keep track and limit emission levels. The software can influence how much NOx is produced during combustion by regulating the mix of diesel fuel and oxygen used in the process. Cars also rely on a mix of NOx traps, which capture the pollutant, and catalysts to clean emissions and meet standards. But the measures to reduce pollution come at a cost, vehicle engineers say, including reducing power that can hamper acceleration.\nLimiting the use of the devices used to curtail emissions could improve fuel economy and cut noise in the car, said a European car engineer. The engine software can control how much NOx is filtered from the exhaust. It is unclear what the VW software in question did specifically to reduce emissions during testing. But by collating such data as tyre rotation, steering, and use of the accelerator, a program could determine whether a car was being driven on the road or merely on a test bed at an emissions-testing station.\nIf such software sensed a lack of steering wheel inputs, for instance, it might have been able to predict it was being tested for emissions, and divert more pollutants to traps or treatment.\nVolkswagen hasn’t named the specific software or component on the engine affected. On Tuesday, it said its Type EA 189 engines — found in some diesel models such as the Jetta — displayed \"a noticeable deviation between bench test results and actual road use,\" adding it was \"working intensely to eliminate these deviations through technical measures.\"\nExperts aren’t even sure at this stage whether Volkswagen manufactured the software or components involved. Calibrating a third-party component or piece of software to respond in a certain way could be enough to make up for the discrepancy, experts say.\nGerman engineering company Robert Bosch GmbH said it made components for the Volkswagen cars now being probed. While the company said it \"develops injection and exhaust-gas treatment systems that can reduce emissions in every driving situation,\" the Stuttgart, Germany, company added that \"responsibility for calibrating and integrating the components supplied by Bosch into the system as a whole lies with VW.\"\nMore Africa news from The Wall Street Journal\nMore news from The Wall Street Journal\nPremium access to WSJ.com: $1 a week for 12 weeks", "external_links": ["http://online.wsj.com/public/page/news-africa.html?mod=TMGSAlink1", "https://join.wsjeuropesubs.com/tmg1", "http://online.wsj.com/europe?mod=TMGSAlink2", "https://www.wsjeuropesubs.com/wsj12offer/?tagsrc=/tmg1&rnd=54622c7ae7d81"], "published": "2015-09-23T19:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T18:17:02.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
