The hotel industry has been exempted from the smoking ban that has been in place since the state Clean Indoor Air Act was passed in 2003.\nZebrowski said the proposal— introduced late last month—was motivated by personal experience.\n“I’ll be honest, I spend a lot of time in hotel rooms,” he told the Democrat & Chronicle. “One of the things I’ve noticed is if you are above, below or next to a smoking room — even if you’re a non-smoker — it comes right through the vents.”\nTobacco companies are likely to oppose the bill. Altria, the parent company of Phillip Morris USA, contends it should be up to business owners to decide whether smoking is permitted inside their facilities.\nSimilar bans already exists in other states, including North Dakota, Vermont, Michigan and Indiana.", "external_links": ["http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/2015/09/02/bill-ban-smoking-ny-hotels/71620152/", "http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?default_fld=&bn=A08371&term=2015&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Votes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y"], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T17:21:21.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
