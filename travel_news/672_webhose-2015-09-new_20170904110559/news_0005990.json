No injuries were reported.\nA passenger on one of the planes posted a picture to Instagram showing the wing of one of the 737s that appeared to be damaged in the incident.\n\"My flight shouldn't look like that.. RIGHT???!,\" passenger Manas Gowd said via Instagram along with his photo .\nInstagram | @themanasutra\nMy flight shouldn't look like that.. RIGHT???! @southwestair\n\"I watched the clipping occur as I was looking out the window, and when our plane lurched back from the gate we felt a very unnatural thump,\" Gowd tells The Daily Mail of London. \"We quickly realized that a chunk of the plane wing had broken off and fallen to the tarmac.\"\nThe incident forced the airline to take both planes out of service for maintenance evaluations.\nSouthwest spokeswoman Alyssa Eliasen confirmed the incident to Today in the Sky, offering the following statement Monday morning:\n\"Last evening while pushing back from the gate at Oakland Airport, the wing on a Southwest Airlines aircraft operating flight number 2674 departing from Oakland to Orange County came into contact with the wing of another Southwest aircraft. No Customer or Employee injuries were reported on either aircraft. Both planes were taken out of service and will undergo a maintenance check. Safety is always our number one focus and we are conducting an internal review to identify details surrounding yesterday's event.\"\nThe airline said it was working to get fliers whose flights were canceled by the incident on to their final destinations.\nTWITTER : You can follow me at twitter.com/TodayInTheSky\n24 CONNECT 34 TWEET 4 LINKEDIN 3 //usat.ly/1Evw2LZ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TodayInTheSky%20", "http://usat.ly/1Evw2LZ", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/22fe6f3f97c48eb2889377e683aa4c513308aa22/c=0-69-596-517&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/08/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/635766180842747906-swa.jpg", "https://instagram.com/themanasutra", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/08/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/635766180842747906-swa.jpg", "https://igcdn-photos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/t51.2885-15/e35/11906263_735346263278395_842703278_n.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Evw2LZ&mini=true", "https://instagram.com/p/7CNATdKqLt/?taken-by=themanasutra", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-3216915/Southwest-Airlines-plane-chunk-wing-tip-torn-Boeing-737s-collide-taxiing-Oakland-airport.html", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Evw2LZ&text=Two%20Southwest%20Boeing%20737s%20clip%20wings%20at%20Oakland%20airport&via=usatoday"], "published": "2015-08-31T16:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T01:49:57.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
