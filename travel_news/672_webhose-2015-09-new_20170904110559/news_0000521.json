Cereal Killer, in Shoreditch, east London , was attacked by a group of around 200 hooded assailants who daubed ‘scum’ on the windows while terrified customers cowered inside. The \"Anti Gentrification\" protest in Shoreditch Photo: Pixel8000 Police were called to the scene on Brick Lane on Saturday night, which was advertised on social media. The event, billed as the third “Fuck Parade”, was apparently organised by the anarchist group Class War. A Facebook statement said: “Our communities are being ripped apart - by Russian oligarchs, Saudi Sheiks, Israeli scumbag property developers, Texan oil-money twats and our own home-grown Eton toffs. Cereal Killer daubed in paint and graffiti Photo: Gavin Rodgers/ Pixel “Soon this City will be an unrecognisable, bland, yuppie infested wasteland with no room for normal (and not so normal) people like us.” Alan Keery, who owns the business with his brother Gary, said: “There were children there – they were terrified\". Cereal Killer gained notoriety when it opened last December after a Channel 4 interviewer asked if local people could afford to pay £3.20 for a bowl of cereal . One protester's costume Photo: Pixel8000 Gary Keery said: “It wasn’t as if they were walking past and just happened to stumble upon us. They were deliberately coming here, throwing cereal and shouting ‘gentrification’, ‘anarchy’.” “If they really believe in the protest, why are they covering their face while they’re doing it? Why are they wearing pig masks?\" One arrest was made and one police officer suffered minor facial injuries in the disorder, which happened between 8am and 12.30am, a Metropolitan Police spokesman said. • Boris Johnson: Don’t murder the Cereal Killers – we need people just like them Telegraphtravel Follow @telegraphtravel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T19:54:38.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
