Related Content \nEngineers are moving forward with building the world's biggest twin-engine jetliner. \nThey're calling it the 777-9X, the first aircraft of the 777X family. \nFor air travelers and aviation enthusiasts, there's a lot to be excited about. \nFor one thing, there's the wing: It's big. \nIt's so big, in fact, they had to fold it. \nSpecifically, the 777-9X will have hinges on its wingtips. The hinges will fold up, allowing the plane to shorten its wingspan when it's rolling across airport taxiways. \nIt will be the first design of its kind on any commercial airliner, Boeing says. \nThe plane will have the widest wingspan of any aircraft in the company's 99-year history: 235 feet, 5 inches (71.8 meters). \nTo put it another way: It's wider than four 53-foot (16-meter) semi-truck trailers parked end to end. \nThe hinged wingtips alone will measure 12 feet. Locking pins will prevent them from folding during flight, Boeing tells CNN. \nPrototype testing is expected to get underway soon, Boeing says. \nDuring testing, engineers plan to fine-tune and try to perfect the final design. \nThese giant wings will give the airliner extra lift, like a giant sailplane glider. \nThey'll help the plane save an overall 12 percent more fuel than the Airbus A350, Boeing says. \nInitial versions of the 777 have been flying since the mid-1990s, and the 777X has been in the pipeline for two years already. \nBut the buzz got louder last week when Boeing announced it finalized a basic design. \nDigital cheers popped up all over Twitter and Facebook. \n\"The inside is amazing,\" Rohan Gosh tweeted. \nTwitter user Andres Vallekas expressed his delight with three hearts. \nBigger windows, wider cabins \nLike the wings, the plane's cabin also will be big, Boeing says. \nThe 777-9X will seat at least 400 passengers. That's 34 more than the 777-9X's competitor -- the Airbus A350-1000 -- which holds 366 in a typical three-class configuration. \nThe 777-9X cabin will be 16 inches (40 centimeters) wider than the A350-1000, Boeing says, allowing economy-class seat widths up to 18 inches (46 centimeters). \nTypical airline seat widths range from 17 to 18.5 inches (43 to 47 centimeters). â€¹previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T09:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T16:05:03.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
