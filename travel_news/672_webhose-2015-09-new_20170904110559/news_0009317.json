It was supported by the Adelaide Convention Bureau.\nAdelaide Convention Centre Chief Executive Alec Gilbert said the 1,000 or more delegates attending ICYRAM will inject around $4.4 million into the South Australia economy.\n“The $400 million expansion of the Centre has been a key factor in attracting ICYRAM to\nAdelaide,” said Mr Gilbert.\n“The event is scheduled to utilise the Centre’s new East Building Plenary facilities, which will be completed and opened in 2017.\n“ICYRAM adds to the more than 700 events that have been secured for the expanded Centre including 30 conference events, each with more than 1,000 delegates.\nThey will bring over 70,000 delegates to Adelaide and create in excess of 220,000 bed nights for local hotels.”\nSecuring ICYRAM is also a boost for South Australia’s Advanced Manufacturing sector with opportunities for knowledge sharing and partnerships to be formed between local companies and young global leaders.\nKey conferences themes will align with some of the state’s key research strengths and will include Biomaterials and Health, Engineering and Structural Materials and Materials for Energy Generation, Storage and Harvesting.\n“ICYRAM is a unique opportunity for Adelaide and Australia to link the next generation of scientific leaders with today’s industry,” said Associate Professor Evans.\n“Our aim is to showcase Adelaide as not just a great place to live, but the place where great science and engineering translate into business.”\nSouth Australia’s Chief Scientist Dr Leanna Read said it is a wonderful opportunity to bring our young scientists together with world leaders in the sector.\n“This conference will have the flow on benefit of encouraging more students to consider careers in materials science and other STEM related fields,” said Dr Read.\nSource:- Adelaide Convention Centre", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T18:48:39.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
