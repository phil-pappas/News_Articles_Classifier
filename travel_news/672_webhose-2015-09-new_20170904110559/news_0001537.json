While the feat in itself is no child’s play, what makes it all the more remarkable is the fact that Mr. Mehta pulls a rickshaw for a living!\nHaving been bitten by the travel bug from an early age, Mr. Mehta’s first trip was to Nepal at the age of 13, when he had to secretly source out Rs 300 from his father to fund his adventure. Keen on exploring different cultures and people on his travels, he recalls with fondness the trips he has made to various states within the country such as Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Kashmir, and Punjab.\nSpeaking on the occasion, spokesperson, TravelTriangle, said, “Wanderlust is an oft-used term today, often erroneous and liberally used. But when TravelTriangle decides to use it to describe someone, you can rest assured that the mantle does not go to the undeserving. While we find excuses to curtail our travelling ambitions due to our mainstream jobs and budgetary issues, Mr. Mehta is a shining example to us of what the thirst to travel can invoke in a person. The whole team at TravelTriangle salutes him and his grand endeavour this World Travel Day, for he truly embodies the very essence of wanderlust.”\nSince he successfully combines his zeal to travel with the financial duty of being a responsible husband and father, Mr. Mehta’s family supports him wholeheartedly in his endeavour. He wishes to keep travelling throughout his life as long as he can, and wants to see even more of the country than he already has. Truly an example to look up to, Mr. Mehta proves that hardship is no deterrent to the strong of spirit, and an indomitable will can overcome any barrier!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T18:42:36.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
