Driven by individual employee and organizational data, this product is designed to scale across an entire company. \nSurePeople's ( www.SurePeople.com ) fully-integrated, cloud-based applications provide organizations across industries and sizes with customized on-demand learning and personalized development plans for all employees -- from front-line workers to leadership teams. \n\"We're officially introducing our solutions at a time when companies need learning, development and hiring applications that are scalable, affordable, personalized, driven by real data and analytics from people themselves, and deliver a real return on investment,\" says Niko Drakoulis, the Founder and CEO of SurePeople. \nThe innovative platform creates a data-driven learning culture for companies that is engaging, collaborative and employee-driven. Key features include: Individual Data: The SurePeople PRISM ™, a personal assessment built on psychometric testing standards and decades of scientific research. As the only assessment that reveals an employee's Emotional, Relational and Team Intelligence (ERT-i™), it creates a foundation that targets the individual's learning and development needs. Organizational Insights: The SurePeople PULSE ™ delivers real-time data for organizations through custom 360 assessments for employees or customers and surveys on company culture, leadership strength and engagement. These insights give companies greater visibility across their talent pipeline and align the learning needs of an employee with the needs of a business. Personalized Learning and Development Plans : An automated plan for each employee that features over 60 practice areas designed by executive coaches, with strategies and direction based on the 70:20:10 model for Learning & Development. Users access an on-demand multimedia library filled with curated and customized content to support each learner. Performance and Analytics : A suite of tools that provide employees with real-time feedback on their professional development, evaluate their growth through self-assessments, and foster a socially collaborative experience through recognition and endorsements. In addition, company leaders get instant access to all learning and development activities to measure their return on investment. \nSurePeople has also released its intelligent hiring application. Companies can use the PRISM assessment to support hiring decisions; match and compare candidates; and short-form assessments for references which will outline a candidate's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. \nAccording to the Global Human Capital Trends 2015 report by Deloitte , learning and development is a top three issue for companies. The report, which surveyed more than 3,300 business and human resource leaders worldwide, reveals that companies are struggling to develop leaders at all levels as they confront increasing skills gaps. \nJosh Bersin, founding principal of Bersin by Deloitte and an expert in business-driven learning, HR and talent management, notes that there is a need to revamp and improve employee learning. According to Bersin, research shows that companies with high performing learning environments rank high in employee engagement. \n\"Our technology and leadership team is poised to reinvent the learning experience for companies, and to bring a fragmented landscape of learning and human analytics into focus and alignment in one cloud-based platform,\" says Drakoulis. \"We've been working and innovating with several Fortune 500 companies across industries. The feedback gathered during our year-long soft launch phase with select industry leaders has been extremely positive. \" \nKarlin Sloan, Founder and CEO of Sloan Group International , says, \"SurePeople has created a technology solution that brings the learning and development marketplace into a whole new paradigm of efficacy -- and modernizes how we manage people.
