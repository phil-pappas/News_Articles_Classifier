Shuttles and buses already at the venue got stuck in the mud, frustrating non-campers even further. \nRevellers were left stranded in the cold and rain for hours. Many walked over 15 kilometres to find a way out of the forest where the event was held, but hundreds eventually gave up and went to sleep on the grass @TomorrowWorld all the people like these girls that literally slept in the cold mud pic.twitter.com/SPiu8uWGoH — pocahontas (@EDMPocahontas) September 27, 2015 \n\"We saw people peppered on the sides of the road who had given up from exhaustion,\" Elizabeth Feindel told The Huffington Post. \nFestivalgoer Valerie told Mashable she and her friends waited in line for a shuttle for over two hours, and were then told by organisers to walk several kilometres to another checkpoint for buses. \"It was unfair for them to tell us to 'keep walking, there are shuttles a few miles down the road' when they already knew all of them had been cancelled,\" she said. \nOrganisers say TomorrowWorld will offer refunds for Sunday's ticketholders after bad weather made the event inaccessible to them on the final day. Officials said that the tickets will be refunded entirely and automatically, including service, shipping and payment fees. Big shout out to @TomorrowWorld for leaving 10 thousand people stranded for hours. I really felt like the VIP I paid for. — 808 Emcee (@808_Emcee) September 27, 2015 glad I didn't goto #TomorrowWorld , woke up to messages from friends begging me to pick them up walking the streets #stranded @TomorrowWorld — Gary Brown (@gbro76) September 27, 2015 Lesson to @TomorrowWorld The ultimate experience doesn't end at the last song. Leaving 10k people #stranded will be all I remember. — Brad Jansen (@Brad_J_Jansen) September 27, 2015 Part 4: The #irony is @uber and @tmobile were partners of @TomorrowWorld No cars and no mobile service at the uber pick up point", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T08:51:36.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
