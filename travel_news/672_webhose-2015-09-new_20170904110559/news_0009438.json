Emma Sumner shares the magic tools she's developed to cater for her coeliac daughter on holiday. Bring gluten-free bread mix in your luggage; it's quick, easy and surprisingly tasty By Emma Sumner Comments \n“Wizout gluten?” The Austrian waiter’s face betrayed his impatience as he glanced at the other families waiting to be seated in the alpine restaurant. Since our seven-year-old daughter, Annabel, was diagnosed as coeliac two years ago, I’ve become familiar with this blank response. \nCoeliac disease, as I swiftly learnt, is not an allergy or an intolerance, but a lifelong disease in which the immune system attacks the intestines when even the smallest amount of gluten is absorbed. And gluten is to be found almost everywhere on a menu. \nEven if what you order doesn’t have gluten, the ingredients for your food have often been in contact with other products containing gluten in the restaurant kitchen. Throw in a foreign location, and another language, and travelling abroad with a coeliac child poses a number of challenges for a family. Navigating the buffet \nOnce Annabel was diagnosed, we soon learned that there are few right or wrong approaches, just the least problematic. \nBuffet dining rooms, the stalwart of the Boden-mother-on-strike, were once just about endurable when staying at large family club hotels. Now, I see them as minefields of mixed serving spoons and confused kitchen staff. \nHotels may offer assurance ahead of time that they will cater for a gluten free diet. One we stayed in, above the hills in Malaga, reassured us, and it delivered: in the form of one small, bone-dry gluten-free bread roll , ceremoniously delivered to the table with silver tongs at each meal. \nThere is little understanding about the issues of cross-contamination for Annabel. An enthusiastic chalet girl at a family ski company once expressed delight at being given gluten-free pancake ingredients. She noted, after serving, how well it had blended in with her usual mix. \nAnd the irritable Austrian waiter? To his credit, he displayed an admirable knowledge of London geography, as he retorted: “We are in Obergurgl , not Notting Hill”. \nCharming: 'We are in Obergurgl, not Notting Hill' Photo: Anton Klocker Is self-catering the only option? \nAs a working mother, I had always had a non-negotiable requirement that holidays involve no shopping, cooking or clearing of meals - allowing me to spend more time with the children and relaxing. However, with coeliac disease, the sybaritic possibility of wandering up to a beachside taverna for an unscheduled lunch with little else to trouble the afternoon save the consideration of which quayside restaurant to try out in the evening seemed to be beyond our reach. \nOr was it? Assiduous in my pursuit of a compromise, we alighted upon three tools to support my position as Off-Duty Mum: bread, tin foil and barbeque. \nPaul Hollywood it was not, but the suitcase of gluten free basics which accompanied us to the villa contained a large number of vacuum-packed, gluten-free baguettes and rolls from home, which could be transformed into a hot dog picnic on the beach. Just as usefully, if we did eat at a beachside restaurant, we wrapped them in our foil and handed them to the restaurant to heat up as a substitute for chips. The foil also came in handy to wrap around a restaurant’s fresh fish or meat, to keep it safely separated from other potential contaminants. \nPacket bread mix is also invaluable, allowing me to produce a produced a fresh loaf back at the villa with an ease that would make the Bake Off blush. Add a little water and oil to the mix, allow two hours for rising, and you then get a surprisingly tasty bread which supplemented meals and which Annabel enjoyed fighting off the rest of her family for (not an experience she often has with her food substitutes). \nAnd the barbeque? The foiled-up, contamination-free, outdoor oven that produces delicious meals with no need for a sauce? That, I’m afraid, was as much about me taking a back seat on the cooking front, allowing my husband to step up. \nSince Annabel was diagnosed, we’ve been to Spain, Austria, France, Corsica, Greece, Mauritius and Norway. We’ve found that in countries that are more friendly towards children, generally, such as Italy and Spain, restaurant workers are likely to be more willing to go out of their way to help. Italy – with its pasta, pizza and all that coeliacs must avoid – has an unusually high incidence of coeliac, and testing is now compulsory in schools – so there is a high availability of gluten-free food. Tips for travel with coeliac children Websites such as GlutenFreeTraveller.com and GlutenFreeGlobeTrotter.com are useful for researching destinations. When you’ve decided on your destination, carry out further research into where gluten free foods are sold locally. There are many coeliac travellers who post information on useful supermarkets and local stores - just google the destination with \"coeliac\". Pack a large amount of gluten free staples which can be used to fall back on, such as pasta, vacuum-packed bread rolls and baguettes, bread mix, cereal and endless snacks. They can always be brought back home. Print out a gluten free card in the local language for use in restaurants. Don’t feel limited by a restaurant menu. It is often possible to discuss options such as meat or fish or a jacket potato without sauce or accompaniments. Similarly, don’t be afraid to bring your own food, such as pre-cooked pasta or bread to accompany the main course. \nHave you taken your child with coeliac diesease on holiday?
