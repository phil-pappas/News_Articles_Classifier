Domestic travel was down -8.5% while international passenger figures showed a 0.9% increase on 2014 levels. Helicopter traffic remained below 2014 levels, at -6.6% for the month.\nCarol Benzie, Airport MD said “We report a mixed set of figures this month with heli traffic and domestic travel showing a reduction on 2014’s record figures. International traffic has received a boost with our busy summer charter flights and with the popularity of Wizz Air’s new Gdansk route”.\nSeptember has seen a busy start to the month with the airport welcoming thousands of visitors to the city for Offshore Europe 2015. Over 25,000 passengers are expected to pass through the airport over the four days of the conference.\nSource:- Aberdeen International Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T01:51:44.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
