The labour commissioner has to consent before they can implement the plan,\" the source said.\nMining firms are required by law to notify the government when planning to reduce jobs, another source at the ministry of mines said.\n\"They are still engaging the unions and other stakeholders like the government, so that number can’t be final,\" the second source said.\nGlencore had raised the amount of money it planned to invest in Mopani to almost $1bn from $500m over the next 18 months to improve efficiency, the source said.\nMopani’s spokesman Cephas Sinyangwe declined to comment on the planned job cuts and the proposed investment.\nPresident Edgar Lungu’s spokesman Amos Chanda said that government officials had met executives at Glencore and Mopani to urge them to follow the law while implementing the job cuts.\n\"We don’t want a lot of jobs to be lost but we welcome Glencore’s plans to invest huge amounts of money in Mopani to enable it to withstand shocks like the current one,\" Mr Chanda said.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T21:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T18:03:59.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
