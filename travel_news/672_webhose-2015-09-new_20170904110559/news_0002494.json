The planning needs to be even more meticulous if you are planning on Grand Canyon rafting. The area is so popular such that the national park service allows only one trip per tourist per year. It is an opportunity of a lifetime; make the most of it. \nThe first thing that you need to do is to determine the type of trip that you want and the duration. There are two broad categories to choose from; commercial and non-commercial trips. The commercial trips are a package that includes professional guidance through the entire experience. You need to reserve your spot at least one year in advance. Noncommercial or private trips, on the other hand, are self-guided. These are usually given to the public after a weighted lottery. \nThere are several companies that have been licensed to organize the trips. The length usually varies from one to fifteen nights. You will chose your preferred package from a list of those presented. Nights are usually spent in camps created by the river bank. Get in touch with the Grand Canyon national park so that you can get the necessary permits in good time. This may be a year or two in advance. \nYou will have different craft types to choose from including oar, motor, paddle or dory. The choice will of course depend on your abilities. Motor boats are the fastest. Most are large enough to hold up to 20 people at a go. They usually run smoothly through the rapids. Their main downside is that they are quite noisy at times. \nOar boats can accommodate four or five passengers. They usually have guides to do the rowing as you enjoy the ride. Paddle boats are a bit rare. With paddle boats, the passengers have to help with the paddling. You can choose different types for different sections of your trip so as to have a feel of each. The total group size at any given point in time is up to 30 people. This means that you will travel in several boats with support boat reserved for carrying any extra gear. \nIt is not mandatory for one to have previous rafting experience. It recommended, however, that you be in good physical condition. Spare some time to work out a bit on the few weeks leading up to the trip. The lower age limit for one to participate is 12 years. Some may allow younger children up to 8 years but only for motorized boats. \nOnce you have booked and made travel arrangements, get in touch with your company so as to get instructions on what exactly will be required of you. Most companies will provide essential gear that includes sleeping bags, tents and lifejackets. Ensure that you book lodging well in advance to avoid last minute inconveniences. You will be required to arrive a day before the trip. \nThe site is also a great spectacle and is as a matter of fact considered one of the wonders of the world. Among the features to look out for in the area are the exposed strata that rise more than a mile above the river. These strata are laden with geological history. There are different types of ecosystems throughout the length of the canyon. \nIf you are looking for information about Grand Canyon rafting , you should pay a visit to our web pages here today.
