When you are ready to field overnight, you can choose a tent, sleeping bag, waterproof cloth, hole or refuge hut. And the tent is the most commonly used, because it is easy to set up, rainproof and repeated use, also can be set to any location and wind, sun, selectivity is also very much, such as polyester dome tent, pop up tent, family tent and so on have enough space for climbing place the equipment.The tent is mainly composed of four parts: internal and external accounts, support, account, packaging and accessories, in addition to the design of the tent and support method is an important technical indicators.The outer tent is the protective layer of the tent, the tent outside the tent is a coated nylon fabric. Rain proof performance of the coating thickness and quality decide the tent, nylon cloth texture performance in durable ripstop degree, external impression is also very important.The most common tent coating is PU coating, PU is a polymer organic material, PU coating is a stable, low temperature resistant coating, commonly used in various fabrics. The thickness of the PU coating and the coating technology determine the waterproof property of the fabric, and the thickness of the coating is indicated by mm, which indicates that the static water column height of the coating is highly.The texture of the nylon tent mainly depends on the quality, the density of the fabric, the dyeing technology and the textile technology. Codura nylon fabric, like the American DuPont Co, has a wear resistance of several times more than that of ordinary nylon. From the density of 170T, 190T, 210D and more high textile number of nylon fabric.Inner tent relatively much simpler, low-grade nylon tent Inner tent cloth or gauze generally, in the upscale tent Inner tent using dense fine gauze, guarantee good air permeability and anti-mosquito function.The support is the support frame of the tent, the commonly used material is the glass and aluminum alloy, the glass fiber reinforced plastic frame, glass fiber and polymer resin polymer, light weight, high strength, good formability, has a certain bending, become the common materials used in tent. Its performance depends on the quality and diameter of the glass fiber, the bigger the diameter, the higher the weight, the more weight.At the end of the account, there is a waterproof and strong wear resistance, and the common use of the end of the material for the PE fabric and waterproof polyester cloth. PE tent, waterproof polyester cloth used in middle and low grade tent.PE is a polyethylene material, looks similar to low-grade snakeskin, using actual tent is two-sided to attach a waterproof film PE material, including a large number of export tent use the material. At the end of the account, because of the direct contact with the ground, easy to be crushed by the rubble, the root of the tree branches scratch and damage, prevention of the way there are 2:1, choose the formation of Camp Camp, self supporting tent to clean the floor;2, is the use of tents, tents, tents to the general use of 420D wear resistant Oxford cloth, laying on the ground to form a protective layer.For more details, please click www.welfulloutdoors.com Rating:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T10:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T12:17:05.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
