Friendly people, a variety of great vacation spots, and some of the world’s most famous landmarks come together to make it a superb destination for any type of traveler.\nAgoda’s hotel teams looked at accommodation in four of the country’s top destinations and gathered a list of those offering special prices. Travelers looking to explore Cambodia’s labyrinthine, constantly evolving capital of Phnom Penh will have no trouble finding a great place to stay. Agoda customers rave about the Central Market and evening strolls along Sisowath Quay, plus a young but exciting food scene.\nThere are great deals in Kep and Sihanoukville as well, both of them popular beach resorts with great food and a wonderful, rustic charm from the pre-Khmer Rouge days, when the towns popped with glitzy mansions and swanky resorts.\nAnd a visit to Cambodia wouldn’t be complete without seeing the stunning temple ruins in and around Siem Reap. The Angkor complex and its associated temples and ruins are globally famous and rightly so. Visit the huge main temple of Angkor, or the smaller but no less impressive structures of Bayon, Banteay Srei, or Ta Phrom, the “Tomb Raider” temple, among many others.\nTourist high season has not yet begun, so it’s a great time to visit Cambodia when the crowds are at their most manageable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T13:57:13.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
