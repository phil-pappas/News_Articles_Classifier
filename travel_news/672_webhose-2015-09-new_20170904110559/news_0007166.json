The Euskotren burrows its way through the Pyrenean foothills to the border town of Irun, then over the River Bidasoa into France and the resort of Hendaye (journey time: 37 minutes). In the other, westerly, direction, it runs to Bilbao, just too far for a viable day trip. Worth a visit, however, are the seaside towns of Zumaia, where you can comb for fossils along the geologically unique rock-strata beaches, and Zarautz (pictured) with its long sandy beach. The Euskotren runs from Donostia-Amara station, Plaza Easo 9 and the service is half-hourly. Roger Chappell wins a £250 Railbookers voucher More feedback from readers The king who made waves I am not surprised that King Canute chose Bosham as the site of his manor house or that he ventured down to the sea there (“ Mystery on the millennial trail of King Canute ”, September 19). I went to a great wedding at the Millstream Hotel in Bosham. It was a lovely place to stay. The little harbour with its shops and pubs is as pleasant a spot as anywhere along the South Coast. The church from the outside is hard to recognise in the depiction on the Bayeux Tapestry, but once inside the distinctive arch clearly resembles the one on the tapestry. Although only the name survives from the 11th century, Knutsford is also associated with King Canute. Was Canute the founder of this fine Cheshire town? I believe there is a local tradition that he built the ford on the river there. It’s tempting to think he could have used it as a base situated on the border between the earldoms of Northumbria and Mercia when he was asserting his authority far away from his stronghold on the Sussex coast. Richard Sauvain Namibia offers extreme remoteness Namibian highs As Tom Bradby observed, Namibia is wonderful (“ Laptops off, adventures on ”, September 19). But the best way to get around is by chartered light plane. It’s not expensive if costs are shared and great fun. Moreover you see thrice as much and can get to remote locations. Comment posted online Walk on the wild side I agree with Tim Jepson: walking is one of life’s great joys - and it is free (“ 10 of the world’s greatest walks ”, September 12). It can be done anywhere, anytime and at any speed. Walking in the African bush has everything. An early start as the sun rises coincides with the nocturnal residents seeking shade. The world is alive with beauty and the promise of a new day as one walks quite slowly and cautiously through short scrubby grass and scattered bushes. Of course there are animals but they will be more scared of you than you should be of them. Antelope will snort and bound out of your way, a fat, glossy zebra could look at you and trot off, an elephant might wander across your path – watch it go and wonder at its majesty. Birds will be everywhere bidding others to wake up and embrace the dawn. You just might catch a glimpse of a sleepy lion collapsing under a bush after a busy night’s hunting, or a herd of buffalo moving off in search of some fresh grazing. Treat them all with caution and respect and they will reward you with a truly memorable walk. Mark Milbank Gourmet Caribbean The Caribbean is not commonly thought of as a destination for a foodie holiday but your experts missed an opportunity to highlight some amazing cuisine in a stunning setting in their guide to 50 of the best holidays in the Caribbean (September 19). Grand Case, a small village in French St Martin, has a clear, calm bay lined with fabulous restaurants. I dined at many of them when I lived on nearby Saba. I remember feasting on seared foie gras with morels and orange sauce, followed by a chocolate cherry tart laced with armagnac at Escapade while gazing at bobbing sailboats. The standard of cooking is very high at all the restaurants, with reasonable prices too. Most of the restaurants surrounding the bay are built on stilts. The high tide washes the sea under the restaurants, with water so shallow that you can see fish swimming beneath you. You can find a list of restaurants in Grand Case at grandcase.com.
