The next highest was Geneva on £145 after a 5 per cent dip.\nThe lowest prices paid by UK travellers in Europe were in the Baltic states, with Vilnius on £55 after a 10% dip and Riga losing 12% to £56.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe", "http://hpi.hotels.com/uk-h12015/"], "published": "2015-09-04T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T15:34:10.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
