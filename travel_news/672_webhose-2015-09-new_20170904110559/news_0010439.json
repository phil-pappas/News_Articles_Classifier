Officers found the 25-year-old man at Second Avenue and Spring Street, ordered him to drop his gun, then shot him in the hand. Contains graphic language and content.\nPolice saw the man running west on Spring Street and two officers, following in their patrol car, ordered the man to drop the gun, the news release said. The two officers got out of their car at Second Avenue and Spring Street, ordering the man to drop the weapon and get on the ground.\n When the man didn’t follow their commands, one officer fired several times, striking the man in the hand, police said.\nOn a patrol-car video released by the department’s media-relations office on Tuesday, officers can be seen driving in search of the man. Once they found him they yelled “Drop it, police.” One officer can be seen yelling “drop the gun” repeatedly before and after firing.\nThe 25-year-old man was taken to Harborview Medical Center with nonlife-threatening injuries. Officers said the handgun the man had been holding was actually a “realistic-looking pellet gun,” police said.\nIn the second shooting, officers were called to the Northgate area around 4:45 a.m. to investigate a report of a man breaking into a car. The car owner gave officers a detailed description of the man, Seattle police spokesman Patrick Michaud said.\nOfficers found the suspect and ran after him. Near Roosevelt Way Northeast and Northeast 100th Street, the man threatened officers with a knife, he said.\nThese dashcam videos show Seattle police investigating a report of a man breaking into a car. Officers found the suspect, ran after him, were threatened with a knife, shot him with a taser, then shot him. Contains graphic language.\nAn officer shot the man with a stun gun, “but it fired and had no effect,” Michaud said.\nOne officer then fired several rounds, striking the suspect.\nThe man “was alert and conscious” when taken to Harborview Medical Center, Michaud added.\nOn a video released by police, officers can be heard on patrol-car video yelling “Put it down” at the man and the man responding “hell, no.” The audio soon cuts out because the suspect led officers out of the camera range.\nBoth officers who fired have been placed on administrative leave, per department policy.\n“We feel there is a lot of value for the public to see these videos as close to the incident as possible,” said Seattle police Sgt. Sean Whitcomb. “We work very hard to release these videos in the interest of transparency and openness.”\nAll police shootings are investigated by the department’s Force Investigation Team (FIT). The team is part of the department’s use-of-force policy negotiated between the Seattle Police Department (SPD) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), which concluded in 2011 that Seattle police resort to force too quickly and routinely use too much when they do.\nThere have been two other officer-involved shootings in Seattle this year.\nOn Aug. 25, Seattle police shot and wounded a man at a homeless encampment after he allegedly fatally beat a homeless woman and wounded her husband.\nOn July 17, Samuel Smith was fatally shot in Ravenna after he charged an officer with a knife. Police had been looking for Smith, 27, because he was believed to have been involved in a hit-and-run accident in which a police car was struck on Interstate 5, police said.\nInformation from Seattle Times archives is included in this story.Jennifer Sullivan: 206-464-8294 or jensullivan@seattletimes.com .
