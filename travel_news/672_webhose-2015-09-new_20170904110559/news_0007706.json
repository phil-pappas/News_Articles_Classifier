Further information can be found at http://www.capitaldrivertraining.co.uk \nUnited Kingdom , 22 September 2015 -- \nHow Capital Driver Training’s New Service Proudly Risks Defying Convention \nEarlier today, Capital Driver Training finally announced the beginning of its new Intensive Driving Course service, which has been in development since 2006. The main aim is to help people learn to drive in record time with minimum expense ... but it does so, with a difference. Sean Burns, Owner at Capital Driver Training, says: “We wanted to try something new with this Intensive Driving Course service. Anyone familiar with the Driving School market will probably have noticed how everyone else seems to teach learners to drive over many months costing a lot more money than necessary. This is a problem because leaner drivers often end up disillusioned with the learning process.” So as a welcome breath of fresh air, Capital Driver Training will instead offer the opportunity to learn to drive over a shorter time period. Capital Driver Training chose to make this move because we believe that people want choice. People’s lifestyles vary. Many people need to learn to drive quickly for various reasons- some need a driving license for their job while others have very busy lives and can’t commit to driving lessons for months on end. Sean Burns also said “We want to give our customers more choice. With our new Intensive Driving Course service, they have a fresh new possibility. We want them to feel like they have made the right choice when using our service. Trying something new is always a risk, but it’s a risk we believe is worth taking.” Capital Driver Training has been in business for for 9 years, being established in June 2006. Since Day 1 it has always aimed to Help people to learn to drive efficiently. The new Intensive Driving Course service is set to launch Immediately.
