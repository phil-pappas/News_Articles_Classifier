Diaz, the Houston Aviation Director. \"We are confident this new partnership will help strengthen the connection between the two centers and create possibilities for future growth that are virtually unlimited.\" \nThe Calgary-based airline will fly one daily round-trip flight on a Boeing 737 aircraft, departing from the Canadian airport at 10:25 a.m. (local time) and arriving in Houston at 3:22 p.m. (local time). \"As the two largest oil cities in North America, Calgary-Houston is the most-requested route from our corporate travel clients in Western Canada,\" said Chris Avery, WestJet Vice-President, Network Planning, Alliances and Corporate Development. \"And because of the challenges facing the energy sector today, there has never been a better time to take a serious look at our lower fares, amenities in Plus, the benefits of our WestJet Rewards program, and our ever-expanding network of destinations.\" \nWestJet is the latest in the growing international service at Bush Intercontinental. Already this year, Houston has welcomed new international service from Volaris, Vacation Express, All Nippon Airways and EVA Air and expanded service from several existing airlines. Later this year, Air New Zealand will begin nonstop service to Auckland, New Zealand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T01:41:47.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
