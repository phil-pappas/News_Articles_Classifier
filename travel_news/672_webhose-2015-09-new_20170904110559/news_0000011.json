Watch in Times Video » \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Think Left Bank, and the Latin Quarter and the Eiffel Tower spring to mind. The Right Bank, which is twice the size, has no clear identity. There are, in fact, many Right Banks. There is the Old Regime Right Bank, both monumental and orderly, with some of the city’s best-known sites — the Louvre , the Tuileries Gardens and the Palais Royal. There is the intimate, disorderly Marais, and the elegant open spaces of the revolutionary Right Bank (with the Bastille and Place de la Concorde, where Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and Robespierre were guillotined). And there is the 19th-century financial Right Bank with its grand boulevards, covered arcades and department stores. Meanwhile, Right Bank villages like Montmartre, Passy and Belleville that were added to the city only in 1860 have struggled ever since to hold on to their local identities. Below is a selection of places that will let you discover the Right Bank’s multiple personalities. Friday See More » The Musée Carnavalet, housed in two adjacent mansions, is the most Parisian of Paris museums. Rent the five-euro audio guide (about $5.50 at $1.10 to the euro), head to the third floor and revel in the largest collection of works on the French Revolution: paintings, sculptures, relics, miniatures, scale models of guillotines, weapons, even a replica of the Bastille prison carved from one of its stones. A copy of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and a reconstruction of Louis XVI’s prison cell with mementos of his life are there. Other treasures include the armchair in which the philosopher Voltaire died, Marcel Proust’s cork-lined bedroom from his Right Bank apartment and dugout canoes used by the Parisii tribe on the Seine.

Steak Frites | 7:30 p.m. Feel at home with a good steak frites in an old-fashioned bistro. Poulette does it right. Opened in the late 19th century as a small cafe, it is now a Paris insider’s destination. The site, with its zinc bar and section of black-and-white tiled floor, has been designated a historic monument. Belle Époque scenes in ceramic tiles framed in orchids and cherries — one an ode to beer, another to coffee — dominate the main room. Steak frites: 19.50 euros. 3. Paris La Nuit | 9 p.m. Paris at night is magical, so rush to get to the Cour Carrée — the perfectly proportioned, 16th- and 17th-century courtyard at the east end of the Louvre — before it closes at 9:45 for lovely views. Peek through the archways to see the Louvre’s illuminated I. M. Pei pyramid to the west, the St.-Germain l’Auxerrois Church to the east, the Rue de Rivoli to the north and the Institut de France to the south. From there, head for the pyramid in the center of the adjacent Cour Napoléon and stroll to the spot at the eastern end of the Tuileries where you can see the obelisk, the Arc de Triomphe and the La Défense arch. Then just wander, perhaps to the riverbank beneath the Pont de la Tournelle where Woody Allen and Goldie Hawn danced at the end of the film “Everyone Says I Love You”; and the Square du Vert-Galant , the westernmost tip of the Île de la Cité, which offers a view of the Louvre on the right, and the dome of the Institut de France on the left. Access the river down the stairs at the equestrian statue of Henri IV on the Pont Neuf.

A Small Palace | 10 a.m. Head to the Petit Palais museum with its small but wonderful collection of fine 19th-century Impressionist and Belle Époque paintings. Check out the Art Nouveau dining room designed by the architect Hector Guimard in the basement. The museum’s cafe-garden offers a respectable breakfast amid palm trees and sculptures and mosaic floors lit from below. 5 . I Have Everything | 11:30 a.m. G. Detou is pronounced j’ai de tout, which means “I have everything.” There is always something to discover at this little épicerie; it has a beautiful selection of cake and pastry decorations, including tiny silver dragées and violet-infused leaves of sugar. There are natural liquid aromas, pistachio and rose pastes and emulsifiers. Kilo bags of dried fruits and nuts are perfect to take as snacks on long walks. A selection of sardines and tuna in pretty tins (about 3 euros each) and Edmond Fallot stone-ground mustard, packaged in a decorative tin pail (about 3 euros) are perfect gifts. 6 . Covered Passage | 1 p.m. Slip into the 19th century in the city’s covered passages. These were Paris’s first shopping malls: enclosed, heated spaces with gas lighting, cafes, restaurants and an array of goods and services. Before department stores took over, there were over 100 of these iron-columned, glass-covered structures; only a score or so survive. Have lunch at the Philippe Starck-decorated Caffè Stern (in the Passage des Panoramas, the oldest surviving arcade, built in 1800). The coffeehouse-restaurant-wine bar, originally an engraving and printing atelier, offers updated Italian classics, including steamed Mediterranean pizza and whipped potatoes served in a large coffee mug with Bolognese sauce (16 euros each) and the best espresso in Paris (2.50 euros). Lunch from 38 to 100 euros per person. Photo St.-Gervais-St.-Protais, in the Marais, offers a 30-minute Vespers every Saturday. Credit Alex Cretey-Systermans for The New York Times 7. Shops and Churches | 3 p.m. The lively Passage Jouffroy on the other side of Boulevard Montmartre features the Librairie du Passage, one of the oldest bookstores in Paris. Ask Jean-Luc Langlaude, the owner, to show you the secret collection in his private upstairs office with its Art Nouveau windows. A must for cheap souvenirs is Paris Est Toujours Paris (the winner is the 5-euro Paris dish towel). Find a luscious secondhand dress (a Cacharel silk sundress may cost 50 euros) at La Marelle. A must — with no sign or apparent name or website — is Galerie Vivienne at the entrance at 6, rue Vivienne. There you will find antique maps, prints, books and photographs. From there, enter a world overlooked even by Parisians themselves: its churches. Every Saturday at 6 p.m., St.-Gervais-St.-Protais in the heart of the Marais offers a 30-minute singing of Vespers. The voices of the white-robed nuns and monks fill the space. If there’s time, head to the vast St.-Eustache near Les Halles. “The Life of Christ,” a triptych bathed in bronze and white gold patina by the American artist Keith Haring, sits in a side chapel. 8 . The Wine Comes First | 8 p.m. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T01:27:43.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
