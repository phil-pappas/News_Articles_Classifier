Credit: Byron Keulemans \nCape Town student Chaeli Mycroft has become the first female quadriplegic to summit Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. \nChaeli is an ability activist who co-founded The Chaeli Campaign . \n\"After watching the stationary tracker for what feels like hours we have received confirmation from Discover Africa that 7 climbers, including Chaeli, reached Uhuru Peak between 07h28 and 08h37,\" Chaeli's mother and CEO of The Chaeli Campaign Zelda Mycroft said on the Discover Africa site . \nChaeli was accompanied by a team of climbers. \nThey achieved their goal of climbing the mountain in only seven days. \nBut what was the aim of the climb? \nTo raise funds in support of The Chaeli Campaign's Inclusive Education Programme and The Chaeli Cottage Inclusive Preschool and Enrichment Centre. \nFinally reaching the summit, Chaeli and her team's efforts have proved to be fruitful.
