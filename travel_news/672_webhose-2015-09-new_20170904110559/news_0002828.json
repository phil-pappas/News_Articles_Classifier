(JGM) headquartered in Los Angeles, California have teamed up to bring to cities across the globe something never experienced before: low-cost, high-speed, elevated Personal Rapid Transit (PRT). JGM is a global project and construction management firm offering a comprehensive array of transportation and other services to public and private sectors. JGM specializes in program, project and construction management, urban planning, and architectural design in the fields of transportation infrastructure, civic, educational, institutional, residential and commercial facilities.\nIn his public comments, skyTran Chairman and CEO, Jerry Sanders noted, “The challenges to an urban environment and infrastructure posed by an increasingly complex society require a team committed to service and excellence. JGM, a company that for the past three decades has maintained a position of leadership in the infrastructure and transportation sector, is now part of this team.”\nJGM has been a global leader in conceiving and managing complex projects worldwide. Among them: the Downtown Transit Center & Community Administration building in Houston, Texas — a $12 million project; the Alameda Corridor, which is a direct 20 mile freight train rail link — a $2.2 billion project; and the Hollywood-Highland Station located in Hollywood, California — a $40 million project that brought mass transit to the city of Los Angeles.\nJGM Chairman and CEO, Earl Gales, Jr. remarked, “We are proud to be a partner of skyTran, as we know this is the first and only viable mass transit solution to solve worldwide congestion. No other system is safer, greener, and more affordable. In the same manner that cars and airplanes were disruptors to the status quo, so will skyTran make the Earth a better place to reside in and move about.”\nskyTran is the developer of a patented PRT system consisting of a network of computer-controlled, two-person “jet-like” vehicles employing unique, state-of-the-art, skyTran Magnetic Levitation (STML) technology. skyTran moves passengers in a fast, safe, green, and economical manner. Together, skyTran and JGM provide the knowledge and experience necessary to bring the system to cities worldwide.\n# # #\nIf you would like more information about this topic or to schedule an interview with skyTran CEO, Jerry Sanders, please contact Roger Margulies at 650-319-8619, rmargulies(at)skytran(dot)us.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:13:20.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
