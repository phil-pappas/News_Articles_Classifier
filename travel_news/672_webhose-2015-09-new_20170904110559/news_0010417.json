On September 29 in Warsaw, media will be invited on board the aircraft for a 30-minute flight above the city to experience the aircraft’s modern, sophisticated cabin before landing back at Chopin Airport.\n“Bombardier is excited to showcase this class-leading product to operators in the region,” said Christophe Degoumois, Vice President, Sales, Europe, Russia and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Bombardier Business Aircraft. “The Challenger 350 aircraft offers one of the widest, most spacious cabin in its category and boasts larger windows and a more advanced HD Cabin Management System. It is perfectly suited for the requirements of business jet travellers in Poland,” he added.\nNot only does the Challenger 350 aircraft feature the very latest in avionics functionality but it offers the segment’s most advanced cabin that maximizes natural light and redefines interior comfort and design sophistication, all while maintaining the performance attributes that have become synonymous with the Challenger family. It is easily differentiated on the ramp with its canted winglets, which, coupled with higher thrust engines, give the Challenger 350 aircraft more performance, more efficiency and lower direct operating costs than its competitors*.\nThe Challenger 350 jet, certified in Poland, builds upon the legendary segment defining clean-sheet Challenger 300 jet and boasts class-defining performance. New engines and canted winglets increase the aircraft’s range to 3,200 nautical miles (5,926 kilometers) and enable a direct climb to 13,106 meters (43,000 feet) – raising the bar for its segment. Key city pairs will be well within reach, with the aircraft able to fly eight passengers from Warsaw to Santa Maria (Azores), Tenerife (Canary Islands) or Dubai (United Arab Emirates). Farther afield, you will be able to connect effortlessly with only one stop, Warsaw to New York (New York), Recife (Brazil), Hong Kong (China) or Johannesburg (South Africa).\nSource:- Bombardier", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T15:43:27.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
