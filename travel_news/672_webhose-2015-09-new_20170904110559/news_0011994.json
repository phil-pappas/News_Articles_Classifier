In the last year about 2 million Chinese visited France. Chinese tourists have been travelling all over the world and in 2014 over 100 million Chinese travellers made overseas trips to Japan, South Korea and the United States. Some European countries have been their favourites and France features prominently in their list.\nFrance has seen a 50 percent increase year on year based on the results of the Q12015. Chinese tourists in France have made great contribution in adding to the economy of the country. France has recently felt a drop in visitation from Russian, Japan, the Netherlands and even German tourists owing to an economic slowdown in these countries, however Chinese tourists have made up for the losses. But with the new crisis looming in China, it remains to be seen whether the Chinese will travel with equal vigour.\nBeing the largest source of tourism for France, it is expected that Chinese tourists in a few years from now will increase their annual visitation to 5 million. France has great expectations from the Chinese market and is looking at more prospective options from Chinese inbound tourism.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T17:22:34.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
