When you are on the roads, be alert and drive defensively - making smart decisions could be the difference between a relaxing long weekend and one spent in the emergency room.\"\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates 87 percent of vehicle occupants wear seat belts. The 13 percent of drivers and passengers who do not wear belts accounted for 44.7 percent of fatalities in 2014, according to NHTSA.
