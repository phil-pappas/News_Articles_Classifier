Another of the sculptures has been damaged, with nothing left but a pair of feet. Locals believe that a truck driver may have stolen or damaged one of the steel stick figures, after he became stuck on the lake and used a figurine to help winch the vehicle to safety. The remote inland work, about 500 miles from Perth in Western Australia, attracts visitors from around the world but has proven difficult to protect. Titled Inside Australia, it has been valued at more than £6 million.

Art Sculptures ( Inside Australia ) on Lake Ballard by Antony Gormley, Western Australia Photo: Alamy “Given the remoteness of the site, AGWA relies on our collaboration with the local shire, and also helpful visitors, for any information about incidental damage,” a spokeswoman told The Australian. The installation was commissioned by a Perth arts festival in 2003 and then presented by Gormley as a gift to the state for $1. Vehicles are not supposed to drive on Lake Ballard, where Gormley installed his work. A single sculpture was sold in 2008 for about £180,000.

Gormley has become famous for his public artworks featuring figurines based on the human body , including Another Place, his collection of 100 iron sculptures now on permanent display at Crosby Beach, near Liverpool. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T23:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T04:40:10.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
