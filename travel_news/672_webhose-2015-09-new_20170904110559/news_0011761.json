(The other three are the Philippines, Iraq and Cambodia.)\nThe U.S. came in at No. 14.\nAt the least emotional end of spectrum, countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union dominate.\nGallup measured participants’ daily emotions by asking them whether they experienced any of five positive and five negative human experiences the prior day.\nThe negative experiences were:\nAnger Stress Sadness Physical pain Worry The positive experiences were:\nFeeling well-rested Being treated with respect Enjoyment Smiling and laughing a lot Learning or doing something interesting Gallup interviewed about 1,000 people over age 14 and based its rankings on the average number of “yes” responses to all 10 questions.\nWatch the video of ‘The Most Emotional — and Emotionless — Countries in the World’ on MoneyTalksNews.com.\nBased on those interviews, the 10 most emotional countries are:\nBolivia El Salvador Ecuador Philippines Nicaragua Guatemala Iraq Cambodia Colombia Costa Rica From 59 percent to 57 percent of participants in those countries reported experiencing positive or negative emotions the previous day.\nThe 10 least emotional countries are:\nBangladesh Georgia Azerbaijan Mongolia Sudan Belarus Ukraine Russia Lithuania Kosovo From 37 percent to 41 percent of participants in those countries reported experiencing positive or negative emotions the previous day.\nCulture appears to play a “major role” in these results, according to Gallup. But major events can also have an impact, at least on negative emotions. For example, the organization cites conflicts in Syria and Sudan and the economy in Greece:\nGreece’s economic collapse also created a dramatic increase in negative emotions within the country. Since 2007, the Negative Experience Index score in Greece has doubled, and the country ranks among the top 10 in the world for negative emotions.\nTo see the rest of the rankings, click on the Gallup link above.\nAre you surprised by these rankings?
