We have to make sure consumers getting what they paid for.”\nIn a statement to news.com.au , RL Adams said it was “so focused” on keeping its hens inside during an outbreak of bird flu that it “inadvertently” broke the ACCC’s rules.\n“In effect we are guilty of doing the right thing,” said RL Adams Executive Geoff Sondergeld.\n“We were so focused on the biosecurity issue that we didn’t change our packaging from free range to barn or caged.\n“We are concerned other egg producers could be taken to court inadvertently unless we have a national code covering all issues of the production of eggs that includes both consumer and hen welfare.”\nMr Sondergeld said Darling Downs followed the Australian Model Code of Practice for the Welfare of Animals.\n“When consulting the code Section 2.4.5.3 provides for free range hens not to be ranged when serious outbreaks of disease occur or in instances of severe weather,” he said in the statement.\n“We thought we were doing the right thing and in all honesty didn’t think we had done anything wrong.”\nDarling Downs is calling for a national standard for the egg industry that covers both Australian consumer law and animal welfare standards.\nBut the ACCC’s Rod Sims said the definition of free range was common sense.\n“You can have all the standards you like, but if the birds cannot go outside, there is no way in the world they can be classified as free range.\n“There is a well regarded definition that has come from the courts. That is that the birds must have access to the outdoors and on most days, most birds must feed outdoors. It’s not hard to understand\n“I’d be stumped if you found consumers who think free range means anything other than the birds live outside.”\nDarling Downs Fresh Eggs supplies eggs from farms located in Queensland, approximately 40km south west of Toowoomba. It sold eggs labelled as ‘free range’ to consumers in Queensland, the Northern Territory and New South Wales.\nDarling Downs Fresh Eggs sold eggs under its own ‘Mountain Range’ label and under the ‘Drakes Home Brand Free Range’ label, and supplied to other producers who used them to supplement their own free range supply.\nThe severity of the penalty was mitigated in part by Rl Adams’ co-operation with the ACCC investigation, said the court.\nChicken 23:13 Play video\nDoes the way we raise our chickens affect the food we eat?
