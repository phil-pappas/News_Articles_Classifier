Blistering deserts and cool gardens. Cultured cities and colourful corals. Brilliant beaches and misty mountains. Big skies and big hearts. Whether you’re snorkelling over the Great Barrier Reef, cruising in Sydney Harbour or watching the sunrise over Uluru, you know you’ll never be doing things by halves. But with so much to see, how do you ensure you soak up as many highlights as possible in just one trip? Fortunately, this 20-day Discover Australia tour, part of the Travelmarvel by APT collection, is the perfect solution. You’ll travel at a leisurely pace and enjoy extended stays in carefully chosen destinations. You’ll visit the coastal cities of Perth, Melbourne, Sydney and Cairns, pretty Port Douglas, Alice Springs and Uluru in the Red Centre. You’ll stay in premium accommodation, carefully selected to be central and close to key sights, and a local tour director will take care of everything and work with local experts to bring each destination to life. All the fiddly bits – flights to and from London and within Australia, overseas transfers and so on – are taken care of, so you can relax and enjoy yourself. Amazing Insider Experiences are included in the price – sunrise at Uluru, a day on the Great Barrier Reef, a tour of Sydney Opera House – and combined with gems such as a picturesque cruise on Perth’s Swan River and an appointment with the Flying Doctor. At other times you’ll have free time to follow your own agenda. Relax on four-mile Beach, Port Douglas Your holiday begins with a three-night stay in Perth, sunny, booming and famed for its laid-back Mediterranean lifestyle. It’s the perfect place to unwind and acclimatise and your sightseeing tour will give you the ultimate introduction to the city. Look out over the skyline from King’s Park, explore untouched bushland and discover exotic flora and fauna in the Botanic Gardens, before taking your serene Swan River cruise. You’re actually staying in Perth’s port city of Fremantle and your hotel is perfectly placed to explore the fascinating Fishing Boat Harbour, pretty beaches and colonial buildings. Only a country as vast and varied as Australia could offer the astonishing contrast you’ll experience as you fly to Alice Springs in the rust-red Outback, one of the oldest landscapes on Earth. Sandwiched between the starkly beautiful MacDonnell Ranges, Alice is almost plumb in the middle of the continent. It’s so remote that the Royal Flying Doctor Service and School of the Air do a vital job, as you’ll discover on a special visit. You’ll soon realise that you’re a guest in someone else’s land – the Anangu, Australia’s indigenous people. You’ll have a unique insight into Aboriginal culture as you drive through the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, visit the surreal, rocky domes of Kata Tjuta and walk to Walpa Gorge. Here you can sip a glass of wine as you watch the setting sun stain the sacred rock of Uluru a glowing red. After a night at the Desert Gardens Hotel you’ll be on the spot to witness the equally spectacular sunrise over Uluru before enjoying a guided tour around its base, viewing ancient caves and rock art. Stretch your legs on a trek around Uluru Then the colour palette shifts again as you fly to Cairns amid the sparkling blue seas and lush green rainforests of Tropical North Queensland. In Cairns you’ll enjoy two nights at the stylish Pullman Cairns International in a room with mountain views. Four nights in Sydney at the Amora Hotel Jamison certainly takes some beating Cairns is a pleasure-lover’s paradise and gateway to the Great Barrier Reef, the world’s largest living organism. Enjoy a fast catamaran ride to Reef Magic’s activity platform, where you’ll have five whole hours to snorkel in the coral lagoon, walk through the underwater observatory and join a guided tour in a semi-submersible or glass-bottomed boat to see the riches below the surface. After some free time to explore Cairns you’ll drive north to the chic beach resort of Port Douglas. Here you’ll spend two relaxing days at leisure at the award-winning Peppers Beach Club, like a lush oasis on aptly named Four Mile Beach. Try your hand at kite surfing or visit the world’s oldest living rainforest in Daintree National Park. Stay at the stylish Pullman Cairns International, Queensland Melbourne is the kind of city the ancient Greeks would have approved of, dedicated equally to high culture, fine food and competitive sports, and three nights in the centre of town will give you plenty of opportunity to explore. The first morning you’ll enjoy a sightseeing tour of the city, followed by a tour of the rolling scenery of the Yarra Valley, famed for its chardonnays, pinot noirs and sparkling wines – enjoy a glass with your included winery lunch. There’s also time to do your own thing: immerse yourself in Victoria’s National Gallery, or enjoy a memorable dinner and tour around the city aboard the Colonial Tramcar Restaurant (at own expense). I won’t say the best has been saved until last, but four nights in Sydney at the Amora Hotel Jamison just a short stroll from Darling Harbour certainly takes some beating. On your first day you’ll enjoy a guided tour of some of the city’s most incredible sights then take to the shimmering waters of Darling Harbour on a memorable cruise past some of Sydney’s most treasured sights and landmarks. You’ll step inside the Sydney Opera House for a fascinating behind-the-scenes tour and round off the day in true Aussie fashion with a fish ’n’ chip supper on Bondi Beach. Then you have two days at leisure to explore. You could join one of the Select Experiences (at own expense) such as a seaplane tour of the stunning coastline or climbing the Harbour Bridge. At the farewell drink and dinner on your final evening you’ll be able to toast new-found friends and agree that you’ve all “done Australia”. And what a way to do it.
