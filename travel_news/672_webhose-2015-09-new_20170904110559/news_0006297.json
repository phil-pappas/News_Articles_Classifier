She explains: “More and more, I find our customers have a real love of adventure. \"Last year I received a couple of letters from Saga customers looking for something much more exciting, something off the beaten track. Their words stuck with me: ‘We might be slightly older, but we grew up in the Sixties, and we’re ready for anything.’” When asked why she chose Central America for her next tour, Kathy lights up with enthusiasm. “Because there is so much more to Central America than just beaches! \"So many areas are prepared for tourism and have a great approach to it; it is a vibrant, colourful region and really celebrates the incredible heritage and legacy of the Mayans. Recline of the times: the unmistakable pose of a Mayan chacmool sculpted figure “It’s appealing to a huge variety of people, from those who dream of diving in warm Caribbean waters or exploring the enchanting wonder of the rainforest to those who go to witness some of the most unforgettable historical sites on Earth.” The itinerary is, at times, intrepid but it is a unique experience that’s certainly worth the effort, as Kathy explains: “The Mayan sites are unique, but to enjoy them you need an adventurous spirit – whether it’s climbing steps for amazing views over the jungle, or spending longer on the road. “Our customers are so curious and eager to learn about new cultures that they take it all in their stride and that’s wonderful to see.” For the latest travel news, sign up to the fortnightly Saga Navigator newsletter , or follow @SagaHolidaysUK", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T18:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T12:40:02.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
