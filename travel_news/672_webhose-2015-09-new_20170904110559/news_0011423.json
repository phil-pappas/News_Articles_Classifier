I believe that these experts can be great guides as you make decisions about future travel. Below is a list of tips from seven About Travel experts.\n1. Family Vacations This site is the domain of Suzanne Rowan Kelleher, who has become my best friend among About Travel experts. As a mom who travels with her own kid, I have found Suzanne’s site to be an invaluable resource for everything from trip ideas to keeping my child happy while traveling. My pick from her site is this one, “Smart Parent's Guide to Flying with Kids.” I did my own version of this, “How to be the Best Travel Parent Every Time,” but Suzanne did it better. More »\n2. Budget Travel If I couldn’t write as the air travel expert, I would love to write about budget travel, since I have hundreds of tips.

Caribbean Travel Expert Robert Curley answers that question with his post, “How to Travel to Cuba If You Are an American.” The biggest tip is despite less restrictions, Americans will need to travel with a Cuba travel organization that has an official license from the U.S. State Department, like Insight Cuba or Central Holidays , according to Curley.

One of the toughest things for road warriors is choosing the best suitcase for the task at hand. It’s Dean to the rescue with this article, “How to Pick the Best Suitcase for Travel.” I recommend getting a quality suitcase, but going to discount stores like TJ Maxx or Marshall’s to buy one.

It’s also how I discovered great information from Europe Travel Expert James Martin, who wrote the helpful post “Travel Budgeting - Budget Your Travel to be Frugal, not Cheap.” He offers ways travelers can cut costs but still enjoy a great vacation.

One of my airline friends told me about the iSushi app , which offers recommendations for restaurants around the world. So I was delighted to see Food Travel Expert Akila McConnell’s post, “5 Apps For Travelers With Food Restrictions,” which covers everything from vegetarian/vegan to gluten-free restaurants.
