If you’re not connected to technology, you’re not effectively running your business. And what we think is particularly important is connections to advisers, to the experts who can help a business grow.” For many entrepreneurs, the concept of “connectivity” is inevitably entwined with their social media strategy. And it’s true that platforms like Twitter and Facebook for Business have transformed modern enterprise. “Social media has enabled small businesses to reach a massive audience,” says Ms Jones. “We’re now seeing companies that are almost entirely building their business via Instagram. The beauty of cloud-based applications is that they allow small business owners to stay in touch wherever they are, via mobile devices These platforms are an amazing way for businesses to get their product to market and, furthermore, to connect with customers.” At the same time, businesses are building on free cloud tools and services to help them work more effectively at a very low cost. Canon’s MAXIFY printer range gives SMEs the chance to connect to their printer remotely, using smartphones or tablet devices, via cloud applications. Emma Jones “The beauty of cloud-based applications is that they allow small business owners to stay in touch wherever they are, via mobile devices,” says Ms Jones. “All of this has enabled businesses to be agile, but also to create a professional image on an affordable budget.” One downside to the spread of these free tools and platforms is the abundance of options, says Ms Jones. “Business owners are very busy people. If they’re not developing new products, they’re promoting the brand or managing the finances. It’s always difficult for them to stay on top of the latest business tools, what platform they should be using.” Social media has enabled small businesses to reach a massive audience Entrepreneurs bear some personal responsibility in meeting this challenge, by using business networks and other resources to stay abreast of news and trends. At the same time, says Ms Jones, it’s important to realise that one person can only do so much – and this is where a third kind of connectivity comes into play. “Research suggests that those businesses that connect with experts grow faster than those that don’t,” says Ms Jones. “Our advice to small business is to focus on what you do best and outsource the rest. Know your own field really well, but delegate in the other areas that aren’t your key strengths.” • Win a state-of-the-art Canon printer for your SME »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T23:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T18:37:36.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
