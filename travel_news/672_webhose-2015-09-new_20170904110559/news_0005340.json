The Congress had passed a resolution pledging “to do everything it its power to bring victory to our arms” and the paper observed that that this resolution “was supported in speeches breathing as fervent a spirit of patriotism, and testifying to as firm a grasp of the essentials of the moral situation underlying the state of war, as have been shown in any utterances put on record since the sword of Great Britain was drawn in this tremendous quarrel” whilst praising the speakers “who made it clear that the workers of this country put victory in the war above all other considerations and will have no dealings with the contemptible propaganda of the several tiny cliques who are advertising their half-baked intellectualism up and down the country.” The TUC was doing the right thing as far as the paper was concerned, and it was delighted. Also in today’s paper: - After two days of reports from an American author visiting the Royal Navy, it’s the turn of a Frenchman to sing their praises when he visits them – page 6 - More on the Tsar’s decision to take command of his army personally on page 7 - And more on the latest Zeppelin raids on page 7 as well - The man found with the incriminating letter over the Austro-Hungarian plot to foment strikes in America claims he was only the messenger and had no idea of its contents – page 7 . On page 8 Canadian papers report on a plot to attack the country’s wheat harvest - “Famous poet” Gabriele d’Annunzio, better known to posterity as a future founder of the Fascist Party, starts a series of articles on his impressions of war with the Italian army on page 8 - More on the sinking of the Hesperian on page 9 , as the number missing has now risen to 32 telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T04:37:09.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
