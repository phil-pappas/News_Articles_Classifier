Every time I look out of the window, there is a little knot of people peering through the black iron gates. This morning spectators parted like the Red Sea as we drove in. This evening a woman was standing outside with her spaniel, gazing. Not at me, you understand: at the house. Belmont, a dusky pink, foursquare Georgian summer retreat with an extraordinary history of ownership, is set high above the pretty little town of Lyme Regis on the Dorset coast. Just for this weekend, after two years of restoration and another six in the planning, its new owner the Landmark Trust opens it to the public. After that, you can stay in it, but not until 2017: next year is already full. The reason for all the fuss is threefold. Firstly, the last private owner was John Fowles, who finished The French Lieutenant’s Woman here, in a writing room overlooking Lyme’s famous harbour-within-a-harbour, the Cobb. It was Meryl Streep standing on the Cobb in a black hood and improbably bad weather conditions that became the defining image of the 1980s film of the book. It put Lyme Regis, hitherto tucked away, firmly on the map. A century before Fowles there was Richard Bangay, a Victorian socialist and popular local GP, who was a passionate astronomer and built himself a three-storey observatory in the garden. It’s still there: restored, repainted, with a snug at the top and, above that, the iron wheels and tracks he used to swing the dome and telescope across the skies. • The best Landmark Trust accommodation Before Dr Bangay there was Eleanor Coade, a single woman and 18th-century entrepreneur who ran a factory in Lambeth, South London, making a type of artificial stone so successful that she worked with some of the greatest architects and designers of the time. Her moulded urns, friezes, gods and goddesses, coats of arms and heraldic beasts were pale and elegant, fitting the classical aspirations of the Georgian age, and they lasted longer than stone. They enliven stately homes and concert halls, theatres and libraries, private houses and estates across Britain, as well as abroad. She was a native of nearby Devon and her uncle gave her the deeds to Belmont in the 1790s. She used it as a holiday house and, ever canny, decorated it inside and out with examples of her work. • The best hotels in Dorset Belmont was restored to its Regency appearance (John Miller) The Trust decided to restore the house to its Regency appearance, removing any later additions – this hasn’t been popular with Sarah, John Fowles’s widow, according to press reports – and repairing two centuries of depredations to the building’s fabric. Behind a symmetrical façade are two floors, each with four corner rooms of different sizes, and the house is generously proportioned with very high ceilings and tall sash windows. • Literary lodgings: former UK homes of great writers and poets That’s why everything looks weirdly familiar. For a Londoner, the crowned Neptune above the front door resembles a reclining Father Thames outside Ham House near Richmond; the rusticated stones around the window and door embrasures, holey as sea sponges, can be seen in Bedford Square; six urns marching along the roofline remind you of Kew or Chiswick House. But wherever you’re from, Liverpool, Norfolk, Cornwall, East Lothian, it rings bells. Her stuff is everywhere, sometimes with “Coade” and a date on it. It’s easily the poshest Landmark I’ve stayed in, with hotel-quality beds and bathrooms but all the warmth of period furniture, rugs on the wooden floors, delicate gilded mirrors and a jolly cast of portraits. It’s easily the poshest Landmark I’ve stayed in, with hotel-quality beds and bathrooms but all the warmth of period furniture, rugs on the wooden floors, delicate gilded mirrors and a jolly cast of portraits – including many of successful, confident women. Fowles’s first-floor writing room and the room below, now a huge, light kitchen with a modern range, conceal the bones of an earlier structure, a two-storey pavilion known as Bunter’s Castle. Belmont was restored over a period of two years (John Miller) The garden, now raw after all the construction, will be allowed to ramble and welcome wildlife, something that mattered to Fowles. It plunges downhill to the Cobb, though now houses block the way. Instead descend through the public gardens – past witty ammonite lampposts that remind you this is, after all, part of the Jurassic Coast and Unesco World Heritage Site – stopping above the beach to watch heads bob in the water and dinghies slipping back into the protective arm of the harbour for lunch, even in late September. There is a beautiful blank book in the upstairs drawing room, bound in green cloth. It says on the front, in gold letters “The Log of Belmont. Book I.” Inside, expensive, creamy pages stretch ahead, waiting for guests to write down all the things they have discovered. Maybe they will mention the Fisherman’s Wife chippy, where a fisherman in oilskins sat shucking scallops straight off the boat as curious visitors stuck their heads in to ask questions; or Lyme’s alleys and deep-set front doors, often half open, with threads of conversation floating out; or the mill race 6ft above the River Lym, separated by an unfenced causeway (“Do people ever fall in? After the pub?” “Oh yes. Oh yes. They do.”) Lyme Regis is a classic seaside resort town in Dorset (John Miller) Maybe they’ll find The Sanctuary, a bookshop crammed with printed matter – including original posters for The French Lieutenant’s Woman – where I stopped to buy a Fowles novel and asked the owner if he’d ever met him. He was quietly spoken, with a Panama pulled low on his forehead, but he smiled and said, “Oh yes, he used to sit there,” nodding at a set of library steps. “He was a regular, he encouraged me to start this place. I suppose he was just beginning, you know, to decline by then,” he dipped a hand. “He died in 2005.” • UK summer holiday planner Or maybe they’ll do what I did and be so beguiled by the Philpot Museum, built by a town mayor in 1901, curated by John Fowles for 10 years and stuffed with exhibits such as the Duke of Monmouth’s bed head and the finds and drawings of Lyme’s famous fossil hunter, Mary Anning, that they put their bag on a pillar to take a photo only to realise with horror it’s an original Belmont gatepost. Coade stone, of course, and sporting the family’s coot cypher (Coade was pronounced “Coode”), it was donated by Fowles himself. The last private owner was John Fowles, who finished The French Lieutenant’s Woman here, in a writing room overlooking Lyme’s famous harbour-within-a-harbour, the Cobb. Back at Belmont I looked at that big blank book and thought of Fowles looking out to sea and writing his odd, powerful novels, and Dr Bangay scribbling prescriptions and stellar notes, and Eleanor Coade writing to her fleet of sculptors and Royal Academicians, and I found I couldn’t write a thing. So I left it blank. Over to you, first set of guests, next in the long and illustrious line of Belmont residents. No pressure, then. Essentials Belmont is fully booked for 2016. To book for 2017, contact the Landmark Trust (01628 825925; landmarktrust.org.uk ); the house sleeps eight and costs from £640 for four nights.
