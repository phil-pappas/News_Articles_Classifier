There will be fall planting and plowing with horses, preserving produce and meat for the winter, the last historic baseball game of the season, an Oktoberfest celebration and so much more.\nIn keeping with the harvest theme, Old World Wisconsin is partnering with local food pantries in Eagle and Mukwonago to offer discounted admission for each guest that contributes a non-perishable food item. Adults and seniors will receive $2 off the regular admission fee and a $1 discount will be applied to each child ticket.\nOn Sunday, October 11 come and taste the autumn bounty at Old World Wisconsin’s 1894 Clausing Barn and enjoy a 19th century inspired harvest celebration. This dinner includes produce straight from the farms at Old World Wisconsin and the evening includes song, dance and music from the time period.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T14:22:41.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
