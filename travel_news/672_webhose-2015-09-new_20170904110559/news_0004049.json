With the philosophy ‘Life is a Journey’, the brand evolution goes hand in hand with Anantara’s global growth strategy.\nAnantara celebrates the journey of life and puts the sense of anticipation and excitement back into the world of luxury travel and hospitality. Since the first property opened its doors in the Thai seaside town of Hua Hin in 2001, Anantara has grown into a collection of 34 luxury hotels and resorts in city, island and desert settings, across ten countries. From Asia and the Indian Ocean to the Middle East and Africa, Anantara has evolved into an award-winning brand that offers outstanding guest experiences in istinctive and iconic settings.\nIn an insightful understanding of market trends and traveller expectations, the development of the Anantara brand marks the start of a dynamic new journey, both in terms of a strategic international footprint and enhancements to the guest experience.\n‘Life is a Journey’ reflects a contemporary interpretation of Anantara’s unique philosophy and core values of natural luxury, in parallel with the brand’s expansion plans. Setting an exciting stage for savvy travellers, the evolution embodies authentic luxury with a guest-centric focus. The evolution also incorporates a fresh new look and feel and a strong social and digital focus that encompasses a new website and mobile strategy giving travellers added value, reinforcing the brand’s premium positioning within the luxury segment, whilst creating a platform for future growth.\n“Anantara was born in response to discerning travellers seeking luxury with a sense of indigenous discovery. By infusing authentic cultural experiences and interactive journeys guided by gurus, Anantara satisfies guest desires to connect deeply and personally with their travel destinations,” explains Anantara founder and CEO and Chairman of Minor International, William E. Heinecke. “Fifteen years later, the way in which people travel and experience the world has changed, and Anantara’s brand refresh has taken shape to meet the expectations, inspire the passions and delight the tastes of new explorers in city and resort destinations.”\nTo reflect the brand evolution Anantara has created a new logo, keeping the iconic water jar which symbolises Thai hospitality and generous spirit, and two Thai cushions representing ultimate comfort.\nThe newly refined golden colour palette conveys Anantara’s elegance, luxury and shining modern energy.\nTo complement the refresh an innovative new brand website has been launched, featuring built in class-leading CMS technology and other advanced features such as personalisation that will increase visitor interaction with the site. Anantara is also taking mobile technology to the next level delivering consistent experiences across all devices and enabling potential customers to enjoy a streamlined browsing experience across multiple languages on any screen size using responsive technology. A new Anantara blog will also be launched giving international expertise and insider knowledge on the indigenous elements.\n“Advancing from Anantara’s many successes to date, the brand refresh is a significant milestone paving the way for an exciting new era,” said CEO Minor Hotel Group, Dillip Rajakarier. “In an insightful understanding of market trends and traveller expectations, the development of the Anantara brand marks the start of the dynamic new journey, both in terms of strategic international footprint and enhancements to the guest experience.”\nBringing travellers closer to the details of destinations and the local fabric, be it the escape of a pristine white-sand beach or the heart of bustling city neighbourhood. Anantara creates journeys of inspiring, surprising moments and enjoyment – elevating all senses and connecting with the environment and culture of each one of its locations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T18:10:38.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
