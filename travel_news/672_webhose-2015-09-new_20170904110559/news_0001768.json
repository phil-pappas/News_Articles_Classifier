In a meeting held recently, leaders from both organizations agreed on the benefits of expanding the global reach of the CEM Learning Program to India.\n“IAEE is pleased to collaborate with IEIA to bring the globally recognized CEM program to this region,” said IAEE President and CEO David DuBois, CMP, CAE, FASAE, CTA. “We are in the process of launching an exciting new partnership that will bridge the gap between the exhibition industries in both countries.”\n“I am happy to state that the reciprocity agreement we signed with IAEE is already bearing fruit,” said IEIA President Rakesh Kumar. “I thank Mr. David DuBois and his team at IAEE for helping us roll out the first edition of the CEM Program in India this year. I invite industry colleagues to make the best use of this opportunity and enroll themselves.”\nThe Certified in Exhibition Management (CEM) designation was created in 1975 to provide a professional designation for individuals in the exhibition industry. The designation was formed to raise professional standards and is recognized throughout the industry as the premier mark of professional achievement. The CEM Learning Program is currently offered in the United States, Brazil, Canada, China, Dubai, Korea, Mexico, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Taiwan and Thailand. More than 2,300 active CEMs around the world make up the CEM Network which serves as a new channel for communication, ideas, thought leadership, industry recognition and promotion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:34:32.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
