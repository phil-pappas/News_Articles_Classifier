Had I waited until next spring, I could have taken the recently announced WestJet non-stop, eight-hour flight from Winnipeg to London instead. But my type of connecting flight is the reality of today's travel that frustrates many, and the reason non-stop flights are so much preferred over those with stopovers of any kind.\nFRANCOIS MORI / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\nLong distance travel, with stops or not, is one of the factors in creating what is commonly known as jet lag. While the actual flying time on this trip was under 12 hours, the discomfort of sitting in one place for that length of time on trips like this can still take an additional toll on the body from aching muscles and sore legs.\nNotwithstanding other benefits of non-stop flights, when there are short layovers there is a recovery process that begins to take place with the additional movement and relaxation options available from being in a different environment. This is usually not easy on non-stop, distance flights, unless you have the budget to fly in the forward cabins.\nIn February of 2016, Emirates Airlines will begin a new routing that will become the aviation world's longest non-stop flight. From the United Arab Emirates to Panama City, passengers will be breathing aircraft recycled air for more than 17 hours. Flights such as this, when measured from door to door, especially if there are connections that are usually required when itineraries do not commence from a major hub, can easily last 30 to 36 hours. So the question I have often been asked by those who will soon be facing long trips is, \"Is there anything we can do to help alleviate the impact of flying to and from these destinations that are so far away from where we live?\"\nThere are a number of ways to reduce the effects of jet lag. Our body is governed by a biological process called the circadian rhythm, whose cycle lasts approximately 24 hours. It is influenced by a number of things but trained in no small part by light and darkness and our daily life patterns. Through an internal adjustment known as entrainment, it is why only after a few days, we feel entirely normal when we go to the other ends of the earth in our travels.\nSome suggest this process can start at home, by slowly changing your sleeping and eating patterns to become closer to those of the destination to which you will be travelling.\nOn long-duration flights, even though you may be in the middle of a five-person row, get up and walk around as often as possible. While seated, make a point of doing leg and arm exercises that increase circulation to your extremities.\nIn an article posted by the editors of the Fodor's travel books last year, they suggested a number of other actions travellers should consider to reduce the impact of jet lag, and assist in a faster recovery process ( www.fodors.com/news/10-tips-to-avoid-jet-lag-4457 ). They underscore that coffee and alcohol are not the best of beverages to consume on long flights. Instead stay hydrated with copious amounts of water, since the air and altitude on long flights have the dehydrating effects.\nOn long flights it is common for us to consume more alcohol than normal, have our sleep patterns disrupted completely, and eat foods that fall far outside our normal diets. Avoid the temptation of moving away from your standard food and beverage patterns.\nFodor's suggests you chose overnight flights if possible and try to sleep on your flight, particularly if you are flying west to east.\nWhen you arrive at your destination spend as much time as you can in the early hours and days in the sunlight. This will help circadian rhythms adjust to your new time zone more quickly.\nFor some people, taking melatonin for two or three nights after you arrive at your destination may be of helpful in adjusting to a new sleeping pattern.\nFor many years, my wife and I have been enthusiastic about the results we experience from taking the over the counter product No-Jet-Lag. Available at most travel stores and online, it is a homeopathic remedy with five basic active ingredients; Arnica Montana (Leopard's Bane), Bellis Perennis (Daisy), Chamomilla (Wild Chamomile), Ipecacuanha (Ipecac) and Lycopodium (Clubmoss). Sold in 32 tablet packs, we took one, as directed, every two hours on the flight and chose to continue for at least one or two doses after we arrived.\nAs fatigued as we may be after flights, we try to follow the advice of experts who suggest that unless you arrive in the evening close to what would be bedtime in the country you now are in, don't take a nap after checking into your hotel property. It is something so many people do, but the nap turns into a longer duration sleep, which will work against your body coming to terms with its new night and day surroundings.\nIn addition to jet lag, deep vein thrombosis, or hospitality class syndrome as it is often referred to, can affect anyone, young or old. Wearing compression socks will also help keep proper circulation, and are worth the investment as a preventive measure.\n \nSend your travel question or comments to pradinukr@shaw.ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T18:39:31.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
