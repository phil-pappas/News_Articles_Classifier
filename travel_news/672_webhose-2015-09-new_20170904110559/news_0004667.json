You've trawled through all The Student Room forums you can, and introduced yourself in painfully embarassing fashion to whatever Facebook groups have started to appear. Luckily for you, our A-Z is here to break down what the start of university is going to be like. Freshers Week A-Z A - Alcohol This will be everywhere. Imagine Freshers Week as a Bayeux Tapestry of drunkenness, with the soldiers replaced by lurching 18-year-olds (not that we condone heavy drinking). B - Baked goods Your diet will probably consist of sliced bread, microwaved Ginsters pasties and supermarket own-brand packets of biscuits – and precious little else. C - Career prospects This is why you’re spending thousands and thousands of pounds on studying, right? If you’ve a specific career plan in mind, sign up to relevant societies and chat to the careers service. If not, don’t stress. You’ve only just arrived and three years is a long time. D - Discounts You will be offered many of these. Use them wisely, and don’t go mad. You wouldn’t spend a tenner on a pair of hot-pink tights – so they’re still not a bargain on offer at £8.50. E - Earning Be warned: student jobs always involve dressing up in a shameful uniform and bumping into the one person you really fancy while you’re wearing it. Bar work is not your only option F - First-year friends Your new housemates are so great! Legends! Danny ate 28 Weetabix last night! Sadly, come term three you’ll despise Danny and the fact that he thinks it’s “a right laugh” to pee in a bucket in his bedroom and empty it into the bath – by which point you’ll have agreed to live with him again next year. G - Going out The organised fun of Freshers Week will make for the best – or worst –nights of your life. If you like shot-and-a-bottle deals and hearing Fatman Scoop’s 2003 hit Be Faithful on loop, you’ll have a great time. If not, grit your teeth and go anyway – complaining about the rubbish clubs is the best way to bond. H - Hoodies Almost everyone you meet will have somehow acquired a garment that’s printed with your university’s logo. You will have absolutely no idea where they got them from. Clearly, you didn’t get the memo. I - Identity This is your chance to completely reinvent yourself, come out of your shell or try something you've always wanted to try. Of course if you're perfectly happy with how you are, then this is a perfect opportunity to find like-minded individuals. J - Joining in Whether you’re a media geek, an Ultimate Frisbee sort of person or a music buff, you will find your tribe. K - Kitchen As you will only really be eating shop-bought baked goods for most of the first term, this will be the place where you stash your multipacks of cereal, along with those litre bottles of cider – nothing more. A student kitchen will almost never be this clean Photo: Mode Images / Alamy L - Love Unbelievably, Freshers Week is where lots of people meet the special someone they’ll marry and grow old with. Their eyes meet across a crowded bar while Fatman Scoop is being blasted at them, and that’s it. This, remember, is true romance. Bless. M - Mature students There will be people (a lot) older than 18 in your lectures, and they will all be wearing fleeces. N - No money Everyone will be warning you not to, but you’ll probably end up spending it all during Freshers’ Week anyway. O - Overdraft Make sure you have an interest-free one, which you can get with a student bank account – you’ll almost certainly be seeing a lot more of the letters “DR” on your statements over the next few years. P - Parties The legendary house party is so much cooler than the standard club grind and considerably more fun than the pub. Cherish these glorious nights of unsupervised fun. Q - Quitting Everyone thinks about this at some point. Fact. It’s perfectly natural to crave your normal family, normal friends and normal life and toy with the idea of jacking it all in to go and work in Currys. R - Reading list Do get the things on it out of the library. Nobody wants to be the person who shows up to a seminar thinking the book’s called Nicholas Nicholson. Competition for library books can be problematic Photo: Alamy S - Sports socials These are the messiest nights out you will ever participate in. They will involve the football and netball teams dressing up as cavemen and doing unspeakable things to each other on nightclub sofas. T - Two One Don’t worry – pretty much everyone you know will get one of these in the end . U - Useful things Keep your printer, flip-flops for wearing in the disgusting shower and anything else remotely practical a secret, as everyone you live with will want to borrow them. V - Vitamins A parent or wellwisher may have packed some on your behalf in a desperate bid to ensure that you don’t end up with scurvy. Take them religiously. W - Weekends These don’t exist for you any more. One for the philosophy students: if you can legitimately get wasted on a Tuesday night, then what significance does a Saturday hold? X - Exes Choose your partners wisely, or you’ll spend a lot of your time on campus hiding from them when things come to an end in a dramatic fashion. Maybe that’s why everyone wears those identical hoodies – for camouflage. Y - Yes Say it, often. Grab every opportunity you can, whether it’s joining societies or just going for a coffee with a new group of people. Z - Zombie At the end of the week you’ll be a glassy-eyed husk of your former self. But you know what? It will have been completely worth it. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T09:54:28.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
