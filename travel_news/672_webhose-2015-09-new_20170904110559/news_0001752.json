I sat at the feet of the master, my paternal grandmother Claressa, who taught me how to find a good deal and revel in the thrill of the chase. As a regular traveler, there are things that one must carry, whether they are doing a weekend trip to Ocean City, Maryland, or flying to Singapore. As someone who prefers to spend her money on treasures at her destination, I’ve learned to bargain shop for my air travel necessities.\nI am a HUGE fan of Dollar Tree . For the uninitiated, this is a store that sells everything — and I mean everything — for a dollar or less. Items range from holiday decor/ornaments to baby supplies, to arts and crafts items, to books, to kitchen wares, to electronics, to food (although I tend to stay away from the food). So before you take your next trip, check out 10 things you can buy at Dollar Tree.\nColin Anderson/Blend Images/Getty Images 1. Sleep Mask/Socks Remember when they used to give these out on long-haul coach flights? Not anymore. But you can still feel like you’re sitting in first class when you buy both of these items at Dollar Tree!\nPhoto by Benet J. Wilson 2. TSA-approved travel bottles The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) can get very picky about the size of travelers' liquids. This package of three 3-oz bottles are handy for carrying everything from facial cleanser to hand lotion. You can get a set with a spray bottle or a pump bottle.\nPhoto by Benet J. Wilson 3. Batteries You can buy 8-packs of Sunbeam or Rayovac AA and AAA batteries. They aren’t alkaline, but they do last a pretty good amount of time. You can also get 4-packs of Panasonic alkaline batteries for that same dollar.\n4. Manicure Set You get a set of nail clippers and two emery boards in a small size that fit into your purse. You can also buy nail polish remover pads and cheap nail polish in case you need an emergency touch-up.\nPhoto by Benet J. Wilson 5. Water Bottle You can’t take water past security, but you can buy this bottle and fill it up once you’ve cleared the checkpoint. You can also ask a flight attendant (nicely) to fill it for you on long-haul flights.\n6. Lip Balm It gets dry in an aircraft, so you need to keep moisturized. You can get two lip balms in different flavors and SPF 15 at your friendly Dollar Tree. One to keep in the purse and one to keep in the toiletries bag!\n7. Baby Wipes These are a universal travel tool. They can refresh your face after a long flight. They can clean a tray table or other surfaces. You can clean your hands after eating the meal you brought aboard. And they fit nicely in a plastic sandwich bag.\nPhoto by Benet J. Wilson 8. Medical Items You can buy Ibuprofen, aspirin, cold medicine, cough drops, generic Neosporin, a first aid kit, band aids, antacids, melatonin strips (great for combating jetlag) and cold/hot pads in case your back or knee acts up.\n9. Wisp disposable toothbrushes You can get these four to a pack. They’re great to use to freshen up after a red-eye or long-haul flight, because who wants to smell your bad breath? Use one of your three-ounce bottles (see item #1) and fill it with mouthwash. More »\n10. Travel vacuum bags Use these to pack and compress your clothes so you can get more into your checked and carry-on bag. You can also buy an extra tote bag just in case your bag is too full.", "external_links": ["http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://airtravel.about.com/od/travelindustrynews/tp/10-Air-Travel-Necessities-You-Can-Buy-At-Dollar-Tree.htm?utm_source=pinterest&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=shareurlbuttons_nip&media=http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/k/L/Water-Bottle.jpg&description=Air", "http://www.panasonic-batteries.com/eu/products/primary_batteries", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/L/d/L/acp-307_1z.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/k/L/Water-Bottle.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/n/L/IMG_2149-224x300.jpg", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://airtravel.about.com/od/travelindustrynews/tp/10-Air-Travel-Necessities-You-Can-Buy-At-Dollar-Tree.htm?utm_source=pinterest&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=shareurlbuttons_nip&media=http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/d/L/acp-307_1z.jpg&description=Air", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/L/n/L/IMG_2149-224x300.jpg", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://airtravel.about.com/od/travelindustrynews/tp/10-Air-Travel-Necessities-You-Can-Buy-At-Dollar-Tree.htm?utm_source=pinterest&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=shareurlbuttons_nip&media=http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/m/L/IMG_2132-224x300.jpg&description=Air", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://airtravel.about.com/od/travelindustrynews/tp/10-Air-Travel-Necessities-You-Can-Buy-At-Dollar-Tree.htm?utm_source=pinterest&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=shareurlbuttons_nip&media=http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/w/L/158315400-crop.jpg&description=Air", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/L/l/L/IMG_2125-224x300.jpg", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://airtravel.about.com/od/travelindustrynews/tp/10-Air-Travel-Necessities-You-Can-Buy-At-Dollar-Tree.htm?utm_source=pinterest&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=shareurlbuttons_nip&media=http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/l/L/IMG_2125-224x300.jpg&description=Air", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/m/L/IMG_2132-224x300.jpg", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://airtravel.about.com/od/travelindustrynews/tp/10-Air-Travel-Necessities-You-Can-Buy-At-Dollar-Tree.htm?utm_source=pinterest&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=shareurlbuttons_nip&media=http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/n/L/IMG_2149-224x300.jpg&description=Air", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/d/L/acp-307_1z.jpg", "http://www.tsa.gov/", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/l/L/IMG_2125-224x300.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/L/m/L/IMG_2132-224x300.jpg", "http://www.dollartree.com/home.jsp", "http://www.colgatewisp.com/wisp/HomePage", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/L/w/L/158315400-crop.jpg", "http://www.rayovac.com/", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/w/L/158315400-crop.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/L/k/L/Water-Bottle.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T16:02:05.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
