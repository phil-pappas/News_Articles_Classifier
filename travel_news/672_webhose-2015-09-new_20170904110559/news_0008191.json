Our members are already showing their commitment by complying with the EU ETS **** scheme, as well as implementing their own fuel-saving initiatives.\n“ERA fully supports and endorses the protection of the environment, co-ordinating industry policy and promoting the aviation industry’s considerable achievements to reduce its impact. ERA also works very closely with ATAG and is proud to be part of this commitment by the aviation sector to drastically reduce CO2 emissions through meaningful market-based measures. However, government endorsement and support is vital.”\nMichael Gill, Executive Director of ATAG, adds: “The whole commercial air transport industry is united in its efforts to reduce emissions and increase fuel efficiency and renewable energy opportunities. Today’s letter solidifies that support with a personal commitment from industry chief executives that their businesses will continue to pursue our sector-wide goals of maximum CO2 emissions reduction. As an industry, we have already invested billions of dollars in efficiency measures and we now call on governments to help us further those efforts and support an even more sustainable future for flight.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T15:45:58.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
