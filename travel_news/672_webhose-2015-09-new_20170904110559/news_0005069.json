This is when the north and south poles of the Earth are not tilted towards or away from the sun, as at other times, but are aligned so as to give, theoretically, the same amount of daylight in both of the Earth's hemispheres. \nThe world equinox is derived from the Latin, meaning equal night. \nThere are two equinoxes - the spring equinox, around March 23 and the autumn equinox, around now. How to celebrate the autumn equinox \nJust as they gather for the spring equinox and the summer solstice, druids meet at Stonehenge to greet the equinox with song and music. In China, a mid-autumn festival relating to the harvest is celebrated, in Korea, Chuseok - a type of thanksgiving - is held. \nIn Southern California meanwhile, the Chumash, a Native American tribe, celebrates Hutash, a sun ceremony that coincides with the autumn equinox. \n\nBut the most popular way to see in autumn is by appreciating the changing colours of the trees. Depending which hemisphere you are in, this can occur at different times of year. Where to go leaf peeping \nBlue Ridge Parkway, USA \nSeveral hundred miles south of New England, head for the Blue Ridge Parkway, one of the country’s most scenic roads, running for some 470 miles through Virginia and North Carolina. From late September to the end of October, hickory, sassafras, poplar and maple trees put on a tremendous show. \nWestonbirt Arboretum, UK \nIf you want to catch autumn colour a bit closer to home, there’s nowhere better than the National Tree Collection at Westonbirt in Gloucestershire. According to the Forestry Commission, the first trees to start turning will be native species such as dogwood and common spindle in mid-September, followed by maples, rowans and ironwoods. \nJapan \nIn Japanese, “koyo” is the term for autumn leaves. From mid-September each year, the “koyo front” moves south from Hokkaido towards the south of the country, which it typically reaches around late November, though there should be foliage worth seeing in Tokyo and Kyoto even into December. \nSouth Island, New Zealand \nOf course autumn comes considerably later (or earlier, if you prefer) this far south, but it’s worth waiting till mid-April, peak season for the trees to sing out in spectacular yellow hues, especially next to the lakes and rivers around Tekapo, the Waitaki Valley and Central Otago. \nLake Bled , Slovenia \nKnown as one of the most beautiful lakes in the world (with tourist numbers to match), this small but perfectly formed body of water in the Julian Alps is surrounded by forested mountains, boasts a fairytale castle atop a crag and has an island with a 17th-century church. And when those leaves start to turn, it really does look magical. \nBavarian Alps, Germany \nAutumn in Bavaria isn’t only about beer and pretzels – it’s perfect hiking weather, and the best time of year for magnificent views of forests, lakes and mountains south of Munich, as the pine trees turn. Though if you really can't tear yourself away from the Oktoberfest, the Englischer Garten in Munich will give a pretty good display too. \nPatagonia , Argentina/Chile \nFrom the Chilean Lake District and Torres del Paine National Park, to Argentina’s southern Andes and the Perito Moreno Glacier, this is a truly spectacular and remote landscape with a huge variety of tree species which in April turn a glorious russet and gold.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T02:17:50.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
