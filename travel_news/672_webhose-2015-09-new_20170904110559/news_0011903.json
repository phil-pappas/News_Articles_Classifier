Online check-in opens 24 hours before and closes 4 hours prior to departure. \nFiji Airways' Acting CEO David Bowden commented, “We recognize our customers’ needs for seamless and convenient travel options and are undertaking various steps to enhance their experience. The online check-in service will offer customers the flexibility and comfort of checking-in from their home or office, saving them time and enabling them to avoid airport queues.” \nAfter completing online check-in, customers can print a boarding pass then only need to present themselves at the Express Bag Drop Counter to drop their checked-in luggage. The Bag Drop Counter will have service staff available to assist. \nCustomers checking-in online and traveling with cabin baggage will be able to have the weight and dimensions of their bag verified at the Express Bag Drop counter prior to clearing security and immigration. Groups traveling together can also check-in through this online feature. \nMeanwhile, in another service enhancement, Fiji Airways customers are now also able to purchase seats with extra legroom on selected international flights at the airport. This allows them to guarantee a coveted exit row or bulkhead seat. \nCustomers who have already checked-in online and would like to purchase an economy seat with extra legroom can do so at the Service Desk Counter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T18:48:53.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
