Fifty-six percent of all respondents said they plan airfare and hotels and some activities in advance of their trips, but like to have plenty of unscheduled time to enjoy as they please. Sixty-one percent of women are these “partial planners” as are 52 percent of men. Twenty percent of men and 15 percent of women said the only pre-panning they do is booking hotels and airfare in advance, leaving all activities unscheduled.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T00:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T03:36:16.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
