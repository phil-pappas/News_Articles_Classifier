When and where you rent can have a major impact on rates.\nWeekend rentals are typically cheaper than weekday rentals. Many companies offer deals for Thursday-Monday rentals, and some offer weekend rates Friday through Monday. Rentals of five, six or seven days will usually push you into a weekly rental, which can be cheaper than renting for a few days. If you need a car Monday through Thursday, check the Monday-Friday rate, because it may be cheaper.\nRates are subject to taxes and fees, such as replacement tire fees, replacement tag fees and on and on. Airport locations have more taxes and fees than neighborhood locations.\nWe looked at rentals at Washington Reagan National Airport from Thursday to Monday (Sept. 17 to 21), picking up at 2 p.m. and returning at 2 p.m. Prices for the rental started at $77 from Advantage, $85 from Dollar, $101 from Budget, and other companies averaged $228. Both Dollar and Budget advertised rates of $17 per day, but when you added on the taxes and fees, Budget was $16 more because it was at an on-airport location that has extra taxes and fees and Dollar was at an off-airport location. Both locations had airport shuttles, but you typically get a better overall price at off-airport locations.\nWe also looked at rentals from Friday to Sept. 21. The price for Advantage was the same as the four-day rental, $77, but Dollar and Budget prices were higher. Dollar, Alamo and Enterprise were charging $93, Budget was charging $113 and Hertz, Avis and National were charging $162.\nCheck flight times\nPay attention to flight times, or you could pay a lot more for your car rental. If you pick up your car at 2 p.m., you could probably return home with a 4 p.m. flight and not have to pay extra because you’ll need to drop the car by 2 or 2:30 to make your flight. If you return on an 8 p.m. flight, you could pay for a whole extra rental day. When renting for four days or less, we often see an extra charge for each hour you go over your pick-up time, up to three hours. After three hours, your rate will likely be the same as if you rented for an extra day. When you rent for five to seven days, you will usually get a weekly rate and you may not have to worry about return time.\nDon’t assume the smallest car will be your cheapest option. When we checked weekly rentals at Washington Reagan National, intermediate cars were cheaper than compact and economy cars.\nGas: When to prepay?\nWhenever you rent, you’ll be asked if you want to prepay for gas. Sometimes this makes sense, but if you won’t use a full tank, you won’t get any money back and you’ll be overpaying. The worst thing to do is to not prepay and return the car on empty, because you could end up paying notoriously high rates for gas, up to $9 per gallon.\nGas stations close to the airport are often more expensive than other stations, but they are still much cheaper than what the rental company will charge you if you don’t prepay.\nMost companies start you out with a full tank, but Enterprise starts you at whatever the last renter left in the tank. My recent rental had a quarter of a tank, so I had to return it with a quarter tank. I chose to prepay at the rate of $1.70 per gallon for that quarter tank, which was cheaper than the $1.99 per gallon at nearby gas stations. Because I prepaid, I planned to return it empty.\nAvoid using a debit card. Many companies will put a hold on your account for $200, plus estimated rental costs. Some locations may not accept debit cards, so be sure to ask.\nWhen comparing prices, make sure you are looking at the total price because taxes and fees can really vary. I like looking at websites that show a number of car rental company rates so I can compare the total prices from different agencies.\nBefore you book that next airline ticket, you may want to play around with car rental dates to get the best price. With fares to many destinations less than $100 from Dallas lately, the difference you can save could be almost equal to the price of your airline ticket. It pays to shop around and test different rental times and dates.\nTom Parsons is the editor of bestfares.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-13T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T10:56:07.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
