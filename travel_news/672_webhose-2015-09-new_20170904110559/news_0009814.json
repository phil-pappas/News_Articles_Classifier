The new service will be operated by Air China’s new-generation three-cabin B777-300ER and will arrive at and depart from Terminal B3 at Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR). It will complement the double daily service to Beijing Capital International Airport (BCIA) from JFK International in New York. \n“The new Beijing-Newark service is our response to the growing demand from the New York metropolitan area to China and beyond. Transpacific travelers from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut will benefit greatly from this increase in connectivity,” Mr. Yuelong Zhou, Air China’s General Manager stated. \n“With our robust network and convenient connections to cities in China and Asia from our Beijing hub, our passengers will appreciate the options and flexibility our new Newark-Beijing service offers,” Mr. Zhou added. \nFeaturing state of the art green technology, the B777-300ER delivers better fuel performance and is much quieter than any other aircraft. With a spacious three cabin interior, ambient lighting and an enhanced entertainment system, the triple seven offers a smooth, comfortable experience. It features eight luxury suites in the Forbidden Pavilion (first class), 41 fully-flat sleeper seats in the Capital Pavilion (business class) and 259 economy seats with individual TV monitors and in-seat audio-video on demand.
