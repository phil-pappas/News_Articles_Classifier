It’s also usually the final meal a guest enjoys with us before leaving us, so it’s vital it creates a really positive and memorable impression, both of our individual hotels and of our brilliant Radisson Blu brand,” says Philip Mahoney, Vice President Food & Drinks at the Rezidor Hotel Group.\nSuper Breakfast is an industry-leading breakfast offer that has played a major role in Radisson Blu’s brand proposition for many years and the Super part of the title has become a benchmark for many of our competitors. “We know that our guests’ tastes and preferences continuously change and evolve. So we’ve now re-analyzed what the sophisticated modern traveler really wants and expects, then re-evaluated what we at Radisson Blu actually deliver, to ensure that, moving forwards, we’re 100% satisfying our guest’s desires and expectations,” adds Mahoney.\nThe result is a creative new offering that showcases some careful thought as a deviation from the norm. It’s designed to be comfortable and to tell a story but it may also take guests on a bit of a journey – one of enlightenment, unexpected, anticipation, honest and a natural food experience. Super breakfast is about perception and how this is shaped by a mix of senses, not just by taste. The brand held trials with guests of the Radisson Blu Strand and Radisson Blu Royal Viking hotels in Stockholm and at the Radisson Blu EU Hotel in Brussels. The research produced encouragingly positive guest satisfaction scores and provided the following insights on what guests expected from a great breakfast:\nA real sense of place – food that represents the locality and season Unbeatable quality – including great coffee and really fresh orange juice Health considerations – delicious low fat, low sugar and food intolerance choices are all easy to find Beautiful presentation to stir all the senses – with gorgeous tableware, linens and subtle scents The service – If we’ve got it, it’s yours! Radisson Blu’s famous Yes I Can! philosophy just makes the whole “start your day in a great way” that extra special.\nThroughout the month of September – celebrated as the brand’s Responsible Business Action Month – Radisson Blu will encourage its guests to taste the new Super Breakfast and also help vulnerable children by taking part in “Buy a Breakfast, Give a Breakfast”. Funds raised by the initiative will go to the World Childhood Foundation and will be shared between three of its important projects: Advance, The Way Home in Ukraine and SixtyOneThree, based in South Africa.\nRadisson Blu estimates that 50 guests in each of their 70 participating hotels can potentially provide 3,500 breakfasts for children who don’t have access to a proper breakfast or meal. Volunteers from Radisson Blu hotels will also be active in their local communities serving Super Breakfast to children, and engage in several fundraising and community service activities throughout the month.\nJoanna Rubinstein President & CEO, World Childhood Foundation USA says: “Our aim is to protect and support children across the globe. But for many, hunger is part of their everyday lives. So we’re hugely thankful to Radisson Blu for their Buy a Breakfast, Give a Breakfast project – and for their continued support of the foundation as a whole.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T11:10:31.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
