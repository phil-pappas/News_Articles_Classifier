Inspired by traditional Balinese design and reflecting the fabled natural wonder of the region, the upcoming Mövenpick Resort & Spa Jimbaran is an idyllic haven of 295 rooms, including six suites, amid meandering pools and lush landscaped gardens. With breath-taking sunset views from the rooftop lounge and hotel restaurant, the resort also features a 500-sqm ballroom, custom-designed kids’ club, business centre and meeting rooms, gym, library and spa, along with the Samasta Mall, which consists of a wide collection of boutiques, restaurants, gourmet market and a Mövenpick ice cream parlour. Mövenpick Resort & Spa Jimbaran is amongst eight hotels and resorts the group is opening over the next three years in the region, with expansion also in Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. Thailand is also a major focus, with the recent opening of Mövenpick Hotel Sukhumvit 15 Bangkok, followed in the first quarter of next year by the 264-room Mövenpick Siam Hotel Pattaya positioned for families and business meetings on Jomtien Beach. They add to an existing portfolio of three Mövenpick hotels in Phuket and Koh Samui, for a total of five hotels in Thailand by 2017. Further hotels to open across the region are Mövenpick Hotel & Convention Centre Kuala Lumpur and Mövenpick Resort & Spa Kuala Terrengganu in Malaysia; Mövenpick Resort Boracay in the Philippines; Mövenpick Hotel & State Guest House Chifeng, China; and Mövenpick Resort & Spa Quy Nhon, Vietnam. The existing eight-property portfolio of Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts in Asia includes four in Thailand and one each in Singapore, Vietnam, China and the Philippines.
