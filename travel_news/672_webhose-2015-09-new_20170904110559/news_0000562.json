However, there is also a possibility the currency would continue weakening.\n\"With global equity markets and commodities continuing on the path to destruction the rand will continue to be sold off,\" Standard Bank trader Warrick Butler said.\nThe rand has dropped about 15% to the dollar since the start of June and was on pace for its worst quarterly performance since 2011, according to Iress data.\nInvestec economist Annabel Bishop has partly blamed the South African Reserve Bank for the renewed weakness in the rand, saying it softened after hawkish comments at the September monetary policy committee meeting. The Bank signalled further interest rate increases.\nSince the monetary policy committee statement on September 23, foreigners had sold R2bn worth of SA equities, Ms Bishop said.\nMeanwhile, though some of the rout in global markets eased from Monday, equity markets touched a two-year low on Tuesday as the outlook for raw materials prices and emerging markets remained soft.\nPlatinum fell to $894, its lowest since December 2008, on fears that the emissions scandal embroiling German vehicle manufacturer Volkswagen could hit demand from the automotive sector.\nMining and trading company Glencore, whose shares fell by almost a third on Monday on investor concern over its debt levels, bounced up 16.7% in London but only after its Hong Kong-listed shares fell 29%.\nEarlier, Asian shares slid to three-and-a-half-year lows on China slowdown concerns.\nCopper steadied after hitting a one-month low. It last traded at $4,977.50 a tonne, up 0.3% on the day but within reach of a six-and-a-half-year low below $4,855.\nWith Reuters, Bloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:35:23.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
