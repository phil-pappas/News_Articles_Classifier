In short, my job is to sell ‘the dream’, whatever that might be in the eyes of each person.” Clive Williams, the catering manager at University of Leicester has been shortlisted in the F&B category. When asked about the highlight of his career he said, “I was the manager responsible for arranging a lunch for the Queen when she opened the Universities new Library in 2008. I was responsible for creating a menu and overseeing the service for 120 VIP guests in one of our Halls of Residence.” Shortlisted in the Sales and Marketing category, Julia Simpson the key account manager at Lime Venue Portfolio was asked why she thinks she has been nominated for a miaList award, “My enthusiasm and hardworking nature has brought me respect among colleagues and clients alike. I am a team player yet self-motivated. I always put colleagues achievements before my own, being nominated is giving recognition directly to me!” The miaList 2015 awards ceremony is shaping up to be an unmissable event. The full interviews of all the shortlisted candidates will be available to read in the conference brochure.
