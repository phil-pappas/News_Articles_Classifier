The selection of Trimble Driver Safety complements Liberty Tire's implementation of Trimble Fleet Management, providing Liberty Tire complete visibility into their day-to-day field service operations.\nLiberty Tire is an American conservation company that collects and recycles about 140 million tires annually. Liberty Tire drivers log more than 16 million miles each year. By adding Trimble Driver Safety to its fleet management capabilities, Liberty Tire will have full visibility into high-risk driving behaviors such as jackrabbit starts, hard braking, harsh turns and speeding. Monitoring these behaviors allows managers to coach specific at-risk drivers on improving their driving technique.\nThe Trimble Driver Safety solution provides real-time performance alerts to drivers. In-cab feedback prompts drivers to make immediate adjustments to their driving behavior. This solution has proven to be a key component for fleet operations managers looking to reduce accidents and liability while lowering operational costs.\n\"As one of the leading tire recyclers in North America , road safety is an integral part of our operation,\" said Tony Guiffre , compliance director for Liberty Tire. \"We understand the consequences of poor driving, and we chose the Trimble Driver Safety solution because it identifies and monitors unhealthy driving practices so we can reduce risks on the road. Making sure our drivers adhere to the best driving procedures is vital to protecting them and our business.\"\n\"Creating a safer driving environment has been a major emphasis at Liberty Tire, and Driver Safety will support them in reaching this goal,\" said John Cameron , general manager of Trimble's Field Service Management Division. \"Using this solution, Liberty Tire can monitor their drivers' performance and minimize accidents. Trimble Driver Safety also will enable Liberty Tire to deliver on its safety campaign for zero incidents while increasing efficiencies through reduced fuel consumption.\"\nLiberty Tire already is benefitting from its implementation of Trimble Fleet Management, which gives the company much-needed real-time visibility into day-to-day operations, including driver locations, travel times and overall fleet performance. By incorporating Trimble Driver Safety, Liberty Tire will further refine its fleet operations with safety and performance improvements.\nTrimble Fleet Management and Trimble Driver Safety are core components of Trimble's integrated suite of Field Service Management solutions that includes FieldMaster and Work Management. Trimble FieldMaster mobile applications drive enhanced visibility and information sharing between the field and the back office to enable a streamlined field service operation. Trimble Work Management is a cloud-based solution that transforms the productivity of a mobile workforce through intelligent scheduling tools and state-of-the-art performance analytics.\nFor more information about these and other Trimble Field Service Management solutions, call 1-877-728-7623 or email: fsminfo@trimble.com .\nAbout Liberty Tire Recycling\nLiberty Tire Recycling is the premier provider of tire recycling services in the U.S. By reclaiming more than 140 million of the nation's discarded tires, Liberty Tire annually transforms such waste into smart, sustainable products that improve people's lives.
