In this remote, unspoilt area of Wyoming, the neighbouring National Parks of Yellowstone and Grand Teton offer spectacular mountain scenery and unmatched wildlife viewing opportunities. The ski area, Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, sits in the Bridger Teton National Forest, so there are numerous wide tree-lined runs to enjoy, and, although famous for its steep expert terrain, the slopes here have plenty to keep beginners and intermediates happy, too. A short bus ride from the resort, historic Jackson Town has a genuine old Wild West feel with its wooden sidewalks and saloon bars. Prize winners will be staying at Snow King Resort near the atmospheric Town Square, which offers luxury hotel and self-catering accommodation. Newly renovated, it is decorated in a Western style and has a spa with outdoor heated pool and hot tub, delicious local food and an on-site ski and snowboard rental shop. Plus, there’s a free shuttle to Jackson Hole Mountain Resort for you to explore the famous terrain. Jackson Hole is offering the chance to win a holiday for two. The prize includes six nights’ room-only at the Snow King hotel, five-day lift passes, return flights from London Heathrow to Jackson on United Airlines and transfers. The closing date for entries is midnight on November 3 2015. Terms and conditions apply.
