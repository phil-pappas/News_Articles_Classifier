The tickets are available through Vet Tix , a national nonprofit organization.\nAmerica Haunts is an association of more than 30 elite haunted attractions throughout the United States . Individual America Haunts members have participated with Vet Tix in previous years, but this is the first year the entire association is participating.\n\"Our servicemen and women sign on to serve their country, often sacrificing the opportunity to take part in beloved holiday traditions like celebrating Halloween with their families. We are honored to have the opportunity to thank them in some small way,\" said Amber Arnett-Bequeaith , vice president of America Haunts.\nCEO Mike Focareto , a Navy veteran, launched Vet Tix in 2008. The idea for Vet Tix was born when Focareto was at the Super Bowl XLII game in Glendale, Arizona.\n\"He learned that the members of the Honor Guard were not actually invited to the game,\" said Vet Tix Chief Community Officer Brandi Shannon . \"At the same time, he sat next to an empty seat. He thought, 'Wouldn't it be nice if one of our veterans could be sitting here enjoying the game?'\"\nIn the past 12 months, Vet Tix has given away approximately 500,000 tickets to events around the country. The organization works with venues to distribute unused tickets to over 275,000 military members and veterans who would like to use them. Events include those at very small venues all the way up to professional sporting events and top-selling concerts. They also help veterans and their families attend events they otherwise could not with the \"Hero's Wish\" program, where veterans and active duty personnel and their families can post requests for events and donors can provide tickets or money toward the purchase of tickets to events.\nTo receive the tickets, veterans and members of the military and their families can visit www.vettix.org to create a free account and request tickets.\nAbout America Haunts\nWith more than 30 haunted houses and attractions across the country, America Haunts delivers fear-based entertainment to more than a million thrill seekers each season.

Vet Tix provides free event tickets to currently serving military, veterans and family members of KIA to sporting events, concerts, performing arts and family activities. Our military and veterans experience many difficult transitions as they reintegrate back into their families, their communities and eventually civilian life. Attending these events improves morale, strengthens family bonds through shared interests and encourages service members to stay engaged with local communities and American life. In gratitude for their service and to support their reintegration processes, Vet Tix is dedicated to giving back to those who gave us so much.
