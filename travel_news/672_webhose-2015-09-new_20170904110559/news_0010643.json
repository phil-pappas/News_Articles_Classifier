Nieh, a spokesman for EVA Air, which was not the airline in question, said in an email: \"If a passenger reports that another passenger is smoking, an EVA flight attendant will check to verify. If the flight attendant catches the smoker in the act, the flight attendant will explain the no-smoking rule to that passenger. The flight attendant will also make an announcement to remind all passengers of the no-smoking rule, inform the captain of the incident and record the incident.\" \nBut Alaska (also not the airline in question) said its flight attendants do not \"need to personally see any activity to make the request for the person to stop.\" \nThe prevailing philosophy, said R.C. Stevens, a flight attendant for a regional airline, is informing, not enforcing. \n\"If we don't see it ourselves, there's not really a whole lot that we are able to do about it, unfortunately,\" said Stevens, author of \"Thirty Synchronized Woodpeckers,\" which explores the world of aviation from a flight attendant's point of view. In a previous career as a security director, she frequently ran into the same issue, she said in an email. \nIf you're thinking an e-cigarette is a good way to address nicotine cravings in flight, you might want to reconsider. Dr. Joseph Austin Jr., a pulmonologist on the medical staff at Texas Health Arlington Memorial Hospital, would suggest a nicotine patch or gum because the Food and Drug Administration has approved them; e-cigarettes have not been OK'd as a smoking cessation tool. \nSIGN UP for the free Opinion newsletter >> \nAs a pulmonologist, he is understandably not a fan of e-cigarettes, which, he notes, deliver as much nicotine as a cigarette, produce a byproduct that may be harmful to innocent bystanders and contain propylene glycol, which can be fatal if ingested (although, he notes, it's not easy to get to). \nSome users say that the e-cig is safer than regular cigarettes. We probably won't know for several years, he said, because this is a relatively new product. \nBut apparently the process of declaring that something is a problem can be a lengthy one. Tobacco was introduced to Europe in the 1500s; it wasn't until January 1964 that \"Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General\" dropped the bombshell that smoking would adversely affect health. \nI'm not sure the world would be worse off if every cigarette or cigarette-like device went up in smoke. But until that happens, keep your e-cigs in your carry-on bag, wear the patch or chew the gum, and think about how much more money for travel you'll have if you quit. \nHave a travel dilemma?
