Now, in addition to sharing their valuable reviews, they have a chance to highlight the best travel find or gem they discovered through the site, whether it’s a rustic little restaurant, a great hotel deal or an invaluable tip from the Forums,” said Barbara Messing, chief marketing officer for TripAdvisor.\n“And for one lucky winner, their discovery will win them the trip of a lifetime for two people to a recent Travelers’ Choice Destination city. We’re excited to see what great travel discoveries our engaged community will share.”\nEntries must be submitted in a video format on the TripAdvisor Facebook page before the September 29 deadline. Once all the entries have been received, the videos will be hosted on the competition page where friends, family and the wider travel community will be able to watch and vote for their favorite discoveries.
