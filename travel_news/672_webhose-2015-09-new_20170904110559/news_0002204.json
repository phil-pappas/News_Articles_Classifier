Two-thirds of international visitors arrive in the United States through the VWP, and every time a new country is added, we see visitation by its citizens skyrocket. Moreover, we do not achieve this by simply waving people across our borders: the VWP is overwhelmingly praised by experts as an enormous boon to national security, as well.\n“This legislation would further sharpen America’s security and competitiveness in the booming global market for business and leisure travel. Its provisions will send a powerful worldwide message that the United States is serious about security, but welcomes legitimate international visitors whose spending benefits destinations across the United States.\n“We thank and congratulate the Senate cosponsors of the JOLT Act for working to enhance both national and economic security, and we look forward to working together to enact the JOLT Act this session.”\n \n \nSource:- U.S Travel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T18:48:11.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
