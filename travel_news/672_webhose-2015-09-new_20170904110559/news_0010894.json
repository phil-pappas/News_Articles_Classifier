VIA Rail transported 912,900 passengers, a slight increase of 0.1%, compared to 2014.\n“Our revenues increased compared to last year, showing that our efforts are yielding results. Despite our success in this area, On Time Performance (OTP) continues to deteriorate due to increased freight traffic on third-party owned railways. We continue to look for creative ways to improve services within these limitations, in cooperation with our infrastructure partners”, said VIA Rail’s President and CEO Yves Desjardins-Siciliano. “In order to address the challenges associated with sharing the railway with freight trains, we have been working on a plan for dedicated passenger rail for the busiest Toronto-Ottawa-Montreal routes. It would allow for a greater number of frequencies, shorter trip times and ultimately a safer and more reliable service.”\n“This quarter, we also focused on reaching out to many different communities, listening to the needs of these various groups, and taking these needs into account”, continued Mr. Desjardins-Siciliano.\nAs co-chairman of the National We Day This link open a window, VIA Rail’s President and CEO spoke to an audience of 16,000 youths about taking action and making choices that are good for the planet, such as transport sharing and taking the train. He also addressed community and business leaders at several Chambers of Commerce in Southwest Ontario including London, Stratford, Sarnia and Windsor, where VIA Rail is working to increase and improve train services in 2016. Finally, VIA Rail’s plan for dedicated tracks was presented at both The Canadian Council for Public-Private Partnerships This link open a window in Toronto and the Institut pour le partenariat public-privé This link open a window in Montréal.\nIn an effort to expand its service offering and increase its passenger base, VIA Rail added more train departures to the summer schedule between Montréal-Toronto and Montréal-Ottawa, and additional stops at key stations in the Corridor.\nTo attract even more people to its trains, VIA Rail launched the new, comprehensive “Who’s On Board” marketing campaign, which highlights real stories from VIA Rail’s train-loving passengers. “Although we were hoping to capture the true experience of people who take the train, we were not expecting the heartfelt and inspiring stories and testimonials volunteered by clients and we thank them whole-heartedly for their participation”, concluded Yves Desjardins-Siciliano.\nSource:- VIA Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T18:10:41.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
