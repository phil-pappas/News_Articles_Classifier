And you are more than that” on a giant piece of butcher’s paper.\n“We were trying to think of ideas of how we could serve the underclassmen and make the most impact,” senior student Hannah Hancock told local news station KWCH12 .\n“Especially as freshmen and sophomores, you’re trying to find your identity and who you are and we want them to find their identity in God and in Christ and not in a mirror and not what their outward appearance looks like.”\n“No beauty shines brighter than that of a good heart.” Photo: Trinity Academy. Source: Supplied\nJordan Melugin, another senior at Trinity Academy, says positive body image messages are desperately needed.\n“Everywhere you look you hear people talking about being body-shamed or hating their image,” she said.\n“I think it’s easy to forget when you are just caught up in everyday life so I think whenever you look up and expect to see yourself and you see something positive like, you are made in God’s image.”\nWhile the covers will eventually be removed, Jordan hopes they will have a long-lasting effect.\n“I really hope that people will see this and see that there are girls out there who are encouraging other girls to just be who they are,” said Jordan. “So I just hope that it continues growing on that.”\n“People are like Oreos ... the good stuff is on the inside”.
