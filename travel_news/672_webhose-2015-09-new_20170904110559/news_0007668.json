The revamped hardware is major overhaul over the last Apple TV, which was released in 2012.Available in October in 80 countries, the new Apple TV will come in two versions. For a 32Gb version, it will cost consumers $149, and a 64Gb will kick up the price tag to $199. The third generation device -- that now costs $69 -- only offered 8GB of flash memory.Many of the other new hardware features had already been leaked. The new Apple TV features beefier processor with Apple's 64-bit A8 chip. The new box also has Bluetooth 4.0, 802.11ac WiFi with MIMO as well as an infrared receiver.The revamped controller has a glass touch screen on top allows users to smoothly move around menus as well as open up new ways of playing games. The new controller also an accelerometer and gyroscope for motion control in games. A dedicated voice button on the controller allows users to quickly access Apple's intelligent assistant, Siri.Apple spent a lot of time at the event showing off the improved user interface as well as what kinds of new apps are now possible on the new Apple TV. With the new Apple TV, Apple is introducing a new operating system based on iOS that it's calling tvOS. More importantly, Apple is opening up the hardware to app developers.“Our vision for television is simple and perhaps a little provocative,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook at the event. “We believe the future of TV is apps.”By opening up the hardware for third-party apps, the Apple TV could become a major new platform and move Apple into interesting new opportunities.There will now be an Apple TV app store that works similar to iPhone app store, with screens showing featured apps, best selling apps and different categories of apps.Apple showed off a number of demos from developers who were given special early access to the new Apple TV developer kit. Games were an emphasis. Existing iOS games can be ported over to the Apple TV -- and users can put down their iPhone and pick up where they left off on the Apple TV. Games never before released on the iPad or iPhone are coming to the Apple TV too -- Activision is bringing Guitar Hero, for example, to the new Apple TV.Outside of games, Apple demonstrated how Apple TV apps can offer different ways of interacting with content and streaming video. In a Major League Baseball app demo, users can take a look at all the games in a current season and go deeper into stats and highlight reels. A user can open up multiple games and have them play at the same time, as well as bring up live stats with a button swipe.\"That shows the power of Apple TV,\" said Eddy Cue, senior vice president of Internet software and service of Apple, at the event. \"You take a linear video and now it's interactive.\" The user interface also gets an overhaul that's much cleaner than previous versions of the Apple TV. On the new home screen, users can select things like the new Apple TV App Store, photos, Apple Music and other apps. Searching for TVs and movies is easier on the new Apple TV. Users will be shown streaming options across a number of services. At launch time, Apple will look search across iTunes, Netflix, Hulu, HBO and Showtime. But the company said it'd be working on integrating other services over time.Siri plays a big part in searching for content. Users can ask Siri for the latest movies and ask for specific categories like action films or comedy. From there, users can tell Siri to further narrow their search to filter for things like release date or which actors are in the film.At any time, the user can press the Siri button on the controller and ask it a question. In a demo, for example, Apple showed how the user could ask who's staring in the movie and a list of actors will appear at the bottom of the screen while the movie continues to play. Another demo showed how the user could ask in the middle of a movie, \"What did she just say?\" and Siri will play back the movie 15 seconds before and turn on the captions.The Apple TV certainly isn't as big of a deal as something like the iPhone is for the company. Unit volume remains small. In January of this year, Cook said in an earnings call that it had sold 25 million Apple TVs in total. This hardware and software update brings Apple up to par with the other streaming media devices on the market (Roku 3 or the Amazon Fire TV), but the price hike makes it unlikely Apple will see that much more demand, said Paul Erickson, a senior analyst at research firm IHS Technology.The $149 and $199 price tags are quite a bit higher than competing streaming media devices from its fellow tech companies: Roku 3 ($99), Amazon Fire TV ($99) and Google Chromecast ($35). The Roku and Fire TV already have voice search as well as universal search capabilities that show users multiple streaming options. Where Apple really seems to be trying to differentiate itself in the updated hardware is with its new gaming capabilities.\"For the average person, they may not feel compelled to pay that $50 to $100 premium,\" said Erickson.It may be possible we just don't know the true capabilities of the new Apple TV. A new app ecosystem could make it more competitive than other products one day. For example, Apple has been rumored to be getting into its own TV programs and movies, but that doesn't seem to be ready at this time . Based on the demos and features we saw on Wednesday, Erickson isn't convinced it's enough to bring in new users outside of diehard Apple fans.And Apple has been falling behind its competitors in this market. Recent data shows Apple TV has fallen to fourth place of most popular streaming media devices in the U.S. based on 2014 figures, according to data by research firm Park Associates released in August . Based on numbers from IHS, Chromecast has come out of nowhere to become the top selling streaming media device. The streaming media device category had an install base of 59 million in 2014 and will grow to 220 million by 2020, according to estimates from IHS.", "external_links": ["http://www.parksassociates.com/blog/article/pr-aug2015-steaming-media-landscape"], "published": "2015-09-10T04:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T00:53:24.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
