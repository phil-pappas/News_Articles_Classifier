However, more than half of UK adults are classified as overweight or obese, which shows that keeping your body healthy isn’t about a one-off blitz of cutbacks and calorie counting. Getting rid of the weight and keeping it off is about small, sustainable changes that help to keep your blood sugar levels stable, so you’re not tempted to binge on things that aren’t good for you. “Low-calorie diets don’t work in the long term,” says Zoe Harcombe in her book Stop Counting Calories, Start Losing Weight . “They may work in the short term, and then only if you can stick to them. “The problem is that our bodies adjust to the continued starvation, and weight loss slows or even stops altogether. Then our bodies need less food to survive on a daily basis, so if we go back to eating the same food we ate before, we actually put on weight.” A review of 31 long-term dieting studies showed that most people who diet end up heavier That explains why a review of 31 long-term dieting studies showed that most people who diet end up heavier. So if you’re not counting calories or cutting carbs, what can you do to help yourself shed those pounds? “Most experts agree that banning foods is psychologically counterproductive,” Harcombe says. So, if you can’t imagine a life without chocolate, don’t say you’re never going to eat it again. But do acknowledge that eating it daily isn’t going to help you lose weight – not least because it tends to cause a spike in blood sugar, followed by a crash that leaves you craving more. And if you do want to eat chocolate, opt for a small amount of the darker versions that contain less sugar and tend not to cause sugar spikes. Here are some more simple swaps that can help… Swap margarine for butter Almost all nutritionists advocate eating what they term “real” rather than processed foods. Recent research suggests there is no evidence that eating higher amounts of saturated fat – the sort of fat found in butter – raises the risk of death, heart disease, stroke or diabetes. Whereas eating trans fats, of the type that used to be found in margarine, was linked to an increased risk of death or heart disease. Swap carbs for veg Five a day? Seven a day? TEN a day? The advice around how many portions of fruit and veg you should be eating can be confusing, but generally the message is the more the better. When it comes to refined carbs, such as white rice, pasta and bread, the opposite is true. So why not kill two birds with one stone? Switch spaghetti for thinly sliced or spiralised courgette; use grated, blanched cauliflower in place of rice; and try using aubergine slices instead of pasta when you’re making lasagne. Swap regular for decaf Some research suggests that, in some people, caffeine can cause blood sugar levels to spike, in the same way that eating something sweet does, meaning that when your blood sugar drops again, you crave something sweet to “stabilise” it. Other studies have found that caffeine can raise levels of cortisol, the hormone associated with fat being stored around the belly that is associated with a greater risk of several diseases. The solution? Ideally, stick to naturally caffeine-free herbal teas, or, if you must have a real cuppa, go for the decaf variety. So you really want to lose that weight? • Three tips for healthy eating Don’t keep anything in the house that you don’t want to eat. If you know there’s chocolate in the cupboard or biscuits in the tin, it’s a lot harder to avoid giving in to temptation. • Make life easy Processed supermarket ready meals may be a no-no, but an alternative is batch cooking that lets you leave a portion or two in the freezer. • Never say never Forbidding anything just makes it more desirable. You should aim to be healthy most of the time, but a weekly indulgence won’t hurt – and will probably keep you on track in the long run.
