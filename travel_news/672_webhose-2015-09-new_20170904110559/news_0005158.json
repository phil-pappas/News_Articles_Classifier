I never use them, and there's no way of deleting them, so I put them aside to keep them from cluttering up my phone. In an interview with BuzzFeed's John Paczkowski , Apple CEO Tim Cook was queried on Apple's \"junk drawer\" problem and he showed the company may be willing to relent in some cases.“This is a more complex issue than it first appears,” he told BuzzFeed News. “There are some apps that are linked to something else on the iPhone. If they were to be removed they might cause issues elsewhere on the phone. There are other apps that aren’t like that. So over time, I think with the ones that aren’t like that, we’ll figure out a way [for you to remove them].\"Apple has added a number of these default apps with each iOS update. Some are more popular than others, such as the Safari web browser. Others just take up space, with alternative third-party apps offering a much better experience.Cook admitted that all these default weren't always in the best interest of the user, and Apple wants to keep its users happy. He continued: \"It’s not that we want to suck up your real estate; we’re not motivated to do that. We want you to be happy. So I recognize that some people want to do this, and it’s something we’re looking at.”Cook didn't give any hints on when it might ease up on this policy.", "external_links": ["http://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/apples-junk-drawer-problem#.gi19qax0aM", "http://www.buzzfeed.com/johnpaczkowski/twenty-minutes-with-tim-cook?utm_term=.cc5aKKJWg#.wfdK18Vl8P"], "published": "2015-09-16T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-15T23:34:41.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
