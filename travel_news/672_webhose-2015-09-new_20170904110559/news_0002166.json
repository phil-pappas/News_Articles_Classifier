Located close to the South Platte River, it’s near the heart of the city’s downtown and is one of the country’s few amusement parks in an urban area. During its operating season, riders’ screams reverberate in the Mile-High City. \nRoller coasters have been part of Denver’s skyline since 1995, but Elitch’s history goes back much farther than that. In 1890, the Elitch family converted their farm in the far reaches of northwest Denver into a public botanical garden and zoo. Through the years, the popular summer attraction added a playhouse, a ballroom (which featured nationally known big bands in its heyday), and, starting in the 1920’s, amusement rides. \nThe original Elitch Gardens closed in 1994, and the new downtown location opened the following year. Starting in 1999, it was known as Six Flags Elitch Gardens until the park chain sold the property in 2007. \nElitch has a decent collection of coasters and thrill rides to lure riders in. Among its more unique thrill machines is Sidewinder. Instead of a traditional lift hill, the coaster uses an electric winch to launch the train forwards and backwards at 45 mph into a 56-foot tall loop. \nOther coasters include Mind Eraser and Boomerang, two off-the-shelf rides found at a number of other parks. The former is an inverted coaster with trains that are suspended beneath the track. Riders’ legs dangle from the ski lift-like cars. The latter is a shuttle coaster that sends its trains racing forwards and then backwards through a series of inversions. \nThe 200-foot-tall Tower of Doom drop ride and 250-foot Observation Tower offer nice views of the city as well as the Rocky Mountains. (Although Tower of Doom riders may be too jittery to appreciate the view). \nFor visitors looking to cool down, the shoot-the-chutes Shipwreck Falls ride creates an enormous plume of water. Disaster Canyon, meanwhile, threatens to drench passengers as its rafts navigate the rapids. The interactive shooter dark ride, Ghost Blasters, includes laser guns that riders use to rack up points as they navigate spooky corridors. \nFamilies will find plenty of kiddie rides including a toned-down coaster and a pint-sized train. There are also shows geared to tykes. The park offers shows for a wider audience in its Trocadero Theatre. \nBiggest Thrills: Using a magnetic launch, Half Pipe propels its riders back and forth on a U-shaped track and pulls a potent 4.5Gs. The train looks like a giant snowboard, and the seats are arranged on two spinning platforms. Elitch offers two upcharge attractions for the brave-hearted: The reverse-bungee ride, Sling Shot, catapults passengers to 80 mph, while XLR8R slowly lifts riders 150 feet before releasing them into a bungee-like freefall. \nIconic Rides: The Twister II coaster is a well-regarded woodie that climbs 100 feet and reaches a top speed of 55 mph. It is an homage to Mr. Twister, a classic wooden coaster that opened in 1964 at the park’s original location. The carousel dates back to 1928 when it debuted as Elitch Gardens’ first amusement ride. \nWater Park: Included with general admission, Elitch’s water park is well stocked with all kinds of slides and rides. Among the highlights is Slidezilla, a hybrid contraption that opened in 2015. It shoots four-passenger rafts into a bowl and then spits them into a highly banked wall. Other attractions include the funnel slide, Tube Top, speed slides, a family raft ride, and a wave pool. \nSpecial Events: A holdover from the Six Flags era, Elitch calls its annual fall Halloween event Fright Fest. It includes family-friendly activities during the day and horror-filled haunted mazes at night. \nDining Around the Park: Elitch offers the usual amusement park fare, including burgers, funnel cakes, and corn dogs. Its most ambitious eatery is Blue Moon Beer Garden. The sports bar has nachos, sausage sliders, wraps, and 12 beers (including the park’s own brand) on tap.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T19:41:13.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
