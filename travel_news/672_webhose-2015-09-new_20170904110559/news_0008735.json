The medical-purpose visits to Dubai generated Dh1 billion in revenue during the six-month period, Linda Abdullah Ali, head of the medical tourism office at the health regulation department of the DHA, said. She did not give the percentage of growth over the same period in 2014.\n“Around 40 per cent of [the medical tourists] are from outside the country,” Ali told reporters at the 10th World Health Tourism Congress in Dubai Sunday.\n“In the third and fourth quarter, we expect steady growth [in medical tourist numbers] of at least 12-15 per cent,” she said.\nDubai’s medical visitor numbers are expected to grow by around 12 per cent annually. By 2020, the emirate is anticipated to welcome more than 500,000 medical tourists and generate Dh2.6 billion in revenue, marking a 20 per cent growth over 2015, Ali said.\nDubai had set a target last year to welcome 500,000 medical tourists by 2020, but it will now exceed it by 12-13 per cent, she said.\nThe emirate aims to achieve its 2020 target by continuing to promote Dubai as a medical tourism destination to neighbouring Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, Africa, Asia and the UK, and offering medical tourism packages, according to Ali.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T02:05:08.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
