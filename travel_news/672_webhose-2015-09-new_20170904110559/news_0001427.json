Both English and French are spoken here. The bilingual city is strewn with cathedrals, exuding rich European charms. It has earned its reputation as \"Little Paris\" in North America. In the old section of the city, travelers can cruise through elegant streets of French style and old castles on a horse-drawn sightseeing wagon, or trek up to the top of Mount Royal in the last glow of the sunset, taking in the tranquil Saint Lawrence River that flows slowly and the golden Gothic spires whose reflections are caught by ripples. This laidback city attracts hordes of travelers from around the world. \nThe forthcoming Beijing-Montreal service is part of Air China's move to solidify its presence on the China-Canada market, meeting the ever increasing demand for air travel between the two countries. Currently, Air China offers 10 flights per week between China and Canada. By its strategic joint operations with Air Canada, a member carrier of the Star Alliance, Air China puts its code on Air Canada's flights between Vancouver and other six selected Canadian cities including Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal. The Beijing-Montreal service will not only promote the economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries, but also benefit travelers between Southeast Asia, Japan and South Korea on one side and Montreal on the other, offering more easy and convenient travel options for connecting passengers between Asia and the Americas and other parts of the world. \nIn 2015, Air China has been cementing its global route network with its hub in Beijing and expanding its footprint in the Americas. After Air China put Boeing 747-8, a new member of the Boeing 747 family, into service on its Beijing-New York route at the beginning of the year and increased its Beijing-Los Angeles service to three daily flights in May, the forthcoming Beijing-Montreal service will be a worthy addition to the carrier's existing Beijing-Vancouver nonstop service. Currently, Air China serves 7 destinations in North America, including New York, Washington, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, Vancouver and Hawaii, offering over 140 flights per week operated with Boeing 777-300ER and Boeing 747-8 aircraft. Comfortable cabin environment and attentive services guarantee passengers a truly pleasant travel experience. \nThe flights CA879/CA880 Beijing-Montreal are operated three times a week on Tuesday, Friday and Sunday. The outbound flight departs from Beijing at 13:00 Beijing time and arrives in Montreal at 13:50 local time. The return flight departs from Montreal at 16:20 local time and arrives in Beijing at 18:00 the following day. The flights are to be operated with Boeing 777-300ER, an aircraft type quite popular with the world's business travelers. Its First Class and Business Class are outfitted with full-flat seats and a central bar. All classes of service offer personal AVOD, power outlets, accessible toilets for the disabled and mood lighting system which can mimic the wonderful moments from sunrise to sunset, guaranteeing a truly pleasant journey for passengers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T10:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T13:52:34.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
