Its 86 rooms all have floor-to-ceiling windows (get a Meadow Suite with a private terrace garden) and the spacious ground-floor Crosby Bar and Terrace does signature cocktails and burgers at night. \n  Crosby Street Hotel The Greenwich Hotel, Tribeca \nThe chic design hotel, part-owned by Robert De Niro, has a Morocco meets the tropics aesthetic, with elements of Europe and the Orient thrown in. The free-flowing ground floor mimics a Tribeca loft, but instead of cold minimalism you get warm polished oak floors, comfy floral sofas, lush palms and Moorish tiles. None of the 88   alike, some, like the elegant white and cream-colored 325 sq ft Courtyard rooms channel classical Europe; others, such as 625 sq ft Studio suites with their private saunas are more Scandinavian in influence. High corner rooms come with Hudson River views. \nRead more: the best hotels in New York Ace Hotel, Midtown \nOpened in 1904 as the Breslin Hotel, this historic building in a nondescript section of The Flatiron was the famous West Coast Ace Hotel brand’s first East Coast opening. The historic 1904 building used to be the Breslin Hotel, and has all the reclaimed building trademarks of other Ace Hotels with a mix of industrial décor and retro styling. The 280 rooms range from “suites” to “smalls” to “bunks” and are as eclectic as the clientele. Expect en-suite bathrooms in the suites; while the smallest rooms are literally two bunks in a room with a sink and plain white décor. Michelin-starred Brit chef April Bloomfield’s Breslin Bar and Restaurant is worth a visit alone. \n  Ace Hotel \nPhoto: Unspecified Wythe Hotel, Williamsburg \nThis hip 70-room hotel housed in a converted 1901 factory building on the Williamsburg, Brooklyn waterfront has great views of Manhattan from the upper floors. The style is industrial meets contemporary: solid original brickwork spruced up with addition of a three-storey glass and aluminum structure, to the original rooftop and loft-size guest rooms with timber ceilings and over-sized windows. Many have floor-to-ceiling views of the Manhattan skyline and East River. Farm-to-table ground-floor restaurant Reynard is a hit, but don’t miss cocktails at sunset at sixth-floor bar and terrace, Ides. \n  Wythe Hotel \nPhoto: matthew williams \nRead more: the best hotels in New York The Ludlow, Lower East Side \nThis Lower East Side debut for hipster hotelier Sean MacPherson and partners is set in reclaimed and abandoned red-brick building around the corner from the iconic Katz’s Deli. The design pays homage to the neighbourhood’s gritty, creative past when you could rent large lofts for small change. Elements of the décor have been handpicked by MacPherson, including the mosaic-tiled floors and chandeliers in the lobby, sheepskin throws in guestrooms, and ornate lamps and rugs personally sourced from Morocco, India and Indonesia. William Boroughs would feel at home. Rooms have dark-stained hardwood floors, white ceilings with exposed wood beams, Bellini Italian linens and exotic accents such as Indian silk rugs and black and gold handmade Moroccan lamps. The one to get: the Skybox Loft with 180 degree   The Ludlow Gramercy Park Hotel, Gramercy Park \nIan Schrager went all out when he partnered with artist Julian Schnabel to re-imagine this landmark on the northern edge of private Gramercy Park. Celebrities, suburbanites on dirty weekends and successful artists retreat to this dark and moody hotel, which has a rotating collection of 20th-century art, including pieces by Andy Warhol, Damien Hirst and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Schnabel’s Renaissance-revival look was a revelation when the hotel opened in 2006, and it continues to dazzle guests with its red-velvet sofas, Harlequin floors, grand mirrors and Louis XV chairs. The 185 guest rooms and suites show off Schnabel’s quirky sense of taste, with leather desks, velvet curtains, mahogany drinking cabinets and marble vanities in the bathrooms. Some are small (at 200 square feet) but all come with amenities you’ll want to stuff in your suitcase, from the likes of Le Labo and Aesop. \nRead more: the best hotels in New York SoHo Grand, SoHo \nFrom the vaulted ceilings, towering columns, and velvet drapes of the high-ceiling Salon lobby, to the chic guest rooms and happening nightlife in the Grand Bar and Club Room restaurant, this is an elegant merging of Old World charm and contemporary style. The interiors are a gorgeous merging of old world charm and contemporary style, from the vaulted ceilings, towering columns, and velvet drapes of the high-ceiling Salon lobby area which evokes classic European and Asian hotels, to the chic guest rooms and happening nightlife in the Grand Bar and Club Room restaurant. The 353 custom-designed   all the mod cons and luxuries (iPods, gourmet mini bar, Frette Bath Robes) as well as CO Bigelow bath amenities. Walls are decorated with black and white Howard Greenberg Gallery photographs that celebrate 1940’s and ‘50’s New York. \n  SoHo Grand Refinery Hotel, Midtown \nThis Midtown stunner shows no sign of slowing down. The live music at Winnie’s Jazz Bar in the lobby greets guests most nights, though you may need to raise your voice to be heard above the sax. The tools displayed behind the front desk are the first of several nods to the building’s past as a hub for the Garment District’s millinery trade. Much of the charm of the original Gothic skyscraper has been preserved, from the high ceilings to the wood-floor rooms, although the décor is never overdone. And while hipster touches abound (the staff sport suspenders and denim uniforms and, a few, waxed facial hair) there’s nothing over the top. Some rooms have views of the Empire State Building. \nRead more: the best hotels in New York The Mercer, SoHo \nHipster hotelier Andrew Balazs may be most famous for his slate of uber-trendy Standard hotels, but this elegant boutique property on a cobbled street in SoHo opened long before they did, and, like its sister property Chateau Marmont in LA, it has stood the test of time and trend. The open-plan feel and loft-like rooms are a perfect fit for SoHo, and the ground-floor Mercer Kitchen is a hit with the fashion set, among them Karl Lagerfeld. The landmark structure was built in 1890 for John Jacob Astor II and later became artist lofts and studios. Which is what it is today in a sense: a home-from-home for international creatives. \n  Mercer The NoMad, Flatiron District \n  Garcia gives a bohemian-chic makeover to a 12-storey turn-of-the-century Beaux Arts building in the Flatiron District. The 168 sumptuous rooms, two swanky bars and a restaurant overseen by superstar chef Daniel Humm of Eleven Madison Park fame, make it one of the hottest hotels in town. Inspired by the Paris apartment he lived in as a child, Jacques Garcia’s interiors combine European elegance – white walls, soaring ceilings, tiled floors – with funky, decadent touches such as tapestry-covered antique furniture, worn and faded Persian rugs, a 200-year-old fireplace, an antique staircase, and a glass atrium-like structure on the ground floor that houses the restaurant. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/hotel/138852/The-NoMad-hotel-New-York-review.html", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T17:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T18:39:46.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
