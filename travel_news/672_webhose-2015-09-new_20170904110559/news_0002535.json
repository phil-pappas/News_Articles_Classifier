They’re fantastic but also fantastically expensive, and most of us don’t have that kind of money to throw around.\nWith that in mind, here are some great value hotels around the world you should check out. They’re not all cheap, but some are quite reasonable, and all of them offer bang for your buck.\nHanoi You can find nice four-star properties for $100 a night or so, but one of the great things about Vietnam and Southeast Asia is that luxurious properties are relatively affordable. The Sofitel Legend Metropole in Hanoi is a colonial masterpiece with big, swaying ceiling fans, perfectly appointed rooms, a fantastic spa and a real sense of style. Somerset Maugham used to stay here, as did Jane Fonda back in her Vietnam protest days. I recently spotted rooms for as little as $200 a night. Not cheap, but it’s a great property and a reasonable splurge for a historic, five-star hotel. 15 Ngo Quyen St., Hoan Kiem, Hanoi. sofitel.com .\nSan Francisco The Seal Rock Inn feels like one of those old motor lodges with doors fronting outside hallways. There’s a central courtyard with a small pool that’s heated only in summer. (Hey, this ain’t Palm Springs, folks.) There’s free Wi-Fi and free underground parking, a huge bonus in San Francisco. You’re out about as far west as you can go in the city, so you’ll need to take public transit or a car to the major sites. But you’re a few small steps from Ocean Beach and from great seaside hikes, and a short walk to shops on Geary Street. Rooms aren’t anything to write home about, but the price is hard to beat. Rooms from $135 for two people. 545 Point Lobos Ave., San Francisco. sealrockinn.com .\nLondon The Ibis Blackfriars is in a great part of south London; a short walk from the Thames River and super close to the Underground. You’d be foolish to expect large rooms in an old city like London, but mine was a decent size and had all the amenities I needed, including free Wi-Fi and a bright dining area with a solid breakfast. The Cut is a great street nearby for shopping and restaurants, and the Old Vic theater is a short walk away. Rooms advertised at $145 and up. 49 Blackfriars Road, London. ibis.com .\nHawaii’s Big Island Volcano Village Lodge is a small collection of rooms and separate huts that operates as a B&B in the rain forest of the Big Island. The landscaping is lush and beautiful, and units are well-appointed with considerable privacy. Look for a nice Hawaiian feeling without too much kitsch, as well as huge windows and small decks or Jacuzzi tubs. It’s a short drive to see bubbling volcanoes and the stark, beautiful coastline of Hawaii. Rooms in October from $280. Not cheap, but not bad for Hawaii and quite different from the usual beachfront condo. 19-4183 Road E, Volcano, Hawaii. volcanovillagelodge.com .\nVancouver The Burrard was doing the early ’60s Mad Men thing long before others cottoned to the idea. It’s a former motor lodge (circa 1956) near the Burrard Bridge that was converted several years ago into a sleek boutique hotel. Rooms are of decent size, but some bathrooms are pretty small. There are funky signs all around and colorful plastic chairs in the courtyard, which also features a pretty garden. A spot for hipsters, or hipster wannabes. Features include free phone calls within North America and Nespresso coffee machines in the rooms. Rooms in October from around $150 at press time. 1100 Burrard St., Vancouver. theburrard.com .\nNew York The Pod Hotel has tiny rooms, some with bunk beds. The sink looks like it was lifted off an airplane, all shiny silver bits with a basin barely big enough for your hands. Oh, and the shower might be down the hall, depending on what kind of pod you want (single, full, bunks, etc.). But the price is decent by Manhattan standards, with rooms (did I mention they’re tiny?) from $200 in October. There’s also free Wi-Fi and a fun lobby/communal area and an indoor-outdoor cafe. They’re adding a Pod Hotel in Washington, D.C., next year. Two locations in New York: 145 E. 39th St. and 230 E. 51st St. thepodhotel.com .\nSydney Most North Americans don’t go to Sydney for a night. So how about a serviced apartment where you can spread out a bit over a few days at a studio or even a two-bedroom unit? At the Quest Potts Point you can cook your own meals, but you’re also surrounded by one of the city’s coolest neighborhoods, with wonderful Thai and Japanese restaurants and many others. It’s walking distance to the harbor and to great shopping, and there’s a nice rooftop garden with great views of the city skyline. Rooms in October from about $125. 15 Springfield Ave., Potts Point. questapartments.com.au .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T06:45:46.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
