Speaking to reporters on a plane to New York, the Prime Minister said Mr Assad had no “long-term” future but suggested he could remain in place during a transition period. He added that reports of Russia’s increased military presence in Syria would not affect plans to join air strikes on Isil in the country but repeated backing from MPs would be needed. It comes with government sources indicating Britain is now open to Mr Assad remaining in post in the short-term ahead of a meeting of world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly. 'People who break international law should be subject to international law and that certainly hasn’t changed' David Cameron Russia, Germany and America have all recently talked up the possibility of keeping Mr Assad in place during a transition period in a deal to end the four-year Syrian civil war and help defeat Isil. Mr Cameron said: “Assad can’t be part of Syria’s future. He’s butchered his own people, he has helped create this conflict and this migration crisis, he’s one of the great recruiting sergeants for Isil. He can’t play a part in the future for Syria and that position hasn’t changed. “Obviously, conversations about how we bring about transition are very important and that’s what we need to see greater emphasis on.” Pushed on whether Mr Assad could temporarily stay on as Syrian leader, Mr Cameron said there was no “long-term” role for the president and refused to be drawn further. Asked if he still believed Mr Assad should face criminal trial, Mr Cameron said: “People who break international law should be subject to international law and that certainly hasn’t changed.” The comments complicate Syrian negotiations expected to take place in New York over the next 48 hours, raising the prospect of Britain demanding Mr Assad face trial at the International Criminal Court as part of any deal. Mr Cameron has previously accused Mr Assad of using chemical weapons against his own people during an address two years ago in the House of Commons. The Prime Minister spoke out over the Syrian children gassed to death as he attempted to convince MPs to approve air strikes in the country. Dozens of Tory MPs eventually rebelled, inflicting a damaging defeat on the Prime Minister. Mr Cameron is planning to return to Parliament again to get approval for air strikes over Syria to counter Isil’s rise in the country, but told reporters there is no timetable for calling a vote. However he said reports of Russian military action in Syria would not alter such plans. “I don’t think the position has changed here. I’ve always said that it’s important that Isil’s defeated in Syria as in Iraq,” he said. “We play a role in that already, helping other countries that are doing the active work. But nothing on that front has changed. To go further we need parliamentary backing.” telepolitics Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T07:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T08:38:35.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
