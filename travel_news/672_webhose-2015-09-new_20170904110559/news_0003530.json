Gaming PCs, the souped-up desktops and laptops used by enthusiasts, constitute only around 2.5% of the total user base, but they account for approximately 75 terawatt hours, or 20%, of the total consumed by laptops, desktops and gaming consoles. In all, the power bill for these gaming PCs comes to $10 billion a year.By 2020, gaming PCs could constitute 10% of the user base. If left unchecked, these systems could consume 120 terawatt hours a year and rack up $18 billion in energy bills.That’s the bad news. The good news is that savings of close to 75% can be trimmed through retrofits, component changes and strategic operational settings that do not impact overall performance. Speed and efficiency, in other words, don’t have to be enemies. The Quest for Real Savings To get around the problem of measuring consumption by “nameplate” or maximum consumption, the researchers benchmarked components used in high-end systems as well as developed different use-case scenarios: the estimated 10 million extreme gamers might use their PCs in game mode for 7.2 hours a day on average while typical gamers might only use their systems for gaming 4.4 hours per day. They also analyzed energy ratings of the top ten-selling gamer PCs from a component perspective.Some of the results:\nAn extreme gamer playing 7.2 hours of games a day can consume 1890 kilowatt hours a year, or around $200 a year in power. With time-of-use programs and other tariffs, the total could go to $500. The system will also cause 1700 pounds of CO2 to be generated at power plants. A typical gamer will consume 1394 kilowatt hours. t To put that in perspective, a typical gaming console uses around 134 kilowatt hours while an average household PC will consum3 246 kilowatt hours. An Energy Star rated fridge chews up nearly 500 kilowatt hours. t Approximately half of the graphics processing units, i.e. a discrete graphics chips, are sold to the consumer market while the other half go to businesses. Once a standard component in retail PCs, separate GPUs are now mostly found in gaming systems. t Liquid cooling, where liquid flows across a heat exchange plate, did not have an impact on energy consumption. t Right-sizing the power supply can have a noticeable impact on power consumption. Generally, power supplies are most efficient when operating at 50% capacity. After that, their efficiency can dip slightly, or substantially, depending on the brand. The voluntary “80plus” program to raise power supply efficiency started over a decade ago spawned a significant improvement in power supply performance. t Memory and storage are a bright spot. A 10TB hard drive can consume 10 watts while an equivalently-sized solid state drive will consume 2.6 watts. t Elevating clock speed from 3.7 to 4.5 GHz increased peak power requirements during the Cinebench CPU test from 167 to 217 watts (23 %), but benchmark scores increased by 16 %. t Better cooling systems during a benchmark test (Unigine) dropped the temperature from 91 Celsius to 65 Celsius, improving system health and reducing both noise and energy consumption. t Adjusting processor and GPU settings during active and standby modes can reduce power by 26 to 30% on particular benchmarks with no decrease in performance.", "external_links": ["http://evanmills.lbl.gov/pubs/pdf/Taming-the-Energy-Use-of-Gaming-Computers.pdf"], "published": "2015-09-08T06:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T02:01:22.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
