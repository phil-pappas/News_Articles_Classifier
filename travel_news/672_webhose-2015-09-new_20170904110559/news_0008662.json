Because air travel can be expensive, frequent flyer miles are one of the great money savers of modern life, and if you are not taking every opportunity to accrue them you are missing out, especially if you travel for work. If you take even a single flight for business, you should absolutely be signed up to a frequent flyer scheme. That is because while you are taking all that time ‘going to work’ you can still use that flight to accrue miles for yourself. Programmes such as British Airways’ On Business are a win-win – while your business picks up On Business Points for each of your flights booked through it, using your frequent flyer number on all bookings also means you are racking up Avios that you can spend on personal travel and other perks. You get Avios, your business gets On Business Points and everyone saves. Businesses that buy more flights can earn a points bonus the higher up the On Business Tiers they move You can redeem your Avios on reward flights to any worldwide destination where there’s availability, with British Airways or oneworld partners. You pay for your reward flight with Avios, plus a cash amount for taxes, fees and carrier charges. Avios can also be spent on hotel rooms and car hire so you can save on the whole holiday, and even if you do not fly all that often you can add to your Avios stash by using British Airways credit cards and shopping with a wide variety of retailers. The benefits for businesses signing up to frequent flyer programmes such as On Business are clear, too. On Business offers the option of an upfront discount on a flight instead of the points, and businesses that buy more flights can earn a points bonus the higher up the On Business Tiers they move. All the more reason to convince your employer to sign up and allow you to start planning your next getaway. Business travel really does not have to be all work and no play. • Find out more about how to receive business travel rewards by visiting British Airways On Business", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T13:37:51.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
