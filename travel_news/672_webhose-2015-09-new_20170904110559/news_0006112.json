Many years ago, countless pilgrims and travelers realized that and couldn´t help but stop here to bathe in the natural healing sulphur springs. And while they relaxed in these waters, they enjoyed a fantastic view over the fresco-covered monastery of St. John Lampadistis, today an UNESCO world heritage site, and over the surrounding vineyards, orchards and pine forests. Legend has it that the Apostle Paul had baptised the first ever bishop of Cyprus here on his journey to Paphos.\nWhere exactly is Kalapanayiotis? On the steep incline of the Marathasa valley in the northern Troodos mountains in Cyprus. Those who are travelling to Cyprus should not miss the opportunity to stay in this traditional Cypriot village. Owner Johan Papadouris, who traveled the world and returned after 30 years, managed to refurbish today´s Casale Panayiotis bit by bit and transform it into a true dream-hideaway for visitors.\nEach guest room was once a traditional village home and has been lovingly restored to the highest specification so that each has its own unique style and character. Every room retains original features wherever possible, such as stone walls, wooden beams and alcoves. Accommodation in a Comfort Studio Room starts at 75€ per night including breakfast.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T01:35:19.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
