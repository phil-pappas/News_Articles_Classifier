Tourism accounts for about 11 percent of Spain's output, and a busier season than usual should translate into a jobs spurt in a country where unemployment hovers at 22.4 percent, still the second-highest rate in Europe after Greece.\nHoliday firms and politicians are split about the benefits of a massive tourism influx for Spain over the longer term, however.\nData on tourists' spending in Spain varies, with some measures showing expenditure per head rising and others revealing a decline.\nBut many in the industry argue more needs to be done to encourage higher spending and renew Spain's image as more than just a cheap beach holiday and party spot and to attract visitors to its lesser known regions.\nSome cities, meanwhile, are feeling the burden of the big jump in visitors. Barcelona is trying to crack down on uncontrolled tourism amid fears it is spoiling the Catalan capital's charm.\n(Reporting by Sarah White and Robert Hetz; editing by Ralph Boulton)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T15:58:44.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
