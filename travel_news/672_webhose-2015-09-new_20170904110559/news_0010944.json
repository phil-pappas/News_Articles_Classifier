Vincent Browne 08 September 2015 07:49 AM\nWitnesses reported “chaotic scenes” at the Dublin Bay North ‘People’s Debate’ at Clontarf Castle.\nThe debate was being pre-recorded for broadcast on TV3 but became heated after several members of the audience began jeering Jobs Minister Richard Bruton and Equality Minister Áodhan O Riordáin.\nSeveral witnesses present told the Irish Independent that the event turned even more heated when the issue of water charges was brought up.\nAs the debate continued, a female member of the audience stood up and claimed that she was being “intimidated” as a result of her decision to applaud remarks made by Mr O Riordáin, a Labour Party TD.\nAs the tensions escalated, it is understood that Browne told the audience that the Gardaí were being called. But it was unclear last night whether such a call was made.\nMr O Riordáin later tweeted: “Just out of Vincent Browne debate circus. Others can tell you what happened. Nasty stuff.”\nA TV3 spokeswoman said they were not in a position to comment when contacted.\nThe Vincent Browne debate is due to be aired next week.\nAmong the other candidates that appeared were Fianna Fáil councillor Deirdre Heney and Independent TD Finian Mcgrath.", "external_links": ["http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/movies/article31001576.ece/83cda/ALTERNATES/h342/2015-02-18_ent_7103380_I3.JPG"], "published": "2015-09-08T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T14:05:42.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
