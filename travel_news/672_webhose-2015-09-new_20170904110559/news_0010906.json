That's on pace to easily eclipse the 23 firearm seizures in Memphis in 2014. \nOther miscues, also punishable by a $7,500 civil penalty, include improperly packing firearms in checked baggage and not giving the required notice to the airline. \n\"You can't just throw a gun into your suitcase,\" said TSA spokesman Mark Howell, who has been making the rounds of Southeastern airports to demonstrate how to legally store and ship guns and ammunition in the cargo holds of airliners. \n\"The TSA doesn't want to infringe on anybody's right to take a firearm with them when they travel,\" Howell said. \"We just want to make sure they're packed where they're not accessible during a flight.\" \nStanding behind a card table holding a hard plastic case, two dummy handguns and an ammunition container, Howell said increases in firearm ownership and air travel have kept him busy doing education programs. \n\"The reason I'm jumping around the country is we're seeing an increase in the number of guns being caught at checkpoints.\" The TSA recorded more than 1,600 seizures through July 31, compared to 1,025 in the first six months of 2014, Howell said. Seizures nationally last year totaled 2,212. \n\"It's continuing to increase,\" Howell added. \"More people are traveling and more people are owning firearms. The best thing we can do is get out there and educate people.\" \nFirearms can only travel in checked baggage, must be declared to airlines when the case is checked and must be stored, unloaded, in a locked, hard-sided container. \nTSA doesn't keep figures on how many firearms are legally shipped as luggage, but Howell estimated it's \"hundreds a day.\" He said two people have been cited in Memphis so far this year for failing to declare firearms in their checked bags, compared to nine cases last year. \nThe TSA has a web page that provides detailed instructions. \nHowell said he has recently done demonstrations in Huntsville, Alabama, and Nashville. \"The South is really gun heavy,\" he said. \nTips for a hassle-free experience: \nCheck for airline-specific rules and state gun laws at the traveler's destination. Arrive for flight 30 minutes earlier than normal. This allows time to declare the firearm at the airline ticket counter and stand by while it's scanned to make sure everything is secure. Make sure the case contains owner's name and contact information so authorities can get in touch if there's an issue. Make arrangements for the airline to have the case kept off the regular baggage claim carousel, where it might stand out visually and risk being grabbed by someone else. Have gun permit and license readily available to show authorities. Don't leave ammunition loose in the case. Either store it in a clip, removed from gun, or in an ammo carrying box.
