At an elevation of more than 7,000 feet (2,100 metres), Four Seasons Resort Rancho Encantado Santa Fe is a high altitude getaway with a plethora of activities this fall season.\nFall Festivals\nIt’s no secret that New Mexico is a haven for green chile lovers, and September celebrates the harvest of this delicious pepper. The 25th Annual Santa Fe Wine & Chile Fiesta , held September 23 to 27, 2015, is widely known as one of the best food and wine events of the Southwest. Four Seasons Chef Andrew Cooper and his culinary team at Terra invite guests to attend the following events in conjunction with the festival:\nWednesday, September 23: Chef demonstration and tasting at Santa Fe School of Cooking, 2:30-4:00 pm, USD 85 Wednesday, September 23: Reserve Tasting Reception with local artist on Terra Terrace atFour Seasons, 5:30-7:00 pm, free Thursday, September 24: Caymus Dinner with artist Michael Umphrey at Terra at Four Seasons, 6:00 pm, USD 150 for four-course dinner with wine pairings Friday, September 25: Artful Pairings – Wine, Bites and Art at Terra at Four Seasons sponsored by Ruinart and Caymus, 5:30-6:30 pm, free Saturday, September 26: Grand Tasting at The Santa Fe Opera, 1:00-4:00 pm, USD 150 Sunday, September 27: Ruinart Dirty Boots & Champagne Brunch on Monte Vista Terrace at Four Seasons, 11:00 am – 1:00 pm, USD 100\nAdditionally on Sunday, September 27, the Resort will host the 2nd Annual SFWC Gran Fondo bike ride . Gran Fondo, featuring celebrity chef riders and their gourmet food, is a 65 or 50-mile (105 or 80 kilometres) loop from the Resort, taking participants through the historic villages of Nambé, Cundiyo, Truchas and Chimayo. At the finish line, guests will celebrate at Four Seasons with tacos by Zacatecas and Ruinart.\nThe fun doesn’t end in September, as October 3-11, 2015 is the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta . The Resort will feature a special in-room dining menu for its guests visiting during this balloon extravaganza.\nOutdoor Adventures\nFor those thrill-seekers, the Resort’s Adventure Partners guides offer an array of outdoor excursions, the perfect time to see fall colours in northern New Mexico. The High Mountain Ramble from Adventure Partners starts with a scenic drive into the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, up to 10,350 feet (3,150 feet). From the Santa Fe Ski Basin, a guide leads guests on a moderate hike along mountain streams and aspen meadows to views of distant peaks.\nThe Rio en Medio tour, a moderate hike, takes guests on a trail that wanders through a canyon with a wide variety of vegetation types – oak trees, chokecherries, wild hops, prickly-pear cactus, cholla cactus, rose bushes, ponderosa pines and towering Douglas fir trees. The hike culminates at a shimmering pool and water cascade. For mountain bikers, the Pacheco Canyon Descent is an exhilarating downhill ride from the Santa Fe Ski Basin through a hidden known canyon of diverse ecosystems of pine, aspen groves, mountain streams, meadows and wildflowers. This three-hour popular family ride ends in a pinon and juniper-dotted landscape.\nThe Dale Ball Trail System, a 22-mile (35 kilometre) network of trails in the foothills of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, offers a red dirt single-track for an adrenaline-filled workout. There are opportunities for intermediate and advanced bikers alike, reaching unparalleled views of the surrounding mountains and Rio Grande Rift Valley.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:57:18.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
