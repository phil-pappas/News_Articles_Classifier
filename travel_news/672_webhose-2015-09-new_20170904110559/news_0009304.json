At these delectable restaurants throughout Australia’s famed wine regions, you’ll enjoy creative and flavourful meals paired with some of the finest wines you’ll have the pleasure of tasting. If you’re planning a trip to Western Australia’s Margaret River region, Victoria’s Yarra Valley, or South Australia’s Barossa Valley, be sure to stop at one of these winery delights.

Western Australia The chefs at Cullen ’s revamped restaurant source much of the garden produce used in its menu on-site, to deliver meals that are as simple as they are spectacular. \nFor a classy and elegant experience, pop into Leeuwin Estate . The wines are internationally renowned and the meals are unique and decadent: think Charred Kimberly tiger prawns, pressed duck leg and 45-day dry aged black angus sirloin. \nSituated in a surprising yet unpretentious elevated room, Vasse Felix (located within a vineyard of the same name) offers contemporary, light fare with a distinctly Japanese influence. \nSample the ideal accompaniment to wine, a charcuterie board, at Voyager , where you can make use of the beautiful terrace to enjoy your dinner with a view. \nSpeaking of views, the pararamic vista from Wills Domain’s dining terrace is second-to-none. Soak it all in alongside a contemporary Mediterranean menu and a beautiful drop of local wine. Milton Wordley/Getty Images 2. South Australia Penfold’s is world famous for its Grange wine, and it may become even more renowned for Magill , it’s onsite restaurant. Here you can enjoy contemporary Australian cuisine offered via two tasting menus, either five or eight courses, matched with local wines, of course. \nThe Louise at Appellation is one of The Barossa’s finest jewels, boasting an elegant dining room that offers light and classic food that makes good use of local and seasonal produce. \nThe McLaren Vale district is home to one of Australia’s most successful vineyard restaurants, d’Arry’s at D’Arenberg, where the fare is classically Australian: warm, friendly, informal and maybe just a little rough around the edges.

It prides itself on being a regional restaurant committed to sourcing ingredients locally, which is reflected in Esca’s earthy, wholesome menu. Be sure to leave room for dessert; you don’t want to miss the chocolate garden with chocolate pebbles, topped with mint moss and pudding. \nWhite linen, beautiful service and a traditional menu are the order of the day at Muse , the restaurant of Hungerford Hill Winery. Choose between the a la carte and tasting menu for a dining experience that strives for the “special”, rather than offering the same hum-drum restaurant meal you’ve had a million times before. Meanwhile, a trip to the Mornington Peninsula is simply not complete without a visit to the charmingly named Ten Minutes by Tractor. Originally formed in 1999 by three families who owned a cluster of vineyards all located within “10 minutes by tractor” of each other, the estate was bought by winemaker Martin Spedding in 2004 and it has thrived under his guidance. \n​Today, Ten Minutes By Tractor plows 34 hectares of vineyards to cultivate award-winning Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris and Tempranillo. In the on-site restaurant, chef Stuart Bell produces flavourful dishes that incorporates local, high quality produce – from the herbs and salad ingredients to vegetables plucked from their own kitchen garden – to create Asian and European inspired cuisine.
