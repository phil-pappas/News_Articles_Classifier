Jim Byers / Postmedia News Hunte's Gardens is a delightful spot in the hills of Barbados. There's a small beach with pretty sunsets at the low-key Beachcombers Hotel on St. Vincent. Trunk Bay on St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands might be the prettiest beach on the planet. A trip to Buck Island is a great way to explore St. Croix and take in some world-class snorkelling. The views of Antigua from Shirley Heights are among the best in the Caribbean. Share Adjust Comment Print Related \nIt’s almost time to start dreaming about that fall or winter getaway to the sunny Caribbean. With that in mind, here are some personal favourites, both well-known and off the proverbial beaten path. \nBARBADOS \nThe Crane Resort has a great setting on a hill overlooking a lovely beach, with a series of stunning pools and a lovely beach with good wave surfing on the southeast coast. It’s a short walk to Cutters, where they might have the best rum punch on the planet. There’s a note on the wall to mark the time Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin stopped in and Mick Jagger also is a fan. The beaches on the west coast are terrific and there’s a variety of places to stay. Don’t miss the fish fry every Friday night in Oistins, a great place for a filling meal of fresh seafood done up on massive, flaming barbecues and a dose of Caribbean hospitality. \nTip: Up in the hills above Bathsheba, you’ll find my favourite place on the island, Hunte’s Gardens . It’s run by a lovely Englishman who’s built a truly remarkable garden with a grotto and every kind of tropical plant imaginable, not to mention Asian- and Greek-looking statues and a wonderful treehouse-style home that he might invite you to check out. \nST. VINCENT \nThis is an island that doesn’t get a lot of attention, in part because it’s pretty small, doesn’t have amazing beaches and hasn’t had a major airport that could handle direct flights from Canada or the northeast U.S. But they’re building one now and word is it should open in a few months, which would make it much more attractive for snowbirds who wish to avoid connecting flights. You won’t find long stretches of golden sand, but you will find one of the Caribbean’s prettiest islands, with towering peaks and deep valleys and small villages and great hiking. Dark View Falls on the island’s north end takes some time to get to, but it’s a gorgeous setting. The west coast near Walllilabou is known as the setting for the original Pirates of the Caribbean starring Johnny Depp. Some parts of the movie set are still there for tourists to see, along with movie memorabilia and a small restaurant with good food. Beachcombers is a simple but clean hotel with pretty grounds on a nice beach. \nTip: Romantics will love the Young Island Resort , reached by a very short ferry ride from the south end of the island. It’s a nice spot for families as it’s self-contained. \nJAMAICA \nI love the big resorts, including Half Moon , a Rock Resort. It’s got a beautiful, curving beach and calm water to go along with restful, expansive grounds and great food. You can even go horseback riding out in the ocean. Sandals in Ocho Rios does a great job for folks who want a bit more action, as well as good food and a variety of accommodations that range from oceanfront to private villas. Just to the east is the old-style Jamaica Inn, with a fantastic beach and a quiet atmosphere that feels like a welcome throwback to simpler times. Try the Dunn’s River waterfall climb. It’s touristy, but a ton of fun. \nTip: Jake’s at Treasure Beach is a cool spot on the south coast built by the director of the classic reggae/Jamaica movie The Harder They Come . \nST. LUCIA \nThis is a hugely popular island for Canadians and one of the most striking destinations in the Caribbean. The twin towers of rock called The Pitons dominate the southwest coast, a pair of immense rock formations rising hundreds of feet into the sky that give the area a South Seas/Tahiti kind of feel. Sugar Beach, a Viceroy Resort , has a series of beautiful villas spilling down the valley towards a small but marvellous beach with great snorkelling. There’s also one of the Caribbean’s top spas, built in the rainforest. Not far away, and offering tremendous views of the Pitons, is Jade Mountain . It’s owned by a Canadian businessman named Nick Troubetzkoy and features open-air suites with an outside wall missing for optimal views. Each suite has a butler and a sizable infinity pool, as well as useful mosquito netting for around the bed at night. A once-in-a-lifetime splurge if you can handle it. There are more affordable spots further north, including the lovely Cap Maison , Windjammer Landing and a series of Sandals resorts. \nTip: Take a stroll through the Diamond Falls and Botanical Garden near the town of Soufriere. There’s a cool waterfall at one end of the garden where they filmed part of the movie Romancing the Stone . \nU.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS \nI like to think of this set of American islands as three destinations in one. Canadians who’ve been on a Caribbean cruise probably know about St. Thomas, where most of the big ships anchor. It’s a fun and lively island with a couple of beautiful beaches, including Magen’s Bay. The main town of Charlotte Amalie has the usual duty free shops but also some fun alleys with art galleries and one-of-a-kind shops. Hotel 1829 is an affordable spot right in town and has a series of rooms on a hillside overlooking the main bay. Nearby St. John is reached by a short ferry and is the prettiest of the bunch. A large section of the island is national parkland, so there’s great hiking to be found. St. John also is home to Trunk Bay, perhaps the prettiest beach on the planet. The Westin Resort is a great family spot for luxury lovers. Budget travellers should check out Concordia Eco-Resort , where they have glamping units. You also can do work on the grounds in exchange for a room. The town of Christiansted on St. Croix is fun to poke around in and has a great fort that kids will love. The nearby Buccaneer Resort is a beauty set on a bluff above some great beaches. They filmed parts of The Bachelor here a couple years ago. \nTip: Take a snorkel trip to Buck Island for some of the Caribbean’s best underwater viewing. The beach looks like something out of Robinson Crusoe or a South Seas novel. \nANTIGUA \nAnother popular spot for Canadians escaping winter’s chill. You’ll find a stunning coastline with ragged hills and jigsaw-puzzle bays, as well as (they say) a beach for every day of the year. Sugar Ridge is a pretty resort near Jolly Harbour. It’s not on the water but the beach is close by. They also have a great Aveda Spa. Hermitage Bay is a great resort, with gleaming wood interiors and private units with splash pools overlooking a fine beach. The main bar makes a killer Caipirinha. Don’t miss a trip to Shirley Heights, a mountain top lookout near Falmouth Harbour with perhaps the most beautiful view in the Caribbean. \nTip: Try renting a car and touring the island to get a glimpse of country churches, school kids in bright uniforms, gorgeous views of the coast and the simple way of life many folks lead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T17:50:05.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
