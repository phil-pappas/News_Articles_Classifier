(AP) â€” Plans have been unveiled for an art project that will adorn the Nebraska History Museum , which is set to reopen in late February after $8 million in renovation work finishes.\nState funds are paying for the majority of the renovation project, which includes replacement of the 1960s-era building's heating, air conditioning and plumbing. Nebraska law requires that 1 percent of spending for public buildings be used for art, the Lincoln Journal Star ( http://bit.ly/1FbFY87 ) reported.\nThe $46,000 art project, titled \"Inside Out,\" will feature 12 aluminum panels imprinted with images of artifacts within the museum. The panels, each 10-feet-high by 5-feet wide, will be installed on the building's east facade.\n\"It involves bringing greater identity to the outside of the building,\" said John Kay , a principal for Sinclair Hille Architects .\nA committee of artists, art professionals, museum staff, board members and constituents selected Jeanine Centuori and Russell Rock of California-based UrbanRock Design to complete the art project. The designers plan to have museum staff select the artifacts from that will be portrayed on pierced metal scrims suspended on the building.\nThe renovation of the museum also includes upgrades for the Americans with Disabilities Act, including accessible bathrooms.\nThe museum is scheduled to open Feb. 26, 2016.\n___\nInformation from: Lincoln Journal Star, http://www.journalstar.com", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://bit.ly/1FbFY87", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T10:47:17.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
