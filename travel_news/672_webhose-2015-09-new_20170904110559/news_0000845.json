The brand's innovative cab concept, Blue Cab 4, was awarded a gold medal, while its telematics solution PLM™ Connect received an honourable mention from the jury.\nLONDON , Sept. 24, CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE: CNHI / MI: CNHI) agricultural machinery brand New Holland Agriculture, industry leader in grape and olive harvesting and specialist tractors, has come out on top for the SITEVI Innovation Awards. The jury announced its winners ahead of SITEVI 2015, the international equipment and expertise exhibition for wine, olive, fruit and vegetable production, which will take place later this year from 24 – 26 November in Montpellier, France .\nNew Holland's self-propelled grape harvesters received the recognition of the jury, who awarded a gold medal for the Blue Cab 4 and an honourable mention was awarded to the PLM ™ Connect telematics system available on grape harvesters and the T4F/N/V orchard, narrow and vineyard tractor range.\nThe Blue Cab 4 is an innovative cab concept designed around the safety and well-being of the operator. It features the industry's most advanced filtration system. PLM ™ Connect is a telematics solution that enables vineyard managers to be well connected with their operation, allowing them to stay in direct contact with their fleet, receiving real time data on their computer or smartphone. The application of telematics is of increasing value as the wine growing sector consolidates, with fewer vineyard businesses working larger areas, and with the harvesting season getting shorter, the need for efficiency has significantly increased.\n\"We are the world leader in grape and olive harvesting and in specialist tractors, not only because of our established experience in the vineyard industry, but because we are always looking forward, searching for innovative ways of increasing our customers' productivity, making their work easier and safer, all the while guaranteeing the highest quality harvest and gentlest handling of their vines – which are of the utmost importance to them,\" commented Carlo Lambro , Brand President New Holland Agriculture.\nCNH Industrial N.V.
