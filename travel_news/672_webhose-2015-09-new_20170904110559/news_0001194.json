The 22nd Session of the Assembly, the most important global meeting of senior tourism officials and high-level representatives of the private tourism sector, will take place in Chengdu, China, in 2017.\n“China’s importance as a driver of tourism development cannot be understated. It is not only the world’s fourth most visited country, but the number one source market in the world, as well as a prominent leader in domestic tourism, “said UNWTO Secretary-General Taleb Rifai adding, “these numbers, alongside the Chinese authorities continued recognition of tourism as a strategic pillar of the national economy and an effective development tool, make China a fitting host for the next UNWTO General Assembly.”\nAccording to UNWTO data, in 2014, China received 55.6 million international tourism arrivals, generating 56.9 billion US$ in international tourism receipts. In the same year, Chinese tourists spent 164.9 billion US$ abroad, making China a clear leader in terms of international tourism expenditure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:11:41.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
