This week's announcements of record-breaking summer heat and extremely low Arctic sea ice, are stark reminders of the need for us to speed up our response to climate change. \nHotter summers and receding Arctic ice are already causing major changes to ecosystems, species and people â€“ and that is especially true in the North where climate change is happening at a faster rate. One clear example of these changes is the increased presence of killer whales in the Canadian Arctic Ocean. Until recently, killer whales were a rare sight in the Arctic, as their dorsal fins make swimming among heavy sea ice virtually impossible. Today, killer whales are an increasingly regular sight in parts of the Arctic, indicating how climate change is now driving rapid changes to the whole characteristic of northern marine ecosystems. \nIn the face of these ever-increasing, deeply concerning changes, we need strong leadership and bold, firm and effective actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to avoid further risks to people, the Arctic and the entire planet. At this year's UN climate negotiations in Paris we need leaders to come together and agree to take bold action, now.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T04:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T08:02:26.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
