Photo Coutesy of the Waikoloa Beach Marriott Resort & Spa About.com Rating \nIt always worries me to return to a favorite resort after it has changed management. Will everything be as good as or even better than I remember? Such was the case when I returned to the newly renovated Waikoloa Beach Marriott Resort & Spa in the fall of 2008. \nOn our first trip to the Big Island of Hawaii in the early 1990's, we stayed at the resort when it was operated under the Outrigger brand. My wife and I both had very fond memories of our stay. \nI am pleased to tell you that the resort, now managed by Marriott International, is bigger and better than ever. \nMore recently, in February 2015, the resort was purchased by Silverwest Hotel Partners . The new owners plan to keep Marriott as the manager of the hotel. The Rebirth of a Resort \nFor those of you who stayed at the resort prior to its 2007 renovation, I can tell you that most of what you probably enjoyed the most is still there. \nThe basic layout of the hotel will seem very familiar. The lobby is still open-air with great views of the pool area, fishponds and ocean beyond. All of these areas have been dramatically improved. \nThe guest rooms themselves are now some of the most modern and updated in Hawaii. They still, however, retain much of that special island charm. If you select a view with an ocean view, you'll witness some of the best sunsets in Hawaii right from your own lanai. \nThe lobby has the feel of an oceanside resort. Materials and colors bring the feel of the blue sky, blue-green water and golden beach right inside. New seating areas allow plenty of room to just sit and enjoy the views. \nThe Kona Coffee Shoppe provides a great place to purchase a light breakfast or that morning cup of Kona Coffee. \nA new 12,000-square-foot Naupaka Ballroom with its own lovely lawn area doubled the resort’s total indoor meeting space. A new two-level Mandara Spa with seven treatment rooms and a full service salon was added. Room Amenities \nThe Waikoloa Beach Marriott Resort & Spa features six floors with 533 rooms and 22 suites. \nAll guest rooms are wired for high speed Internet access. All public areas offer wireless connectivity. \nGeneral room amenities include air conditioning, alarm clock, flat screen cable TV, safe, coffee maker/tea service, individual climate controls, iron and ironing board, luxurious bedding - down comforters, custom duvets, cotton-rich linens. \nSome rooms include a pull-out sofa bed. Rollaway beds are available. Fine Dining and Plenty of Things to Do and See \nNew is the outdoor Hawaii Calls Restaurant & Lounge. Seating is available close to the pool area as well as a section protected from any inclement weather. My wife and I enjoyed the wonderful breakfast buffet each morning. \nThe pool area has been totally reworked. You can't help but be impressed by the resort's new heated infinity pool. Children and adults alike all seemed to enjoy the new water slide area. \nThe pool deck is huge. It always seems possible to find your own private little space to enjoy the water. \nThe Sunset Luau is offered twice weekly in an area adjacent to the pool deck. The luau has classic Polynesian entertainment including music and traditional dances of the South Pacific. A delectable selection of Hawaiian food is served. Historic Fishponds and Beach \nOne of the highlights of the resort has always been the historic fishpond area that sits between the hotel's pool deck and lawn area and the beach. The stonework has been restored and lighting improved. \nThe area allows guests to become acquainted firsthand with the history and cultural significance of the Big Island's Anaeho'omalu Bay and the King's Trail. \nOnce you make your way to the beach, you'll find one of my favorite beaches in Hawaii where the snorkeling is excellent. \nCatamaran rides, glass bottom boat rides, boogie boards, kayaks and snorkeling equipment area available. A Destination Resort on Hawaii's Big Island \nThe Waikoloa Beach Marriott Resort & Spa is located within the Waikoloa Beach Resort . I was pleased to learn that the various hotels, condominiums and businesses within the resort work together to encourage guests to take full advantage of the offerings of the entire resort \nGuests at the Waikoloa Beach Marriott Resort & Spa can enjoy a round of golf at either the Robert Trent Jones, Jr. Beach Course or the Kings' Course, designed by Tom Weiskopf and Jay Morrish. \nGuests can shop till you drop at the King's Shops or the newer Queens' Marketplace . \nYou can experience a dolphin encounter at the Hilton Waikoloa Village's Dolphin Quest or enjoy lunch or dinner at the Clubhouse, King's Shops, Queens' Marketplace or at one of the Hilton Waikoloa Village’s fine restaurants . \nThis concept of a \"destination resort\" has worked exceptionally well in areas such as the Ka'anapali Resort area on Maui. I'm delighted to see that the members of the Waikoloa Beach Resort have adopted the same concept.
