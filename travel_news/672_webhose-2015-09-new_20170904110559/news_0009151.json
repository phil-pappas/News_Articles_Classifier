(AP) - Attention, leaf peepers: New Hampshire has a new foliage tracker aimed at helping visitors plan their 'peak' fall adventure.\nThe interactive, mobile-friendly tracker from Visit New Hampshire offers regional reports of the state's scenery, lodging and dining suggestions, points of interest and leaf peeper images.\nAbout 8.5 million people are expected to visit New Hampshire this fall, an increase of about 5 percent from last year, travel officials said. Spending from these visitors is expected to be up 7 percent, reaching $1.3 billion.\nThe fall season is historically the second busiest season in the state, attracting more than 25 percent of all visitors to New Hampshire annually.\nMost visitors come from the New England and mid-Atlantic markets. The state is expected to see an increase this fall in overnight visits from more distant states, including Florida, California, Illinois and Texas. Low gas prices are helping the expected increase.\nVisitors are encouraged to share their fall foliage images with New Hampshire's tourism division on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, by using the hashtag #nhfoliage.\n___\nOnline:\nhttp://www.visitnh.gov", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T17:28:42.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
