The system consists of power sources (batteries and generators), components (control devices, conversion devices, and protection devices), and power distribution systems (busbar systems, and wires and cables). Motors, lighting systems, heating systems, and avionics are the primary electrical loads in an aircraft. Meanwhile, ECS is vital for maintaining a safe and comfortable environment in the cabin of an aircraft. The main functions of ECS are maintaining optimal cabin pressure, supplying oxygen, and maintaining a comfortable level of humidity and temperature. It also maintains the circulation of air in cabins, replacing it every two to three minutes.\nTechnavio's analysts forecast the global commercial aircraft electrical and environmental systems market to grow at a CAGR of 6.43% over the period 2014-2019.\nCovered in this Report\nThis report covers the current scenario and growth prospects of the global commercial aircraft electrical and environmental systems market for the period 2015-2019.
