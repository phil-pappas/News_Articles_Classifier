Audits of member airlines are performed to ensure requirements are being fulfilled. \nSkyTeam Benefits Benefits of flying on SkyTeam airline alliance partners include the organization's Inter-Airline Through Check-in. The Inter-Airline Through Check-in lets an agent from any SkyTeam airline assign seats and issue boarding passes for a traveler's connections on other alliance airlines. Perhaps even more important for business travelers, if you're a SkyTeam Elite Plus member, you are actually guaranteed a seat (economy class) or reservation on any SkyTeam long-haul flight, even if that flight is sold out! In order to take advantage of that perk, you need to call the airline 24 hours in advance.
