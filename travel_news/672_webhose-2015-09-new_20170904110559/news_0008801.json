Anyway, this giant-sized arcade toy will be a part of the Sandbox of Human Ingenuity. The 30-foot-high game will require a little more skill than usual—you’ll have to collaborate if you want to win. Where: Station B, Fort Calgary When: Sept. 17 - 20 If you have a little bit of rage you need to work off, the Catharsis Catapult Comp is the place to be. Teams will design and build catapults to launch their “love-to-hate” items into the air. The team that hits the furthest target wins! If you think this sounds like fun, you can start prepping a team for next year—and prepping those items to destroy. Where: Fort Calgary When: Sept. 15, 1:00 - 4:00 p.m. Modernist cuisine and Beakerhead go together like apple pie and cheddar cheese (weird, but good). Food and cocktails will be combined in a lab - each floor of the Barron Building will hold a different experience/experiment for your tastebuds.

Bear with us. On Stephen Avenue, there will be a dog orchestra. No, these dogs can’t play the instruments—they are the instruments. Each time you pet these local pooches’ fur, it will complete a circuit and a note will play. Where: Stephen Avenue Walk, Between Centre and 3 St. SW When: Sept. 17, 4:00 - 6:00 p.m. Calgary’s historic first skyscraper, the Barron Building (formerly home to the Uptown and Marquee Room) will be coming to life as part of A String (Theory) Of Incredible Encounters, an interwoven string of public, interactive artworks that will be on display around the city. One of the highlights at the building is Nanoleaf, an installation by Calgary-based internationally renowned artists Caitlind r.c. Brown and Wayne Garrett. Where: Barron Building When: Sept. 20, 10:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. The Girls Learning Code workshops were created to help young women see technology in a whole new light. This special edition will do that literally—with MakeFashion designer Katheryn Blair available to teach girls ages 8-13 how to make their own wearable, glowing, tech. Their creations will be debuted at Beakernight, the festival’s pinnacle free, outdoor spectacle. Where: The Commons When: Sept. 19, 10:00 a.m. - 3:00 p.m. Journey through the looking glass with these white rabbits from Australian artist Amanda Parer.
