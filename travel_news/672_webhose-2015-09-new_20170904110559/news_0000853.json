It is home to 70 breweries, according to Finger Lakes Beer Trail , a local trade group, up from just 24 in 2011. Twelve more are scheduled to open in the next few months.\nLyonSmith Brewing Co. in Penn Yan opened its doors in April, while Seneca Lake Brewing Co. in Rock Stream is set to open its tasting room soon. Both focus exclusively on British styles.\n“Our region’s craft brews are unique from other areas of the U.S. in that our breweries are very fortunate to have access to fresh, clean water; locally grown hops; malted barley; and other ingredients,” Theresa Hollister, a founding partner of the Finger Lakes Beer Trail, wrote in an email.\nIn Transit Travel news, deals and tips, written by the editors and reporters of the Travel section.
