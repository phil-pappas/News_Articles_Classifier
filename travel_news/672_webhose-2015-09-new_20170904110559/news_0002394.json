I had no job lined up. Nowhere to live. There was nothing to fall back on,” says Beverley Reinemann, a gap-year student who used her experience to build a career in online marketing.\n“If you do it right, a gap year can give you the extra skills you need to outshine other candidates when you return home,” she adds.\nAround 2.5 million students embark on a gap year each year, with most young Britons using this time to volunteer for charities overseas. To boost your CV, it can also be helpful to combine volunteering with internships and part-time roles.\n“One of the gap year’s most undervalued advantages is the ability to undertake work placements outside of the over-subscribed holiday periods,” says gap-year student Katherine Hodgson. “My part-time job also funds the volunteering and keeps me, and my CV, busy.”\nTaking a year out can also give you valuable time to consider different career paths. “It can give you a taste of different sectors and work environments, allowing you to find out what you like and don’t like in a workplace,” she adds.\nSo, if you’re looking to make the most of a year out from work or study, join us on Thursday 10 September from 1pm-3pm BST for a live chat with the experts.
