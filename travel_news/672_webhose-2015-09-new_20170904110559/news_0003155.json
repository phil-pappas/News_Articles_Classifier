The original new features of the new releases include 3D Touch, a new-and-improved 12-megapixel back camera with 4K video plus a 5 megapixel front camera, and the ability to create automatic GIF-like images from photos. 3D Touch is essentially an advanced version of Force Touch , which has already been rolled out on the Apple Watch and MacBook and MacBook Pro lines. This means the new iPhones will recognise pressure as a new gesture. Pressing down quickly will let you \"peek\" at content that you're hovering on, while pressing for longer will make it pop up, wihtout leaving the app. This could be useful to look at detailed flight information by pressing down on a flight number, or getting location information by pressing down on a point on the map. The 12-megapixel camera is a big jump up from the predecessors' 8 megapixels, with better Autofocus and colour accuracy. A new default feature called Live Photos will automatically make little gifs of all your photos, with sound too. All you need to do is take a regular photo. Apple also joins rival phone-makers in including 4K video recording. The new iPhone6s and iPhone 6s Plus will both be made from a new custom alumium alloy called Series 7000, which is used by the aerospace industry.
