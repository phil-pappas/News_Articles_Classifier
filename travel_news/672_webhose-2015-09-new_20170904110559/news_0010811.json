The launch of the low-cost carrier’s London flight schedule for next year also sees extra flights on 20 existing routes, including services to Edinburgh, Glasgow and Berlin from Stansted, to Copenhagen from Luton, and from Gatwick to Dublin. • 36 hours in Sofia The exact start dates of the airline's new routes and additional services vary, but are mostly in late March and early April 2016 and the Stansted-Milan Malpensa route in December this year. • Ryanair hand luggage rules explained The Vilnius flights will run from Luton airport, while Milan Malpensa, Sofia and Verona will be accessed from Ryanair's base airport, Stansted. The capital of Lithuania, Vilnius, is a good value city break destination (AP) The new Stansted-Verona route will likely appeal to travellers wishing to see the settings for many of Shakespeare’s plays, or for those wishing to economise on flights and put the savings towards a hotel stay on the notoriously expensive Lake Garda, less than an hour’s drive away. • The truth about Ryanair's customer service department The new services to Sofia and Vilnius will make the good value city break destinations more accessible for travellers on a budget. Vilnius is already served from London airports by Wizz Air, AirBaltic, and the Polish airline LOT, while British Airways, easyJet and Wizz Air operate flights to Sofia. The new routes will mean Ryanair operates 150 routes from London (Ryanair) Photo: Ryanair Ryanair, which has been attempting to improve its image over the past year, by overhauling its website , allowing passengers to bring on a second piece of hand luggage, and introducing allocated seating, now offers flights on 150 routes from Gatwick, Stansted and Luton. • In pictures: what has changed about Ryanair? As the next stage of its attempt to improve service, Ryanair’s chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, said that the low-cost airline would be introducing a “personalised” website, including a “hold the fare” function. He added that from December this year passengers could expect to see new crew uniforms and “improved inflight menus” and new cabin interiors .
