That means more creative industries, more services, hi-tech research and development. It will also be a more urbanised future. In fact, projections suggest that, on current trends, by 2050, 89 per cent of us will be living in cities, up from 82 per cent today. That means an extra 14 million people, more than the combined populations of Greater London and Greater Manchester today. That is important because living in the city helps people be more creative. It is much easier to invent things, share problems and seek solutions collaboratively when you have got easy access to other skilled people. We cannot continue to patch and mend our existing infrastructure It is the reason that, despite the digital revolution of the past decade and even though we now have more methods of instant communication at our fingertips than ever, people still value face-to-face meetings and passenger demand continues to grow. Despite Twitter, Facebook, Skype and all the rest, people keep flocking to the city. The problem is that this process, of increasing urbanism and the move to a knowledge-based economy, is increasingly benefiting some cities over others – partly because high-skilled workers are more likely to move in search of work. And increasingly, when they move, they move to London. Working in a dynamic labour market, they build skills and networks faster than their compatriots in other cities. In turn, businesses come, attracted by the skills, and the circle repeats. This concentration of business, finance and commerce in London and the South East has had undeniable benefits for the people of London and the UK as a whole – and will continue to do so. The problem is that the gap between London and the rest is increasingly becoming counterproductive, both for London itself and the rest of the country. The contrast in productivity is stark. In London, labour productivity is 50 per cent higher than in the North. For Londoners it is translating into an ever-increasing cost of living. For business it means paying higher wages just to keep up with the cost of living – and especially housing. Dealing with the problem will be hard but the prize is immense. Treasury analysis shows that realising the ambition to rebalance the UK economy would be worth an additional £56 billion in nominal terms to the northern economy, or £44 billion in real terms, equal to £1,600 per individual in the North. That is why HS2 is so important. The first phase, from London to Birmingham, will dramatically improve capacity, tripling the number of seats from Euston and providing much needed space for intercity travel to continue to grow. By providing significantly faster, more reliable connections between London and the major cities of the North, HS2 will help to level the playing field and make the North a more attractive place to do business. Birmingham, for example, would be about half an hour closer to London, but also a solid hour closer to Leeds. Journeys that used to take more than two hours, like London-Manchester, will be brought down to just over one hour. Of course, HS2 is no silver bullet. But the dramatically improved capacity and connectivity it will provide will be a powerful catalyst for our cities and regions to capitalise on. Business clearly wants it to happen. This year HSBC announced plans to move its retail banking HQ from London to Birmingham, citing HS2 as one of the key reasons it chose the city. For HSBC it makes business sense – closer to its nationwide chain of high street banks, and cheaper all round, for it and its employees. Other towns and cities will also benefit. From day one, HS2 will be integrated with the existing network to allow services to reach destinations north of Birmingham such as Stoke-on-Trent, Liverpool, Manchester, north Wales, Preston, Carlisle and onward to Glasgow and Edinburgh. Similar to the way that the first motorways took long-distance traffic off local roads, the first phase of HS2 will take pressure off the existing West Coast Main Line and free up much needed space for freight and extra local services to places such as Milton Keynes, Northampton and Rugby. In effect, returning use of the West Coast Main Line to the communities that live along it. This is important because HS2 is not a replacement for the existing rail network. It is an extension, a supplement and a support. We need it because we cannot continue to squeeze extra capacity out of our existing infrastructure by patching and mending. Over the past 20 years the number of people travelling by train has doubled, and it continues to grow at around 5 per cent a year. Faced with that sort of growth, we need to think big and plan for the future. A future where more people live in cities. A future where their sustainable growth will be more and more important, and where people will demand faster, more reliable intercity transport. That is what HS2 is all about. What is HS2? • The first phase will connect London Euston with a new station at Birmingham Curzon Street, next to the Bullring and existing Moor Street station. Work is scheduled to start in 2017, with the first services running in 2026. • A second phase, due to open by 2033, will continue north with one leg linking Birmingham with Leeds, via the East Midlands and Sheffield, while another leg will link Birmingham with Manchester via Crewe. • New stations at Old Oak Common in west London and Birmingham airport will help unlock new areas for jobs and housing as well as local and international connections. • For more information visit www.gov.uk/hs2 • This article was originally produced and published by Business Reporter.
