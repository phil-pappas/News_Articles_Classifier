(AP) - Leaders in Norwich have penned a letter supporting the rebuilding of dam destroyed by Tropical Storm Irene after a back-and-forth with state officials who oppose its construction.\nThe Valley News reports the Norwich Select Board voted unanimously this week to send a letter to the Agency of Natural Resources supporting the rebuilding of the Norwich Pool Dam. Town leaders submitted their application to restore the swimming hole last month.\nA draft of the letter written by Selectman Christopher Ashley says the community treasured the pool.\nOfficials say the town has already spent more than $70,000 on lawyers, engineers and biologists helping to move the case forward.\nThe town is facing a November 2016 deadline in order to use FEMA funding to construct the dam.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
