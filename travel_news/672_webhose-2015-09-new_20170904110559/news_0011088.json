Players can also take advantage of the latest state-of-the-art TaylorMade equipment when they hire clubs at the resort after a significant recent upgrade of its rental service. Prices start from €55 (approx £40) for a two-round package.\nVerdura, also a member of Leading Hotels of the World, has won widespread recognition across the luxury\nglobal travel industry since opening in 2009 with honours including a ‘Golden Award for Golf‘ at the 2015 Voyages & Hôtels Readers Awards and being named ‘Best Family European Golf Resort‘ by the 2011 Tatler Travel Guide.\nSituated on Sicily’s southern coast between Agrigento and the fishing city of Sciacca, an 80-minute drive from Trapani and Palermo airports, the resort features 203 rooms and suites – all with a sea view. Away from the fairways, guests can enjoy numerous other sports and leisure facilities including six tennis courts, a 60m two-tiered infinity pool, a 170sqm fully-equipped gym and an award-winning 4,000sqm spa complex.\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T18:10:33.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
