Friends who love the island town so much they’ve relocated there generously introduce us to their favorite places to eat and drink. Here’s a look at our top gustatory finds on recent trips to the old Victorian city by the gulf.\nOcean Grille and Beach Bar Newest on the seawall, this very contemporary bistro snagged us with its open-air patio looking out over the waves. It made the perfect afternoon time-out during a bicycle ride around the island, and its modern, stone-and-wood interior makes it one of the prettier places to enjoy dinner, too. A cold pint of St. Arnold’s Elissa and Mediterranean flatbread hit the spot, but we’ll be back to try charred octopus and Vietnamese pork riblets.\nContact: Open daily. 1228 Seawall Blvd., Galveston; 409-974-4508, oceangrilleandbeachbar.com\nPorch Cafe Tucked into Beachtown, a new Cape Cod-esque resort-residential development at Galveston Island’s far east end, this bistro exudes beach chic. Starters and small plates won us over, from the Gulf white ceviche, plump with shrimp, snapper and avocado; to watermelon-shrimp salad with feta; and fried green tomatoes with goat cheese. The fried shrimp po’boy bore a perfect remoulade, while the Wagyu burger topped with blue cheese made me swoon. The wine list, abundant with good French choices, impresses.\nContact: Closed Monday through Wednesday. 1625 E. Beach Drive, Galveston; 409-762-0808, porchcafe.com\nFarley Girls Cafe This sunny charmer near the island’s medical school gets an A-plus for its breakfast and brunch, and not just because the Hangover Helper Bowl is one of the best things we’ve ever tasted. Run by sisters who went to culinary school, the sensational morning meals include huevos rancheros that come with black beans and avocado, and eggs (we like them over-easy) atop a pool of Gouda-infused shrimp and grits. Mimosas complete the experience.\nContact: Open daily. 801 Post Office St., Galveston; 409-497-4454 or farleygirls.com\nGaido’s Little has changed at this stalwart on the Seawall in 100-plus years, but the brunch was a happy revelation for us. We delighted in the serve-yourself bloody Mary bar, stocked with more than a dozen condiments, including pickled asparagus and green beans. Goat cheese beignets pair with the bloodies rather well, and the crawfish hash — a plate of skillet fries lavished with saffron crawfish fondue and hollandaise filled with Texas jumbo lump crab — stole the show. That said, I still can’t resist Cy’s Demise, a platter of oysters on the half-shell, buttery, charcoal-grilled and sprinkled with shredded parmesan.\nContact: Open daily. 3828 Seawall Blvd., Galveston; 409-761-5500, gaidos.com\nMaceo Spice & Import Co. Opened in the 1940s by descendants of an early Italian immigrant family settling on Galveston Island, the bulk spice company brings in a large and loyal following to its retail shop and lunch room. We readily recognized the Maceo family’s ties to New Orleans the moment we bit into the muffaletta, a sandwich we found easily as good as those at Central Grocery in NOLA. Lunch specials also include lush stuffed peppers and Italian sausage with pork gravy. We brought a cooler so we could take home the cut-to-order soppressata, mortadella and capicola, and an extra shopping bag we filled with giant spice bottles and tins of Sicilian olive oil.\nContact: Closed Monday. 2706 Market St., Galveston; 409-763-3331, maceospice.com\nJune Naylor is a Fort Worth freelance writer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-13T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T03:49:45.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
