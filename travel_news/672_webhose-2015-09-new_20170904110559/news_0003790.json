You may bridle when a shop assistant calls you “dear”, but I don’t mind a jot when someone I don’t know from Adam (or Eve) acknowledges me as “mate” or “guv”. Granted, it must be difficult for a retired major-general or hospital matron to be referred to in such an intimate fashion, but surely what matters is the amiability of one’s interlocutor who is, after all, trying only to be pleasant. It seems to me to say much more about the recipient of such a form of address if they take it as an insult and an affront to their dignity. Such terms vary according to geography. In Derby, you are likely to be referred to as “me duck” and in the West Country as “my lover”. In neither instance does the person using such terms mean anything more by them than a friendly verbal handshake. They are part of local custom and slip into conversation almost without thinking. David Cameron came under fire in 2011 when he said \"calm down dear\" to Harriet Harman Photo: AP I know this only too well since, as a Yorkshireman, I have a habit of referring to those I know and also, I confess, those with whom I am not particularly well acquainted, as “love”. I use the term good-naturedly – to both men and women – and can only hope that they are taken in the same spirit as they are given. There are times, of course, when such familiarity is highly inappropriate. I have never addressed the Queen or another member of the Royal family as “love”. Nor a Prime Minister . But I suspect there are others of rank who have, in conversation, been so addressed and I have not noticed them bat an eye. I hope they make allowances for my local patois and do not assume that I am regarding them as some inferior minion, or that I am claiming a closer affinity than I deserve. Lord Attenborough addressed almost everyone he knew as “darling” because he said he was hopeless at remembering names. His habit became a trademark and endeared him to all and sundry. Perhaps if our politicians referred to each other as “love” or “darling”, then they might get along rather better. It’s an interesting thought. @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T11:00:14.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
