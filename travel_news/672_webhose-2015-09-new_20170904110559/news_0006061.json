Tourism Northern Ireland prepared the group’s itinerary which highlights the facilities and accommodation on offer in Northern Ireland, as well as the great experiences business delegates can enjoy here on the sidelines of their conference or meeting.\n \nDuring their time in Fermanagh, the business tourism buyers took a boat trip to Lough Erne Resort, where they had the opportunity to dine with executive chef Noel McMeel, who told them all about the high quality of Northern Ireland’s food and why 2016 has been designated Northern Ireland’s Year of Food and Drink. The next day, the group visited Castle Coole, Orchard Acre Farm and Hillsborough Castle, before taking part in a cookery class at the Belfast Cookery School. They enjoyed a visit to our latest tourism experience, The Gobbins Coastal Path, before continuing to Titanic Belfast and then to Montalto Estate for a private dinner. They also dropped by Castle Ward, where they took part in an archery lesson during a Game of Thrones-themed visit.\n \nZoë Redmond, Tourism Ireland’s manager for Central Europe, said: “We are delighted that these influential business tourism buyers have taken the time to visit Fermanagh and Northern Ireland, to experience for themselves some of the superb facilities on offer here. Seeing, and tasting, is believing – so fact-finding visits like this are extremely important to help build awareness of the destination and our world-class business tourism offering among key influencers in Germany.\n \n“Business tourism is an important, high yield sector and Tourism Ireland is working hard to continue to raise awareness of Northern Ireland as a world-class conference and business tourism destination. Our activity involves working closely with German MICE buyers and providing effective platforms for our Northern Ireland industry partners to ‘close the sale’. We are highlighting the excellent meetings, incentive and transport infrastructure on offer in Fermanagh and Northern Ireland – and particularly showcasing our excellent food and drink in the run-up to next year’s special year.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T18:35:51.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
