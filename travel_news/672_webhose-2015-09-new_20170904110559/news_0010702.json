We compare the cost of flights, Eurostar, car, and Megabus, and Eurolines coach tickets Amsterdam: always lovely, but what's the cheapest way to get there? Photo: AP Comments \nAmsterdam , the capital of the Netherlands, with its coffee shops, canals, bicycles - and various other clichés - is always going to be a popular city break destination. But what is the cheapest way to get there from London? We’ve compared the various travel options by car, train, ferry, coach and aeroplane. Methodology \nThe snapshot of prices below was researched on Thursday September 3 for departures on three dates: the following day (September 4 2015), one week in advance (for travel on Thursday, September 10), and three months in advance (for travel on Thursday, November 26). \nPrices checked are for a single adult, with no discount cards, for a return journey, with the inbound leg four days after the outbound trip. Airfares are hand-luggage only. \n• Where to stay for under £100 in Amsterdam: review of Hotel Vondel \nFor the cheapest airfares, we have not included the cost of travel to the airport, or from the airport to Amsterdam city centre. But the cheapest we found for the latter was €4.75 (for a single ticket into Amsterdam city centre on bus 197 from Amsterdam Schiphol airport - bus197.nl ), while the cheapest direct train to Gatwick from central London is at least £10 (from St Pancras, journey time approximately 50 minutes, see nationalrail.co.uk for details). \nCheapest return fare: travelling the following day Cheapest return fare: one week in advance Cheapest return fare: three months in advance Coach (Eurolines; from Victoria Coach Station) £43 £34.50 Unavailable that far in advance. But a return journey departing October 29 and returning November 1 (the farthest in advance we could search) costs £60 Coach (Megabus) A return journey departing November 28 and returning December 2 costs £20. By plane (easyJet from Gatwick) £149.98 By ferry (Stenaline “rail and sail” package, foot passengers, from Liverpool St) £127 By train (Eurostar and Thalys) £175 (+£4 fee if paying by credit card) £175 (+£4 fee if paying by credit card) A return journey departing November 28 and returning December 2 costs £110.50 (+£4 fee if paying by credit card) \n*The route by car includes Eurotunnel crossing and petrol costs based on the calculations provided by viamichelin.co.uk , and assuming that travellers take the quickest route (331 miles, taking 6 hours 25 minutes) and travel in a petrol hatchback with a fuel cost of £1.60 per litre. It assumes a car measuring less than 1.85m in height, without a roofbox or bikes attached and without a trailer or caravan. The route assumes travel from central London (Parliament Square, SW1P 3BD) to central Amsterdam (Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal). \n• The best cheap restaurants in Amsterdam Top tips \nSee viamichelin.co.uk for a very comprehensive guide to driving on the continent. It allows users to create routes and itineraries for cars, motorbikes, bicycles and pedestrians between specific addresses, allowing searches that favour motorways, and avoid tolls and/or off-road connections such as ferries and trains. You can also get a more realistic idea of petrol costs by specifying vehicle and fuel type. \nFor Channel crossings, the cheapest Eurotunnel fares were almost all between midnight and 6am. “Short Stay saver” fares - cheaper than standard tickets - are available for trips where the inward leg is within five days of outward travel, so are suited to city breaks. \n• Amsterdam city guide \nIt’s also worth bearing in mind that there are many flights to Amsterdam from regional airports, including Newcastle and Cardiff, served by KLM, and Inverness and Birmingham, served by Flybe. There are returns available from between £100 and £200 from such airports for the dates we spot checked – and sometimes much less: there was a £49 return flight with easyJet from London Southend to Amsterdam for the December dates we checked, on skyscanner.net . So if you are travelling from the regions, rather than London, then do not dismiss flying. \n• The cheapest way from London to Paris \nIt is also worth taking into account the extra time taken with ferry travel, which may eat into your break unless you opt for an overnight crossing. For example, the £57 Stenaline package as above leaves at 9am on Thursday December 3 and does not get passengers into Amsterdam until 5.15 pm. Flights, on the other hand, are the quickest form of transport: the easyJet plane leaves at 8.05am and gets in at 10.25 am – leaving you a whole day extra to explore the capital of the Netherlands. If you were desperate to take the ferry, you would be better off leaving the UK on the previous evening (11pm sailing on Wednesday December 2) and paying an extra £30 for a cabin on the overnight crossing, arriving in the Netherlands at 8am on the Thursday morning. \nTo save a few pounds, compare across several coach companies: in our spot check for booking travel for the next day, Euroline’s fare was cheapest by nearly £15.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:08:55.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
