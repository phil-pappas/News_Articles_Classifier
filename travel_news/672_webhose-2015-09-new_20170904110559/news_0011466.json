The re-developed simulation facility (set to officially open in October 2015) is based in Horley on the borders of Surrey and Sussex, and will aptly be renamed as Lets Race & Lets Golf becoming one of the top simulation destination venues in the UK. \nThe company will not only enhance their race experience offering with the installation of RFactor2 technology in their renowned 10 networked full-motion F1 Sims, but will now also provide hour-long sessions in one of their three new HD Golf simulation booths - offering golf enthusiasts the chance to play virtually on some of the best courses in the world from St. Andrews to the PGA National. Proving that simulation can help enhance players’ technique, thanks to their video analysis and pressure plate technology, the centre is also welcoming golf pro Steve Furlonger to their team. Steve will be on hand three times a week to offer one to one or group coaching sessions. Furthermore, Lets Golf will also feature a Callaway retail zone providing custom fitted clubs for customers. If that wasn’t enough to whet every sports fanatic’s appetite, Lets Race & Lets Golf will also see the family-run restaurant chain, Blacks Burgers, open within the centre. Using only the freshest produce available, the restaurant will offer an amazing range of home-made burgers with all the trimmings as well as a whole host of other mouth-watering treats. Ben Stephenson, Commercial Manager for Lets Race & Lets Golf, commented: “We are delighted to be expanding the company to include Lets Golf and Blacks Burgers. ￼ Since opening three years ago we have seen the business flourish as more and more people understand the benefits of simulation within sport, and moving into the golf industry seemed like the perfect next step. Our goal is to offer the most realistic simulation experience possible for our customers both on the green and the grid and I am excited to welcome a new genre into the building. “Thanks to the centre’s new food offering from Blacks Burgers, it enables us to cater for every market from everyday visitors to corporate events, stag and hen dos and even professional team hire.” Sessions for Lets Golf will start from £15 and groups of up to six people can hire each booth at any one time. Race experiences for Lets Race also start at £15.
