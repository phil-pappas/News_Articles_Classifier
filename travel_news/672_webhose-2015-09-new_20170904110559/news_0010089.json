To help consumers uncover the very best deals, priceline.com, a leader in online and mobile travel and part of The Priceline Group, has compiled the best days to fly and corresponding tips for this upcoming holiday season.\n“Overall, holiday airfares are trending down from last year,” said priceline.com’s Travel Analyst Brian Ek. “However, fare trends can shift at any time, so travelers looking for reasonable airfare should book as soon as possible, and be sure to check out more than one set of desired travel dates to see if travel flexibility can result in a lower priced ticket.”\nThanksgiving falls on Nov. 26 this year. Travelers booking now will find the best fares if they depart on Nov. 19, 20, 23, 24 and 26; and return home on Nov. 26 or 27, or wait until Dec. 1. Travelers will pay higher fares if they depart the weekend before the holiday (Nov. 21 and 22), the day before Thanksgiving (Nov. 25th, which is traditionally the most expensive and most crowded day to fly); and return any day between Nov. 28 and 30.\nTo illustrate how much fares can change depending on travel dates, priceline.com looked at current fares for a New York to Tampa roundtrip itinerary. The fares for a Nov. 19-27 itinerary ranged from $290-$333. For a Nov. 24-Dec. 1 itinerary, fares ranged from $333-$373. Flying on peak days – Nov. 25 and 29 – significantly increases the fare range to $628-$670.\nMeanwhile, Christmas, falls on a Friday this year. Flights are likely to be more expensive and crowded the weekend before the holiday (Dec. 19 and 20), Dec. 23, and the weekend after Christmas (Dec. 26 and 27). The best days to depart will likely be Dec. 21, 22 and 24, and the best days to return are Christmas Day itself and anytime between Dec. 28 and 31.\nUsing the same New York to Tampa roundtrip itinerary, priceline.com looked at currently available fares and found that the fare for a Dec. 21-29 itinerary ranged from $341-$682. For a Dec. 24-29 itinerary, fares ranged from $427-$639. And for a Dec. 23-27 itinerary, fares rose to $483-$720.\nEk also shared some additional tips to find cheaper airfare and keep travel costs in check:\nPick times of the day that are normally less busy . Keep in mind the time of day that you’ll be flying. Travelers will find the most affordable seats departing early in the morning (5 to 7 a.m.) or late evening (after 8 p.m.). Mid-day (11 a.m. to 4 p.m.) is a bit more expensive, but still reasonable. Most expensive are the peak business travel hours (8 to 10 a.m. and 5 to 7 p.m.).\nTry priceline.com’s Name Your Own Price airline tickets service .
