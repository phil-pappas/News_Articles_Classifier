To minimise such challenges, Randall said hotels must help by providing a single point of contact for event planners. \n\n“Hotels in this region must also help to market the destination by educating clients on what’s available besides the hotel and its meeting facilities. I have ballrooms in my hotel, but so does the hotel next door. We guide our clients around the destination and show them how a meeting in the city like Bangkok could work with a post-event programme in a resort destination like Hua Hin,” she said. \n\nWhat destinations in South-east Asia have going for them is the availability of convenient air links within the region, said the panellists. While destinations in the region are connected by a multitude of low-cost carriers, Pornthip said these are not options favoured by incentive winners. Instead, full-service regional carriers are preferred. \n\n“That’s why boutique carrier Bangkok Airways has been able to do so well with (business travellers),” said Randall, pointing to its good ASEAN connections and brand positioning. \n\nCommenting on the panellists’ views, Ally Lai, managing director of i Life China which specialises in incentive travel, told TTGAsia e-Daily that destinations in the region that are connected to one another by convenient transportation are favoured. \n\nShe also found that “combining destinations in the ASEAN region is possible when a group has fewer than 100 pax”. \n\nRead more reports from the ground in our IT&CMA and CTW Asia-Pacific 2015 Show Dailies .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T09:58:26.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
