This all night event exclusively for women and in aid of Macmillian Cancer Trust and Breast Cancer Now charities, offers something for everyone, with book readings added to cocktail mixing classes, yoga, film screenings and much more. \nHaley Hill will be reading from her debut novel It’s Got to be Perfect , which draws on first hand stories she encountered after a dramatic career change in her mid-twenties. Haley went from working in the pharmaceutical industry to becoming the founder of the Elect Club dating agency, the UK’s leading matchmaking agency. Anecdotes resulting from that time resulted in this cracking novel, which reached both No. 1 in the Amazon Humour and the Hot New Releases charts. Amanda Prowse is a bestselling novelist and short story writer. Her latest works include A Mother’s Story and Perfect Daughter. Her many successes include being Writer in Residence on ITV’s This Morning, achieving wide fame with her debut novel Poppy Day and reaching 130K followers on Twitter. Anna Golden, Commercial Director at Olympia London, said: “Everyone enjoys a book before bed, so we’re delighted to welcome these two brilliant authors to our first ever, industry sleepover at Olympia London. As an event honouring the achievements of women in events, it will be great to learn how these two ladies have achieved success in the competitive world of fiction writing - as well as hear some great stories!” Tickets cost £30 with proceeds to Macmillian Cancer Trust and Breast Cancer Now.
