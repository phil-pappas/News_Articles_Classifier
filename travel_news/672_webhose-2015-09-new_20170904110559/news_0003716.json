All of this is on the back of the brilliant new station, which opened last weekend.\n“There will be hundreds of thousands of visitors to the city centre and we want everyone to arrive on time and be able to get home safely. Our advice is simple – have a great time but please plan your travel, following our three tips: allow extra time, prepare for it to be busy and know your last three trains.”\nOn visiting Rugby World Cup fans, Liam added: “Many of the fans travelling to these games will be first-time visitors to Birmingham so won’t be familiar with our transport systems and some won’t speak English as their first language. Our job is to help give them a great first impression of our city and to ensure they get safely to and from the games.”\nLondon Midland’s head of West Coast services, Terry Oliver, said: “Our message is it will be busy, there are other events going on as well, so plan ahead and don’t leave it till the last train or you may be disappointed. This is Birmingham’s bumper weekend with the arts festival, Grand Central and the Rugby World Cup all in full swing. We are also reminding fans travelling to Villa Park to use Aston station. Additional services will run before and after the games.”\nSource:- Network Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T15:33:56.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
