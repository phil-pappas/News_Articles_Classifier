The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) requested a ground stop for all traffic in and out of Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW), Chicago Oâ€™Hare (ORD) and Miami (MIA) due to technical problems with their computer system.\nThe flights were suspended for two hours after which the problems were resolved. The airlines apologized to passengers for the inconvenience as many airports including the O-Hare was closed down. The problem with computers started off at 11am, though the real issue was not known but the crew was working on correcting the problem.\nAt this point the American Airlines and the US Airways are planning to combine their companies under one banner and such a glitch at this crucial time may put the airlines in a bad picture. The US Airways brand will be gradually removed as it will combine under the banner of American Airline.\nProblems usually crop up when systems are combined. It had happened before with United Airlines which faced a computer outrage in 2010 when it merged with Continental Airlines.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:08:48.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
