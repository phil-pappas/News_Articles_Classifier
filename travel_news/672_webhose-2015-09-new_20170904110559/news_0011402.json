The Bureau is also reiterating that from August – October 2015, there have been no cancellations of MICE events and assuring that all key events are still on track. \nMr Nopparat Maythaveekulchai, TCEB’s President, revealed that “TCEB has prepared six immediate measures to provide assistance and maintaining confidence among organisers of TCEB-supported MICE events in Thailand as well as among MICE travellers attending events in Thailand during August – October 2015, including : Measure1 : The measure to provide support on the MICE Lane service to facilitate MICE Travellers from the plane to Immigration checkpoint at Suvannabhumi Airport. Organisers of MICE events in Thailand who wish to receive the support under this measure can make a request for events that are officially supported by TCEB only. Measure2 : The measure to provide information and assistance services at TCEB Counter at Suvannabhumi Airport. TCEB Counter, located at the Conveyer Belt 18, Arrival Hall, provides information as well as address questions from MICE travellers 24 hours, covering from updates on the industry or others, such as, contacting the Tourist Police, associations or related government agencies. Measure3 : The measure to provide regular communication on the current situation to keep the market up to date and to maintain confidence among MICE organisers. TCEB will issue statement and provide up-to-date information on the current situation on request by MICE organisers of TCEB-supported events. Measure4 : The measure to provide special police escort support for MICE travellers travelling in large groups and for VIPs with the emphasis on providing safety and smooth experience for transferring between the airport and hotel. MICE organisers can make a request for expenses support for events with minimum 200 delegates per group or attended by VIPs. The support is at maximum 5,000 baht per time and for events that TCEB supports only. Measure5 : The measure to provide security support for high-level executives or VIPs. MICE Organisers can make a request for expense support on hiring security personnel per the number of MICE travellers at a ratio of 2 security persons per 100 business travellers. The support package for security personnel is at maximum 1,500 baht per person per day and for events that TCEB supports only. Measure6 : The measure to provide extra security support. Organisers can make a request for additional security as urgent and necessary by submitting their demand to TCEB for approval and for events that TCEB supports only. “During August to October 2015, the number of MICE events confirmed to be held in Thailand is totalled at 72 events with 76,608 delegates, generating revenue of 6,600 million baht. There is no cancellation or postponement of events scheduled to be held in Thailand during this time. TCEB is confident that our ability to facilitate and maintain confidence among MICE organisers and travellers will help us keep all MICE events on track,” Mr Nopparat concluded. Thailand’s MICE industry performance in the first three quarters of the 2015 fiscal year showed satisfactory results due to positive growth in the number of MICE visitors and revenue when compared to the same period in the previous year. Thailand welcomed a total of 726,280 high quality business events travellers (7.84% growth), generating 63,714 million baht (up 8.69%) in the first three quarters of the 2015 fiscal year. The top contributors during this period were China, Singapore, India, Malaysia, USA, Laos, Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, and the Philippines. Looking ahead, TCEB expects Thailand to welcome 1,036,300 business events travellers, earning to the Thai economy 106,780 million baht revenue.
