They have now introduced a shuttle service in New York for Airport travel.\nEco Taxi is introducing an Airport shuttle service for the people of New York. Convenience is the idea behind this service. If someone doesn’t want to take his/her personal vehicle to the Airport, then shuttle service is the next best option. This shuttle service is offered for two Airports. JFK/Liberty Airport and Lagaurdia International Airport.\nThis shuttle service is currently working in New York and picks up passengers from all the major and famous places in New York. This service is a positive step towards the evolution of this company and an attempt to expand it. Convenience of the people is kept in mind to start this service because there are many airport shuttle services in New York and daily hundreds of people travel to Airport. If they don’t find the same level of comfort that they find in their personal vehicles, they’ll never use the shuttle service again. Rates are competitive and special care is taken to increase the comfort level of passengers.\nEco Taxi is a New York based, on call, car and taxi booking service. All kinds of cars including limousines can be booked. Currently they are offering their services only in NY. Their coverage area is Cold Spring Harbor, Lloyd Harbor, Huntington Bay, Dix Hills, Greenlawn, Commack, North Port, East Northport, Centre Port, Huntington Village, Melville, Eastern Central and Western Suffolk, Long Island area and many other places. A taxi, or car can be booked from all these places.\nContact Info\nEco Taxi\nWebsite: http://www.ecotaxiny.com/\nEmail: This email address is being protected from spambots.
