Due to the passage of the amended Live Entertainment Tax (LET) in the city of Las Vegas, a 9 percent tax will be added to each ticket price starting on Thursday, Oct. 1. To prevent guests from paying this excess fee, Pasquale Rotella, Founder and CEO of Insomniac, has moved up the EDC Las Vegas ticket on sale date, giving fans 10 days before the tax goes into effect to secure their passes. \nThree-day general admission passes start at the Early Owl price of $335 plus fees, followed by the Later Owl price of $355, plus fees. VIP passes will be available for $699 for those 21 and over, before service fees. Sleepy Owl tiered tickets will be effective starting Thursday, Oct. 1 and include the tax inflation. Sleepy Owl general admission and VIP passes will start at $386.95 and $761.91 respectively, before service fees. Layaway pricing options are available for all ticket types. \nLast year's VIP amenities included a dedicated entrance for expedited entry, multiple elevated viewing areas at EDC's impressive stages, private bars and wifi hotspots, high end dining options, separate restroom facilities, access to exclusive lounges, a dedicated Ferris wheel and more. \nIn 2015, a sold-out crowd of more than 400,000 attendees from around the world came together to experience three nights of the most anticipated music festival of the year. Insomniac treated fans to the largest, most innovative EDC Las Vegas yet, transforming the 1,000-acre speedway into a fully immersive, neon-lit playground.
