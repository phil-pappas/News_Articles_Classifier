He was then sentenced to eight years in jail in Panama for a 2000 bomb plot to assassinate Castro. He served four years before being pardoned.\nU.S. officials have refused to extradite Posada Carriles to either Cuba or Venezuela, despite extradition requests, on grounds that he could be tortured.", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubana_de_Aviaci%C3%B3n_Flight_455"], "published": "2015-09-03T02:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T21:16:01.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
