Each member of the family has his or her favorite for hiking, mountain biking, skiing, and backpacking, preferences constantly changing based on the needs of the moment. Which one has that valve I like? Wait, that pack doesn’t have enough capacity for my sweatshirt. Is that tube insulated? It’s cold out there. \nThe best hydration packs, based on how often they’re reached for, tend to be the no-nonsense, non-gimmicky, one-size-fits-all types that work well no matter what excursion and what conditions. The High Sierra Piranha falls into that category, and has been quite popular in our household. Plus, it’s on sale right now! \nThe Piranha is a 10 liter pack, which I believe is just the right size for most purposes. It’s not as sleek as an understated 5 or 8 liter cycling pack, and not as bulky as a 20+ liter pack. It sits quite snug against the back thanks to side compression straps, and features a stretchy front pocket for external storage. The main compartment is front-loading for easy grab-and-go, and there are plenty of attachment loops. \nI wish the shoulder straps were padded, but at only 10 liters, I suppose the pack never gets all that heavy (though carrying a hydration pack gives the term ‘water weight’ a whole new meaning). There is a sternum strap, which is nice, and the back panel features a mesh design to allow air flow. \nEven though High Sierra is often a more affordable brand than some, the Piranha doesn’t skimp on features. There’s a mesh sport flap too hold a helmet, which stows away if not needed, and the tube is insulated, which is so helpful during the winter months. If you’ve ever had your water freeze solid in your tube while skiing, you know what I mean. The waist belt is removable, so you can ditch it if it’s getting in the way, and the organizer pocket (usually my favorite part of any backpack) has a key fob and space for bike tools or ski tuning tools. \nThe system is BPA-free of course, and the reservoir holds two liters. I’m pretty picky about my reservoirs, and while this one isn’t my all-time favorite, it’s right up there, thanks to the wide mouth that’s easy to fill. After several hikes this summer, we never had any leakage, which is more than I can say for some models. Before filling up, the pack weighs in at 1.9 lbs. \nMy teen boys like that the Piranha comes in a standard black/silver color (they like how unisex it looks) but there are brighter options in cobalt/silver and kelly green/charcoal. Pick up a pack on High Sierra where it’s half off the $100 price tag right now, or try on Amazon , where it’s discounted as well.
