The AMC series came to an end earlier this year, after seven seasons, but Draper's pervasive influence – and Hamm's own charms – are clearly still making themselves felt. When the actor announced on Monday that that he had split from his partner of 18 years, actress Jennifer Westfeldt , fans were quick to celebrate \"Don's\" new single status. Several tweeters even jokingly offered to trade in their current partners, in return for the handsome US star. Just read Jon Hamm is single and screamed \"ye \" so loud alone in my apartment.

He didn't think it was funny. — Melissa Mercieca (@melissamercieca) September 8, 2015 Sadly, the actor, who is 44, appears to have had something of a troubled year. In March, he announced that he had attended a month-long rehab programme for alcohol addiction. While the reasons for his split from Westfeldt remain unknown, the couple released a joint statement to People Magazine , speaking of their \"great sadness\" at the decision.. With great sadness, we have decided to separate, after 18 years of love and shared history,\" they said. \"We will continue to be supportive of each other in every way possible moving forward.\" Jon Hamm and Jennifer Westfeldt Photo: REX FEATURES Jon Hamm and Jennifer Westfeldt (Rex)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T00:21:02.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
