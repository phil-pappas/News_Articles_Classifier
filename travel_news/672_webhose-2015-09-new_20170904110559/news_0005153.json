Some of the most famous and classical stories and legends about love, friendship, war and peace in the Chinese history will be illustrated and reflected in this stage performance.\nSupported by Student Life at MDC Wolfson and Kendall campuses, these events are co-sponsored by the Chinese Association of Science, Education and Culture of South Florida (CASEC). To join the annual celebration of Harvest Moon Festival at MDC, four leading groups of Chinese artists from Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties will participate in the second performance at Kendall Campus on Sept. 26.\nAs MDC’s partner university in China, Jiangsu Normal University has been supporting the Confucius Institute at MDC with various educational and cultural exchange programs since 2010.
