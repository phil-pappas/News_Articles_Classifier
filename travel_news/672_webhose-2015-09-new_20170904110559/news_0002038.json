Made with a “high-tech compact design”, JetComfy features two built-in 3000mAh USB chargers, an “ultra-soft, two inch-thick high quality memory foam cushion that conforms to the shape of your face\" and “tension coil springs” for added support when resting your head. Connected to a swivelling and tilting pole that can be adjusted to any height and strapped to any handle bar, the JetComfy pillow is said to be the only “comfort pillow” on the market to offer “real support” for your head and neck for sleeping in planes, airport terminals, trains, cars and even the office. • The world's most bizarre travel accessories Photo: Kickstarter.com Offering “360 degrees of adjustability”, the pillow can be fitted to various positions and sleeping preferences, allowing you to sleep in a “natural resting pose” without adding pressure to your neck and spine or disturbing neighbouring passengers, its designers claim. Other features include easy access compartments for storing a pen or stylus stick and your passport as well as washable soft microfiber pillowcases. Weighing just under 10 ounces (while its larger model Jet Comfy PLUS will weigh just under a pound), the pillow is said to be about the size of your hands and could easily fit into a purse or carry-on bag. JetComfy, which was launched on Kickstarter last month, is priced between $45 (£29) and $69 (£45) and hopes to be available for delivery by April. • The real reason airport shops want to see your boarding pass Photo: Kickstarter.com While JetComfy might offer a range of technical features, it appears a bit bulkier than the disc-shaped NapAnywhere pillow , introduced in 2013, which claimed to allow travellers to fall asleep wherever they are. The portable and collapsible foam structure can be twisted into shape and perched between your head and shoulder. The pillow comes with a strap that is pulled diagonally across your chest and tightened to keep it in place. The NapAnywhere pillow Photo: napanywhere.net Last year, an unusual hooded pillow claimed to provide extra comfort and privacy on your travels while taking the cosiness of a hooded jumper to the next level. The HoodiePillow, essentially a hood with a sleeping aid, comes with either a normal-sized pillowcase or an inflatable travel neck pillow attached. The inflatable neck pillow can be deflated and folded for easy storage, while the pillowcase comes with a small pocket, where you can store your smartphone or wallet, as well as portholes to keep your headphones “tangle-free” while listening to music. The HoodiePillow Photo: hoodiepillow.com In 2012, the unusually-shaped Ostrich Pillow was introduced, claiming to “enable power naps anytime, anywhere”, including in airport lounges and on planes, and help counter the negative effects of long-haul flights. Stuffed with synthetic material – “for maximum performance and lightness” – the distinctive-looking pillow has a hole in which to put your head, and a mouth hole designed to allow its wearer to breath easily. It also has two side holes where you can put your hands if needed.
