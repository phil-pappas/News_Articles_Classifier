Smaller crowds combined with milder weather and fall colors make for an extremely memorable visit.\"\nMesa Verde National Park , located in Southwest Colorado , is known for its rich history and outdoor adventure, including over 600 cliff dwellings and a look into the lives of the Ancestral Pueblo people. In addition to tours of the major archaeological and cultural sites, Far View Lodge and Mesa Verde offer visitors a spectacular array of fall colors in a very distinctive setting of oak brush, cottonwoods and aspens. October is also the perfect time of year to visit in order to avoid the summer crowds at Mesa Verde and fall crowds that flock to Aspen and Durango .\nBesides the park's beautiful trails and archeological tours, another way to experience the area is to take one of the many picturesque drives. San Juan Skyway, a 233-mile loop through the San Juan Mountains, is part of Colorado's Scenic and Historic Byway System and only 16 miles from the Park and Far View Lodge. Additionally, Trail of the Ancients, America's only National Scenic Byway dedicated solely to archaeology, highlights the archaeological and cultural history of southwestern Native American peoples.\nFar View Lodge, an ideal lodging destination inside Mesa Verde National Park offers traditional western decor, fantastic views and superior hospitality and dining options. Aside from the solitude and privacy the Lodge provides, visitors can enjoy hiking, biking, wildlife watching and stargazing from the their own balcony through Oct. 24, 2015 . Metate Room, the award-winning restaurant at Far View Lodge serving native cuisine, will also stay open during that time. The tent sites at Morefield Campground will remain open through October 18, 2015 for those looking to connect with nature.\nAbout Aramark Mesa Verde\nLodging, dining, retail and guided bus tours within Mesa Verde National Park are operated by Aramark Mesa Verde, an authorized concessioner of the National Park Service.
