Hear about her women’s writing retreat in Costa Rica, how writing enhances travel and more, in this week’s Girls That Go! GGG: Hi! Welcome to Girls That Go! Can you kick us off with who you are, where you’re from originally and how you got started traveling? I’m Leigh Shulman. I’m a writer and traveler currently living in NW Argentina. My blog The Future Is Red focuses on how life, travel and writing all fit together, and along with Jeannie Mark [GGG: a Girls That Go! alumna ] , I run Creative Revolution Retreats , Writing, Yoga & Renewal retreats designed specifically for women.\nI started traveling in 2007. At the time, my family and I were living in Brooklyn. I was a stay-at-home-mom. We realized, though, we weren’t happy there anymore, so we sold everything we owned and left to travel. \nWhere I’m originally from is always a hard question to answer. I was born in South Africa but my family left when I was five. Since then, I’ve lived in 4 other countries and traveled through many more. I’ve spent more time in the US than anywhere else, so maybe that’s where I’d call home. GGG: We heard that you are co-founding Creative Revolution Retreats. What inspired such a venture? \nA couple years ago, Jeannie hired me to help her edit her book of travel-related short stories. As we talked, we shared our experiences as women and what holds women back when it comes to both travel and writing. Creative Revolution Retreats was borne from our desire to create a space where women can push aside fear and expectation to create what they most want in their lives.What better way to do this while traveling and writing? GGG: Your upcoming retreat is for women writers, located in the beautiful country of Costa Rica. Why do you feel it’s important for women to have a retreat like this? And why set it in Costa Rica? Women too often push their own desires aside because of fear or uncertainty. We feel the pressure to be perfect or to meet the needs of others. Too often, women don’t trust themselves and their own opinions.\nWe wanted to create a space where women can relax, be pampered and focus on what they want. We chose Costa Rica and the Caribbean coast in particular, because my family and I used to live just across the border in Panama. Every three months, we had to leave Panama to renew our visas, so I’ve spent a good amount of time on this coast.There are gorgeous beaches, jungle hiking, amazing wildlife plus spas, great food and anything else you could want while on vacation. Much of the wildlife in this region is protected, too, and that awareness of conservancy appealed to us as well. GGG: Both you and Jeannie are world travelers and successful writers. How do you think travel can impact writing and vice versa? One thing that many travelers and writers have in common is that we see the world with a different lens.When you travel and immerse yourself in another country and culture, you start to realize that the norms of where you live are arbitrary. It helps you unhook from those norms and allows you to see the world in a way no one else does. The stories you tell, then, also become your own, beautiful unique view of life.\nWriting solidifies a place in my mind. I’ll remember the paths leading from town to town in the Cinque Terre and yoga on the rocks on the coast of Panama, because I’ve included those images in my writing. When I’ve spent time writing in a place, that place becomes even more special to me. GGG: What do you hope for the future of Creative Revolution Retreats? Are there any dream locations you’d love to travel to for a retreat? \nJeannie and I imagine Creative Revolution all over the globe. \nWe’re currently hosting a series of free writing webinars that has brought us in contact with women in Bali, Malaysia, Thailand, Nigeria and many other places. We’d love to make retreats available for all of them. \nGGG: Finally, what’s one travel moment you’ve had that you felt particularly compelled to weave into words and share? \nMy daughter Lila was 5 years old at the time, and we were in the San Blas islands north of Panama. It’s not the easiest place to reach. There are a few tiny planes a day that land on their dirt runway, and driving is almost impossible. \nIt is also an excruciatingly beautiful region. When you see photos of the perfect Caribbean island with white sand and palm trees, that’s usually from San Blas. What’s particularly interesting about this area is it’s one of the only areas on the planet where the indigenous people, the Kuna Yala, have full legal control and ownership of the land. \nI don’t think many people brought their kids to visit here, and all the children there were fascinated by Lila. They waited outside our door in the morning, chanting her name and calling her out to play. \nIt was a strange feeling to be so far from what I know and yet feel so much a part of the community. \nI wrote about it soon after we returned to the US and remember feeling more out of place in the mall down the street from where I grew up than I did on that island. \nGGG: Wonderful. Thanks so much for taking time to chat with us, Leigh! \nTo read more about Leigh’s travels, check out her blog , tweet with her or find her on Facebook ! \nAll photos in this post courtesy of Leigh Shulman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T04:09:55.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
