On this additional capacity, system wide traffic for August increased 10.1 percent. Air Canada reports traffic results on a system-wide basis, including regional airlines from which Air Canada purchases capacity and Air Canada rouge. \n\"I am extremely pleased to report strong traffic growth of 10.1 percent for the month of August, a month during which we served 4.2 million customers, more than any month in Air Canada's 78-year history,\" said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Air Canada generated greater traffic in all markets resulting in a load factor of 89.6 percent in line with last year's all-time record. These strong results demonstrate the effectiveness of our commercial strategy focusing on international growth. The impact of the economic slowdown in Western Canada is more than offset by strong demand in US and overseas markets resulting in a 9.9 percent traffic growth year-to-date compared to last year. I would like to thank our customers for choosing Air Canada as their preferred carrier and our employees for taking care of them and transporting them safely to their destination.\" \nAugust Year to Date \n2015 2014 Change 2015 2014 Change \nTraffic (RPMs mln) 7,315 6,645 +10.1% 46,140 41,980 +9.9% Capacity (ASMs mln) 8,165 7,398 +10.4% 54,702 49,939 +9.5% Load Factor 89.6% 89.8% -0.2 pts 84.3% 84.1% +0.2 pts \nCanada RPMs 2,057 1,964 +4.7% 12,307 11,884 +3.6% ASMs 2,346 2,210 +6.2% 14,711 14,264 +3.1% LF 87.7% 88.8% -1.1 pts 83.7% 83.3% +0.4 pts \nUS Transborder RPMs 1,074 928 +15.7% 8,129 7,043 +15.4% ASMs 1,234 1,072 +15.1% 9,716 8,466 +14.8% LF 87.1% 86.6% +0.5 pts 83.7% 83.2% +0.5 pts \nAtlantic RPMs 2,386 2,145 +11.2% 12,500 11,059 +13.0% ASMs 2,626 2,361 +11.2% 14,949 13,440 +11.2% LF 90.9% 90.9% 0 pts 83.6% 82.3% +1.3 pts \nPacific RPMs 1,347 1,206 +11.7% 9,105 8,323 +9.4% ASMs 1,454 1,310 +11.0% 10,527 9,483 +11.0% LF 92.7% 92.1% +0.6 pts 86.5% 87.8% -1.3 pts \nLatin America & Caribbean RPMs 451 402 +12.2% 4,099 3,671 +11.7% ASMs 505 445 +13.5% 4,799 4,286 +12.0% LF 89.2% 90.3% -1.1 pts 85.4% 85.6% -0.2 pts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T01:21:21.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
