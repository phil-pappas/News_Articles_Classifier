A delegation from the Seychelles Tourism Academy went to Namur last February. We have also seen students from Belgium who have come here for their work attachment at the Constance Ephelia Resort,” he said. \nMr. Monthy added that next month two lecturers at the Seychelles Tourism Academy ̶ Marcus Freminot and Gemina Raguin ̶ will undergo training in Belgium for two months. \nSpeaking at the certificate presentation ceremony held at the Seychelles Tourism Academy, Diana Quatre, the Manager of Studies for the Advanced Diploma in Hospitality Management course, said once the academy starts offering in-service training, its principal has promised to extend invitations to all hospitality and tourism establishments. \n“This is because when these establishments get recognition for their excellent service and standards, it is all as a result of a collective group effort, and it is a win for Seychelles. The in-service training will be free of charge until this department is properly set up at the Seychelles Tourism Academy,” she added. \nShe added that the courses were all sponsored by the Haute Ecole Hoteliere of Namur in Belgium and in greater part by the Constance Hotels and Beachcomber St. Anne Resort and Spa. \nOn behalf of the other trainees, Richard Mathiot, one of the professionals who attended the training, described the course as a good chance to go back to class for the refresher course. \n“As I strongly believe, it is never too late to learn, because learning is a never-ending process. Thank you so much for the brilliant topics covered during the training. I pledge that I will continue to use all opportunities given to increase my skills and knowledge,” he said. \nThose who took part in the training sessions were from Constance Ephelia Resort, Beachcomber Sainte Anne Resort, Kempinski Seychelles, Avani Seychelles Barbarons Resort, the Seychelles Tourism Board, the Tourism Department, and the Seychelles Tourism Academy. \nMr. Vandervaeren was invited by the Seychelles Tourism Academy to conduct these training sessions taking place at the Constance Ephelia Resort, Port Launay. \nThose who followed this course learned more on food costing, budgeting, food cost control as well as sales and marketing among other topics. \nTopics included an introduction to hospitality management, discovering the annual management plan ̶ from marketing plan to cash flow - and the essential components of hotel management. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
