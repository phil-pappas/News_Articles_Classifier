They are also made to be soft and gentle as the skin of a baby. Once in contact with liquid, the fibers separate into strands to provide quick absorption of up to 1.8 liters of water, leaving skin and hair semi-dry with remaining water quickly evaporating. Using this towel, therefore, is believed to save customers time, which they can spend doing other activities. The towel itself is also believed to dry 27% faster than cotton.\n“I have very thick hair and I would dry my hair for about 20 minutes. Using this towel, I am drying my hair in about 12 now. I can definitely feel how quickly it dries and absorbs the water. Saving 8 minutes every day is totally worth it!” expressed MSTORM, a verified Amazon customer.\nAlthough the quick dry microfiber towel is the same size of a regular towel, it is able to be folded down to the size of a t-shirt, and weighing 205 grams, the product is also lighter than a regular towel. Customers can easily pack one for their trips to the gym, beach, pool, or on camping trips where several items are taken along and space is needed.\nThis microfiber towel also removes the need to buy or rent a towel for different activities and locations, such as the beach, hotel or gym due to its space saving design.
