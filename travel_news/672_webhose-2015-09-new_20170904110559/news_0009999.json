This is the culmination of 15 years of school runs, concerts, away matches, hope, sweat, rows and despair. Small fortunes have been spent. Your own timetable lies in smithereens. You are probably by now on non-speakers with your child’s co-parent; you’ll certainly be on non-speakers with the child itself. Was it too much to hope for an ivy-clad quadrangle? A mortar board, respectfully tipped, or a leather trunk or two? Well, yes, it was. Instead you’ll find yourself unloading a landfill-site’s worth of black bin bags in a rather nondescript site covered in graffiti and buddleia. • Download the Telegraph's Clearing app for iPhone and Android Our daughter, arriving at university, had all her remaining chattels pinched from the unlocked car in the time that it took to carry the first two sacks upstairs. But take heart. They’ve actually chosen wisely. The shifting alchemies of which university is right for which child are bewildering. But that child, and its careers adviser, will have given this a great deal of thought. Fashions, attitudes, courses change drastically, certainly since one attended oneself. Having made their choice, however, they will vanish immediately into a haze of post-A-level celebrations and gap-year irresponsibility. Practical considerations will be forgotten. This is where you can help. Do some research for them. (Tactfully, it goes without saying: they will be flexing their independent-decision-making muscles and won’t welcome your input.) Find out about night buses or bike routes, and weave a safety net. Get the bush-telegraph humming. In these days of social media it will be easy to find an ally whose child attended the same institution relatively recently. Share inside information, especially regarding those practical concerns that don’t feature on most students’ radars. Rather than the nearest “happy hour two-for-one”, how far away are the lecture halls or the medical centre? Share inside information, especially regarding practical concerns Photo: Rex Features Find someone who lives relatively close by whose son or daughter is leaving for the same university. Sharing travel costs on the repeated journeys back and forth will represent a considerable saving. And reacquaint yourself with any friend of your own generation who happens to live near the campus. That they will ever be called upon to deal with a crisis in loco parentis is highly unlikely, but you will sleep better for it. However much money you give your child at the start of each term, they will always be broke. Their diet will be appalling and they’ll be shopping at Poundland. Make like Queen Mary and send them off with a tuck box of things that they would never think of buying, or be able to afford, but which will nevertheless civilise their new surroundings. Consider the inexpensive following list: a mattress-protector, cafetière, vitamin C, windowsill herbs, first aid kit, Parmesan and grater, bike safety helmet and impregnable combination lock, hot water bottle, 4-way multi-socket adaptor, washable duvet, sneaky health and travel insurance (why not?), plus laptop, but more crucially, a broadband contract. That way they’ll have no excuses for not Skyping you. And a cuddly toy. (Actually, don’t embarrass them with one of those, nor a framed photo of your white-haired selves.) And most important of all, get them a mini-fridge for their own room, rather than the communal kitchen. Student friendships can, and will, survive many things but will invariably founder over the disappearance of food. Five golden rules Do forget about their accommodation deposit. There’s every chance that you won’t see it again. Don’t neglect your child’s co-parent – take good care of each other. Nothing works like a bit of emotional blackmail – “your mother isn’t taking it well ...” – to elicit the odd email that isn’t just about money. Do persuade them not to take a car. They’ll be spending every waking hour providing an unofficial taxi service, and the insurance will be crippling. Don’t let them leave home with pets. Goldfish are a particular no-no. Mine vanished on the last day of term. Returning in September, I was astonished to find it swimming around the lavatory cistern. Do advise your child that it’s not a good idea for them to be the principal signatory on any rental document. • Download the Telegraph's Clearing app for iPhone and Android Sign up to our student life newsletter for news, opinion and advice ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T10:28:09.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
