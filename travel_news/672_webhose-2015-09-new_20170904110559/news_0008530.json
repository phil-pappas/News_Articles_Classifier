Video courtesy of Intrepid Travel \nThere are times when you travel when your preconceptions of an event or place and the reality are so far removed it can blow your mind. This is one of those times. \nI'd pictured Golden Rock as a sedate site of reverence, a smattering of travellers, a few dozen monks praying silently beside candles flickering in the twilight. It's safe to say I may have underestimated things. \nAt the top of a mountain path, where a clearing has just opened up, enough people to fill a football stadium swarm a vast tiled square like frenzied ants around their nest. Aside from a few western faces, most are locals, many of them Buddhist monks of all ages, their saffron robes resplendent in the evening light. YOUTUBE/SCREENGRAB \nGolden Rock, Myanmar: Asia's mysterious giant rock defying the rules of gravity \nOn the far side, perched precariously on the edge of a cliff stands the rock itself; a giant, gravity-defying monolith plastered in so much gold leaf it looks like a prop from a 1950s sci-fi film. \nGolden Rock, or Kyaiktiyo Pagoda as it's also known, is a sacred pilgrimage site in Mon State, some 200 kilometres northeast of Yangon. Crowned by a pagoda, it's situated at the top of Mt Kyaiktiyo and looks by all accounts as though it may tumble down the mountainside at any moment should someone sneeze in its general direction. \nLegend has it the rock maintains its unlikely balance thanks to a meticulously placed strand of Buddha hair and whether you buy into this folklore or not, it is undeniably a freak of geography. \nFor most pilgrims, coming here would have been a dream for many years and the arduous journey up the mountain is seen as an integral part of the experience. From Kin Pun – a hub of shops and hotels serving as base camp – it's a steep 11 kilometre uphill march to get to this point. \nBut like the majority of travellers, I instead opted to get here via a white-knuckle ride on an open top truck. These hydraulic powered beasts carry up to 40 people on simple wooden benches, much like souped up double-decker buses. Navigating a series of hairpin bends on a partially cemented road, they are as close to being on a rollercoaster, without actually being on a rollercoaster as you're ever likely to come. From the drop-off point, it's then only a ten-minute up hill stroll to the main attraction. \nThousands of people make the pilgrimage to Golden Rock: Image: ScreenGrab \nWith the sky transitioning from streaky bacon to cobalt blue and then a rich lilac, the rock is beginning to showcase some of its star quality. At over seven metres tall, burning brilliant gold against the fading sun, it has an increasingly surreal quality. Ad Feedback \nHaving kicked off my thongs at the base of the hill – as custom demands – I wander the square taking in the scene, enjoying the feel of the tiles beneath my feet, still baked warm from the afternoon sun. In the far corner, a row of shops sell soft drinks, fruits and candles, a Buddhist convenience mall of sorts, though most visitors appear to have come prepared. \nPeople carrying wicker baskets on their heads zigzag around me in all directions, groups gather on straw mats, there's an almost festival air, like the Glastonbury of Buddhism, only the thumping tunes and pints of lager have been replaced by josticks and pious devotion. \nThe whole spectacle is a model of tradition; a throwback to earlier times seldom seen in the modern world. \nBut there are more unexpected sights, as bemusing as they are surprising. Everywhere I look, monks are taking selfies on smart phones or iPads or posing for photos before the rock in huddled groups like a football team that's just bagged a major trophy. \nIt's a strange juxtaposition I notice throughout my time Myanmar, which until recently was the world's second most isolated nation. Slowly, somewhat insidiously, it appears the modern world is creeping in. \nSelfie sticks and iPads aside, there is a tranquil air to the proceedings. In spite of the vast crowds, people are anything but aggressive, eye contact is invariably met with a smile or a shy laugh, there's no argy bargy or mindless shoving as you might encounter in other places. \nWith night settling in, the action around the shrine intensifies. Crowds congregate to light josticks and candles; soon the air is thick with the smell incense, hundreds of tiny flames winking in the darkness. \nWhen night arrives, Golden Rock comes to life. Image: Guy Wilkinson \nIt's late but the temperature is still warm. With the average price of a hotel room beyond the reach of most that live here, many will hunker down in swags or sleeping bags, or simply make do with a straw mat and a blanket on the tiled floor. \nPart of me would genuinely relish sleeping out beneath the stars, but there are plenty of hotels in the area and we opt to stay at the Mountaintop, a plush, cliff edge property ten minutes stroll downhill from the main square. \nIt may not be the truest path to enlightenment, but a cold beer and a hot shower certainly feel like Nirvana at this point. \nIt's still dark when we reconvene at five the next morning to watch the sunrise over the rock. Outside the hotel there is already a steady flow of people heading downhill to make an early getaway. \nHundreds of metres below us, a thick blanket of cloud rolls out towards the horizon above the surrounding jungle canopy. \nWeaving between the throng, it's hard to ignore the hermits, stood motionless in the centre of the street at periodic intervals. They're dressed in brown robes, sporting what resemble elongated pirates' hats; carrying wooden beams over their shoulders, a bucket attached to each end. Scowling, gazing intently into the middle distance, they strike simple triangular bells, waiting patiently for donations. \nREAD MORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T03:30:23.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
