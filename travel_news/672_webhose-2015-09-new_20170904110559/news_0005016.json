The other, tea, could be black, green, white or herbal. \nBut even though it’s a minimalist drink, it does have a spot among the pantheon of cold beverages and harps on quality. \nWe are an iced tea culture, and we are the only country in the world. \nPeter Goggi, president of Tea Association of the USA \nGood, fresh tea leaves and water are paramount for a perfect iced tea. “It is important to use fresh ingredients because they give the best flavor,” says Nathaniel Pantalone, owner and manager of Dobra Tea in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill. \nCynthia Gold, tea sommelier and manager of L’Espalier in Boston, adds that any water won’t do. \n“Don’t use water that has a chemical or chlorine taste,” Gold says. “If your local water tastes off, consider using filtered or spring water.” \nAlso, Gold says, if the same water is reboiled often, you will be de-oxygenating the water. \n“This can lead to a flatter tasting tea.” \n82 percent of Americans drink tea \nIt is best to use fresh, cold water because it contains more oxygen than hot water from the faucet. Tea meisters say more oxygen is important because it enhances the flavor of the tea. When the water comes to a rolling boil, pour it over loose tea leaves or a tea bag, and the burst of hot water will open the tea leaves and maximize the flavor. \nTypically crisp teas are good cold, and rich teas are used in hot beverages. Pantalone says “tea that is good cold is also good hot, but it doesn’t necessarily work the other way around. Some kinds of fermented Chinese teas called Pu-er make great hot teas but horrendous cold teas.” \nAlthough iced tea is extremely popular during the summer months, it has become the beverage of choice year-round. \nBret Thorn, senior food editor at Nation’s Restaurant News, says iced teas are getting more popular as “consumers are getting increasingly wary of carbonated drinks and their sugar and artificial sweeteners.” They want something cold and refreshing, and so turn to iced tea, he said. Consumers also think it has a health halo effect, he adds. \n46 percent of tea drinkers use sugar (includes artificial sweeteners) \nPeter Goggi, president of Tea Association of the USA, says 85 percent of tea consumed in America is iced. \n“We are an iced tea culture, and we are the only country in the world.” \nConsumption is driven up by baby boomers and millennials. In fact, 87 percent of millennials drink tea, according to the Tea Association. Goggi says that’s because millennials grew up hearing “the tea and health story” and they grew up in the ready-to-drink era that accepted tea as a good alternate beverage to soda. \nAlthough its popularity has risen in the last two decades, iced tea has been around for a long time. \nRichard Blechynden is credited with making the first iced tea in 1904, when he purportedly poured tea over ice at the World’s Fair in St. Louis because sales for his hot tea were plummeting when temperatures were soaring that summer. \nHowever, there are earlier written accounts of ice tea, according to Goggi. One is as early as 1879, and the recipe credited to Marion Cabell Tyree used green tea. Later, in 1884, a recipe from Boston Cooking School called for tea to be poured over ice, he said. \n43 percent go for tea to boost their immune system \nWhen making iced tea, Pantalone says it’s best to use a lot of tea in a batch. “We often see people using too little tea. We recommend eight to 14 teaspoons of tea per gallon depending on the tea,” he says. \nThe tea also should have room to expand during the infusion process because if it doesn’t the tea won’t properly release flavor to the water, he says. \nGenerally, the tea is steeped in hot water for about six to 15 minutes before additives such as fruits or herbs are added. “Anything longer than 15 usually ends up being a waste of time,” Pantalone says. “But, if the leaves are compacted in some way, like with pearl tea or rolled teas, then longer is better.” \nIf planned ahead, tea could also be steeped in cold water. “It’s marvelous. You simply put your leaves into fresh cold water and place them in the refrigerator overnight,” Gold says. “Taste your tea and remove the bags at that point, or give it up to 24 hours.” \n37 percent drink tea to calm them down \nThe optimal time for steeping will depend on the tea leaf variety and size. “I like to use a larger amount of tea leaves for a cold steep than you would for a hot steep. Perhaps one-third more,” Gold says. \nIf you want to sweeten the tea, add the sweetener after brewing tea in hot water. If the sweetener is added earlier, it will change the osmotic pressure of the water on the tea leaves, which will result in a slower infusion, Pantalone says. However, he adds that you don’t have to wait for the water to completely cool down because sugar will dissolve in tea more quickly at higher temperatures. \nDon’t be put off if the iced tea looks cloudy, which in the industry is called “creaming.” \n“It does not mean that there is anything wrong with the tea. In fact, some of the finest quality leaves will cloud; it is just that it is throwing off a precipitate that is clouding the tea,” Gold says. “If you hot steep your tea very strongly and then rush cool it, you are more likely to cause it to cream.” \n“Cloudiness in iced tea, especially iced black tea, is actually a good thing,” Pantalone adds. \n26 percent choose tea to maintain a healthy weight \nIs there a magic time within which iced tea should be served? Well, it all depends on the tea variety. \n“Iced black teas keep very well in the refrigerator for about a week, but iced Jasmine teas can get funky after about three or four days. The best time to serve iced tea would be as soon as it’s ready. But that is easier said than done,” Pantalone says. \nBLUEBERRY ICED TEA 4 tea bags (regular or black tea) 1 cup fresh blueberries 1 cup water 1/2 lime \nPour boiling water over tea bags; let steep for about 10 minutes. Remove tea bags. In a saucepan, bring to boil blueberries, sugar and 1 cup of water. Let cool and then blend them. Strain the syrup. Add juice from lime and stir to combine. Combine tea and blueberry syrup in pitcher. Serve with ice. \nPEACH ICE TEA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T07:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T11:22:57.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
