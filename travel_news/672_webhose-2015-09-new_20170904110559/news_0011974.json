You’re stuck at your desk and the day seems to be going on forever. Your mind starts to wander — at first to “anywhere but here,” but then to exotic, faraway lands where your everyday problems and stress melt in the presence of true paradise. You want to go to there, and we want to go with you. Every day at 3 p.m. Eastern, we’ll send you a picture of the place we at Yahoo Travel are daydreaming about so we can all take that mental vacation together. Let’s go to… \nPhoto: Kacper Gunia/Flickr \n…Gibraltar!!! Do you like the Mediterranean Sea and monkeys? Then this daydream is for you! Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory located on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula. Every year, thousands of tourists head to Gibraltar by land, air, or sea (it’s also a popular cruise port) to see the famed Rock of Gibraltar and hang out with the local population of adorable Barbary macaques. If giant rocks and primates aren’t your thing, there’s plenty else to keep you busy including casinos, marinas, cricket games, and duty-free shopping. Translation: there’s something for everyone!
