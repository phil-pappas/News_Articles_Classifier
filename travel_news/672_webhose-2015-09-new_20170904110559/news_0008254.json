Rivera Rocafort’s strategic plan for the agency. Quality of service encompasses several elements that make a difference in the reputation of a destination, such as cleanliness, how guests are treated, ability to satisfy guests’ needs and solving unexpected situations.\n“From day one as Executive Director of the Puerto Rico Tourism Company, I told myself that one of the main pillars of my work here would be enhancing the quality of our service through a program that would include all of our citizens in order to make a real difference in the experience lived by our guests, and today I can say with great pleasure that this program is ready for implementation,” said Rivera Rocafort. The Executive Director added, “Puerto Rico has great attributes: spectacular natural landscapes, impressive historical monuments and a rich cultural heritage, but there is no doubt that our best attribute is our people, who are widely known for their warmth and hospitality.\nNonetheless, it is necessary to translate this attribute in a more effective manner and with our Quality Service Program we aim to provide our people better tools in order to take hospitality to the next level and encourage the arrival of more visitors.”\nTo develop the program, the PRTC team embarked on a comprehensive research process to help determine the areas in which to be implemented, as well as the strategies to be followed to achieve success in this important project. Based on the data collected through interviews, focus groups and research, PRTC’s Quality Service Program focuses on three main aspects: awareness, training, and recognition.\nThe awareness phase is aimed at strengthening service capabilities at both the internal and external levels. The first step will be to strengthen the capabilities of the agency’s team to enhance the quality of the services they provide to clients, partners and guests and at the same time, to serve as spokespeople of the program amongst citizens. Also, PRTC is working in a partnership with the Department of Education to provide a series of workshops during the 2015-2016 school year, in addition to a summer camp which educates students interested in working in the tourism industry about the importance of quality service.\nSource:- OneCaribbean", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T06:11:32.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
