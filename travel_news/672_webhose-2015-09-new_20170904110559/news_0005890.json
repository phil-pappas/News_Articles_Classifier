For what feels LITERALLY like miles. And when you finally get to the top of the mountain, you'd think there'd be something rewarding to do. Think again. When you get to the top - oh look. More mountains that I don't want to climb in silence. The one good thing about the mountain top is you can see a lot of plants and point to them. But if you expect your one true love to hold your hand and experience a plant inspired euphoria, I have some disappointing news for you. Not only will she not hold your hand, she'll go sit by herself on the other side of the mountain top. That wasn't in the brochure, Yosemite. When night finally came, it was really cold. There was no place to plug in the space heater, and it was taking up half of the tent. So I'll be returning THAT to Home Depot. We made dinner in silence and she drank a lot as we listened to the sound of other campers pretending to enjoy themselves and decided just to go to sleep and end the disappointing day.
