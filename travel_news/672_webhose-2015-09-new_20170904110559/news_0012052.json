They tramped silently through the darkness until four people, illuminated by their glowing flashlights, caught their attention.\nIt was September, sea turtle nesting season, and the rangers had orders to search anyone walking the beach at night to check for poached turtle eggs. It should have been a routine search, but when the rangers approached the group and introduced themselves, they were greeted with hostility.\n“I know who you bastards are,” one man said. Then he pushed one of the rangers, 24-year-old Mauricio Steller, and pulled a machete from his belt. The other two men also drew machetes and threw themselves at the rangers. As Steller dodged blows from his assailants he could smell alcohol on their breath.\nSteller’s partner swung his rifle around, but the gun was jammed. He pointed it at the attackers and used it to block machete swipes as he yelled desperately for help. Steller drew his own service weapon, a 9mm pistol, and ordered the men to drop their machetes. The men continued to advance and Steller loaded his gun. He fired, it jammed.\nSteller sprinted back 30 meters into complete darkness, reloaded his weapon and fired warning shots. As the ranger retreated one of the attackers, Alix Castro, followed.\n“Halt, or I’ll shoot,” Steller said, firing a warning bullet into the sand. Castro stepped forward and said, “Bastard, you are going to have to kill me, or I’ll kill you,” then he lunged with the machete.\nSteller fired his gun and buried a bullet into his attacker’s chest.\nCastro did not die that night on the beach, but he lost the use of 70 percent of his body and was relegated to a wheelchair. Friday, Steller will go to prison for twelve years for attempted murder.\nLegally on their own\nCosta Rican park rangers have always had a dangerous job. Policing some of the most remote parts of the country, rangers inevitably butt heads with illegal loggers, gold miners, hunters and poachers.\n“During their normal duties park rangers are always vulnerable to to an attack,” Eliecer Arce, the administrator for Corcovado National Park told The Tico Times. “You try to avoid it, but it’s inevitable that sometimes someone will come at you with a gun or a machete.”\nTo defend themselves, park rangers are often issued guns, but their legal role as police remains ambiguous. While park rangers are considered “wilderness police” in some legal arenas, they are not included in the General Police Law ( Ley 7410 ) when it comes to on-the-job protections. When a park ranger uses his or her service weapon while on duty, the case is treated like any civilian self-defense case, and the National System of Conservation Areas ( SINAC ) is prohibited from providing them legal counsel even if the charges were incurred on the job.\nIt was under these legal conditions, with his own private lawyer, that Steller presented his case to a panel of judges in Golfito. The defense had little evidence beyond Steller’s version of events, which was encapsulated in a 4-page legal complaint he filed the night of the shooting. The Judicial Investigation Police never visited the crime scene and the machete that Castro allegedly used to attack Steller was never recovered.\nCourt backlogs delayed the proceedings for six years and by trial time Castro had died from an infection he contracted in the gunshot wound four years after his injury. Though the prosecution did not up Steller’s charges to murder, the court determined that the gunshot was the eventual cause of Castro’s death and considered that in its decision and sentencing.\nOn August 28, the Criminal Court of Osa found Steller guilty of attempted murder and sentenced him to 12 years in prison. Friday, the court will finalize the sentence and take him into custody.\nSupporters of Steller have launched campaigns on social media in his support.\nYo soy GUARDAPARQUE, yo soy Mauricio Steller! pic.twitter.com/jez1V3Yznw\n— Arturo MF-CRC506 (@ArthuroMorflls) September 3, 2015\nPresidente de Costa Rica, Luis Guillermo Solis, solicitamos indulto para Mauricio Steller #tortugasmarinas https://t.co/Laqe2BpThu\n— CICTMAR (@CICTMAR) September 2, 2015\nWith help from the Environment Ministry, the park ranger was able to secure the pro bono services of famed criminal attorney Juan Diego Castro, who will present an appeal on Sept. 24. Even if the appeal is successful, it is likely that Steller will serve at least some prison time.\nIn the week since Steller’s trial, environmental groups and politicians have come out in support of the park ranger.\nAmnistía para el Guardaparques Mauricio Steller!

According to Álvarez there are at least four other park rangers awaiting trial for violent incidents that occurred on the job.\nCorcovado National Park administrator Arce said, “Something needs to change. … Today one ranger falls, but tomorrow it could be another. They can go to jail just for doing their jobs.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CICTMAR/status/639200325853954048", "https://twitter.com/bloqueverde/status/638919322581139456", "https://t.co/Laqe2BpThu", "http://t.co/sbWAmTZZ4r", "http://t.co/jez1V3Yznw", "http://www.sinac.go.cr/Paginas/Inicio.aspx", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/tortugasmarinas?src=hash", "http://www.feconcr.org/", "https://twitter.com/ArthuroMorflls/status/639414035486605313", "http://www.hacienda.go.cr/centro/datos/Ley/Ley%207410-Ley%20General%20de%20Polic%C3%ADa-26%20MAY-1994.doc"], "published": "2015-09-04T04:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T00:35:14.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
