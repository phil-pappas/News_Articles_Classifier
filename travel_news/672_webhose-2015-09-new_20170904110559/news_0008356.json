He then briefly has one hand let go of the crane, flashing it on camera before grabbing the crane again and climbing back up.\nUrban climbing has become something of a recent phenomenon, with people making dangerous climbs and posting their efforts after the fact to social media sites, like YouTube. In July, six men were arrested in Vancouver after climbing a crane, and Halifax has seen multiple incidents within the past year.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/DfOKwiSw0n0", "http://www.canoe.com/Travel/Destinations/Other/2014/02/13/21467671-relaxnews.html", "http://www.canoe.com/Travel/Destinations/Other/2015/05/12/22393936-relaxnews.html", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfOKwiSw0n0"], "published": "2015-09-24T01:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T02:58:41.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
