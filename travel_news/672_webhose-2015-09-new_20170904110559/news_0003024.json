What we really saw was a lot of pent-up demand, from visitors who hadn’t been taking vacations for a number of years because of the economy saying ‘this year we’re going.'”\nThe 75th Sturgis Motorcycle Rally helped, too. While the rally does hurt certain tourism business catering to families – many of whom tend to stay away during the early August rally – it brought up overall numbers and spending. Hundreds of thousands of bikers will have that effect.\nHagen expects a strong autumn season, highlighted by the 50th Custer State Park Buffalo Roundup later this month.\nAfter a soggy spring in some areas, excellent summer weather overall had people hitting the road. At the long-popular Reptile Gardens, good news came early and kept coming.\n“We had an absolutely fabulous summer,” said Reptile Gardens public relations manager John Brockelsby. “Every month we were open — April, May, June, July, August — up, up, up, up. So we couldn’t be more pleased with the visitor numbers we had this year.”\nRevenues from the tax are up 17 percent from this time a year ago, which was up 2 percent to 3 percent from the year before. Hagen said the 17 percent hike in the tax revenue reflected a much greater impact from the spending overall.\nTourism is the second largest industry in South Dakota, with visitors spending more than $865 million statewide.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T19:22:29.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
