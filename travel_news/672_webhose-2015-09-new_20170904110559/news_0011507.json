It´s a first for a branded hotel. Opening this month, this 6500sqm ‘styled with substance’ venue will provide a unique, elegant and technologically advanced proposition for weddings, conferences, meetings and events. \nAs part of a £20m top to toe development The Crowne Plaza Gerrards Cross Hotel (previously The Bellhouse Hotel) will include two large, flexible conference and banqueting spaces seating up to 350 and 260 persons respectively, six meeting rooms, a Creative Attic, breakout bar and beautifully landscaped gardens. \"Successful meetings, conferences and events need more than just ‘rooms’. They require the right combination of space, atmosphere and service as a tailored solution”, said Sonja Schiefer, Director of the European Studio of Designworks in Munich. “Therefore Designworks developed a set of principles that enabled and inspired the Crowne Plaza Gerrards Cross to create a meeting and event space that is both functionally convincing and emotionally engaging. Because meetings are not just about work, they are social events taking place in a special context”, Schiefer continues. Specialist hotel interior designers Dexter Moren Associates were briefed to bring the vision of BMW Group Designworks to life, creating a bright, light ‘outside, in’ space utilising the surrounding gardens and natural sunlight. Said Jacqui Kirk, Director of DMA “These spaces aim to be a breath of fresh air. We will be utilising a neutral colour temperature to create a welcoming atmosphere but punctuated with varying characters, dependent on the areas. The palette will reflect the hues of nature to enable the space to sit well within its country context and also allow versatility. One of the statement features will be the timber bar in the pre-function space.” continued Kirk. “Inspired by Japanese woodcuts, it will feature an abstract leaf design. When the bar is open the slatted leaf design can be closed off to create a distinctive artwork piece, which anchors the space visually and harks back to the external inspiration. “It has also been important for us to ensure the space meets with the brand requirements of a Crowne Plaza, ensuring a design that is contemporary, upscale and enables the highest level of comfort, service and amenities.” The innovation principles provided by BMW Group Designworks for the meetings and events space will be creatively and fluidly interpreted. They will feature a mix of private working zones, islands and comfortable niches, which can be adapted, re-configured and re-arranged to suit the needs of each host. The Crowne Plaza Gerrards Cross Hotel will reflect and respond to the evolving technological advancements of present day businesses. The hotel has been fitted with the latest innovations, including progressive Wi-Fi capabilities, sound systems and projection screens for presentations and speeches. David Jones, General Manager for Crowne Plaza Gerrards Cross, commented, “We believe we are creating what will be the most sought after events space outside of the capital. The superior design, sheer scale of space available and attention to detail, will make it a superb choice for event organisers or couples looking to host their special day.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T12:29:32.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
