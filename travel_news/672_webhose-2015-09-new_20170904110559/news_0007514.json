Considering your destination, available time, budget, and appetite for adventure, find the mode of transportation that best fits your needs. \nImportant Note: Make sure your passport and visa are in order before you start your journey. Car: Driving yourself is not recommended. Between making the transition from one side of the road to the other (Hong Kong and China drive on opposite sides), and road signs being a mere suggestion to local drivers, the risk outweighs the reward.\nThe most comfortable and convenient way to travel is to let someone else do the driving for you. You can get door-to-door service without having to navigate. \nCar/Limo services are widely available but are pricey. Rates range from $400 to over $800 (HKD) per hour depending on the type of car and service you require. \nTip: Try to negotiate a flat rate from pick-up to destination point, as traffic can be congested in and around the border crossing; a good rate can quickly become exorbitant when paying hourly. \nMore Car Service Info Train: The train is a reliable (and affordable) transportation link between Hong Kong and the mainland. The KCR (Kowloon-Canton Railway) connects Hong Kong with Shenzhen (Lo Wu), Dongguan and Guangzou. The furthest of these points, Guangzou, can be reached in under two hours. Journey times can vary depending on how long the lines are in immigration, however, so plan accordingly.\nIf your hotel is on the Kowloon side, you need the Hunghom station. If you are on Hong Kong Island, catch the MTR, get off at Kowloon Tong, and follow signs for the KCR. \nFares range from $145 to $250 (HKD), depending on class of service and route. \nMore Train Info Ferry: Taking the ferry is a speedy and comfortable option for getting to mainland China. Ferries depart from both Kowloon and Hong Kong International Airport, and are operated by separate ferry companies. From either point, you can get get to many destinations in China, including Shekou (Shenzhen) and Fuyong (Shenzhen Airport).\nRates are reasonable, and range from $120 to $300 (HKD) each way, depending on class and destination. \nMore Ferry Service Information Plane: For travel to northern and central China (Beijing, Shanghai), you'll want a faster mode of transport. Hong Kong International Airport connects to 40 inland destinations in China.\nImportant Note: These flights are considered international flights. A $90 (HKD) fee will be assessed at the airport, so you will need cash handy (U.S. currency or credit cards not accepted).
