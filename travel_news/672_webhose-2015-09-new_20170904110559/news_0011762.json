Located smack-dab in the middle of Central America, Honduras is not only easily accessible for travelers based in the Americas, it is also blessed with numerous natural attractions, a rich culture, and friendly people. Add the fact that it is one of the region’s most affordable escapes, and there’s no question about it—Honduras is a great getaway. \nIt’s impossible to summarize an entire country in just a few hundred words. But if you’re looking for a way to get started on planning that getaway in Honduras, consider the following: \nFor Wildlife Lovers: \nThere’s no shortage of wildlife encounters to be had in Honduras. Avid birdwatchers might consider Cuero y Salado Wildlife Refuge ; not only are there a variety of birds that flock to the reserve’s fresh and saltwater wetlands, there is also the opportunity to take a boat ride through the mangrove ecosystems to search for crocodiles, manatees and other wildlife. Alternatively the area around Pico Bonito is often considered to be the capital of eco-adventure in Honduras. The national park consists of rainforests, waterfalls, rivers and mountains; birding, hiking, trekking and whitewater rafting are just a few of the popular area attractions. \nFor Scuba Diving: \nTalk to any avid scuba diver, and chances are they have scuba dived (or want to scuba dive) around Honduras’ Bay Islands. Roatan and Utila are the two most popular dive destinations. Not only do they boast beautiful beaches, but the MesoAmerican Barrier Reef is just a short snorkel away from the shore. If you’re lucky, you might even get the opportunity to swim with whale sharks while you’re here! \nFor History and Culture: \nNo visit to Honduras is complete without a visit to the Copan Ruins . Once a great center of Mayan culture and civilization, today the archeological site is a UNESCO World Heritage Site with fantastic Mayan art and sculptures, along with a well-run museum. The town of Tela has some of Honduras’ most beautiful (if somewhat ill kept) beaches, as well as easy access to nearby nature reserves. But those in search of an off-the-beaten-track experience should consider a stop at Tela for the Garifuna Villages. A visit to these traditional villages provides a unique opportunity to learn about the Garifuna, descendents of African slaves who intermarried with native Carib and Arawak Indians. \nFor A Luxurious Retreat: \nThe cost of living in Honduras is quite low, which means it is relatively easy to indulge in a luxury escape without breaking the budget. Just remember to be respectful and give back to the community when you can. One great way to pamper yourself without having to feel guilty about it is to stay at an EcoLodge. There are numerous EcoLodges listed here to get you started. \nWhich type of Honduras getaway sounds like your ideal vacation?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T22:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T03:41:56.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
