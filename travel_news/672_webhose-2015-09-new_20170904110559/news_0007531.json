The back three for England have been branded up and rightly so. They've been playing extremely well. And knowing George North, having played with him, he'll make Saturday night personal. He'll want to come off feeling he's played much better than May or Watson or Brown. That's the pressure George puts himself under. He is a big-game player. He's performed well on big stages and now this World Cup doesn't come much bigger. This game on Saturday is massive, in what has been a thrilling start to the tournament with the lesser teams, the Japanese, the Tongans, the Georgians delighting not only rugby fans, but the neutrals. This is a massive game for the wider family who look out for him – Wales, and the Welsh rugby community. George knows that. His mindset will be to go out and perform to the best of his ability, get involved in the game early on, get an early touch, and it's a personal battle as well. When I played against the best players in the world, my mindset used to be, don't let this guy make a fool of you. Make sure you have a better game than them. You've got to have that approach. That's why George is so good – he takes his performances very personally. From teammates to rivals George plays his club rugby at Northampton with Courtney Lawes , of course. They will be on opposing sides. George said this of Courtney: \"Yes, we’re teammates and we get on. He’s a good guy and I’m sure we would be friends whatever we were doing. It happens all the time in rugby [having to play against your team-mate]. It’s something I’ve done in the past and I’ll do it again in the future. We get on very well anyway, so we’ll focus on the rugby and just enjoy it. We’re friends but we’re also professionals.\" After the match it's friendship as usual. But plenty of banter on the field though is key... George is an experienced enough player to know that he needed to be fully prepared and ready for this England game. It's difficult watching your team win a game by 50 points, as he had to do last Sunday from the sidelines as Wales played Uruguay. As a winger you always think that if you had been on the field you could have scored a couple of tries. But with the experience George has got now, he knows he needs to be 100 per cent fit for the England game. He will be starting. He will have been one of the first names on the team sheet. He's experienced enough now to know he needs to be fully fit for this game and ready to go. George's concussion You have to have a different mindset. There's nothing worse than training and playing with a niggle. It really affects you. You always wonder whether you're going to make it worse by playing and training. You wonder whether it's worse than you think it is. It always plays on your mind. In a competition like this, when you're in a camp for four to eight weeks, it can play mind games with you. It can be very difficult. But they have the support network there, the facilities there, the physio and the treatment to keep on top of it and that's a must. If you're feeling unsure going into a game, the best thing for you is not to play because you're only going to make it worse. You want to play in the big games and you want to make sure you're fit and ready and able to give 100 per cent. At international level, if you're not 100 per cent fit or are playing with an injury, it's a fine line between being caught out and not being caught out. You could be playing against one of the best players in the world on the opposite wing and if he knows and can see you're struggling with some kind of strain or injury he can make a real fool of you out there. That's why it's very important that you're mentally ready and physically as fit and as comfortable as you can be. It's important that you feel supported. I message most of the boys before the big games. Sometimes when there is a bit of bad news, they do need a bit of cheering up. I'll be messaging George before the England game, as well as many other players, wishing them the best of luck and just reminding him while he'll be playing on Saturday. I'll tell him that he's playing because he's the best winger and because he brings so much to the team. He just needs to have the right mental attitude and perform like he does week in, week out for Northampton, and as George has done for Wales. He'll be fine. They've got the whole of Wales supporting them and they've got me as well. • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T19:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T13:41:19.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
