You’re stuck at your desk and the day seems to be going on forever. Your mind starts to wander — at first to “anywhere but here,” but then to exotic, faraway lands where your everyday problems and stress melt in the presence of true paradise. You want to go to there, and we want to go with you. Every day at 3 p.m. Eastern, we’ll send you a picture of the place we at Yahoo Travel are daydreaming about so we can all take that mental vacation together. Let’s go to… \nPhoto: Jack Versloot /Flickr \n…Saint Basil’s Cathedral!!! Add this to your “must-see” list STAT. Dating all the way back to 1561, St. Basil’s has been a staple of Moscow and a truly unforgettable sight. Located in Red Square, it is impossible to miss. With its onion domes and vibrant colors, it reminds us of something that you might see in a Tim Burton film. While this stunning cathedral may be the most iconic site in Moscow, there’s plenty else to see and do while you’re in town and with the ruble being weak and travel deals to be had, now is the perfect time to go. Any trip to Moscow would be incomplete without visits to The Kremlin, Tolstoy Estate-Museum, Gorky Park, The Gothic Room in Sanduny Baths, Art Muzeon sculpture garden, and the Red October Chocolate Factory.
