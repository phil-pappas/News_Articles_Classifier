U.S. officials had said in recent days that the Russians were flying reconnaissance missions without dropping bombs to familiarize themselves within the area. That was taken as an indication that they were about to begin airstrikes.\n ROBERT BURNS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T18:20:28.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
