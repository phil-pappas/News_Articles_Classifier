Ian Massingham, technical evangelist at Amazon Web Services (AWS), says: “IoT and cloud computing are a natural fit. By their very nature, IoT applications will require flexible infrastructure and resources. “We will see IoT projects starting small but, over time, as more and more devices get connected, these IoT projects will scale exponentially. Only the cloud has the ability to accommodate this growth, removing the potential pressure it will place on resources.” Cloud computing delivers on-demand IT resources via the internet, providing compute power, storage, databases, and other services as needed. This is a fundamental necessity for supporting this IoT phenomenon where millions of devices will be connected to the internet to collect and share information. “Traditionally scaling to cope with this type of trend would have required that businesses make massive investment to build out their IT infrastructure. But this is not a requirement for those using the cloud to support their IoT applications. They can acquire and pay for the infrastructure on demand, meaning the only barrier to what’s possible is their imagination.” To help start-ups and businesses that want to build IoT products in the cloud, AWS is running an IoT lab, sponsored by Intel at its Pop-up Loft in London open until 29 October. At the lab there will be several IoT technology demos and guests will be able to participate in Q&A opportunities with the AWS technical team where they can learn more about IoT application architectures and understand the possibilities of IoT in the cloud. Massingham says: “A good example of a customer we have got in this space is Centrica’s connected home product, Hive. At the moment it is mostly used for remotely controlling heating and thermostats, but in the future Centrica intends to extend it to other areas such as home automation. “It is a service that Centrica built on the AWS platform. It was originally an experimental service, but is something that has been widely adopted by their customers.” Home automation is an area that AWS is also working on with other companies. Philips is using AWS to connect its Hue lighting IoT system to the cloud, enabling users to access their lights through smart devices. But the biggest growth area for the IoT, Massingham believes, is the industrial sector. Many of the changes brought about by the IoT have been subtle, but there are many examples where this technology trend is changing our world. Phillips CityTouch is one. It is an intelligent light management system that allows entire suburbs and cities to actively control their streetlights in real time. Another example is cleaning solutions provider Karcher. Through internet-enabled machinery, it utilises data to keep tabs on usage and health of the machines, enabling more effective maintenance and innovative new business models. This is just a sign of what is to come. We are still at the beginning of the IoT phenomenon. Over the next few years we will see millions and millions of devices connect to the internet, everything from watches and lights to cars, lifts and industrial machinery.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:54:33.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
