The award was presented at the 2015 HPN Global Annual Conference in New Orleans. ACCESS is the first DMC to receive this award. \nHPN Global developed the award in 2010 in an effort to recognize suppliers who demonstrate true strategic partnership. Jil Dasher, Vice President, Meeting Services, HPN Global expressed, “The nomination process is purely peer-driven and it was clear to us that we needed to add the DMC sector of our business to our awards category. ACCESS has set the bar high as a strategic partner. They’ve become an integral partner for HPN by delivering outstanding, timely service time and time again.” ACCESS’ newest office, ACCESS New Orleans, sponsored and produced a very successful “Club HPN” event at this year’s Annual Conference. Stacey Crivello, ACCESS Account Director, shared “HPN Global is so much more than a client to ACCESS. We truly consider them a strategic partner in every sense, so to be recognized by them for that partnership is such an honor.” Over the past 12 months, ACCESS has been making headlines with numerous awards including making the Inc 5000 Fastest Growing Companies list for the third consecutive year, winning the Shining Star award for CSR programming for the second consecutive year at Pharma Forum, and being named as one the Top 25 DMCs.
