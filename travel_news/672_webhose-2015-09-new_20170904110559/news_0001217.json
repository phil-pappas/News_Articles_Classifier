I say “strangest”, but I possibly mean “most humiliating”. A friend had somehow wrangled tickets for four of us for Ladies Day at Ascot – not only that, but to the Royal Enclosure. Naturally, we decided to make the most of the occasion. The men hired top hats and tails, and we splashed out on the poshest frocks we could afford. We also pulled out all the stops on creating a picnic luncheon fit for the occasion too. My contribution was a lovingly homemade trout mousse, which I had carefully decanted into a glass container. Unfortunately we couldn’t get hold of a proper picnic hamper – meaning my mousse was balanced rather precariously in my handbag. Our attempts to blend in with the great and good didn’t extend to our mode of transport... Our attempts to blend in with the great and good didn’t extend to our mode of transport – and instead we all piled into the old family car. It’s hardly a long drive from London to Ascot, after all. Predictably, just as we approached Windsor, the car broke down. As we stood on the side of the road waiting for the AA in all our finery – high heels, vibrant dresses, flamboyant hats and all – we became a source of much amusement and entertainment for every passing car. Wolf whistles, cheers, boos… and from those also obviously also headed to Ascot, cries of “Jolly bad luck!” and “I’d give you a lift but we’re all full up…” Eventually, the breakdown truck arrived. The mechanic, once he stopped laughing, took pity on us – and offered to give us a lift to the racecourse. As we disembarked with as much dignity as we could muster, every head in the place turned... If anyone is wondering how best to make an impression at the Royal Enclosure at Ascot, wonder no longer. Simply arrive on the back of a tow truck. As we disembarked with as much dignity as we could muster, every head in the place turned towards us. Some recognised us from the side of the road and laughed and applauded – everyone else just gawped. And that’s when my ultra-posh trout mousse made its own entrance. The step down from the breakdown truck was too much for it, and, in full view of the cream of British society, it fell, smashed and… bounced. “Too much gelatine, old girl,” shouted someone. The laughter could probably be heard back in London. As told to Dominic Utton • Whether you're dressed in top hats and tails or jeans and a jumper, it's never fun to breakdown on the motorway. With the AA on your side, you're covered no matter what happens.
