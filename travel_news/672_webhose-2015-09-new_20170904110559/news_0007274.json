In Victoria’s wine-centric Yarra Valley, about an hour’s drive from Melbourne, the Eastern Golf Club will open 27 holes in view of the Dividing Range mountains when finished in mid-October. Already, several are open to play, and though the course is private, nonmembers staying at nearby resorts, including Yering Gorge Cottages, Chateau Yering and Stones in the Yarra Valley, have access to it. Room rates start at 299 Australian dollars ($220) and green fees begin at 95 dollars ($70), including a golf cart.\nSNOWMOBILE SAFARIS IN WYOMING\nIn Transit Travel news, deals and tips, written by the editors and reporters of the Travel section.
