The property recently expanded to include a main lodge with five guest rooms, a more private two-bedroom chalet, a three-bedroom beach house and the six-bedroom Fishmaster’s Inn that includes its own kitchen, a dining area and a wrap-around deck. The main lodge features plenty of space for recreation, including rooms with dartboards and a pool table as well as television and reading rooms. Of course, the biggest draw to Elfin Cove is the fishing — packages offered at the resort vary in duration and cost, but all include round-trip air transportation from Juneau, professional guides, fish processing, fishing gear and full-service dining. Guests are also welcome to bring their own boats to fish without a guide, or to simply visit for the stellar views and wilderness without casting a line at all. PROGRESSIVE DINNERS GET HISTORICAL WITH JUNEAU FOOD TOURS THIS WINTER Beginning mid-December, Juneau Food Tours is introducing a special, prohibition-era-themed dinner tour. Guests are transported via limousine, led by a guide who will share extensive knowledge of the history of Juneau, specifically between 1920 and 1940. The first stop on the tour is a speakeasy at V’s Cellar Door , complete with staff dressed in period wear, for a cocktail and appetizers. Next, guests will walk down Seward Street to enjoy a main course and wine pairing at The Rookery Café while they learn about the history of the city. The final stop is at SALT for a cocktail and a specialty dessert. All tastings are exclusive to the tour, which runs between two and three hours and can accommodate a maximum of 10 participants. The tour is set to run Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays through the beginning of April. PACK CREEK BEAR TOURS INTRODUCES WILD NEW OFFERINGS Last month, Pack Creek Bear Tours added two new offerings for hopeful bear viewers in Alaska. The first package allows visitors touring the Southeast region in private and charter yachts to hire a guide to fly out and pick them up directly from their boats. The guides will fly guests to either Admiralty or Chichagof Island for a tour that can last anywhere from a few hours to a couple of days, depending on the preference of the group. Guests can also opt for a flightseeing tour on the way. The second new tour option is the Tongass Bear Country Tour on Chichagof Island, taking groups to a salmon watershed where fish have been running strong, providing an optimal feeding environment for bears. This tour requires about three miles of walking off the beaten path, but rewards participants with a wilderness adventure and the incredible opportunity to view bears in their natural habitat. Pack Creek Bear Tours offers guests incredible wildlife viewing and a 98-percent chance of spotting brown bears between the months of May and September. Guided by professional Alaska naturalists, the six-hour exploration tour through Pack Creek Bear Sanctuary is only about a 30-minute floatplane trip from Juneau, bringing visitors right into the heart of Alaska wilderness. ADVENTURE FLOW ADDS TWO NEW YEAR-ROUND TOURS The crew at Adventure Flow has been hard at work dreaming up ways to take its activities from summer specials to year-round mainstays. Two of its most popular offerings, adventure sailing and walking tours, have been adapted to offer fun throughout the entire winter season. Adventure sailing tours can accommodate up to six people and range from three to nine days with a completely customizable adventure level to include skiing if desired. Guides take guests aboard a sailboat and travel near backcountry ski areas all around Southeast Alaska, featuring incredible views and access to even better powder. For a more low-key adventure, guests can sail aboard the Adventure Flow sailboats to embark on walking tours of Southeast Alaska communities, visiting natural hot springs, fishing and enjoying gourmet cooking on the boat. Adventure Flow’s year-round walking tour of downtown Juneau is a great way for visitors to familiarize themselves with Alaska’s capital city through interactive, storytelling-based guidance. Participants receive headsets that allow them to listen to the audio tour, whether they stay with the group or choose to explore on their own.
