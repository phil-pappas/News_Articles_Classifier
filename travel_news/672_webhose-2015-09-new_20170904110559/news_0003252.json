With a few smart tips in mind, you can easily be ahead of the fashion curve and add a few extra inches to your height. Here’s how to dress wise: \n1 Go for slim fit: These make you look leaner and taller. Slim fit jeans or cigarette pants stretch the length of the legs visually. As for shirts, go for slim fit shirts and tuck them in. Leaving the shirt outside will give you a baggy look, making you look shorter. \n2 Choosing the right pattern: If you like wearing stripes, go for vertical stripes running across the fabric. This will give the illusion of a longer silhouette. If you are not too keen on stripes, go for ­patterns which are in line with your body type. Shorter guys should stick to smaller patterns. \n3 Colour combinations: Go for a dark and light colour combination. A pair of dark-coloured pants or jeans paired with light-coloured top will take away the attention from the shortness of your legs and make them look longer. But when it comes to jackets or coats, reverse the combination with brightly coloured bottoms and dark coloured jackets and coats. \n4 Monochromatic pattern: Streamline your look by ­sticking to one colour. Don’t mix and match too many colours. Uniformity in colours gives one an illusion of height. A colour palette of classic colours such as black, white, coal, brown, grey and olive green is most flattering for you. \n5 Layering: Layer your fabric at the right places to create the illusion of a leaner body. Layer a button down shirt with a fitted ­jacket or alternatively pair a T-shirt with a waist coat for a more casual look. \n6 Shoes: Avoid wearing sneakers or any flat-footed footwear, as they will only make you look short and squat. Go for sleek boots and pair them with slim fit jeans. Boots will make your legs look taller and proportionate. \n7 Short men should opt for peaked lapels when it comes to formal wear: A single lapelled ­jacket with peaks is ideal. If you go for a two-button, then a higher ­button stance always comes in handy. In terms of double breasted jackets, shorter men should stick to a single or two buttoned jacket with a 4/1 or 4/2 configuration. \n(With inputs by designer Angad Singh Malhotra) Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T13:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T18:42:03.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
