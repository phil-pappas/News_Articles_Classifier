There’s a lot of awareness now for ecotourism,” said Cabigao. \n\nNon-profit Gawad Kalinga (Give Care) founder, Tony Meloto, expects more voluntourists when they embark on the second phase of their social entrepreneur projects in 25 more sites. \n\nThe first phase, Enchanted Farm in Angat, Bulacan, has foreign volunteers staying several years to develop, teach and guide the communities to form their own livelihood programmes. \n\n“These are good examples of experiential tourism (and) community immersion,” said PHILTOA’s Cruz. “We’re still looking to include other community-based attractions but they have to pass our criteria involving safety and hygiene standards, especially in preparing and handling food.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T08:40:36.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
