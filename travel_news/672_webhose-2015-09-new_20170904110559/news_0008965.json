The destination hosts a variety of sporting events such as the IAAF World Relays earlier this year, the Popeyes Bahamas Bowl, the LPGA Silk Classic Tournament, and has established many important partnerships with sports teams such as the NBA’s Miami Heat. \nApproximately 85% of the visitors that come to The Bahamas are from the U.S. and many of them hail from the Florida market. As such, the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism (BMOT) has formed partnerships with some of the most influential sports entities in this area and has created and retained unique, authentic signature sporting events with them, with Miami Heat being one of the flagship teams. Signing a 5-year partnership contract in 2013, The Bahamas is playing host to a variety of Miami Heat events at the end of September in the lead-up to the beginning of the season. \nTo celebrate this partnership, The Bahamas will play host to The Miami Heat Assets. All-star Small Forward, Luol Deng, is spending three weeks training for the new season in The Bahamas from September 3 to 25. During that period, Deng will be joined by the Miami Heat Dancers from September 17-22, while Miami Heat Corporate partners will be in The Bahamas from October 1 to 4. \nTo mark this newest announcement, Greg Rolle, former Olympian, pilot and Senior Director of Sports and Sales for The Bahamas Ministry of Tourism said, “Sports are an integral part of Bahamian culture and transcends in all areas of life. Sporting events act as a bridge for people to connect, no matter their language. Partnering with the Miami Heat affords us the opportunity to connect with one of the most important and exciting teams in the NBA and share everything that The Bahamas has to offer with an even larger audience.” \n“The Bahamas Ministry of Tourism continues in its resolve to form strong strategic partnerships with leading sports organizations. We are proactive in ensuring that The Bahamas is known as the premier destination for sports tourism in the Caribbean. Working so successfully with Miami Heat has helped us tremendously,” he said. From basketball to track & field, from American football to golf and marathons, The Bahamas is gaining recognition as the premier sports destination not only in the Caribbean, but in the world, proving that it is much more than just beautiful sun, sand and sea. \nAbout The Islands Of The Bahamas \nThe Islands Of The Bahamas have a place in the sun for everyone from Nassau and Paradise Island to Grand Bahama to The Abaco Islands, The Exuma Islands, Harbour Island, Long Island and others.
