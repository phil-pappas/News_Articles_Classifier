So there has never been\na better time to travel for South Africans,” he says, pointing out that air tickets are\nconsiderably cheaper for both leisure and corporate travellers compared with last\nyear.\n“Yes, the strained economy has affected overall airline sales for Flight Centre Travel\nGroup, but packaged holidays are enjoying strong growth, which is very pleasing as\nthis benefits South African travel customers for now.”\nHe says that thanks to aggressive marketing and innovation, Flight Centre has seen\ngrowth in packaged, all-inclusive holidays to destinations like Mauritius and Thailand,\nand also domestically.\nHe says Flight Centre – which has launched scores of great deals to celebrate its\nbirthday, including free travel, accommodation and meals for children accompanying\nparents on holiday to Mauritius – is on a drive to “transform our image from a\ntraditional travel agent to a world-class travel retailer through our new customer-centric stores and our unique product offering in the marketplace, being lowest\nairfare guaranteed and Red Label Holidays”.\nSays Stark: “We saw a trend change coming, 15 months ago with a forecast of a\nweakening rand. We saw a gap to introduce our own unique product that would\nappeal to the South African traveling public. We conceptualised a brand called Red\nLabel Holidays, which is all about being unique to Flight Centre and offering value\nadd to travellers.\n“Red Label Holidays is comprised of three sub-brands, namely All in (hand-picked\nall-inclusive hotels and resorts); Family Fiesta (hand-picked family hotels and\nresorts); and Just for 2 (hand-picked couples’ hotels and resorts). We also hand-\npicked the three destinations that we believed the travelling public would find\nappealing down the line, which are Mauritius, Thailand and South Africa.\n“The success of this exclusive product, coupled with added value, has helped make\ntravel for South Africans all that more appealing and affordable. With the success of\nRed Label Holidays showing growth of 500% since its introduction, Flight Centre\nTravel Group’s strategy for the next five years will be to continue to develop unique\nproducts for customers to ensure that travel is always affordable for the South\nAfrican consumer.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:06:12.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
