Direct: Virgin Atlantic offer direct flights from London Heathrow to San Francisco\nBut Plunge and Westbridge, near Zephyr chair, were relaxing cruising runs, as well as the long, gentle, but rewarding piste down to Northstar village.\nIt was Northstar that guided me to my first-ever Heavenly ski experience. This is one of Lake Tahoe’s premier ski resorts and being on the north shore of Lake Tahoe, it’s closer to San Francisco (about four hours’ drive) and its international airport.\nThe resort’s ice-skating rink, with cosy fire pits all around, and choir in full song, is the village centrepiece bringing a lot of warmth to early-season, chilly nights in the Sierra mountains.\nI confess that most of the warmth came from the rink-side Cabana bar which serves up a Northstar ‘classic’ cocktail called ‘the dirty snowman’, which mixes hot cocoa, vanilla vodka, Irish cream and hazelnut liqueor.\nNeed I say more?\nIf staying, as we did, at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel on the mountain above Northstar village, with its ski-in, ski-out access and own village gondola, then the word ‘more’ is spoken often, and with respect.\nMore the word ‘s’more’ in fact – the name of the biscuit sandwich, filled with chocolate and marshmallow – yes you’ve guessed it, once you’ve tried one, you have to have s’more!\nThe Ritz-Carlton has taken the s’more concept to another level by employing its own ‘marshmologist’ to keep up the sticky standards and by offering them free after you return from the slopes.\nAway from the Ritz-Carlton, I can also recommend the Lake Tahoe Resort Hotel.\nIt’s slightly closer to the Heavenly gondola, has spacious rooms (no fireplaces though) and an apres-ski Happy Two Hours when cocktails, beers, wine and pretzels are not cut price, but free! What s’more can I say...\nTRAVEL FACTS Virgin Holidays ( virginholidays.co.uk , 0844 557 3859) offers seven nights including one at the Hotel Zephyr in San Francisco’s Fisherman’s Wharf, three at The Ridge At Tahoe and three nights at own arrangement, with return flights from Heathrow to San Francisco and car hire from £849pp.\nRead more: All Inclusive & Package Holidays | Virgin Holidays", "external_links": ["http://virginholidays.co.uk/", "http://dailym.ai/1OuE2ju"], "published": "2015-09-23T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T03:46:33.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
