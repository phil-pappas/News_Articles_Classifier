More than 100 people around the state contribute to updating the map, which provides the percentage of peak color and the week the trees are expected to reach their peak in each county. \nThe map also includes links to nearby lodging, dining and events, plus scenic drives and activities. \nAccording to the map, fall colors are expected to peak in northern Wisconsin between the last week in September and the first week of October, and move south to reach peak in the Milwaukee area by the third week of October. \nTravelers can sign up for a weekly Fall Color Report email, sent every Thursday, or text \"WI Fall\" to 468311 to receive alerts. The map is viewable anytime online at travelwisconsin.com/fall-color-report . Free entrance to national parks \nFourth-graders can access national parks, forests, wildlife refuges and more for free during the 2015-'16 school year, thanks to the Every Kid in a Park initiative from the National Park Foundation. \nStudents can download and print passes from everykidinapark.gov . The passes are good through Aug. 31, 2016, and provide access to more than 2,000 sites for the fourth-grader and three accompanying adults (or an entire car for drive-in parks). \nThe pass is not valid for extra-fee activities such as camping, special tours and ferries. \nPark visitors age 62 and older get free admission to national parks on Oct. 8 during Humana's Senior Skip Day. The health care company is a sponsor of Find Your Park, a celebration of the National Park Service's centennial in 2016. \nEveryone can get into national parks for free on the year's remaining entrance fee-free dates: Sept. 26 (National Public Lands Day) and Nov. 11 (Veterans Day). \nWhile Wisconsin is not home to any national parks, Badger State-travelers can visit the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, the Ice Age National Scenic Trail, the North Country National Scenic Trail, the St. Croix National Scenic Riverway and a number of national wildlife refuges. \nâ€”Chelsey Lewis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T19:30:12.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
