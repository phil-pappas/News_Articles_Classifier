The light at the beginning and end of a day highlights the magic of this magnificent site. \nDon’t bother: Spending more than a day or two in Lima. Cuzco, the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu have much more to offer. \nCoolest souvenir: Dried gourd carved and painted in the shape of a cuy (guinea pig). \nWorth a splurge: Have lunch at Astrid & Gaston and/or Central Restaurante in Lima. These restaurants were recently rated No. 14 and No. 4 in the world, respectively. \nWish I’d packed: A small towel to use after washing up from a sweaty and dusty day on the trail. \nOther comments: The Inca Trail, the many ruins along the way, and of course Machu Picchu are testaments to the genius of the Inca.
