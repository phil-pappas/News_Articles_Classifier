Around 500 miles, this route is not as rugged as some but more than makes up for this with the atmosphere created by walkers of all ages from all parts of the world. No other walk has the same infrastructure to support tens of thousands of walkers. We walked this route from St Jean Pied de Porte to Santiago de Compostela in Spain, as we turned 60 years of age. Walking every day in spring, carrying all our needs in small rucksacks, with no accommodation booked, realised in us the value of the few necessities in life: our health, a bed for the night, a place to wash bodies and clothes, nourishing food provided by welcoming hosts, the friendship and companionship of fellow walkers met along the way. It took 33 days – one for each year of Christ’s life on earth. Was that a coincidence? This walk can safely be undertaken by everyone, though is more enjoyable with some fitness preparation beforehand. For us it was an unforgettable experience: we would heartily recommend it.

There, behind the impressive stone arch, we came across row upon row of well tended graves, moving and amusing tributes to a beloved monkey, famous film star dog Rin Tin Tin, a lion, rabbits, birds and hundreds of cats and dogs – all honoured with headstones which are quirky, elaborate and very fitting. This is a beautiful testament to the joy and love a pet can bring and provides an insight into the heart of the Parisian pet lover. Bridget Mellor Food for thought Further to the Peregrinations column (“ Culinary lessons from Luton airport ”, September 5), the truth is that French food is grossly overrated while British food is grossly underrated. That is the main difference between the two. Comment posted online Southern spirit Following a trip to the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia, I read with pleasure “Journey to the soul of the South” (cover story, September 5). Paul Theroux’s tale of Vicksburg – a town too beautiful to burn in the American Civil War – can’t hold a candle to my mother’s family story. Her great-grandmother managed to put out the flames of their Virginia homestead after Northern troops on the march torched it. On return, the commander swore, “I’ve already burned this house once. This time I’ll stay until it’s ash.” The spirit and soul of the South is worth a visit. Brits venture forth to view the colours of autumn in the north-east but the maple flames of the Appalachians, running through Virginia and the Carolinas are set to be gorgeous this season. Before leaving Appalachia, my husband and I took a stroll up to Lover’s Leap and ran into two old Southern woman out for their weekly constitutional. They had walked into Carolina from Tennessee. When we asked which road to follow, they looked at us hard and slow. “Depends how long you’all fixin’ to be here.” Nigel Bagnall Canada ETA After reading that an Electronic Travel Authorisation will be required to enter Canada from March 15 next year ( Travel news , August 29), my husband decided to apply immediately, thereby avoiding the inevitable rush early next year. We were not amused to see that the Authorisation is dated from the day we applied and not March 15 2016 [ETA’s are valid for five years]. As it cannot be used between now and next March we feel that we have been penalised by six months. Shirley Bridges Plane speaking Planes are often not clean (“ Dishing the dirt on plane hygiene ”, September 5). The problem is, especially for budget carriers, the necessary fast turnaround (as low as 40 minutes) – there isn’t the time to sanitise everything from the passengers alighting. If you are concerned about it, carry a pack of Dettol wet wipes in your hand luggage, they are cheap but 100 per cent effective.
