The state-of-the-art Spa, measuring nearly 3,000 square metres , includes 14 treatment rooms, spacious wet areas and relaxation facilities, sun-lit lap pool, hair salon, nail bar and 24-hour Fitness Centre.\nAmnis, translating from Latin as “the flowing of water” or “stream,” is committed to creating unique experiences within this refuge of relaxation. Conceived as an oasis of calm in the heart of busy Moscow, away from the city’s bustling streets, Amnis Spa provides a soothing and nurturing environment in which guests can begin their personal journey to physical and spiritual harmony.\nLocated on the fifth floor, this chic Spa is full of daylight and offers 14 treatment rooms including three couple suites; a lap pool of 18 x 6 metres (60 x 20 feet) located in a glass-covered central courtyard; and separate male and female spa areas that include Finnish saunas, steam baths, cold plunge pools, hydrotherapy baths, relaxation areas and lifestyle showers with chromotherapy feature. The 24-hour high-tech Fitness Centre features Life Fitness equipment, including weight-resistance machines and a variety of cardio stations with individual TVs. The pool area, beautifully decorated in constructivist style, offers its guests an adjoining heated whirlpool and a poolside Amnis Café serving a superfoods menu.\nTreatments at Amnis Spa\nThe exquisite high-end skincare brands at Amnis Spa have been selected for their rare qualities and ability to soothe all beauty and relaxation needs. The thoughtfully developed treatments focus on relaxation and rejuvenation for leisure and business travellers in this ever-vibrant city.\nTHÉMAÉ, a French professional spa brand that uses the acclaimed benefits of tea and places them in the heart of each formula, is represented by its star range that contains the prized Four Teas Elixir. Russia’s deeply rooted tea traditions are now revived in this unique form of relaxation to achieve well-being through nature-inspired ingredients. THÉMAÉ body balms are used in the majority of Amnis Spa massages, leaving skin deeply nourished and hydrated.\nInspired by the healing powers of Hungary’s famous thermal baths, this internationally acclaimed Omorovicza brings guests back in time to when Russians considered bathing in mineral-rich waters the most efficient way to rejuvenate and cure all diseases. Enlisting the help of a prize-winning team of scientists, Omorovicza developed Hydro Mineral Transference, a delivery system that enables the absorption of minerals from the healing waters of Budapest by the epidermis for firmer, suppler and younger-looking skin. The products are originally from Hungary and are rich in natural ingredients, with no parabens and synthetics. Today available exclusively in Four Seasons Hotel Moscow are the Gold Hydrating Facial Ritual and Lake Heviz Journey body treatment by Omorovicza.\nDr Burgener, the Swiss expert in anti-ageing treatments, was chosen specifically for its visible anti-ageing effect and rejuvenation on cellular level. The alliance between high technology and natural ingredients in the products designed by Dr. Pauline Burgener offers guests of Amnis Spa excellence in the most advanced cosmetology of the day. Among the range are Vitaskin, a treatment combining ultrasound and galvanic technologies, and Diamond Dermabrasion by Dr Burgener – two unique facial cures created by the brand for Amnis Spa.\nSource:-Four Seasons Hotel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T18:09:22.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
