Having a large traveler catchment area, attractive resorts and a healthy regional economy are no longer enough,\" said Alfredo González, vice president of global meetings, trade and market development for Visit Florida, while moderating a panel discussion. \nMr. González continued: “Airlines today are in the risk management business and we need to match their thinking if we are to attract their business. The risks facing airlines are immense and diverse, from operational and financial to political and procurement.\" \nTo attract vital new airline routes, tourist boards and airports need to get in step with airlines’ own risk management outlook and offer them greater risk-sharing opportunities through closer partnerships was one of the major issues being discussed at the World Routes Strategy Summit in Durban, South Africa, where the heads of major airlines, airports and tourist boards have gathered to debate the key themes affecting aviation and tourism development globally. \n“Airlines globally have taken a multi-billion dollar bet in their latest fleet orders, with thousands of new aircraft entering service in the next several years. These aircraft can be deployed anywhere, so it falls to destinations and airports to make a convincing case to airlines that we can help offset their risks. Perhaps more than any other factor, a destination’s sophistication in risk management will determine how successful it is in attracting visitor traffic in the coming decade,” Mr. Gonzalez added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T23:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T00:26:29.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
