Other engine manufacturers have had uncontained engine failures. \n\"Most of the time you get an engine failure the casing does contain the effects but sometimes it doesn't. \n\"It's an issue of balance. You could make it twice as thick and twice as heavy, but air fares would go up and more fuel would be used. \n\"You could make it like a tank but it wouldn't get off the ground.\" \nOne of the most serious incidents of an uncontained engine failure involved a Qantas London to Sydney superjumbo in November 2010 with 440 passengers on board. \nRolls-Royce admitted it had ''clearly fallen short'' of the highest standards following the dramatic disintegration of its engine, forcing the Airbus A380 to make an emergency landing shortly after take-off following a refuelling stop at Singapore. \nAn investigation into another emergency found that aircraft technicians for a flight which was forced to conduct an emergency landing in May 2013 at Heathrow might have been fatigued. \nThe BA Airbus A319 returned to the airport with smoke billowing from one of its engines, minutes into its flight to Oslo, Norway. \nThe Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) report said doors on both engines had been left unlatched during maintenance. \nThe aircraft suffered a punctured fuel pipe and a fire in the right engine. \nBA issued a statement which said the Las Vegas incident happened after the plane ''experienced a technical issue''. \nThe aircraft was travelling between 40 and 100mph ahead of the 10-hour flight to Gatwick when the captain slammed the brakes on. \nTwenty-seven people, including all crew members, were taken to hospital with minor injuries, mostly caused by sliding down the inflatable chutes to escape. \nBA would not reveal how many of the passengers were British, although the Las Vegas to Gatwick route is popular with UK leisure travellers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T10:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T03:22:54.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
