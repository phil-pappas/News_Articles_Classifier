So, we have planned an eight-day trip to Srinagar... flight tickets are booked and we are heading to Srinagar on December 29 and returning to Kolkata on Jan 5. I have also reserved a room at Club Mahindra houseboats in Srinagar for these eight days. Its Mahindra's new-ish acquisition and there are no reviews to be found anywhere. These are my questions: - I know it will be freezing, but what are the chances of seeing snowfall in Sringar city during these days. Is a white New Year guaranteed? - Will staying in a Houseboat for eight days be uncomfortable? It's a Mahindra property, so i dont think it will be bad as far as facilities are concerned. Should I book a traditional hotel for a few days? - Any help with the itinerary will be appreciated.
