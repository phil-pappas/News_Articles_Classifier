Previously, baristas had been paid £6.77 an hour.

Franchisees will be able to decide whether to mirror the company policy. \nLast week Lidl, the discount retailer, said it would start paying its UK staff a “living wage” of at least £8.20 an hour from October, while employees in London would earn £9.35. \nMr Engskov declined to say how much Starbucks’ increase would cost the company, and said the coffee chain was “supportive” of the government’s goal for pay of £9.35 an hour by 2020. \n“It is a big investment. I will not go into the financial numbers but this is about the competition. If you look, this is the most competitive retail market in the world and the most competitive coffee market in the world and it is increasingly difficult to find great people,” he said. \nStarbucks also said it would begin offering its staff interest-free loans in order to pay rent deposits. After polling employees, Mr Engskov said the biggest issue facing them was housing. “That is no surprise. People are working in cities and not being able to afford housing close to where they work,” he said. \nThe loans will be repayable over a 12-month period, he said, adding that he expected them to be extremely popular. \nEarlier this month, Whitbread , the owner of Costa Coffee, said it expected to cut spending and increase prices to offset the “substantial” cost of the new minimum wage. The company said it would reveal further details at its half-year results on October 20. \nStarbucks has been heavily criticised for paying millions in royalties and interest from its UK operations to other Starbucks companies overseas in order to lower its tax bill. A Reuters investigation in 2012 showed how Starbucks had made cumulative sales of more than £3bn since it opened in the UK but paid only £8.6m of corporation tax.
