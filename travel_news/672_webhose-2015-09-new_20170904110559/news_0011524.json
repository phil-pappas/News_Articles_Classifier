For some, letting loose may refer to bringing home the occasional hotel towel or robe—for others, it may be stretching the truth a little bit when on vacation (i.e. \"We're celebrating our honeymoon!\"). Trip-planning website Hipmunk surveyed 1,000 travelers to dig into the most common activities that make a \"good traveler gone bad.\" From skinny-dipping in the hotel room to stealing extra toiletries, here are a few highlights. (Don't miss the full infographic on Hipmunk !)\nEarly Boarding\nAccording to the survey, six percent of takers sneak on an airplane before their boarding group has been announced. Rebels.\nLean Back\nFifty-four percent of those surveyed confessed to reclining their seats mid-flight. If that's wrong, we don't want to be right.\nNot-So Free Food\nA whopping sixty percent of the surveyed travelers admitted to sneaking food from the hotel breakfast bar.\nSecret Stowaways\nThirty-seven percent of participants have snuck in an extra guest in their room overnight without telling the hotel. You know what they say, the more the merrier.\nTurning Vacation Into a Celebration\nWhen it comes to sharing the reason behind their vacations, ten percent of survey takers admit to stretching the truth a bit in order to take advantage of special upgrades.\nErika Owen is the Audience Engagement Editor at Travel + Leisure.
