To qualify and receive a designation in the program, facilities must implement numerous environmental practices in communication and education (customers, employees and public); waste reduction (reusing and recycling); water conservation; energy efficiency; and indoor air quality.\nThe state has praised the Fort Myers resort for efforts that include installing a trash compactor and cardboard separator, adding an electric car charging station, implementing nature programs with an on-site master naturalist, planting 10,000 plants on the beach to prevent erosion and hosting a water conservation community event. Pink Shell also recycles all paper, glass, cardboard, electronics, cooking oil and batteries while boasting a green team that meets once a month to discuss ongoing initiatives.\n\"We are extremely passionate about improving our environmental footprint and constantly looking to find new eco-friendly practices to utilize,\" said Alicia Wiley , general manager of Pink Shell Beach Resort & Marina. \"We are proud of our 2 Palm status and hope our efforts serve as an inspiration to other properties in the area and beyond.\"\nLocated along 12 beautiful acres across the Gulf of Mexico , the Fort Myers Beach hotel is dedicated to protecting its surroundings. In addition to the sugary-white sand beach, the property boasts a 41-slip marina on Estero Bay, ranked in the Top 25 Places to Tie Up in North America .\nWhen not enjoying the stunning outdoors, travelers are invited to retreat to one- and two-bedroom condo-style suites that incorporate eco-friendly practices while providing all of the comforts of home.\nAbout Pink Shell Beach Resort & Marina\nPink Shell Beach Resort & Marina at 275 Estero Blvd. in Fort Myers, FL sits along a quarter mile of sugary-white sands with 213 beachfront studio and condo-style accommodations overlooking the Gulf of Mexico , the barrier islands of South West Florida , Sanibel and Captiva.
