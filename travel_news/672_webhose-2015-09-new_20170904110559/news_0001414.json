We’re especially proud as the Red61 team have also been running the Fringe Society’s ticketing operation since 2009.\n“It is a phenomenal event to be a part of working with the Fringe Society and many of the fantastic venues across the Fringe. The vast number of people the Fringe pulls into Scotland is obviously great for the economy, but it also allows Scottish companies to demonstrate what they can deliver and that is exactly what has happened for us.\n“Festival and event organisers come from all over the globe to participate or just to enjoy the Fringe and other Edinburgh festivals, and many of them have been so impressed by what we do on such a vast scale that they have asked us to replicate it for them.\n“We are now looking to open an office in Australia to cope with the amount of business there. We provide the ticketing solution for South Africa and Canada’s largest arts and cultural festivals and we are expecting to begin similar projects in other territories later this year.”\nRed61 have been working with Fringe venues since 2005 and now have 15 Edinburgh Fringe clients with the Fringe Society joining the network in 2009. People can now buy or collect tickets for shows from those 15 clients at any of the 47 sites in the Red61 ticketing network, which is the largest in the UK.\nThe real genius behind the success is the VIA Ticketing System. Red61 was founded in 2002 to build VIA, which is the brainchild of Tony and his business partner, software developer Peter McNaught.\nTony continued: “I worked in the event & ticketing industry before we started Red61 and realised that there wasn’t another ticketing solution that can do what the Edinburgh Fringe needs. I knew that if we could satisfy the Fringe requirements, we could do anything.\n“One of the unique facets of the software is that multiple VIA servers can talk to each other which enables us to cope with the huge demands of scale and geography and makes the network extremely resilient against server downtime.\n“VIA’s ability to communicate with other VIA servers also provides a powerful tool with which clients can collaborate with other venues, ticket sellers and media partners. The whole aim is to make it easy to get your tickets out there through multiple channels, and make it easy for people to find information and make a purchase.”\nSource:-Edinburgh Festival", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:26:19.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
