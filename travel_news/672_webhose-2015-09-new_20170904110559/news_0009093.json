And it’s not a flavor of the month, but one I’ve been playing since 2012. I’m talking about The Simpsons: Tapped Out by Electronic Arts.[caption id=\"attachment_48\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] The Simpsons: Tapped Out for iOS and Android (Credit: Electronic Arts)[/caption] The Simpsons: Tapped Out is one of the most successful mobile games both in terms of downloads and profitability, and one of those titles that inspires game developers to keep chasing the lucrative iOS and Android market. In its first year (when the game was only available for Apple devices), it had spent all but 12 days on the Top 20 list of top grossing iPhone games in the United States and generated over $100 million in revenue for EA. Not bad for a game that’s free to play.Of course if EA is hauling in the cash like that on a free game, then it’s obviously a “freemium” game. That it is. As befits a game centered around the antics of Homer Simpson, the in-game currency is donuts. While you are never forced to spend real cash to buy them, it can be awfully tempting. It takes me a few months to earn 50 Donuts the hard way, but EA will happily sell me a tray of 132 for $11.99 (in Canadian dollars). There are plenty of other options from a dozen to a “Boatload” of 2,400. Clearly, plenty of players shell out for those donuts.But I’m getting ahead of myself.. Premise Homer accidentally causes a meltdown at the Springfield nuclear plant, wiping the town off the map. It’s up to you to rebuild the city from scratch, adding characters, buildings and decorations as you go. There’s a lot of tapping, a little bit of city planning a la Sim City and social interaction through the ability to visit and interact with your friends’ Springfields.[youtubevid id=\"bh25dscAq9g\"] Gameplay Send your characters to do jobs or fulfill tasks to earn money and experience points. Money lets you buy more stuff, experience points let you level up to earn donuts and unlock further levels. Donuts can used to speed up tasks or to buy premium characters, buildings and decorations.EA has recognized that farming and mining can get old fast, so characters have tasks of different durations. You can send them off for 30 seconds, 24 hours or other options. That makes it convenient to schedule the “tapping” around your day and also send everyone off to do stuff while you sleep. EA has made it even easier with a recent feature (tied to the Office of Unemployment) that that lets you automatically send everyone off on a job for a given duration, with a single click.Collectibles, objects and buildings (especially seasonal ones) can become clutter over time, but you can sell them or put them in storage for later use.[caption id=\"attachment_50\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] It's Krustyland! (Credit: Electronic Arts)[/caption]You do need to have a network connection to play the game. In the early days, this led to some frustrating moments when EA’s servers couldn’t handle the load. However, they’ve addressed that issue and it’s been a long time since I’ve had a problem there. If you’re going to play on the go, that does mean you’ll be using mobile data, although I don’t find it demanding except for those times when an update needs to be downloaded. Authenticity and Freshness One of the reasons The Simpsons: Tapped Out has been so successful --and continues to be popular when so many other games have flamed out after a few months-- is its authenticity. If you like the TV show, you’re going to like the game. Multiple writers for The Simpsons work on The Simpsons: Tapped Ou t, ensuring the dialog and quests in the game match the humor of the show. Character voices are largely done by the same voice actors as their TV counterparts (although the speaking parts are limited to catch-phrases), while EA and Fox have done multiple tie-ins between current TV show episodes and the game. The app is not above mocking itself, or the entire freemium business model, either.EA also invests in regular updates. Just as a particular theme like Halloween, or Clash of Clones (a Clash of Clans parody) starts to wear thin, something new is introduced. The game has even seen several expansions, including Krustyland and most recently, Springfield Heights.At the moment, I’m busy collecting track pieces after the monorail was unlocked. And yeah, I haven’t quite gotten around to tidying up that corner of my Springfield...[caption id=\"attachment_49\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] The Springfield Monorail (Credit: screen capture by Brad Moon).[/caption] Graphics The Simpsons: Tapped Out looks great. It’s a virtual clone of the TV show animation, dominated by primary colors. HD graphics mean everything is nicely sharp. Characters are always on the move and tapping them or some of the decorations will often trigger a unique response. There’s enough going on that it’s more suited to playing on a tablet than a smartphone (especially as your Springfield grows in size), but I frequently use my iPhone 6 --it’s easy to swipe around then zoom in on a character or building as needed. Final Word The Simpsons: Tapped Out isn’t a particularly demanding game and that’s one of the reasons I enjoy it. That and the fact that I’m a fan of The Simpsons . EA’s commitment to the game --including releasing new content, characters and quests on a monthly basis during the entire three year run of the game-- has also gone a long way toward keeping this game fresh.If you’re looking for a casual game for your iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch or Android device and appreciate all things Springfield, then you can’t go wrong with the free-to-play The Simpsons: Tapped Out . You can get intense about it for a few hours at a time if your wish, optimizing your Springfield’s layout; or you can send everyone off for day and forget about it without falling behind. It's truly a \"casual\" game.
