Though jet-lagged, the lady tourist exulted that she had finally arrived in exotic India! Her father who had served in India when the country was ruled by the Brits, had filled her head with stories about Kiplingesque jungles, the wondrous Taj Mahal and palaces crammed with untold riches.\nShe told us, \"As they say, there are two types of people in the world - those who have been to India and those who haven't!\" And then added: \"And those who have been to India can be segmented into two types: those who love India and those who just cannot handle the surprises the country throws at them.\"\nYes, India has a way of springing pleasant and unpleasant surprises on our foreign guests. Twenty-year-old Oliver had an unusual welcome, when he arrived in India recently. Stones were thrown at his car en route from Mumbai airport, by stray urchins. \"Initially, I thought it was a traditional Indian welcome,\" he joked. We met him at a luxury tented camp and spa close to the medieval city of Jaisalmer. Over the next few days, Oliver was slowly seduced by the flaring sunsets and sunrises in the burnt-orange desert; the twitter of birds outside his tent at daybreak; the sight of a camel caravan loping away in the distance with charpoy rope beds balancing on their accommodating humps; the contours and colour of the golden Jaisalmer Fort.\nThe wildlife lure \nAt the luxurious Jawai Leopard Camp, situated in the Aravalli Hills, 30 km away from Ranakpur, in western Rajasthan, we met Peter and Christine who were on their eighth visit to India! They loved the camp's minimalist design, the magical rocky landscape that unfolded around it and where leopards lurked. They walked with the red-turbaned Rabari herdsmen who shepherd their goats home at dusk, clucking to them like they were their children and marvelled at the simplicity of a nomadic lifestyle, devoid of want and greed.\nWe chatted with two other American women whose husbands had opted to go to Las Vegas rather than India! The ladies were in Ranthambore Tiger Reserve and they saw the majestic tiger in the wild, they felt that their trip to India had fulfiled their wildest dreams.\n\nStrange fantasies \nOn another occasion, we sat around a camp fire at Sher Bagh, where we met another couple. The wife was an ardent Indophile and the husband had decided to indulge her by using his frequent flier miles to fly her to India on a magical trip. Ever since she had read the tales of Rudyard Kipling as a child, India and elephants had fascinated her. Indeed she had an over-riding desire to hug an elephant. When she rode one en route to the magnificent Amber Fort in Jaipur, it was the high point of her trip. But then when she slid off her caparisoned perch and told the mahout that she wanted to 'cuddle' his elephant, he sensibly suggested that she hug his trunk instead. Later he took the couple to the elephant's stable and allowed her to help scrub and bathe the pachyderm in a pond nearby.\nYes, India has a way of fulfilling the strangest and most fugitive of fantasies in the most extraordinary ways!\n(You can read more stories on www.gustaspandjeroo.com) \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T06:23:46.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
