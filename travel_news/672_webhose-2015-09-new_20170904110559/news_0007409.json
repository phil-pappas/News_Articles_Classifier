The exhibition, on display through November 2015, is a contemporary artistic response to the culture of Japan’s Neolithic period and features work by multiple artists in a variety of mediums including clay, 3-D printing and acrylic painting. The Terminal Gallery features video work and a site-specific mural to celebrate the ties between Japan and Colorado made possible through United’s nonstop service between Tokyo and Denver.\nAccording to Curator Taketo Kobayashi, Arts of Jomon will expose visitors to a fascinating time in Japanese history. The Jomon era lasted around 10,000 years (approximately 10,500 to 300 BCE) and is considered to be one of the oldest recorded cultures in the world. A variety of contemporary artists have responded to ancient pottery and figures in a modern way. In addition, viewers are invited to observe the similarities between Native American culture, a rich aspect of Colorado’s history and Jomon culture.\nIn addition to the exhibition at DIA, several of the artists were in town creating a mural for the City of Denver’s Urban Arts Fund in August. In September, this exhibit ties into live performances titled, Mystical Abyss, a multidisciplinary work inspired by Japanese and Iroquois creation myths. Part dance, part theatre, part computer generated animation, Mystical Abyss is presented by Theatre of Yugen in association with Cleo Parker Robinson Dance with generous support from the National Endowment for the Arts and United Airlines.\nCurator Taketo Kobayashi Statement\nAlthough Jomon is a Japanese culture, this is also a universal message of peace for all the world. This culture lasted such a long time because it was based on sharing and tolerance.\nSource:- Denver International Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T10:42:04.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
