Before long the holiday season will be in full swing with parties and get-togethers being planned. The Hardwood Flooring Store wants homeowners to know a few basic tips to protect their hardwood floors in Toronto homes during this busy season.\n\nThe increase in traffic also increases the chance of damage. Since most entertaining involves food or at least drinks the risk of damage increases. The Hardwood Flooring Store wants homeowners to know what potential problems to look for and how to prevent many issues before they occur to ensure their hardwood floors continue to look like new.\n\nMoisture is one of the worst culprits for damage to a wood floor. Homeowners should ensure that door mats are in use and a location has been created for wet boots and clothing so that it doesnt drip on the floors. They should also be proactive in cleaning up spills as quickly as possible before the stain sets in.\n\nAnother concern for hardwood floors is scratches and dents. If people are dressed up for a formal occasion they may wear high heels which can create small dents in the floor. Scratches may occur if people slide their chairs. Place pads under the furniture or attach rubber covers to the legs of the chairs to help prevent scratches.\n\nAs careful as a homeowner can be not all spills and scratches can be prevented especially if they like to entertain. The Hardwood Flooring Store wants homeowners to know that many of these problems can be easily repaired by sanding and staining. Slight indentations and scratches will only require a light sanding. It is also important to sand the area of a floor that has had a spill resulting in discoloration before re-staining.\n\n\"If you arent sure what to do with your floor damage talk to a flooring professional\" says Ron Ander of The Hardwood Flooring Store a hardwood flooring company in Toronto. \"Anyone who sells hardwood flooring should be able to tell you how to maintain it and how to repair it.\"\nAnder advises making a consultation the first step in your floor repair to prevent further damage. Using the wrong products or repair methods can make the problem worse instead of fixing it. In many cases homeowners can make the small repairs themselves but they should hire a professional for bigger issues or if they dont feel confident in their abilities.\n\nFor people who are thinking about installing new hardwood floors Anders recommends considering how much they like to entertain even just around the holidays. They can select a material that will hold up to heavy traffic and require less maintenance preventing a lot of future repair issues. The result is a floor they can enjoy for years with their friends and family. The Hardwood Flooring Store features a variety of styles and materials to fit many homeowners needs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T17:57:29.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
