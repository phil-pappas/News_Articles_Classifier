The catering brand is named for culinary supervisor Adrian Pitts , who oversees the BBQ program and promotes the philosophy of having fun while cooking.\nAfter winning first place at 2014 Plant City Pig Jam for its pork shoulder and third place for ribs, the Pitts & Giggles team decided to take its talents on the road. Party planners seeking to impress guests with tasty meats can contact Crimson Tavern, which will bring its smoker and other accoutrements - rolls and plenty of paper supplies - to any venue. Three packages are available with prices ranging from $18 to $24 per person. A minimum $500 order is required.\nA complete catered barbecue meal includes any combination of cherry wood chicken, sweet heat pulled pork, anise brined turkey, pulled chicken, St. Louis ribs, 13-hour brisket, Texas smoked sausage and sliced pork loin. A variety of sides include pig head beans, Zellwood corn on the cob, Florida cheddar grits, and country ham crusted mac and cheese. Because no award-winning BBQ fare is complete without peach cobbler, country apple pie, banana bread pudding or Southern pecan pie, Pitts & Giggles serves up dessert too.\nPitts & Giggles uses its own line of rubs and sauces to tenderize and flavor its meats. Among the most popular sauces is its Carolina BBQ Sauce, which Pitts gladly shares the recipe for:\nIngredients:\n6 garlic cloves 2 rough chopped onions 2/3 cup apple cider vinegar 2/3 cup vegetable stock 1 cup Worcestershire sauce ¼ cup Ancho chili powder 2 tablespoons paprika ¾ cup Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons molasses 2 tablespoons chipotle chilies in adobo 2 tablespoons honey 2 cups ketchup ¼ cup dark brown sugar Salt as desired Fresh ground pepper as desired Procedure:\nSauté onion and garlic until translucent, then deglaze with stock. Add the rest of the ingredients. Cook for 15 minutes at a simmer. Puree mixture until smooth. Continue to cook for 15 minutes. Season to taste.
