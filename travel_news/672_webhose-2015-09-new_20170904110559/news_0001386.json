He was once seen as a future CEO of the British retailer but his star waned as Marks & Spencer struggled to deliver a sustained increase in clothing sales.\nIn SA, Woolworths has grown both market share and profit by focusing on high-end groceries and wealthier shoppers amid sluggish overall consumer demand as the country’s economic growth is declining.\nThat has helped drive its shares up 26% this year, outperforming a 2% gain in SA’s benchmark index.\nReuters", "external_links": ["http://bdlive.profiledata.co.za/ShareData/Company/CompanyChart.aspx?JSECode=WHL"], "published": "2015-09-30T22:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:56:25.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
