Research from the government’s savings arm, NS&I, suggests that those with a specific goal save faster and more successfully than those that don’t, putting away up to £550 more every year. But how can you reach that all-important target? Follow the five tips below to ensure you reach your goal. Set a savings target If you want to save for a specific item, it’s essential that you first consider your own budget. It’s no use you planning to put away £500 a month if you only have £200 of disposable income after essential bills, as you will only become discouraged if you never hit your target. Write down your goal, and divide it by the amount you believe that you can successfully save each month. That will give you the number of months, or even years, it will take to reach your goal. Choose the best account for your needs If you leave the money that you are saving in your current account, you are more likely to fritter it away. Instead, open a specific account for the cash that you are saving. Saving for the short term? If you’re saving for a short-term goal and will need to access the money in under five years, you are unlikely to want to use an investment account where the money can go up as well as down. A term deposit account (often known as a fixed rate bond) may give you a higher rate than an ordinary instant access account, with the added bonus that you can’t get at the money too easily if you fear you may spend it. A cash Isa, like this one offered by Alliance Trust , is also a tax-efficient place to watch your money grow. Some banks also offer Regular Saver accounts, which give you a higher rate in return for putting away a minimum amount each month. Saving for a medium-term goal? If you’re looking to access your money in between five to 10 years, investments may be a better bet since history shows that over most ten year periods these outperform cash. You can also use an Isa to invest in stocks, shares or funds. Saving for the future? For longer-term goals you will need to consider the impact of inflation on your investments. Shares, bonds or funds will help to minimise this impact, which can have a serious effect on your ability to meet your savings goal. Consider shares that pay an income to ensure that your money grows steadily, and if you have any concerns you can discuss these with an independent financial adviser for a charge. Use your bank to help you save If you are putting a set amount away each month, you should set up a standing order from your bank account so that the money goes directly into your chosen savings product. This will stop you getting to the end of the month and spending it on something else. Some UK current accounts have other facilities that can help you to save even more cash painlessly each month, so make sure you shop around for the best deals. For example, a number of UK banks offer a service called “Save the Change”, which allows you to round up every debit card transaction to the nearest pound and places the remainder in a savings account. Some accounts also have a “sweep facility”, which puts the money that is left over at the end of the month into a savings account automatically, to keep your cash working hard for you. These small changes will quickly add up. Review your goal and your financial position frequently There’s a high chance that your financial position will change while you’re saving, which means that the amount of money that you can put away may change too. For example, if you get a pay rise, you should ideally readjust your standing order the second that you receive your increase – this tactic means that you will probably not even notice the difference! It’s also important to check that the target that you’re saving for is still going to give you the result that you want. For example, if you are saving for a child’s school or university fees, these may rise at a rate higher than inflation, meaning that you will need to adjust your goal frequently. Otherwise, you may find that the savings pot you are aiming for will not give you the results that you need. If you’re putting away large amounts of money each month, you’ll want to make sure that it works as hard as possible. While you may be aware of tax-efficient structures, such as Isas and pensions, there may be experts who can help you to ensure that your money grows in the most appropriate fashion and that you do not pay too much tax on it. Major changes to the pension rules that came in on 6 April mean that pensions, for example, are a much more flexible savings structure and may be appropriate for some savings goals, depending on your age and where you are in life. If your goal involves passing on money to your children, the rules concerning inheritance tax are changing too. As well as Isas and pensions, there are other products such as trusts, which may be effective savings vehicles for those who are saving for specific goals such as school fees for children. An independent financial adviser will be able to help you work out the most efficient structure for your savings. If you are investing for the long term to reach your goal, an adviser can also help you to put together a diversified portfolio of shares, gilts and other investment products that matches your risk appetite. You may also be able to do this yourself using research available on the internet. If you feel unsure though, always ask an expert.
