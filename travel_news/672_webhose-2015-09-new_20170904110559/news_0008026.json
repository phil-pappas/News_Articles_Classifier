It has a head-turning design. Source: AAP \nThe 142m-long vessel features a helipad, three swimming pools, six guest rooms and even a secret “nookie room”. There’s also a disco below the deck, and many mirrored surfaces across its interior. \nDie Segeljacht \"White Pearl\" ist nach ihrer ersten Probefahrt wieder in ihrer Werft im Kieler Hafen eingelaufen. Sie gilt als größtes Segelschiff der Welt. Posted by NDR 1 Welle Nord on Monday, September 21, 2015 \nBuilt by the German Naval Yards shipyard, it was designed by Philippe Starck, who has described it as a “stealth yacht”. \n“Physically it is more a fish than a building, which deviates quite a bit from what is being done today,” Mr Starck told Yachts International . \n“Inside are extraordinary technical innovations that yield extraordinary comfort, which are very large spaces. \n“In many yachts you have small corridors, small rooms and complicated things. This project nearly has no corridors but rather large lofts, very pleasant gigantic rooms with many windows.” \nIt has a crew of 35 to cater to the every whim of the billionaire and his Serbian model wife Aleksandra Nikolic. \nThe pair also owns a Boeing jet and a series of Monet paintings. I always imagine the yacht of the next James Bond villain to look like the “White Pearl” http://t.co/cpXMdD9y0j — Alex Kurys (@stadtkind) September 21, 2015 Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko built a 482-foot sailing yacht. http://t.co/Wgr8hL2uqB What's your dream boat look like?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T04:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T04:33:14.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
