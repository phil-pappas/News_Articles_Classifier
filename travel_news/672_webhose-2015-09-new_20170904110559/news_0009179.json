It has to stop. Picture: Emily Bingham/Facebook Source: Facebook\nBingham begs for people stop probing “young married couples” and “parents of an only-child toddler” about their family plans, as well as “single 30-somethings” about their ticking biological clock.\nBecause beneath the surface, there may be any number of very serious, very personal issues you might aggravate, Bingham says.\n“You don’t know who is struggling with infertility or grieving a miscarriage or dealing with health issues. You don’t know who is having relationship problems or is under a lot of stress or the timing just isn’t right. You don’t know who is on the fence about having kids or having more kids. You don’t know who has decided it’s not for them right now, or not for them ever. You don’t know how your seemingly innocent question might cause someone grief, pain, stress or frustration,” she wrote.\nInstead, Bingham suggests asking other basic questions, because if somebody wants to open up about their procreative decisions, they will do so when they’re ready.\nNone of your business ... Bingham begs people to stop asking about others’ plans to reproduce. Picture: Emily Bingham/Facebook Source: Facebook\n“Ask someone what they’re excited about right now. Ask them what the best part of their day was. If a person wants to let you in on something as personal as their plans to have or not have children, they will tell you,” she wrote.\nBingham explained that she was driven to spread her message by her own experiences, as well as those of her friends.\nIn a comment, she explained that one friend who underwent a “stressful and heart-wrenching year of fertility treatments before conceiving her son” was already fielding questions about baby No. 2 when he was one-month-old.\nDrawing praise ... Commenters were supportive of Bingham’s stance. Picture: Emily Bingham/Facebook Source: Facebook\nThe post struck a chord with many. Seraphina Maria posted: “I love you so much. People asking me about my child bearing plans drives me up a tree. Be they my parents or PERFECT STRANGERS, because that happens all too often.”\nAnother, Cyndi Quote: : “Never understood why this needs to be explained...but glad that you’ve done it so beautifully.”\nOriginally published as The question you need to stop asking", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/09/29/1227549/816307-4b92afd2-66a7-11e5-a694-a01135d43b99.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/09/29/1227549/816253-4b2c3734-66a7-11e5-a694-a01135d43b99.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/09/29/1227549/815947-4bfa51aa-66a7-11e5-a694-a01135d43b99.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/parenting/reproductive-plans-are-none-of-your-business-says-michigan-writer-emily-bingham-in-facebook-plea/story-fnet08ck-1227549817474"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T21:07:31.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
