The new longer trains will increase capacity on the line during the morning peak by 50% from July 2016.\n \nNetwork Rail will build the longer platforms and infrastructure, and Southern Railway will lease, refurbish and run the trains.\n \nTom Tugendhat MBE, Member of Parliament for Tonbridge, Edenbridge and Malling, said: “I am pleased that the platform extensions on the Uckfield line are taking place and will be completed soon. This will mean that commuters and other rail users will be able to have a more comfortable journey as trains are able to take extra carriages. Work is now underway and this will be a huge benefit to the local community in providing a better train service. I look forward to the completion of the work early next year”.\n \nNetwork Rail project manager, Craig Melhuish, said: “By extending the platforms we will be able to run longer trains that will reduce congestion and improve the daily commute for thousands of people each day.\n \n“Our work has been planned closely with the train operator to keep any disruption to train services to an absolute minimum. I’d like to thank passengers and local residents in advance for their patience and understanding while we carry out this much needed upgrade to the railway.”\n \nNetwork Rail started setting up site compounds in early August 2015, with permanent works starting this month at some sites and in the New Year for others. The stations will be completed on a staggered basis between February and July 2016.\n \nThe main impact is summarised below:\n2 November – 27 November 2015 The line will be closed between Hurst Green and Uckfield, Monday to Friday between 0920 and 1640 – with changes to last trains Monday to Thursday. 4 January –20 February 2016 The line will be closed between Crowborough and Uckfield, all day. 29 February – 24 March 2016 The line will be closed between Hurst Green and Uckfield, Monday to Friday between 0920 and 1640 – with changes to last trains Monday to Thursday There will be weekend closures from Hurst Green to Uckfield at various points between August 2015 and May 2016  \nSource:- Network Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T18:36:59.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
