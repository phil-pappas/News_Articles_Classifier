In Madrid , this will include the imposing Bank of Spain building, built in the 19th century. Visitors will be able to tour its vast headquarters and see the lavish art collection.\nOther locations open to visitors include the headquarters of the Fundación Francisco Giner de los Ríos (Free Institute of Education), which has a shimmering exterior that blurs the lines between indoors and out, as well as a space-age lecture theatre.\nThe Gimnasio Maravillas, a notoriously-complicated school gym extension designed by architect Alejandro de la Sota , is also part of the programme, as are the iconic Madrid Tower and the beautiful concrete Hydrographic Studies Center, designed by Miguel Fisac.\nGimnasio Maravillas Open House was started in London in 1992 . A decade later the project launched in New York and is now held in 31 cities. In the past three years particularly, the festival has grown rapidly to cities such as Athens, Oslo, Prague and Adelaide.\nOther upcoming Open House events this autumn and winter will take place in Lisbon, Buenos Aires, Perth and New York.\nopenhouseworldwide.org", "external_links": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/23/1443018946520/a6ba1391-6ef9-4ab6-b51f-3146c67a8168-620x372.jpeg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=fce3de9634a7d2e2d0e738770f45369b", "http://www.alejandrodelasota.org/en/", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/23/1443018946520/a6ba1391-6ef9-4ab6-b51f-3146c67a8168-620x372.jpeg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=bc231846bbea3e55dec2a8231994839a", "http://www.openhouseworldwide.org/openhouse/madrid.php", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/23/1443018946520/a6ba1391-6ef9-4ab6-b51f-3146c67a8168-620x372.jpeg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=480330d0191ce86c9e8626a8489abdc1", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/23/1443018946520/a6ba1391-6ef9-4ab6-b51f-3146c67a8168-620x372.jpeg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=c9c8ab119e40b31101cf36022904a197", "http://www.fundacionginer.org/"], "published": "2015-09-24T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T16:24:08.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
