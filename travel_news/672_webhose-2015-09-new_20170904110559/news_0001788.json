The property he’d booked in Baltimore, the Mount Vernon Hotel, was being remodeled and reopening as the Hotel Indigo Baltimore — Mt. Vernon.\nExtreme might also describe what the hotel did to his reservation for this spring. The Indigo, which was under new ownership, canceled all reservations.\n“I received no notification about the change,” explains Reich, a government worker who lives in Ocean City, N.J. He found out about the renovations by coincidence, he said, and learned that his reservation had been canceled a few months before his scheduled arrival. He’d been trying to find out whether he had a place to stay, and he asked me for help.\nMost hotel renovation stories are less dramatic. They’re minor inconveniences, such as construction noise or a closed pool. Usually, the problems they cause can all be resolved the same way: with persistence, politeness and patience.\nI contacted InterContinental Hotels Group, which owns the Indigo brand, on Reich’s behalf. The company reviewed his case, offered to cover the cost of staying at an alternate property for two nights and offered an upgrade to a bigger room.\nThe incident raises questions for anyone planning a hotel stay. What happens if the property is under construction? What recourse do travelers have if it turns out there’s effectively no hotel to stay in?\n“There’s no particular standard or manual as to when to close a hotel during a renovation,” says Amanda Parsons, the former general manager of the Hotel Vintage Seattle, a veteran of three hotel remodeling projects. “A hotel needs to be realistic when looking at the scope of the renovation and the overall impact to the guest.”\nWhen peace and quiet are in short supply, the hotel can usually address the issue if it’s notified quickly.\nFor example, if the jackhammers outside your window are keeping you awake during your afternoon nap, the hotel might be able to move you to a different room or comp your breakfast for the inconvenience.\nWaiting until you get home to complain is less effective. Often, a hotel can do little more at that stage than apologize, a gesture that will probably ring hollow after a noise-filled vacation.\nIn extreme cases, when construction is so extensive that the room is uninhabitable, a hotel may even turn you away before check-in. When that happens, the standard industry practice is to “walk” you to another property. In that scenario, the hotel will cover at least one night in a comparable place nearby.\n“If you have to walk a guest to another hotel, it is typical for the renovating hotel to pay for the guest’s accommodations at the other hotel and make the arrangements for the guest,” says Beau Benton, president of Larry Blumberg & Associates, a hotel management company based in Dothan, Ala.\nYou can avoid the inconvenience, and the possibility of being walked, by taking a few simple steps. Experts recommend that you monitor social-media buzz about the property where you’ll be staying.\n“Customers are always happy to share,” says Bonnie Best, the general manager for the Hotel Valencia Santana Row, a luxury hotel in San Jose, Calif., which just finished a renovation.\nSam Cicero, the founder of Cicero’s Development, a general contractor in Plainfield, Ill., that specializes in hotels, says the direct approach works best: Call and ask.\n“A phone call works the best, prior to arrival,” he says. “Ask if there are any areas of the hotel due to be under renovation during the period of your stay.”\nBeyond that, if you find yourself in a property that you find is not suitable for your vacation, consider brushing up on your rights under your state’s innkeeper laws, which are searchable online.\nStrictly speaking, none of the laws give you a right to a noise-free room, but that doesn’t mean you have to suffer.\nThe best hotel managers try their hardest to make a renovation project known “as soon possible to the hotel guests,” Cicero notes.\nIf you do want to say something, don’t wait. Mind your manners and invoke the hotel’s reputation for customer service to persuade them to take care of you.\nBecause if you remain quiet, your only option will be a set of reliable earplugs. That’s no way to travel.\nChristopher Elliott, National Geographic Traveler’s reader advocate and author of “How to Be the World’s Smartest Traveler,” maintains a consumer advocate website at elliott.org.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T06:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T17:57:22.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
