The stellar line-up includes slopestyle superstars Katie Summerhayes, Jamie Nicholls and Billy Morgan. The athletes are participating in Q&As and doing meet and greet sessions for fans at the shows, and some of them will be competing in the Brits, a pro freestyle competition held at the London event on a specially constructed 50-ft kicker in Battersea Park. But who's who on the GB Park and Pipe team? We take a whistlestop tour of the top freestyle talent coming to the shows: Jamie Nicholls Date of birth: 21/07/1993 From: Bradford Discipline: Snowboard slopestyle Nicholls is the cream of the GB park and pipe team crop. He recently pulled off a second epic trick-filled stunt at Hemel Hempstead's Snow Centre, and this latest attempt has already garnered over 25,000 views on YouTube. He was on the Olympic squad at Sochi 2014, and placed 6th in the snowboard slopestyle finals. Not bad for a boy from Bradford. Katie Summerhayes Date of birth: 08/10/1995 From: Sheffield Discipline: Ski slopestyle Summerhayes is one of the UK's brightest freestyle stars Photo: 2015 Getty Images Summerhayes doesn't shy away from firsts. In 2013 she became the first British female skier in 19 years to win a medal in a World Cup event when she finished second in the slopestyle competition in Silvaplana, Switzerland. Then, in 2015, she became the first ever British female to win a World Championship medal in freestyle skiing when she took silver in the slopestyle event in Kreischberg, Austria. Other highlights of this up-and-comer's career include winning gold at the 2014 Junior World Championships in Valmalenco, Italy, and placing 7th in ski slopestyle at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Billy Morgan Date of birth: 02/04/1989 From: Southampton Discipline: Snowboard slopestyle Morgan didn't even take up snowboarding until the age of 14, when he tried it for the first time on a dry ski slope. However, his previous hobby of acrobatic gymnastics meant he was already au fait with somersaulting through the air – a background which would stand him in good stead for his career as a pro snowboarder. He finished the 2012/13 season ranked second in snowboard slopestyle in the FIS World Ranking List, and placed 10th in the men's slopestyle final at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. In April this year Morgan made history, becoming the first person ever to land a quadruple cork (four off-axis flips and five full rotations). Kudos. Aimee Fuller Date of birth: 21/07/1991 From: Farnborough Discipline: Snowboard slopestyle Aimee Fuller at the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014 Photo: 2014 Getty Images Among Fuller's best results are victory at the 2012 Pleasure Jam and becoming the first woman to land a double backflip in competition at X Games Europe in 2013. She was part of Team GB for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, competing in snowboard slopestyle – but Fuller is perhaps best remembered from the Games for her stint in the BBC commentary box. She joined Tim Warwood and Ed Leigh to watch Jenny Jones win her historic bronze medal in snowboard slopestyle, and was overcome with excitement when her teammate won, saying, \"I think I might cry!\" Katie Ormerod Date of birth: 25/08/1997 From: Bradford Discipline: Snowboard slopestyle and big air Ormerod may be a young'un, but she's a good'un. She made snowboard history last year by being the first woman to pull off a double cork 1080 (two full flips and one full spin) – she was just 16 at the time. Why was it such a big deal? Because up until that point, people weren't even sure it was physically possible for a woman to do this trick. And there's more… In 2012 Ormerod won both slopestyle and big air at the Brits, following it up with victory in the halfpipe the following year. She also finished 2nd at the 2013 Burton European Junior Open slopestyle, and became only the 5th woman ever to land a double backflip. Fun fact: Jamie Nicholls is her cousin. Meet all these athletes and more at this year’s Telegraph Ski & Snowboard Shows in Manchester (October 30 to November 1) and London (November 5 to 8).
