Photo courtesy of Airbus The double-decker A380 jumbo jet was French aircraft manufacturer Airbus’s answer to the Boeing 747. Plans for the 600+-seat jumbo jet began in 1991, when Airbus started discussing its plans with the world’s airlines.\nThe Toulouse, France-based manufacturer wanted an entirely new large aircraft that could handle high-density, long-haul routes like Hong Kong-London where passenger traffic was growing and capacity was under pressure.\nAirbus moved ahead with what they called the A3XX, consultation with airlines, airports, aviation safety authorities and pilots.\nOn May, 1 1996, Airbus announced it had set up a “large aircraft division” to develop the A3XX, created to refine market studies already undertaken, define the aircraft specifications process input from the airlines.\nBy 1998, Airbus was in consultation with some 20 leading airlines about what they wanted to see in the proposed double-decker A3XX. The program was officially launched in December 2000, when it was renamed the A380, and four years later, the final assembly line in Toulouse was officially opened by France’s prime minister. The aircraft would be capable of carrying 525 people in two classes non-stop from Europe to Asia, North America and South America.\nThe first A380 was unveiled on January, 18, 2005, with 14 launch customers and 149 orders. The jumbo jet’s first flight took place in Toulouse on April, 27, 2005, and lasted for three hours and 54 minutes.\nAfter some production delays, the first A380 was delivered on October 15, 2007, to Singapore Airlines . The carrier’s A380 featured 471 seats in three classes – including the innovative individual suites for first class passengers -- on its Singapore-Sydney route.\nFollowing three more deliveries to Singapore Airlines, Airbus delivered the first A380 to Dubai-based Emirates on July, 28, 2008. Australian flag carrier Qantas was next to receive the A380, on September 19, 2008.\nThe 50th A380 was delivered on June 16, 2011, to Singapore Airlines, joining operators Air France , Emirates, Korean Air , Lufthansa and Qantas Airways .\nThe A380 is the world’s largest commercial aircraft flying today, with a capacity of 544 passengers in a four-class configuration, and up to 853 in a single-class configuration. It features a main deck and an upper deck, linked by fixed stairs forward and aft.\nThe A380's cabin flexibility allows airlines to differentiate their products and develop layouts tailored to their market requirements. Singapore Airlines’ first class Suites feature an individual cabin with sliding doors and window blinds, an armchair hand-stitched by master Italian craftsmen, a standalone bed, a 23-inch wide LCD screen and extensive audio and video-on-demand.\nEmirates’ A380 suites feature privacy doors, a personal mini-bar, a private inflight cinema, a seat that converts into a fully flat bed with mattress, a vanity table and mirror and access to an onboard shower.\nAnd then there is The Residence, an apartment with a living room, bedroom and private bathroom, featured on Abu Dhabi-based Etihad’s A380. The living room has a leather double-seat sofa with ottoman, two dining tables, a chilled drinks cabinet and 32-inch flat screen TV. It also comes with a butler and a private chef.\nAll passengers’ comfort is further enhanced by technologies equipped on A380, including advanced lighting systems, new standards of inflight entertainment, cabin air that is recycled every two minutes and natural light provided by 220 cabin windows. As of August 2015, Airbus reported that the A380 had 317 orders and 169 deliveries.\nHistory courtesy of Airbus .\nEDITOR'S NOTE: Please follow my travel-related magazines on Flipboard: Best of About Travel , a joint curation venture with my fellow About Travel Experts; and Travel-Go!
