Crowne Plaza® Hotels & Resorts, the business travel brand for InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG), worked with YouGov to commission the research as part of a campaign that promotes the importance of first impressions in business. It found that two-thirds of respondents rated sense of humour as central to successful business relationships, ahead of other factors such as appearance, intelligence, confidence and a good handshake. Despite the convenience of technology, 75 per cent of respondents said that they prefer face-to-face meetings when possible Jez is fronting the First Impressions campaign, which includes a short film for the Crowne Plaza website, giving hints and tips for making a positive impression on business associates. “What [the research] tells us is that it’s not about trying to be funny or cracking jokes during your meeting,” he continued. “It’s about conveying a good sense of humour to create a connection. This can be done simply by having a cheery disposition and smiling. Sometimes these small things are overlooked in business meetings and yet they make all the difference.” In another finding, the survey reflected the importance of social media in business, with a third of respondents saying that it is “very important” to have the right profile picture on networking sites. It also revealed the increased use of virtual forms of communication in a business context. 76 per cent of those surveyed said they use email as the first means of making contact with a new client or colleague. Almost a half (45 per cent) said they send text messages to business associates. This is in contrast to 10 years ago, when only one in five business people used this method, according to Jez. Despite the convenience of technology, an overwhelming majority of respondents (75 per cent) said that they prefer face-to-face meetings when possible. And when it comes to making the right impression in such a setting, they stated that the worst habits are talking over people and not making eye contact. To help its guests form the right habits, IHG’s vice president for the Crowne Plaza® Hotel & Resorts brand in Europe, Tom Rowntree, said: “We’ve partnered with Jez Rose to share some insights and simple behavioural tools for creating a positive first impression and facilitating business interactions.” In light of this new research and the importance placed on humour, it seems the company was wise in choosing Jez as its partner. Prior to launching his career as a business trainer and behavioural expert, he was a stand-up comic.
