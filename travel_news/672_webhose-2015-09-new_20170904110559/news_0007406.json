Considered to be Czech’s rail hub, inter-railers and domestic tourists flock to the city via its railways to enjoy the restaurants, bars, clubs, and beautiful streets. It is also within driving distance for many Europeans, and has a nearby airport with convenient bus connections to the city. Why, then, do so many travellers opt for a Prague airport shuttle to get them from the airport to the city? \nSpeed \nFor all but the most local travellers, a flight to the airport and a shuttle to the city represent the quickest way to start one’s holiday. Whereas trains and cars are both viable methods of transport, the journey can take many hours, or even days (and, via train, multiple interchanges). On the other hand, the city can be reached from almost anywhere in the world with a flight and private transport from the airport. A Prague airport shuttle can also be arranged at unsociable hours of the day or night, whereas public transport becomes very difficult late at night. \nComfort \nIf you organise a convenient Prague airport shuttle to meet you, you will be guaranteed a seat and a direct journey with relatively few stops. You can put your bags in the boot without worrying about security, and you won’t have to carry anything on your lap. With only a few days' holiday, many people feel that it’s worth paying a little extra to ensure that travel arrangements go as smoothly as possible. \nAs well as the physical comfort is the peace of mind that comes from knowing that, when you land, you’ll have a driver who knows the way to the city centre. This eliminates a huge amount of the stress surrounding missed buses and trying to find the different parts of the airport. It also means you don’t have to worry about delays; the best companies will check your flight’s status online and wait for you if you’re delayed. \nPrice \nWhile public transport is the cheapest option, a shuttle still represents a significant saving over a taxi. For this reason, it is the choice of many of those travelling to the city, as a shuttle guarantees you a seat, some degree of personal space, and can be booked at extremely competitive prices. \nEfficiency \nA Prague airport shuttle has no changes and fewer stops than a bus, meaning less fuss between you and your destination. Depending on the number of other passengers, and therefore the number of stops, the shuttle could take as little as 30 minutes direct to city centre. Meanwhile, buses tend to require subsequent changes to further buses or to the metro in order to reach the city centre, which is far from ideal when you’re carrying luggage. Similarly, should public transport be delayed, a shuttle is free to take alternative routes (in case of traffic) or dodge the delays entirely (in case of metro malfunctions). \nFor these reasons and many more, a Prague airport shuttle is a popular transportation option for those in search of a smooth, efficient journey.   from ArticlesFactory.com ABOUT THE AUTHOR \nLukas Johannes is a driver for Shuttle Direct.
