Liben is returning to Tzell Travel Group – a Travel Leaders Group company – as its President and CEO, while maintaining his position on the Board of Directors for the latter. As Chief Executive Officer of Travel Leaders Group and as its new Board member, Chacko is returning to the travel industry after six years as CEO of PR Newswire, the global leader of communications and global marketing solutions.\n“After very thoughtful consideration – particularly during the last few months when I’ve been reminded on a daily basis just how much I’ve loved returning to my roots at Tzell, where I first began in 1977 – I’ve decided to step away from my role as CEO for all of Travel Leaders Group and instead devote my energies and attention exclusively to Tzell as its CEO,” stated Liben in a message to Travel Leaders Group employees. “I am thrilled to pass the torch of this exceptionally strong enterprise to a new Chief Executive Officer: Ninan Chacko. Ninan will add a fresh, new dimension to Travel Leaders Group that will enable us to reach greater heights. While he’s provided respected, visionary and innovative leadership to PR Newswire since 2009, what makes Ninan a particularly strong fit for Travel Leaders Group are his two decades of experience in various leadership positions within the travel and transportation industry.”\n“Since its creation in 2008, Travel Leaders Group has become a recognized and powerful force within the travel industry as the largest traditional travel agency group, garnering significant respect while building a strong reputation,” noted Chacko. “After watching the spectacular rise of Travel Leaders Group, it is a distinct honor to take the reins from Barry Liben, whose leadership we salute today. I look forward to working with Travel Leaders Group’s extraordinary leadership team in writing the next chapter for this organization.”\nBefore joining PR Newswire in 2009, Chacko served as Chief Commercial Officer of Worldspan. In that role, he was responsible for sales, marketing, operations, service and support activities for customers and partners in over 60 countries, including Tzell, Travel Leaders Corporate and Travel Leaders Franchise Group. Chacko was also a founding member of the buyout consortium management team that acquired Worldspan from Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines and American Airlines, and served as Chief Commercial Officer until its sale to Travelport.\nPrior to Worldspan, Chacko spent more than 13 years with Sabre Holdings. As Senior Vice President, he led the development, launch and operation of Sabre’s hotel merchant business in the travel agency channel and the creation and execution of Sabre’s consortia network strategy to influence and monetize travel retailing. During his time with Sabre, he served in a variety of leadership roles, including Senior Vice President of Marketing and Strategy for Sabre Travel Network and Senior Vice President of Global Services. Chacko began his career with System One Corporation before joining American Airlines.\nSource:-Travel Leaders Group", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T06:06:18.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
