They were there to get the first look at the brand’s “Art for Love” photo exhibition, celebrating 32 of the finest photographers in the business, with the proceeds supporting amfAR’s Countdown to a Cure for AIDS initiative. The works were then sold in a silent auction last night.\n“All the best photographers in the world are here,” said the project’s curator, Fabien Baron , referring to the walls lined with images by the likes of Patrick Demarchelier , Annie Leibovitz , and Bruce Weber . “That’s the real tour de force—everybody said yes to this charity project.”\nBefore dinner, guests including Michael Avedon , Jamie Bochert , and Terry Richardson previewed the exhibition, which features Moncler’s classic Maya puffer jacket. “I have been working on a ballet-dancer series, so I just asked Faye Arthurs of the New York City Ballet to toss on the jacket at the last minute,” explained legendary lensman Arthur Elgort , who was on hand with his daughter Sophie Elgort .\nModels Britt Maren and Martha Hunt were enjoying a night off. “We aren’t in it, but we wish we were. The photos are stunning,” said Maren, as she admired Lachlan Bailey ’s shot of Edita Vilkeviciute . “I’m not doing shows this season, so I’m able to go to events like this during Fashion Week, and hopefully the U.S. Open,” she admitted.\nHunt was also heading to the Open: “I’m taking my parents! I’m so proud of myself for pulling that all together in the middle of Fashion Week.” Both ladies, in case there was any question, were rooting for Serena Williams .\nAfter an elegant, candlelit dinner, the crowd started to disperse around 11 p.m. It was, after all, only Night One of the fashion month marathon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T23:30:51.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
