With the exuberance of a skater popping an ollie off a ramp, the Kennedy Center launches its season this weekend with a 10-day outdoor festival that will transform the arts center’s front plaza into a temporary skate park.\nA specially built bowl will become the heart-center of “ Finding a Line: Skateboarding, Music and Media ,” bringing live music and skaters together to create a new kind of performance art. Nationally known skaters and local clubs and bands will team up during open skate sessions and performances starting Friday and running daily through Sept. 13.\n“What I am most concerned with is how the musicians and skaters interact as an ensemble,” said festival curator Jason Moran, Kennedy Center’s artistic director for jazz.\n“Skate culture exists in the shadows, and jazz also exists in the shadows of music,” said Moran, who will perform two concerts with his band and participate in a panel discussion on the role of video in skate culture. “We’re inviting a lot of people from the community to come and set up shop and play and share, and that’s tremendous.”\n[ Jazz has a “righteous” feel when combined with kickflips and ollies ]\nThe Kennedy Center tapped Ben Ashworth, a well-known force in the local skating community, to build the bowl and to corral support from skaters. Ashworth is a natural choice, since he was involved with two other community-driven skateboarding projects: the Green Skate Lab in Northeast and Bridge Spot in Capitol Hill.\nThis specially built bowl—measuring 4 feet high, 20 feet wide and 40 feet long—will be assembled in the front plaza of the Kennedy Center. The wooden structure will serve as the centerpiece of “Finding a Line: Skateboarding, Music and Media,” a 10-day outdoor festival beginning Sept. 4. (Ben Ashworth) Free and ticketed events feature local skate teams hosting open skates most afternoons, with Moran and his band closing the festival with concerts Sept. 11-12 at 8 p.m. Skaters, including Ron Allen, Sean Sheffey, Steve Caballero, Ben Hatchell and Elissa Steamer, will take part in the jam sessions.\n[ The Kennedy Center has a temporary skate park, and anyone can use it ]\nAshworth, a skater and sculpture studio manager at George Mason University, was drawn to the idea of designing and building a space that would nurture creativity and spur improvisation among the skaters, musicians and audience. “You become more than yourself when you’re improvising,” said Ashworth, who was assisted by Bryan Landgrover, Devin McGuire and Dave Mutarelli. “There’s a lot of room for synergy and serendipity.”\nThe Kennedy Center itself was another big draw. “It’s a space you get kicked out of, so it’s amazing that we’re getting invited,” he said. “All that marble — it’s a dream.”\nAshworth sought out local skaters, surfers, musicians and his students for ideas. His goal was to create a space that would be welcoming to many types of skaters. “We move through space differently, and we have our own histories of how we ride,” he said.\nBen Ashworth tests out the newly completed bowl, which will serve as the centerpiece for the 10-day festival. (Amanda Voisard/For the Washington Post) The bowl — which is four feet high, 20 feet wide and 40 feet long — is an oval that kinks on one of its sides, creating a shape that resembles a kidney. The wooden structure was brought to the Kennedy Center in 30 pieces last weekend, forming the centerpiece of a temporary skate park that will feature other elements for skaters to ride. After the festival, the skate bowl is expected to find a permanent home in the District.\nAshworth and Jimmy Pelletier — a D.C. skater given the lofty title of chief skate ambassador — reached out to friends at local shops and skate clubs, signing up Cuba Skate, Palace 5ive, Art Under Pressure and others to participate.\nSome of the skateboards exhibited in “Art on Deck” at the Kennedy Center. (Supa JoE/Kennedy Center) Each team will bring a video crew to document its sessions, and the footage will be shared on social media and online. In addition, the center’s Hall of Nations will host two exhibitions: “Art on Deck” spotlights the hand-painted, custom-designed skate decks commissioned by Cuba Skate, and “The Nation Skate” features photographs of skateboarders from around the world.\n“Man, I thought it was an amazing idea,” said Brian Aguilar, manager of Art Under Pressure. The D.C. skateboard and graffiti shop that will host the open skate on Tuesday from 4 to 9 p.m. Its skate team will give demonstrations, and there will be painting and live music, Aguilar said. “The skateboarding scene in the D.C. area is really tight-knit,” he said. “Having the event and the Kennedy Center support is insane. It’s once in a lifetime.”\nFinding a Line: Skateboarding, Music and Media Friday through Sept. 13 on the front plaza of the Kennedy Center, 2700 F St. NW.\nJason Moran and the Bandwagon perform Sept. 11 and 12 at 8 p.m. Tickets are $22.\nThe rest of the festival is free.\nDaily open skate sessions and music lineups available at www.kennedy-center.org .", "external_links": ["https://jwpsrv.com/library/l33YMDXrEeKu+iIACp8kUw.js", "https://twitter.com/PeggyMcGlone", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/PeggyMcGlone", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/posttv-thumbnails-prod/thumbnails/55e5f219e4b047c43ed7f02c/20150901_skate_lapse.jpg", "http://www.kennedy-center.org/festivals/finding-a-line/welcome"], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T23:47:33.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
