Flying a drone anywhere Pope Francis will visit is against the law. Any unmanned aircraft (UAS) – including radio-controlled model aircraft/UAS – are subject to FAA requirements.\nThe airspace around Washington, DC is more restricted than in any other part of the country. A prohibition against flying any type of unmanned aircraft without specific approval exists around the District of Columbia, cities, towns, and airports. The FAA temporarily has expanded restrictions for all aircraft, including drones, to include Potomac Airfield, College Park, and Washington Executive/Hyde Park airports.\nThe FAA recently issued updated guidance for model aircraft operators that reflects the current law governing hobby or recreational drone use.\nNote to news media: Please download the FAA’s new digital message,No Drone Zone graphics, and audio and video sound bites from FAA Administrator Michael Huerta:\nAudio: The FAA wants you to leave your drone at home during the Papal visit.\nAudio: Washington, D.C., New York and Philadelphia are No Drone Zones during the Papal visit.\nAudio: The FAA has flight restrictions in place in and around Washington, D.C., New York and Philadelphia during the Papal visit.\nAudio: Flying a drone anywhere near the areas Pope Francis visits is against the law and violators could face stiff fines and criminal penalties.\nVideo: The FAA has flight restrictions in place during the Papal visit so please leave your drone at home.
