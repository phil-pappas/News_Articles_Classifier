One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In trading on Friday, shares of TravelCenters of America LLC ( TA ) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.5, after changing hands as low as $11.37 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 37.8. A bullish investor could look at TA's 29.5 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.
