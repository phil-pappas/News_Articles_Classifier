Total arrivals for 2014 stood at 116,414, according to TAT. \n\nFrancesc Escanez, managing director of Atlantida Viatges, added that Thailand’s success is being shared by other regional destinations such as Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam. \n\n“Travel is slowly recuperating in Spain, and it is South-east Asia that is performing best for longhaul (travel),” said Escanez. “We thought Thailand would suffer after what has been happening there in recent months, but we haven’t had cancellations.\" \n\nIndia and China are also showing growth this year, but Thailand and Indochina are benefitting most because of the value they offer, explained Escanez. \n\nHe added: “There has been little increase in prices in these (South-east Asian) countries and with their standards of service they are seen as (offering) better value than elsewhere like Brazil.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T02:48:21.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
