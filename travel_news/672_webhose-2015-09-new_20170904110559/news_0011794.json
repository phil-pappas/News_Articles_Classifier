The agreement will continue Finnair’s work to use IT to further its business strategy, transforming the airline’s current technology infrastructure into a flexible, hybrid cloud platform.\nAirlines are increasingly challenged to better manage costs, grow revenue and compete for customer loyalty. Digitalization, delivering a unique customer experience and achieving world-class operations are at the core of Finnair’s growth strategy, and world class IT infrastructure and services are essential enablers of it. As part of the agreement announced today, IBM will establish the new Finnair Cloud Platform to provide a foundation for the airline to support its growth initiatives. With the cloud platform, Finnair will reduce IT complexity, gain more flexibility to support dynamic business changes and significantly lower costs by consolidating applications.\n“For a network airline, operational excellence is a key success factor, and efficient IT services are a key enabler in this. IBM understands us, and has the airline industry expertise to help us achieve our goals,” said Kari Saarikoski, Chief Information Officer at Finnair. “This services agreement and powerful new cloud infrastructure are at the heart of our plans to improve our operational efficiency and provide the foundation for new digital services to deliver a better experience to our customers.”\nIBM will serve as Finnair’s IT services integrator by providing governance and support that will allow multiple technology solution vendors serving the airline to operate in a more transparent and efficient manner. In this role, IBM will oversee vendor performance, drive service quality improvements and help ensure airline industry best practices are adhered to.\nThe Finnair Cloud Platform will integrate several operational and commercial services, maximizing the hybrid cloud environment to support Finnair’s business goals. The company will also have access to IBM Watson Explorer capabilities to improve employee productivity by enabling agents to more quickly find responses to customer needs and intelligent, online self-help tools for employees to locate information.\nSource:-Finnair", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T06:17:10.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
