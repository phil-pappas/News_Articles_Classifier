There’s also a beginner “tot track” for local Marvins from Mars. \n“This is my first time to a bike park,” Kelton said. “This is great. There have been tons and tons of kids out here all day long. It’s great the way the progression is set up. You start out with real small jumps, and then they get a little bigger if you move to the next part.” \nKanish was making his fourth visit, and he doesn’t even own a BMX bike. He was riding a borrowed bicycle. Easy Arizona routes for mountain-biking newbies \n“It’s different from mountain biking because you don’t have to spend a lot of energy to get somewhere before you can even start riding,” Kanish said. “You can come out here for the day, and it’s a ton of fun.” \nBike-skill parks like the one at Fort Tuthill are popping up all over Arizona and the country. Chandler opened a 25,000-square-foot, all-concrete BMX/freestyle facility at Espee Park in 2007. In April, Goodyear opened a dirt pump track at Foothills Community Park. Pump tracks have a series of bumps, jumps, berms and turns designed to allow riders to use gravity rather than a lot of pedaling to get around the course. Tucson, Prescott, Show Low and McDowell Mountain Regional Park also have pump tracks or BMX parks. \nSkills parks, like the one at Fort Tuthill, include much more than pump tracks. The Fort Tuthill park currently has a tot track and three increasingly difficult flow trails with dirt jumps, but in time it will include pump tracks, flow tracks, another tot track for small children, big dirt jumps, dual slalom tracks, a perimeter cross-country trail and a cyclocross training circuit. \nAt the Sedona Posse Grounds Park, 95 percent of the design work has been completed on a skills park that will have flow tracks, pump tracks, a tot track, a skills zone and a jump park. \nPhil Kanish, of Flagstaff, catches some air at Fort Tuthill Bike Park. Mountain bike skills parks like the one at Fort Tuthill are growing in popularity, especially with families. (Photo: Bob Young/The Republic) \nAnd late last year, Mesa opened Desert Trails Bike Park, the crown jewel of Arizona bike parks, at McDowell and Recker roads. The 35-acre park is built around a large, natural hill that creates a drop-in area to build speed for flow trails. It also features a 3/4-mile loop trail that can be used for conventional mountain biking, running or hiking. \nDesert Trails has three flow trails rated much like ski slopes. The green Runaway Train trail is for beginners. The blue Squirrel Catcher trail is for intermediate-level riders and the black Double Trouble is for expert riders. \nIn a nice touch, there are bailout routes so riders who have second thoughts can ride around a jump or bump. Other features include a kids skills track, a pump track with wood jumps and bumps, as well as restrooms and two ramadas with picnic tables. \nMesa Parks and Recreation Director Marc Heirshberg moved to the Valley about six years ago from Colorado, where he had seen the success of bike parks. When he came upon the piece of land at McDowell and Recker, he was inspired. \n“It’s a beautiful, city-owned piece of property, but you really couldn’t get to much of it,” he said. “I drove by it one day and I said, ‘Man, one day that would make a great bike park.’ ” \nHeirshberg said Gravity Riders of Arizona, a local group of BMX, downhill and flow riders, helped prepare the property and develop the tracks. The city reached out to neighbors to make sure they were involved in the process. The park design includes a buffer zone to shield nearby homes. \n“That site had become a dumping ground over the years,” he said. “The Gravity Riders of Arizona were instrumental in cleaning it up, and they’re still out there doing trail maintenance.” \nNorris Design was the lead architect on the project, and Alpine Bike Tracks, based in Whistler, British Columbia, designed the progressive trail system and jumps. Funding was provided from the Parks Bond Program, approved by Mesa voters in 2012. The entire project cost the city less than $1 million. \nDaniel Scott, lead trails specialist for Alpine Bike Tracks, said the company has about 40 projects similar to Desert Trails around the country, either completed or in the works. \n“The feedback has been really positive,” he said. “These parks help to build a community, galvanizing existing users but also fostering growth in the sport by bringing people into it in a controlled environment. So you have kids out there learning skills at a nice, easy progression. It gives them a healthy, positive outlet to explore the sport. And it allows kids more independence to learn the freestyle part of the sport in a safe environment.” \nDoug Copp, bicycle coordinator for Sedona, said bike parks are a great way to introduce mountain biking to riders of all ages, and the facilities appeal to families because there’s something for all ages and skill levels. \nDesert Trails Bike Park at McDowell Road and Recker Road in Mesa includes a kid’s pump track with dirt and wood features.

Riders can warm up at the bike park before heading out to the forest trails.” \nHe said tourists often describe Sedona mountain-bike trails as difficult, and the bike park will provide a place for riders to progress through levels of difficulty first. \nIn Mesa, Heirshberg said the bike park has been even more popular than the city expected. He said he recently met members of a family from Pinetop-Lakeside who told him they drive to Mesa to use the bike park. \n“When we set out to do it, we asked, ‘What can we do that is multigenerational, that will encourage little kids, teens, adults and older adults to be active?’ ” he said. “This gives a lot of people the opportunity, whether they ride the trails, learn on the skills or pump track or just hike out there. \n“As the weather cools off, you’ll start to see a lot of kids out there right after school. Some of them will be doing their homework at the ramadas, too. It’s been extremely popular. I’ve been getting calls from colleagues (in the parks and recreation industry) about design and maintenance. \n“We’re all looking for anything we can do to help families to recreate together in a healthy, safe way and to appeal to as many generations as possible. It’s something we’re trying to do in Mesa with all of our projects, and this one has been great. I would hope these types of amenities will continue to pop up around the Valley.” \nBike-park features \nPump tracks: Usually short, rolling paths with banked turns that allow riders to keep moving without pedaling. \nFlow tracks: Like pump tracks, these take advantage of gravity to create momentum on a roller-coaster-like ride but with a little more pedaling. They are typically longer than pump tracks. \nDual salom trails: These courses are designed with two single-track trails, usually fairly technical in nature, aligned side-by-side so bicyclists can race one on one. \nDirt jumps: Sharply rising dirt berms coupled with a steep “drop in” that allow riders to catch serious air. \nCyclocross park: A course for bikes that are a hybrid of mountain and road bike. Cyclocross requires riding over various terrains and surfaces, including grass, dirt, sand and mud, with obstacles that require the rider to dismount the bike and carry it. \nChandler BMX Bike Event \nBMX magazine rated Chandler’s bike park as one of the best concrete tracks in the country, and the 25,000-square-foot park’s spines, bowls and rollers will host a BMX event for riders age 12-18. The Chandler BMX Bike Event includes skills clinics, bike demos from local vendors, entertainment and raffles. \nDetails: 9 a.m.-1 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 12. Espee Park, 450 E. Knox Road, Chandler. $3 for Chandler residents, $5 for others. 480-782-2746, chandleraz.gov/registration . 7 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1ED8OTM More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T04:21:46.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
