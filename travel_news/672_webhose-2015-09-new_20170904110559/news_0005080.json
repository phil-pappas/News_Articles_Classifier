The innovative and entertaining class, suitable for all levels of industry professional, will demonstrate how the tenets of improvisation link to business success.\nThe focus for meeting industry attendees will be to acquire new skills and to enhance their creativity, communication skills and influence. It will leverage improv techniques to strengthen team building, conflict management, networking and advanced problem solving skills. The program is also CMP certified.\n“It is important in our industry that we seek outside perspectives to sharpen our business acumen,” says Deborah Sexton, PCMA President and CEO. “PCMA Business School sessions always provoke and encourage participants to view challenges through the MBA lens.”\n“We’re delighted that PCMA are once again bringing their prestigious Business School program to IMEX America. The ability to offer this level of education to the industry is crucial – allowing us, as a profession, to develop core business skills which are crucial in any workplace. The PCMA Business School was a popular addition to Smart Monday last year and we expect Professor Kulhan to draw a large crowd once again. We are also excited that PCMA will be bringing Business School to Europe for the first time at IMEX in Frankfurt next April.” said Carina Bauer, CEO of the IMEX Group.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:20:18.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
