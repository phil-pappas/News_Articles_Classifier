She also explained about Alitalia’s clear strategy and direction to introduce real and lasting change. Ms Tiedt said that the key differentiator for Alitalia is the passion of the airline’s workforce.\n \nAubrey Tiedt said: “The transformation taking place at Alitalia is unprecedented with a complete restructuring of the business which is aimed at making us one of the world’s leading airlines. At the heart of this change are our employees.\n“The goals of the new Alitalia are achievable because we are giving our people, especially cabin crew and ground service agents, the tools they need to shine and the response so from our guests is extremely positive.”\n \nMs Tiedt told delegates in Las Vegas that cabin crew in the new Alitalia are the “style and image “of the airline’s brand and that everyone will be trained to think of themselves as a marketing expert and talented innovator, to be business oriented and hospitality focused.\n \nAlitalia has introduced specialised hospitality-focused training programs as part of its drive to empower cabin crew and the airline continues to work closely with its strategic partner Etihad Airways.\n \nThis training includes customer excellence workshops, leadership workshops, and business awareness workshops. By end of year 3,600 cabin crew will have completed customer excellence training and 160 senior cabin managers have already completed their leadership training.\n \nThe Alitalia brand continues to evolve and the airline launched a new livery earlier this year as well as elegant new inflight product, which includes Poltrona Frau leather seats in Business and First Class. Alitalia will also launch a new range of cabin crew uniforms.\n \nThe new interiors, décor, and furnishings incorporate modern Italian design and embody innovation and sophisticated service.There is also a new ‘Dine, Relax, Retire’ concept that gives premium guests greater choice and control about how they spend their time during the flight.\n \nPremium economy on Alitalia flights has also been significantly upgraded with an enhanced menu and service delivery that includes the introduction of limoncello as a ‘signature moment’ as well as espresso coffee and herbal teas.\n \nThere are also new meal choices and contemporary tray presentation, fine wines and warm bakery items in the Economy cabin as well as a caffè service on long haul flights, including freshly brewed Lavazza coffee.\n \nSource:-litalia", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T18:26:14.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
