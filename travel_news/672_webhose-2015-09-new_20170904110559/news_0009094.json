Sunrises and sunsets are so spectacular that they're cause for celebration all by themselves. As tropical getaways go, Hawaii couldn't be easier or more worth the trip, although visiting these Polynesian islands isn't always cheap. Whether you're dreaming of swimming in waterfall pools or lazing on golden-sand beaches, you'll find what you're looking for here. \nJust as in days of old, life in Hawaii is lived outdoors. Whether it's surfing, swimming, fishing or picnicking with the ʻohana (extended family and friends), encounters with nature are infused with the traditional Hawaiian value of aloha ʻaina – love and respect for the land. Go hiking across ancient lava flows and fluted pali (sea cliffs). Learn to surf, the ancient Hawaiian sport of \"wave sliding\", and then snorkel or dive with giant manta rays and sea turtles. Kayak to a deserted offshore island or hop aboard a winter whale-watching cruise. Back on land, ride horseback with paniolo (Hawaiian cowboys). \nFloating all by itself in the middle of the Pacific, Hawaii proudly maintains its own identity apart from the US mainland. Spam, shave ice, surfing, ukulele and slack key guitar music, hula, pidgin, \"rubbah slippah\" (jandals) – these are just some of the touchstones of everyday life, island style. Michele Falzone / Getty Images \nWailua Falls, Kaua'i. \nPretty much everything here feels easy-going, low-key and casual, bursting with genuine aloha and fun. You'll be equally welcome whether you're a globe-trotting surf bum, a beaming couple of fresh-faced honeymooners or a big, multi-generational family with rambunctious kids. Hawaii is as proud of its multicultural heritage as it is of island-born US president Barack Obama. On these islands, the descendants of ancient Polynesians, European explorers, American missionaries and Asian plantation immigrants mix and mingle. What's remarkable about contemporary Hawaii is that multiculturalism is the rule, not the exception. Boisterous arts and cultural festivals keep diverse community traditions alive, from Hawaiian hula and outrigger canoe races to Japanese taiko drumming. THE GREAT OUTDOORS Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park ( nps.gov/havo ) is the searing heart of the Big Island's heat. This is the land at its most raw and elemental; indeed, the entire island chain is the result of the volcanic processes on display in this region. No matter what the lava is doing, there is still plenty to see. When the enormous Kuhuku Unit in Kaʻu is factored in, HAVO is nearly the size of Oʻahu, and contains a highly varied landscape – black-lava deserts, rainforests, grassy coastal plains, snowy summits and more. The park is the Big Island's best place for hiking and camping, with about 150 miles of trails, but you don't have to break a sweat: good roads circle the caldera and take in the main highlights. \nRoadless, pristine and hauntingly beautiful, Na Pali Coast Wilderness State Park, is a 35-kilometre-long stretch of stark cliffs, white-sand beaches, turquoise coves and gushing waterfalls that links Kaua'i's northern and western shores. It's arguably the island's most magnificent natural sight. While fit trekkers tackle the exposed, undulating, slippery trail from Haʻena to Kalalau Valley, it's also possible to experience the coastline by kayak, raft or catamaran. Kalalau, Honopu, Awaʻawapuhi, Nuʻalolo and Miloliʻi are the five major valleys along the coast, each seemingly more stunning than the last. \nWith its tumbling waterfalls, lush slopes and rugged coasts, the Road to Hana is certainly beautiful. But it's the sense of earning the beauty that makes a drive on the road so special. Spanning the northeast shore of Maui, the legendary Hana Hwy ribbons tightly between jungle valleys and towering cliffs. Ignacio Palacios / Getty Images \nThe Na Pali Coast Wilderness State Park is roadless, pristine and hauntingly beautiful. \nAlong the way, 54 one-lane bridges mark nearly as many waterfalls, some tranquil and inviting, others so sheer they kiss you with spray as you drive past. It's ravishingly gorgeous, but certainly not easy. And there's more to the drive than beauty. When you're ready to get out and stretch your legs the real adventure begins: hiking trails climb into cool forests, short paths lead to Eden-like swimming holes, side roads wind down to sleepy seaside villages. If you've never tried smoked breadfruit, taken a dip in a spring-fed cave or gazed upon an ancient Hawaiian temple, set the alarm early – you've got a big day. WHISPERS OF THE PAST \nOnce a Hawaiian royal retreat, Waikiki is riding high on a new wave of effortlessly chic style these days. No longer just a beach destination for package tourists, this famous strand of sand is flowering, starting with a renaissance of Hawaiian music at beachfront hotels and resorts. In this concrete jungle of modern high-rises, you can, surprisingly, still hear whispers of Hawaii's past, from the chanting of hula troupes at Kuhio Beach to the legacy of Olympic gold medallist Duke Kahanamoku. Take a surfing lesson from a bronzed beach boy, then spend a lazy afternoon lying on Waikiki's golden sands. Before the sun sinks below the horizon, hop aboard a catamaran and sail off toward Diamond Head. Sip a sunset mai tai and be hypnotised by the lilting harmonies of slack key guitar, then mingle with the locals, who come here to party after dark too. \nThe World War II-era rallying cry \"Remember Pearl Harbour!\" that once mobilised a nation dramatically resonates on Oʻahu. It was here that the surprise Japanese attack on December 7, 1941, hurtled the US into war in the Pacific. Every year about 1.6 million tourists visit Pearl Harbour's unique collection of war memorials and museums, all clustered around a quiet bay where oysters were once farmed. One of the USA's most significant World War II sites, WWII Valour in the Pacific National Monument ( nps.gov/valr/ ) narrates the history of the Pearl Harbour attack and commemorates fallen service members. The monument is entirely wheelchair accessible. The main entrance also leads to Pearl Harbour's other parks and museums.

Published this month, RRP: NZ$36.99. \nTo fully experience Maui – or at least peer into its soul – make your way to the summit of Haleakalā. Like a yawning mouth, the huge crater opens beneath you, in all its raw volcanic glory, caressed by mist and, in the experience of a lifetime, bathed in the early light of sunrise. Ad Feedback \nLookouts on the crater's rim provide breathtaking views of the moonscape below, and the many cinder cones marching across it. The rest of the amazing Haleakalā National Park ( nps.gov/hale ), which is divided into two distinct sections, is all about interacting with this mountain of solid lava, and the rare life-forms that live upon it, some of them found only here. You can hike down into the crater, follow lush trails on the slopes, or put your mountain bike through its paces. For the ultimate adventure, get a permit, bring a tent and camp overnight beneath the stars. However you do it, you will leave having touched something much, much larger than yourself. \nThere are precious few towns on this sweet earth with the majestic natural beauty and barefoot soul of Hanalei. The bay is the thing, of course. Its half-dozen surf breaks swell to well above triple overhead and are the stuff of legend, partly because local surf gods such as the late Andy Irons cut their teeth here. \nBut even if you aren't here for waves, the beach, with its wide sweep of cream-coloured sand and magnificent jade mountain views, will demand your loving attention. When beach time is done, stroll around the pint-sized town, take a yoga class, snack on sushi or duck into a grass-shack tiki dive bar. It's true that Hanalei has more than its fair share of adults with Peter Pan syndrome and kids with seemingly Olympian athletic prowess. You'll see as many men in their 60s waxing their surfboards as you will groms with \"guns\" (ie big-wave surfboards). Which begs the query: why grow up at all when you can grow old in Hanalei? - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T20:26:41.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
