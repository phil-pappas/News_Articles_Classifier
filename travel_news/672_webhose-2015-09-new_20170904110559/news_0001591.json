It’s not because the maze was off-limits to guests; the hotel never had one at all—until now. \nFor the film, the hedge maze was filmed far from Colorado, on a sound stage in England, but guests still wanted the experience. So to celebrate 20 years of hotel ownership, John W. Cullen, the Stanley’s current owner, decided to act on the old “the customer is always right” adage and build visitors a labyrinth. \nAccording to the New York Times , the hotel hosted a competition and chose a layout designed by New York architect Mairim Dallaryan Standing. Planted in June, the juniper maze is now three feet tall, so children can play without getting irretrievably lost. It sits outside the enormous hotel just begging for a good old-fashioned game of hide-and-seek.
