But a lot has changed in the industry since then, with far more attractive areas of growth for airlines to pursue, and nothing to suggest lack of demand, which saw the no-frills airline axed seven years ago, has changed. Ad Feedback \nAs Lanham suggest, Palmerston North Airport has more to gain from building on its domestic connections, rather than getting hung up on what we used to have but don't have now. \nYes, it's been a pain to have to drive to Wellington to catch a flight to Australia, but at least the introduction of Jetstar should make the expense of flying via an Auckland connection more palatable. \nAnd domestic tourism is where greater and more realistic gains cane be made by Manawatu. Affordable routes that support this should be on the agenda of all stakeholders, rather than getting hung up on what we used to have but don't have now. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T22:34:50.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
