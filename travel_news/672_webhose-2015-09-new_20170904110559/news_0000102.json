In the 1970s and '80s, autopilots were primitive and required the constant attention of the pilots. They did reduce pilot workload, but the navigation was done manually using ground radio stations where possible, or internal inertial navigation for the long flights. Today the navigation system is integrated with the autopilot. The airplane flies a precise path through the sky and pilots know their ETA and fuel remaining throughout the flight.\nCommunication has improved with satellite communication and improved VHF radios.\nWeather radar is now color and shows areas of wind shear instead of just precipitation being a green return.\nPilots are now said to be systems operators; to some degree this is true, but the flying of the airplane remains a critical skill. The job has changed with requirements to work with computers to a much greater degree.\nQ: How much \"hands on\" flying do pilots do during takeoffs and landings? Did reliance on automation contribute to the 2013 Asiana crash in San Francisco?\n— Vince, Orange, Calif.\nA: Most landings and all takeoffs are done manually. In highly automated aircraft, the automation (autopilot) is engaged soon after takeoff (a few minutes) and disengaged within 5 miles of the destination.\nManual handling skills are a concern by many in aviation. Consequently, more and more operators are encouraging pilots to fly more manually. I enjoyed manual flying and would often wait until climbing through 10,000 feet before engaging the autopilot.\nIn the case of the SFO accident, there were many human factors that contributed. Improving manual handling skills was one of the recommendations made as a result of this tragedy.\nQ: What happened to the flight engineers needed for the older aircraft? Were they pilots also and just took other positions with the airlines?\n— Tim, Sacramento\nA: Many of the professional flight engineers retired. Those who were pilots, or who became pilots, transitioned to flying.\nJohn Cox is a retired airline captain with US Airways and runs his own aviation safety consulting company, Safety Operating Systems.\nLoading...\n2 CONNECT 14 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1FtjCoo TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://usat.ly/1FtjCoo", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/25b0f32bbf388f523e4fcf57de51132befc68e23/r=500x328/local/-/media/2015/09/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635787780642828281-ThinkstockPhotos-73635882.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1FtjCoo&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a65c331ec1ae01a9cbd36b573ccb934d51c21613/c=190-0-2810-1970&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635787780642828281-ThinkstockPhotos-73635882.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635787780642828281-ThinkstockPhotos-73635882.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1FtjCoo&text=Ask%20the%20Captain%3A%20How%20has%20technology%20changed%20a%20pilot%E2%80%99s%20job%3F&via=usatoday", "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dGk3WUFiTTl3VUNWX2d2bXRqVFZoUUE6MQ"], "published": "2015-09-27T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T01:36:28.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
