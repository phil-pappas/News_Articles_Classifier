It has identified career fields that have a positive public perception but in reality are much less attractive than they seem. \n\"While the most overrated jobs may have high salary potential, excitement and glamour, there are trade-offs to working in these professions that can include long hours, high pressure and stiff competition for positions or clients,\" said Kyle Kensing, online content editor at CareerCast. \nTo assemble the list, CareerCast examined 200 professions, taking into consideration inherent stress, competition, industry volatility and job turnover. Its base methodology for all of its jobs ratings is based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and includes four main criteria: environment, income, outlook and stress. \nThey say the grass is always greener on the other side, but in these eight jobs, you might find weeds. \n8. Advertising Account Executive Annual Median Salary: $115,750 Growth Outlook: 12% \nAdvertising account executives have an annual median salary of $115,750, which breaks down to $55.65 per hour. The field has a 12% growth outlook, about as fast as average, with 25,400 positions expected to be added from 2012 to 2022. According to the BLS, about a quarter of professionals in the arena work for advertising agencies. \nOne potential explanation for ad account executive positions being overrated: low morale in the advertising industry as a whole. A recent survey by Campaign US , a publication that covers the advertising sector, found that about a third of employees at advertising companies rate morale at their firms as low or dangerously low, and of those, 70% say they are job hunting. 1 of 8", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T15:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T12:55:06.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
