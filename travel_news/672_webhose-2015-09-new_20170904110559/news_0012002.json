Here are some of the best value routes.\n1. Sydney to Auckland: Return flight $356* — 22 per cent saving\nGood old Auckland. It’s one of the most popular overseas destination for Aussies. One of the best things about it is Tiritiri Matangi Island, just a short ferry journey from the city. Good tracks take you through the bush and around the island, which is home to several species of rare native birds. It’s a magical, natural experience. Just so you know, September heralds the week-long New Zealand Fashion Week and the Auckland on Water Boat Show.\n2. Sydney to Manila: Return flight $661* — 18 per cent saving\nThe capital of the Philippines can be a confronting place at times, which is probably why many tourists head straight out to visit the country’s island resorts, like Boracay. But, despite the poverty and the ramshackle look of the place, Manila offers some interesting churches, forts and Spanish-style architecture. One of the best places is the San Augustin Church, with its Mexican-style interior. Close to Manila is Puerto Galera, which has lovely beaches and some of the best snorkelling in the world. September is a wet season month, but it only rains in short heavy bursts, so don’t be too put off.\nAutumn colours at Daigoji Temple in Kyoto, Japan. Source: Supplied\n3. Sydney to Tokyo: Return flight $1,152* — 11 per cent saving\nAny visit to the bustling metropolis of Tokyo is wasted if you don’t visit the dynamic Tsukiji Fish Market. It’s the largest wholesale seafood market in the world, which is not surprising considering Japan’s love of sushi and sashimi. While you can visit at any time of the year, only Tokyo’s Nezujinja Shrine holds its Annual Grand Festival in September. People also go nuts for the Chestnut Festival at the Okunitama Jinja Shrine, where more dancing and festivities, as well as hot chestnuts, are on the menu.\n4. Melbourne to Gold Coast: Return flight $264* — 14 per cent saving\nMany people head to the Gold Coast for its family theme parks, like Dreamworld, Movie World, Sea World and Wet‘n’Wild. But, if you happen to be wandering along the Gold Coast’s Currumbin Beach between September 11 and 20, then you won’t miss the dozens of impressive sculptures built by local, national and international artists as part of the 13th annual Swell Sculpture Festival.\nYu Garden in Shanghai China.

Melbourne to Shanghai: Return flight $929* — 17 per cent saving\nDesign wise, Shanghai’s skyscrapers are some of the most impressive in the world, and rooftop bars and restaurants take advantage of the amazing views. Try the Peninsula Hotel or the Ritz-Carlton Shanghai for dizzying outlooks. The entire city celebrates in September as the Shanghai Tourism Festival comes to town. It’s a massive event, with a grand-scale parade of floats and performance troupes, firework displays and hundreds of other events across the city from September 11 to 15.\n6. Melbourne to Sydney: Return flight $172* — 25 per cent saving\nSeptember in Sydney is one of the best months. The harbour is at its glistening best, swimmers are braving the sea again, and there’s an optimism in the air at the thought of the approaching summer. The biggest event in Sydney at this time of the year is the Sydney Running Festival, which takes place on September 20. Around 30,000 runners take part in a marathon, a nine-kilometre run across the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and a 3.5-kilometre family run.\nVictoria Harbour in Hong Kong.

Perth to Hong Kong: Return flight $689* — 18 per cent saving\nHead to Hong Kong to fill up on fish balls and dim sum, before jumping on a narrow trolley bus or strolling its action-packed, neon-lit streets. Have a laugh or two at the 9th Annual Hong Kong International Comedy Festival between September 3 and 25. Or, have a flutter on the horses at the Season Opening Race Day on September 6 at the memorable Sha Tin Racecourse. It’s surrounded by imposing tower blocks, which makes for a unique visual experience.\n8. Perth to Ho Chi Minh City: Return flight $581* — 15 per cent saving\nHo Chi Minh City, or Saigon as it’s also known, is a crazy place which puts on the charm with its French colonial architecture and wide boulevards clogged with motorbikes. Don’t miss the War Remnants Museum for a fascinating perspective on the Vietnamese War, and a foodie night tour on the back of a motorbike. All of Vietnam celebrates the Mid-Autumn Festival on September 27 this year, with colourful parades, lion dances and the evening sky filled with thousands of giant floating paper candles. It’s quite a sight!\n9. Brisbane to Melbourne: Return flight $233* — 25 per cent saving\nMelbourne starts to warm up a little in September as spring starts to make itself known. After a winter of hiding away in the city’s marvellous cafes, bars and restaurants, Melburnians cast off their winter coats and celebrate! A visit at this time of year is a must, largely because of the Melbourne Fringe Festival, which kicks off on September 16. The city buzzes with 300 shows, from visual arts and cabaret to dance and comedy.\nBridge over Singel canal in Amsterdam. Source: Supplied\n10. Adelaide to Amsterdam: Return flight $1,621* — 13 per cent saving\nSeptember sees Amsterdam clinging to the last rays of summer as they glitter off bicycle frames, canals and the windows of narrow houses with gabled facades. On September 6, thousands of hardy swimmers jump into the water for the Amsterdam City Swim, while from September 3 to 13 the entire city becomes a stage for the Amsterdam Fringe Festival. Expect live art, theatre, musical theatre, comedy and dance.\n*Prices are accurate at time of publishing\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=10+best+value+for+money+airline+routes&c=WHERE+can+Aussie+travellers+go+to+get+the+best+airfare+deals+this+September%3F+We+reveal+the+top+destinations+that+stretch+your+dollar+further.&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/the-best-value-airline-routes-for-aussie-travellers-this-september/story-fn6yjmoc-1227507460933?sv=75f410084ab4e97540140b3fb669e967", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/the-best-value-airline-routes-for-aussie-travellers-this-september/story-fn6yjmoc-1227507460933?sv=75f410084ab4e97540140b3fb669e967&h=10+best+value+for+money+airline+routes", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/the-best-value-airline-routes-for-aussie-travellers-this-september/story-fn6yjmoc-1227507460933?sv=75f410084ab4e97540140b3fb669e967&title=10+best+value+for+money+airline+routes", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/the-best-value-airline-routes-for-aussie-travellers-this-september/story-fn6yjmoc-1227507460933?sv=75f410084ab4e97540140b3fb669e967", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/the-best-value-airline-routes-for-aussie-travellers-this-september/story-fn6yjmoc-1227507460933?sv=75f410084ab4e97540140b3fb669e967", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/the-best-value-airline-routes-for-aussie-travellers-this-september/story-fn6yjmoc-1227507460933?sv=75f410084ab4e97540140b3fb669e967&title=10+best+value+for+money+airline+routes", "http://www.skyscanner.com.au/"], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T03:56:48.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
