He read physics at the University of Sussex followed by a DPhil (PhD) at the Clarendon Laboratory, Oxford. He joined NPL in 1975 and is a world expert on atomic clocks. I might have been a chemist if I could have got the practicals to work out, but I always seemed to end up with twice or half as much stuff as I should have had. I reckoned that twiddling knobs on boxes would be easier to control so I switched to physics. The lasers field was only a decade old when I began investigating new types of laser in my doctoral research. Afterwards I wanted to see how laser physics could be applied to solve real-world problems. NPL provided just the right balance between academe and industry so I got a job there in 1975 – and never left. The application we found for lasers was in atomic clocks, which had first been demonstrated at NPL in 1955. Conventional atomic clocks use microwaves to probe caesium atoms. They were already extremely accurate – to around one second in 10,000 million (1010) – but by using lasers to super-cool the caesium atoms we were able to increase the accuracy by about a million times (to 2 in 1016). That’s about one second in 160million years. There are probably tens of thousands of atomic clocks in use now and most of us already benefit from them. Satellite navigation relies on them – there are two in every navigation satellite plus more on the ground, providing the level of accuracy that can pinpoint our position to within 20 metres anywhere within satellite coverage. They’re also used in telecommunications to synchronise huge volumes of voice and data traffic, and to aid communication with deep-space probes. Now we’re making atomic clocks even more accurate. Now we’re making atomic clocks even more accurate. Our breakthrough was to make lasers emit light at a very stable frequency, but much higher than microwave frequencies, effectively giving us faster clock “ticks”. Everything else being equal, the accuracy of an atomic clock is proportional to its operating frequency. Visible light has a frequency roughly 100,000 times higher than that of microwaves, and we’ve already demonstrated that atomic clocks using light can be more accurate than those using microwaves. Does anyone need that level of accuracy? Well, it could potentially make satnav accurate to centimetres rather than metres, and significantly help synchronise high volume information transfer over telecoms networks. It could enable deep space navigation over much larger distances, and enable scientists to increase their understanding of physics here on earth. There’s also a lot of interest in “inertial” navigation and timing – calculating the exact distance a vehicle or ship has travelled without reference to external things such as landmarks or satellites. I’m not sure you’ll ever have an atomic wristwatch. But microwave-based atomic clocks are available in matchbox sizes and we’re looking at how to make optical atomic clocks no bigger than a holdall. I’m not actually very time-conscious. I tend to be rather last-minute and try to cram things in. People worry that I’m going to miss planes and things – although I never have yet.
