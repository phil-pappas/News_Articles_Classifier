The company notified its existing customers that there will be a no-cost, no-additional-hardware upgrade to currently deployed VoyagerECKs, and that equipment purchased today will be useable in CSfC-compliant environments. The details of the CSfC roadmap will be revealed at Klas Telecom's annual Users Forum that is scheduled to take place in March 2016 . Klas Telecom Services President and CEO Dave Huisenga disclosed that the roadmap contains a reverse-compatible solution agreeable to the modular, scalable and interoperability design principles upon which the Voyager product line was built. \"Our customers want to be able to leverage the latest commercial encryption technology to transmit sensitive data and we're very pleased that we can rapidly respond to this market demand,\" Huisenga said. \"Voyager's modular design in combination with our robust, in-house software development and engineering teams allow us to deliver technology upgrades to our customers' existing products at very little to no cost, instead of forcing them to invest in new hardware. In this way, we protect our customers' existing investments while at the same time enabling them to remain up to date.\" 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:10:36.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
