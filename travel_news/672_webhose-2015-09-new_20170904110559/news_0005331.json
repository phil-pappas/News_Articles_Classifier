Over the last 5 months, 21 nine-car Pendolino trains have had one of their 1st class carriages converted to standard class (creating a net increase of 2,100 seats). The trains also received a major interior refresh and a deep clean as part of the work.\nThe project, which took place at Alstom’s depot in Oxley, Wolverhampton, saw the creation of 32 new jobs and benefitted local businesses in the supply chain to the tune of £1m.\nPhil Whittingham, Managing Director at Virgin Trains, commented, “Our main focus is always our customers and their needs. We have seen demand for our services increase significantly, with more than 34 million journeys made on our trains last year, something that we are very proud of. Converting these First Class carriages to Standard allows us to respond to requests from passengers for more seats on our busiest routes. We’ve also given our Pendolinos a well deserved refresh and customers are already seeing the benefits.”\nAs part of a wider fleet upgrade project, each of the nine-car Pendolinos also received a major interior refresh and a deep clean when the conversion took place. The work was the result of feedback from Net Promoter Score data 1 , Virgin Trains employees, extensive customer research and collaborative discussions between Alstom and Virgin Trains. It aims to ensure that the Pendolino fleet delivers on passengers’ expectations of the Virgin Trains brand.\nNow that all of the nine-car trains have been upgraded, the remaining 35 eleven-car Pendolinos will also undergo the major interior refresh and a deep clean with the full Pendolino fleet completed by mid-2016.\nSource:- Virgin Trains", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T20:06:28.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
