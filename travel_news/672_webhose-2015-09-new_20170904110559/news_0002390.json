Travelers look to Gray Line, the global leader in sightseeing, as a name they know and trust. The familiar blue and white diamond logo is a symbol of reliability, shared by over 150 members in major cities throughout the world, each independently owned and operated.\nIn 1981, Brush Hill obtained a sightseeing license in Boston, which opened the door for new opportunities in the revived tourism and convention marketplace. In the early ‘90s, the Gray Line Sightseeing Franchise or “diamond” was awarded to Brush Hill. A full schedule of one-day Boston and New England tours continues to be offered as well as the Beantown Trolley shuttle, a San Francisco-style trackless trolley car, with a fully narrated 105-minute tour of Boston and point-to-point shuttle service along the tour route.\nAs the local expert in transportation, one of Brush Hill's specialties is in providing shuttle services. The company coordinates pick-ups for all size groups and shuttles passengers to and from their destination point. Brush Hill’s charter services are used frequently for corporate, academic or special events, including weddings, proms or reunions, for organizations as varied as the Boston Red Sox, John Hancock, and many area high schools and colleges (for both academic and athletic purposes). In addition, Brush Hill participates in the large shuttle movements for the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority (MCCA) and the Greater Boston Visitor and Convention Bureau (GBVCB). The company also runs a number of routes to Foxwoods, and operates the Boston-based Red Beantown Trolley. Brush Hill Transportation Company is owned by the Anzuoni family, who also own Plymouth & Brockton Street Railway Company.\nThe Anzuoni family has been at the forefront of the transportation business since 1920 when George A. Anzuoni, Sr. founded Service Bus Lines. Service Bus was the first motorcoach company to use rubber tires on the eastern seaboard. Brush Hill Transportation Company was acquired in 1954. George A. Anzuoni, Sr. delegated his son Larry to take control of the commuter line. It originally offered a mode of transportation to domestics employed by the large estates on Brush Hill Road in Milton, Mass. The company also provided transit service on two commuter lines. Brush Hill’s charter business began to grow and soon had many prominent businesses, schools, senior recreation departments and individual clients on board.\nBrush Hill Transportation is located at 435 High Street, Randolph, Massachusetts.
