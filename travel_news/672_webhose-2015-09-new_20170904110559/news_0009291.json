The Inskip Point sinkhole swallowed up 200x50m of the coast.

He said a large channel between Inskip Point and Fraser Island to its north regularly built up a “shoulder” of sand and fell away. \n“This is a big channel, perhaps 50 or 100 metres. It’s just a very unstable cliff of sand,” he said. \n“It seems to me very poor planning that they’ve allowed development so close to such a vulnerable area.” Pictures: Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service Source: Supplied The Inskip Point sinkhole.

The sinkhole dragged a car, caravan, tents and a camping trailer into the water.

Inskip Point has long been a popular tourist spot.

A sinkhole opened up in the same site in 2011.
