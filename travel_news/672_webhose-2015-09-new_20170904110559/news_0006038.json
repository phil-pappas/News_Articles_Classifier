Michael Matheson said Janet McKay’s family deserves answers and an inquiry is being staged into how a public tip-off to an officer about the 88-year-old’s whereabouts was not passed on to detectives. The Justice Minister argued the failure was not directly comparable with the M9 tragedy, when a woman was left dying in a car beside her dead partner after they had crashed off the motorway, as it did not involve an error in a police call centre. Five days after the original tip-off, the same sighting of Mrs McKay was phoned in to a call centre and this time it was passed on to investigating officers. They found her body on Thursday morning and it was formally identified on Friday. But opposition parties said that in both cases vital information was not passed on, with tragic consequences, and argued that Mr Matheson’s mishandling of the M9 scandal showed that he cannot “hide behind front-line officers”. Sir Stephen House, Police Scotland’s Chief Constable, has recently announced he is stepping down early in the wake of a series of scandals. The Scottish Government appointed him after approving the merger of the previous regional police forces. Mrs McKay, who suffered from dementia, was last seen on September 16 by neighbours in the Knightswood area of Glasgow. Her family made a desperate appeal for information as police mounted a missing person operation. It was reported yesterday that the original sighting of Mrs McKay was made by a dog walker. Calum Steele, general secretary of the Scottish Police Federation, said the tip-off was given to a young officer with very little experience, who was \"exceptionally busy\" and forgot to pass on \"second or third-hand information\". Her body was eventually found in the Clydebank area, around 14 miles from her home. George McKay, her son, yesterday refused to criticise the police investigation into her disappearance. But Police Scotland admitted the mistake, apologised to her family and referred itself to the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC), the independent watchdog, which is staging an inquiry. Police stopped motorists on Alderman Road in Glasgow as they searched for Janet McKay on Wednesday Photo: Andrew Milligan/PA Mr Matheson offered Mrs McKay’s friends and family his condolences and said it was important the investigation, which will be directed by the Lord Advocate, is “very thorough and timely”. He told BBC Radio Scotland he did not want to prejudice the findings but said the police “are clear that this is information that wasn't actually passed to a call centre in the first place and then when it eventually was passed to the call centre it was then actioned immediately to the investigation team.” But Graeme Person, Scottish Labour’s justice spokesman and a former senior police officer, said there were two lessons the minister must learn from the M9 tragedy. “The first lesson is that blaming an individual officer is not good enough. We know from the M9 case that systemic failures meant it was only a matter of time before something went badly wrong ,” he said. \"The second lesson is that we need the Justice Minister Michael Matheson to take a hands-on approach. Government ministers who created Police Scotland must not hide behind front-line officers.\" Willie Rennie, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, said: “It's really important that we understand how the information flows throughout Police Scotland so that we are actually reassured that this is a rare error, rather than a system problem.\" John Yuill and Lamara Bell were in a car that crashed off the M9 motorway Photo: Police Scotland Mr McKay told BBC Scotland: \"We've been very happy with the way the police have dealt with it – they've been very supportive to us. Any wider issues are a matter for Police Scotland but we have no criticisms to make of them.\" In a statement issued through police, the family later said they were \"devastated\" and that their \"dear mother\" would be \"sadly missed by everyone who knew her\". They added: \"We would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the support from the many officers involved in the search to locate our mother. We have been constantly updated on the progress of the investigation throughout.\" However, the lawyer representing the five-year-old son of Lamara Bell, the woman left dying in the M9 crash, described the latest blunder as “shocking”. Aamer Anwar said: “The Scottish Government needs to get a grip. We have already had a chief constable step down, the system is in a fundamental meltdown.” telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T20:40:53.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
