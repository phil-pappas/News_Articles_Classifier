These activities include:\nReef Discovery Snorkel – Escorted by the Marine Educator, guests may enjoy a 30-minute boat ride to a diverse area of the coral reef where they’ll snorkel with their own private guide to uncover the secrets of its beautiful marine life. Marvellous Mangroves Snorkel – Prominently featured throughout the Resort and accessible directly from the beach, the protected mangroves are a haven for marine sightings and a perfect place for a guided snorkel. Marine Educator Hire – Available for any guests booking a private boat excursion, the Marine Educator will accompany the boating excursion to guide all snorkelling sessions, sharing their marine knowledge throughout. Underwater Camera Hire – Guests may capture their own underwater findings through rental of the WiseOceans camera and transfer their files directly to their laptop or mobile device upon return.\nCommenting on the new partnership, Director of WiseOceans Lindsay Sullivan says: “There is so much beauty in the lagoons of Mauritius, and yet few people are aware of the diversity of marine life that exists in the mangroves and coral reefs found within them. Fewer still realise how important these habitats are to Mauritius, and this is something we’d like to change. Our aim is raise awareness of the incredible life they host, allowing people to discover a new world of marine life in Mauritius. We are delighted to work with Four Seasons Resort Mauritius at Anahita to engage resort guests, staff and the wider community to achieve this.”\nFunded through guest donations as part of the Resort’s new Environmental Conservation Programme, the Marine Discovery Programme allows the ongoing monitoring of the health of the coral reefs and mangroves in the surrounding lagoon. All collected data will be submitted to the Ministry of Fisheries in Mauritius on an ongoing basis. WiseOceans will also hold events within the local community to reach an even wider audience.\nFour Seasons Resort Mauritius at Anahita will become the second Four Seasons resort to partner with WiseOceans, with Four Seasons Resort Seychelles having worked with the marine education experts since 2012, leading to the development of its Petite Anse Reef Restoration Project, which was launched earlier this year.\nWiseOceans is a global marine conservation and education company that employs three core strategies, striving towards a global future with healthier oceans: to educate, to conserve and to involve. With world-class ocean outreach activities and innovative restoration projects, WiseOceans was founded on the belief that education is the way to achieve conservation of our oceans in the long-term, and as such, guests also have the opportunity to enjoy a wider choice of payable marine activities in private sessions with the WiseOceans Marine Educator.\nSource:- Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T08:07:46.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
