But with eight out of 10 students worrying about making ends meet, creating one could actually be the secret to making your student experience more enjoyable. Jake Butler from student finance site Save the Student says “Budgeting when you go to university isn’t just important – it’s vital. “ Having a solid financial plan won’t magic any more money into the pot, but it can help you prepare for what’s to come and alleviate some of the stress.” If you’re getting your funding through a loan, it can be tricky to ensure your bank balance doesn’t run into the red. Rob Ellis, chair of the National Association of Student Money Advisers (NASMA) and a financial information adviser at Swansea University adds: “Student loans are paid in three instalments, one each term, which makes it harder to manage your money than getting monthly payments like you would with a job. “For example, you get paid in September and that has to last until the next installment in January. Every year I see students who don’t fully grasp this and end up having a very difficult December.” \"I always say that alcohol should come with a wealth warning. When you’ve had a few drinks, your spending inhibitions go, and it’s easy to get carried away.\" Martin Lewis So how do you get started? It’s down to you how you want to record your finances – be it with old-fashioned pen and paper or on an Excel spreadsheet (you can find a template to get you started on the Save the Student website). Either way, the concept is simple: note down all your monthly incomings (divide loan instalments into monthly chunks) and expected outgoings, and then ensure that the numbers match. Ellis says: “Your key outgoings are what we call ‘priority costs’, as a failure to pay these can have a serious impact on your life. “These will include rent, utility bills, phone bills, TV licence, council tax and food. After that, look at all the other costs that you’ll need to pay, such as insurance policies (very much recommended), toiletries, household products and course and travel costs.” Ellis also advises that it’s a smart move to have a separate bank account for any important, regular costs and run it on direct debits, so you won’t accidentally spend your rent, for instance. The money that’s left is for fun and leisure, such as gym memberships, clothes, nights out and general spending. Fix figures in your head for how much you have avail-able for these each month.

It’s key that you allocate some money in your budget each month for unexpected one-off costs, as well as simply to save for the future, if possible. Butler suggests calculating the amount of money you have left over after paying for essentials and putting up to 50 per cent of that into savings. Of course, how much you can save will depend on your personal circumstances. But Ellis notes that even if you could set aside just £10 a week that would give you an emergency fund of more than £500 in a year. Once you’re settled in at university it’s good to keep a regular track of your outgoings to ensure that you’re sticking to your budget. \"If you do run into trouble, never be tempted to pay for financial advice.\" According to Butler, “A monthly check-in is enough to give you a clue about how you’re coping and a good time to assess whether you’re getting the best deals on your bills or whether you should switch providers.\" Even better, he adds, is to get into a daily habit of spending a few minutes a day totting up your expenditure to give you the best chance of managing if money’s tight. Free app Toshl Finance can help to keep you on track. One clever trick for staying on course is adopting an “envelope budget”. As Butler explains: “Get the cash out at the start of the month or week for all your spending that’s not covered by direct debit, then divvy it all up between envelopes labelled for different areas such as food, leisure and so on. “When you need the cash, take it out, write on the front what you spent and how much is left. The deal is, you only spend what’s available for that month or week. There’s something about seeing the cash in front of you that helps you hold on to it for longer.” If you do run into trouble, never be tempted to pay for financial advice. Instead, seek help from your university money adviser, who will be able to guide you and provide information about any hardship funding for which you may be eligible. The sooner you speak up, the sooner you’ll get back into the black. The lowdown on your loan Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, has a few pointers on how to make your student loan stretch that little bit further: \"Financially speaking, getting a student loan is a no-win, no-fee situation. Assuming you’re taking a loan for your tuition and a loan for your living costs, you’ll only start making repayments once you’re earning more than £21,000, and the amount you repay is proportionate – the more you earn, the more you have to repay. “Many people worry wrongly that they won’t get a good enough job to pay off their loan. But if that’s the case, you simply won’t have to make repayments. “The problem as I see it isn’t that loans are too big – it’s that they’re too small. It’s important to remember that even with the maintenance loan you’re given to cover your living expenses, it might be difficult for you to meet the costs of living in halls, say. Martin Lewis Photo: ANDREW CROWLEY “If you don’t have parental support, you may need to get a job. Thankfully, these days you’re encouraged to work while at university, rather than it being frowned on – employers are keen to see it on your CV. “If you find you’re struggling to make ends meet, don’t keep it to yourself. Your university should have a welfare office, and they’ll be able to tell you about hardship funds and access funds. “There are also a couple of really good student scholarship websites – try scholarship-search.org.uk or studentcashpoint.co.uk. “Freshers’ Week is the first time you’ll have had access to independent funds of any size, and you’ll want to go out and spend, but it’s a mistake to splurge straight away. “If you really have to, the time to do it is when you’re about to get your next loan instalment and have cash left over because you’ve budgeted well. You don’t want to be living on tinned food for the next six weeks. “I always say that alcohol should come with a wealth warning. When you’ve had a few drinks, your spending inhibitions go, and it’s easy to get carried away. “The next morning you’ll wake up with a financial hangover as well as a headache – so do be careful.” telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T14:29:59.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
