As the country’s largest multipurpose indoor arena with a seating capacity for 55,000 pax, Philippine Arena is expected to appeal to international events, such as the Katy Perry concert which was held there in May. \nMarketing materials are also prepared for the foreign market. \nAcknowledging that the venue’s location in Bocaue, Bulacan can pose a challenge, Enrile said Philippine Arena is building its own transport terminal to improve accessibility from the heart of Manila. \nPhilippine Arena already has its own exit on the North Luzon Expressway for quicker access from Manila, and is served by shuttle buses that pick visitors from some points in the city. \nPhilippine Arena is the centerpiece of a massive multipurpose development called Ciudad de Victoria which also houses the 20,000-seat Philippine Sports Stadium. The indoor Philippine Sports Centre will likely opened in 2016, while hotels and other tourism-related facilities are being planned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T09:11:49.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
