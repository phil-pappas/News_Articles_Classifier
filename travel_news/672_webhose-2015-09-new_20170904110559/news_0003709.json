These join the previously released XS-GS6921 rear speakers, XS-GS1621 and XS-GS1621C front speakers, XS-GSW121 and XS-GSW121D subwoofers, and XM-GS100 mono amplifier to create an unsurpassed in-car audio listening experience. The head unit RSX-GS9 is natively compatible with DSD, an audio format that reproduces music with unprecedented accuracy. All components will be available in December from Sony authorized car audio specialists.\nSony makes it possible to enjoy higher sound quality music by applying unique audio technologies that bring listeners closer to the spirit and intent of the artist's original performance. The RSX-GS9 in-car digital media player joins a growing line of Sony products designed to provide consumers the best way to enjoy a fully immersive, Hi-Res Audio experience at home or on the go.\nRSX-GS9 digital media player – Where attraction turns into fascination\nThe RSX-GS9 is the latest car audio player that is natively compatible with DSD (5.6MHz/1bit, 2.8MHz/1bit), an audio format that reproduces music with unprecedented accuracy. For non-Hi-Res Audio files Sony's DSEE HX™ (Digital Sound Enhancement Engine) upscales the audio to maximize your enjoyment no matter which format your music is stored in. Advanced connectivity features such as LDAC™ supported Bluetooth®/ NFC™ in connection with Sony's SongPal App, two USB (Type A) slots and a USB micro-B (USB DAC) ensure that you can play your music from a variety of media storage, including smartphones, USB flash drives, and MP3 players. (The SongPal App can be downloaded from Google's Marketplace as well as Apple's App Store .)\nAll of the RSX-GS9's components – from the operational amplifiers to the clock generator – have been put together to maximize sound clarity and quality while minimizing electro-magnetic noise and vibration. They are enclosed by a super rigid dual-layer chassis resulting in an anti-resonance, low interference design. Most notably, Sony incorporated the ES9018S, the high performance 32-bit audio D/A converter by ESS Technology, Inc. The D/A converter translates your music files to analogue signals in an impressive dynamic range of up to 135dB and THD+N (total harmonic distortion and noise) of -120dB to deliver a clarity and presence that rivals live performances.\nSony's RSX-GS9 in-car digital media player has a premium design and finish. The digital media players' clean, single-shell front panel design is made from machine-cut, hairline-finished 14mm aluminum. This is complemented by an easily visible OLED display, backlit selection keys and a large aluminum-trimmed volume dial that fits seamlessly in the middle on the panel.\nXM-GS4 4ch amplifier – Fine detail across the whole spectrum\nSony's new XM-GS4 4-channel amplifier is another key component for the ideal sound reproduction as it transforms low-power audio signals into gigantic sonic waves that let you dive into your musical pleasures. With its incredibly wide frequency response from 10 to 100KHz it consistently delivers powerful, voluminous tones that can be further adjusted to your liking thanks to variable low pass/high pass filters that allow for easy optimization of crossover frequencies to perfectly match with your system configuration.\nXS-GS1 super tweeter – Brings music to life\nNo audio system is complete without speakers that bring your music to life. The XS-GS1 super tweeter joins the previously released XS-GS6921 rear speakers, XS-GS1621 and XS-GS1621C front speakers, XS-GSW121 and XS-GSW121D subwoofers, and XM-GS100 mono amplifier, featuring Sony's original MRC (Mica Reinforced Cellular) and MRC Honeycomb diaphragms for wide dynamic range, resolution, and smooth fluctuation of sound pressure through all frequency ranges.\nWhen it comes to ultra-high frequency sound, Sony's premium XS-GS1 25mm soft dome super tweeter is the ideal addition to realize the Hi-Res Audio experience in your car. Wide-open grill nets and smooth sloped front baffles maximize the speaker's sound radiation properties. In addition, the XS-GS1's can be installed to face the windshield rather than the listener, thereby increasing the dispersion and quality of high pitched notes to smoothly deliver delicate highs that accentuate a harmonic, soulful sound.\nFor more information, please visit www.sony.com/news .\nSelected technical specifications\nRSX-GS9\nPre Out\nFront/Rear/Sub\nHigh Voltage Pre Out\nYes\nSub Out\nYes\nSub-Woofer adjust (LEVEL)\nYes\nSub-Woofer Phase\nYes\nAux-In\nYes (Front, Rear(Hi-level in))\nUSB\nYes (Type A: for Front/Rear, Micro-B for Front)\nTime Alignment\nYes (Adjustable for DSD, PCM)\nEQ\nYes(EQ10)\nSound Adjustment Features\nLoudness, Balance, Fader\nHigh Pass Filter\nYes (OFF/50/63/79/99/125/158/198/250[Hz])\nLow Pass Filter\nYes (PCM:OFF/50/63/79/99/125/158/198/250, DSD:OFF/150[Hz])\nDigital Sound Enhancement Engine HX (DSEE HX)\nYes\nTuner Feature\nPreset\nFM18/MW6/LW6\nAUX in Feature\nLevel Adjustment\nYes (-8dB - +18dB)\nDisplay Panel\nDisplay Device (LCD/FL/OLED/TFT)\nOLED (with acryl, Monochrome)\nKey Illumination\nYes\nDimmer Adjust\nON/OFF/AUTO\nOptical output\nYes (96kHz, 48kHz)\nRemote Input\nYes\nMusic Player Direct Connectivity\nMusic player Control Feature\nBasic Control Features\nPause, Resume (Depend on Music player)\nCODEC (for iPod)\nDepend on iPod\nPassenger Control\nfor iPhone/iPod\nYes (Always ON)\nBluetooth Features\nBluetooth Specifications\nVersion\n3.0\nSecure Simple Pairing\nYes\nNFC One-touch connection\nYes\nSmartphone Connectivity Feature\nAdvanced Smartphone Menu Navigation\nNo\nRF ON/OFF\nYes\nEcho/Noise Canceller\nYes (Mode1/Mode2)\nRing Alert Select\nYes (Internal/Cellular)\nRing Volume Level Control\nYes\nCall Volume Level Control\nYes\nMic Gain Adjustment\nYes (Low/Middle/High)\nVoice Control\nNo\nExternal Microphone\nSupplied\nSupported Applications\nSongPal (iOS), SongPal (Android)\nBluetooth Audio Feature\nAudio Codec\nSBC/AAC/LDAC\nPause\nYes\nCue/Rev\nYes\nTrack +/-\nYes\nAudio Level Adjustment\nYes (-6dB - +6dB)\nUSB Features\nUSB Profile\nMass Storage Class Device\nYes\nBattery Charge\nUSB BC1.2 Compliant\nMass Storage Class Connection\n(USB Type-A)\nRepeat\nOFF/TRACK/ALBUM/ALL (Controllable by APP or Remote)\nShuffle\nOFF/ALBUM/DEVICE (Controllable by APP or Remote)\nCODEC (for USB)\nMP3/WMA/WAV/AAC/FLAC/ALAC/AIFF/DSF/DSDIFF\nSampling Frequency\nBit Depth\nUp to 192kHz/24bit for WAV/FLAC/AIFF/ALAC/\n2.8MHz/1bit for DSF/DSDIFF *DSD=>PCM convert\nList Browsing (Folders/Files)\nYes (Controllable by SongPal™)\nUSB DAC\n(USB micro-B)\nSampling Frequency\nBit Depth\nUp to 192KHz/24bit for PCM\n5.6MHz/1Bit, 2.8MHz/1Bit for DSD\nDSD Data Interface\nDoP, ASIO Native\nNative DSD Playback\nYes\nGapless Playback\nYes\nTuner chart\nTuning Range\nFM (MHz)\n87.5-108\nMW (kHz)\n531-1602\nLW (kHz)\n153-279\nSony, LDAC and Walkman are registered trademarks or trademarks of Sony Corporation.\niPhone, iPod, iPod classic, iPod nano, iPod touch, and Siri are trademarks of Apple Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries.\nThe N-Mark is a trademark or registered trademark of NFC Forum, Inc. in the United States and in other countries.
