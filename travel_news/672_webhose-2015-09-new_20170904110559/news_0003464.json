The TLX SH-AWD has an anticipated EPA fuel-economy rating of 21/31/25 1 .\nAcura Precision-Handling Technologies\nTwo-wheel-drive TLX models, with either the 2.4-liter or 3.5-liter engine, come equipped with the latest iteration of Acura P-AWS. The P-AWS system was integrated into the fundamental chassis design from the earliest stages of development, allowing engineers to take full advantage of its independent left and right rear-wheel toe angle control to enhance overall handling precision, low-speed maneuverability and high-speed stability.\nThe TLX SH-AWD features a hydraulically controlled new generation of Acura's acclaimed torque vectoring SH-AWD ® . The rear-drive unit is constantly overdriven by 2.7-percent, providing torque-vectoring effect across a broad spectrum of driving situations, enhancing cornering capability at lower speeds and in tighter-radius corners.\nNear-limit and high speed maneuvering capabilities of both the P-AWS and SH-AWD models are enhanced by the use of Agile Handling Assist (AHA), which utilizes the TLX's Vehicle Stability Assist and premium 6-piston brake modulator to create a yaw moment (a vehicle turning force), helping the driver smoothly and easily trace the desired line with smaller steering-wheel inputs. AHA stabilizes the car earlier than conventional VSA, resulting in more agile and engaging dynamic performance in everyday driving conditions.\nAll TLX models also feature the latest development of Acura's Integrated Dynamics System (IDS), which allows drivers to customize their driving experience through four selectable modes – ECON, Normal, Sport and Sport+. Depending on the setting, IDS will adjust power-steering effort, throttle response, transmission shift logic, HVAC system operation, and the control logic for either the P-AWS or SH-AWD systems. The Sport+ mode, a first for Acura, unlocks the full performance potential of the TLX with the most aggressive settings in all areas.\nSafety and Driver-Assistive Technologies\nThe TLX also advances Acura's reputation for delivering cutting-edge safety and driver-assistive technologies. The TLX deploys a cooperative monocular camera and millimeter wave radar system that expands both the fidelity and scope of the vehicle's road-sensing capabilities. This fusion of camera and radar technology underpins the TLX's available Collision Mitigation Braking System TM (CMBS), which can provide enhanced car-to-car and car-to-pedestrian collision mitigation, while also enhancing the capabilities of the Adaptive Cruise Control.\nThe TLX utilizes Acura Road Departure Mitigation (RDM), which is included with the Advance Package. RDM uses the monocular camera to recognize painted lane lines, Botts' Dots and Cat Eye markers to determine lane boundaries. When the vehicle's current travelling direction would cause it to stray from a detected lane, the system warns the driver and assists by applying corrective steering input and, if required, braking force to help the driver maintain their current lane.\nAdditional standard and available driver-assistive features include blind spot information (BSI), Lane Departure Warning (LDW), Forward Collision Warning (FCW), Expanded View Driver's Side Mirror, Lane Keeping Assist (LKAS) and Rear Cross Traffic Monitor (CTM).\nThe TLX also employs Acura's next-generation Advanced Compatibility Engineering (ACE) body structure, along with advanced supplemental restraint systems – including front, side, side-curtain and driver's knee airbags – to provide a high level of occupant protection in a wide spectrum of collision scenarios.\nBody and Chassis\nThe TLX platform (body and chassis) was designed from the ground up to support and enhance the vehicle's outstanding driving dynamics, luxury-sedan refinement, class-leading fuel efficiency and high-level collision safety performance.\nThe chassis features a four-wheel independent suspension system – McPherson Strut front and multi-link rear – with optimized geometry and Amplitude Reactive Dampers for improved ride comfort and handling performance. The TLX's Motion-Adaptive Electronic Power Steering delivers a high level of steering precision and responsiveness while aiding fuel efficiency. It also works cooperatively with the vehicle's Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) traction-control system to help the driver maintain vehicle control in slippery road conditions.\nThe TLX's unit body utilizes advanced lightweight materials, including ultra-high-strength steels, aluminum (hood, bumper beams and front subframe) and magnesium (steering hangar beam), to minimize weight while providing for a high degree of rigidity that benefits both dynamic performance and occupant safety. Also incorporated into the body is the next generation Advanced Compatibility Engineering (ACE) frontal body structure, and a one-piece, hot-stamped-steel door stiffener ring. The sleek body design is also optimized for class-leading aerodynamic efficiency.\nFor a premium interior experience, Acura engineers paid special attention to body sealing to provide a quiet and relaxing cabin experience. This includes the application of acoustic spray foam, which is applied in 10 critical locations throughout the body. Additional noise-reducing features include triple door seals, the expanded application of body sealing and sound absorptive materials, an acoustic glass windshield, and electronic Active Noise Control (ANC).\nFor More Information\nConsumer information is available at www.acura.com .
