This is why Britain’s Healthiest Company is so great, in that it recognises the importance of the workplace, and treats it as the starting point for making improvements in the health of corporate Britain. As someone whose career has relied on physical fitness and health, I am always acutely aware of the importance of a healthy lifestyle, and the huge impact that health has on performance, and therefore the ability to do one’s job out on the pitch. The outstanding progress being made in the world of sports science and nutrition has meant that people are now much more aware of the effects that their lifestyle has on their health, and, most importantly, are challenging themselves to improve it. The results of Britain’s Healthiest Company show that it is not only professional athletes who rely on their health and well-being as a driver of their success. It's not only professional athletes who rely on their health for their success People in all manner of professions, some of which you would not automatically associate with health, are shown to be more productive, more enthusiastic about their work and ultimately perform better at their jobs because they are taking better care of their health through their diet, getting more exercise, and giving up or cutting down on their smoking and drinking. This should not necessarily be a surprise - we are increasingly viewing health holistically, and the positive effects of exercise and good nutrition on our mental well-being, have, for example, been well documented. However, it is for me the degree to which a healthy lifestyle is shown to affect productivity that is a surprise, transforming people’s professional lives. Staying fit and healthy is not easy, particularly when people have to try to fit it around their daily work – all too often a healthy lifestyle is viewed as being of secondary importance and something for individuals to focus on in their spare time. While your personal health is, of course, something that only you can really make a decision to change, something that must not be underestimated is the influence of those around you. Throughout my career I viewed success as something I had to strive towards through my own hard work, but that was also founded on the efforts of the team around me. Companies are no different, and it is great to see that many have witnessed a culture shift towards producing an environment that encourages and enables individuals to perform to the best of their ability and realise their potential.
