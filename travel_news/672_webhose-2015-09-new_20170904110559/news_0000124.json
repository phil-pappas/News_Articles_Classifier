Once out of love, it’s quite hard to fall back in again; things just seem to have changed too much. My relationship with Europe runs along similar, if less romantic, lines. I have run several firms, done a great deal of business in Europe, my family live in France, and I am an internationalist at heart. In this context, the prospect of the EU referendum made me slightly uneasy – in terms of the general fear of dramatic change, being seen to be too “little Britain”, and the effect it would have on growth. I was pretty clear that I would vote to stay in – regardless of the outcome of any negotiation. But then I started to look more closely at the facts. Aside from being the chief executive of Somerset Capital, I also chair the New City Initiative (NCI), a trade group of boutique fund managers. Our purpose is to promulgate a vision of better alignment of interest between investor and fund or wealth manager through the culture of partnership, co-investment and specialisation. The project we undertook was to analyse how the “free market” of Europe was working for our industry and what we might suggest could be included in a UK negotiation, in relation to the asset and wealth management industry. We were amazed to discover that there is no “free market” for financial services. We found that if you wanted to sell a mutual fund (OEIC) in all 27 member states, it would cost €1.5m (£1.1m) in registration fees to do so (this is in addition to the original set-up costs), and then around €1m a year simply to maintain the relevant documentation. These astonishing costs were further augmented by the one-year average time for full registrations in some countries. There were also additional, surreptitious hurdles placed in the way of free trade in countries such as Germany that insist upon specific tax reporting, or even some of the eastern members where additional depositories are required for no known reason. ‘Imagine what life would be like, if the EU actually worked. The marketplace we would create would be the largest on earth’ Tellingly, when confronted with these issues, EU officials reacted with amazement, saying that any country blocking free movement of capital was acting wrongly – before expressing a high degree of powerlessness to do anything about it. One eurocrat I encountered replied “Why bother?” when told how difficult it was to register in Slovenia – where the local banks are not properly established to comply with the set-up requirements that the local authorities insist upon. Look by contrast at the US’s Securities and Exchange Commission. It is a large and complex organisation whose requirements are substantial and all good asset managers work hard to maintain the right standards. The key is that once you are through the process you have a vast, free and open market in which to trade. The potential of that huge open market makes it worth the cost and time. In Europe, however, the NCI’s research discovered this was not the case at all in financial services. If the UK left the EU (assuming trade treaties and other issues can still be negotiated), I do not believe that it would make any difference at all to the ease – or difficulty – of trade for our industry in the EU. Indeed, the fact that London has to suffer under the weight of such EU regulation is currently a deterrent for international boutiques locating here. If we leave, we may even get richer and our human capital more plentiful. If Europe is to work, it has to promote capital flows, savings and quality investing. Of all things that should flow, money has to be the first, and if we are to retire with any form of dignity we also need to encourage specialist financial services. Smaller firms in this area often deliver better returns due to their flexibility (versus the larger fund managers) and I certainly believe that a boutique, owned by its staff and invested alongside its clients, is a better structure for reducing risk, specifically and systemically, than a global bank. Would Britain thrive outside the EU? Unfortunately, the regulators in Europe take the opposite approach, wanting to push the market into – we have been told anecdotally – “four or five” providers of savings products. While easy to regulate, it would in fact be devilishly dangerous to the system at large and hardly right for delivering strong, sustainable returns and staying close to customers. Now, rather like a couple in counselling, I am willing to try again and I do still have hope in the project that is Europe. In our paper Asset management in Europe: the case for reform, we suggested several ways in which we could rectify the situation. First, make the EU a free market by stripping down countries’ pernicious barriers and enforce the rules equally. Second, we would push for an opt-out from EU rules for firms in London who do not sell into any other EU country.

Fourth, we would raise the hurdle at which smaller firms become subject to the same onerous regulatory framework as a transnational behemoth. As a businessman wanting to grow my company in the European Union, I want my country to be able to participate in this market and for the market itself to be free and open. Currently, we suffer the estimated €2bn annual costs of European regulations and the substantial costs of marketing in each country, and yet have no real benefits. We don’t believe the regulators make us safer, we actually feel they diminish returns and push us towards greater systemic risk. It’s time Britain pushed not just for reforms in terms of our own interest, but also to make Europe work for its own sake; to get money flowing around this vast potential financial services market. Imagine what life would be like if the EU actually worked. The marketplace we would create would be the largest on earth, the regulatory burden would be focused on competition, rather than strangulation – and the citizens of Europe (including, yes, the British) would all benefit from better returns and reduced risk. However, without a proper shake-up, it is getting harder for even European romantics like me to stay committed to this special relationship.
