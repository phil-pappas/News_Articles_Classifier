LED lighting, motion sensors and timers, as well as a shut-down computer policy for back of house offices, saves electricity usage.

And water filtered from the swimming pool is reused in the whirlpool and plunge pool. \nAll waste is separated including glass and plastic, organic waste, oil and fats as well as cartridges and batteries. These materials are either recycled or reused in accordance with Hotels Van Oranje’s optimal waste management system. In addition, biodegradable cleaners are also deployed at the hotel. \nThe hotel’s kitchens prefer organic products and fair-trade coffee and tea, and sustainable local suppliers are used as much as possible to reduce the property’s impact on the environment and limit the use of fossil fuels. Furthermore, local suppliers who are open to becoming sustainable businesses can do so in collaboration with the Hotels Van Oranje. \nIn line with their social responsibilities, the hotel supports at least four projects per year through sponsorship or providing a location for fundraising events. The hotel sponsors numerous events including The Orange Babies Gala, which raises funds for various projects in Africa to assist pregnant women infected with HIV. Similarly The Muscles for Muscles Gala was held to raise money to support children with muscle disease. Closer to home, the hotel supports the VV Noordwijk football gala, where money is collected through an auction for athletic and personal development of young Dutch players. The Hotels Van Oranje also sponsors various museums and local organizations. Research foundations such as the KWF Cancer, AIDS foundation fund, foundation KiKa and union HIV are also supported by the hotel. \nView the Green Globe video interview with Jaap Liethof, Managing Director of Hotels Van Oranje here. \nAbout Hotels Van Oranje \nIn 2012 Hotels Van Oranje created its first Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Policy in order to anchor sustainability in the business.
