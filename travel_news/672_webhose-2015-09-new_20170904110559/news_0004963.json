The event highlighted Her Majesty Queen Sirikit’s Thai silk initiative with the mission to preserve and nurture Thai woven fabrics as one of the country’s cultural treasures and in essence to promote beautiful Thai silk worldwide.\nFor this project, Her Majesty the Queen chose the “Peacock” as the emblem to represent the great quality of Thai silk as the natural beauty of the peacock’s feathers is often time mirrored through the intricate design of Thai silk. Her Majesty the Queen requested permission to use a then-vacant building on the grounds of the Grand Palace to house a museum of textiles with the museum’s main missions to preserve traditional textiles and hold exhibitions featuring valuable textiles of the royal court and those created by rural villagers.\nMrs. Kulpramote Wannalert, Director of the TAT Los Angeles Office said, “The Threads of Thailand celebrity event featured different elements of Thainess, such as, Thai classical music and dance, Thai arts and crafts, Thai massage and Thai cuisine demonstration by Chef Vanda, Ayara Thai Cuisine.”\nThreads of Thailand 02_500x300 Mrs. Kulpramote Wannalert presents a bouquet of flowers to Elisabeth Rohm.\nThe event also featured a fashion show of Thai silk costumes from the LA-based Thai designer, Aksarapak (Yaya) Bondu, who also designed Elisabeth Rohm’s elegant gold Thai dress that she wore to this event.\nIn addition, TAT was honoured to have Dr. Sumet Tantivejkul, Secretary General of the Chaipattana Foundation, who spoke about the significant roles of the King of Thailand and the Royal Family in preserving and promoting Thai silk around the world.\nSource:- Tourism Authority of Thailand", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T14:58:02.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
