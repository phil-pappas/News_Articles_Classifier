The survey explores travelers’ habits when planning and booking their trips, as well as their attitudes towards visiting less commonly-visited areas such as city suburbs, and smaller towns during their vacation. \nAvailable in five languages, the 10-minute survey is open to citizens aged 16-35 of the following countries/territories: Australia, China, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Macau SAR, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Participants will also have the option to take part in a lucky draw to win an Apple Watch. \nResults from the survey will help drive the analysis of PATA’s second study on the travel trends of young Asian consumers, titled 'Stepping Out of the Crowd'. Sponsored by PATA Premier Partner Visa Worldwide Pte Ltd, the study is set to discuss how and where young Asian travellers are going ‘off the beaten track’, while presenting practical advice on how destinations can manage future tourism growth responsibly. The study is a follow-up to PATA’s first report on Millennial travel trends, ‘The Rise of the Young Asian Traveller’, released in August 2015, with the aim of helping PATA members worldwide to understand the implications of future outbound tourism growth from Asia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T19:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T18:49:14.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
