First relax in luxury on the Rocky Mountaineer train as it forges its way past foaming torrents and primeval forests. Then visit turquoise lakes and crisp glaciers as you thread your way by road between snow-white peaks, before embarking on a seven-night Holland America Line cruise through amazing scenery where whales roam and glaciers calve. The Rockies Explorer and Alaska Cruise is APT’s most popular tour in North America. You’ll travel in Rocky Mountaineer’s premier GoldLeaf service and stay in five-star Fairmont hotels with amazing views. During your Alaska cruise your stateroom will have a private veranda for viewing the fantastic scenery. You will be escorted by a tour director and expert local guides throughout and there will be no more than 40 people in your tour group. Everything is included, from air fares and tips to a menu of Freedom of Choice dining and sightseeing options that will help make the tour a uniquely personal odyssey at no extra cost. The Inside Passage is one of the world’s most scenic sea lanes. You may spot whales, sea lions and porpoises In Banff at the heart of the Rockies, for example, you could opt to soar like an eagle on a helicopter flight or relax in a spa with vistas of mountains and lakes. And in Victoria on Vancouver Island you could take a whale-watching expedition or a horse-drawn carriage tour. The icing on the cake is a series of APT’s outstanding Signature Invitations – tailor-made excursions to help you capture the culture, lifestyle or cuisine of a destination. Ever wanted to know how the Mounties “always get their man”? Or what it’s like to watch for grizzly bears in their native habitat? With APT’s Signature Invitations you’ll find out. Your holiday begins with a flight to Vancouver, a city that epitomises many of the delights you’ll experience on the trip – mountains, glittering water, verdant parks and eclectic cuisine. Enjoy a guided tour to admire the totem poles of Stanley Park, Granville Island and picturesque English Bay. Then embark on one of the world’s greatest rail journeys aboard the blue and gold-liveried Rocky Mountaineer. APT has ensured you’ll have the best of everything as a guest in the train’s elite GoldLeaf carriage. The upper deck of each luxurious, split-level carriage has a glass-domed roof so you won’t miss a single snow-capped peak. Precious moments: experience the luxury of the GoldLeaf Carriage Meanwhile the train’s top-class chefs are transforming amazing local produce into à la carte breakfasts and three-course gourmet lunches. Rocky Mountaineer travels only in daylight so you should miss none of the stunning landscapes between Vancouver and Banff during the two-day trip. Highlights include the thundering waters of Hell’s Gate in Fraser Canyon, the Spiral Tunnels and crossing the Continental Divide at Kicking Horse Pass. In Banff you’ll spend two nights in a mountain-view room at The Fairmont Banff Springs, more fairy-tale castle than hotel. Here you can explore the Bow River by boat or canoe, or visit the Cave and Basin National Historic Site, followed by a Freedom of Choice dining selection including Italian, Bavarian and American restaurants, at no extra cost. Next morning, APT has exclusively arranged for you to meet a Mountie and get the inside track on the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, before beginning your drive through the majestic Banff and Jasper National Parks. Known as the “Jewel of the Rockies”, Lake Louise is one of the most photogenic lakes in the western hemisphere. See for yourself from your Lakeview room at The Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise. Here an expert guide will explain the region’s natural history, followed by another Freedom of Choice dining experience. Hidden beauty: the Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise A leisurely, three-day journey by luxury coach gives ample opportunity to admire ancient ice-fields, forested valleys and pristine lakes, including mighty Athabasca Falls and Mount Robson, the Canadian Rockies’ loftiest peak. Overnight stops include a third Fairmont property, the Jasper Park Lodge, and APT has arranged another Signature Invitation, a boat safari on the Monashee Mountains’ Blue River in search of bears and eagles. Almost everything on this luxury tour is included in the price, but for the crossing to Vancouver Island there’s just one optional extra that you may not want to miss: a one-hour floatplane flight with incredible views. You’ll stay two nights in Victoria, British Columbia’s trim-and-tidy capital. APT has arranged a special early morning visit to the city’s popular Butchart Gardens, followed by breakfast in the Butcharts’ original family home. That leaves time for another Freedom of Choice option – a seaplane flight, salmon fishing, or afternoon tea at The Fairmont Empress Hotel. For the final week of your epic tour you’ll join a Holland America Line ship for a seven-night voyage along Alaska’s Inside Passage, accompanied by an APT escort. Once again APT has added extra touches, including complimentary beer and wine with each dinner and a Sail Away feast in the Pinnacle Grill, famed for its steaks and seafood. Chill out zone: marvel at the pristine beauty of Glacier Bay The Inside Passage is one of the world’s most scenic sea lanes and ships can sail incredibly close to shore. You may spot whales, sea lions and porpoises. Reaching World Heritage-listed Glacier Bay, at least 50 glaciers meet the sea here and several regularly “calve” new icebergs into the blue water. Three shore visits afford unique insights into the customs and culture of the resilient Alaskans. Juneau is the only US state capital inaccessible by road and the historic centre of Skagway – once a gateway to the Klondike Gold Rush – has been exquisitely restored. Charming Ketchikan is famed for its totem poles and colourful wooden houses on stilts. It’s a great place to buy hand-carved items to mark an amazing holiday before cruising back along the beautiful Inside Passage.
