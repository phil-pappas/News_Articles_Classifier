They also excluded those who never smoked, as the goal was to evaluate influences on quitting rather than starting smoking.\n“We assume that people begin smoking for reasons other than wages,” said Leigh.\n“About 90 per cent of smokers in the US started smoking before age 20, so the data captured a sample of most full-time workers who have ever smoked,” he said.\nChanges in the “treatment,” which in this case was wages, were measured for each year and then compared to smoking rates in the subsequent year, revealing the role of wage increases on reducing smoking among men and the less educated.\nSmoking prevalence was lower overall in states with higher minimum wages, researchers said.\nThey also found that smoking rates for women were not influenced by wages, and that smoking rates for men were not influenced by additional household income.\nThey speculate that men may be more apt to tie self-worth to pay, increasing the likelihood of risky health behaviours among men in lower-paying jobs.\n“Our findings add to the existing body of epidemiological literature showing that lower income predicts poor health habits. They also show that higher minimum wages could reduce the prevalence of smoking,” Leigh said.\nThe study was published in the journal Annals of Epidemiology.\nFirst Published on September 01, 2015 4:48 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T16:22:08.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
