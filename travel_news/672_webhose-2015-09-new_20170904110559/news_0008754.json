If the great beasts are gone, man will surely die of a great loneliness of spirit.” -Chief Seattle of the Nez Perce, 1884 \n\"You see, the lantana bushes destroy the forest, that's why, every so often they need to be cut down.\" Our forest guide, Negi, was at his awesome best, describing in detail the flora and fauna inside Corbett National Park in India. A few months earlier, my friend was fascinated watching an elephant amble across the crowded streets of Mumbai. Six months later, we were inside a wildlife park in North India, on the lookout for elephants in the wilderness of untamed forests. \nLying cozily and snug in the foothills of the Himalayas and named after the famous author and hunter turned conservationist, Jim Corbett, this wildlife park is one of the finest habitats of the Asian elephant and tiger, besides having an impressive variety of flora, that includes elephant grass, sal, khair (Acacia catechu), tendu (Diospyros tomentosa), cannabis, and sain (Terminalia tomentosa). Over 100 species of trees, 60 species of shrubs, 2 species of bamboos, and over 30 species of climbers crowd the 520 sq. km. tract of forest with the winding Ramganga River playing the role of a faithful companion. \nIt was early afternoon, the forest silent as we drove on unpaved roads in an open air jeep, the wind gently brushing past our faces. All around, the forest began to unfold; here, a dense overgrowth of shrubs; there, a crowd of sal and bamboo; in the distance; elephant grass; while on the horizon it was irregularly-shaped mountain peaks reaching for the skies. The fresh forest and mountain air was beginning to intoxicate our senses. \nI began asking Negi strange questions. \"Do elephants talk?\" Negi wasn't amused. Being specifically trained for his job, which is more of a rarity than a regularity in many wildlife parks, Negi proved to be an exception and stood out, like his pencil-thin moustache and his light eyes. \"Elephants are known to communicate among herds for distances in the range of 20 kilometers using low-frequency calls that cannot be picked by the human ear,\" he replied. \"Besides, elephants have immense intelligence and never forget until they die.\" A bit like humans, I thought. \"Unlike other animals, the brains expand during their lifetime, thereby giving them a natural ability to learn, all the time.\" A bit unlike humans, I wearily concluded! \nNegi's commentary was interrupted as we spotted the remains of a barking deer. Negi closely examined the pugmarks and concluded that it belonged to a tigress. Somewhere in the distance she would be having her afternoon siesta, lying either in the rocky ravines or hidden in elephant grass. With 80 tigers roaming inside this wildlife park, the chances of tracking rests at about 10%. There is a greater chance of being spotted than spotting one! We moved on, as Negi was more intent on speaking about elephants. The dense forest growth soon gave way to an open grassland, while the river snaked its way through the plains. We spotted a lone tusker, quite unusual among elephants, as it's common for them to move in herds. Negi explained that periodically elephants suffered from a perplexing condition called “musth,” something which was associated with sexual maturity and desire and resulted in imbalanced mood behavior. During this period, they excrete a sticky substance from their temporal glands and are best left alone. From a distance, the tusker looked in perfect composure. On closer inspection, he would be competing for Mr. Imperfect. We moved along. \n\"How do locals respond to wildlife conservation and poaching?\" Negi replied, \"The locals that live on the periphery of the forest are being asked to make contributions to wildlife preservation by becoming guides, more tourist friendly and discouraging attempts at poaching by turning down offers of killing wildlife, since it's the locals who possess immense knowledge about the forests and not the poachers, who generally provide only ammunition and money.\" \nSambhar gamboled in the running waters, oblivious of the dangers of the wild cats, while high above on a solitary branch, the crested serpent eagle surveyed the earth below for unsuspecting prey. The solitary king vulture glided in open skies; at eye level, robins, bulbuls, drongos, woodpeckers, and flycatchers could be heard and spotted along. With over 500 species of birds, we couldn't be grudged for sighting at least 100, although we hadn't yet managed to spot an elephant herd. The shadows began to lengthen with the sun commencing its downward descent, casting a slanting orange glow and painting the forest, now awash with colors of crimson and gold. Negi continued his tidbits, like the one about elephants loving salt, to the number of toes on its front and hind feet. \nMy mind raced back to the earlier occasions when I had spotted elephants in the wild at Madhumalai, Bandipur, and Nagorhole National Parks in South India; herds that strode along crushing obstacles that came along their path. We watched from a distance in wonder and regaled at the marvels of nature. Then there were the harvest festivals I had attended at the City Palace in Mysore, where on an auspicious day, a huge procession of caparisoned elephants bedecked in jewelry and color made their way past palace gates to a grand stadium. This spectacle lasted for a few hours but left timeless memories. \nLight began to fade, the same could be said about the color on our faces. We craned our necks in all directions, looking for the elusive pachyderms. Negi had fallen silent, in fact the entire forest seemed to have retreated as well. All of a sudden, over a distance of over a kilometer, I noticed some movement. Against the backdrop of the dark impenetrable forest, it was impossible to tell. We stood and stared for what seemed like an eternity, before we decided, yes, those were indeed elephants. One couldn't mistake the slow deliberate movement of the group with different shapes and sizes, bodies donned the color of mud, instead of the customary black we are so used to seeing. We sped along. \nMinutes later we found ourselves face to face with the herd, a large matriarchal group of about twenty, with the oldest well in its sixties, while the youngest was probably a year old, constantly getting lost among the pillar of legs, trunks, and tusks. They foraged on grass and leaves, twigs and branches, and continued the procession, unmindful of our presence. \nLed by a female in front and tuskers at the rear end, the group moved in twos and threes swaying and occasionally colliding with each other. We stared like curious schoolchildren on an outdoor picnic, vaguely trying to reconstruct the story of the elephant and 6 blind men. “Should an elephant attack you, spit at the end of his trunk,” someone once said. Leave alone spitting, I wondered whether I'd be able to open my mouth. Sure-footed, the group began its retreat from the open grassland into the safe confines of the forest, from where we heard twigs being crushed and branches being broken, the occasional trumpet and swishing of trunks. It meant curtains for us as well, the “drama” of the pachyderms having lasted for a good wholesome ten minutes. \nThe species “elephas maximus” and me - what's the common thread that brings us together? They, always showing up like duty-bound postmen, and me behaving like a lover on his first unconfirmed date! Am I part of the herd as well? Search me. Perhaps Negi has an answer. \nThe author, Hector Dsouza, is President and Proprietor of Lorient Travels in Mumbai, India.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T01:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T02:21:00.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
