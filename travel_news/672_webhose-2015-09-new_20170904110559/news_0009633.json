This has already tainted the organisation’s name, especially the Bali Provincial Police,” General Nyoman said. \nWhen asked if the extortion had happened General Nyoman replied: “Correct”. \nHe confirmed that admissions had been made but the sum of $25,000 had not been admitted. \n“Only lots of (money) bills. What’s clear, they have violated the ethical code. It’s unjustified.” General Nyoman said an internal affairs trial date would be set. The heaviest penalty for violation of the professional ethics code was expulsion from the force and the lightest penalty was an apology, he said. \nKuta’s police chief, Ida Bagus Dedy Januarta, on Monday denied the Australian claims and showed reporters a letter he said was signed by all the men saying they didn’t have to pay for their release from police custody. \nGeneral Nyoman said on Tuesday that Ida was only a witness in the investigation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T04:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T05:22:31.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
