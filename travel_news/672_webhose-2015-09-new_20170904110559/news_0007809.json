Photograph by: Courtesy , Hong Kong Tourism Board \nHONG KONG — A group of thugs bursts into an unassuming restaurant and the diners barely look up while gossiping over their noodle dishes. \nPatrons of this local institution, the Mido Cafe, continue eating unfazed as the ruffians turn over tables and break a glass door. It’s probably just another action movie being shot in the second-floor restaurant on Temple Street in Kowloon. \nBut this time it turns out the thugs were real. \nThe 2013 incident is just one of the colourful tales of Kowloon that our guide, Paul Chan, recounts as we enjoy a slice of local comfort food — peanut butter and condensed milk on toast — in this popular 1950s-era diner that was a favourite shooting haunt for action movie directors. \nWe’re on the Good Evening Kowloon night tour in the Yau Ma Tei section of Kowloon, a peninsula that makes up one of the three districts of Hong Kong. \nNight markets \nKowloon has a fascinating gritty side, more than enough to fill an evening. It seems worlds away from posh shops such as Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Le Mer and Coach that are scattered about the city in more than a dozen mega malls or street-front shops. \nBy night, market vendors set up tables crammed with everything from Hello Kitty kitsch to knock-off designer purses at the Temple Street Night Market . It’s a great spot to buy souvenirs for friends and family. \nA few blocks away, the organic smell of produce wafts in the air from another type of market entirely — the wholesale fruit market. \nA naive passerby in the 1970s might not have known what was really happening within the ramshackle warren of stalls. Amid the melons and oranges was a thriving — and illicit — heroin trade that nearly took down an entire police department because they’d turned a blind eye to the crime. Chan tells us the police of the day received bribes and favours of all kinds. \nBut the nightlife isn’t all cops and robbers tales. \nSingalong singing parlours \nOur tour includes some things we might never have done on our own. The most entertaining is the chance to watch the raw talent at the Happy Day singing parlour on Temple Street. Back home, we’d call them karaoke bars, but at this establishment — packed on a Monday night — it feels like we’re hanging out in someone’s 1970s basement. \nChristmas lights adorn the walls and peanut shells litter the floor. A stack of binders filled with sheet music of popular Cantonese music is piled near the front door. \nThe regulars, singing Cantonese folk songs from decades past as patrons nurse their Blue Girl beer, are why the place is packed. Mr. Lam, the owner of the establishment, is the keyboard player in the band. The loyal crowd makes frequent requests and stuffs a bowl on the stage with generous tips. \n“You either love it or hate it,” our guide Chan says. For me, it was a slice of local culture I wouldn’t want to have missed. \nNor did I want to pass up having my fortune read on Temple Street. Our soothsayer keeps several finches on his table and Snowy the bird randomly selects my tarot cards, which portend that my life will be smooth sailing and prosperous. I will continue to travel the world — and return to Hong Kong one day, my kind clairvoyant tells me. \nThat’s a prediction I’m already looking forward to. \nPracticalities \nBackground: Check out the excellent Hong Kong Tourism Board website’s FAQ page for complete information on everything from Hong Kong weather to dining. \nShopping:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T01:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T16:46:56.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
