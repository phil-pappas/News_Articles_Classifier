Budget airlines like to warn passengers that the gate closes half-an-hour before departure. As you may have discovered, though, the reality is that boarding rarely starts until 20 minutes ahead. Yet as I approach Gate 40, expecting to find one hundred-plus people milling about, the screen is warning \"inal Call\" (the 'F' has dropped off due to a screen malfunction). I am about to be the last person to board. Evidently, we will be getting the F out of here ahead of schedule.\nThat's because Ryanair flight FR8555 to Castellón, a small city on the Mediterranean coast between Valencia and Barcelona, is not an everyday event.\n\"An extra special welcome on board the very first flight to Castellón,\" announces Captain Dan Foster. And when he says \"first,\" he means it. This isn't just Ryanair's maiden departure to the airport officially known as Castellón-Costa Azahar, which serves Spain's \"orange blossom coast\". It is the first-ever commercial flight to an airport that has become a symbol of grandiose public projects by a nation on the edge of economic meltdown.\nTo keep their airline in financial good health, the cabin crew make a sales pitch for scratch cards: \"Check your pockets to see if you have any spare change,\" they advise. \"If you don't have any then check the pockets of the passenger next to you.\"\nThe passenger next to me on this historic flight is Carol Dodd from Bromley. She and her husband, John, own a property in Alcossebre, a resort on the coast 20 minutes away from the airport.\n\"There was talk of an airport in 2003, then a few years later they started building it,\" says Carol. \"We're thrilled to have it on our doorstep.\"\nIt will be tricky for her to thank personally the man responsible, Carlos Fabra, because the 70-year-old politician is in prison for corruption. Before he was sentenced, he officially opened the €150m airport in 2011. But my definition of an airport that is open involves one with flights landing and taking off, passengers passing through, with relatives, lovers and taxi drivers there to welcome them or wave goodbye – that sort of thing. While the airport code for Castellón de Plana is CDT, it really should be ZMB, as in \"zombie\". The plane is set to arrive 10 minutes early – and four years late.\nWhy has Castellón proved so unpopular? One reason lies 50 miles south-west: Valencia's thriving airport. A bigger rival stands to the north-east; travellers with global ambitions can use Barcelona, with flights as far afield as Beijing and Buenos Aires. Successful airports are all about scale. The more flights they have, the more attractive they are to airlines – and passengers, who appreciate a wide choice of destinations and departure times. It's a kind of gravity, which is gently drawing the Boeing 737 back to the earth's surface.\nThe final approach makes clear the appeal to the traveller of this neglected swathe of Spain. There are no air-traffic delays, on account of there being no air traffic except us. We fly over the eroded remains of ancient volcanoes, then gentler hills dressed in evergreens and carved by streams. Through the haze the Mediterranean emerges, its lacy shore traced by a ripple of gentle surf.\nA ripple of applause rewards Captain Foster's perfect touchdown. He steers us towards an impressive terminal building which looks as though it opened this week rather than before the London Olympics. Spain may have an embarrassing surplus of airports, but they look great. Facing the coastal range, Castellón comprises an elegant white slab whose edges are softened by curves.\nWelcome wash: the first plane to arrive at Castellón (EPA) The most underemployed fire truck in Spain sprays an arch of water over the new plane, and about 50 high-visibility journalists and photographers wear their safety jackets on a makeshift grandstand. Castellón is seen by many as a shiny symptom of misplaced political ambition – and the BBC's Daily Politics has even sent a team to meet the flight. They have to elbow their way through the crowds to get a good position in the arrivals area, because there seems to be one meeter and greeter for each of the 180 passengers.\nHow best to sum up the demographic on the flight? Well it was the first time I have ever been greeted from a flight by a carpenter. Angel Vergara, who also does metalwork and has a sideline in mosquito screens, was busily seeking to drum up business from returning British expatriates – many thousands of whom reside on the Costa Azahar. Which is where I am going now.\nAn airport, however stylish, is just a means to an end. And the purpose of my journey is to test how Castellón airport can benefit the British traveller. I am in danger of being the only passenger on the bus from the airport, until I recruit Mairi and Mahmood Hossain – retired medics from south London who are on their own journey of discovery. Our destination is the gem of the Costa Azahar: not the small industrial city of Castellón, but a resort whose name looks, to English eyes, like a new and rather rude soft drink: Peñíscola.\nThe old town of Penyiscola, as it is approximately pronounced, crowds prettily around an outcrop topped by a fortress. It is the work of the Knights Templar – crusaders who, after retreating from the Holy Land, settled here and threw their considerable weight and resources into building a castle that could command a swathe of the Mediterranean. Rising from the raw rock, its honey-coloured stones radiate domination. But hardly had they completed the work in 1307 when their order was ordered out by Jaume II of Aragon. Redundant buildings have quite a tradition in these parts.\nThe next notable resident was the Pope. Or was he an Anti-Pope? In the late 14th century, as the Catholic church tore itself apart between Avignon and Rome, a Spaniard named Pedro de Luna, better known around these parts as Papa Luna, was elected Pope of the Avignon papacy, and took the name Benedict XIII. Slowly support for him ebbed, leaving Scotland among his few friends; he granted permission for a university at St Andrews. Papa Luna lived out his last few years in the castle of Peñíscola, in a room with a view over the unholy sea which he may have called the Costa del Schism. A grumpy-looking statue of him greets visitors to the castle. But clambering through, up and over the fortress is a joyful experience – culminating in what could be the best viewing platform in the Mediterranean. From the papal perch you win a prize panorama comprising the harbour, the mountains marching off into the haze and the enticing curve of the beach.\nBecause of the look of the thrust of rock jutting out from the shore, Peñíscola is sometimes described as the Gibraltar of Valencia Province. But it has nothing like the scale of the Rock, and neither is it in the hands of the British – yet. But the new flights from Stansted and Bristol will bring around a thousand people a week from the UK, and the shrewd arrivals will make for Peñíscola.\nFor a place to stay, the Muva is a boutique beauty, treading on the skirts of the fortress as it leans across towards the harbour. And along Avenida Papa Luna – the boulevard that bowls along the shore from the harbour – you find plenty of mid-rise, mid-century hotels, some with Art Deco flourishes.\nBundle in the dunes that cushion the beach from the road, plus a handy jogging and cycling track, and you have a cut-price Miami Beach.\nCastellón is a cut-price gateway to Spain: on any date in November, a return flight from Stansted is currently £36. Ryanair in enjoying some incentives to put the moribund airport on the map, but unless fares rise heaven knows if Europe's biggest budget airline will still be there a year from now. For the meantime, each landing is a miracle.\nPeñíscola's main fiesta concludes this weekend. The carnival may almost be over, yet for a lost corner of Spain the celebrations are only beginning.\nGetting there \nYou can fly to Castellón from Stansted or Bristol on Ryanair (0871 246 0000; ryanair.com). Simon Calder booked early and paid £34 one way. If you choose an open-jaw itinerary, then the main departure point is Barcelona airport – with a wide range of links to airports across the UK.\nAutos Mediterráneo operates buses from Castellón airport to Peñíscola – both the town centre and many of the big hotels. The one-way fare is €13, and the journey takes no more than an hour.\nMore information \nCastellón airport has a very helpful tourist office, which also sells bus tickets. In Peñíscola, the tourist office is beside the beach (00 34 964 480 208; peniscola.org).\nIf you happen to need some carpentry, or a mosquito screen in the area, contact Angel Vergara (00 34 964 371 015; arvcarpinteria.com).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T15:07:33.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
