There are 22 new ships that will be introduced globally in 2015 and whether its new builds, or revitalizations, the industry continues to deliver “firsts” in ship construction, design and onboard amenities and facilities. Additionally, consumers are in control more than ever in their travel and cruise experiences. Cruise lines are developing new itineraries based on niche interests to meet the demands of travelers wanting more thrills and specific experiences from their vacations like cruises with specific themes or food focuses.\nTravel And Tour World: What are the latest trends in the industry that you find it most interesting?\nCindy D’Aoust: A couple of things come to mind:\nIncrease in Meetings and Events at Sea – Having just come from a meeting professional organization, I understand the challenges planners have in delivering memorable and engaging events within their budgets. New ship designs coupled with enhanced entertainment and onboard activities make cruising an even greater asset in the meeting planner toolbox. CLIA has just partnered with MPI to develop the “Meetings and Events at Sea” a certificate program, a half day course that helps meeting planners understand the value they can deliver to their clients through cruising.\nExpanded Role of the Travel Agent – The role of a travel agent is always evolving. Today, successful agents are trusted travel consultants who have an in-depth knowledge of destinations, ship design and itineraries and are able to match the right ship and activities to the customer. Additionally, as many are independent agents, they are developing marketing skills and learning how to leverage social media to build their business. Our role here at CLIA is to work with our agency and agent members to provide relevant professional development content and to create in-person engagement opportunities with ports, destinations and other partners to help the travel professionals be successful.\nThere’s more information from Cindy D’Aoust when Travel And Tour World questions her the following:-\n1.
