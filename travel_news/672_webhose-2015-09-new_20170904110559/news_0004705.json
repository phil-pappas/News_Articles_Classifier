Nestled in the scenic Western Ghats, the resort is a few hours’ drive from the cosmopolitan centers of Mumbai and Pune, and offers guests an ideal getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city.\n“Le Méridien and India share a passion for culture, the arts and cuisine,” said Brian Povinelli, Global Brand Leader, Le Méridien and Westin. “As our first Le Méridien resort in India, we look forward to inviting our creative and curious minded travelers to unlock the destination through our locally-inspired programming, culinary creations and of course, relaxation.”\nLe Méridien Mahabaleshwar Resort & Spa features 122 stylishly appointed guestrooms and suites, all complemented with private balconies that offer expansive views of the surrounding natural scenery. Each room features the brand’s signature amenities and destination-inspired moments of discovery. The brand’s reinterpretation of the traditional lobby, the signature Le Méridien Hub, transforms the public space into a social gathering place. Guests are greeted by a 24-hour curated soundtrack by French Bossa Nova band Nouvelle Vague, exclusive illy coffee prepared by Master Baristas, and Sparkling cocktails, inspired by Europe’s aperitif hour.\nFor culinary experiences, guests can indulge in the resort’s destination restaurants and bars. Latest Recipe, the interactive all day dining restaurant, features an evocative mix of international, Asian and local cuisine. Chingari, the Indian specialty restaurant, offers some of the most diverse flavours and fiery preparations of Northern India. The pool-side restaurant, Plunge Bar, allows guests to savour canapés and sublime blends and spirits, while Longitude 73 transforms from a casual coffee house by day to a vibrant social scene in the evening.\n“We are pleased to unveil the spectacular Le Méridien Mahabaleshwar Resort & Spa, a highly anticipated addition to our India portfolio”, said Dilip Puri, Managing Director India and Regional Vice President South Asia, Starwood Hotels & Resorts. “With its culturally-refined design and atmosphere combined with stunning views, the resort is sure to impress and attract travelers for a refreshing break, and emerge as a leading resort in the country.”\nOwned by BrahmaCorp, the resort endorses Starwood’s growing partnership with the hospitality company. “With the opening of Le Méridien Mahabaleshwar Resort & Spa, we have further strengthened our partnership with Starwood Hotels & Resorts, the world’s leading hotel company,” said Ajay Agrawal, Managing Director of BrahmaCorp.\nOther resort facilities include the Explore Spa by Le Méridien with eight treatment rooms including a hammam bath treatment room and a vichy shower treatment room. The well-equipped fitness centre along with both a lagoon style swimming pool and a rooftop infinity pool make for the ideal rejuvenating experience. The resort also offers 250 square metres of banqueting space including a ballroom, four versatile meeting rooms and a well-appointed business centre. The serene outdoor venues provide for inspiring spaces for meetings and events.\nAdditionally, Le Méridien Mahabaleshwar offers Le Méridien Family Kids Club with programming that allows families to play and strengthen their bonds during their vacation. As part of the brand’s global partnership with LEGO, children up to the age of 12 will also receive a complimentary LEGO Welcome Amenity to enjoy during their stay and take home as a keepsake from their travels.\nThe resort provides seamless access to the quaint hill town’s rich tapestry of offerings, including a curated visit, courtesy of the brand’s UNLOCK ART programme, to the Devrai Art Village and the 5,000 year old Krishna Devi temple, using only the room’s key card for access.
