And although Birkenstocks are more the norm than Manolo Blahniks, this cosmopolitan city also has upscale shopping, fabulous restaurants and a happening nightlife. Kevin Schafer/Photodisc/Getty Images Location \nVancouver is on the south west coast of British Columbia, Canada's most westerly province. It is about a 3 hr drive from Seattle Washington. \nThe City of Vancouver is one of more than 20 municipalities that makes up Greater Vancouver and sits on the edge of the Strait of Georgia, which separates it from Vancouver Island - home to the provincial capital of Victoria. \nVancouver's location is beautiful as it is surrounded by water and tucked into the slopes of the BC Coast Mountain Range. Vancouver Weather & Climate Vancouver is the Canadian city with the best climate and the worst weather according to writer Allan Fotheringham. Vancouver is infamous for the amount of rain it receives; however, the weather is mild year-round. From high 70's Fahrenheit (low 20's Celsius) in summer to mid 40's Fahrenheit (0° to 5° Celsius) in winter, the climate is seldom unpleasant. Winters are wet, but snow is rare, except on local ski hills.
