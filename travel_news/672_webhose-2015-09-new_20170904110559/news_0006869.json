Organisations are invited and encouraged to share their knowledge. \n“For too long the travel and tourism industry has been focusing on crisis communications and how to respond to a disaster, however it is now vital for all organisations to place their attention on tourism resilience and preparedness. It is time now for destinations to be proactive, rather than reactive,” said PATA CEO Mario Hardy. “Severe disasters can have an immense impact not only the lives of the people affected but also on tourism and employment in the long term. The industry needs to play an important role in encouraging disaster risk management at all levels.” \nThe addition of tourism resilience content on the PATA sustainability website will be a useful, accessible, and powerful platform to provide the right tools for tourism organisations to mitigate and handle risk. With additional content, PATA hopes to address crisis operations and communications issues, safety and security issues, as well as provide additional knowledge through case studies and academic papers. \nThrough knowledge sharing, the Association hopes to further connect sustainability-minded organisations and provide support in developing sustainable, socially responsible, and risk resilient business practices. PATA’s vision is for the website is to be a “one-stop-shop” for all information related to sustainable and socially responsible tourism. \nMaterials submitted are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution – NonCommercial 4.0 International License.
