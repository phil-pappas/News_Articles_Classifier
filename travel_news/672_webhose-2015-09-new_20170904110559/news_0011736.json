Meet the animals in Animal Kingdom Go wild on a Kilimanjaro Safari at Animal Kingdom in Walt Disney World . Climb into an open-air safari vehicle for a thrilling expedition into the 110-acre Harambe Wildlife Reserve, just like the African bush. Here, you can spot everything from cheetahs and magnificent lions to elephants, flamingos, hippopotami and giraffes. 2. Watch the fireworks in Magic Kingdom Be enchanted by Magic Kingdom’s fireworks and lights spectacular, Wishes – The Show features the voices of beloved characters including Jiminy Cricket and the Blue Fairy, Disney songs to sing along to, and stunning special effects as Cinderella’s Castle turns brilliant blue, pink and purple, and rockets race into the night sky, exploding in a crescendo of sparkle. 3. Make new friends at the Disney Cruises kids' clubs Discover the kids’ clubs on board the Disney cruise ships. They boast acres of space dedicated to age-specific children’s activities, whether you have tots who want to dress up as their favourite princess or hero, or teens who like to drink smoothies and make new friends. Amazing interactive areas create magical worlds for young passengers. They can become toy-sized as they explore the enormous delights of Andy’s Room from Toy Story or join a land of fairies in Pixie Hollow, a pretty area dotted with mushroom stools and a twinkling tree and inspired by the Tinkerbell movies. Whatever their age, your kids will be entertained and amused for hours in the themed kids clubs, leaving you free to soak up the sun at the adults-only pool or lay back, relax and enjoy some child-free time with a treatment in the ship’s spa. 4. Live like a film star at Hollywood Studios Celebrate Hollywood’s golden age with rides and attractions based on the best blockbusters at Hollywood Studios in Walt Disney World. Join Woody and Buzz Lightyear for fun and games in Toy Story Midway Mania and take a tour through Hollywood’s most famous films on the aptly-named Great Movie Ride. Scream if you want to go faster on the 60mph Rock ’n’ Roller Coaster starring Aerosmith and take your chances in a creaky lift on The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. Amazing shows, including an Indiana Jones Stunt Spectacular, Beauty and the Beast Live on Stage and even a Frozen sing-along, bring the best films to life. 5. Kick back at Castaway Cay The magic of a Disney cruise doesn’t just begin and end on board the amazing ships. Castaway Cay is a private island port of call exclusively for Disney guests and continues the magic surrounded by white sands and azure waters. Enjoy snorkelling and boating, parasailing and fun-filled play areas, not to mention character meet-and-greets and open-air barbecues. Teens have their own Hide-Out area and adults can even relax with a treatment in special ocean-view massage cabanas. 6. Tickle your taste buds at the World Showcase Try a taste of different foods at Epcot’s World Showcase, featuring the culture and cuisine of 11 countries: Mexico, Norway, China, Germany, Italy, US, Japan, Morocco, France, Canada and the UK. Sample everything from German beer and French onion soup, to Italian gelato, American funnel cake, Mexican tequila – even good old fish and chips! 7. Dine on the high seas Dining is just as fun on board the Disney ships. Share the fun as you dine and swap stories in one of the three main dining restaurants on board, such as Animators Palate which serves up more than just delicious food. As you tuck into Pacific-inspired cuisine in amazing surroundings that look as if they’ve been drawn by hand, an innovative dinner show will bring the art of Disney storytelling and animation to life. Characters will leap into action on the walls right before your eyes to tell a story with the help of Sorcerer Mickey. On some ships, you can even draw your own character then see it become part of the show. 8. Make a splash at Blizzard Beach Ever wondered what happens when a ski resort melts? Well you can find out at Blizzard Beach, one of Disney’s two water parks, where Mount Gushmore has turned into an exciting water slide and the Runoff Rapids and Toboggan Racers echo with the screams of delighted thrill-seekers. If you really want to see what you’re made of, take on the near-vertical drop of the Summit Plummet – then recover as you bob on the waves in Melt-Away Bay and float along Cross Country Creek. 9. Swim while you're at sea Wallow awhile in one of the pools aboard your Disney cruise ship, or get wet in the themed splash zones with pop jets, bubblers and fountains, tubes and slides. Disney Cruise Line offers fun, themed freshwater pools for kids, families and adults on all ships and is even home to the first water coaster at sea. On Disney Dream, Aquaduck plunges you down four decks and whisks you over the edge of the ship, all while offering great sea views – if you’re brave enough to open your eyes and look! 10. Join in at a pirate party Finally, join a deck party for an amazing show. Pirates in the Caribbean is a fun-filled celebration, from dinner (complete with a treasure map-style menu) to the activities and character-filled delights offered on the pool deck afterwards. Captain Hook and Mr Smee may be determined to take over the ship, but they are no match for Mickey and his friends. As your favourite characters save the day, stand by for a spectacular fireworks display – the first to be offered on a cruise ship at sea. • Find out more about Disney Cruises, Disney holidays and Walt Disney World", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T14:17:41.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
