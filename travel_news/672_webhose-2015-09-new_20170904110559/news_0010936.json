Revenue passenger miles (RPMs), or traffic, increased 1.7 per cent year over year, and capacity, measured in available seat miles (ASMs), grew 7.3 per cent over the same period. The airline flew a record 2.0 million guests in August, a year-over-year increase of 2.3 per cent or approximately 44,000 additional guests, and achieved an on-time performance rate of 84.0 per cent in the month, an improvement of 6.3 percentage points year over year.\n“We are pleased with our continued traffic growth as we welcomed almost two million guests on board in August, setting a new single-month record even as the Labour Day long weekend shifted out of August this year. The movement of this busy travel period into September contributed to the year-over-year decline from the all-time high load factor reported in August last year,” said WestJet President and CEO Gregg Saretsky . “My thanks go out to our more than 10,000 WestJetters for their continuing energy and passion through this busy summer period.”\nAugust 2015 traffic results\nAugust 2015 August 2014 Change Load factor 84.6% 89.3% (4.7 pts) ASMs (billions) 2.432 2.267 7.3% RPMs (billions) 2.057 2.023 1.7% Year-to-date 2015 Year-to-date 2014 Change Load factor 80.9% 82.7% (1.8 pts) ASMs (billions) 18.279 17.223 6.1% RPMs (billions) 14.788 14.243 3.8% In August, WestJet took delivery of the first of its four wide-body Boeing 767-300ERW aircraft.
