In conjunction with the event, Carnival made a donation to Jordan's charity, The Brian Jordan Foundation, which helps children and their families improve their quality of life. \nThe Carnival Kids' Corner programming offered a variety of fun activities, as well as complimentary cooking demonstrations, with Chef D'Souza teaming up with locally and nationally-celebrated chefs to prepare simple, healthy dishes for children and their families. \n\"Creating delicious meals and entertaining is an integral part of the Carnival cruise experience, and something we love to share with our guests,\" said D'Souza. \"We were thrilled to be able to offer demonstrations at Taste of Atlanta of recipes that families can recreate at home or enjoy aboard our ships,\" he added. \nCarnival is the number one cruise line for families, carrying more than 700,000 kids annually. \nLaunched in 2014, Seuss at Sea is a fleetwide program featuring exciting youth, family, dining and entertainment experiences inspired by the amazing world and words of Dr. Seuss. The program includes such fun activities as the Seuss-a-palooza Parade and Story Time, as well as character interactions, Dr. Seuss books, toys, games and popular movies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T21:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T20:31:24.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
