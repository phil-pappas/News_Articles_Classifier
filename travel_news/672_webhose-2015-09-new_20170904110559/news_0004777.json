In 2016, it also plans to open its first theme park, Discovery Adventures Park, in China. DOUBLING DOWN ON THE PARTY IN LAS VEGAS The resorts of Las Vegas routinely encompass casinos and nightclubs, but rarely do the two venues merge. The new Lavo Casino Club at the Palazzo Las Vegas, opened last weekend, with gambling, roving cocktail carts, Italian food and a D.J. and dance floor. The operation, from the Tao Group, which operates many restaurants and clubs in Las Vegas and New York, offers craps and blackjack, and groups can reserve a private blackjack table for gambling strictly among friends (roulette and baccarat are yet to come). Located upstairs from Lavo restaurant, the casino club will be open on Friday and Saturday nights. With an eye to taking some sports book traffic, the club will open on Saturdays at 11 a.m. and Sundays at 9 a.m. during football season. ON THE MISSISSIPPI, A CAMPAIGN EXCURSION For political junkies, American Queen Steamboat Company will introduce a new “Presidents & Politics” itinerary on the Mississippi River next summer. The 436-passenger American Queen will travel from Cincinnati to St. Louis with stops at Louisville and Paducah, Ky., among others. Most of the election-themed content will take place aboard the ship in the form of guest speakers and historians who will discuss past presidents rather than wade into contemporary debates. The eight-night cruise departs July 17 with fares from $2,149 per person. DISCOUNTS ON RAIN-FOREST CRUISES Flexibility — and sometimes procrastination — can often yield travel bargains, which is the case today with Rainforest Cruises . The Florida-based agency, which specializes in South American cruises, is offering between $350 to $1,700 per person off on several last-minute Amazon cruises in Peru aboard the 14-cabin Delfin II. The best deal, a $1,999-per-person that normally sells for $3,699, departs Sept. 30 for five days. The others, priced from $2,849 for four days, depart twice in October and once in December.
