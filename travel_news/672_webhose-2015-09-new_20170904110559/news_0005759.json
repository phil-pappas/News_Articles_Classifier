They focused on quakes off the coast of Crete and Sicily, as can be seen in the map above, which shows the boundary of the plates\nA tsunami off the coast of Sicily would send a wave radiating out but the islands high cliffs along its coastline would protect it from being badly inundated with water itself. However, as can be seen in the maps above, large parts of southern Italy and Greece would be hit with by waves within just minutes of an earthquake\nSmall earthquakes and tremors are common in the region, as are a handful of active volcanoes.\nHowever, large earthquakes can occur if tension in the plates builds up and large slippages can trigger tsunamis that radiate out across the Mediterranean.\nThe researchers found that coastal areas where some 130 million people live would be at risk from such waves.\nThe researchers used land elevation to model how far the sea would inundate the coastline lines of Sicily (pictured top) and Crete (pictured bottom)\nAnd they estimate water levels could rise by up to a 3ft (1 metre) with large waves in places where the water grew shallower.\nThere would also be little warning of such a tsunami as the distance they have to travel is small. Large parts of Libya's coastline would also be hit by the waves, they warned.\nWithin about 16 minutes, the simulations estimate the waves would have spread across much of the Mediterranean sea.\nTo study the impacts the team developed a computer model to represent how tsunamis in the Mediterranean could form, propagate and hit the coast.\nThey used information about the seafloor depth, shoreline and topography.\nDr Samaras said: 'We simulate tsunami generation by introducing earthquake-generated displacements at either the sea bed or the surface.\n'The model then simulates how these disturbances - the tsunami waves - propagate and are transformed as they reach the nearshore and inundate coastal areas.'\n'Due to the complexity of the studied phenomena, one should not arbitrarily extend the validity of the presented results by assuming that a tsunami with a magnitude at generation five times larger, for example, would result in an inundation area five times larger.\n'It is reasonable, however, to consider such results as indicative of how different areas in each region would be affected by larger events.'\nThe effects of an earthquake off the coast of Crete was more damaging due to its position in the eastern Meditteranean and lower coastline. Around 1.5 sq miles (3.8sq km) of land would be covered by water rushing in from the sea while the waves would hit southern Greece and parts of Turkey within minutes, as shown above\nThe researchers found low lying areas of coast in southwest Crete would be particularly vulnerable to tsunami waves (top left) while south east Sicily (bottom left) would be less prone due to the steep coastline.
