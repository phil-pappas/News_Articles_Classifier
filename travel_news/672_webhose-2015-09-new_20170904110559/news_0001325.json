The new YouTube channel will feature short videos showing some of the beautiful and varied destinations where holidaymakers can stay in self-catering properties promoted by Simply Seaviews. Simply Seaviews - which only promotes cottages by the sea with unobscured sea views - recently published a video all about Devon, highlighting the many reasons which make this an ideal holiday destination for visitors to and from the UK. The film features images of spectacular coastal scenery, picturesque fishing harbours, beautiful beaches and wildlife to be discovered in Devon’s two sensational national parks - Exmoor and Dartmoor. Josh Williams from Simply Seaviews said: “Devon is one of the most beautiful regions in the UK, if not the world. It has something to offer everyone, from the surf of the north coast to the sheltered bays of the south coast and the dramatic scenery in between. There are visitor attractions galore and plenty of smart places to eat and drink. It’s a holidaymaker’s dream and we try to capture some of the highlights in our short introductory video.” To accompany the video on Devon, the company plans to release a series of short videos on other destinations featured on its website. Locations such as Norfolk, Suffolk and Scotland also feature in its list of top sea view holiday destinations and will feature in videos to be added to the YouTube channel in the near future. Since launching the YouTube channel, Simply Seaviews has received many positive comments about it’s short and simple films showcasing top coastal locations around the UK. “YouTube is a great platform to help spread the message about the beautiful coastal locations people can visit here in the UK,” commented Mr Williams. “If a picture says a thousand words, a video says tens of thousands in its ability to succinctly convey the highlights of a holiday destination. We look forward to adding more films soon.” To see the collection of holiday cottages close to the locations featured in the Devon video visit this page: http://simplyseaviews.co.uk/devon # # #", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T22:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T21:13:41.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
