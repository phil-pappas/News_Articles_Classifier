ThomasNet ® and Institute for Supply Management ® (ISM ® ) are inviting the industry to recognize these achievers as \"30 Under 30 Rising Supply Chain Stars\". Today, the organizations issued a reminder that the nomination deadline for their second annual recognition program is just weeks away. All nominations must be submitted online by October 30, 2015 .\nWhat makes a rising star? One example is Nicholas (Nick) Ammaturo , 30, Director, Profit Improvement and Procurement at Hudson's Bay Company, New York , who is among the first group of honorees. In his short tenure in supply management, he has built procurement operations from scratch, implemented a global supply chain system, and delivered significant savings. Mr. Ammaturo also actively gives back through professional organizations, where he spearheads initiatives to bring young people into supply management.\nBy celebrating emerging leaders like Nick Ammaturo , ThomasNet and ISM hope to create awareness and interest in supply management careers among Millennials-the talent generation that is needed to fill the gaps left by retiring Baby Boomers. According to research from consulting firm Deloitte, the demand for industry talent might soon exceed supply by a ratio of six to one.\n\"Supply management professionals have a direct impact on companies' financial performance, and our industry must continue attracting the 'best and brightest' to maximize our contribution. We're urging everyone to stake a claim in our collective future by nominating a rising star,\" said Tom Derry , CEO of ISM.\nIndividuals are invited to nominate young professionals whose innovation, leadership, initiative and/or collaboration are benefiting their organizations, associations or the industry at large. Anyone in the private or public sector who will be 30 or younger by December 31, 2015 is eligible.\nEach of the 30 winners will be rewarded with a free one-year membership in ISM. The \"megawatt star\" among them, and their nominator, will receive an all-expense-paid trip to ISM's 2016 annual conference, May 16-18 in Indianapolis .\nTo nominate a Rising Star by October 30 , please go to www.ThomasNet.com/30under30 .\nAbout Institute for Supply Management ®\nFounded in 1915 as the first supply management institute in the world, Institute for Supply Management ® (ISM ® ) is committed to advancing the practice of supply management to drive value and competitive advantage for its members, contributing to a prosperous and sustainable world.
