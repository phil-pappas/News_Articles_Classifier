Full-boat charters for families or small groups during the same period are also available at 10% off. Bookings must be made by December 31, 2015.\nFor example, a 6-night cruise on board the elegant, 8-passenger Anjodi on the historic Canal du Midi in the South of France, departing on April 3 or April 10, is reduced from $4,690 to $4,220 per person, based on double occupancy. A full-boat charter for a family or group of up to eight passengers is reduced from $35,000 to $31,500 – representing even more of a saving per person.\nThe cruises feature a crew of four, including a gourmet chef, and include all gourmet meals, fine wines, open bar, daily escorted excursions, and opportunities for independent exploration on the barges’ bicycles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:05:49.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
