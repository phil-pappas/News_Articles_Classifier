The key, of course, is knowing where to go and where you may be able to save some meal money. \nFall is my favorite time to visit the islands and it’s also a busy time in the restaurant industry and new venues open in preparation for what they hope to be a busy holiday season. \nLet’s see what’s new with the restaurants, cafés and other food relates locations on Oahu and even in the air! \nBills Sydney in Waikiki Bills Sydney in Waikiki has unveiled a new menu upstairs and at its downstairs café offering fresh, innovative organic fare including a range of grab-and-go options to take to the beach. Diners can enjoy granola yogurt parfaits, an eclectic range of sandwiches, light and easy salads, poke bowls and Bills’ famous coffees. \nBread + Butter Bread + Butter is a new island-style café serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. Diners can enjoy an artisan coffee program developed by master roaster Raymond Suiter and in the evening, indulge in a wonderful selection of pinots handpicked by master sommelier Roberto Viernes at the Pinot Bar. The concept is brought together by executive chef Arnoldo “Masa” Gushiken, offering grab and go soups, salads, sandwiches and pizzas by day and Spanish tapas by night. \nHale Ohuna Chef Lee Anne Wong opened Hale Ohuna, a modern Hawaiian noodle bar, in early September. Hale Ohuna, which means secret home, is Wong’s second Kaimuki restaurant. In addition to delicious noodle dishes, the restaurant bar features an eclectic mix of spirits that are near and dear to Wong’s heart including high quality whiskies and exclusive sakes not found in Hawaii. \nHawaiian Airlines Hawaiian Airlines and chef Lee Anne Wong of Koko Head Café have collaborated to create menus now being served on all flights from Japan to Hawaii. Starting Dec. 1, chef Lee Anne will also be the next chef in line for the airline’s hugely popular Featured Chef Series, which will showcase her cuisine in the first class cabin on flights from Hawaii to the U.S. Mainland. \nHoku’s The Kahala Hotel & Resort’s award-wining Hoku’s presents a new dinner menu designed by recently appointed chef de cuisine, Hiroshi Inoue. Maintaining the signature Hoku’s style that has become world renown with both locals and visitors, Inoue has incorporated Asian and the Mediterranean influences into the new menu using inspiration from his travels around the world. \nHonolulu Coffee Experience Center Honolulu Coffee is prepping to open its 9,000-square-foot Honolulu Coffee Experience Center.
