The partnership, formed with another Indiana based company, includes an FAA Exemption 333, the designation required to offer legal commercial aerial photography using cost- effective, multi-rotor aircraft, commonly known as drones.\n\"This exemption was imperative to our ever-growing business model of working with towns, cities and municipalities across Indiana ,\" said Principal Partner of Clear Vision Media, Chris Sanchez . \"Many firms don't realize when hiring an aerial drone photographer they need to have a legal exemption from the FAA. This is critical when we are working with cities, municipalities and governmental agencies liable for project costs and damages.\"\nWithin the first week of this new partnership, the Steuben County Tourism Bureau and the Steuben County Economic Development Corporation commissioned Clear Vision Media to map more than 2,000 acres. This included shovel ready locations prepped for expanding industrial sites, multiple corridors , industrial buildings and county industrial parks.\nTechnologies used in the project include an aerial drone for 3D mapping and a fleet of HDR imagery drones. According to Sanchez, having a qualified commercial pilot coupled with a strategic marketing company such as Clear Vision Media is a huge advantage for securing high-level projects.\n\"We also are able to incorporate aerial 360 degree panoramic views that are simply spectacular for tourism and economic development organizations,\" says Brent Rouse of Clear Vision Media and Indiana Aerial Solutions.\n\"We first saw this technology from the Steuben County Tourism Bureau and immediately recognized the benefits it provides for economic development,\" said the Executive Director of the Steuben County Economic Development Corporation, David Koenig . \"The 3D mapping and 360 aerial panoramic views that accurately show a 3-mile radius with a single image were especially beneficial.\"\n\"Our new technology will shave money off development budgets and shorten site development timelines for economic developers,\" concluded CVM's Sanchez. \"Flying with great accuracy, our FAA sanctioned pilot has many advantages, such as capturing site images that can be used to accurately estimate how much earth must be moved on a given site and compare it to other sites-before the site feasibility team or the prospect has even set foot on the ground.\"\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/clear-vision-media-soars-high-to-impact-economic-development-with-faa-sanctioned-commercial-drone-operations-for-the-state-of-indiana-300145214.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://steubenedc.com/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.classicpressroom.com/pressroom/category/136-i-80-90.html", "http://steubenedc.com/life/tourism/", "http://clearvision.media/", "http://www.classicpressroom.com/pressroom/images/press_rooms/clear_vision_media/21_Acres_Rotatable_PDF.pdf", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/clear-vision-media-soars-high-to-impact-economic-development-with-faa-sanctioned-commercial-drone-operations-for-the-state-of-indiana-300145214.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=CG05458&Transmission_Id=201509171633PR_NEWS_USPR_____CG05458&DateId=20150917"], "published": "2015-09-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T02:13:44.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
