Photo courtesy of Zocalo Public Square\nEVELYN PALACIOS\nI’m from El Salvador, I moved to East Los Angeles five years ago. I was here on my own. You have to start from zero in a new country. You have to speak a new language and leave your family behind. It was really hard at first, but it’s gotten better.\nI have three kids. I take them to the movies every Saturday. It’s our thing. We’re taking the bus to the Commerce movie theater tomorrow to watch Minions. I don’t really have time for myself—everything is for my kids. When I get home I’m gonna make their favorite dinner: Pupusas with cheese and revueltas (chicharrón, cheese and beans).\nWhittier Boulevard to Soto Street\n#myLAcommute is a project of Zócalo Public Square .", "external_links": ["http://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/mylacommute/you-have-to-start-from-zero-in-a-new-country/"], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T00:13:40.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
