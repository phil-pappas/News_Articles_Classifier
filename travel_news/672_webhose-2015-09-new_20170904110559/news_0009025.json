Reputed foreign agencies have also certified to this, they claimed. \nGiving figures, the Nepal industry players said that several teams have been given permits for trekking and mountaineering now. \nA panel has been formed by the government for the revival of tourism, called the Nepal Tourism Promotion Committee, to specifically address the post-quake issues. \nSeveral trade teams have been sent to shows and destinations to convey the message that Nepal is back on top of the world. \nNepal Airlines has resumed flights to Mumbai and Bangalore, and is offering a special buy-two-get-one-free package. \nIndia is and has been a major source for Nepal, but the recent political turmoil in the country impacted tourism, senior officers admitted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T02:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T03:26:11.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
