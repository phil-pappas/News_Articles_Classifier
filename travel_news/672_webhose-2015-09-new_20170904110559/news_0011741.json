Or shot down a water slide that juts right over the side of your cruise ship? Then you probably haven’t enjoyed the magic of a Disney holiday . Meeting your favourite characters, the thrill of the rides and special dining options are just half the fun. Whichever thrilling experience you opt for, it will be met with cries of “Again! Again!” There is a whole host of unique experiences to help you create those unforgettable family memories, whether you are at Walt Disney World in Florida or experiencing the magic on board a Disney cruise. Thrills and spills go hand-in-hand on Disney’s cruise ships, thanks to the world’s first water coasters at sea. Disney Dream and Disney Fantasy were the first ships to feature the elevated water coaster AquaDuck, developed by Disney Imagineers. Spanning four decks, the thrilling coaster takes you up, down, around and off the side of the ship on a 765ft-long adventure in a transparent tube. Flume fun: AquaDunk involves an incredible 37ft vertical drop Whizz from Deck 12 through the forward funnel and drop four decks into the water below – if you’re brave enough to keep your eyes open you’ll get stunning views of the ship as you whip around. Disney Magic also features the adrenaline pumping AquaDunk – a high-speed three-storey body slide located at the forward funnel on Deck 14, which involves a 37ft vertical drop and a high-octane adventure 20ft out over the side of the ship. From water coasters on Disney Cruise ships to roller coasters at Walt Disney World, there are big thrills to be found on land and at sea. The six parks at Walt Disney World each offer a new adventure, from Space Mountain’s rip-roaring rocket ride to Splash Mountain’s five-storey splashdown. Adrenaline junkie: You're guaranteed to get wet on the Kali River Rapids At Epcot the wonder of space travel comes alive and thrill seekers can experience a simulation of a shuttle launch in the NASA-style training on the Mission: SPACE attraction. Amongst the glitz and glamour of Disney’s Hollywood Studios there are fun frights to be had in the “stretch limo” which blasts off from 0 to 60mph and takes you hurtling along the darkened streets of LA on your way to an Aerosmith concert on the Rock ’n’ Roller Coaster, or the spooktacular sensation of a haunted lift in The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, which creaks up to the 13th floor before sending you plummeting to the ground surrounded by the screams of fellow passengers. At Disney’s Animal Kingdom, encounter some of the most exotic animals in the world alongside amazing safari experiences – there are some thrilling rides. Take a speeding train ride through the Himalayas on Expedition Everest as you dash to avoid the clutches of the Yeti then plunge down a raging river through the lush jungle on the Kali River Rapids. You’re guaranteed to end your adventure rather wetter than when you started. Gravity defying: the Crush 'n' Gusher watercoaster has plenty of twists and turns You can also make a splash with the whole family at Disney’s Typhoon Lagoon. Take a trip in twos on the watercoaster Crush ’n’ Gusher and defy gravity by travelling uphill before plunging, twisting and turning your way through the 400ft-long tube and emerging on your raft at Hideaway Bay. Fit the whole family into one raft for the Gang Plank Falls and fight the rushing rapids on a 300ft waterslide or brave the near vertical five-storey drop in the darkness on the Humunga Kowabunga. At Disney’s Blizzard Beach – a melting ski resort packed with fun – you can race each other on the Downhill Double Dipper or challenge your family to try the extreme Summit Plummet, travelling at up to 55mph down a sheer 120ft slope on one of the tallest, fastest freefall body slides in the world. Whichever thrilling experience you opt for, you can guarantee it will be met with cries of “Again!
