The term is long and tiring for children; long-haul trips in 10 days may be too ambitious. It is also a difficult time of year to find reliably good weather in short-haul destinations; southern parts of Europe offer excellent value at this time of year, but sunshine is not guaranteed. \nThis year, most half-term holidays start on Friday, October 23.
