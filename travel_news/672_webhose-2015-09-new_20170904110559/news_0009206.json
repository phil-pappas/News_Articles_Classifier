Her name on a key yard that handles important segments of our business â€“ in her own hometown -- is apt and well-deserved recognition.\"\nHarris Yard is situated on NS' mainline from Birmingham and Chattanooga and is located in the midtown area of Memphis , near the Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium and not far from Graceland, Elvis Presley's home. Harris Yard is a focal point for traffic moving east and west, as NS interchanges in Memphis with the UP, BNSF, and CN railroads. The yard also is home to NS' 38-acre truck-to-rail transfer facility that connects Memphis' intermodal shippers to global markets via six days per week rail service to and from the major container port facilities on the U.S. Southeastern coast.\nJoining Norfolk Southern in 1978 as a customer account auditor, Butler was named to positions of increasing responsibility in operations, including assistant vice president transportation customer services in 2000 and vice president customer service in 2002, before being named EVP planning and chief information officer in 2007.\nButler is recognized for her expertise in car management and distribution. Early in her career, she oversaw modernization of many of NS' core transportation systems, such as ITMS for transportation information sharing, TYES for yard management and inventory, RIT for remote work orders, and the Pacesetter customer portal.\nMore recently her tenure saw implementation of the optimized dispatching system to improve network velocity, significant progress toward installation of Positive Train Control systems, successful negotiation to purchase 282 miles of Delaware and Hudson Railway Co. lines to support rail service in the Northeast, and a growing commitment to sustainable business practices. Butler also is known for her work in mentoring new railroaders -- she helped start WiNS (Women in Norfolk Southern), the railroad's first official employee resource group.\n\"Deb's contributions in technology, the environment, and employee development have made a lasting difference,\" Squires said. \"Our board, officers, and employees are grateful for her vision and leadership.\"\nAbout Norfolk Southern\nNorfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) is one of the nation's premier transportation companies. Its Norfolk Southern Railway Company subsidiary operates approximately 20,000 route miles in 22 states and the District of Columbia , serves every major container port in the eastern United States , and provides efficient connections to other rail carriers.
