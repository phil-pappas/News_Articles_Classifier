All they needed was a vessel to bring the fantasy to life.\n'Food trucks were starting to catch on the mainland US and we thought it could work on the water just as well as it does on land,' Tara said.\n'Our search for the perfect hull still came up empty after three years of crawling through boat yards.\n'One day, we went to our good friend Kevin Gray (known lover of derelict boats) to ask him to keep an eye out for our perfect boat. Little did we know, we were sitting on the bow of what would become Pizza Pi.'\nThe boat was the perfect size and shape for installing a commercial-grade pizza kitchen but renovating it would take two years.\nThankfully Sasha was an engineer by trade - and YouTube was on hand to help with anything they didn't know.\nIn 2014 Pizza Pi became a reality, officially providing pizza to any boater in the US Virgin Islands who wanted to stop for a tasty meal.\nAll hands on deck: Tara helps out in the kitchen, although they are looking to take on some new recruits for the upcoming season\nDIY pizza joint: Sasha has a background in engineering, but YouTube videos were used as tutorials when they needed extra guidance\nmore videos 1 2 3 Watch video Thorne Travel's 'best worst' promo video becomes an online hit\nWatch video Incredible battle between wild dogs and hyenas\nWatch video Adrenaline junkies try out the incredible Fun Air Slide\nWatch video Crocodile Dundee promises tourists a 'shrimp on the barbie'\nWatch video 'Where the Bloody Hell Are Ya?'

We did not sell out, we were able to keep up with demand all day long.\n'We live on the east end of St. Thomas, close enough to the beach that we can walk to the water, jump in the dinghy and head out to Pi for work each day. Not a bad commute!\n'We anchor in the same bay every day so we’re easy to find.\n'Power boats raft up to us to order and eat, and we offer pizza delivery within Christmas Cove if you want to anchor or moor.'\nTheir pizza has made them the top-rated restaurant on TripAdvisor , with the majority of customers giving them a five-star rating.\nAnd now they are hiring.\nThey are looking for a business manager, food prep staff member and a provisioner to join them when they reopen after the hurricane season in November.
