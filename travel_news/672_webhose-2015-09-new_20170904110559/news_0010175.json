FAO will offer policy advice and technical support to ensure that climate change adaptation priorities in the agriculture, forestry, and fisheries sectors are incorporated in this planning process. UNDP will engage with countries in managing climate risk, in planning and budgeting, and help them strengthen information systems, project formulation, and coordination between government institutions. \nThe initiative has immediate potential to link with and amplify existing programs in the target countries and improve their prospects for accessing global funds for climate finance, such as the Global Environment Fund and the Green Climate Fund. \nFunding for the $12 million effort is being provided by Germany's Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB). \n\"Our food security in the decades to come depends on our collective ability to innovate and adapt to climate change. The agriculture sector is critical to every nation and is a lifeline for livelihoods. Therefore, FAO and UNDP have joined forces to support partner countries to integrate agriculture into National Adaptation Planning (NAP) processes,\" said Adriana Dinu, Executive Coordinator UNDP Global Environment Finance Unit. \n\"Ministries of agriculture, fisheries and forestry need to be at the table when countries develop and implement domestic policies to address climate change,\" added Martin Frick, Director of FAO's Climate, Energy and Tenure Division.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T04:38:59.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
