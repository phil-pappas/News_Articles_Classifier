The application of autonomous underwater vehicles technology has evolved in the commercial sector where the number of AUVs being used for offshore surveys and other tasks is increasing at a rapid pace. The global autonomous underwater vehicles market is led by North America accounting for a share of 63% in 2014. The autonomous underwater vehicles market based on application is mainly led by defense and commercial sectors. As the autonomous underwater vehicles technology continues to improve; it is expected to find new applications across sectors and in different geographic regions where autonomous underwater robots are rarely used at present.\nThree types of autonomous underwater vehicles have been covered in this report – shallow, medium, and large. This report covers the said market in four main regions– North America , Europe , Asia-Pacific , and Rest of the World (RoW).\nMajor drivers identified for the autonomous underwater vehicles market are the rising importance of AUVs in defense, maritime security, and research, growing energy needs, and rising investments into offshore oil & gas drilling. However, stringent government regulation, high initial cost, and investment in research and development are key factors that are restraining the growth of the AUV market.\nThe report also discusses the future road-map of the global autonomous underwater vehicles market with respect to upcoming technologies, potential markets, and applications of the same. The key players in this industry include Kongsberg Maritime ( Norway ), Teledyne Technologies (U.S.), Bluefin Robotics Corporation (U.S.), Saab AB ( Sweden ), ECA SA ( France ), Ocean Server Technology, Inc. (U.S.) and others.\nRead the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p03215237-summary/view-report.html\nAbout Reportlinker\nReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution that finds, filters and organizes the latest industry data so you get all the market research you need - instantly, in one place.\nhttp://www.reportlinker.com", "external_links": ["http://www.reportlinker.com/", "http://www.reportlinker.com/p03215237-summary/view-report.html"], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T20:49:06.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
