Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Sep 07, 2015 eTN   \nToday’s work environment in the hospitality industry is rapidly changing with every new technology and the latest craze – apps - coming on the market literally every day. Original training of hotel staff covered plenty of aspects of what to expect in the workplace, but one thing is clear - the relentless march into the e-age requires more training to stay abreast with the latest trends. \nA series of workshops have been launched in Nairobi, the first taking place on September 9, where in particular reception staff can learn what is new and how to use the latest technologies to make their work easier, respond faster, and capture transactions for a range of statistical and accounts measures. \nThe one-day seminar and workshop will address critical aspects of online tourism including: online bookings and reservation, customer relations, social media, hotel review platforms, online payments, and value-added service. According to a report by the World Travel and Tourism and Council (WTTC), more than 59% of travel bookings are currently done online, while a report by Euro Monitor stated that travelers will usually visit 14 different sites before finally placing their online booking. It’s important to note that in the event where customers will not book online, 96% of the traveling population will still do their primary travel research on the Internet. \nThis leaves to no doubt about the importance for any accommodation supplier to come up with an online strategy as well as get fully involved with the latest booking trends emerging in the market. It’s also important to notice that sometimes it’s not just about pricing when it comes to a customer’s preference but also about available amenities such as Wi-Fi and other perks and the availability of a mobile booking option as proven by Jovago Customer Booking Trends research earlier this year, sponsor of the workshop being conducted at the Pride Inn in Westlands, Nairobi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T02:18:41.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
