A seasonal cocktail also is available, as well as breakfast and lunch features.\n“Pumpkins are a surprising versatile vegetable, as they lend themselves to both savoury and sweet preparations,” says Executive Sous Chef Joey Cavaretta. “At Proof, we are using pumpkins to inspire dishes throughout the entire day, beginning with breakfast and ending with a cocktail incorporating the warmth and spice of this seasonal ingredient.”\nThe three-course dinner menu will feature a first course of roasted pumpkin soup, with cinnamon, sage and crème fraiche. For the entrée, spiced maple-glazed duck confit legs will be served with caramelised pear, roasted pumpkin and pumpkin seeds. Dessert will highlight a pumpkin spice milkshake, with vanilla whipped cream and graham cracker crisps. The cost for the three-course menu is USD 38, or USD 48 with optional seasonal beer pairings for the first two courses. The menu is also available a la carte.\nGuests also can select the seasonal cocktail, It’s The Great Pumpkin with butterscotch liqueur, vanilla vodka, spiced rum, cream, pumpkin simple syrup and pumpkin spice. Visit Proof for breakfast to enjoy donut french toast with pumpkin cream cheese, pumpkin cranberry syrup and graham cracker crumbles, or enjoy pumpkin spice coffee cake.
