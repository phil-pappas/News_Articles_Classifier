It is history in the making, as these Games will be coming to the African continent for the first time. South Africa is under reconstruction and development, as we are building this new country which is non-racial, non-sexist, and democratic. “The Games will be used to promote social cohesion and build our nation. Hosting the games will give our young people an opportunity to showcase their talent on the world stage in 2022, because we want them to be the champions of tomorrow.” \nThis year’s SETEconference which takes place on the 28th&29thOctober 2015 in Tshwane and will again focus on the need for the Industry to support Durban in its preparations over the next seven years to stage a successful Commonwealth Games, a first for Africa.
