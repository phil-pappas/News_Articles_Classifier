Guests at the four star resort can now combine golf on two championship courses, The Prince Bishops and The Cathedral, with relaxation in the spa and restorative treatments created exclusively for golfers. \nRamside’s luxury spa is aiming to establish a reputation as one of the best in the UK. Facilities includes a 25 metre swimming pool, gym and exercise studios, outdoor vitality pool, hydrotherapy and infinity pools, herbal sauna and Himalayan salt steam room, a sunken amphitheater sauna, sleep sanctuary and thermal suite with soundwave therapy beds. The spa also has 14 treatment rooms offering a range of treatments using ESPA products. Jill Russell, spa director at Spa at Ramside, said: “Ramside Hall is excited to welcome golfers who like to combine playing great courses with wellness, rest and relaxation. Our new golf and spa breaks offer a perfect opportunity for couples and groups of friends who want to escape and unwind, either on the golf course, in a hydrotherapy pool or in the care of an expert beauty and wellness therapist.” Visitors to the resort can now choose from a golf & spa overnight break, a one day golf and spa experience or a wellness treatment called Golfer’s Tonic, designed to relieve the physical stresses of playing golf.
