Watching with interest is Airbräu’s brewmaster René Jacobsen (right), who created “Gaudium” for this year’s festivities – a fresh and smooth, bottom-fermented lager with an alcohol content of 5.9 percent.\nAppropriately for the Oktoberfest – affectionately known in Munich as the “fifth season” – it will be served in traditional glass steins.\nSetting the mood for the occasion were folk dance groups from the region and a “goasslschnalzer” whip-cracking performance, accompanied by the municipal brass band from nearby Erding. Just in time for the Oktoberfest, two new shops – Gössl, a long-established seller of regional clothing, and the Trachtenkult Shop – have opened their doors at the airport.\nThey offer a wide selection of lederhosen, dirndl dresses and hats for those who want to pass as locals when raising a stein in the beer tent. A pop-up store operated by Munich’s Hofbräuhaus in Terminal 2 offers souvenirs of the world’s most famous beer hall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T15:34:36.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
