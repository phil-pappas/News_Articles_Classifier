Carrying 3,400 pound machines on cross country treks, hauler drivers spend an above average time on the road at dusk or after dark and log upwards of 70,000 miles according to media reports. With 20 different states in the NASCAR Sprint ® Cup Series, navigating a hauler from track to track in less than ideal conditions can be challenging.\nNorth American lighting leader OSRAM SYLVANIA recognizes the magnitude of transporting such valuable cargo and the important role of visibility on hauler's trips in the dark. Through SYLVANIA Automotive Lighting's 'Hauler Headlights for Safe Nights' initiative, NASCAR haulers are upgraded with SYLVANIA SilverStar ® ULTRA headlights, which offer brighter downroad visibility with a whiter light for more clarity, in the SYLVANIA headlight family.\nThe sixth annual 'Hauler Headlights for Safer Nights' initiative kicked off in July at New Hampshire Motor Speedway (NHMS) during the first of two races at the venue and came full circle on Thursday, September 24 when the haulers made their debut into the infield for the weekend of the SYLVANIA 300 race.\n\"Hauler drivers can make road trips for nearly a 10 or 15 hour stretch and enhanced visibility is key for transporting over 80,000 pounds of cargo through the night,\" said Brian Noble , marketing manager, SYLVANIA Automotive Lighting. \"It's the hauler drivers that help make races like the SYLVANIA 300 a reality, and we love that we're able to help upgrade the visibility and the safety of their journeys from track to track.\"\nSYLVANIA SilverStar ULTRA headlights provide increased down and side road visibility when compared with SYLVANIA BASIC headlights. Upgrading to whiter, brighter headlights can help increase a driver's ability to react to distractions or hazards on the road.

The first video in the series offered an in-depth look at the journey of a hauler driver, showing a behind the scenes look at hauling a multi-million dollar machine around the country.
