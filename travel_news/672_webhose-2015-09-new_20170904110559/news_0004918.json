These heroes were among the first to relay the intelligence that alerted our country and our flying partners in flight 93, who in turn sacrificed their own lives to save countless others on the ground. \nImmediately following the horrific events, Flight Attendants and crewmembers helped usher millions of passengers home to their families and loved ones. Our work continues every day since then, adding to our role as first responder the responsibility as aviation's last line of defense. \nIn addition to a moment of silence observed at 8:46 am Eastern Time throughout our Flight Attendant Union, crewmembers are honoring our twenty-five Flight Attendant Heroes at remembrance services, by checking in to do our work as aviation's first responders or in other very personal and private ways. \nWe promised to Never Forget. We promised to Never Forget the events of that day and to ensure they never happen again. Our heroes will forever unite us.\" \nUnited Flight 175 \nFlight Attendant: Robert J.
