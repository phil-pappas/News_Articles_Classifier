However, not everyone knows how to obtain it or who can be covered by it, let alone the finer details such as what it covers, what it doesn’t, and how often it should be renewed. Here you will find a brief breakdown of how it works to help you make an informed decision. \nAm I Entitled to an EHIC? \nThe main thing to know when figuring out whether you are eligible for an EU medical card or not is whether you are ‘ordinarily resident of the UK and of British, other EU/EEA or Swiss nationality’. You may also be eligible if you live abroad (within the EEA) but receive a UK pension. \nIf you will be travelling with your family, it is important that every member has their own card. However, it is possible for a main applicant to apply on behalf of other family members within the same EHIC form. \nWhere Can I Find an EHIC Form? \nObtaining an EU medical card is surprisingly easy, and there are three paths you can follow. \nIf you go to ehic.org.uk, the official government website, you will easily find an online form that you can fill out. The process is very straightforward, simply asking you a few questions and checking your eligibility. If you meet the conditions, you will be covered straightaway. It is also possible to download an EHIC form to complete manually and post it to the NHS address provided, or to follow an automated telephone service. Either way, you will receive coverage for five years from the date on which you apply. \nWhat Does the EHIC Cover? \nYour EU medical card will provide you with ‘access to state provided healthcare’ in the EEA. This means that, essentially, in whichever country you travel to, you will receive the same level of free healthcare that a resident of that country would. \nThe EHIC includes cover for medical treatment following an injury or sudden illness, as well as routine medical care if you have a pre-existing medical condition that needs to be monitored during your stay abroad. \nSo is There Anything it Doesn’t Cover? \nUnfortunately, yes. Because you are only entitled to the ‘same level of care as a resident’ of the country you visit, you may be surprised to find that some services provided require a contribution or co-payment. \nThe EU medical card will not cover you if you have travelled abroad specifically to receive medical treatment, which includes giving birth, so please be aware of this when booking your holiday. \nAnything Else I Need to Know? \nIt is important to reiterate that the EHIC is not equivalent to travel insurance. Thus, it will not cover things like repatriation, should you need or want to return to the UK for further treatment. Without a private insurance policy that covers repatriation, the costs will fall back on you, which can prove very expensive. \nWhile remembering that the EHIC is not a substitute for travel insurance, do ensure that you apply for one alongside your private travel insurance before setting off abroad.   from ArticlesFactory.com ABOUT THE AUTHOR \nP.K.
