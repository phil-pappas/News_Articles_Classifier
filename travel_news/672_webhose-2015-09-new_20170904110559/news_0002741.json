It is 40 minutes by RER train from central Paris, hence it’s vital to know the geography of this outlying suburb, which is officially called Marne-la-Vallée. The area is roughly circular, with Disneyland at its hub, but none of our selection of hotels are more than 10 minutes’ drive from the parks and most offer their own free transport. All Disney hotels come with the benefit of early entry into the Disneyland Park, at least one Disney character on hand in the lobby each morning and the convenience of being within walking distance of everything; however most of the hotels listed below outside of the park will be cheaper, substantially in some cases. The Disneyland Hotel, Chessy \nThe grandest – and most expensive – resort in the area is the one built right over the entrance to the Disneyland Park. A mock Victorian building full of elegant public rooms, sumptuous style and excellent food and drink choices, it boasts the gourmet quality California Grill and bar-lounge of Café Fantasia, with suitable theming. The indoor pool is complemented by a fitness centre, sauna and steam room, as well as a wonderful spa. Standard rooms feature a king-sized bed and a fold-out or two doubles, while the spacious suites come with the bonus of a VIP FastPass for front-of-the-line access to most of both parks’ rides. \nFor more information, see: disneylandparis.co.uk/hotels/disneyland-hotel Disney’s Hotel New York, Chessy \nOne of three hotels on the edge of Lake Disney, this is still within easy walking distance of the parks. It has a 1930s Art Deco vibe with whimsical touches, but little overt Disney-ness, hence it has a more grown-up feel. Again, there are good food and drink offerings, with two restaurants – notably the formal Manhattan Restaurant – and New York City Bar with signature cocktails. It boasts a fabulous pool, with a clever indoor/outdoor design, plus a state-of-the-art gym, hair salon and tennis courts. Standard rooms comfortably sleep four, while a handful have king-beds only. The corner suites are huge. \nFor more information, see: disneylandparis.co.uk/hotels/disneys-hotel-new-york Disney’s Sequoia Lodge, Coupvray \nTaking its cue from America’s national parks, this wood-and-stone edifice also overlooks Lake Disney and is surrounded by gardens and greenery. The interior is just as impressive, notably around the inviting Redwood Bar, where the flagstone floor and open fireplace provide an atmosphere of rugged gentility. It is big, though, with 1,011 rooms split between the huge main building and five lodges around it. The large freeform pool also has an indoor/outdoor aspect, and the two restaurants provide a wide variety of family-friendly options. Its outdoor terrace is a gorgeous place to sit with a drink of a summer evening. \nFor more information, see: disneylandparis.co.uk/hotels/disneys-sequoia-lodge \nRead more: the best characterful Paris hotels Disney’s Hotel Cheyenne, Coupvray \nFans of the Wild West will love this cowboy-themed resort. It is also a notch or two cheaper than some of the others in this list. Rooms and facilities are a bit plainer, but the main building is constructed like a western village, from the Goldrush-era claims office that serves as the lobby to the Red Garter Saloon, which often features live music at peak periods. The rustic-style rooms feature kid-friendly bunk beds and are set in 14 identical blocks that are all named after historic characters such as Wyatt Earp and Billie The Kid. The two guest launderettes are a handy extra here, too. \nFor more information, see: disneylandparis.fr/hotels/disneys-hotel-cheyenne Vienna International Dream Castle Hotel, Magny-le-Hongre \nThe closest non-Disney area is that of Val de France, a short (free) bus ride from the parks. Here, five hotels provide a handy alternative to Disney’s on-site offerings, and Vienna International has two of the best. The Dream Castle is the grandest of the bunch, with majestic French chateau styling and a wonderful location backing on to extensive gardens and water feature. It offers a wide choice of room types, from family rooms to King suites, and terrific dining, notably at The Musketeers. The extensive breakfast buffet is also well above average and dinner outside on the terrace is enchanting in summer. \nFor more information, see: vi-hotels.com/en/dream-castle \nRead more: the best hotels in Paris Vienna International Magic Circus Hotel, Magny-le-Hongre \nThe sister hotel to the Dream Castle used to be a Holiday Inn – hence its slightly more identikit feel– but it still has its own extensive theming, excellent facilities and super-comfy Family rooms, that are highlighted by a curtained-off kids area with bunk beds and games consoles. There is a sophisticated indoor pool, smart fitness centre and extensive outdoor playground, so it caters well to both families and couples. Small touches, like the L’Occitane bathroom amenities, are noticeable here, and it all adds up to great value for money in this location. \nFor more information, see: vi-hotels.com/en/magic-circus Explorers Hotel Algonquin, Magny-le-Hongre \nWhen it comes to the best family hotel in the area, it’s hard to beat this option in Val de France. Its features are positively Disney-esque and there are so many children’s facilities it may be a struggle to get the kids out. It starts with a huge indoor play area and ends with the Secret Lagoon Swimming Pool, complete with water slides and toddler area. The array of dining options run from grab-and-go pizza parlour and café bar, to themed full-service restaurant. The room choice is also immensely thoughtful, with connecting sections that can sleep from two-10. \nFor more information, see: explorershotels.com/en Hotel Kyriad, Magny-le-Hongre \nThe fourth of the Val de France hotels, this is firmly in budget territory but still features larger-than-average rooms, quality-conscious dining and a French country-house style that makes for a relaxing refuge after a day at the parks. Again, families are their stock in trade as most rooms are configured with a double bed and two bunks, and the lobby features a children's play area, video games room and merry-go-round. The evening buffet is surprisingly good, with an array of choice for most tastes and appetites at a sensible price (€21 for adults, €9.50 for children 3-11). \nFor more information, see: disneylandparis.kyriad.fr/en \nRead more: the best characterful Paris hotels Radisson Blu Hotel, Magny-le-Hongre \nAnyone looking for a more executive style and less overtly family-orientated hotel should consider this rather chic Radisson property, which is located on the edge of Disney’s extensive 27-hole golf complex. It has a far more relaxing vibe, and, while it also caters for convention business, it boasts a good range of facilities, notably its indoor pool and gym, plus four treatment rooms for massages and beauty services. The two restaurants feature gourmet French fare as well as international cuisine to ensure families don’t feel left out. \nFor more information, see: radissonblu.com/en/golfresort-paris Hotel L’Elysée Val d'Europe, Serris \nLooking for a hotel beyond the obvious ones closest to the parks might bring you to this smart little choice in the heart of Val D’Europe, which is just one stop from Marne-la-Vallée on the RER train line. While its main focus is couples, it still features some well-equipped family-style rooms in triple and two-double configuration. Its elegant restaurant offers Paris brasserie style but its real draw is being at the heart of this bustling modern town, which has fabulous shopping – including the designer outlets of La Vallée – and exquisite dining just a short walk from the front door. \nFor more information, see: hotelelysee.com/en", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T12:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T13:04:37.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
