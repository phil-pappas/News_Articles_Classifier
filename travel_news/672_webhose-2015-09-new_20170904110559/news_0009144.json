The report of a drowning came in just before 11 p.m. at the Extended Stay America hotel, 7465 High Cross Blvd., which is just north of Worthington off Rt. 23 and north of the Outerbelt. Police Sgt. Aaron Ward confirmed that a woman had been found dead in a bathtub in one of the hotel’s second-floor rooms. But it’s not yet clear whether she drowned or died some other way. Ward couldn’t say who found her or how long she’d been in the room. The victim’s name also hasn’t yet been released. An autopsy is expected to be performed by the Franklin County coroner’s office on Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T06:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T06:59:40.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
