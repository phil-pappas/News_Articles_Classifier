Greenlots is overseeing the installation, operation and maintenance of the charging stations.\nThis rollout marks a new era for Singapore , as it signals the commitment to expand open standards- based electric vehicle charging for public use in the city-state. It is also the largest collaboration between a leading real estate developer and a premium automobile manufacturer to install public EV charging infrastructure. This will bring the total number of Greenlots' public EV charging stations in Singapore to 47 in 31 locations.\n\"This installment marks a significant milestone for electric mobility in Singapore , as we lay a sustainable foundation for the sector to thrive. We are dedicated to accelerating EV adoption in the city-state and a robust charging network needs support from car companies and the real estate sector. We are pleased to be partnering with industry leaders as we bolster open standards- based public EV charging for Singapore ,\" said Mr. Lin Khoo , Senior Vice-President of Greenlots.\nOn the heels of the all-electric BMW i3 and BMW i8 plug-in hybrid sports car launched in Singapore , BMW Group Asia and Greenlots teamed up for the first phase of deployment to install public charging stations at five strategic CapitaLand locations in the CBD which are already operational today. The six operational charging stations at the CapitaLand properties are located at Capital Tower, CapitaGreen (two stations), One George Street , Raffles City Singapore and Six Battery Road. The second phase is currently being implemented at four of CapitaLand's shopping malls: Bedok Mall and The Atrium@Orchard, and The Star Vista and Westgate (two stations each).\nLeading the real estate industry in supporting sustainable mobility, CapitaLand will offer an extensive public EV charging network in Singapore with 12 charging stations across nine strategic locations. Out of the 31 public EV charging locations, CapitaLand properties make up nearly one-third of the entire island-wide network. This makes CapitaLand the developer with the largest network of public EV charging stations in Singapore . It is also the first and only developer in South-east Asia to introduce a network of charging stations for EVs and PHEVs that spans properties across the integrated development, shopping mall, serviced residence, office and residential sectors. The EV charging stations available at CapitaLand properties will be accessible to all owners of EVs by any manufacturer. EV owners simply have to register via the Greenlots mobile app in order to start using the public charging network.\nMr. Tan Seng Chai , Group Chief Corporate Officer, CapitaLand Limited and Chairman of the CapitaLand Sustainability Steering Committee, said, \"As a responsible developer, CapitaLand is committed to operating our buildings in a sustainable manner. We understand that the availability of charging stations is key to greater adoption of EVs, which helps reduce carbon emissions. As property owners, we therefore recognize the instrumental role we can play in helping to make charging infrastructure more accessible. CapitaLand is set to offer over 100 EV charging stations at more than 40 properties throughout Asia and Europe , across integrated, shopping mall, serviced residence, office and residential developments. This will form an integrated CapitaLand network of charging stations, where our customers who are EV owners can plug-in and charge their cars easily and seamlessly when they live, work and play at our properties.\"\nPublic Charging\nChargeNow, BMW i's public charging program, enables BMW i drivers with access to a network of public charging stations located in various office buildings, shopping malls, hotels, industrial parks and buildings in Singapore . Greenlots administers ChargeNow in Singapore and enables local BMW i customers to access its vast and expansive network of AC charging units by using the BMW i ChargeNow card and Greenlots mobile app. Real-time information about the availability and location of these stations is provided to BMW i drivers via the car's BMW Navigation system Professional to assist them in locating the nearest available charging point.\nAbout Greenlots\nGreenlots is a global provider of open standards-based technology solutions for electric vehicle (EV) networks and grid management.
