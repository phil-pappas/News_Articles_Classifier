And the sharing economy – whereby people capitalise on their underused assets, time and skills by renting them out – seems to be capturing the imagination. The PwC consultancy estimates that the UK sharing economy is now worth £500 million and could be £9 billion by 2025. The innovation charity Nesta reckons that 25 per cent of the UK population used the internet to share assets and/or resources in the past year. Here are some new ways to make money. 1. People get an average of £465 a year renting out their driveway through JustPark. If you live near an airport, railway station or stadium, that figure can be an impressive £3,000. 2. Householders can let rooms for people to work in through Vrumi. Some hosts are earning a daily average of £50. 3. House-swapping can typically save users in London £3,300 on their accommodation costs via LoveHomeSwap. 4. Join BorrowMyDoggy and rent out your pet so dog-lovers without their own pooch can walk yours while you are at work. 5. If your car spends more time on your drive than on the road, share it via EasyCar Club. You could make £1,800 a year. 6. BlaBlaCar matches those looking to hitch a ride with drivers wanting help with fuel costs for long journeys. Riders pay a set fee direct to the driver. 7. Rent out a spare field for events, such as weddings and parties, on Fieldlover. 8. Neighbours can share via Streetbank – everything from instruments and tools to handbags, sofa beds and skills. You must pay tax on any money you make from sharing above £4,250. If sharing your home, check your insurance cover. • Learn about smart meters and find out how you can save money and time to spend on the things you love.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T01:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T20:34:10.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
