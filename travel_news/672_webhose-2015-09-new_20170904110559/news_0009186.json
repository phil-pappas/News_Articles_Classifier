However, Friday 25 September marked a new milestone in the history of the Virgin brand and New York, as Virgin Hotels broke ground with the Lam Group on Virgin Hotels New York City. Located in the NOMAD neighbourhood at 1227 Broadway between 29th and 30th, the property will serve as the brand’s flagship hotel and deliver a one-of-a-kind hotel experience in one of Virgin’s most favourite destinations. \n“New York City isn’t just a destination for the Virgin airlines, but a place where some of the most successful Virgin brands have been incubated, where we’ve stunned crowds with stunts and where some of our most devoted fans live. It’s a very special city to the Virgin brand and I’m elated that Virgin Hotels will soon call it home,” said Sir Richard Branson, Founder of Virgin Group. To commemorate the groundbreaking and the history Virgin has in the Big Apple, Sir Richard joined Raul Leal, CEO of Virgin Hotels to bury a Virgin time capsule; a chest of mementos from Virgin company moments in New York. Some of the capsules contents included: Virgin Cola can, Wham Glam Thank You Ma’am CD from the Times Square Virgin Megastore, Virgin Atlantic onboard salt + pepper shakers, Virgin Hotels key cards, Virgin America headphones and JFK boarding pass, photos and more. The hotel is slated to open in 2018 with 463 Chambers plus multiple concept suites, a rooftop pool and multiple dining outlets including The Commons Club and a rooftop bar. The first and second floors will be occupied with high end shopping, while Virgin Hotels will populate the floors above. Virgin Hotels Chicago is now open and accepting reservations at www.virginhotels.com, with Nashville, New York and Dallas slated to open next. Virgin Hotels continues to explore properties in cities such as Boston, Los Angeles, Miami, Austin, Seattle, San Francisco, Washington DC, and London; locations where it is pursuing conversions and ground-up development.
