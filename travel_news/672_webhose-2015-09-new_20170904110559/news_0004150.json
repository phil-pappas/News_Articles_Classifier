That’s one reason the congregation at St. Thomas the Apostle Orthodox Church in Springfield, Missouri, continues to hold its annual Greek Festival. The event will be held Friday through Sunday, September 11-13, 2015. “It’s our way of inviting the community to share our enjoyment of authentic Greek cuisine, pastries and drinks, and a party atmosphere where we all share tables under tents and enjoy the music and dancing on the church parking lot,” said Parish Priest Father Andrew Moore. “Opa!”, the all-purpose exclamation of delight, can be heard numerous times during the Festival weekend hours, from 5 until 10 p.m. on Friday, noon until 10 p.m. on Saturday and noon until 3 p.m. on Sunday. There is no admission fee and plenty of free parking. The church is located at 4200 S. Holiday Ave., in southwest Springfield. The food tent will feature a menu of entrees that includes souvlaki (marinated meat on a stick) and gyros (grilled meat, tomatoes and onions wrapped in warm pit bread with tzatziki, a cucumber/yogurt sauce) plus side dishes, pastries, Greek coffee from the Coffee Ethic, Greek wine, and beer and the always-popular baklava sundae. Festival-goers are invited to join in the native dances of Greece—the sirto, hasapiko, kalamatiano and hasaposerviko—and enjoy the mesmerizing rhythms of traditional music from the mainland and the islands. There will be inflatables for the kids and Father Moore will give brief overviews of the Orthodox faith in the church sanctuary. Greek memorabilia will be for sale in the agora (marketplace).   call the Festival Hotline, 417-841-8586.
