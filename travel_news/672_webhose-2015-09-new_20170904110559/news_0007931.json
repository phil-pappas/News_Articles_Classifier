Shepherds Manor is one of four creameries featured at the Maryland Cheese Pavilion, an attraction new this year to the wine festival. \n\"I love getting out there and sharing my wares. We're very lucky to have this opportunity,\" said Colleen Histon, who co-owns Shepherds Manor with husband Michael. \"We hope the Maryland Cheese Pavilion will be successful and grow over time.\" Caption DYLAN SLAGLESTAFF PHOTO / Carroll County Times Colleen Histon pours sheep milk curds into molds, a process called hooping, while making a batch of Tomae at Shepherds Manor Creamery in New Windsor Tuesday, Sept. 15, 2015.
