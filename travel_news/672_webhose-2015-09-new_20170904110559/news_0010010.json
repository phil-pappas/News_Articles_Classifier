To finish the weekend by formally recognising our top achievers was just the icing on the cake,” Gazal says. \nThere were two new award categories this year, the first of which was the Dedication Award, celebrating ten years working in partnership with TravelManagers. This was awarded to Lisa Metzl, representative for North Avoca in New South Wales. \n“I have always loved travel – as a teenager I knew that this was what I wanted to do for a career. Now I have more than 20 years of experience, including ten fantastic years with TravelManagers, and I’m still loving it!” says Metzl. \nThe other new category was the Advocate Award, which recognizes at a local level the PTM who is judged by the Partnership team to be an outstanding advocate of the brand within the travel industry. This year, the award went to Mel Carter, representative for Scorseby, Victoria. \n\n“Mel is always professional and often out there promoting TravelManagers,” says Gazal. “She loves travel and she loves sharing her enthusiasm for the industry with others – she has even referred two new personal travel managers in the past year.” \nDuring the course of the evening, awards were handed out for top new personal travel manager, most improved personal travel manager and top personal travel manager (all of these were awarded both by state and overall). \n“Our awards ceremony is also an opportunity to celebrate those among the TravelManagers family who make an outstanding contribution to the company in other ways,” says Gazal. “Our National Partnership Office (NPO) selected Mel Whyte, representative for Devonport in Tasmania, to receive the Recognition Award, which is given to someone who always adheres to policy and procedure, engages with the business and other PTMs and is the all-round ‘Good Guy’”. \nIn return, the PTMs chose Jose Canas, Fares and Ticketing Manager, to receive the TravelManagers Support Award, which goes to someone in the NPO team who has gone ‘above and beyond’ in the past year. \nAccording to Gazal, one of the highlights of the annual conference is the opportunity for PTMs to spend time with their key industry partners. \n“Their contribution to the success of our business deserves to be recognised as well,” says Gazal. “This year, our PTMs awarded the Partner Supplier Award to Qantas Holidays.” \nAs the evening drew to its climax, awards were handed out for Best Customer Service (Karen Farley, representative for Thornlands, Queensland) and the Spirit Award (awarded to Nicole Edgar, representative for Narre Warren South, Victoria) which is given in recognition of any person either within or external to TravelManagers who has been fundamental to developing, maintaining and enhancing TravelManagers’ unique culture. \nThe Choice Award, voted for by PTMs to recognise a fellow PTM for willingness to help, professionalism, upholding the TravelManagers brand and developing the unique culture within the business, was awarded to Luke Vaughan, representative for Hawthorn East in Victoria. \n“Luke actually received the Choice Award in 2014 as well,” says Gazal. “He consistently goes above and beyond the call of duty, both for clients and colleagues, and that’s why he was back on the stage this year.” \nThe awards part of the Gala Dinner was concluded by celebrating the achievements of the top ten PTMs for 2015, followed by the Personal Travel Manager of Year award, which this year went to Rebecca Crosbie, representative for Cardigan, Victoria. \n“Rebecca has over 15 years’ experience in the travel industry and her passion for providing excellent, personal service to her clients has been the key to her success this year,” says Gazal. \n“In all, this weekend has served to illustrate the incredible wealth of talent that exists within TravelManagers. “ \nFor more information or to speak to someone confidentially about TravelManagers please contact Suzanne Laister on 1800 019 599.
