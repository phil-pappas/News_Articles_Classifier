The idea is to increase the usefulness of something you might throw away. When you look into it, it’s amazing how many humble household items have two or more uses. Here are just three examples of how, with just a bit of sideways thinking, you can reduce waste and save money too. Tasty tip: use vegetable pulp from the juicer to thicken soups and broths Photo: Alamy Pulp from your juicer can of course be composted, but did you know that it also adds nutrition to other foods you prepare? Vegetable pulp can be added to soups or both to thicken and increase the fibre content, while fruit pulp can be turned into delicious fruit leathers by spreading it out thinly on a tray and baking on a low heat. Beetroot and carrot pulp is delicious in homemade cakes and both vegetable and fruit pulp can be added to bread and muffin mixtures to add flavour and increase nutritional density. You can even turn it into tea by boiling fruit pulp with water, adding spices such as cinnamon or ginger, cooling, and then straining. Dry floor sweepers are great for picking up dust and debris around the home, especially if you have pets. But the heads soon get too dirty to use and the refills are expensive to buy. Instead, use a cheap pair of chenille socks, which can cost as little as a pound a pair from discount stores. Place one sock over the sweeper and you’re good to go – after you’re done, pop the sock in the washing machine so it’s ready to use again. Vinegar is fantastic when it comes to cleaning and can be safely used on most surfaces while costing a fraction of shop-bought products. Diluted to one part white vinegar and 10 parts water, it can be used to clean chopping boards and worktops, to give you streak-free windows and to clean and deodorise your fridge. A stronger solution will spot-clean carpet stains and you can clean your dishwasher by putting a cupful through a cycle. Use it neat on a sponge on shower curtains. And don’t worry, the vinegar smell quickly evaporates. The latest government statistics have the UK recycling rate of household waste at 43.9 per cent – the EU target is for the UK to recycle at least 50 per cent by 2020. UK households typically spend £120 a year on cleaning products such as detergents and cloths. You can reuse items from the home in the garden – egg boxes are great for chitting potatoes and instead of buying expensive biodegradable seed pots, toilet roll inners work ust as well. • Smart Energy GB is the national campaign for the smart meter roll-out.
