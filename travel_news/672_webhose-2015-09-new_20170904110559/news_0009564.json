The contemporary space has been sympathetically reconfigured to feature a state-of-the-art 80-inch Smart TV at its core, with the latest touch-screen functionality allowing delegates to create, design and enjoy interactive games mid-meeting. In addition, the Energy Zone includes a table football, Nintendo Wii, high stools and relaxed seating in front of double-height windows exposing views over the estate grounds to provide a light, bright and inspirational space to inject some fun into a full range of meetings and events. The Energy Zone also offers super-fast Wi-Fi and an ergonomic work space area and chairs, and a refreshment station with two coffee machines offering delegates a wide variety of rich and aromatic coffees, selection of teas, sodas, juices, freshly baked cakes, biscuits and pastries and a confectionary unit with an extensive collection of traditional sweet shop style pic-n-mix candy. The initiative forms just one element of an investment programme for the venue, which includes the refurbishment of a number of guestrooms and function spaces, adding innovative new technologies, upgrading equipment and improving soft furnishings, all of which have helped the venue achieve an AIM Accreditation from the Meetings Industry Association. Debbie Guy, General Manager at Fanhams Hall commented: “We are committed to providing an exceptional meetings and events product, and for us this means investing in new initiatives carefully designed to create an optimum environment for delegates to feel energised, inspired and productive.” The new investment will complement the venue’s 12 principle meeting spaces and further 12 breakout areas, 77 comfortable bedrooms, selection of group activities and The Pavilion restaurant to provide a complete meetings, events, conference, training and team-building solution, all set in acres of beautiful grounds including Japanese Gardens and a Queen Anne Garden.
