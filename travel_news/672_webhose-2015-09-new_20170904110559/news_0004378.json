Legoland Malaysia has recreated the world of Ninjago with a live puppet show, making it the first such Ninjago attraction in Legoland theme parks around the world. \nGraeme Haddon, the show director of Ninjago: The Realm Of Shadows, is no stranger to either the world of theme parks or puppetry, having worked on shows such as Walking With Dinosaurs and studied puppetry at Walt Disney World. \n“I love theme parks,” the Australian said. “I’ve been to every Disney theme park in the world, Knott’s Berry Farm, Six Flags and Luna Park in Sydney. I love all of them — I can’t pick a favourite, I can’t be specific like that. I like everything about theme parks, from the rides to the food.” \nQ: Ninjago: The Realm of Shadows borrows some of its style from Japanese puppetry form Bunraku. Have there been forms of puppetry around the world that have influenced your work? \nA: As Ningjago is based around the martial arts world, Bunraku—a Japanese traditional puppet form—is a natural choice. The puppeteers are dressed as ninjas to move the puppet characters and make them jump around. Once the show starts, you forget about the puppeteers. There are many forms of puppetry around the world. I’ve used marionettes and shadow puppets in some of my other works, too. You can mix them all up for a show. \nQ: You have also trained at The Jim Henson Company in New York. Could you tell us more about that? \nA: I was there for only three weeks. I was given a scholarship to study puppetry overseas and The Jim Henson Company is one of the biggest and most famous ones to go to learn puppetry. \nQ: What are some of your favourite places in Australia to experience some puppetry, arts and culture? \nA: I love anything at the Sydney Opera House. In my youth, there used to be this place called the Marionette Theatre (at the former Sailors Home in the Rocks area), which I love and wanted to work for. Unfortunately, it folded after I left college due to lack of funding. Over in Melbourne, there’s a little more life in the theatre scene. I still enjoy going to the older theatres such as the Princess Theatre where I first performed at 12, the Comedy Theatre and the Regent Theatre. \nQ: If you could design a theme park, what features would you have? \nA: Lots of puppet shows, more indoor rides with animatronics and puppets, night time parades and more fried chicken. ― Today More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T04:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T04:49:18.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
