Ad Feedback \nAmong the included staff services are a butler, maid, chef, and security. A little extra cash can get you firework displays, massage services, and access to a 173-foot yacht. \nOn your way outside, you'll find a portable movie screen, jet skis, snorkel equipment, and a heated freshwater pool with its own swim-up bar. There are also private jogging trails and a 44-foot picnic boat that sleeps two. \nLocated in the Bahamas' Exuma Cay islands, Musha Cay is a 150-acre luxurious private island that rents at AU$57,000 a night. The island is owned by world-famous illusionist David Copperfield, who reportedly paid AU$50 million for it in 2006. \nThere are five separate homes peppered around the property, which can accommodate up to 24 guests in total. \nThe listing describes the architectural style as English colonial with a tropical flair. High ceilings and mahogany wood terraces are common features. \nYou can't possibly be bored here, with access to paddle boards, jet skis, bikes, tennis courts, beach-side daybeds, and a 28-foot Nautilus Rib Catamaran all included. \nPlan a romantic evening and dine on the beach. \nSeagrape Cottage, located at the tip of Little Thatch Island, is a romantic getaway for two. You'll find it in the Virgin Islands' picturesque Peter Bay. \nThe villa, seen here on the left edge of the photo, is priced at AU$914 per night. There's a four-night minimum stay. \nThe one-bedroom, one-bathroom cottage has simple decorations and a terra cotta-tiled veranda. \nIn addition to the indoor kitchen, there's an extra outdoor cooking area equipped with a full-sized barbecue, grill, and cooktop. \nSpend your days kayaking, sailing, and lounging in the hammock. Afterwards, start the evening with dinner and wine on the dining deck. \nEco-friendly travellers will appreciate Florida's Melody Key, which recently installed a state-of-the-art solar power system. \nStarting at AU$1250 a night with a six-night minimum, the four-bedroom villa can sleep up to 10 people. Each suite comes with its own private balcony. \nWhip up a delicious meal in the gourmet kitchen, which has granite counter tops and stainless steel Viking appliances. An adjoining living room has gorgeous ocean views. \nYou can easily switch between swimming in the Atlantic Ocean and your heated pool. \nOther notable amenities include on-site massage services, a private dock, and a rooftop observation deck ideal for sunrises and sunsets. \nEast Sister Rock Island is another Florida Keys gem priced at AU$6500 a night. \nIt's only a three-minute boat ride from the Atlantic shore, but feel free to fly in via helicopter if you're feeling adventurous. Unfortunately, the helicopter is not included. \nThe Bahamian-style house sleeps six and has a 2000-square-foot covered veranda. \nEnjoy panoramic views of the Atlantic from your deck, boat or canoe. \nJust make sure you're back in time to enjoy the picturesque sunset. - BusinessInsider.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T04:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T11:46:07.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
