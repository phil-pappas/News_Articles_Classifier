The FAA alleges one of the flight attendants performed in-flight duties before she was subjected to a pre-employment drug test. \nAdditionally, the FAA alleges the company transferred another employee from a non safety sensitive position into the safety sensitive position of in flight supervisor, a flight attendant position, more than 180 days after she had taken a pre-employment drug test. Employers must administer a new pre employment drug test before transferring an employee into a safety-sensitive position if more than 180 days has elapsed since the previous test. The flight attendant performed in-flight duties on four occasions before being re-tested, the FAA alleges. \nThe FAA further alleges the airline failed to include one pilot and seven aviation screeners in its random drug and alcohol testing pool. The agency alleges the pilot flew for the carrier for seven months when he was not in the pool, and that the others performed aviation screening duties on one occasion when they were not in the pool. \nThe FAA discovered the alleged discrepancies during an inspection of the airline’s Antidrug and Alcohol Misuse Prevention Program. \nSun Country has 30 days from receiving the FAA’s enforcement letter to respond to the agency.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T00:33:47.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
