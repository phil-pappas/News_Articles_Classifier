Well, now the name of Happy Sandman’s Pottery studio makes a lot more sense. With the emphasis in visual arts often tilting towards painting and sculpture and a larger number of art galleries centrally located in downtown Charleston, a pottery and ceramics studio in Summerville is unusual. And Sandman’s art, created and built from clay up, is both utilitarian and elegant. Sandman moved to Summerville from Oklahoma about a year and half ago, but he grew up in a studio environment since he was about 5 years old and was able to hone his artistic skills through much of his childhood. “My dad is a potter as well,” Sandman says. “And he was able to start a ceramic art program at the school he was working at. That really gave me a full studio to play with my own development and my own style. So at 13, I started teaching night classes with my father. That really gave me the foundation for where I’m at today pottery-wise.” His studio acts as a both a workshop and a classroom, complete with pottery wheels, an on-site kiln, individual recipe ceramic glaze and, of course, lots of fresh clay waiting to be molded into something new and creative. Currently, Sandman’s creations are available for purchase direct from his website or online at his Etsy shop. But Sandman also offers beginner classes at his Summerville studio where participants can learn the basics of “hand-building” clay and “wheel-throwing.” Once they’re done, students leave the four-week night class with their own pottery. Pottery and ceramics are unique processes that require a combination of several different skills: vision, craftsmanship and a lot of patience. Creating form from formlessness isn’t always an easy path, but Sandman has the right temperament for it; polite and patient, he’s the type of individual who certainly makes a great teacher. “I’ve had many students over the years and I tell them the same thing every time: obviously, practice makes perfect,” Sandman says. “But when you’re doing pottery, it’s very easy to get frustrated when you fail at first. And I tell people, you will fail at first, but you’ll build (skills) as time goes on. And I can recognize when students are stepping in the right direction and they move pretty fast from there.” From the first steps of shaping the clay on the potter’s wheels through the more advanced techniques of glazing, Sandman’s work is imbued with the sort of attention to detail and beauty that can brighten your morning with a simple, colorful coffee mug or add elegance to your home with a rustic ceramic platter. Sandman’s offerings are as special as his name. Happy Sandman Pottery Studio is at 130 Hemphill Court, in Summerville. Beginner pottery classes are 7-9 p.m. Tuesdays and Thursday starting Tuesday through Oct. 8. Register at www.happysandman.com or call (405) 820-8562.
