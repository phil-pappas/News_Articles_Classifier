Trucker Buddy classrooms will receive grants totaling $6,000 to help them purchase supplies and equipment.\nIn January 2016 , twelve classrooms will be selected to receive $500 in grants for supplies, equipment and educational materials. As last year, the classrooms will be selected based on need, time in Trucker Buddy, testimonial by their driver and a compelling reasoning of how they will use the grant.\n\"We've been a long-time supporter of Trucker Buddy and continue to applaud the program for its commitment to improving educational environments for children,\" said Bev Mestelle , Vice President of Talent for PeopleNet.\n\"Trucker Buddy and all our members are so grateful for the continued support of PeopleNet and the school supply grant that began last year,\" said Randy Schwartzenburg , Executive Director of Trucker Buddy \"I received so many thank you notes from the teachers and classrooms who were issued the grants. iPads, computers, basic supplies, as well as valuable education opportunities for the teachers all became a reality because of the grant program supported by our partners at PeopleNet.\"\nFor more information about the School Supply Program, visit the Trucker Buddy International Website: http://www.truckerbuddy.org/schoolsupply2016.html\nTrucker Buddy International\nTrucker Buddy International, an independent, non-profit 501(c) (3) organization, often called the number one trucking image campaign in North America, has helped educate schoolchildren and introduce educators to the trucking industry. This gives them the world through the eyes of a professional truck driver. The Trucker Buddy program helps to educate and mentor schoolchildren via a pen pal relationship between professional truck drivers and children in grades K-8 as supervised by their teachers.\nAfter an extensive screening process, the professional truck drivers are matched with a class and as directed by the teacher, drivers share news about their travels with their class. Students write letters and send pictures to their drivers. Students' skills in reading, writing, geography, mathematics, social studies, and history are enhanced and learning is made fun.\nSince 1992, Trucker Buddy International has helped educate over a million schoolchildren and introduced them to caring, compassionate men and women, professional truck drivers. The on-going success of the program is due to driver volunteers, participating teachers and the contributions of sponsors. There is no cost to the drivers or teachers to participate in the program. The Trucker Buddy program is funded entirely by sponsorships and donations.
