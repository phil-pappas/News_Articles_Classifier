Tickets for the gala dinner and the conference are still available to purchase.\nCouncillor John Kellas, Convener of Perth and Kinross Council’s Enterprise and Infrastructure Committee, said: “These conferences are extremely beneficial to Perthshire and are attracted here thanks to the diverse strengths of this region, which make it a prime location for business tourism.\n“Not only does the local economy get a notable boost from the influx of visitors, but Perthshire’s rich heritage of food and drink producers will have the opportunity to meet influential buyers capable of driving investment into their businesses.\n“I am confident the UK Craft Distillers’ Conference will be a huge success and on behalf of Perth and Kinross Council we are delighted to have played a role in bringing it to fruition.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T19:17:44.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
