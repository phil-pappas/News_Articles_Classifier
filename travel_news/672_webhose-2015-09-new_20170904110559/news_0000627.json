Pete Burrell, the managing director of Exodus Travel said that if the trekkers need to wait any longer for the lift of the travel warning, it will be too late for this season and might have dreadful consequences in the country. He, in fact believes that sooner the lift in the ban, the sooner will be the recovery of the country.\nMost tour operators are running trips to Everest base camp and the will get back on its feet through tourism. However, it will be a difficult task if the travelers are prevented from getting insurance due to Foreign Office advice.\nTrekking means to be responsible to take care of one’s own self. Choices to go on any particular route are also a personal choice however it is advisable to take the guidance from those with local knowledge. Those who have travelled in Nepal are aware of the fact that landslides are always something that posed a risk and the infrastructure repair is still ongoing.\nThe Foreign Office’s advice, which addresses concerns relating to the monsoon season that is just about to end, is based on regular consultations with scientists. A spokesman said its advice remains the same.\nThe authority said that many mountain areas are still under the increased landslide risks during monsoon season following the recent earthquake. The situation on the ground in Nepal is constantly under surveillance and is taking into account expert scientific advice and will continue travel advice under close review.\n( Pic: Trekkers on a trail leading to Everest Base Camp in Nepal earlier this year )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:22:30.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
