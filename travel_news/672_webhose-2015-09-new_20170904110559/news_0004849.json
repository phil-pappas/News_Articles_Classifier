Wilson isn't sure the plan will fly.\n\"You always see aircraft manufacturers studying passenger experience amenities like a sleeping box,\" said Wilson, About.com's air travel expert. \"But getting from concept to reality is a long road and most times never gets past the paper stage.\n\"And there are these two questions: Will airline passengers actually pay for something like this, and could the airlines make money with it? If Airbus can answer these two questions, then we are much more likely to see it someday.\"\nWhether the patent proposal ever becomes a reality is anyone's guess, but Airbus did confirm one interesting detail in its application: It admitted that its coach seats \"can be found by the passengers to be uncomfortable, particularly on long-haul flights.\"", "external_links": ["http://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?PageNum=0&docid=20150266581&IDKey=F9C4E206F21D&HomeUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fappft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO2%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsearch-bool.html%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526co1%3DAND%2526d%3DPG01%2526s1%3D%252522sleeping%252Bbox%252522.TTL.%2526OS%3DTTL%2F%252522sleeping%252Bbox%252522%2526RS%3DTTL%2F%252522sleeping%252Bbox%252522", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-3253137/Cheap-dreams-Economy-Airbus-passengers-soon-travelling-SLEEP-PODS-kitted-televisions-reclining-pillows-CCTV.html"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T01:40:45.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
