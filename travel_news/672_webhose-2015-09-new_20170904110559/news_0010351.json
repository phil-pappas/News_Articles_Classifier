With determination and courage, and under daunting conditions, they transported equipment, fuel, goods and personnel to areas around the world when they were needed.\nDuring the Second World War alone, Merchant Navy ships made more than 25,000 voyages between North America and Britain , braving the dangers of enemy submarines and fierce storms on the waters of the Atlantic Ocean. That same period, from 1939 to 1945, saw the tragic loss of lives of more than 1,600 Merchant Navy personnel.\nEvery year, on September 3 , Canadians take a moment to reflect on the selflessness and bravery shown by members of our Merchant Navy.\nFor more information on the Merchant Navy, visit veterans.gc.ca\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.veterans.gc.ca/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=C5272&Transmission_Id=201509021655CANADANWWEB______C5272&DateId=20150902"], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T01:22:00.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
