When the shuttering of Gourmet , the 68-year-old food bible of a magazine, was announced in October 2009 (note: It was owned by the same company that owns Vogue.com), Reichl, its editor in chief and once The New York Times restaurant critic, suddenly found herself, at 61, untethered. No longer beholden to the mad bustle of the food world, she retreated, to the house in upstate New York that she shares with her husband, and to her own kitchen.\nIt was mostly there that Reichl cooked through the painful transition, channeling her blues into anchovy bread and spaghetti alla carbonara, pouring her anxiety into a rich chocolate cake (official name: “The Cake That Cures Everything”). She recorded what she was making on her website. She also spent her time tweeting folksy little haiku-like compositions about nature and cooking and eating that won her admirers and haters alike.\nAt some point, a friend suggested this disparate cache of material might make a good book. What emerged, several years later—she tells me she had to publish her novel, last year’s Delicious! , first—is Reichl’s first solo cookbook since : A Feastiary , which came out in 1972.\nI’m a non-cook, as I sheepishly admit to Reichl when we get on the phone, and not exactly in the habit of reading cookbooks cover to cover, or even at all. But My Kitchen Year is far more than just a manual on how to make Reichl’s favorite meals, dishes that for her were, quite literally, comfort food. It’s also at least half memoir, charting her emotional journey from fallen magazine editor to full-time writer (and home cook). And, frankly, even the recipes make for lovely reading, full of Reichl’s elemental wisdom. They almost made me want to take to the kitchen.\nIn the best way possible, My Kitchen Year is cozy, the reading equivalent of curling up next to a fire with a glass of red wine and perhaps the scent of bread in the oven wafting over. And that, Reichl tells me, is just fine. Her goal all along has been to make home cooking feel fun and relaxing and carefree and appealing, to battle the increasingly prevailing notion that the kitchen is a sterile arena for perfectionists or professionals. “I believe it’s what we were meant to do,” she says. “We cook, animals don’t. It’s part of what makes us human.” Tough to argue with that! Here, more from our conversation with Reichl about mourning Gourmet , writing for a living, and the restaurants that still lure her out of her kitchen. Plus, of course, her weekend plans.\nThe opening of your book describes the last days at Gourmet . I was at Domino when it folded, so it really resonated with me. You’re pretty removed from that world now.\nOh, boy, am I! Are there things you miss?\nThe thing I miss most is just magazine work. It’s the most wonderfully collaborative work. I would leave every meeting we had about an issue and think, I wonder what this issue is going to be like? You’d bat it around, and everyone would add to it, and it would get richer and richer. I miss that intellectual excitement of thinking: What interesting subjects can we cover? The way it would come together. I was surrounded by people who were so smart and, in each of their fields, so much smarter than I was. That gathering of ideas and momentum and energy—I really miss that.\nDo you have any outlet for that now?\nThis book is the only thing I’ve done that’s remotely like a magazine. When I envisioned this, I envisioned it as a little, tiny book of hours with no pictures in it. When Random House insisted we include photos, and [the photographer] Mikkel Vang came in, he did things that I never in a million years imagined. We’d contracted with him to do 20 food images a season. He was taking all these other pictures, going out in the woods, photographing me as I was cooking. It was totally his idea. And when the designer got it, it was a complicated design. There were so many elements graphically: There were the tweets, recipes, recipe ingredients, the diary part. Everybody kept giving her instruction. She couldn’t get it. I said, “Why don’t you just do what you want with it? Forget what we all said: What would you do?” She came back with this fantastic design. It reminded me how much I miss pulling on everybody else’s creativity.\nSo I’m not a cook. I can’t say I’ve ever read a cookbook. But I loved reading this anyhow. I even read the recipes, which I will probably never make. It’s comforting. I spent most of a Sunday with it and it was a wonderful, cozy feeling.\nThat was my hope. If I have one mission in life, it’s to get people back cooking again. And I feel like we in the media have a lot to answer for. I think we’ve made people feel like cooking is complicated. If you can’t cook at a chef level, you should just forget it. I really wanted this book to say, Forget about results-oriented cooking. Just enjoy it. If you make a meal that isn’t good, it’s a meal! There’s another one in a few hours! All of the arguments against sustainable food, which come down to “it’s elitist,” can be answered by people knowing how to cook.\nHow do you mean?\nI would love to buy a sustainably raised pig. I would love to buy a piece of pork that comes from a happy animal. But it costs 10 times what factory pork costs. Everyone uses that as an argument for why eating well is an elitist activity. But if you know how to cook, you know how to take a tiny piece of meat and stretch it to feed a big group of people. You know how to use rice and beans and grains, which are all inexpensive, to feed people. We are not going to have a sustainable food system until people really know how to cook and feed themselves in ways that are more difficult than just, “I’m going to have meat three times a day and it’s going to be the middle of every meal.”\nYou’ve put your thoughts about the demise of Gourmet into the world before, in interviews, on your blog. Did it make you feel more vulnerable to articulate those thoughts in print, in this book?\nYeah, it did feel different. I don’t think I’ve ever written a book that was this honest or that made me feel so vulnerable. It’s one thing to be in a room full of people as it’s happening and say, “Oh, I feel really terrible.” It’s another thing a few years later to look back. I think we shield ourselves in the moment. I’d had a day job my whole adult life, basically since I was 16. Suddenly, there I am adrift in the world, in my mid-60s, going, “Who am I if I don’t have a job?” I don’t think I was really aware of that until I started writing this book. There’s always this impulse to pull back and not show that piece of yourself. Cooking is my passion, but if it’s not yours—which it obviously isn’t—there’s [still] some value in saying, “Yes, you do get through this. Yes, it is not the end of your life. Yes, there is a way to reclaim yourself, no matter how bad you feel.” Follow your passion and refind the core of what’s important to you.\nObviously you take enormous joy in cooking. Do you take joy in writing?\nI hate it. I would rather clean toilets than write. But I love having written. That’s kind of the drug that keeps you going. You don’t get it every day.\nA long time ago, when you lived in Berkeley, California, you cooked for a living. Now it’s your passion. Is there a “don’t turn your passion into your day job” ethos there?\nTo be honest, I would like to say I’m a chef, that I cooked for a living. We had what was basically a hippie restaurant in Berkeley. It was a very successful restaurant. But we were a group of overeducated people who liked to cook. We said, “Let’s open a restaurant!” If you’re cooking as a chef, it’s like factory work. It’s not like cooking at home. You don’t do one dish from start to finish. I’ve never done that kind of cooking, and I wouldn’t want to. Restaurant cooking looks like hell to me: The hours are long, you’re on your feet, it’s hot, it’s hard on your body, and you have one little piece of it. You’re in an assembly line essentially.\nThere’s a lot in here about cooking instead of eating out. Are there any restaurants that are the equivalent of comfort food to you still?\nOh, of course. There are plenty of restaurants. Everybody has that, if you have the luxury, a place where they know you, you don’t even have to order, you’ve been there so many times. For most people it’s around their house. I used to say when I was a restaurant critic, never trust anybody on a restaurant less than five blocks from their house, because they’ve been there so often they’ve edited out everything that’s not good in the menu.\nWhat are your ultimate, let-your-hair-down places?\nIt’s not in my neighborhood, but I’ve been going to Chez Panisse almost since it opened, going to the café. If I were really depressed I might fly across the country and go. In New York my restaurant like that is Pearl Oyster Bar. Actually, when you say that to me, the first place that still comes into my head—and it sadly doesn’t exist anymore—was Honmura An in New York. It was this fantastic soba restaurant, on a second floor on Mercer Street just below Houston. Everything was perfect. You’d walk in and see Susan Sontag. We liked the pure simplicity of it.\nDo you re-create those recipes at home?\nNo. That kind of Japanese cooking, the soba was made with buckwheat, which has no gluten. It’s very, very hard to make really good soba. Their restaurant in Tokyo is fourth- or fifth-generation. They’ve been doing it for hundreds of years. It’s very simple food, but you really have to know how to do it. And I don’t.\nI guess you can always fly to Tokyo if you really need to.\nYes, exactly. And it wouldn’t be the same. I don’t think I ever went there that we didn’t see people we knew. When we lived in L.A. the restaurant we used to go to was Campanile, like every weekend, with my son. There was something wonderful about breakfast there; it just felt like home. But it’s not there anymore, either.\nAll the more reason to cook!\nExactly.\nI read somewhere that you’re working on a second novel. True?\nIt is. I’m working on a memoir of the Gourmet years, and I’m working on my next novel.\nThe writing of your first novel, Delicious! , which came out last year, enters the storyline of this book. You end with the notion that you’re really ready to commit to the novel. Why’d Delicious! come out before My Kitchen Year ?\nI really wanted to try my hand at fiction. I wanted to see if I could do it. The cookbook was kind of accidental. I felt I had to write this novel first. I sort of think every writer thinks at some point in their life they should write a novel. And this was my challenge: Can I do this? I’m not sure I can. My father was a book designer. In the house I grew up in, fiction really was the highest art, the highest calling. My parents thought my writing about food was silly. In some ways this was like, Okay, I’ve done this my whole life, now I’m going to see what I’m really made of. Can I do this?\nHow’d it feel?\nReally scary. And, you know, in the end really satisfying. In the end I felt like I looked up at the sky and said to my parents: There! I did it!\nI interviewed Bill Clegg , the agent whose novel just came out. He’s written these memoirs of his crack addiction, gritty memoirs, and he said there’s nothing that made him feel more vulnerable than publishing a novel, because it’s a world entirely of his own creation. I can imagine your novel felt that way.\nIt totally did. It didn’t help that the first review I got [by Dwight Garner in The New York Times ] was so vicious. I thought, Well, I’ve been writing reviews all my life, and that’s part of it, right? You put yourself out there, and people can attack you.\nBut the Times did publish another review that was really nice.\nYes, yes. And most of the reviews were really nice. But this was the first one, and it came out the day the book was published. It was just humiliating. It was humiliating in every way.\nI read somewhere that you’d like to invite Dwight Garner over for dinner. Do you still feel that way?\nYeah, I mean, I totally respect him. That’s the thing that’s so hard. If it’s someone you can dismiss it’s easy. But I think his reviews are fantastic.\nSo what’s the one cultural thing you’re planning to do this weekend?\nI just got back from Mexico City last night. I’ve been away for 10 days. I have three days before the book tour starts. On Monday everything explodes. Tomorrow morning I’m going to the farmers’ market. This is my one fall moment. By the time I get back it will be November. Markets will be over. I’m going to collect as much food as I can and leave food for my husband while I’m gone. I’m going to be in the kitchen cooking as much as I can. This is the cook’s time right now. We still have summer produce and fall produce. I’m so looking forward to just wandering around talking to people, making a bunch of soups, minestrones and some stews.\nSo that’s Saturday. On Sunday, we make a sort of pilgrimage every year to MASS MoCA, which is one of my favorite museums in the world. There’s a big [Francesco] Clemente show that I haven’t seen yet. It’s a beautiful drive. We’ll spend the day.\nAt the farmers’ market, is there an ingredient you’re particularly excited about?\nReally this time of year, there’s everything. The last of the peaches. The first of the great fall apples. Butternut squashes. There are all the peppers now, all these beautiful peppers. The first thing I’ll cook is shishitos. I’ll bring them home and sauté them up and we’ll eat them for lunch.\nAnd I’m going to get as much garlic as I can, and put it in a cold, dark space. If you put it in a cold, dark space it will probably last until February, which means you don’t have to buy that nasty imported garlic.\nWhere do you keep it?\nA basement is good, if you have an unheated basement. I have a little cabin that I write in. And I have a bottom [desk] drawer that I fill with garlic.\nWhat a great image!\n[laughs]\nThis interview has been condensed and edited.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T02:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T20:02:31.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
