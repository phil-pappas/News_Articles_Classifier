There are fewer people doing more work and longer hours. The only way they can work productively is if employers look after their health.\" According to Shaun Subel, the director of strategy at VitalityHealth, this clear association is borne out by its survey for Britain’s Healthiest Company . \"We found a very strong relationship between the culture of a company and its productivity,\" he says. \"And what's important is the employees' perception of the company culture, not what the employer says it is doing.\" Professor Cary Cooper, Lancaster University Management School To assess a company's ethos, employees were asked if, for example, they felt that their managers cared about health and well-being, whether there was training on staff health available, and whether referrals were available for employees with health problems. The survey then looked at productivity for each company, using a standard scale known as WPAI (work productivity and activity impairment), that looks at self-reported absence and self-reported presenteeism (where an employee is at their desk but not necessarily working productively). Using the information they were able to calculate loss of productivity as a percentage of the wage bill. \"The average cost of lost productivity for participants in Britain’s Healthiest Company was 7.85 per cent of the wage bill,\" Subel says. Companies with supportive cultures had the lowest productivity losses \"But we found companies with the most supportive cultures had the lowest productivity losses. In fact those with the strongest health and well-being cultures had a 45 per cent lower cost of lost productivity compared with those that had the worst cultures. \"Lost productivity for the most supportive companies measured 5.9 per cent of the wage bill, compared with 10.7 per cent for those with the worst ethos.\" According to Subel, there’s also a very clear relationship between culture and investment. \"The more a company invests in health provision and promotion, the healthier the employees perceive themselves to be and, in most cases, the healthier they are. The healthier they are, the more productive they are.\" According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, 131 million days were lost to sickness absence in the UK in 2013. The top three reasons for absence were back and neck pain (31 million days off), minor illnesses such as coughs and colds (27 million days), and stress, anxiety and depression (15 million days.) So perhaps it is little surprise to learn companies that focus on preventing these types of illnesses have scored so highly. Shaun Subel, director of strategy at VitalityHealth Take Johnson & Johnson, which offers ergonomic workstation assessments to help ensure employees are correctly positioned at their desks, thus minimising the risk of repetitive strain injury and injuries caused by poor posture. It also – like adidas (UK) and Microsoft – has on-site physiotherapy services that mean minor problems can be diagnosed and treated before they escalate into issues that can mean someone is signed off sick for weeks. And while you can’t stop workers picking up coughs and colds, encouraging healthy eating to boost immunity by offering free fruit, as Lindt, Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi Pasteur MSD do, is a start, as is offering flu vaccinations. When it comes to mental health, minimising work stress by having an environment in which stress can be managed, and issues such as anxiety freely discussed with management, is crucial. But beyond that, mental healthcare can take many forms. Johnson & Johnson offers access to massage therapists as part of its stress management programme, while Old Mutual offers counselling – whether the issue is work-related stress or personal, such as bereavement or relationship problems. Adidas, meanwhile, gives employees access to life coaches and specialists trained in CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy), a form of treatment that helps people change their thinking on certain subjects. Ultimately, if it’s good for the employee, it’s good for the business.
