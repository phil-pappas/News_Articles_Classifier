Requires iOS 7 or later.\n>> Cost : Free\n>> What it does : The app allows you to save your travel hot spots to a map or list. You can annotate them with your own pictures and comments, plan your route, share the location with friends and look up more info on your favorites’ websites.\n>> What’s hot : There are multiple ways to enter a point of interest. You can type it in yourself, look at places near you for real-time list making or use your smartphone’s camera to add a spot by using the address you find in a guidebook or magazine (it works best if you have the name and address in the window). I like that using the app can be a personal experience and not dependent on friends and a big social network.\n>> What’s not : Adding friends was confusing. I didn’t understand why I had to generate a code — which was good only for three days — to share the app and my lists with my husband, particularly because the app is free. All the text said was, “Hey! Add me on Mapstr: code number.” I’m looking forward to more features: I’m keeping my fingers crossed that sending a full list to a friend will be one of them.\n———\nJen Leo, ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-13T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T23:40:50.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
