The independent analysis of 2.25 million on-line consumer-generated reviews on TripAdvisor, ranked global luxury hotel brands for both consumer sentiment and consistency across the hotel portfolios. “We are honored to receive this distinction atop an elite group of companies that focus on customer service excellence” said Herve Humler, President and Chief Operations Officer, The Ritz-Carlton. “We are a customer-centric organization which has been built on the feedback our guests afford us. We appreciate the external recognition of our efforts and the continued support of The Ritz-Carlton from global travelers.”\n“The pole position for The Ritz-Carlton is testament to a truly remarkable level of consistency and proof positive of a deeply entrenched commitment to delighting guests wherever they operate. In the opinion of the paying guest, The Ritz-Carlton is without doubt the gold standard,” said Piers Schmidt, Founder, Luxury Branding. “This resounding win and by a sizeable margin, which is all the more significant because the jewel in Marriott International’s crown is one of the largest luxury operators in this study,” he continued.
