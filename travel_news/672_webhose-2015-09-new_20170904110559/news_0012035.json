Jones denied the franchise’s request for a preliminary injunction to prevent franchisees from having to abide by that faster timeline.\nJudge Jones had said the franchise association and franchisees hadn’t shown that the city intended to discriminate against them and that there was no credible evidence showing that the law would cause franchisees to close or reduce operations.\nIn seeking to overturn Jones’ decision, the franchise association pressed its point that the city’s minimum wage law violated the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution by discriminating against franchisees solely based on the franchisees’ affiliation with interstate commerce — i.e., the franchise network.\nGreg Narver, assistant Seattle city attorney, said the intent of the law was not o target franchisees but to “put more money into the pockets of workers.”\nThe purpose of putting franchisees on the same fast track as large employers, Narver said, was to identify businesses that had the resources to pay more sooner.\nThe law is structured as “if you can pay more sooner, you must,” he said. “This is about financial wherewithal.”\nThe oral arguments were peppered by questions from the judges ranging from whether franchisees indeed follow a different business model than small businesses to whether there was evidence that franchisers would be willing to give more resources to franchisees because of the law.\nNo date has been set for the panel to issue its decision.\nIf Jones’ decision is overturned and a preliminary injunction granted, it’s unclear what that would mean in terms of higher wages the franchisees have already paid to employees since the law went into effect in April.\n“I feel like we were able to get our arguments in well,” Narver said after the hearing.\nSteve Caldeira, president and CEO of the franchise association, said he felt confident about the case it made Tuesday. “But if we have to take this case all the way to the Supreme Court, we’ll do it,” he said.\nJanet I.
