The Leicestershire village club’s prize, along with a £5,000 donation, was to host a match against the star-studded PCA England Masters team. Led by Ashes-winning former England captain Michael Vaughan, the Masters, who raise money for the Professional Cricketers’ Association’s benevolent fund, boasted an array of ex-Test players including Simon Jones, Mark Ramprakash, Dean Headley, Matthew Hoggard and Alex Tudor. To see 750 or 800 people around this ground watching us play is something I’ll remember for the rest of my life Jon Dale, the Newtown Linford chairman who plays in the 1st XI, said: “It’s not every day you get the chance to play against a plethora of former England stars and the occasion will live long in the memory of our players, past and present. “To have won a competition of this magnitude and to now be able to say that we serve up the best cricket teas in the land is an extremely satisfying moment for all of us at the club.” Dale was quick to praise the hard-workers responsible for the award-winning tea. “This day wouldn’t have been possible without two or three people,” he said. “We owe a huge debt of gratitude to Sancha and (her daughter) India Hopkins, who have won us this competition and won us this day.” A proper brew: an array of ex-Test players took part in the event Volunteers such as Sancha, whose other daughter, Jadzia, 15, also helps out, keep cricket clubs going and ensure that they are at the heart of their communities. “We’re only a small village club and at times it’s difficult to make ends meet,” says Dale. “To see 750 or 800 people around this ground watching us play is something I’ll remember for the rest of my life.” Dale was also grateful to Yorkshire Tea for putting on the Great Cricket Tea Challenge and providing such a memorable day. “It’s great that they’ve ploughed a lot of resources into the competition,” he said. With so many famous names at the ground, the local community came out in force to support their team, enjoy the day and watch the Yorkshire Tea brass band. There were also opportunities for fans and youngsters to test the speed of their bowling and play a virtual reality interactive game against James Anderson, the England fast bowler. Little Urn, Yorkshire Tea’s mobile tea-serving van that has visited the Test venues this summer was at the ground to provide free brews to the crowds. The club raised £10,000 from a sporting auction – which included a bat signed by the entire 2015 England Ashes-winning team – gate receipts, a raffle and the huge number of teas that were prepared for spectators. The showpiece day had an end of-summer, festival feel as the sun shone, runs flowed, wickets fell and a magnificent tea was served. A proper cricket day indeed. Experts' Comments Beccie Deighton, assistant brand manager, Yorkshire Tea It was a great day. We’ve been involved in grassroots cricket for many years and the Great Cricket Tea Challenge is a big part of what we do. Everything we do at the Ashes – being the official brew of England Cricket – is brilliant, but coming to clubs such as Newtown Linford and celebrating the unsung heroes is just as important. This is exactly why we run this competition. Mike Gatting Newtown Linford are worthy winners of the Great Cricket Tea Challenge. And today, once again, they showed how much passion they have in their kitchen, and how much love and care and attention they show in what they do. The food has been absolutely fantastic. Michael Vaughan, Yorkshire Tea ambassador The pitch was great, the weather was perfect and, more importantly, the teas were just fantastic. I want to thank the ladies in the kitchen – Sancha and India – for all their efforts and for being worthy winners of the 2015 Great Cricket Tea Challenge. Yorkshire Tea has created this great concept around cricket teas and days like this take you back to why we all play the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T19:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T14:28:15.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
