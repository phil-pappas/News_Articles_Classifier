But teachers have warned hands-up should be just one element of a wider strategy to get pupils to engage in the classroom . Tom Bennett has suggested that teachers asking pupils to raise their hands if they want to answer a question should be back in fashion following the banning of the practice in some schools altogether . Mr Bennett told the Sunday Times that for the last decade “hands-up has been going out of fashion” because it is perceived as a way of encouraging “only certain children to answer questions in class”. But he added: “Teachers can use their common sense. They are perfectly at liberty to ask a child who does not have their hand up to answer. \"Quite frankly, if you have a teacher asking the same one boy in the class to always answer questions, that is a bigger problem even than using lollipop sticks.\" Reacting to his comments, Kim Knappett, president of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL), she told BBC Radio 4’ Today programme that raising hands is just one strategy to get children to answer questions in the classroom. Ms Knappett said: “Raising hands should be part of a variety of strategies that teachers use. I myself use the lollipop sticks with children’s name on so you can randomly pick out who is going to answer a question. I have the lollipop sticks and I pick them out randomly to see who is going to answer a question. “Otherwise I would name a child because I think they need to be drawn back in I sometimes would get the children to talk about answers in groups before I ask them to give that answer to the whole class because sometimes children don’t put their hands up because they don’t feel confident at speaking.” Other methods to get pupils to take part in answering questions in class include asking students to hold up answers on whiteboards or providing them with colour-coded cups to determine how well they have understood a lesson. Teachers say picking children at random to answer questions is a more representative sample, following suggestions that hands-up should return to UK classrooms Photo: PA Dylan William, emeritus professor of education assessment of the Institute of Education at London University, has been a champion of stopping children raising their hands. He told the programme: “It doesn’t really matter very much whether students raise their hands. What matters is if the teacher is only choosing the ones with the hands up with the answer to a question. “If they are, then they are only hearing from a small proportion of the class and they are making decisions about whether the class is ready to move on on the basis of bad evidence. “In our research we found teachers say we let the kids raise their hands anyway but we do choose at random, but they dont, they do seem to be drawn towards the students who are showing eagerness to share an answers.” Mr William had said in an interview five years ago: \"Only a quarter of pupils consistently put their hands up. They can't wait to take part, while others switch off completely.\" telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T17:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T00:20:44.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
