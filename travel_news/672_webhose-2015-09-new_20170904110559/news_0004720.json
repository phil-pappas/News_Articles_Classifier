The Bank’s monetary policy committee statement said an economic contraction was unlikely in the third quarter following a 1.3% decline in the second quarter.\nMoody’s on Wednesday expressed the same view as the governor, saying in a credit opinion note: “Despite weak indicators and depressed business confidence that continues to undermine investment prospects, we expect recession to be avoided this year,” Moody’s said.\nWith Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T18:29:01.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
