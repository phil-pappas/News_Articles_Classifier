It is now seeking views from the local community to help shape its final proposal before submitting to the Civil Aviation Authority for approval.\nAndrew Harrison, Stansted Airport’s Managing Director, said:\n“I would like to especially thank all those in the community who helped us shape this project, particularly members of our independent monitoring body, the Stansted Airport Consultative Committee and its environmental sub-group. It is by working together that we can achieve the best results, and we all look forward to hearing the feedback from the community about this innovative project which demonstrates significant and positive improvements for local residents around the airport.”\nKeith Artus, Chairman of the Environmental Issues Group (EIG) of the STACC, said\n“The EIG works in tandem with the airport on all environmental matters, which includes working on initiatives to improve the effects of aircraft noise on the communities that surround the airport. We feel the noise and environmental benefits from this project are considerable and urge our local communities to look at the achievements and facts provided in the consultation materials and make their responses accordingly.”\nSource:- Stansted Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T18:25:40.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
