Based in Mid-Wales, their expanding team has seen an influx of interest in travel in Wales both in the domestic and international markets which has prompted the need to offer a programme of set departure dates for Wales.\nThese tours will be fully escorted, with a maximum of 16 people per tour, travelling in luxury minicoaches and staying in great quality hotels throughout Wales. They will include a range of experiential tourist excursions and site visits, and will be available for operators to book individual customers on to.\nAberystwyth-based Cambria Tours has gone from strength to strength this year, working alongside Visit Wales on the promotion of Wales in many ways, including attending various international exhibitions and travel trade fairs such as ITB Berlin and Destination Britain Americas in Mexico. Their managing director Aled was shortlisted for ‘Rising Tourism Star’ at the National Tourism Awards for Wales 2015. They have experience in organising tours for FIT’s all the way through to multi-coach tours, with the largest group they have carried in the last year consisting of a group of 128 from all over America.\nAled Rees, managing director of Cambria Tours, said, “Promoting Wales as a key tourist destination is close to my heart, and integral to what I am doing with Cambria Tours, and we have seen the demand for Wales grow over the last couple of years. Through our conversations with a wide range of operators from overseas, we have spotted a gap in the market for Wales which is ready-made high quality tours that operators can feel confident in booking their customers on to. We endeavor to offer this in 2016 to encourage even more operators to offer our beautiful country as an important holiday destination, without the fear of being unable to fill their own coach for Wales.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T15:31:32.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
