In South Australia, sex work is criminalised. That is, it is a criminal offence to provide sexual services in any way, shape or form.\nIn states such as Queensland and Victoria, a model exists where sex workers and establishments are licensed and are required to abide by strict regulation regarding the conduct of business.\nIn New South Wales, influenced by the recommendations of the Wood Royal Commission, the industry has enjoyed the decriminalisation of sex work since 1996, a model which was only just endorsed by Amnesty International last month as the best way to preserve the human rights of those who are involved in the industry.\nAs a result of decriminalisation, New South Wales’ sex industry is considered to be one of the most advanced sex industries in the world. It is accepted by leading human rights organisations that decriminalisation in New South Wales has lead to decreased physical and sexual violence, decreased rates of arbitrary arrest and detention, better HIV testing and medical interventions and removal of restrictions on healthcare, housing and other social and legal benefits.\nIt is argued by those in support of licensing of the sex industry that new barriers, including police checks and payment of exorbitant fees, should be introduced for the entire industry.\nAmong those in support of such a scheme is the New South Wales Police Deputy Commissioner, Nick Kaldas.\nHe told the inquiry yesterday that “there are clearly issues in the industry, in terms of servitude, the use of illegal workers and extortion by or involvement of organised crime and outlaw motorcycle gang groups”.\nAccordingly, he was of the view that in response, the Select Committee should consider a recommendation that there should be a register of sex premises, including a list of sex workers as well as owners and managers, that the police can have access to.\nFirstly, the New South Wales Police and the Australian Federal Police have always had the ability to deal with issues such as servitude, illegal workers and extortion. Adding a new layer of licensing is not a logical choice in the stemming of such crimes, but rather a duplication of enforcement action which can already be taken through use of police powers with respect to criminal activity.\nThe expense of shifting a new licensing scheme and bureaucracy would also be a significant burden on the tax payer. Furthermore, similar licensing models in Victoria and Queensland have been a comprehensive failure.\nThere is a high level of noncompliance, with 50 per cent of Victorian sex workers still operating illegally as of 2012. In Queensland, only 24 brothels have ever been licensed in the 14 years that regulation has been in place.\nOf greater concern is the impact on the safety and welfare of sex workers.\nNot only are they exposed to councils who use the practice of obtaining evidence through private investigators deceiving them into providing sexual services, the idea of placing themselves on government-maintained, permanent “sex worker registers” is terrifying.\nIt interferes with the privacy of the sex worker, limits the sex worker’s ability to travel and affects the access that the sex worker has to services. Many sex workers, when approached about whether they would voluntarily place their names on a list like this, were horrified with the idea of having to do so.\nNon-compliance would be incredibly high. As such an entire population of workers would become ‘criminals’ overnight, simply for wanting to maintain a level of anonymity.\nThe message from various organisations, such as the Kirby Institute, UNSW, Touching Base, the AIDS Council, Family Planning, and Scarlet Alliance, the Australian Sex Workers Association, has been loud and clear.\nThe introduction of a licensing system would not only create a complex and ineffective bureaucracy, but it would place public health — and workers themselves — at risk.\nAs it has been stated by many leading academics in the area, “if it’s not broken, don’t fix it.”\nKathryn Adams is a lawyer specialising in human rights and sex work issues, as well as an advocate for the global decriminalisation of sex work.
