Americans cannot travel as ordinary tourists to Cuba under current U.S. regulations, but they may participate in certain types of trips, including people-to-people trips that foster cultural exchanges.\nThe trips will “focus on supporting cultural exchange and economic development for the Cuban people and include a variety of artistic, educational and humanitarian activities,” Carnival said Wednesday.\n The preliminary itinerary includes meetings with artists, entrepreneurs, schoolchildren and others in settings ranging from the Afro-Cuban community in Havana’s Muraleando neighborhood to an organic farm to colonial heritage sites.\nCarnival says the Cuba cruises will begin in May.\nAll trips offered by the Fathom brand will have a focus on volunteering in a destination. The brand is also selling service trips to the Dominican Republic.\nAssociated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T17:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:48:13.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
