Al Zorah Golf Club also becomes the first new championship venue in the UAE for nearly six years and will initially be opening its membership to a limited number of golfers.\n \n \nPromising to be a truly welcoming facility, Al Zorah Golf Club will certainly take the golfer’s breath away with its captivating 18-hole championship layout set amongst a spectacular naturally preserved environment of native sandy areas, lakes and one million square metres of mangroves. As Ajman’s first golf course and Nicklaus Design’s first solo project in the Middle East, Al Zorah Golf Club will feature pristinely manicured fairways and greens alongside an abundance of natural wildlife, 12 km of waterfront and a tidal system that alters the dynamics of the course on an hourly basis.\n \n \n“We’re very excited to open our memberships and look forward to welcoming our guests to what is a golfing paradise set amidst a stunning natural environment,” commented Philip Henderson, General Manager for Al Zorah Golf Club.\n \n \n“As shown in our brand new photography, the work the Nicklaus Design team has done on maintaining the natural beauty of the land and making it part of the course’s personality has been remarkable,” continued Henderson. “The end result is a world-class golf course set in an extremely refined and eco-friendly environment.\n \n \n“As well as the golf course and its spectacular surroundings, visitors to Al Zorah Golf Club will be welcomed with impeccable service and hospitality thanks to the partnership with the famous Troon Golf company. The product will provide the perfect fit for the modern golfer who demands quality, a welcoming atmosphere and ultimately good value for money.”\n \n \n“Al Zorah Golf Club is an absolutely breathtaking setting for golf and we’re delighted to have been chosen to manage the newest and arguably one of the most distinctive courses in the Middle East,” noted Bruce Glasco, Chief Operating Officer, Managing Director, Troon International Division. “Troon Golf has a proven track record of delivering world-class service for golfers at top courses in the Middle East and we now look forward to helping Al Zorah Golf Club become one of the most talked about courses in the region.”\n \n \nIn addition to the par-72 course, the Al Zorah Golf Club will offer members and visitors a welcoming and magnificently-structured Pavillion clubhouse, as well as a Shakespeare and Co. restaurant, with plans also in place for more off-course attractions in the coming years.\n \n \nSignificantly, the Al Zorah Golf Club site has been designated a Free Hold Zone by the Government of Ajman, meaning the land is not only legal to build on, but also to live on too. Constructed in conjunction with real estate developer and property manager Solidere International (SI), there are 42 Al Zorah Golf Villas as part of an initial development, offering a more relaxed way of living amongst natural landscapes and wildlife.\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T18:27:06.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
