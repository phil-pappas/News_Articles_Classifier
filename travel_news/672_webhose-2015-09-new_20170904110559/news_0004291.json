In March this year half of private cars, motor-bikes and almost all trucks were prohibited from running on the roads of the capital and its inner suburbs if the vehicles were even numbers as part of a fight against acute pollution. \nThe scheme was supposed to run for two days, with the odd-numbered vehicles being banned from the roads the following day, but this was scrapped by the French Government after the success experienced in lowering air pollution levels on the first day. \nIn the same week Paris and much of Northern France had been swathed in thick smog that covered landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe, while emergency measures such as stopping rubbish burning and lowering speed limits were put in place to tackle the dangerous levels of pollution", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T21:33:47.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
