MOSCOW — President Vladimir Putin has received the right to deploy armed forces in Syria, two days after the Russian leader discussed ways to co-operate on fighting Islamic State and other terrorist groups in the Middle Eastern country with his US counterpart, Barack Obama.\nLegislators in the upper house of parliament unanimously approved Putin’s request to deploy troops in Syria, Kremlin chief of staff Sergei Ivanov said on Wednesday in comments broadcast on state television.\nRussia would send only air forces, not ground troops, and the mission would be for a limited period of time, Mr Ivanov said.\nIn recent weeks, Russia has deployed more than two dozen fighter aircraft and troops to an air base in Syria, according to US officials.\nMr Putin’s administration drafted a request last month for the senate to approve the deployment of 2,000 air personnel to Syria though it didn’t submit it immediately, according to two people familiar with the matter.\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:23:31.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
