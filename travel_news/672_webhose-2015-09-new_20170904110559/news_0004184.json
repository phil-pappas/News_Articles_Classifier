Tears before bread-time Star Bakers often have a tough time the week after their win and so it proved with Nadiya Hussain . Making a second batch of pastry for her showstopper vol-au-vents proved her undoing, as she ran out of time and was forced to serve them, ahem, “deconstructed”. Tears flowed but luckily, the judges loved her “scrumptious”, “stunning” fillings and Nadiya deservedly survived. Phew. We’ll get to enjoy her expressive face-pulling for one more week at least. 2. Alvin had no stardust Tear-prone Alvin Magallanes has looked vulnerable for a while now and a stinker of a week sealed his fate. His signature bake was undercooked, he came second bottom in the technical round and his showstopper vol-au-vents were raw in the middle. The elimination was a foregone conclusion. Farewell, Alvin. It’s literally been emotional. Half-baked: Alvin was eliminated in Pastry Week Photo: BBC 3. Pie in the sky The historical feature returned after a week’s break, with presenter Sue Perkins telling the enjoyably eccentric tale of West Yorkshire village Denby Dale’s tradition of giant pies. They got stuck in ovens, had to be buried in case they poisoned people and one baker nearly drowned after falling into his own pie. It made you proud to be British. 4. Fireman Mat finally comes good He’s often looked doomed but likeable Mat Riley’s Star Baker accolade was well-earned after he won the technical round and produced “gorgeous” his ’n’ hers vol-au-vents. They looked a lot more appetising than Ian’s ungarnished black squid ink ones. Imagine those being passed around at Abigail’s party . All smiles: likeable Mat is going from strength to strength Photo: BBC 5. Flora’s still the nearly girl… Her respectable Cypriot flaounas saw Flora Shedden continue her remarkable consistency in the technical challenges, finishing runner-up for the third time in six weeks - on top of her pair of third places. When she finally wins one, the 19-year-old Scot might explode with relief. 6. …But she needs to keep it simple Flora’s extra flourishes are beginning to annoy Mary Berry, who insisted that the amaretti biscuits around her frangipane “didn’t add anything”, approved when her vol-au-vents “didn’t have extra things stuck on the side” and also added: “Flora’s ideas are there but she’s got to do what we ask.” Golden Bake-Off rule: don’t rile La Berry if you want to survive in the marquee. 7. Ian’s a chip off the old block There’s something Good Life-ish about baker Ian Cumming, with his home-made moulds and home-grown ingredients. This week, he was aglow with pride about baking with eggs laid by his own guinea fowl (come on, we’ve all got them). It clearly runs in the family - as revealed by Jo Brand on last week’s Extra Slice, Ian’s father keeps bees and is “swarm co-ordinator” for his part of Hampshire. 8. Soggy bottoms are back It took until the halfway point in the series but finally, that familiar Bake-Off refrain rang out around the marquee. The culprit? Nadiya’s frangipane tart. Careful, we might set her off blubbing again.
