In May, the US Department of Justice announced charges against five marketing executives for their role in the alleged bribery scandal. Swiss authorities have also joined the investigation which is looking into the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids. \nMr Blatter, who will remain Fifa president until an election is held next year, has not been accused of any wrongdoing. While Mr Blatter has insisted that he is “clean” and “an honest man”, he has also said he will not “risk” travelling to any countries with an extradition treaty with the US while the investigation continues. \nMr Valcke has not been accused of any wrongdoing. He surfaced in the criminal charging documents in a discreet reference to a $10m payment made to South Africa from Fifa’s coffers. \nThis year Mr Valcke confirmed that he signed off on the payment made to an account prosecutors allege was controlled by Jack Warner, a former Fifa vice-president accused by the US of taking bribes. \nAt the time, Mr Valcke said: “I am signing contracts every day . . . everything has the signature of the secretary-general.” \nThe Guardian newspaper reported on Thursday that documents it had seen suggested Mr Valcke was to benefit from an agreement to sell World Cup tickets at inflated prices. The newspaper also said the documents were incomplete and could be interpreted differently. The Guardian said Mr Valcke had denied the allegations. \nIn response to the suspension, Fifa’s independent ethics committee said late on Thursday that “it will analyse all information that is brought to its attention of its own accord. The question of whether an investigation is pending in a specific case, will not be commented upon.” \nMr Valcke could not be reached for comment.
