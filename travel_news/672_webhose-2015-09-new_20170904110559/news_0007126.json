Royle came to Daytona with a brand new 2015 Civic Si, after qualifying for the Runoffs with a 2013 model, and put the new car on the pole before leading from flag-to-flag for a 5.663-second victory. Michael Tsay brought his Honda Civic Si home third for a 1-3 Honda finish.\n\"The car is brand new. It had only seven miles on it when I got it in August to replace my previous Civic, and we began to turn it into a race car,\" Royle said. \"Now, with a national championship, it has about 225 miles on it! Meanwhile, Mike's [Tsay] car, which is a 2012 Civic, has thousands of racing miles on it, yet we ran the full 14 laps together. That's the beauty of this class.\"\nTsay avoided an opening-lap skirmish in Turn 1 to improve from sixth on the grid for his third-place finish. \"We were three across at the start,\" Tsay said. \"I got bumped in the rear in Turn 1, the tail slid out and I thought I was done, but I just kept my foot in it and merged back into traffic. It was a tough run trying to catch up with Lance [Stewart, who finished second], but he had just a little bit more.\"\nSuper Touring Light\nHonda Civics also dominated the popular Super Touring Light class race on Saturday, claiming the top four finishing positions and five of the top seven in a large, 37-car starting field.\nA last-lap pass to reclaim the lead gave Kevin Boehm his first SCCA National Championship in dramatic fashion around the 3.56-mile Daytona road course. Boehm edged the Acura Integra GS-R of defending class champion Cliff Ira, while Deuce Keane II led a pack of three for third in his Honda Civic Si. Darin Treakle rounded out the top four finishers, just a tenth of a second back in his Civic.\nBoehm led most of the 14-lap contest, but saw his advantage evaporate with two to go when Ira closed the gap on the banking and drafted around Boehm for the lead. But a missed shift by Ira exiting the \"Bus Stop\" chicane on the final lap gave Boehm the opening he needed to complete his own pass on the banking and claim the title.\n\"It was pretty clear that Cliff had a great car and that he was going to catch me, so I started to plan in my mind what I was going to do when he got to me,\" Boehm recounted. \"In the end, with a little bit of luck, it worked out. The last two laps, it seemed I was a little better under the brakes, so I tried to use that to my advantage. It seemed I was getting a little better run through the Bus Stop, so my last-ditch effort was to not lead the last lap and try to be close enough to use his draft. Luckily, I didn't have to do that. I hate it for Cliff that I have to win that way, but I'll take it for sure.\"\nFormula F\nFourteen drivers in the 25-car Formula F field utilized the HPD L15A7 engine at Daytona, and Rick Payne came from 10 th on the starting grid to draft his way to Honda's fourth consecutive victory in the highly competitive class on Sunday, in one of the most exciting race finishes of the weekend.\nPayne made a great race start in his Van Diemen RF99 Honda, gaining three positions in the run to the first turn. He then steered clear of two incidents that eliminated four of the top 12 starters in the race's first five laps, moving him to fourth and in contention for the win.\n\"Starts have always been my thing,\" Payne said. \"I love them. I don't know how I ended up 10th on the grid. We didn't feel like a 10 th -place car going in, I know that sounds a little cocky, but that's a fact. We did not feel like we had a 10 th -place car, so I just kind of made a bit of a move at the start. A couple of guys touched wheels, but I got through and sort of set myself up to run with the leaders.\"\nWhen race leader Tim Kautz brushed the wall while heading into the Bus Stop chicane while leading on Lap 13, Bill Valet took the lead and was closely followed by Jason Generotti and Payne. On the 14 th and final lap, Payne drafted by both Generotti and Valet in one major move entering the Bus Stop, then held them off in the final run through Turns 3 and 4 of Daytona's NASCAR oval for a narrow .110 of a second victory.\nIn addition to the races highlighted above, Honda Racing/HPD drivers also emerged victorious in the races for Super Touring Under, GT-3 and GT-Lites; and F and H Production. Honda drivers also finished second and third in B-Spec; second in Prototype 1; and third in Formula Atlantic.
