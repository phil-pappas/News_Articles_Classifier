It’s what German Chancellor Angela Merkel has described as a greater problem than Greece and the “next major project” for countries to take action on. \nNow, the very foundations of the 28-member bloc could be under review with critics calling for a review of the Schengen Agreement — a passport-free zone that allows unrestricted travel for members of 22 of the EU’s 28 member countries, plus Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein, which are not in the union. \nThe International Organisation for Migration’s Brussels communications manager Ryan Schroder told news.com.au the prospect poses a major existential problem for the European Union. \n“It’s very much a question of the future of the European Union. It really goes to the heart of European values of humanity and solidarity. The migration question is putting all of these to the test,” he said.

Source: Getty Images \nThis week Chancellor Merkel said the future of the passport-free zone was under threat if a common policy on asylum seekers could not be agreed. \nThe Schengen area — created in 1995 and named after the village in which it was signed — has been an economic boon for the region, allowing millions of people to work and travel freely while cutting red tape. \nHowever it’s also created problems as the lack of a common asylum seeker policy means there are imbalances between member states. Chancellor Merkel said EU states must settle their differences on how to distribute migrants arriving in Italy, Greece and Hungary. \n“If we don’t arrive at a fair distribution then the issue of Schengen will arise — we do not want that,” she said. \nThe comments come as Hungary completes a four metre high wall of barbed wire and sealed its train station to prevent asylum seekers moving across the EU. In France, the Eurostar was forced to turn back and passengers trapped for hours after would-be migrants were found clinging to the roof. \nGreece has appealed for an “immediate” response from European leaders while in Turkey, haunting images of a young boy washed up dead on a beach have highlighted the desperation of those seeking a new life. Stranded Eurostar passengers were forced to wait on the train for hours due to people on the track.

While some have shown solidarity new arrivals, lending food and clothing, it has also led to the rise of far-right political parties and even arson attacks on places used to shelter new arrivals. \nThe European Commission will hold an emergency summit on the issue at the end of next week but so far has refused to condemn the right of countries to protect their borders. \nCommission spokeswoman Natasha Bertaud said Schengen states were allowed to introduce border checks after a security threat — raising the question of whether migrants can be deemed to be that. She also acknowledged that “you can never rule out the possibility of future changes being necessary”. \nFor Mr Schroeder, the number of refugees and migrants arriving in Europe is well below critical levels. \n“We feel Europe could absorb much greater amounts but this will depend more on member states coming together and acting more as a union,” he said, adding that any reinstatement of border checks would be a nightmare for members. \n“It’s going to be a huge headache because people in Europe and Europeans have grown so accustomed to borderless travel. To have that reversed would be quite a shock to the system.” \nWhat do you think Europe should do in response to the migrant situation?
