Compulsive leg-shaking – The fidgety leg-shaker isn't all that common, but still annoying when encountered at altitude. Hide Caption 4 of 21 21 photos: 20 rudest things people do on planes 17. Boarding ahead of group number – Most airlines have a system for getting hundreds of passengers aboard in the least amount of time. That's why we schlep on as part of Group A or B or C.

Hide Caption 7 of 21 21 photos: 20 rudest things people do on planes 14. Yacking on cell phone – \"Hey, we just landed. ... can you hear me? ... we just landed ... I'm on the runway ... can you hear me now? ... We just landed ... \" Hide Caption 8 of 21 21 photos: 20 rudest things people do on planes 13. Bringing aboard stinky food – We get it -- airlines have cut back on food service, forcing us all to bring our own snacks and meals onboard. But did you really have to clean out the back of your refrigerator? Hide Caption 21 photos: 20 rudest things people do on planes 12. Loud talking – \"Hey, we're trying to read here!\" Hide Caption 21 photos: 20 rudest things people do on planes 11. Establishing armrest hegemony – No one wins when elbow wars begin.

Til the guy next to you lays claim to the no man's land of the middle seat with a book, coat or inflatable neck support. Hide Caption 12 of 21 21 photos: 20 rudest things people do on planes 9. Coughing, sneezing, germ sharing – Thanks for sharing your globules of diseased saliva. Not you, of course. Or this considerate (paranoid?) gent.

Baring feet – Appalling side note: people who actually go to the bathroom on the airplane in their bare feet. Hide Caption 18 of 21 21 photos: 20 rudest things people do on planes 3. Hogging toilets – We've all encountered the toilet hogger. What are they doing in there, you wonder as you hover cross-legged by the door. Certainly not being considerate of others.
