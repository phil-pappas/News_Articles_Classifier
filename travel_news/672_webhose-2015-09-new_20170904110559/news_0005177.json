The Virgin Atlantic/Delta joint venture joins other airlines with a firm commitment to the TMC community including British Airways, American Airlines, easyJet, Royal Brunei, Etihad and Vietnam Airlines. \nPaul Wait, Chief Executive of the GTMC commented: “We are thrilled to have the Virgin Atlantic/Delta joint venture join as industry partners. It is a critical time for airlines and TMCs in the business travel sector with some airlines not valuing the crucial role that TMCs perform in the selling, servicing and distribution of airlines’ products and services. Those airline partners within the GTMC, the voice of business travel, are making a clear statement and commitment in support of the GTMC members and third party distribution.” Chris Goring, Head of TMC and SME sales at Virgin Atlantic added: “It’s key that we recognise the important role that TMCs play in our business and we look forward to working closely with the GTMC. By working with such a respected business travel organisation, we’re confident that this is the beginning of what will be an extremely fruitful partnership between our joint venture, the GTMC and its members.” Rob Wilkinson, Delta’s General Manager for Global Corporates and Agencies EMEA added: “We are pleased to be working with GTMC in conjunction with Virgin Atlantic, as this relationship will enable us to continue to raise awareness of the Delta / Virgin joint venture as well as strengthen Delta’s brand in the U.K. as we work with the TMCs on growing our network.” The Virgin Atlantic and Delta partnership launched in January 2014, created a trans-Atlantic route network that offers customers up to 39 flights a day from the UK to 15 nonstop destinations in the United States. This network offers customers connecting in the United States seamless access to over 200 destinations across almost 600 routes. The GTMC is the UK's leading professional body for travel management companies. The diverse membership accounts for over 80% of UK expenditure on managed business travel, delivering value for money and great service to business travellers in the private, public and not-for-profit sectors.
