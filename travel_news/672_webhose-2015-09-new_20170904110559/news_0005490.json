This does not include the more than 75,000 new diesel engine specialists BLS anticipates the country needing by 2022.\n\"Trucking moves America forward and technicians keeps those trucks moving,\" said Carl Kirk , ATA vice president of maintenance, information technology & logistics and executive director of ATA's Technology and Maintenance Council. \"We're encouraged that ATA, as the industry leader, is urging people who can make a difference to focus on ways to address the looming technician shortage.\"\n\"ATA hopes that TMC's efforts, including events like TMCSuperTech and TMCFutureTech competitions, can highlight professional excellence and serve as a recruiting tool to bring more qualified individuals into this important career,\" Graves said.\nTo learn more about TMC, technician issues and TMCSuperTech and TMCFutureTech, visit: tmc.trucking.org .\nAmerican Trucking Associations is the largest national trade association for the trucking industry.
