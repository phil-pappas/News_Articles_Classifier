Picture: THE SOWETAN Related articles ANC denies involvement in Hitachi, Chancellor House transaction Hitachi fined in US for paying ANC ‘front’ In this article JSE-listed companies: Anglo American Platinum Companies and organisations: Democratic Alliance | African National Congress People: Zweli Mkhize PROMINENT business leader Valli Moosa, who was at the centre of the Hitachi-Chancellor House controversy when the transaction took place, says transparency in party political funding should be made obligatory to fight corruption.\nMr Moosa was chairman of Eskom as well as a member of the African National Congress (ANC) national executive’s finance committee, which fund-raised and oversaw the ANC’s finances at the time that ANC front company Chancellor House bought a stake in Hitachi Power Africa for a mere R1.25m.\nHitachi Power Africa went on to win contracts from Eskom, valued at R38bn at the time, while Chancellor House received $5m in \"dividends\" and a $1m \"success fee\".\nMr Moosa, who is now chairman of Anglo American Platinum, said on Tuesday that \"Hitachi Power Africa had no influence on the procurement process at Eskom\", but whether \"they thought they were buying influence is another matter\".\nThe US Securities Exchange Commission on Monday claimed that the $1m \"success fee\" paid to Chancellor House was in return for the company using its influence to win Eskom contracts.\nMr Moosa said that the important issue now \"is regulating the funding of political parties. There has to be a louder call for transparency. There is no reason why all SA political parties should not be transparent about all the monies they receive. This is the unfinished business of the constitution-making process.\"\nSection 236 of the Constitution states that \"national legislation must provide for the funding of political parties in national and provincial legislatures on an equitable and proportional basis\".\nHowever, the Constitution stops short of saying that there must be transparency.\nTransparency lobby group My Vote Counts in February applied to the Constitutional Court for a judgment on the matter. It argued that the right to vote was meaningless unless it was an informed vote and that the spending of public money must be transparent.\nParliament should be compelled to pass regulatory legislation on funding.\nThe judgment is expected on Wednesday.\nWhile the ANC has since 2007 resolved to introduce regulation, little has been done. In a statement on Tuesday, ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize repeated that \"the ANC is currently engaged in discussions to regulate party funding flowing from the state and the public sector\".\n\"The ANC categorically states that the organisation was not involved, implicated nor approached to answer on anything relating to the charges brought against Hitachi. The ANC was not involved in the transaction between Hitachi and Chancellor House nor do we have any information on any impropriety relating to the award of the Medupi or Kusile contracts to Hitachi. The ANC therefore cannot comment on matters internal to the two parties,\" he said. While the ANC urged journalists to contact Chancellor House for comment, its MD Mamatho Netsianda refused to talk to Business Day on Tuesday.\nThe Democratic Alliance (DA) has consistently opposed transparency on the grounds that its donors need anonymity to avoid being penalised on government contracts and business.\nBoth the DA and Helen Suzman Foundation said that they would approach the public protector to probe the transaction. DA leader Mmusi Maimane said it would lay charges against Chancellor House under the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act, which criminalises both parties to a bribe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:32:28.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
