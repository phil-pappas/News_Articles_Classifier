The Complaint seeks nationwide class action status to represent the approximate 500,000 U.S. citizens and families who are believed to have been defrauded by Volkswagen Group of America, and its parent company Volkswagen AG. Mr. and Mrs. Hellweg purchased new their Volkswagen Jetta SportWagen TDI in April of 2011. They were very interested in being environmentally conscious and are extraordinarily frustrated over the fraud that has been committed. Todd A. Smith, Carolyn Daley Scott and Brian LaCien are the lawyers involved from Power Rogers & Smith in pursuing this matter.\nSmith is the co-lead counsel for the economic loss class action pending in the Southern District of Florida ( Miami ) related to the explosive Takata Airbags that resulted in a recall of approximately 25 million vehicles. \"The Hellwegs, as conscientious citizens, sought a vehicle that provided the best possible diminishment of pollutants from a vehicle. They thought they had that in the Volkswagen SportWagen vehicle. It is now obvious that they did not.\" \"As a result of the fraud by Volkswagen, they have requested us to pursue this matter, not only for themselves, but for other similarly situated Americans,\" said Smith.\nThe Complaint describes the \"defeat device\" that Volkswagen intentionally designed into the software of the turbo seal vehicles. They claimed to be \"clean diesel engines.\" The device was used to deceive the EPA's emissions testing. Volkswagen's leadership admitted late last week the fraud that has been committed.\nThe deceit that is seen here has similarities to the ongoing case related to Takata Airbags. It is contended in the Takata case, where Power Rogers & Smith have leadership, that Takata and various vehicle manufacturers, were well aware of the issue for a number of years before it was finally admitted to the public recently.\nIf there is an interest in discussing this matter, and/or receiving a copy of the Complaint, please contact Todd A. Smith at 312 236-9381.
