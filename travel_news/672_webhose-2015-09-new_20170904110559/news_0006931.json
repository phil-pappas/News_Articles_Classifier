Broadly, the routes we are interested in are: 1. Lower Dolpo ( Juphal - Lingdo - Do Tarap - Numa La - Baga La - Ringmo - Juphal ) (approx 8-9 days) 2. Ringmo/Phoksundo lake - Rara lake - Darchula (approx 20 days) (1) needs a restricted area permit which needs to be applied via a trek agency. Typically one has to hire guide/porters from the agency in order to get permits. The route requires camping. (2) The route is the GHT lower route with basic guest houses in all villages along the trail. Start date: 1 October Entry and Exit points: will be determined once the route is finalized At present we are a team of two, and looking for one or two more people to join us.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T21:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T03:18:41.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
