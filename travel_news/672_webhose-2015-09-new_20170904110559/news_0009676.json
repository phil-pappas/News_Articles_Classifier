Airport officials forecast a record-breaking 835,500 travelers will pass through LAX this Labor Day weekend, beginning Friday, September 4 through Monday, September 7.\nThis is seven percent higher than the 780,716 actual passengers during last year’s holiday weekend. “Getaway Friday” and Labor Day Monday are expected to be the busiest days with more than 228,000 and 216,700 passengers, respectively. In addition, more than 310,600 vehicles are expected to enter the airport’s Central Terminal Area this weekend, four percent more than last year’s 298,466 actual vehicles. The busiest traffic days are expected to be Friday with nearly 79,000 vehicles, Sunday with over 86,300 vehicles, and Monday with over 80,400 vehicles.\nTo reduce traffic congestion in and around LAX, passengers are strongly encouraged to take public transportation to and from LAX, including shuttle vans; local and long-distance buses; the Metro Rail Green Line; taxis; limousines; and the LAX FlyAway™ nonstop bus service from Hollywood, Santa Monica, Union Station, Van Nuys, and Westwood. Motorists picking up passengers are reminded to use the LAX Cell Phone Waiting Lot at 96th Street and Vicksburg, where they can wait up to two hours for free until their arriving passengers call from terminal curbside.\n“Our newly enhanced LAXisHappening.com site includes up-to-date modernization and construction information, travel tips and maps that can help guests anticipate potential travel impacts or delays, even before they head to the airport,” said Mary Grady, managing director of media and public relations for Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA).\n“But equally important, the expanded site is a great resource for discovering new restaurants and shopping opportunities once inside the airport.” Not sure the terminal for an airline? LAXisHappening.com now includes a “terminal finder” search function that allows passengers to enter an airline and quickly find out the appropriate terminal with a click of a button. The site features terminal-by-terminal information about where to eat and shop now, what’s coming in the future, an up-to-date terminal map, travel tips, and specific modernization impacts by terminal.\nInformation on the site will be updated regularly as construction progresses and milestones are announced. “With five of the airport’s nine terminals under construction, updated information by terminal will be extremely helpful for passengers who want to plan ahead,” added Grady. “Also, with a same-day boarding pass, travelers can dine or shop at any terminal in the airport, which is a great way to explore all that’s new at LAX, while passing the time before or between flights.”\nLAXisHappening.com has been updated with new visual content, featuring photos of recently completed terminal amenities, lounges, artwork, new eateries and retail locations. The site includes a livestream of the airport’s @flyLAXAirport Twitter feed for up-to-the-minute news and announcements.\nIts design also continues to build on the use of visually memorable and colorful icons – introduced in the campaign’s first phase in 2014 – that translate easily for both domestic and international travelers. Using responsive design technology, LAXisHappening.com is optimized for desktop, tablet and mobile use to help travelers on-the-go stay connected and plan ahead from any device.\nThe site is currently being promoted through the airport’s WiFi log-in page, outdoor signage and LAWA’s social media channels. Since 2013, the airport’s modernization milestones include completion of the New Tom Bradley International Terminal; renovation of Terminal 5 (Delta Air Lines); Central Utility Plant Replacement to more efficiently heat and cool the airport; a dramatically new “look” for the airport’s Central Terminal Area featuring sculptured light poles and a programmable lightband; new escalators, elevators and moving walkways in many of the airport terminals and parking garages; and more electrical charging stations.\nCurrently Terminals 1, 2, 6, 7 and 8 are in various stages of renovation. Other planned projects for the future include an Automated People Mover that will provide convenient access to the Central Terminal Area, along with a consolidated Rental Car Center and Intermodal Transportation Facilities that will provide multiple locations to pick up and drop off passengers, as well as park.\nAll enhancements are part of the ongoing multi-billion-dollar LAX Modernization Program, which is funded by operating revenues, capital improvement program funds, fees from airlines, passenger facility charges, and airport revenue bond proceeds. No money from the Los Angeles City General Fund is being used for modernization projects.
