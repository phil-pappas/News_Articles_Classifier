Picture: REUTERS Related articles Business strategies to bolster your customer base Philosophy is key to coaching performance EISH, the Rugby World Cup has been an emotional roller-coaster ride so far, and we are only in week three. South African rugby supporters have been wearing their hearts on their sleeves. There have been calls for Springbok coach Heyneke Meyer to go and for that old war horse, Jean de Villiers, to step aside for the explosive Jesse Kriel. Tragically for De Villiers, fate has dictated this happens regardless.\nThe Japanese team and their Australian coach, Eddie Jones, have rocked the Boks and the established rugby world, and will never be underestimated again.\nSince last Saturday night, the host nation, England, are under enormous pressure to make the knockout stages. The Boks will be relieved that the media’s spotlight will be focused elsewhere for the week.\nConsider freshening up your board meetings during the Rugby World Cup by using some sports lingo to introduce certain leadership principles into the fabric of your company.\nHere are a few leadership reflections from the tournament thus far that can be applied to businesses and organisations:\nDavid and Goliath: playing to your strengths. Instead of being mesmerised by the Springbok’s legacy, bulk and stature, the Japanese focused on their strengths and refused to be bullied out of the game.\nAre you feeling dwarfed by your competitors? Is it time to focus on your strengths and unique traits as a company?\nGame plan: is it current or outdated? Meyer has been persisting with outdated software that won him trophies for the Blue Bulls, a long time ago.\nIt reminds me of when Amazon adopted their game plan to overthrow traditional booksellers in the mid-90s.\nThey envisioned a day when book buyers would bypass their favourite book store and have their book posted to their home. While the US book retail giants slept, Amazon gobbled up the market. Is your game plan outdated?\nHumility: are you prepared to admit when you are wrong? As leaders there is such pressure always to show our strong side, however, transparency and vulnerability are very attractive traits.\nSaying \"I am sorry\" or \"the directors adopted the wrong strategy\", can endear you to your subordinates. Don’t allow your company to be buried by your pride.\nIt was refreshing to see Meyer admit he had adopted the wrong game plan and to hear De Villiers express his longing for the Boks to win whether he was on the field, the bench or in the stands.\n...\nNEW blood: Companies and teams need a steady flow of new blood into their veins. In their book, The Leadership Challenge, Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner describe the five practices of exemplary leaders. The first is that \"leadership challenges the process\".\nAre you allowing new and fresh thinking to challenge your established methods and processes? Do we need a Kiwi or an Australian to be the next Bok coach? Don’t you think we shall be stronger as a rugby nation by inviting world leaders to shape our team?\nGenerational blend: is there synergy between the generations under your corporate roof? An ancient Jewish proverb says that: \"The glory of young men is their strength; grey hair the splendour of the old.\"\nWouldn’t it be wonderful if there was greater mutual respect between the generations? It isn’t just the old who need to be respected; we need to bestow dignity on emerging leaders by inviting them to share their opinion.\nYour younger employees might not yet be ready to be a director, but you can give them influence and a voice in your company.\n• Shippey is a partner at Change Partners", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:40:43.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
