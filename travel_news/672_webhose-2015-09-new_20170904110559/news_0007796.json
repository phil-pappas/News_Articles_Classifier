We reduce it by maybe 50% per peak and you can save 20% on your electricity bill,\" said Dr Moolman.\nHe said the next step for him is to meet the demand for his product and the money he won will go a long way to ensuring that it happens.\n\"I had a good job at CSIR, gave up the salary to start a business... I was the head of commercialisation at CSIR so I advised people on how to start businesses and I thought ‘how can I do that if I hadn’t done it myself’; it’s not legitimate... how do I know even if my advice works,\" said Dr Moolman.\nHe also said he chose to be an entrepreneur to create jobs: \"We keep saying we need jobs ... and we’re sitting and waiting for it to happen.\"\nThe third prize was a joint prize of R300 000 to Baoberry, a company that invented the AqueouSphere, a floating wetland that treats water naturally using plants that extract pollutants from the water, and GezaJozi’s Recycle e-Trike, an electric tricycle provided to trolley recyclists for free so they can safely transport waste.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T18:19:34.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
