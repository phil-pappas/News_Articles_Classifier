I am very humble; it’s a great honour and responsibility that has been given to me today.\n“We need to have economic vision, a leadership that explains the great challenges we face.”\nEarlier, Mr Turnbull beamed as he left the partyroom flanked by his deputy, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. Mr Abbott looked stunned as he walked past the cameras.\nThere was a second vote for deputy leader, which Foreign Minister Julie Bishop won over Kevin Andrews, 70-30.\nThere were two extra votes for the deputy leader contest because there was one informal ballot for the first vote and Victorian senator Michael Ronaldson made it to the partyroom in time for the second vote.\nMr Turnbull takes the nation’s top job after responding to more than a year of dissatisfaction with the leadership of Tony Abbott by launching a brutal and well-planned challenge.\nHis 10-vote victory means Australia has had four prime ministers in just over two years, with Labor’s Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd filling out the extraordinary list.\nA successful Malcolm Turnbull leaves with Julie Bishop after winning the leadership ballot at Parliament House in Canberra tonight.

Picture: Ray Strange Source: News Corp Australia\nFor the third time since 2010, voters will wake up tomorrow to find the person they had gone to bed thinking was their prime minister replaced without them having a say at an election.\nIt was a humiliation for Mr Abbott, who replaced Mr Turnbull as opposition leader in December 2009 and appeared to cement his position in the Liberal hierarchy with a huge win over Mr Rudd in 2013.\nHe now will be recorded as one of the shortest-serving Liberal Prime Ministers with one year and 361 days, just ahead of Harold Holt who died in the Portsea surf in 1967.\nAnd to rub in that humiliation, the Australian dollar rose on news of his downfall.\nThe government will undergo a massive overhaul of style and substance with a new frontbench expected to include Scott Morrison, an Abbott supporter, getting the job of Treasurer.\nJulie Bishop, who in the afternoon told Mr Abbott he had lost the confidence of his colleagues, will retain the deputy leadership.\nMs Bishop’s overwhelming win indicates the party is not going to punish her for turning on Mr Abbott.\nMinisters who backed Mr Abbott now will be waiting to hear their own fate in a Turnbull executive — should there be a job for them.\nThat includes some of the frontbenchers who walked in with Mr Abbott, including Joe Hockey, Eric Abetz, Jamie Briggs, Greg Hunt, Bruce Bilson, Josh Frydenberg, Kevin Andrews and Mathias Cormann.\nMr Turnbull’s ascension to the nation’s top job is likely to threaten Labor’s strong polling numbers.

JG\n— Julia Gillard (@JuliaGillard) September 14, 2015\nMr Turnbull won’t be prime minister officially until he is sworn in by Governor-General Peter Cosgrove.\nThe Coalition’s junior partner The Nationals — who have had a strained relationship with Mr Turnbull in the past — will meet in the morning to discuss their reaction to the leadership change, the ABC reports.\nTonight’s outcome makes Mr Abbott the shortest-serving prime minister since Harold Holt, who died swimming in the ocean in 1967.\nMalcolm Turnbull arrives for the Liberal leadership ballot in Parliament House.

A style of leadership that respects the people’s intelligence, that explains these complex issues and sets out the course of action we believe we should take and makes a case for it. We need advocacy, not slogans.”\nMalcolm Turnbull before his press conference at Parliament House in Canberra this afternoon.

His downfall was his belief that Australia should make polluters pay for their greenhouse gas emissions.\nOpinion polls show that Mr Turnbull is more popular than Mr Abbott, but many of those who prefer him vote for the centre-left Labor Party.\nMr Turnbull, who holds the seat of Wentworth in Sydney’s exclusive eastern suburbs, is the type of classical liberal who has become rare in the oddly named party, which has been overrun by conservatives in recent decades. It was called the Liberal Party when it was established in the early 1940s because it believed in individual freedoms, while their Labor opponents favoured state control and heavy regulation.\nMr Turnbull is a self-made multi-millionaire regarded by some as arrogant and has been nicknamed “The Silvertail” due to his wealth and privilege.\n— With AAP\nOriginally published as Malcolm Turnbull topples Abbott", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/09/14/1227527/324353-241ca648-5ad5-11e5-9b0f-3fea82bc0970.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/09/14/1227527/263979-2b94dc18-5ab4-11e5-93f1-755dafb8ee5a.jpg", "https://twitter.com/billshortenmp/status/643396259173167105", "https://twitter.com/JuliaGillard/status/643408487016329217", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/09/14/1227527/351194-2faea762-5adb-11e5-9b0f-3fea82bc0970.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/malcolm-turnbull-wins-liberal-leadership/story-fn5tas5k-1227527262266", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/09/14/1227527/359975-c10799e4-5adb-11e5-9b0f-3fea82bc0970.jpg", "https://twitter.com/billshortenmp/status/643396180894875648"], "published": "2015-09-15T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T16:14:28.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
