Milton, PA. -based Watsontown Trucking (WTC) has been providing solo truckload services since 1941, specializing in four key industry areas: automotive, building products, grocery and consumer goods. With 950 trailers, WTC also serves customers with specialized hauling needs.\nWatsontown Trucking already had a strong commitment to safety when its leaders decided to test the DriveCam Program to help them understand ways to improve driving behavior, reduce risk and protect their drivers. Mid-way through the trial of the DriveCam Program, Watsontown saw their drivers had accepted the program and significantly reduced risky driving. That's when Watsontown decided to immediately deploy the program fleet-wide.\n\"The DriveCam Program has helped make us better on the highway for our drivers and everybody around us,\" said Chad Mensch , Safety Director at Watsontown Trucking. \"It's also given our drivers peace of mind that the DriveCam video will protect them when an incident does happen. The video clips have exonerated drivers and provide us with a record of what happened so we can settle at-fault claims quickly.\"\nIn addition, exonerations and driver performance improvement through the DriveCam Program allow companies like Watsontown to retain drivers thereby reducing the fleet impact of the ongoing driver shortage. Lytx DriveCam Program helps prevent collisions, reduce injuries and save lives by combining video with predictive analytics, real-time driver feedback and coaching, empowering fleets to identify and correct driving behaviors that could lead to collisions. Watsontown Trucking chose to roll out the DriveCam technology fleet-wide, in part, because of the program's patented, iterative process of scoring, prioritizing and tracking the results of driving behaviors.\n\"Watsontown Trucking's success with the DriveCam Program is a testament to the power of video and the increased driver accountability and awareness it inspires,\" said Jim Rice , Commercial Leader, Mid-Market Team for Lytx. \"We measure our success by the success our clients have with our program. Chad and the Watsontown team achieved positive results quickly and continue to benefit from improved driving behavior and the protection the DriveCam Program provides.\"\nTop industry leaders in every significant commercial transportation segment choose Lytx. Lytx's success can be attributed to the company's comprehensive program that includes best practices benchmarking by industry, as well as access to subject matter experts who aid in minimizing financial, operational, legal, and driver risk. Furthermore, the program combines an innovative, open architecture with an upgradable technology platform and proprietary analytics.\nAbout Watsontown Trucking\nOver its 74 year history, Watsontown Trucking Company has grown into a reputable, dependable business with a fleet of more than 325 trucks and 950 trailers.
