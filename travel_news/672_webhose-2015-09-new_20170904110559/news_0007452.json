The $6-million event is the season-opening tournament of the 2015-2016 PGA TOUR season.\n \nIt will be McIlroy’s first appearance in the Frys.com Open, while Woods previously played in 2011.\n \nMcIlroy is competing in the FedExCup playoffs and will be in the BMW Championship near Chicago next week. Earlier this year he won the World Golf Championship Match Play at Harding Park in San Francisco and the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, N.C. Those two wins have assured him a spot in the TOUR Championship in Atlanta, September 24-27. Currently the second ranked player in the world, McIlroy has won four major championships among his 11 PGA TOUR victories.\n \nWoods most recently played in late August at the Wyndham Championship in Greensboro, N.C., where he contended all week and tied for 10th. Woods is second to Sam Snead in all-time PGA TOUR victories with 79 wins, with Snead at 82. Woods has won 14 major championships, second to the record of Jack Nicklaus, who won 18.\n \n“Everyone in Northern California is looking forward to this exciting tournament at Silverado,” said tournament host Johnny Miller. “Congratulations to Tournament Chairperson Kathy Kolder and the Frys.com Open staff for putting together a great tournament.”\n \nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T18:23:46.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
