The three-day fair from 1 to 3 September will showcase local Chiba Prefecture products such as fresh pears, chocolates, peach jellies, as well as Japanese culture such as kimono-wearing, Kendama game and Hina dolls.\nThe fair is part of efforts between Malaysia and Japan to forge closer tourism ties with each other.\n“Fairs such as the one we are about to experience here today is a great way to learn about the culture, heritage and nature of a particular destination. It is also hoped that it will increase the tourist arrivals and enhance cultural appreciation between Malaysia and Japan especially Chiba Prefecture,” Dato’ Seri Mohamed Nazri said at the launch of the Chiba Fair.\nReciprocal tourism efforts have been made in recent months to boost tourist arrivals from Japan to Malaysia including a media familiarisation trip for a group of Japanese media to Malaysia, the hosting of Japanese youths from Chiba Prefecture to Malaysia for cultural awareness programmes, Malaysia tourism and cultural fairs in several Japan cities, and advertising activities.\nLast week, the Hon. Minister had welcomed a group of taxi drivers from Japan who wanted to learn more about Malaysia since Tourism Malaysia had implemented a taxi wrapping advertising campaign in Japan on their taxis.\nLater this evening, the Deputy Minister of Tourism and Culture Datuk Mas Ermieyati Samsudin, will welcome passengers arriving on the inaugural All Nippon Airways (ANA) flight from Tokyo to Kuala Lumpur. With this new development, total flight connectivity between Japan and Malaysia is 55 weekly flights.\nJapan is one of Malaysia’s top ten tourist generating markets. In 2014, tourist arrivals from Japan to Malaysia recorded a growth of 7.8% to 553,106 tourists compared to 2013. In the first four months of 2015, Malaysia registered a total of 149,951 Japanese tourists. This year, Malaysia aims to attract 600,000 Japanese tourists to the country in conjunction with Malaysia Year of Festivals (MyFest) 2015.\nSource:- Tourism Malaysia", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T18:03:13.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
