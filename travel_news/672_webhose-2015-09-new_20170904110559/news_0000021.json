The multi-faceted experience features a tavern on one side, perfect for sipping a local brew and enjoying down-home cuisine; and a full-service restaurant on the other.\nDining selections range from Southern staples to innovative new dishes. Small plate starters include chicken and sausage gumbo, citrus-glazed pork belly and prawns, and crawfish and corn bisque. The impressive entree selection includes favorites like fresh Louisiana catfish and country-braised short ribs, as well as dinner-for-two selections like beer can chicken for two and a certified Angus Beef tenderloin for two. Finally, guests can finish the meal with a diverse dessert menu that offers something for every sweet tooth, from the light and cool berries and cream to the rich and decadent warm bread pudding.\nThe restaurant's signature whimsy shines in the collection of hot sauces. A menu of nearly 20 hot sauces is available for customers to pair with their dishes, including ghost pepper and blueberry, habanero carrot curry, and serrano ginger lemongrass.\nThe Spotted Horse is the latest installment in an ongoing effort to enhance amenities at Boyd Gaming properties across the country.
