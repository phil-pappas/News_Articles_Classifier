This lifetime achievement award -- the highest honor in the organization -- is bestowed upon a long-standing Select Registry member with many years of service to the organization and the hospitality industry. It was awarded on September 10th at Select Registry's Membership Conference in Key West, Florida .\nPhil Jenkins has been a leader in the lodging and hospitality industry for more than 20 years, and served as Select Registry's CEO from 2012 through 2014. He has a passion for property development and service excellence; he owned, managed, and developed three properties into award winners, and was an advisor to AAA on inspection criteria and standards for the Four Diamond Award. The 1842 Inn of Macon, Georgia , a Select Registry member property, was named \"One of the Top Ten Inns in North America \" and was featured in numerous travel and design publications. His philosophy that \"the crux of success for all inns today is finding the right balance between 'high touch' and 'high tech' \" has earned industry recognition and acclaim.\n\"Phil has an uncanny ability for recognizing the essentials of customer service whether it be applied to his own successful lodging properties or association level work,\" said Mark Reichle , Select Registry's Board President. \"Many of Select Registry's successful programs and initiatives are a direct result of Phil's member focus, a tireless work effort and passion for the greater good. His contribution to Select Registry and his commitment to the lodging industry are unparalleled.\"\nIn the late 1990s, Phil was awarded Georgia's \"Hotelier of the Year\" and continues to serve on various industry boards. He was founding chairperson of the Holmes County Lodging Council in Ohio , and has been a governance and planning consultant for Select Registry. Phil's love for design and preservation earned him feature stories on the PBS series \"Historic Hotels of America\" and the popular series, \"Great Country Inns of North America .\" His commitment to the \"farm to fork\" restaurant concept in Ohio has encouraged greater understanding of sustainable agriculture and the use of local foods.\n\"I am deeply honored by this coveted award,\" said Phil Jenkins . \"I'm also mindful of many mentors in the background who encouraged me over many years and inspired my vision of success, including Stafford Smith .\"\nNamed after the first president of Select Registry, the Stafford Smith Award was first given in 2000 (the year the organization changed its name from the Independent Innkeepers' Association). Since knowledge of membership, history, participation, contribution, involvement, and overall support of Select Registry and the bed and breakfast industry are crucial criteria, Select Registry staff, CEO, and its Board of Directors choose nominees for the award.\nAbout Select Registry\nFounded in 1972 as the Independent Innkeepers' Association by Norman Simpson , the \"Father of Country Inn travel in America,\" Select Registry evolved from Simpson's popular and pioneering book, Country Inns and Back Roads . Today, Select Registry is a portfolio of more than 300 quality-assured premier inns, bed and breakfasts, and small hotels throughout North America . Each of our member properties has passed an unannounced, rigorous, 200-point quality assurance inspection to earn and maintain its Select Registry membership, and to ensure it provides travelers with guaranteed quality, exceptional service, and an unforgettable lodging experience.
