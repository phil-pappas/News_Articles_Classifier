That’s the clear conclusion of the 2015 Britain’s Healthiest Company Awards , which have again shown that employers who value the health and well-being of staff reap benefits in productivity. Those companies performing best in the awards had a 24 per cent lower cost of lost productivity (associated with absenteeism and presenteeism) compared with the worst-performing companies. By looking after staff they looked after the bottom line. It is exciting to see a new winner in Johnson & Johnson, although Nomura, second this year and an award winner in 2014, deserve a prize for consistency of effort. 32 of 42 repeat participants showed an improvement in their Healthiest Company Score The awards, sponsored by VitalityHealth and Mercer, and in academic partnership with RAND Europe and the University of Cambridge, and in their third year, are based on research from 111 companies across the UK, with 32,538 employees (up from 25,102 last year) voluntarily submitting responses to surveys on all aspects of well-being. The answers are revealing, with positive news, such as increased enthusiasm and awareness around exercise, offset by behaviours (including smoking and alcohol consumption) that are persistently difficult to tackle. One of the most interesting markers is Vitality Age, which estimates an age – based on clinical and lifestyle health risks (such as smoking) – and compares it with the one on your passport. The average age of respondents is 39 years, five months, but the average Vitality Age is 43 years, three months. That gap is consistently worse for men than women (on average by nine months), and for lower-paid workers (those earning below £30,000 have a Vitality Age increase of nine months), but the number of employees whose Vitality Age is more than eight years higher than their actual age is falling. The research also makes it clear that even companies that do offer well thought-out employee health and well-being strategies need to do more to encourage awareness. Taking part in the awards is certainly useful in itself: 32 of 42 repeat participants showed an improvement in their Healthiest Company Score, the composite meausre of workplace and employee health used in the survey, with the most important driver being workplace culture. Partly this depends on a clear communications strategy and it is good to see that 77 per cent of companies now use emails and newsletters to promote health campaigns. Seventy per cent of offices use posters and other visual cues around the workplace, and nearly one in five employers now provides line-manager training in health and well-being. Employers who do consider the physical fitness of their workforce can be reassured they are supporting mental-health concerns too So what areas are taken most seriously? Nearly 60 per cent of companies now provide stress-management information; almost all offer bicycle storage racks and more than three-quarters have bicycle purchase schemes. Perhaps the most popular interventions are in the canteen, where 62 per cent offer healthy alternatives, and 65 per cent provide fresh fruit and vegetables. Healthy eating information is supplied by almost two-thirds of companies; one-third extend that to dietitian/nutritionist services. This fits well with what employees say they want: 57.2 per cent are motivated to change their BMI (body mass index), with 52.5 per cent hoping to take up more physical activity and 25.7 per cent keen to improve their nutrition. But the data makes it clear that where employers tackle the more difficult areas of health – stress, smoking and alcohol intake – impressive gains could still be made. Of those who tried corporate work-life balance programmes, 71 per cent said they had benefited from them. And 77 per cent of those that tried counselling for alcohol consumption reported benefits. Certainly, employers who do consider the physical fitness of their workforce can be reassured they are supporting mental-health concerns too. The research shows a clear link between higher rates of depression in those who were obese or underweight. There’s clearly no doubt of the quantifiable benefits to companies and individual employees of a smartly structured, wisely communicated well-being strategy.
