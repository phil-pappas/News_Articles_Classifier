The eight month development has created a stylish bolt-hole situated in one of Surrey’s most idyllic locations. \nJust eight miles from central London, the independent hotel has reconfigured more than half of its bedroom stock, over five floors, to create larger rooms and design-led bathrooms. Now boasting a total of 142 bedrooms, the hotel - in partnership with Heal’s - has re-styled the furniture employing brands such as Villeroy & Boch, Kaldewei and Grohe. Fitting for today’s business and leisure travellers, Richmond Hill has fused heritage and on trend interiors with the latest technology from Samsung, and unlimited Sky HD channels in the new bedrooms. Additionally, the hotel’s 15 meeting rooms have also been refreshed with a classic palate of colours and the installation of progressive in-room technology, specifically for the needs of conference and business delegates. New branding and collateral, inspired by the venue’s location and history, further positions the hotel as a property with an independent flair and service led attitude. The hotel is located on one of London’s most prestigious residential areas and has far reaching views across the capital as captured by JMW Turner (1775-1851) painting ‘Richmond Hill’. Diane Tapner-Evans, General Manager at Richmond Hill Hotel, comments: “We pride ourselves in delivering the best experience for both our corporate and leisure guests. The enhancements we’ve made to the hotel, alongside our partnership with Heal’s, will ensure that Richmond Hill Hotel continues to provide excellence and sophistication for our guests. “We are also excited for imminent additions: the Roaring and Startled Stags; two sculptures designed by George Hider, in-keeping with neighboring Royal Richmond Park’s Fallow and Red deer. The two stags have been made from reclaimed metal and will stand at the entrance to the hotel.” Situated on the edge of 2,500 acres of Richmond Park, the hotel is situated less than 30 minutes from central London. Richmond Hill Hotel is steeped in history, character and charm, and offers a stunning venue for both corporate and leisure guests.
