His term ends on Jan. 14. The leading candidate to replace him, Manuel Baldizón, had called for Congress to strip his immunity.\nBaldizón leads right-wing party Renewed Democratic Liberty, the largest in Congress.\nGuatemalans celebrate after Congress voted unanimously to strip President Otto Pérez Molina’s immunity in Guatemala City, on Sept. 1, 2015, clearing the way for him to be prosecuted over allegations that he masterminded a massive corruption scheme.\nJohán Ordóñez/AFP\n‘Pressure cooker that exploded’\nGuatemalans have taken to the streets in protest every week since April, when investigators first accused a top aide to then-vice president Roxana Baldetti of involvement in the corruption.\nBaldetti, who resigned as vice president in May , was arrested on Aug. 21 and is in jail awaiting trial over her alleged role in the scheme.\nThe probe also has nabbed the head of Guatemala’s tax administration, his predecessor and several dozen other agency officials.\nSome protesters are calling for Sunday’s elections to be postponed until sweeping political reforms can be implemented in Guatemala, a country of 15.8 million people that is troubled by poverty, drug trafficking and violent crime.\nThe protests, on a scale never before seen in Guatemala, are “historic,” said Manfredo Marroquín, the director of the local branch of anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International. “It’s like a pressure cooker that exploded.”\nPresident Otto Pérez Molina, as he has long deserved, is going to prison. Unanimous vote, even his own party voted against him!\n— Francisco Goldman (@PacoGoldman) September 1, 2015\nNobel Peace Prize winner Rigoberta Menchú, a Guatemalan indigenous activist, called on protesters to refrain from violence, accusing Pérez Molina of waging a campaign to provoke them.\n“I call on Guatemalan society not to fall into the trap of provocation, to reject violence, racial hatred and class warfare being stirred up by hidden powers and people linked to the criminal networks of corruption,” she said in a statement.\nInvestigators say their accusations are based on some 89,000 wire-tapped phone calls that uncovered a scheme called “La Línea” (‘The Line”), named for a hotline businesses would call to access corrupt officials and get illegal discounts on their customs duties.\nPérez Molina has been left increasingly isolated by the scandal.\nThe attorney general’s office, the comptroller’s office and prominent voices in the business community have all joined the calls for him to go.\nSix of his 14 ministers have resigned in recent days, along with several other top officials.\n#OPMSinInmunidad : así votaron las bancadas para retirar inmunidad a Pérez Molina http://t.co/C8v0mfwn5u Vía @alexr_pl pic.twitter.com/aob86miaz9\n— Prensa Libre (@prensa_libre) September 1, 2015", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Publinews_GT/status/638842256657551360", "http://t.co/aob86miaz9", "https://twitter.com/PacoGoldman/status/638841121611776000", "https://twitter.com/CongresoGuate", "http://t.co/C8v0mfwn5u", "http://t.co/y1OFxiI1zr", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Guatemala?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPMSinInmunidad?src=hash", "https://t.co/Tf7pgqE1Wr", "https://twitter.com/alexr_pl", "https://twitter.com/jomaburt/status/638846771070902272", "https://twitter.com/prensa_libre/status/638854977163763712", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/OttoPerezMolina?src=hash"], "published": "2015-09-02T07:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T20:22:31.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
