Cyber-criminals are always coming up with new ways to exploit email to do harm. Email attacks are becoming extremely sophisticated, making it difficult for brands to fight back, and considering that 97 per cent of people around the globe cannot identify a phishing email the impact can be huge. After falling victim to email fraud, the trust that consumers have in your brand will be affected, and this will ultimately affect their buying decisions – with recent studies suggesting that 60 per cent of your customers will think about moving, and 30 per cent actually will. 97 per cent of people around the globe cannot identify a phishing email Fraudsters typically use phishing techniques to trick email recipients into giving up sensitive information or credentials for malicious reasons. This information could include social security numbers, bank login details, credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information (PII). Phishers will either profit directly from data such as credit cards and/or sell data on the black market to other phishers who are developing their own cyber-crime schemes. To conduct phishing attacks, cyber-criminals will spoof, or masquerade as, a legitimate government agency, bank, retailer or other brand the recipient might recognise – making those emails very compelling and relevant to their intended victims. Brands have a responsibility to protect their customers from such threats by securing the email channel. A critical first step is to implement the latest email authentication protocols – including SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance), to block fraudulent emails before they even hit the inbox. DMARC is the first and only widely deployed technology that can not only help protect your customers and brand against email fraud, but also discourage cyber-criminals. Brands that have implemented a DMARC record are targeted far less by fraudsters. Phishers can erode years of goodwill in a second by exploiting your brand, but only if you let them. The most forward-thinking CISOs and CIOs understand that securing the email channel needs to be a priority for the business, and with PwC’s latest US cyber-security leadership study stating that cyber-security is now a board oversight issue, now is the time for security professionals to take a proactive approach to email fraud protection. • For more information call +44 (0)20 7034 5430 or visit returnpath.com/stopemailfraud", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T00:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T20:52:39.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
