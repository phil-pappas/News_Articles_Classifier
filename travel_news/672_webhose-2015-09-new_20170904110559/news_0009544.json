It also invites users trying to complete a booking without a hotel to return to the workflow and search the inventory provided by the feeds from the three online travel booking sites. \n\nGrafton added: “With that strategy we believe we can significantly reduce hotel leakage. This will help to reduce compliance burden for corporates, improve travel policy compliance and ultimately drive further savings through their managed travel programme.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T10:25:56.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
