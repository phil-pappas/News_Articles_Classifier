Mary Wing, leather designer harness maker “Yet the fact is, that there are tens of thousands of people in this country who are working with their hands.” Living proof of which is provided by the organisation QEST, which stands for Queen Elizabeth Scholarship Trust, and whose headquarters are just a short stroll from Buckingham Palace. It's the charitable arm of the Royal Warrant Holders' Association, and was set up to mark the Queen Mother's 90th birthday, a quarter of a century ago. Next year, The Queen herself will become its new patron, when she too reaches the age of 90. Already she has attended a number of events at which the work of QEST students have been showcased , and admired the work of 24-year-old textile artist Gillian Murphy, whose scholarship at the Royal College of Art was sponsored by Matlock-based knitwear firm John Smedley. There is even a portrait of the monarch, hanging in the organisation's boardroom, painted by a young, QEST-funded artist. But despite its royal provenance, the charity sets out not to help those born with silver spoons in their mouths, but to help talented young craftspeople dream up and design those spoons in the first place. Or if cutlery doesn't happen to be their forte, the Trust will lend a hand to talented young 20-somethings with an ambition to go into bookbinding, goldsmithing, basket-weaving, shoemaking, clock-repairing, saddle manufacturing, guitar-making or any one of scores of different crafts (130 at the last count). • From man at arms to man of straw Yes, if you are young, gifted and determined to leave your mark on the world when it comes to making things, then QEST can act as your benefactor when it comes to paying for apprenticeships, courses or a period of study with a master craftsperson, be it a guitar-maker in the USA or a gold inlay expert in Japan. Take 27-year-old Thomas Merrett, for example. Always keen on drawing and modelling, he was allowed by Mrs Way, his far-sighted schoolteacher, to skip the odd art class in order to go out sketching and drawing. And it didn't stop there. Having trained for three years as a stone carver at the City and Guilds College in South London, Thomas spent all his spare time working for sculptors and statue-makers, repairing stone figures on every London pediment from the Athenaeum to the Foreign Office, and eventually going on a QEST-funded course at the Academy of Art, in Florence. “The thing is, you never stop learning, never stop progressing”, says Thomas, who now has his own studio in Walthamstow. “At the moment, I'm very interested in getting into creating carved medals.” Such as the one he has brought today, a pale stone roundel on which he has created the face of the French writer Balzac, the product of a day spent at the Père Lachaise Cemetery, in Paris. Oluwaseyi Sosanya, Woodworker and Design Engineer As for Oluwaseyi Sosanya, 31, his talents lie in the altogether less traditional field of woodwork and design engineering. He started with Lego, moved onto chess (it improved his logical thought processes), and after a QEST-assisted degree at the Royal College of Art, started making, firstly, wooden frames for houses in America, then wooden cages for i-phones. As well as putting in three years with a computer firm in Taipei, plus a period of time in the USA working with inspirational furniture designer Ken Tomita. It sounds like a long and slightly disjointed apprenticeship. “Was I nervous? Yes, I suppose I was”, he replies. “But like a lot of craftspeople, I find that I rather embraced that uncertainty. I've now become very interested in this connection between humans and machines, and I have designed a device that can weave in three dimensions.” Instead, then, of producing a flat piece of wispy material, the end result is a solid, interlocking mass, with countless applications, one of which is the manufacturing of indestructible shoe soles. Indeed, far from being ivory tower-dwellers, the QEST beneficiaries (there have been 354 in the past 25 years) have their feet firmly fixed on the ground and their eyes very firmly fixed on a career. The maximum amount any one applicant can receive is £18,000, and from that amount has to come as much as three years' college fees and living expenses. Out of every eight applicants for QEST money, then, only one will secure the funding they are after. “We don't take on hobbyists, or people who aren't really sure what they want to do”, says Lyanne Nicholl, QEST's director. “We only fund people who are excellent at what they do, and determined to carry on doing it.” As for the money, that comes both from individual and donor organisations, plus the 800 firms who bear the crest of Royal Warrant Holders. Names that range from Peter Jones to Bendicks Mints, from gunmakers Holland and Holland to cashmere and textile-makers Johnstons of Elgin. And speaking of fabrics, there are several young QEST-folk who are making a name for themselves in the clothing world. Like 24-year-old Gillian Murphy, a Glasgow School of Art graduate now specialising in working with old or secondhand materials. “My goal is re-designing the life of the garment”, says Gillian. “I find the Slow Movement very inspiring, and my aim is to slow down the pace of fashion. “One day I'd love to have my own collection, based along those lines. For the moment, though, I have to make ends meet, by working part-time in a Kensington boutique, and by sticking to meals of spiralised courgette and pasta!” Typically, Gillian's parents (father a retired police inspector, mother PA) are not from the world of design. The same applies to 24-year-old Lisa McConniffe, from Oldham; her father is a manager, and her mother a teacher, yet her designs are from a technicolour world of imagination: dramatic, multi-coloured purse bags just big enough to house a mobile phone and make-up. “There's no doubt that Britain is known all round the world for its high levels of craftsmanship” “I'm exploring the world of throwaway fashion, using materials such as cardboard”, she says. “So often, you see celebrities out with a handbag and then they're never seen with it again. “At the same time, I'm on a course with two other students, doing leather work with Bill Amberg [a renowned craftsman]. It's exactly what I want to to be doing; I'm so keen, I even go into college on Sundays.” The same living-the-dream story applies to 31-year-old Billy Lloyd, who trained for three years in ceramics, and who freely admits he doesn't know what else he'd be doing. “I've made 200 ceramic lights for a new house, I've done some thrown tableware for a department store in Tokyo, but my biggest achievement has been to make a range of 50 different ceramic pieces, which Lady Conran bought for her husband Sir Terence Conran. “I've even been to their house to see it: 10 shelves, each with five of my pieces. Thing is, though, there's always new things to do and learn, and now I'm working in Stoke-on-Trent with Ed Bentley, who's a top ceramicist; Funny thing is, there are a lot of taxi drivers in Stoke who used to work in potteries.” With any luck, though that's a fate which won't befall these young people. The charity's figures show that, even after 25 years, some 93 per cent of all QEST fund recipients are still working in the crafts business. “There's no doubt that Britain is known all round the world for its high levels of craftsmanship”, says Mark Henderson. “You see it everywhere: Jaguar cars, Burberry's; go and look at a Bentley production line, and you'll be amazed by the level of skill involved. “That's what we are aiming to keep alive for future generations. Tradition, we believe, is about handing on the flame, not worshipping the ashes.” To find out more about QEST scholarships and apprenticeships, visit www.qest.org.uk @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T02:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T20:48:07.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
