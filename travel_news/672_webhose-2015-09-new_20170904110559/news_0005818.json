But it isn’t just about offering outstanding choice – Saga customers know what they want, and they trust Saga to provide it. After all, they’ve been taking them on holiday (and listening to their feedback) for more than 60 years. They believe it’s the little details that make their holidays and cruises stand out from the crowd, and whichever you choose, you can be assured that there are experts on hand every step of the way. Holiday Hunters – creating the dream Often taking inspiration from customers’ suggestions, their expert Holiday Hunters meticulously plan every holiday that they offer. Each specialises in a particular region that they are passionate about, building strong relationships with trusted local agents and hoteliers. They constantly research new experiences, ensuring that they take their customers to all the key sites as well as some undiscovered gems. “Last year I received a couple of letters from Saga customers looking for something much more adventurous. What they said stuck with me: “We might be slightly older but don’t forget, we grew up in the Sixties and we’re ready for anything!” \"This encouragement was all I needed. If our customers want adventure, I will do my best to provide it.” Expert Holiday Hunter, Kathy Vigolo on creating our new ‘Secrets of the Maya’ Escorted Tour. We might be slightly older but we grew up in the Sixties and we’re ready for anything! Road Testers – making sure everything is just right Once a holiday has been designed by Saga's Holiday Hunters, all the details are rigorously checked by their Quality team, who benchmark every single hotel to ensure that it exceeds expectations. No stone is left unturned – from counting steps to ensuring the brand of tea is just right – Saga believe it is this scrupulous checking of the details that lead more than 97 per cent of customers to rate their holiday as “excellent” or “good”. Advisors – helping you choose your perfect holiday Based in Kent, and a free phone call away, Saga advisors are friendly, well-trained travel consultants are happy to discuss your holiday plans and the choices available. They will ensure your holiday is hassle-free, explaining what the price of your chosen holiday includes and booking any extras you may require. “One of the best parts of my job is helping customers find the perfect cruise for them. Some are delighted when they realise they'll even be chauffeur-driven to the port and back.\" \"I suppose that’s the icing on the cake when you cruise with Saga. Not only do you get a great range of itineraries to choose from – you get all those added benefits such as included insurance and the chauffeur service. Plus a whole lot more.” Rebecca Johncock, Saga Cruise Consultant. 97 per cent of customers have rated their holidays with us as 'excellent' or 'good' Hosts – the warmest of welcomes Every Saga holiday is accompanied by a tour manager or representative, they are experts in the region and will be on hand to offer recommendations and local insights. They will also promote a sociable atmosphere, particularly important for our solo travellers, and provide constant support and assistance, should you need it. They are also supported 24 hours a day by staff at head office, so you can relax and enjoy your holiday. On board every small Saga ship, you will be greeted by a wonderful, dedicated crew. A high ratio of crew to guests enables them to provide exemplary service, so don’t be surprised if the staff get to know you by name, or the bar stewards remember your favourite tipple. Nothing is too much trouble. And it doesn’t end there… Saga are also dedicated to bringing their customers the best possible value for money, with no hidden extras. For example, all of their long-haul holidays and cruises include a car service, so you will be collected at your front door and taken to your port or airport, and then driven home again afterwards. It’s all part of the service.
