The hinges will fold up, allowing the plane to shorten its wingspan when it's rolling across airport taxiways.\nIt will be the first design of its kind on any commercial airliner, Boeing says.\nThe plane will have the widest wingspan of any aircraft in the company's 99-year history: 235 feet, 5 inches (71.8 meters).\nTo put it another way: It's wider than four 53-foot (16-meter) semi-truck trailers parked end to end.\nThe hinged wingtips alone will measure 12 feet. Locking pins will prevent them from folding during flight, Boeing tells CNN.\nPrototype testing is expected to get underway soon, Boeing says.\nDuring testing, engineers plan to fine-tune and try to perfect the final design.\nThese giant wings will give the airliner extra lift, like a giant sailplane glider.\nThey'll help the plane save an overall 12% more fuel than the Airbus A350, Boeing says.\nInitial versions of the 777 have been flying since the mid-1990s, and the 777X has been in the pipeline for two years already.\nBut the buzz got louder last week when Boeing announced it finalized a basic design .\nDigital cheers popped up all over Twitter and Facebook.\n\"The inside is amazing,\" Rohan Gosh tweeted.\nTwitter user Andres Vallekas expressed his delight with three hearts.\nCheck out the new 777X. The inside is amazing!! #aviation ttps://youtu.be/Fop6Qu2CN0E\nâ€” Rohan Ghosh (@RohanGhosh) June 18, 2015 Bigger windows, wider cabins\nLike the wings, the plane's cabin also will be big, Boeing says.\nThe 777-9X will seat at least 400 passengers . That's 34 more than the 777-9X's competitor -- the Airbus A350-1000 -- which holds 366 in a typical three-class configuration .\nThe 777-9X cabin will be 16 inches (40 centimeters) wider than the A350-1000, Boeing says, allowing economy-class seat widths up to 18 inches (46 centimeters).\nTypical airline seat widths range from 17 to 18.5 inches (43 to 47 centimeters).\nWhat else might grab air travelers? The window seats.\nThe 777-9X's windows will be 15% larger than competing airliners, Boeing says.\nThe windows will be placed at a height that will be eye level for most passengers.\nBOEING 777-9X Engines: Two\nAisles: Two\nTypical seating: 400 passengers\nCabin width: 5.97 meters (236 inches)\nWingspan (extended): 71.8 meters (235 feet, 5 inches)\nWingspan (on ground): 64.8 meters (212 feet, 8 inches)\nLength: 76.7 meters (251 feet, 9 inches)\nRange: 14,075 kilometers (8,746 miles)\nExpected to begin service: 2020\nList price: $400 million\nSource: Boeing Co.\nBoeing is hinting about other passenger goodies on the 777X, such as new lighting and \"enhanced architecture\" for the cabin's interior design.\nAirlines will have options to configure each passenger class differently.\nEach class could have unique overhead ceiling and stow bins, for example, that would \"create the feeling of separate and distinct cabins,\" Boeing says.\nWhat's powering this new plane?\nThrust comes courtesy of two fuel-sipping GE9X jet engines.\nAmazingly, the engines' fuel nozzle tips will be created via a process called additive manufacturing -- aka 3-D printing.\nSee how engineers \"print\" airliner engine parts\nAlthough the fuselage will be made of aluminum, the wings will consist of a strong, yet super bendy material that's driving the future of aviation: carbon-fiber reinforced polymer.\nBasically you could call it super plastic.\nBoeing: 777X http://t.co/4buwlqUfC4 New b777X. ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—\nâ€” DREAMER (@AndresVallekas) August 25, 2015 This is the same stuff that allowed Boeing's innovative twin-engine 787 Dreamliner to fly farther on less fuel when it first entered service in 2011 .\n\"We've learned from that, and we're taking applying it to the wings on this new plane,\" Boeing spokesman Scott Lefeber says.\nThese wings are baked\nBoeing plans to bake portions of the 777-9X in a sort of kitchen.\nWhat's on the menu? Wings.\nIt's a huge, 1.3 million-square-foot facility under construction near the company's longstanding factory in Everett, Washington.\nInside, Boeing plans to use three giant ovens called autoclaves to pressure-bake the 777X wings at temperatures up to about 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius).\n\"An easy way to understand it is, you're baking the material so it forms to the strength and characteristics that you want,\" Lefeber says.\nAfter the wings are baked, they'll be moved to Boeing's nearby plant for final assembly.\nSo, if the wings are made from carbon-fiber reinforced plastic, why not make the 777X fuselage out of the stuff, too?\nShort answer: A carbon-fiber composite fuselage would have added much more time to the development process, Boeing says.\nWith the 777X, Boeing says it wants to maintain the reliability of today's 777 while improving its economic profile and delivering it at a time when airlines \"need it most.\"\nProduction is expected to begin in 2017.\nThe first 777X could enter service as soon as 2020.\nSix airlines have placed orders for 320 777Xs, Boeing says, including Emirates, All Nippon Airways and Lufthansa.
