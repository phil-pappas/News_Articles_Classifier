Two new S200SX-E and six new S300SX-E super core configurations (turbochargers without turbine housings) are now available to the aftermarket through authorized performance turbocharger distributors. Engineered for car and truck enthusiasts, these high-performance units feature forged milled compressor wheels, and pre-machined speed sensor and boost ports. Additionally, the S300SX-E sports a 360-degree thrust bearing for improved thrust capability and reliability. Delivering up to a 3 percent increase in compressor efficiency and up to 25 percent more flow within the same frame size, these new AirWerks super cores offer a significant increase in performance and resulting power. The SX-E units are sold in a super core configuration, giving the performance distributor optimum inventory flexibility and assembly options. Companion SX series turbine housings are sold separately.\n\"BorgWarner is expanding our successful AirWerks series to add more performance options for car and truck enthusiasts,\" said Frederic Lissalde, President and General Manager, BorgWarner Turbo Systems. \"Many of the new features have been proven on our premium EFR™ (Engineered For Racing) turbochargers, the official turbocharger of the INDYCAR Series for several years. Customers will appreciate the powerful boost and reliability as well as more opportunities for convenient customization.\"\nBorgWarner's AirWerks series offers a customizable replacement turbocharger for applications where ancillary items such as blow-off valves and external wastegates are already configured and are in-field serviceable. Compressor wheels are forged prior to milling for added strength and durability. By reducing inertia and increasing air flow, BorgWarner's extended tip technology enables the compressor wheel to perform like a larger, heavier wheel and deliver faster spool-up with more powerful boost. In addition, pre-machined speed sensor and boost port bosses allow users to fine-tune their set up, reducing additional fabrication costs. Compressor inlet and outlet connections are designed to conveniently fit standard filters and hoses.\nThe new AirWerks S200SX-E super cores are available in 52 mm and 57 mm inducer sizes. The S300SX-E super cores are available in six new sizes from 61.4 mm to 69 mm. Featuring flexible dual outlet machining for a V-band or hose connection, S300SX-E super cores also offer a 360-degree thrust bearing upgrade for improved thrust capability and longer turbocharger life.
