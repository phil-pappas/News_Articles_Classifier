Instead of heading home after Lima on the celebrated Highlights of South America Premium Tour, you can continue on to Quito. The capital of Ecuador, Quito was founded in the 16th century on the ruins of an Inca city and named by Unesco as the best-preserved, least-altered historic centre in Latin America. After exploring Quito on a guided tour, you will fly to San Cristóbal Island and board the MV Santa Cruz II, a stylish vessel which sleeps just 90 guests. Famous for its native wildlife, the Galápagos Islands are home to sea lions, iguanas, whales, giant tortoises and blue-footed boobies. The first day of the cruise takes you past Punta Pitt, an eroded volcanic tuff cone, with a short hike taking you to a viewpoint over the shoreline. Stepping out: blue-footed boobies go a-courting Next, you will set off on a dinghy ride to Santa Fe Island, home to sea lions and land iguanas. Activity options include snorkelling or a glass-bottom boat ride to discover underwater treasures. After lunch back on board, the cruise continues to South Plaza Island where land iguanas sit underneath giant prickly pear cacti, watching hopefully for pears to drop. The following day you disembark at Puerto Ayora on Santa Cruz Island for a tour of the Charles Darwin Research Station. Here you can see the giant Galápagos tortoises, the largest living species of tortoise, well-documented by Charles Darwin in his journal. After learning about the amazing animals and the conservation work carried out by the Research Station, you can enjoy a choice of activities in the afternoon. Opt to go hiking, mountain biking or kayaking in Tortuga Bay before heading back to the ship for a relaxing dinner. Spiky character: a marine iguana basks in the sun The last full day in the Galápagos takes you to Punta Suárez, Española Island and Gardener’s Bay where you have the chance to spot playful sea lions on the beaches, marine iguanas, sea turtles, hood mockingbirds and warbler finches. Discovering the amazing islands that so inspired Darwin is the perfect way to end your South American tour. What’s included • Extend your South American adventure with a Galápagos Islands cruise. Lasting for 29 days in total, the extended trip costs from £9,695pp and includes accommodation on land and for four nights aboard M/V Santa Cruz II, return flights from London, all tipping, overseas transfers, taxes, and luggage porterage. Departures from February to October 2016. • For more information or to book, call 0800 046 7729 or visit aptouring.co.uk »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:47:47.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
