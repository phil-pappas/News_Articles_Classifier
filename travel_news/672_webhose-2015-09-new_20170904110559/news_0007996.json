Bad weather won't spoil your UK trip if you save for a rainy day - save up some ideas, that is. \nBritain may have a reputation for unpredictable and showery weather. But really, London's climate is about the same as the climate in Paris or anywhere in central and northern Europe. Keep these six rainy day ideas in reserve to make the most of your trip to Britain - or wherever you go. That way not one single day will be a washout just because of the weather.

Visit a Covered Market \nBritain's covered markets are often housed in giant, ornate sheds of cast iron and glass created in by the Victorians. They're great places to while away the hours, looking for special finds and chatting with the market traders. \nKirkgate Market in Leeds is Europe's largest enclosed Victorian market and full of surprises. Oxford's Covered Market has everything from sides of beef to crafty jewelry and antiques under brightly painted cast iron arcades. Bristol's St Nicholas Market has two glass arcades, a covered market and a gigantic market hall. On a rainy day there, I found three pairs of great sunglasses for just a fiver (I can always hope). The market traders of Birmingham's Bullring Indoor Market may change from time to time but they've been trading in the same spot for at least 850 years. If you're staying in London, Old Spitalfields Market and Greenwich Market provide hours of entertainment, good nosh and lots of designer maker clobber.

And it's one way to enjoy nature while staying out of the rain. \nIn Torquay, on the English Riviera, Kents Cavern is a 400 million year old cave complex with evidence of some of the oldest human occupation in Europe. The Wookey Hole Caves , near Wells in Somerset, were carved out by an underground river. The caverns of Cheddar Gorge, Cheddar Caves, are where the oldest skeleton in Britain was found. They're all family attractions now. \nTwo man-made underground attractions are also good bets. At the free, Big Pit National Coal Museum in South Wales descend 300 feet to explore the coal face and conditions underground in the company of a former coal miner. The underground mine tour at Llechwedd Slate Caverns in the heart of Snowdonia National Park , travels between the above ground and underground slate landscapes, both dark and mysterious. \nOne of the strangest underground tours you can take is inside Ben Cruachan , the hollow mountain, above Loch Awe in Argyll, Scotland, to see a hydroelectric plant, one kilometer underground. The Flotilla at the National Maritime Museum in Cornwall is an impressive collection of small boats, flying from the roof of the main hall. A collection of models, right, includes examples of rowing and sailing boats, working and leisure craft. © Ferne Arfin 3. Check Out an Unusual Museum \nBritain's most famous museums might already be on your must-see list. Rain or shine, a lot of visitors stop in at the British Museum , one of the Tate Galleries around the country or the museums of Edinburgh and Glasgow . \nSave some less famous museums and galleries for a rainy day. You'll find more than you ever imagined. \nAt the Old Operating Theatre Museum , across from Guys Hospital near London Bridge, talks about surgery before anaesthetics are not be for the squeamish. In Oxford's Ashmolean Museum , alongside important artworks and Egyptian antiquities, you can find a Renaissance dirty joke preserved in ceramic by artist Francesco Urbini. The National Maritime Museum Cornwall , in Falmouth, celebrates small boats and the sea. \nMuseums UK, an app available for iPhone and Android, sends location based museum lists to your smart phone, with dozens of choices for wherever you are when the skies open up.

You may not fancy the cold, gloomy atmosphere of an aquarium on a bright sunny day. But when it's raining there's something rather cosy about spending time with the fishes. \nThe Deep , in Hull, Europe's deepest aquarium, is my favorite. Sea Life , Brighton's aquarium has lots of fans and so does the London Aquarium on the South Bank. If you find yourself at a seaside resort, ask around. You might be surprised to find a first class aquarium. I was, just the other day in at SeaQuarium in Weston-super-Mare on the Somerset Coast. Selection of condiments in a British grocery store.

And I'm not talking about using the local grocery store as a singles pick-up spot. \nIf you're in a foreign country, especially if you like to cook, looking at the ingredients, spices, prepared foods and cookware used every day by ordinary people can be eye-opening. \nSupermarket browsing is something I learned from my mother. She and my Dad traveled a lot on business and wherever they went, she made a point of visiting local grocery stores and supermarkets to look around and to find packets of unusual seasonings and mixes to bring home. A little wet weather never hurts when you're dressed for it. Getty Images 6. Just Get Wet \nAs long as it's not cold and blustery, lots of things are lovely in the rain. The British worked that out a long time ago and rarely let a little wet weather stop them from having fun. \nThe grass smells sweeter, the sea is more dramatic, the reflections in puddles are more artistic and bright colors are richer and more saturated. \nDon't worry about packing an umbrella. Whenever it rains, local shops everywhere - newsagents , dry cleaners, chemists and hardware stores - set out stands with cheap umbrellas. If you're visiting the countryside, pick up an inexpensive pair of wellies or gumboots for splashing around on muddy paths. You can usually find them at garden centers or rural street markets. \nRemember how much fun a good splash can be. Stop worrying about your hair and enjoy it.
