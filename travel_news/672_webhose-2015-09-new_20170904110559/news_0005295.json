Using web platform indiegogo.com the show hopes to become the first fan-funded artist-created pilot bought by a network.\nSirtis stars as Dr. Camila a first-year intern who returns to medical school at age 50 after a messy divorce only to discover her new boss is just a few years older than her own son. It takes guts to start over and embark on a totally new journey when most people are thinking about retirement Sirtis said. Im convinced Camilas story will resonate when women everywhere are struggling for equal pay and theres an obvious lack of diversity and quality roles for older women in Hollywood.\nWith only forty days left and a fixed funding goal (if the Campaign fails to reach its target they receive nothing) of 1 . Sirtis implores supporters and strong women around the globe to take a stand and help the series get made. Sirtis said. If everyone rallied together and pitched in one dollar each our fundraiser would be a smash.\nThe campaign has just added a special Tea Time reward perk offering backers an in-person British-style tea social with the star herself. Were going to finance Internity even if it means I pour you a cup of tea or I go to your house to collect Sirtis jokingly warns. Just ask that Judi Dench what happened the last time she crossed me!\nCamilas boss Dr. Nate is a fanboy with a penchant for dream sequences involving actors from classic shows allowing the series to feature guest appearances from notable TV film and Comic-Con stars each week. The pilot will be directed by Sirtis former Star Trek: The Next Generation co-star Michael Dorn who will make a special cameo as his iconic Klingon character Lt. Worf. The best enticement was the chance to work with Michael. Reprising our Star Trek roles in a dream scene will be a hoot Sirtis said.\nInternity also stars Jim Beaver (Supernatural Deadwood Justified) and sitcom vets Richard Ruccolo (Two Guys a Girl & a Pizza Place Rita Rocks Legit) and Carla Jimenez (Raising Hope Nacho Libre Desperate Housewives) along with writer/creator Joey Adams (Bones Body of Proof Broadway) as Nate.\nWere running out of time Adams says. If you care about equality empowering women fighting ageism or if youre just a fan of good T.V. we need you to support this show. Sirtis says This is an opportunity to change how older women are portrayed on television. She adds Viewers have the power to make it so.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T17:57:41.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
