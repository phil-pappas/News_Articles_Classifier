That trend will continue into this weekend as strong wind shear remains absent and Dujuan churns northwestward over the warm waters of the Philippine Sea.\nDujuan is expected to become a typhoon later Friday and intensify to the strength of a Category 3 hurricane by Sunday. It is even possible for Dujuan to reach Category 4 hurricane strength later in the weekend.\nThrough the first part of this weekend, the increasing wind and rain around Dujuan will stay well away from land and pose hazards to only shipping interests. However, seas will build throughout the Philippine Sea and residents on the southern Ryukyu Islands should be rushing to complete preparations for the impending typhoon and heed evacuation orders.\nThose across the rest of the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan and eastern China should closely monitor the progress of Dujuan and be prepared to take any necessary precautions. The final stages of Dujuan may eventually pose a flood risk to mainland Japan and South Korea.\nDujuan will near the southern Ryukyu Islands by Sunday and Sunday night, stated AccuWeather Meteorologist Rob Richards. This includes the islands of Miyako and Yaeyama, the latter bore the brunt of Typhoon Goni about a month ago.\n“[The southern Ryukyu Islands] can expect heavy rain to move in along with damaging sustained winds of up to 160 kph (100 mph) possibly,” Richards said. Flooding is a serious concern, along with dangerously rough seas and low-lying coastal flooding.\nEven stronger destructive winds will threaten the islands if they endure a direct hit by Dujuan’s eyewall, where the strongest winds of a typical system are located.\nOkinawa should escape the worst of Dujuan unless it takes a turn more to the north than currently expected.\nThe scenarios for Dujuan after it tracks through the Ryukyu Islands range from the future typhoon maintaining its northwestward track toward northern Taiwan and eastern China or turning northeastward and causing mainland Japan to brace for impacts around Tuesday and Wednesday of next week. Latest indications favor the first solution unfolding.\nIn this scenario, cities from Taipei, Taiwan, to Shanghai, China, may face or be grazed with heavy rain and damaging winds during the first part of next week.\nThe exact track and strength of Dujuan will determine the extent of the damaging wind threat in Taiwan and eastern China. The cooler waters of the southern East China Sea will likely cause Dujuan to weaken during its approach, which may spare some communities from the danger.\nOn the other hand, as Dujuan approaches the coast it may also decrease its forward speed. The result could mean more rain and a heightened flood risk for a given location.\nEven if Dujuan heads toward eastern China, mainland Japan may not totally escape all impacts from Dujuan. Moisture from the future typhoon could still interact with a frontal boundary to cause heavy rain to spread across western Japan early next week.\nAsia Weather Overview\nLater next week, Dujuan may track farther into eastern China but could instead take a turn to the northeast and threaten more of mainland Japan and even South Korea with potentially flooding rain as a non-tropical system.\nAccuWeather will continue to provide updates and more details on the projected track of Dujuan and hazards to life and property.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T11:40:55.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
