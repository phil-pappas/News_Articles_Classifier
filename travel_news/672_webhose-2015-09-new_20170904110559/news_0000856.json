This happened at the World Routes conference in Durban, where airlines from all over the world rated Copenhagen Airport best ahead of the airports in Abu Dhabi, Brussels, Dublin, Munich and Vienna.\nIt’s extremely important to Copenhagen and to Denmark that the airlines have once again rated us the world’s best airport at route development. This is recognition of our extensive marketing efforts to develop and present business cases to airlines, and I am proud and honoured that we have now won the title as the world’s best twice and have been nominated as many as three times,” said Thomas Woldbye, CEO of Copenhagen Airports A/S.\nRoutes generate growth\nPreviously, a report from Copenhagen Economics has shown that an international air route has an economic value of up to DKK 200 million, partly because it attracts more business and leisure travellers to the country. Most recently, a report from Oxford Research shows that a realisation of Copenhagen Airport’s growth vision, Expanding CPH, about growth in the number of routes corresponding to 40 million passengers at Copenhagen Aiport would potentially create up to 84,000 new jobs in Denmark as a whole. In other words: The economic significance of international air routes is enormous. For this reason, Copenhagen Airport is continually focusing on attracting new routes to Denmark.\nInternational air routes generate growth, jobs and investment. As a consequence, competition among airports to attract new routes has intensified over the past 10-15 years. We therefore see it as a fantastic recognition that we have now twice been rated the world’s best at route development in the past three years,” said Ole Wieth Christensen, Director of Airline Sales & Route Development for Copenhagen Airport.\nRated by airlines\n“One of the reasons we appreciate this award so much is that the airlines do the rating. It is an indication that the airlines consider our research, route data and proposals for the development of new and existing routes to be very useful,” said Ole Wieth Christensen.\nThe 21st World Routes conference is currently taking place in Durban. The conference is an annual event at which some 2,500 delegates from 250 airlines, 650 airports and 170 tourism organisations worldwide meet to discuss the development of new air routes.\nSource:- Copenhagen Airline", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T15:31:43.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
