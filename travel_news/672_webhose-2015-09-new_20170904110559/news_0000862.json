In addition to his busy schedule of public appearances in promotion of the new movie, Bedi graciously accepted the Tourism Development Company’s invitation to tour some places of interest in Trinidad. His itinerary included visits to the Temple in the Sea, the Caroni Bird Sanctuary, the 85 feet-tall Hanuman Murti, the city of Port of Spain and of course, the world-famous Maracas Bay. \nBazodee is one of the films being featured at the Trinidad and Tobago Film Festival 2015. The movie, set in Trinidad, features Machel Montano as Lee, a rugged soca singer who falls in love with Anita, the daughter of Bede’s character, Ram – a secretly deep-in-debt businessman. Anita meets Lee, who is performing at her engagement party and sparks fly. Soon, the two fall in love. Nikhil, Anita’s malevolent, future brother-in-law, notices. Once he discovers the truth about Ram’s finances, he threatens to expose everything, forcing Anita to fight for the wealth that truly matters—love. \nBedi, who has also achieved success in Hollywood and Europe’s film industry, is most noted for his role as the villain Gobinda in the 1983 James Bond film, Octopussy and as Emperor Shah Jahan in the movie Taj Mahal. Since 1982, he has been a voting member of the prestigious Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, who are responsible for presenting the Oscar awards. He is also a voting member of the Screen Actors Guild. \nHome to the largest Carnival celebration in the Caribbean, Trinidad & Tobago is the southernmost Caribbean nation located seven miles east off the Venezuelan coast.
