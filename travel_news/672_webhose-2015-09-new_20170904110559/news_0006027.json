The UAE also currently leads the region for hotel construction to meet demand.” \nShe continued: “Saudi currently leads the market for visitor attractions, however, with US $ 4.6 billion in revenues forecast for 2015 versus US $ 638 million for the UAE. But with massive leisure development currently underway across the UAE including 5 theme parks, 3 major museums and 2 safari parks, its visitor attraction revenues are forecast to almost double to US $ 1.2 billion by 2019. As more developments enter the pipeline, including last month’s announcement of the record-breaking Meydan One project featuring the world’s largest indoor ski slope, the UAE’s future for leisure and entertainment tourism looks exceedingly good.” \nThe Hotel Show and The Leisure Show Dubai 2015 have new features this year reflecting the region’s evolving hospitality and leisure landscape.

One of the leading global interiors and contracting companies for hotel interiors and The Hotel Show’s Interiors Partner for 2015, S&T, is unveiling a new brand and a unique design and build fit-out concept with an official unveiling on the second day of the event. \nMr. K.S. Ravikumar, Executive Director - International Operations at S&T said: “The Hotel Show Dubai 2015 is a great networking platform and participating in it only supplements your existence in the industry. The hospitality industry is increasingly seeing the use of modern materials like glass, steel etc. while the use of wood and traditional finishes is getting confined to public areas.
