But it is not always easy. Discovering that hours of flight time and hundreds or thousands of pounds have given you no additional benefits can be deeply disappointing. The challenge for many frequently flying business people is to ensure that their flight qualifies them for rewards. Scale that up for a travel manager potentially booking a dozen flights a month, and the rewards could soon add up. British Airways’ On Business is one example of how busy travel managers can ensure that whenever and wherever their colleagues are flying, the points are in the bag. British Airways’ customers can earn On Business Points when flying with British Airways, American Airlines and Iberia, and on three of the world’s largest airlines it would have to be a highly unusual business trip to require a flight that is not covered. The challenge for many frequently flying business people is to ensure that their flight qualifies them for rewards British Airways flies to more than 170 destinations worldwide while American Airlines covers nearly 350 destinations in more than 50 countries. Iberia, meanwhile, flies to 120 destinations in 45 countries. As a result, the flight booker can focus on simply getting the flights, rather than juggling carriers and routes to get the best value from multiple airlines’ loyalty programmes. The fast pace of the international marketplace is perhaps one reason for the growth of corporate loyalty programmes. The process for business owners and travel bookers is now a world away from even 10 years ago, with simplified booking portals and management tools able to report clearly not only on rewards accumulated but even breakdowns for points earned by individuals and teams. Even with some modern advances in data management, it is a lot to juggle, and that is where the benefit of travelling on a network of large, reputable carriers comes in. Checked baggage with partner airlines make it easier for travellers and their possessions to transfer between flights, and missed connections can be more easily resolved with a seat on a partner’s flight, when available. On Business provides unrivalled service, great savings and access to a worldwide network of destinations – this means businesspeople can spend more time focusing on their relationships overseas rather than the logistics of how they will be getting there. • Find out more about how your company can make savings on business travel by visiting British Airways On Business", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T17:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T12:43:18.745+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
