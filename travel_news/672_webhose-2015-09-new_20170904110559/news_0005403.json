Earlier this year it agreed to sell the holding to IAG as part of the British Airways owner's £1billion takeover of Aer Lingus.\nOffloading: Ryanair agreed to sell its Aer Lingus holding to IAG earlier this year\nRyanair said it would distribute the proceeds, some £295million, to shareholders this year.\nIt brings the amount handed back to Ryanair investors to £590million, and a total of £2.4billion since 2008 – and caps the airline's sterling summer.\nThe company increased its annual profit expectations by 25 per cent earlier this month following a bumper holiday season that saw it take more UK travellers across Europe.\nAirlines are enjoying tailwinds caused by the global oil price dip.\nFuel costs are a major factor affecting airlines' razor-thin margins.
