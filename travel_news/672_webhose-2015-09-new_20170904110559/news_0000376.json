Whether you are 80lbs or 400lbs, it will take you there!\n\"We are putting the final touches on our app which runs on Android and OS. We've also just added Turbo mode and Off road mode,\" says Aldo Baiocchi , CTO and founder of Daymak. \"Most ebikes are slow and not exciting enough, but not the Chameleon. Everyone who tries it is impressed by the Turbo mode of this ebike, the cool LED lights that add so much safety, and the great solar charging feature. And it's all controlled on your phone, including the anti-theft feature.\"\nThe Chameleon Turbo Ebike requires no insurance or license, and is able to reach speeds of 32 km/hr, regardless of the weight of the rider. It has enough power to carry up to 400 lbs on steep inclines. The ebike is considered a power assisted bicycle and is fully loaded with features such as an alarm system, hydraulic disc brakes, front lights, brake lights, signals, key ignition, double kick stand, pedal system, horn and dual mirrors.\nThe Chameleon Turbo Ebike is available on Indiegogo starting at the low price of $599 USD plus shipping.\nThe Indiegogo campaign is at:\nhttps://www.indiegogo.com/projects/chameleon-turbo-ebike\nFor additional information please visit:\nhttp://www.daymak.com/chameleon\nAbout Daymak Inc.\nDaymak, a Toronto -based company, incorporated in 2002, is a leading developer and distributor of personal light electric vehicles.
