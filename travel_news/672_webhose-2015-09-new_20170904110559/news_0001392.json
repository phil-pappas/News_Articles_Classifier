Five years ago, the consumer was increasingly ordering from an online supplier, receiving the goods within a few days. Today, they can press a button in their home and expect a fabric softener refill delivered to their door within a few hours. Companies can increase their competitiveness by making supply chains more transparent In this increasingly volatile market, with shrinking product cycles and increasing consumer demands, the supply chain has never been more important to a company’s competitiveness. How can it keep up with the speed of change? Here are four pieces of advice: Don’t fly blind Accenture research shows that only 43 per cent of C-level operations and supply-chain executives have the real-time data that would give them full operational visibility across the entire supply chain, and just 32 per cent can see into the inventories of their suppliers. Without end-to-end supply-chain visibility, you can’t see which growth opportunities you may be missing or take advantage of new ones. Make your supply chain smarter Analytics can help make your supply chain smarter than the competition. Yet Accenture research shows that fully half of C-level operations and supply-chain executives globally report a limited ability to translate large amounts of transactional data into analytical insights. What is more, they cite that limitation as the biggest obstacle to implementing effective supply-chain strategies. Scale to new heights Scalability – the ability to add or shed suppliers or customers and invest in business, as required – is critical in markets in which growing complexity and fragmentation is a top issue. Fifty-one per cent of C-level operations and supply-chain executives say that supply chains characterised by a multitude of partners and numerous geographies are their biggest challenge. Speed as the currency of the future By making supply chains more transparent, predictive, real-time and scalable, companies can move fast to take advantage of growth opportunities, increasing their competitiveness. Agile supply chains are not only better at sensing market shifts more accurately than their competitors (50 per cent versus 22 per cent), they can also allocate product design and manufacturing capacity across their facility network much more quickly and dynamically. (55 per cent versus 23 per cent.) • Ian Truesdale will speak at Supply Fest on how supply chains can enable growth and competitiveness in the digital age.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T20:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:50:56.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
