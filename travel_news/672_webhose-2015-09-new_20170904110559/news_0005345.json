Her two children, ages 9 and 5, had attended the summer program at the school, but for the school year she signed up for only occasional before-school drop-ins.\n“Can I bring my kids?” she asked program supervisor Robin Glassberg.\nRead more What to do with your children while Seattle teachers strike Seattle teachers to go on strike Wednesday Pay varies widely for Washington state teachers Seattle teachers, staff picket outside schools Parents rush to find child care during strike When Glassberg answered that she had room, at least for the first week, Michaelis cheered: “Yea! Robin, you made my week.”\n Glassberg said the program isn’t staffed as fully as during summer, and can take up to 30 children. The school has an enrollment of about 500. But she said many working parents take off the first week of school to help with their children’s transition, and she didn’t expect a big crush unless the strike continues for a second week.\nMany working parents enrolled, before the strike began, in before- and after-school programs, and many of those were extended because of the strike. Those without a guaranteed spot turned to community centers, which were accepting some children on a space-available basis, as well as some school-based child-care programs with openings.\nAt Miller Community Center on Capitol Hill, Miriam Roskin dropped off her 10-year-old son. Usually he attends before- and after-school care at Montlake Community Center, but those children were redirected to Miller because of more indoor space, she said.\nShe was headed to her job with the city of Seattle housing office and praised city officials for stepping up to open community centers during the strike.\n“I’m so grateful to the city for doing this,” Roskin said. “What would we do if they hadn’t provided this backstop?”\nDavid Takami, spokesman for the Seattle Parks and Recreation, which operates the community centers, said that as of 7:45 a.m., 676 of 892 available registration slots were taken.\nSpace was available at many community centers, but Meadowbrook, Northgate, Ravenna-Eckstein, Queen Anne and Hiawatha were full.\nWhere to send your children Youth day camps : Many community organizations are offering camps and other programs for Seattle students in their areas. Seattle Parks and Recreation after-school programs will expand into day camps Sept. 9-11.\nTeen centers : The city’s Garfield, Meadowbrook and Southwest Teen Life Centers will open at 11 a.m., two hours earlier than usual.\nLibraries will be open regular hours and offer their usual slate of programs for children and teens.\nAthletics : “At this point,” the plan is for athletic practices and events to continue as normal, according to the district’s website.\nPreschool : City preschool programs are canceled during the strike. Affected families can call 206-386-1050 for help finding child care.\nGo here for more details.\nLynn Thompson: lthompson@seattletimes.com or 206-464-8305.
