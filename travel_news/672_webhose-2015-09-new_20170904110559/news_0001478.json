It was created to prevent big businesses that have established headquarters in lower-VAT regimes from profiting unfairly, but its inventors failed to anticipate the impact on small companies. Suddenly, UK-based micro-businesses selling digital products such as e-books or online tuition found themselves embroiled in a fiscal fiasco. Whereas previously they were protected by an £82,000 UK VAT threshold, suddenly they were forced to pay VAT on every sale from Europe. The new law affects thousands of sole traders, who have been left with three choices: spend hours registering for VAT MOSS in order to pay – often just pennies – in VAT for the odd EU order; risk the consequences of non-compliance; or begin refusing sales from the Continent, a practice now known as geo-blocking. The European Commission made it clear that it supports proposals to introduce a threshold to exempt the smallest businesses from the rules After months of campaigning, and even an intervention from David Cameron in March, the European Commission recently made it clear that it supports proposals to introduce a threshold to exempt the smallest businesses from the rules. So does this mean that the nightmare is over? Hell, no. I caught up with Richard Asquith, a global tax expert at compliance firm Avalara, who was present at Fiscalis, the recent meeting of European tax authorities, to get the inside track on what is in store for businesses affected by VAT MOSS. “Everyone is calling this a victory,” he says, referring to the proposed introduction of a threshold. “But there are two difficulties: practicality and timing.” It will be at least two years before a threshold can be introduced, he explains; this is the minimum notice that can be given by the tax authorities when implementing a change. “We won’t see anything before 2018 and there is a risk it could slip to 2020,” Mr Asquith tells me. The practicality issue is more pressing: most countries in the EU will only accept a threshold of between €10,000 and €20,000 euros (up to £14,500), while the UK is demanding a £100,000 limit. “Almost all the other EU countries don’t want a threshold,” Mr Asquith says. “In Germany, the VAT threshold is just €17,500, but in Italy there’s no threshold at all. There’s a greater fear of fraud in Europe, where there’s a larger black market than in the UK, so authorities prefer to charge VAT on everything. It’s a cultural issue.” The introduction of a threshold also opens up a kind of VAT fraud called splitting, whereby a business owner, once they are approaching a threshold, will simply launch a new venture and split the sales between the two companies. It is very hard to spot and is a major reason why the EU has blocked a threshold. The UK stands almost alone in its rebellion against VAT MOSS – 95pc of the complaints regarding the regime come from this country. This is because the UK accounts for the largest share of digital services in Europe with the exception of the US. Proposals will be drawn up by the end of this year, and until then micro-firms will be left in limbo. The issue is continuing to undermine the whole digital single market, and is stifling international growth as UK firms block EU customers from accessing services. Yes, the Commission is listening – but this battle is far from won. • For more advice on preparing your business for the tech challenges of the future, visit HP BusinessNow You may also be interested in: • My First Startup aims to inspire young entrepreneurs • How to pitch to a Silicon Valley Venture Capitalist • Set your people free with the ultimate in flexible working • Confessions of a crowdfunder • MPs unaware of Government help for small businesses", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T00:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T20:41:01.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
