As well as this, they have also announced that May 2016 will mark the opening of ROBINSON Club Masmavi, the fifth Turkish ROBINSON Club. \nThe all-inclusive ‘Made by Robinson’ resort sits directly on a pristine white sand beach, lapped by the Mediterranean Sea in the stunning Turkish Riviera. Located close to the resort of Belek, the new resort offers a laid-back, authentically Turkish experience only 35 km from the bustling resort of Antalya. Whether guests are water sports enthusiasts, budding tennis, football or golf players or sunbathing superstars, they will be spoilt for choice; not forgetting the main pool which boasts 8 slides, the infectiously entertaining nightly shows and the Roby and ROBS kids clubs for children aged between 3-17. After all that excitement, guests can opt for some well deserved pampering at the WellFit® Spa or head to one of the resort’s spectacular on-site restaurants before heading back to one of the 570 modern rooms. With all of the above to choose from, Club Masmavi offers up the perfect balance between activity, enjoyment and relaxation that ROBINSON are famous for. This is an exciting time for the ROBINSON Group and another step forward in their bid to expand their international client profile; as successfully as they have built up their German market leadership in the last 40 years. CEO of Robinson Club GmbH, Dr Ingo Burmester, said about the expansion: “We are pleased that we can respond to the growing demand of our guests with the fifth ROBINSON Club in Turkey. Turkey is one of our most popular destinations and the addition of Club Masmavi makes for a total of 4,820 ROBINSON Club beds in Turkey. This excitement follows the opening of five new clubs in Morocco, Egypt, Portugal, Majorca and Fuerteventura to the UK market in 2015.\" Each ROBINSON Club resort provides an impressive variety of activities in an informal yet sophisticated setting with inspired regional cuisine and top quality accommodation in prime holiday locations with easy flight access from the UK.
