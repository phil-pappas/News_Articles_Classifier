After a quick waxing and tweezing, she emerged tidied up and ready to go—straight to the gate, to board her flight.\nMs. Neumann, a London digital marketing strategist, was at the Benefit BrowBar in Terminal 2 at Australia’s Sydney International Airport. Aside from the hordes of fliers passing by, the grooming experience was the same one that Benefit Cosmetics, a San Francisco makeup brand, offers at its traditional locations. “You’re definitely in the middle of the terminal,” Ms. Neumann said. “But it was still a full brow treatment.”\nIncreasingly, airports are vying to be your go-to beauty destination. As they transition from transportation hubs to full-on shopping malls with chic boutiques, name-brand retailers and restaurants affiliated with celebrity chefs, more airports also are welcoming spa and salon businesses that help passengers glam up, too. The newest on-the-fly beauty services go well beyond the typical chair. Travelers at Chicago O’Hare can choose a walk-in or pre-booked “back facial” (an upper-back acne treatment) at the recently renovated Terminal Getaway Spa. LaGuardia fliers can try a shine-enhancing hair glaze and blowout at WT GO, a spinoff of the upscale New York salon Warren-Tricomi that opened in January. Meanwhile, men seeking old-school pampering can pop into the two-year-old barbershop at Buffalo Niagara International Airport for a hot-towel shave and a few minutes in the chair.\nNot exotic enough for you? Try a fish pedicure at Wellness Oasis at Singapore’s Changi Airport, which involves plunging one’s feet into a pool full of callous-munching fish. Or, if you decide your bikini line needs immediate tending, “We’re ready, and the wax is hot,” said Adeline Moya, vice president of business development at Be Relax, a French chain with 38 locations world-wide including airports in North America, the Middle East and Southeast Asia (its name is a slightly awkward translation of a French idiom).\nBeauty is just the latest development in the continuing evolution of airports that began after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when heightened security measures required travelers to arrive much earlier than they had before. After the security logjam comes the seemingly endless wait known in airport-speak as “dwell time,” a perfect opportunity for businesses to find profitable ways to amuse their concourse captives. The travel and retail industries are hoping to grab a piece of the $439 billion “Wellness Tourism” market, a travel category that includes beauty and which in 2013 grew at a faster rate than tourism overall, according to a study by the Global Wellness Institute, a Miami industry group.\n“We are an alternative to other indulgences,” said Rhonda Schladerbach, Chief Operating Officer of XpresSpa, whose 48s outposts in 20 airports (most in North America) offer services that can include facial-hair trims for men, blowouts, long-wearing gel manicures and pedicures, shower facilities, and stress-busting backrubs. Founded in 2004, XpresSpa is the largest airport-spa chain. But, said Ms. Schladerbach, the real competition isn’t other airport beauty providers but other entertainment options: “Customers are saying, ‘Should I grab a cocktail or get a massage?’ ”\nThis year, XpresSpa has added seven new spots at various airports. Meanwhile, its competitor, Be Relax will have 11 new locations by the end of 2015, including Boston Logan, Toronto Pearson and Washington Dulles. A 3,000-square-foot branch with a hammam is slated to open at Dubai International Airport in early 2016. Retail stores are getting in on the trend, too: Estée Lauder last year opened a 5,320-square-foot boutique at Detroit Metropolitan Airport; aside from selling its brands’ products, the store includes services like the “Arrive Hydrated” skin-care consultation, which uses products from the prestige line La Mer. Benefit recently discontinued its Sydney Airport brow service but still does brows at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, Malaysia, and Auckland Airport, New Zealand.\nFliers can also go the do-it-yourself route with beauty vending machines, which started showing up at airports about two years ago and have only multiplied since. Vending machines from 3FLOZ dispense travel-size beauty and grooming items, while Benefit Cosmetics’ “Glam Up & Away” kiosks sell mascara, blush and lip color and have mirrors on the side so travelers can touch up right after buying. Nail-polish brand Essie has vending machines at five U.S. airports, letting bored travelers give themselves manis at the gate.\nProviders of airport beauty face challenges beyond competing with bars for attention and defusing potential customers’ fear of missing their flights. Clients can be deeply loyal to their regular beauty professionals and loath to try someone new. Some travelers wonder whether airport spas and salons have to abide by state-regulated sanitation and licensing requirements. (Not to worry; they do.)\nTravelers also often assume beauty services at airports cost more than those on the outside. That isn’t necessarily the case. Blowouts at WT GO in the XpresSpa in La Guardia’s Terminal C run $45 to $95 (the pricier version includes the glaze treatment); blowouts at Warren-Tricomi’s regular salons are $65 to $100. A basic XpresSpa manicure costs $30, about a third more than the national average, but a haircut at the Old Fashioned Barber Shop at Buffalo Niagara is just $15—which might explain why some regular clients are locals who drive to the airport for a cut.\nStill, some services just don’t fly. At Terminal Getaway Spa, which has locations in Chicago, Orlando and Charlotte, the most popular service remains that old airport standard: A 20-minute, $42 chair massage. Women business travelers tend to decline facials, because they’re already made up for the day, said Marko Iglendza, the chain’s founder and CEO. Nor does Terminal Getaway offer blowouts. “Say you’re flying to a meeting,” Mr. Iglendza said. “Would you really go to the airport to have your hair blown out? You might be late; there might be traffic. Would you really risk it?”\nDuring a recent layover at Minneapolis-St. Paul International, Julie Klam wanted a blowout, but decided against it after she saw the work of the stylists at the airport spa. “It was very Midwestern,” said the New York author. “A woman was getting an updo with little ringlets. I was like, ‘No, I don’t want these people blowing out my hair.’ ” Ms. Klam had a manicure instead and considers the layover well spent. “There are two things you can do to waste time in an airport: get drunk or get your nails done,” she said. “I didn’t think arriving where I was going drunk was going to work.”\n ", "external_links": ["http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fAAea2pn%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fAAe9ZUY.img&description=Provided+by+The+Wall+Street+Journal.", "http://online.wsj.com/"], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T22:35:04.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
