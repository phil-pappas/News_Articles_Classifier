But significant research suggests that grooming has real value – from both an emotional and practical perspective. The way we look has a huge bearing on how others perceive us. For example, a number of studies have shown that a patient’s confidence in doctors is affected by what they wear – business wear and formal clothing generally inspire more confidence than casual clothing. Other research shows that women who wear a moderate amount of make-up are judged to be more competent than those wearing none. Perhaps it’s not surprising. After all, if you’re dressed smartly and are wearing make-up, you’re conveying that you’ve judged the situation correctly and are organised enough to maintain a polished look. That might be why academics at UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles), discovered that 55 per cent of first impressions are based on appearance alone. As we’ve tried to cram more and more into our lives, we’ve seen a commensurate increase in levels of stress and burnout And because our perception of ourselves – and consequently our self-esteem – is, in part, constructed from the way that other people behave towards us, it makes sense to invest care and attention in how you look – because it will make you feel better as well as look better. Furthermore, the time you spend on yourself is important, and needs to be prioritised. New research carried out by Sanctuary Spa has found that 60 per cent of women don’t feel that they get enough time for themselves, and at least a third don’t feel that they have their work-life balance right. “In the 21st century we have become overly attached to our busyness; ‘busy’ and ‘stressed’ have somehow become inextricably linked with success,” says life coach Jenni Trent- Hughes. “In order to be successful we need to let go of these antiquated attitudes. Think of it as pulling a wagon behind you. The more that is in the wagon the harder it is to pull, the more tired you will be and the less distance you will cover.” She believes that it’s no coincidence that as we’ve tried to cram more and more into our lives, we’ve seen a commensurate increase in levels of stress and burnout. “We need to realise that ‘me time’ is not selfish, it’s a necessity. People have got to understand that doing this stuff is no longer a luxury. We have got to calm down. We have to stop and do things for ourselves, and we have got to let go of things that we don’t need to be clinging on to.” So, where do you start? Here are four ways to invest in you... 1. Freshen up your wardrobe Throw out what you don’t wear and what doesn’t suit or fit and see a personal shopper to find a new look. 2. Have a blow-dry, a manicure or professional shave Having someone else do something you normally do for yourself – and doing it better – is a refreshing change. 3. Go for a massage It is proven to reduce physical and mental stress – however, if you can’t manage that, a long soak in a hot bath will have a similar de-stressing effect. 4. Have a makeover Visit a cosmetics counter and ask what sort of look they’d suggest – updating your make-up can instantly transform you. How what you look like counts • Psychology studies show that first impressions are formed within seven to 17 seconds of meeting someone • Attractive people earn an average of three or four per cent more than people with below- average looks. • Women with blonde hair are perceived as being more needy than brunettes. • Tall men in their mid-30s with masculine features are perceived as more dominant than other men. • 93 per cent of people’s judgments of others are based on non- verbal input, such as how you stand, sit and shake hands.
