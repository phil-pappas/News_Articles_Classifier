But there are a bunch of characters, cartoon and otherwise, you can meet on cruise ships. Most do not chat, but rather are shipboard to see and be seen, posing for photos and appearing at such events as character breakfasts. The characters may elicit squeals of delight from kids, and some adults too. \nNot all are cute and cuddly. For instance, on the sold out Walker Stalker theme cruise on Norwegian Pearl in January, there will be zombies walking around. We suspect Darth Vader, who will be on select Disney Fantasy cruises beginning in January, won’t be especially cuddly either. Unfortunately SpongeBob and Dora the Explorer are retiring from shipboard life – Nickelodeon TV’s contract with Norwegian Cruise Line is up at the end of the year. But other characters are very much a part of the shipboard scene. \nHere are our favorites. \nMickey Mouse: There are a lot of opportunities to meet Mickey Mouse, and Minnie Mouse too, on Disney ships. You’ll see them often, in various outfits (pirate attire one day, beach outfits the next), participating in a bunch of activities both onboard and onshore (including at Disney’s private Bahamas island, Castaway Cay). Donald Duck, Goofy, Chip ‘n’ Dale, Captain Hook and other popular Disney characters make appearances too. \nDisney Princesses: It’s an “ah” moment whenever the princesses appear on Disney ships, whether they are descending a grand staircase, greeting passengers in a dining room or starring in show productions. Belle, perhaps because of her beautiful dress, seems to command special attention, along with Cinderella and Ariel. For photo sessions in the atrium, timed (complimentary) tickets are now required. \nQueen Elsa: Meet Elsa and her sister Anna from “Frozen” on Disney Cruise Line ships as they appear at a special photo session. Timed tickets (complimentary) are required and you can get them onboard (check your Personal Navigator for ticket distribution locations). There’s also a “Frozen” Day at Sea with character appearances and movie-related activities on select sailings of the Disney Wonder. \nJack Sparrow: Captain Jack from “Pirates of the Caribbean” is on Disney ships, long dreadlocks, eye makeup, whiskers, boots and all. He’s actually a little creepy but it’s hard to resist giving him a hug. \nCaptain America: Exclusively on the Disney Magic, kids can do super hero training at the Marvel’s Avengers Academy. The high-tech setup includes opportunity to wear, on a virtual basis, one of Iron Man’s suits. Captain America makes a surprise visit – and also poses with guests during a photo session. \nDarth Vader: Okay, we admit we’re excited about this one. During a “Star Wars” Day At Sea on select Disney Fantasy sailings this winter and spring, Darth will be doing meet and greets with passengers. The ship will also have a “Star Wars” themed deck party, kids’ activities and themed beverage and food offerings and will host the only at-sea screenings of Episode VII (coming to land-based theaters December 18). \nChewbacca: Come on, how can you not love it? Chewbacca will be in the house during “Star Wars” Day at Sea cruises on the Disney Fantasy and so will Boba Fett and Stormtroopers. Lightsabers and other Episode VII merchandise are already for sale in the line’s shipboard shops. \nShrek: The loveable big green ogre hangs out on select Royal Caribbean ships as part of the cruise line’s partnership with DreamWorks Animation. Just announced: He’ll be onboard Anthem of the Seas when the Quantum-class ship begins sailing from its new homeport of Bayonne, New Jersey in November. Princess Fiona, the Penguins from “Madagascar,” and Po, “the Kung Fu Panda” are among others making appearances. \nThe Cat in the Hat: This mischievous cat in a tall red and white hat appears on Carnival Cruise Line ships. As part of the line’s Seuss at Sea program, he leads a Seuss-A-Palooza parade through the main promenade (kids and adults can borrow props and join in) that culminates in the theater with a participatory Story Time reading of the Cat-starring classic children’s book. \nSam I Am: This yellow, furry Dr. Seuss character appears in the Seuss-A-Palooza parade and headlines a “Green Eggs and Ham” breakfast ($5) on Carnival ships. Thing 1 and Thing 2 and The Cat in the Hat join the breakfast fun too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T01:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T05:10:48.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
