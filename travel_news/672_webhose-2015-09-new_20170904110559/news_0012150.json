Many people plan their vacations around the changing of the season, so they can watch the leaves turn colors and enjoy hot cider, but for a truly memorable seasonal experience, now is the time to book your vacation for Key West to enjoy the end of hurricane season. Hurricane season runs for six months of the year, from June 1st through November 30th. This is a particularly stressful time for the island residents, especially during the typically busiest storm months of the year, August, September and October. Naturally, when the threat of these tropical disasters ends, people of Key West - not that they ever really need one - use it as a reason to celebrate. The end of these threats is one of many good reasons why a tropical island destination vacation is a smart choice for that time of year. Coming so quickly after Thanksgiving and just a few short weeks before the holiday season ramps up, early December is a typically slow travel month. That means you will have your pick of your favorite Key West restaurants as well as the choicest hotel accommodations on the island. Smaller crowds means less waiting time in general for all of the activities that Key West has to offer, so even if you only have a few days to get away, you will still be able to enjoy much of the island. That includes all the beautiful water that surrounds it as well. It may be getting close to winter on the calendar but the water is still abundantly warm from all that summertime heat, making it the perfect temperature for snorkeling on the only barrier reef in North America or feeling the spray from a Jet Ski tour. It is also one of the best times to taste all of the amazing seafood that restaurants in Key West Florida are known for, with lobster, stone crab and so many other delicious choices on their menus. Finally, the slower time of year means more chances to spend time getting to know the people of the island. Ask anyone who has traveled to a tropical island and they will tell you that one of the highlights of the trip was meeting people and learning about the experience of living on an island. If you are planning a seasonal vacation this fall, skip over the ordinary and take a trip to the extraordinary. Join in the burning of the hurricane flag in Key West, Florida and be a part of one of the happiest celebrations of the year. \nJack Terry is a freelance writer who, after spending one year experiencing four hurricanes, knows how exciting the end of hurricane season is in Key West. http://www.rooftopcafekeywest.com/   05 Sep   29  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T06:07:06.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
