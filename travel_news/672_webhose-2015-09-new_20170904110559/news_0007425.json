Here we consider whether to book Prague Airport transfers before you travel. \nAirport transfers are a great way to reach your final destination or to make a connection during your journey. They can be a real boon when your journey would otherwise involve complicated changes via multiple forms of transport, and can offer comfort when chosen over the option of a crowded train or bus. Here we consider whether Prague airport transfers are a good option for you when visiting this amazing city. \nAre You Flying? \nWhereas for many cities, flying is the primary method of travel for any sort of distance, Prague is one of Europe’s most railway-accessible cities. You can reach Russia, Croatia, Germany, Slovakia, Poland, Switzerland or Hungary via rail (as well as, of course, other Czech destinations). So, of course, you may not need to make use of Prague airport transfers, because you might choose not to travel by air; plenty of people enjoy travelling by train and are willing to take a little extra time to do so. However, if your itinerary involves flying into the city and taking the train elsewhere (or vice versa), Prague airport transfers are useful. \nDo You Need to Consider a Disability? \nAs those living with disabilities will know, public transport can often be a problem. For example, buses may be difficult to board or to ride comfortably, especially at busy times, whereas station platforms may not be accessible to those with restricted mobility, such as wheelchair users. \nPrague certainly encounters such problems, with only four wheelchair-accessible stations in the city centre, and those with physical disabilities may encounter difficulties with steep cobbled streets. If a disability that affects your ability to travel, or you are travelling with somebody who may have such a disability, transport is something that has to be carefully considered. In this case, Prague airport transfers may be helpful, although the problem of accessibility during day-to-day sightseeing and travel must also be kept in mind before booking a holiday. \nWhen Does Your Flight Land? \nPrague Airport is only connected to the city by bus, and the buses stop at 11:40 pm. While reaching the city is still technically possible through a combination of night buses and complicated connections with trams, it’s far from ideal. So if you are flying in late at night or very early in the morning you’d be wise to book an airport transfer rather than having to brave a two-hour trek in the middle of the night to your hotel. \nIs there Room in Your Budget? \nIn an ideal world, most travellers do prefer to take private, comfortable transportation from the airport to their hotel. However, public transport is almost always cheaper, meaning that budget can be a deciding factor. Before booking the holiday, you need to work out priorities (see above: if, for example, you’re travelling with people with restricted mobility then you’ll need to prioritise travel far more than if all of your party has full mobility) and budget accordingly. If Prague airport transfers are within your budget it is by far the best option to get you to and from your accommodation. However, if there isn’t room in your budget, do remember to try to land in the daytime if you’re taking public transport.   from ArticlesFactory.com ABOUT THE AUTHOR \nLukas Johannes is a driver for Shuttle Direct.
