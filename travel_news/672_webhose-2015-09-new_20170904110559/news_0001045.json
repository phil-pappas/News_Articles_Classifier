We have invited them and if they do not want to play then it shouldn’t be any worry, we are still happy.”\nThe last time both teams played a Test series was in 2007 when Pakistan toured India. Pakistan last hosted India for a Test series in 2006.\nShahid Afridi hasn’t played Test cricket since 2010. Source: AFP\nPakistan has scheduled Twenty20 internationals against Zimbabwe, England and New Zealand ahead of the World Twenty20 tournament in India next March and April, after which Afridi has said he will quit playing the shortest cricket format. Afridi has already stopped playing ODIs following Pakistan’s loss in the quarter-finals of the Cricket World Cup in Australia in March.\nPakistan cricket selectors have included rookie left-arm fast bowler Imran Khan Jr. and offspinner Bilal Asif for the two Twenty20s against Zimbabwe later this month in order to start getting ready for next year’s event in India.\n“The idea is to try out new players and there are number of players who impressed me in National Twenty20 tournament this week,” Afridi said.\nIn May, Zimbabwe became the first Test nation to tour Pakistan since 2009, when gunmen attacked the Sri Lanka team bus. The Zimbabweans played three ODIs and two Twenty20s in Lahore.\nWith top-level international cricket a rarity in Pakistan, Afridi said it would have been better if the Pakistan Cricket Board had decided to host next February’s inaugural Twenty20 Pakistan Super League at home instead of choosing Doha, Qatar, as the venue.\n“It would have been great had it been organised in Pakistan because we were talking about revival of cricket in Pakistan after the tour of Zimbabwe,” he said.\n“Our players would have benefited more had it been organised in Pakistan. I am not worried whether foreign players come or not, but at least the crowd will come and our own youngsters get an opportunity.”\n Afridi plea: stop pushing for India series", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/shahid-afridi-urges-pakistan-to-stop-pushing-for-much-publicised-test-series-against-india/story-e6frf3g3-1227534495238", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/09/19/1227534/491903-c5bdacee-5e5f-11e5-91f0-4e0a229b6d15.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-19T17:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T04:26:42.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
