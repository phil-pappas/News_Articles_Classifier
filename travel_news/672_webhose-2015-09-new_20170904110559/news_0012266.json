Long story short Im married with no children and me and my wife are both Canadian citizen. Due to some unforseen circumstances beyond my control I ended up having a fling with a girl in India and we had sex and now she is pregnant. I simply fell for temptations being a mere mortal after all. Im trying to own up to my mistake so that she does not face the stigma of being an unwed mother. My parents have agreed to care for the baby (when born) and some day I would like to see this child immigrate to Canada. Does anybody know if the government grants citizenship to a child born outside of wedlock to a Canadian citizen while abroad if he is already married? Does the child (when born) get Canadian citizenship based on his father?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T00:05:41.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
