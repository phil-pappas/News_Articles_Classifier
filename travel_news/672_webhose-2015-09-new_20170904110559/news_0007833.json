Where people would have traveled more than 10 miles to reach a full-service U-Haul, we are now literally in their backyard. We are a friendly staff eager to serve customers the absolute best way we know how. We will always have their best interest at heart when helping to make their move stress-free.\"\nU-Haul Moving & Storage of Starrs Mills will feature a new 5,000-square-foot showroom and an updated warehouse with hitch bays and docking when completed.
