What to do? You could loiter in the bar, linger in an airport lounge, or peruse the perfumes – but having just been liberated from an aircraft seat, chances are you have itchy feet. It’s good news then, for an active executive, that fitness resources are being integrated into airport terminals all over the world in the most imaginative ways. A healthy body means a healthy mind, so if you should find yourself at Qatar’s Hamad International Airport, then head to the Vitality & Wellbeing Fitness Centre , which houses a 25m indoor swimming pool, a fully equipped gym (with fitness instructor) plus squash courts (with racquets, balls and shoes provided). Business travellers at a loose end in Zurich can rent bikes, inline skates or Nordic walking sticks to explore the greenery around the airport, while at Schiphol in Amsterdam you can ride a stationary bike that will recharge your mobile as you pedal. In the Far East, the facilities become increasingly inventive. At Changi Airport in Singapore, you can take a dip in a rooftop pool overlooking the runway; go ice-skating on a rink made from plastic ice at Korea’s Incheon International Airport; or visit Hong Kong International’s iSports area, which features football, basketball, golf, boxing and skiing simulators, as well as a golf course near Terminal 2 inspired by the 17th hole at the Tournament Players Club at Sawgrass, Florida. Even walking up escalators or stairs in the airport terminal or a simple 10-minute routine in your hotel room is better than nothing In the US, Minneapolis-St Paul International and Cleveland Hopkins International airports both have walking circuits, while the Terminal 3 walkways at Tokyo’s Narita International have been given a makeover to resemble colour-coded running tracks. This could be the perfect place for a power walk, as long as you’re able to dodge other people’s luggage… For those seeking zen-like calm, a free-to-use yoga room is available to ticketed passengers just past the security gate at San Francisco International, while Dallas-Fort Worth International offers a yoga studio between Terminals D and B. And at the British Airways Elemis spas in London Heathrow and JFK, a range of treatments including massages can ease overworked bodies into a state of calm. As an incentive to make use of such health facilities, wellness tourism professional Oliver Roberts says that the consequences of not keeping up with your fitness regime while travelling can be detrimental not just to your wellbeing but also your business objectives. “Even walking up escalators or stairs in the airport terminal or a simple 10-minute routine in your hotel room is better than nothing,” he says. “My advice is to ask the hotel or company you are visiting to hook you up with a ‘business trip training buddy’. It can even double up as a networking opportunity.” Keeping fit on the fly while building client relationships? Business travel will never be the same again. • Find out more about how to receive business travel rewards by visiting British Airways On Business", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T17:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T12:41:27.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
