Tabali, in Chile's Limarí Valley, is located about 80 kilometers from the epicenter of last Wednesday's earthquake, which measured 8.3 on the Richter scale. (Some reports indicated 8.4.) It lasted for three minutes and was the fourth largest in Chile's recorded history but despite that magnitude, Tabali suffered only minimal loss due to barrels of wine becoming dislodged from storage and falling down.That report of minimal damage at wineries is consistent almost across the board, which in itself is noteworthy and is testament to Chile's standards of construction and technology. But it's the resilience of both the infrastructure and the wine community's philosophy that's most striking: Muller and his counterparts take the long view.\"All of these earthquakes have formed our soils, our geography, and the geomorphology of where the vineyards are planted today,\" Müller said. \"We have a vineyard planted in limestone soils, which was the bed of the ocean for millions of years. It was brought up by earthquakes and the natural alluvial phenomena that built our environment, so it's a very interesting country to plant. The earthquakes are not good news, but we as Chileans know that it will happen from time to time.\"Still, the seismic activity seems to be increasing, Müller said, in the last 20-30 years. And, according to Giorgio Flessati of Viña Falernia, last Wednesday's earthquake was followed by after-effects measuring from 6.1 to 7.2. Yesterday, five more after-shocks hit, ranging from 5.5 to 6.6.\"The area is quite often affected by earthquakes,\" Flessati said, \"so for us this is normal. But not with that intensity.\"Even so, most wineries reported minimal damage, including Maycas del Limarí and Quinta de Maipo whose vineyards and production facilities continue to operate normally despite a small amount of damage to its cellars at Nueva Aurora in Ovalle. But at Viña Falernia the impact was greater: about 70 tanks were damaged and they lost close to 1000 hectoliters (more than 130,000 bottles of 750 ml each).Flessati sees it as the risk you have to take in order to make wine in Chile: it's risky, and difficult, to grow grapes and make wine in these conditions, he said, \"but we love it and we want to come back even stronger.\"[caption id=\"attachment_3342\" align=\"\" width=\"900\"] The diversity of Chile's wine landscape, from soils to mountains to altitude, has been shaped by seismic events for millions of years. Photo Credit: Cathy Huyghe[/caption]Chile's political borders shape it into a long and narrow shaft of land that seems to cling to the western edge of South America. The Pacific Ocean is immediately to its west, the Andes Mountains lie to the east, the south is bordered by the Patagonian ice fields, and the Atacama Desert is to the north. Each of those features asserts a powerful environmental impact, but the combination of all four amounts to an almost raucous amount of seismic activity.That activity is reflected in the glass. Chilean wine is known for its diversity of varietals -- from Carmenère to Pinot Noir for reds, and Viognier to Chardonnay for whites -- and the diversity of climates that support them, from some of the coolest of any wine-producing region in the world all the way to a temperate Mediterranean influence.Cathy Huyghe is the author of Hungry for Wine , which will be released next week.
