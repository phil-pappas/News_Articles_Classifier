The company also unveiled its new visual identity which include, among others, the brand, the cabin design and the new livery. \nWhile noting that the economic performance is in line with the plan, the Board of Directors confirmed the turnaround strategy and highlighted the need to carry out its implementation promptly. \nEarly next week the Etihad Airways partnersâ€™ top management will convene in Rome, as previously scheduled, for a further discussion and update meetings on the development of industrial synergies and the networks integration.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T04:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T05:02:04.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
