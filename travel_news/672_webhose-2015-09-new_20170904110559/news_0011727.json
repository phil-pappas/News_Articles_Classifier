Come September, the crowds have thinned, and the second wave of fall foliage tourists have yet to descend. Take advantage of the quiet time to soak in the surrounding in the calm before the new storm. \nThe Algarve, Portugal \nTake advantage of the struggling euro and seasonal discounts with a trip to the southernmost tip of Portugal. During the month of September, the beaches remain sun-soaked and the mercury is still high enough for seaside lounging. Moreover, it’s easier to find seats on waterfront restaurants and terraces, now that the crowds have returned home. \nCancun, Mexico \nWhile a particularly active El Nino season is expected to stir up trouble in the Pacific this year, it’s also keeping the Caribbean and Atlantic relatively cool and calm, with fewer than normal hurricanes forecast for the region, points out Cheapflights. That means decreased odds of having to spend your holidays washed out by gale-force winds and storms during your Mexican vacation. Take advantage of slashed prices, child-free resorts and summer weather at resort towns across Mexico. \nCuba \nThis Caribbean island also fits under the “calm before the storm,” but for reasons that have nothing to do with violent weather systems. Cheapflights advises booking a trip to Cuba before it’s forever transformed by the advent of American tourism. \nRio de Janeiro, Brazil \nWhile summer is on its last legs in the Northern Hemisphere, consider heading across the equator to Brazil, where temperatures are back on the rise after their version of winter. October is classic shoulder season for Rio, points out Cheapflights, with cheaper hotel rates and airfare in advance of Carnival. ― AFP-Relaxnews More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T04:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T05:37:01.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
