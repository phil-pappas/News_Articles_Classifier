But it can happen. Passengers who were scheduled to board a Delta flight from Baltimore to Atlanta thankfully avoided a potential in-flight run-in with a tarantula on Wednesday night.\nDelta Flight 1525 was scheduled to depart Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport at 7 p.m., but before passengers boarded, an employee spotted the spider in the cargo hold. Baggage handlers were unloading the MD-88 aircraft before turning the aircraft for departure to Atlanta when it was spotted.\n“There was a cargo shipment of insects that was breached,” Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant said.\nThe crew was notified, who subsequently made the decision to continue on another aircraft.\n“We have to make the safe decision on that — being bitten by a tarantula is not a good thing,” the pilot said.\nDelta says the spider was never in the cabin or seen by passengers or flight crew.\nThe aircraft in question remained out of service Thursday as it was cleaned and searched.\nPassengers later departed on a different flight at 10 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T05:17:10.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
