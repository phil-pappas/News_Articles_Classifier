The list is public and can also be viewed by police, customs and border security agents, banks and others issuing credit. \nNumerous incidents of bad behavior by tourists abroad, from fighting with air crews to defacing cultural artifacts, have drawn widespread derision in China. That prompted the administration last year to create the list, which now contains 11 names. \nOthers named and shamed have included a couple who poured instant noodles soaked in hot water onto flight attendant and made insults and threats in a dispute over seating. Another opened emergency doors on a domestic flight during a delay and still another had climbed onto statues of revolutionary heroes to have his photo taken. \nRising incomes and cheap flights have permitted record numbers of Chinese to travel domestically and abroad, touring scenic and cultural spots around the world. \nAmong other complaints are line-cutting, smoking in public, littering and fouling public toilets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T02:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T04:10:55.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
