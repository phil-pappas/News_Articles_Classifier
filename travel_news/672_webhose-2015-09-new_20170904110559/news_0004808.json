This central North Carolina town sits on a lofty hill, shaded by ancient oak and poplar trees, a postcard-perfect setting for a weekend getaway or a longer stay. Chapel Hill is home to the nation's first state university, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, with the cornerstone for the first building laid in 1793. The campus is beautiful in autumn and worth a tour. The tree-lined business district has a variety of cultural activities, bookstores, boutique shops and award winning dining. Franklin Street fronts the campus and is a great place for people watching. You can buy everything from to custom jewelry to hip trendy fashions. Dozens of restaurants, music clubs and pubs are open for a great nightlife experience. Before the cooler temperatures arrive; enjoy dining outdoors from Chapel Hill's Franklin Street, Carrboro's Weaver Street Market Lawn to Hillsborough's historic Churton Street. Autumn showcases outdoor food festivals, farm dinners and farmers' markets. Don't miss Chapel Hill's 6th Annual TerraVita Food and Drink Festival, one of the premier culinary events in the Southeast highlighting sustainable food and drink. See award-winning chefs, authors, food artisans and farmers at this three day signature culinary event, October 8-10. Carolina Performing Arts (CPA) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Memorial Hall will present internationally renowned artists alongside emerging artists for its 11th season. Groundbreaking performances in autumn include a production of Antigone directed by Ivo van Hove and featuring Oscar-winning actress Juliette Binoche in a new translation by Canadian poet and essayist Anne Carson on Oct. 9 and 10; an appearance by Cuban rapper and hip-hop musician Danay Suárez on Oct. 29; Japanese butoh dance company Sankai Juku performing on Nov. 6; and You Us We All, a radical new chamber opera by Shara Worden and directed by Andrew Ondrejcak on Nov. 17. Other October fall events include McKee Farm Cornfield maze, Spirits of Hillsborough Tour, Voices from the Grave Cemetery Tours and Halloween carnivals. In November, see area artists at the Orange County Open Studio Tour and don't miss the annual Carrboro Film Festival. If you love the outdoors, drop by the North Carolina Botanical Garden. The largest natural botanical garden in the southeast each fall hosts the \"Sculpture in the Garden\" with nearly 50 one-of-a-kind North Carolina artists' sculptures placed amid the native wildflowers and shrubs delight garden visitors through early December. The sculptures come in a variety of media—from stone to stainless steel, concrete to clay, chain-sawed wood to recycled aluminum.
