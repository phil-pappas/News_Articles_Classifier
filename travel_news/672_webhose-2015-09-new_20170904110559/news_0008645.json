Kennedy International Airport in New York City last night. He called in to the air traffic control tower reporting a technical issue. \nHe knew it was going to be a “hot landing,” as the hydraulics system was leaking. This system failure caused the pilots to lose some of the control over the aircraft’s wing flaps and landing gear doors. The pilot reported that hydraulic fluid may be dumped on the runway as they land – a potential fire hazard. \nWhen the Boeing 757 touched down in a landing that had to take place faster than usual, the landing gear began to smoke and the starboard right main caught on fire. Fire trucks were standing at the ready and were able to immediately put out the flames. \nAll 115 passengers were disembarked safely. The FAA is investigating.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T21:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T00:35:48.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
