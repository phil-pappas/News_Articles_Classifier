The highlight was the Grand Hamburg Cruise Days Parade.\nAlong the event boulevard, which stretched for more than four kilometres between Cruise Center Altona and HafenCity, locals and visitors to Hamburg celebrated the first two days of the Hamburg Cruise Days with unparalleled enthusiasm. Under the blue skies and with pleasant, late-summer temperatures, the 15 Theme Islands invited visitors to browse, marvel and enjoy the wonderful world of cruises.\nOn Friday, the Costa neoRomantica and the Amadea – the new “dream ship” from the German television series – both visited the port of Hamburg; on Saturday, Mein Schiff 4, MS EUROPA and AIDAbella docked in the port.\nAt 21:20 on Saturday evening the great moment finally arrived: hundreds of thousands of cheering visitors gathered on the banks of the Elbe for a close-up view of the spectacular Hamburg Cruise Days Parade. Escorted by countless barges, sailing vessels and passenger ships, the cruise liners AIDAbella, Mein Schiff 4 and MS EUROPA made their way down the River Elbe – against the beautiful backdrop of the port, which was bathed in magical blue light as part of the BLUE PORT HAMBURG project. Each of the ships was welcomed with its own fireworks display and was waved off on its journey with a personalised laser message.\n“We are very satisfied with the first two days of the event,” say organisers Katja Derow and Uwe Bergmann. “The Hamburg Cruise Days Parade is the ultimate highlight of this event and once again showcased the most beautiful side of Hamburg.”\n“This evening once again showed why Hamburg sits at the very top of the shipping companies’ ranking of European destinations,” adds Thorsten Kausch, managing director of the Hamburg Convention Bureau, which issues the licence for the Hamburg Cruise Days. “The people of Hamburg have an unrivalled passion and enthusiasm for cruises, and the city will once again be broadcasting amazing images from the event all over the world.”\nOn Sunday, two iconic ships will be the stars in the port of Hamburg: Queen Mary 2 and MSC Splendida. Both liners will be leaving the port together in the evening, thus ending the event on a majestically high note.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T14:09:36.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
