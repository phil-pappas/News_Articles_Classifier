Those who suffer the most delays and cancellations get the biggest payouts.”\nSo will Delta consider a similar move for international flights?\n“Yes, that is something that’s resonating in the US” said Nathaniel Pieper, senior vice president, Europe Middle East, Africa and India for Delta Airlines.\n“It’s easy for us to make that commitment given what the operational gap is right now, domestically. Internationally it’s something we will keep looking at and see.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T16:47:05.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
