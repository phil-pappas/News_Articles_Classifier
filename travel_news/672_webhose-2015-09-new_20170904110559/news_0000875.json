Picture: REUTERS/DARREN ORNITZ NEW York City takes the top spot in the annual ranking of the world’s most expensive cities, according to an analysis by financial services firm UBS.\nThe cost of goods and services was higher in just two other cities — Zurich and Geneva — but they were less expensive than New York after including rent. The Swiss cities were markedly more expensive than in last year’s study because of the Swiss National Bank’s decision in January to discontinue its minimum exchange rate.\nPrices in Japanese and European cities, meanwhile, fell over the past year as the euro and yen weakened against the dollar.\nIncluding rent, other US cities among the most expensive included Chicago (7th), Miami (11th) and Los Angeles (13th).\nThe cheapest cities last year, among the 71 surveyed, were Kiev, Ukraine and the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. Prices were 2.5 times higher in the Swiss cities than in those Eastern European capitals.\nOf course, prices are only part of the equation: What about wages? The UBS analysis finds that residents of Zurich, Geneva and New York also earned the highest wages net of taxes, with pay that is nearly 19 times that of Nairobi, Jakarta and Kiev. Miami ranks fifth overall in pay, according to the bank’s analysis.\nSo how much are those wages worth, given prevailing prices? The UBS analysis looks at worldwide purchasing power and finds that, using net hourly pay, domestic purchasing power is highest in Luxembourg, Zurich and Geneva, followed by Miami and Los Angeles.\nThe domestic purchasing power analysis uses a basket of goods that represents the monthly consumption of a three-person family in Europe. Residents of the major cities in Switzerland can buy 20 such baskets a year, compared with 18 for the US, and 12 for European capitals such as London and Oslo. Residents of major cities in sub-Saharan Africa and India can buy just three every year.\nSuch a comparison is, of course, a bit hard to visualise, and UBS provides a different way to assess purchasing power — by looking at wage value: The time someone would need to work in order to afford, say, one McDonald’s Big Mac, or one iPhone 6.\nNew Yorkers, for example, need to work around 24 hours to make enough money to buy an iPhone 6. That is up from 20.6 hours for residents of Geneva, but much lower than 163.8 hours for residents of Shanghai or 334.2 hours for residents of Manila.\nWorking hours and time off from work represent another important contributor to purchasing power. Annual working hours exceed 2,000 in 19 major cities, mostly in Asia and the Middle East, while workers in Western Europe have the fewest hours and the most paid vacation days. For example, residents of Hong Kong clock in for 1,000 hours a year — or four hours per workday — more than workers in Paris.\nMore Africa news from The Wall Street Journal\nMore news from The Wall Street Journal\nPremium access to WSJ.com: $1 a week for 12 weeks", "external_links": ["http://online.wsj.com/public/page/news-africa.html?mod=TMGSAlink1", "https://join.wsjeuropesubs.com/tmg1", "http://online.wsj.com/europe?mod=TMGSAlink2", "https://www.wsjeuropesubs.com/wsj12offer/?tagsrc=/tmg1&rnd=54622c7ae7d81"], "published": "2015-09-23T20:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T18:28:10.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
