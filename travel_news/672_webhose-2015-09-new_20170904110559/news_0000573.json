Hiking into the Norwegian wilderness alone. \n2. Travelling with no money and sleeping outdoors. \n3. Tightrope walking across a cavern in the Blue Mountains. \n4. Paragliding topless in Fiji. \n5. Eating a bamboo rat. Bamboo rat on the menu. Picture: Scott Edmunds Source: \n6. Hiring a camel alone at the edge of the Sahara. \n7. Eating bulls testicles. \n8. Starting a karaoke party in a stranger’s flat with over 100 people inside. \n9. Making love in a canoe during a honeymoon. \n10. Taking part in a ‘Fear Factor Eating Comp’ in Tallinn, Estonia.
