According to Air Transport World and SITA, 97% of 2014 airline passengers traveled with a smartphone, laptop or tablet, and 18% carried all three.\nWithin a centrally controlled environment, CellPoint Mobile's Travel Bank mWallet™ supports Electronic Miscellaneous Documents (EMD), loyalty rewards, coupons and payment methods as tender, allows airlines to convert Denied Board Compensation (DBC) events and other types of compensation into revenue opportunities, and can integrate seamlessly with other electronic payment wallets, such as Apple Pay, Google Pay and MasterPass.\nThe ewallet also serves as a mobile repository of passenger travel documents, including boarding passes, tickets, loyalty program currencies and rewards status as well as notifications and other travel and payment data. Operating in online and offline mode, the Travel Bank mWallet™ ensures continuous access to passenger records.\nAirline-branded mobile solution\n\"Today's airlines recognize the importance of facilitating and aiding passenger's journeys in the mobile environment, but carriers are often challenged by costs, time and data integration hurdles of rolling out an airline-branded mobile wallet, as well as the added costs of attracting and acquiring customers into their online universe,\" said Kristian Gjerding , CEO of CellPoint Mobile.\n\"With this plug-and-play solution, airlines can deploy a fully branded digital universe across all channels in a matter of weeks, not months,\" he says. \"They can manage tender and non-tender records, enjoy higher conversion on both ticket sales and ancillary products/services, and boost revenues by leveraging additional cross-selling opportunities that emerge when passengers stay within an airline's branded universe for purchases and payments.\"\nGjerding and members of the CellPoint team will attend the IATA World Financial Symposium (WFS) Sept. 16-17 in Barcelona , where Gjerding will discuss \"Cyber Attack! Beyond Firewalls\" on Sept. 16 during a panel presentation on payments and loyalty program fraud. CellPoint Mobile is a 2015 WFS Silver Sponsor of the WFS. On Sept. 2 , CPM also announced a solution that enables airlines to roll out Apple Pay in a matter of hours or days, rather than weeks or months.\nAbout CellPoint Mobile: Making Travel Payments Easier\nCellPoint Mobile helps airlines around the world navigate and own the complex payments ecosystem from beginning to end, regardless of their passengers' preferred currency, payment method, device or channel.
