It said that largely normal services would be resumed on Thursday.\n\nPassengers queue in front of the counters in a terminal at the airport as Lufthansa pilots went on a strike in Frankfurt, Germany, Wednesday, Sept. 9, 2015.

The pilots want the airline to keep making transition payments for those seeking early retirement.\nJudges found that the union's aims went beyond the formal reason given for the strike to exerting more influence on Lufthansa's new low-cost operation, making the strike illegal, the court said in a statement.\nThe union has criticized CEO Carsten Spohr's drive to expand the company's low-cost operations under the Eurowings brand, with lower-paid staff.\nVereinigung Cockpit began its strike on long-haul flights Tuesday, forcing the cancellation of 90 flights, and extended the walk-out to medium-and short-haul flights Wednesday.\nUnion spokesman Markus Wahl told n-tv television after the ruling that it had told pilots to be available for work immediately. Wednesday's ruling overturned one by a lower court on Tuesday that went in the union's favour.\nLufthansa said about 500 of the airline's flights were still in operation Wednesday. Subsidiaries Germanwings, Swiss, Austrian Airlines or Brussels Airlines weren't involved.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T05:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:25:34.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
