The walks are available in Portland, Bar Harbor, Kennebunkport and Rockland; they are each between two and four hours long and include stops at locally owned restaurants, breweries and food producers. Pamela Laksey, the founder, and her staff lead the walks like the one through Portland’s Old Port to sample New England clam chowder, lobster mac and cheese, and potato doughnuts. A new addition this year is a culinary tour of Rockland, a city in the state’s northeast, where participants can try craft beers, Italian sausages from a local farmer and wines made from Maine-grown blueberries. Prices from $32. Portland tours are year-round, while the others run from June to Oct. 31. IN ROME, NEW ASSUNTA MADRE RESTAURANTS Assunta Madre , in Rome’s Campo dei Fiori neighborhood, is regarded as one of the best places in the city to enjoy fresh, simply prepared seafood. Now, the owner Gianni Micalusi is expanding his brand. A location in London’s Mayfair neighborhood opened last year, and two more are coming: one in Milan’s Piazza Repubblica, debuting Oct. 8, and another at the end of November in Barcelona on Passeig de Gracia, the city’s main thoroughfare. The menus at all four branches only serve fish found in the Mediterranean such as sea bream, octopus and perch, and while Mr. Micalusi says that he has always wanted to have restaurants in other cities, he likely won’t add more locations. “People eat at Assunta Madre because they know that the seafood is the highest quality and incredibly fresh, and I want to make sure to be able to maintain that standard, which is difficult to do with too many places,” he said. CELEBRATING HARVEST SEASON IN CALIFORNIA WINE COUNTRY Harvest season in California’s Napa Valley runs from mid-August to mid-October, and Cakebread Cellars in the town of Rutherford has a series of events planned during this festive time of year. The activities include a tour of the half-acre produce garden with the head gardener Anton Ginella, where guests are encouraged to sample fresh fruits and vegetables such as tomatoes and strawberries; culinary classes followed by a meal paired with wine, including one featuring comfort food; and several options for tastings like the one of five Cakebread reserve wines. Activities start at $15. Loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T12:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T13:18:14.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
