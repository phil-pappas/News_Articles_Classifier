If the destination is within 1km, walking is a good idea. However, if the distance is ranging from 2km to 50km, what transport can be chosen? After all, riding motorcycle is too cumbersome, while riding a bicycle takes too much physical strength. The advent of Fosjoas electric scooter has perfectly broken such a deadlock. It is like a bridge between driving a car and walking.Fosjoas electric scooters are small in size and light in weight, especially Fosjoas electric unicycle and twin-wheeled self-balancing scooter . They can smoothly weave in high streets and back lanes. Even the large-size U3 SUV electric scooter and K3 sitting-posture scooter are much smaller and lighter than motorcycle and bicycle. Meanwhile, riding Fosjoas electric scooter is energy-saving, because it adopts aerospace attitude control theory, fuzzy software algorithm and gyroscope system to realize self-balancing, which means all controls, like moving forward, speeding up, slowing down and braking by slightly leaning forward and backward. All of Fosjoas electric scooters are powered by emission-free electricity, which is helpful to improve the environmental quality. In addition, Fosjoas electric scooters are equipped with Japan-made lithium-ion batteries and the battery capacities are ranging from 88.8Wh to 680Wh. According to practical test, the maximum range of Fosjoas electric scooters is between 23km to 50km, which is able to cover all short-distance travels in daily life. People can ride them to work, to go to school, to go shopping, or to take a trip on weekends. Some large-scale work occasions, such as university campus, shopping mall, library and tourist attraction, also choose Fosjoas electric scooters as the alternatives for their staff. Overall, Fosjoas electric scooter not only facilitates daily life, but also improves work efficiency. # # #", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T06:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T02:25:44.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
