Secondary and primary research was conducted, including interviews with suppliers, regulation authorities, and distributors. The study provides key trends, opportunities, and a forecast of rolling stock deliveries for the rail industry. It also highlights the competitive factors and landscape in North America , the primary region for natural gas in rail locomotives. Key conclusions and a future outlook of the market have been provided. The base year is 2015; the forecast period is through to 2022.\nKey Findings\nGrowth in natural gas locomotives is expected to be concentrated in the North American market\n- US domestic production of natural gas is expected to exceed imports by 2017.\n- Tier-4 emission norms with 2015 deadlines require new technologies and strategies to participate in the market. 2 Dual Fuel Locomotives are likely to soon to become standard\n- GE, Cummins, and EMD engines are able to use natural gas through conversion kits from companies such as Westport and GFS Corp.\n- New entrants in the market such as Brookeville, MPI, and MP&ES are competing fiercely in the low-emission locomotives market. 3 Growth of natural gas locomotives heavily relies on fuel costs and availability\n- Investment in natural gas breaks even earlier only in scenarios where diesel prices are high; if fuel prices are low, it starts losing its advantage.\n- Other markets such as Russia and India are also experimenting with natural gas as a primary fuel in rail locomotives. However, growth in other regions is not expected to be comparable to that in North America .\nDownload the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3284131/\nAbout Reportbuyer\nReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers\nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com\nFor more information:\nSarah Smith\nResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.com\nEmail: query@reportbuyer.com\nTel: +44 208 816 85 48\nWebsite: www.reportbuyer.com\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/executive-analysis-of-implication-of-shale-gas-on-the-global-rail-industry-300148288.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=BR10112&Transmission_Id=201509231947PR_NEWS_USPR_____BR10112&DateId=20150923", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/executive-analysis-of-implication-of-shale-gas-on-the-global-rail-industry-300148288.html", "https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3284131/", "http://www.reportbuyer.com/"], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T07:09:56.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
