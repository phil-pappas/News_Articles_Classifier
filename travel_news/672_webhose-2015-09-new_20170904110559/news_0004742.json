In a challenging market such as India , these factors are key drivers that provide a competitive value proposition to customers.\nThis Frost & Sullivan market insight focuses on areas of prospective improvements, such as the active integration of safety technology in Indian vehicles and electrification of chassis systems.\nFurthermore, while the number of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in cars is reducing, the capability of each ECU is increasing.\nFor instance, in case of an accident, integrated features such as Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) and post-crash braking increase its life-saving abilities by %. All-Wheel Drives (AWDs) systems not only increase traction of the vehicle, but with the addition of the electronic factor, they can improve fuel efficiency by % compared to a mechanical AWD.\nThese features can potentially change the way the Indian automotive industry progresses in the future.\nDynamic Consumer Demand and Evolving Technology Trends\nConsumer demand in the global automotive market exhibits a pattern that is best summarized by the old adage: change is the only constant. Moreover, the dynamics of consumer demand for state-of-the-art technology follows the market lifecycle pattern, whereby premium vehicle manufacturers are usually the first to launch a product that later trickles down to the mass market in subsequent years. For instance, in the last two decades, most innovations have been in the areas of electrical assistance and electronic controls; the automotive industry is no exception to this trend.\nHowever, technologies such as Anti-lock Brake Systems (ABS), Electric Power Steering (EPS), and Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS) managed to penetrate the Indian market only after they had soared in developed markets, such as Europe , North America , and Japan . As most innovations rely heavily on the use of actuators, sensors, and controllers, the electronic content per vehicle is expected to increase phenomenally from nearly % (in existing vehicles) to % by 2030.\nDownload the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3095659/\nAbout Reportbuyer\nReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers\nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com\nFor more information:\nSarah Smith\nResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.com\nEmail: query@reportbuyer.com\nTel: +44 208 816 85 48\nWebsite: www.reportbuyer.com\n releases/chassis-system-electrification-and-active-safety-integration-300143744.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chassis-system-electrification-and-active-safety-integration-300143744.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=BR02500&Transmission_Id=201509152052PR_NEWS_USPR_____BR02500&DateId=20150915", "https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3095659/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.reportbuyer.com/"], "published": "2015-09-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T04:51:46.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
