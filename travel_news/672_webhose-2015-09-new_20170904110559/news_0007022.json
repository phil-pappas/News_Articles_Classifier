Share this article Share 97 shares The outcome of the ruling forced the government to spell out the reasons why the plaintiffs were barred and to provide an opportunity to challenge the government finding.\nDespite the cases, the government maintains that secrecy is key to the system so terrorists are not made aware they are being tracked.\nUnder legal pressure, however, the Obama administration will begin telling some suspected terrorists if and why they are on the list.\nHere are seven possible routes to being grounded.\nThe government maintain that secrecy is key to the system so terrorists are not made aware they are being tracked but many have fought the right to know if they are featured\n1. Being linked to terrorism activity\nThe Intercept leak not only listed the number on the list, but also explained the process behind names being added through terrorism activity.\nPeople included on the list included those convicted of or arrested for acts of terrorism, assassins, bombers, hostage takers, associates of terror groups amongst others.\nAccording to the document, issued by the National Counterterrorism Center, federal agencies can put someone forward for a government blacklist if 'an individual is known or suspected to be or has been knowingly engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.'\nEarlier this year it was discovered that the Charlie Hebdo murderers, Cherif and Said Kouachi, were on a British no-fly list after they were linked to Al Qaeda terrorists in 2008.\nThe brothers had been identified as a potential terror threat and placed on the list in case they tried to enter the UK or transit through a British airport.\nThe brothers were killed in a shoot-out after hiding in an industrial unit, two days after the attack on the offices of the satirical magazine, which killed 12 people.\n2. Drug use\nIn April last year, Nigella Lawson was banned from leaving Heathrow on a U.S-bound flight because she had admitted to taking drugs.\nThe 'Domestic Goddess' was forced to confess under oath during a trial that she had snorted cocaine seven times and smoked cannabis in front of her children.\nAlthough Scotland Yard did not act over her confession, the U.S. authorities took a tougher stance.\nMiss Lawson is thought to have tried to enter the U.S. by registering online for permission to travel and confirming she had not been arrested or convicted of offences including taking illegal drugs.\nBut the US can also decide to bar foreigners who have committed drugs offences without ever being charged. Would-be travellers can apply to have the ban lifted, but this can take months.\n3. Travelling frequently to the wrong country\nCertain trouble areas can cause questions to be asked, and frequent travel to these areas can be a reason for concern.\nAirline industry analyst Robert Mann said to Yahoo Travel : 'If you travel frequently to countries that are known to be involved in terrorism or financial crimes, you do run the risk of having your travels alerted more carefully.'\n4. Error on the form\nSometimes errors can occur - like the FBI ticking the wrong box on a form.\nA former Stanford University student was mistakenly suspected as a terrorist and placed on the government's 'no-fly' list for nine years because an FBI agent checked the wrong box on her form.\nRahinah Ibrahim, 48, an architect and scholar, was finally allowed to return to the United States in 2014 after fighting to clear her name since 2005.\nIn January of that year, Ibrahim was arrested and detained for two hours at San Francisco Airport as she boarded a flight to her native Malaysia with her 14-year-old daughter.\nAlsup said the reason for the initial mistake was that FBI special agent Kevin Kelly, who was investigating Ibrahim for reasons the government won't disclose, had 'misunderstood the directions' on a government form and 'checked the wrong boxes' â€” ignoring written instructions that she should not be placed on the no-fly list, according to The Chronicle.\nSometimes errors can occur, and this has been the case for a number of cases where the FBI have ticked the wrong box on a form\n5. Having a similar name as someone on the list\nIn 2007, TV programme 60 Minutes researched and interviewed 12 individuals who shared names of people on the list.\nThese included people who shared the name Robert Johnson, who had previously been convicted of plotting a bombing of a Hindu temple. All Robert Johnsons said they have had trouble getting on airplanes.\n6. As a crime\nIn 2011 it emerged that an immigration officer had tried to rid himself of his wife by adding her name to a list of terrorist suspects.\nHe used his access to security databases to include his wife on a watch list of people banned from boarding flights into Britain because their presence in the country is 'not conducive to the public good'.\nAs a result the woman was unable for three years to return from Pakistan after travelling to the county to visit family.\nThe tampering went undetected until the immigration officer was selected for promotion and his wife's name was found on the suspects' list during a vetting inquiry.\nThe Home Office confirmed that the officer was sacked for gross misconduct.\nWhile most of us have nothing to worry about, social media posts are not automatically discounted when forming a case for someone being added to the list\n7. Controversial tweeting\nAccording to the Intercept leak, the guidelines stated that social media posts 'should not be automatically discounted' when forming a case for someone being added to the list.\nAgents are required to 'evaluate the credibility of the source, as well as the nature and specificity of the information, and nominate even if that source is uncorroborated', it said.\nIn addition to this, last month the Huffington Post reported that according to FBI Director James Comey, Twitter has been 'very cooperative' with FBI agents looking into individuals affiliated with the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations that use the social network to organize and inspire people within the U.S. to commit terrorist acts.\nThe director stated that a lot of terrorist recruits first interact with overseas terrorists on Twitter.\nRead more: She got on the no-fly list because the FBI checked the wrong box - SFGate Blog Unlikely Terrorists On No Fly List - Page 2 - CBS News The Secret Government Rulebook For Labeling You a Terrorist 8 Ways You Can End Up On the No-Fly List If You're Trying To Join ISIS Through Twitter, The FBI Probably Knows About It", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=", "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/unlikely-terrorists-on-no-fly-list/2/", "http://blog.sfgate.com/stew/2014/02/07/she-got-on-the-no-fly-list-because-the-fbi-checked-the-wrong-box/", "http://dailym.ai/1Uq0o49", "https://www.yahoo.com/travel/8-ways-you-can-end-up-on-the-no-fly-list-128069176492.html", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/09/isis-twitter-fbi-islamic-state_n_7763992.html", "https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/07/23/blacklisted/"], "published": "2015-09-02T03:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:13:59.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
