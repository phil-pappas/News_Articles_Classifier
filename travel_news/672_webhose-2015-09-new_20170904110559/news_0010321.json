Thankfully, as time goes by those stories fade from humiliating failures to funny anecdotes. I took my first test nearly 30 years ago. It was in Wilmslow, a wealthy Cheshire town with streets not so much paved with gold but with top-of-the-range Mercedes. So it was not that surprising that I reversed straight into one of the many parked on the side road where I performed my three-point turn; or that I failed my test. It took me two more tests before I finally passed, but all that really matters is I got there in the end. Here are some more L-plate driving fails. You know how you're supposed to hold your hands at ten to two on either side of the wheel? Well, on my second lesson I kept holding them at the bottom and so my instructor told me to put my hands up. So, I did. In the air. While driving down a dual carriageway!” Claire Gibbons, 34, mother of three, Cheshire Driving to my first test with the instructor for some last-minute tips, I managed to take his car's wing mirror off on another vehicle. I was so shaken up that I made one mistake after another on the test itself and, unsurprisingly, failed. On my second I didn’t stop at a zebra crossing as a mother crossed with her buggy.

He’s had to grab the wheel three times so far. Now I’m just waiting for him to hand me the number of another instructor.” Merrily Johnston, 17, student, Cheshire I failed to get the car into third gear at any point on my driving test. I failed. When I did pass on my second attempt I was so surprised I asked the examiner if he was absolutely sure, which I immediately regretted when I saw the doubt suddenly pass over his face.” Emma Lander, 35, blogger, Lancashire I failed my third test by driving into a yellow box at a busy junction, and waiting for the seasons to roll around, until the examiner finally shouted, 'Go now!' At which point I realised I hadn’t passed.” Michael Evers, 27, solicitor, Sheffield The first time I took my test I was ill-advised by my mother to take a couple of caffeine tablets to help my nerves. As the examiner failed me, he said, ‘If I'd said boo to you, I think you would have leapt out of the window.’ \" Julie Simmons, 47, chef, Dorset Sometimes things go wrong, no matter how skilled you are behind the wheel. With the AA on your side, you're covered when the unpredictable happens.
