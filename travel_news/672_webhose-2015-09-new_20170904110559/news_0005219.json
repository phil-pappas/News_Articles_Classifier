Myanmar's Unprotected Beauty Only 5% of the natural habitat of Indo-Burma remains, making it one of the most at-risk biodiversity hotspots in the world, with deforestation at critical levels.Only 5% of the natural habitat of Indo-Burma remains, making it one of the most at-risk biodiversity hotspots in the world, with deforestation at critical levels. However, Myanmar, previously protected from the fast pace of development, still has forest covering some 47% of its land. Add in the rich marine habitat and diverse coastal regions, and this relatively undeveloped country shines in Asia for its unspoiled beauty.Support from pressure groups and organizations working within Myanmar provide a vital level of protection, flagging issues and attempting to steer the course of development in a positive direction. Steve Pearmain, MD of ASEAN environmental consultancy SLP Environmental, says that regulations are being implemented.However, for a country with such prized assets, are environmental protections going to come too late, leaving Myanmar dangerously unprotected in the meantime?With poor resource governance, a lack of responsible tourism policies, and a need for greater strategic impact assessments, the influx of tourists could trip Myanmar up on the road to sustainability if policymakers and the community try and run before they can walk. The Myanmar Tourism Sector-Wide Impact Assessment, released earlier this year by the Myanmar Center for Responsible Business, warns of dangers on the road ahead if the pace is too fast.\"There is still scope to develop Myanmar as a destination for smaller numbers of high-spending tourists looking for an experience that makes the country special. A mass market strategy that generates negative impacts on Myanmar's environment and culture could kill the goose that lays the golden egg soon after the journey begins.\" Said Steve Pearmain, MD of ASEAN environmental consultancy SLP EnvironmentalMyanmar Investment Commission(MIC)is stipulating that new project developers either prepare an Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) or a full Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) as part of their application process for investor privileges.\"Read the full story HERE Valere TjolleSpecial pre-release offer at www.SustainableTourism2015.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T01:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T02:09:59.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
