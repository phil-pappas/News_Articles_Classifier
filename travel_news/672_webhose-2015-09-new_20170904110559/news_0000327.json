After a lengthy standoff, police say Hemingway drove a car toward officers, stopped and got out of the car with a gun. That's when two Burlington police officers say they fired at him.\nHemingway was wounded in the abdomen and the foot.\nHemingway's arraignment on disorderly conduct and simple assault charges will likely be delayed for days while the state's attorney's office continues to review the case.\nRelated Stories:\nPolice ID cops who shot at Colchester man\nBPD officers involved in Colchester shooting", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T13:55:59.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
