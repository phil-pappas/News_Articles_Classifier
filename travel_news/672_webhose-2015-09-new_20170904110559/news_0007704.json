After its September launch, the program will dedicate one week every month to sharing curated neighbor spotlights across select regions for “Meet the Neighbors.” All contributors will live or work within walking distance to a Canopy by Hilton hotel, ranging from shops and restaurant owners to students and fitness instructors. “Meet the Neighbors” for Canopy Reykjavik will showcase three distinct features – Into The Glacier, Laurgardalur, and Slippbarinn, all of which will include with tips and advice from locals. \n“Reykjavik is a thriving city with a robust creative community and a unique energy,” said Gary Steffen, global head, Canopy by Hilton. “We are excited to discover more of Reykjavik and Canopy’s other destinations with our #MeetTheNeighbors campaign through the tips and advice of our new neighbors.” \nInto the Glacier takes followers to Iceland’s most significant new attraction, the man made ice cave tunnel, located high on Europe’s second largest glacier; Langjokull glacier. Followers will see the glacier from the inside and gaze upon the beautiful blue ice, truly a unique experience. \nLaurgardalur, a popular recreational, fitness, and green area in Reykjavik, will be the second feature. It includes Laugardalslaug center, a superb set of well-heated swimming-pools, hot tubs and saunas. This is the place were locals come together to have a chat about everything and nothing – a true local experience. \nSlippbarinn the last feature, is Reykjavik’s hottest cocktail bar, extremely popular with locals and travelers alike. \nCanopy Reykjavik | City Centre is now under construction on Hverfisgata St, a thriving neighborhood in the center of the city. The hotel is slated to open in early 2016 with the brand’s thoughtfully local aesthetic, which includes an open, light lobby and relaxing public spaces. A rooftop bar and restaurant will serve drinks and food throughout the day, while guests can also visit a bistro, sampling fresh, local produce while taking in the city sights. \nTravel enthusiasts and locals can join the conversations by following Canopy by Hilton on Twitter and Facebook by following @canopybyhilton or using the hashtag #CanopybyYou.
