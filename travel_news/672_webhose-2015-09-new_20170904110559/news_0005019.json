Now is the time for businesses, and service providers to commit to a level of 'best practices' for the benefit of consumers. Surveys show that mobile adoption is being stifled because of consumer concerns over security and the misuse of their personal data. The first step toward overcoming those hurdles is to provide written expectations of what payment perfection needs to be,\" said Love. \n\"This Mobile Payments Bill of Rights i s not meant as a directive from one company,\" Love continued. \"Rather, it is intended as a super-simple, flexible, living document owned by all that encourages transparency, multi-layers of security, satisfaction, and accountability. We are hopeful that companies worldwide will add to and adopt the Bill of Rights and that the articles within will evolve, as consumer preferences mandate.\" \nReferences to the Mobile Payments Bill of Rights first emerged at the conference as Love joined fellow mobile payments experts onstage for a retail-focused panel discussion titled: \"Mobile Payments: A Retail Fairy Tale in the Making.\" The panel, moderated by Greg Wilfahrt , AP Technology's Chief Mobility and Marketing Officer, also featured global mobile expert, Nick Holland (Javelin Strategy and Research), Mario Di Prizio (former head of mobile commerce and retail for Sears, Kmart), and Country Music star, Rick Monroe . \n\"The Mobile Payments Bill of Rights is a great step forward, pointing everyone toward a friction-less and safe buying experience,\" Monroe told conference attendees. \"Many musicians such as myself recognize that the purchase of music and merchandise are impulse buys. When a moment is lost, so is a purchase. And that makes the villain in the mobile payments fairy tale, without a doubt, the 'Wicked Witch of the Wait.' So, with any buying experience, it's important that my connection with fans at the mobile register (smartphones) be as immediate and positive as my emotional connection with them onstage.\" In addition to his current hit, \" Great Minds Drink Alike ,\" Monroe is a frequent resident on Billboard's Country Music Chart for singles that include \" Midnight Rider ,\" and \" Fires Out .\" \nAP Technology's Greg Wilfahrt echoed Monroe's sentiments on the need for speed in attaining transaction satisfaction, adding that mobile payment adoption and growth is contingent not only upon quick turnaround, but on security, ease-of-use, and ubiquity. \"Consumer confidence and consistent, positive user experiences are what will fast-track mobile payment adoption and revenue growth,\" said Wilfahrt. \"The Mobile Payments Bill of Rights is a good way to establish an initial level of accountability and expectations for all.\" \nWhen asked by someone in the crowd how important it was for retailers to incorporate a mobile strategy into their businesses, former Sears and Motorola executive Mario Di Prizio stated, \"If you don't already have a mobile initiative, drop what you are doing, and get one -- now.\" \nDi Prizio then polled the conference audience to discover how many of them owned a smartphone. Seeing that 100 percent of attendees at the session owned smartphones, Di Prizio stated, \"You are all consumers, as well as businesspeople. Don't miss this amazing opportunity to monetize your fellow customers -- 24/7. The Mobile Payments Bill of Rights or something like it should be part of everyone's strategy to provide exceptional buying experiences. Mobile payments enable businesses to engage customers and retain them for repeat business in ways that were never before possible.\" \nThe number of mobile phones, tablets and pads now exceeds the planet's population, yet mobile payments is still considered a nascent industry. Love, Di Prizio, Holland, Monroe, and Wilfahrt all agreed that it is critical for a code of best practices to make its appearance during this early stage. \"Consumers need to wield more power at time of purchase, they need the final say on how their individual information is collected and later utilized,\" commented Love. \"Transparency is key. Consumers deserve the right to dictate how their data is gathered and used for marketing purposes. They deserve to see that intent clearly represented, and to receive only marketing messages for which they have freely opted-in.\" \nPanel moderator Greg Wilfahrt ended the session with a final thought: \"Mobile payments remains a story that is still being written. And although evils such as fraud, theft, spam, and poor user experiences remain reasons for concern, it is clear that the prevailing sentiment amongst consumers and retailers alike is that there will be a happy ending to this retail fairy tale.\" \nThe AP Technology-authored Mobile Payments Bill of Rights is as follows: \nMobile Payments Bill of Rights \nPREAMBLE \nIn order to create and maintain a safe, secure, and progressive environment for transactions occurring on mobile devices and to instill business and consumer confidence in payment processes that promote the anywhere-anytime growth and global exchange of goods and services, this Mobile Payments Bill of Rights was created. \nThe intent of this document is to protect and to serve the interests of mobile consumers, while providing enterprises and mobile payment providers with \"best practices\" guidelines.
