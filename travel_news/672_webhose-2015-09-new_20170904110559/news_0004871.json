Joining him are key members of the local creative, trade and media communities.\n \n“Singapore and the United States share a close relationship across a range of strategic and long-standing initiatives, including our cultural links. In celebrating 50 years of this relationship since Singapore’s independence in 1965, we are pleased to highlight this cultural showcase in New York City, the global creative capital. Through Singapore: Inside Out, we hope to share a perspective of Singapore’s vibrant and contemporary arts scene, and look forward to spark new opportunities for creative exchanges. Singapore: Inside Out had considerable success in Beijing and London earlier this year, and I expect that it will receive a warm reception in New York City as well,” said Ambassador Mirpuri.\n \nIn addition to the works featured in the Singapore: Inside Out showcase, collaborations between American and Singaporean artists added local flavor to the five-day festival’s exciting line-up.
