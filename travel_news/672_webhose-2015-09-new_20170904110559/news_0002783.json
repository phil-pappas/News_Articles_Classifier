Comment Posted Sep. 21, 2015 at 9:28 AM By John Hacker Posted Sep. 21, 2015 at 9:28 AM Carthage sees its fair share of people walking, bicycling, motorcycling and using other means of transportation on the Mother Road, and each person has a story. Meet Harvey Cain, he's 85 years old, a retired doctor and long-time endurance bike rider and he's bicycling on Route 66 to a big homecoming at his alma mater. Cain and his support driver, Ken Stinson, are headed to Lake Forest, Illinois, north of Chicago, and they plan to be there for the Lake Forest College homecoming football game on Oct. 10. In fact, Lake Forest College officials said in the college's magazine that if all goes as planned, Cain will ride his bike at the head of the Homecoming parade. Cain passed through Carthage on Sept. 11 and spent time exploring Carthage's Civil War history. Cain and Stinson stayed in their motor home at the Battle of Carthage State Historic Site and toured the Civil War Museum before getting lunch at the Pancake Hut where The Carthage Press caught up with them. Heading home Not only is Cain an alumni of Lake Forest College from the class of 1952, he was born at the hospital on the campus to parents who were Lake Forest alumni and served in leadership on the campus. Cain said his ride is not only a personal dream, its a fundraiser. “He referred to this as a charity ride,” Stinson said. “What he has done is he has challenged the alumni of the college that are going to be attending the homecoming, and those that are not. The homecoming is Oct. 10, so we have to be in Lake Forest on Oct. 10.” In a video Cain put on YouTube in July before leaving Sacramento, he challenged alumni to donate a penny per mile for each of the 3,000 miles he will ride by the end of the trip, or $30, to the college's scholarship fund. Cain is a retired doctor and worked for the Kaiser Permanente group in California. That's where Stinson and Cain met. Stinson was a chief respiratory therapist for Kaiser and he's been keeping a log of the trip, including Cain's medical statistics and information. Cain said he's promoted the trip on youTube and through Lake Forest College's own publications and he's hoping for a good response from the alumni. Recovery Cain is an experienced endurance rider on bicycles and horses. He's ridden across the U.S. twice, and he's participated with Stinson in what Stinson called ride and tie endurance horseback riding events, where a team of two riders and one horse complete a course by leapfrogging. “Out in the Old West, when two cowboys would be out and one horse would have to be put down and they would end up with one horse and two riders, they found out that these two riders and one horse could cover distance most expeditiously by leapfrogging,” Stinson said. “The rider and the horse go much faster than the walker and when one rider would get up on ahead, he'd tie the horse up and take off walking. This guy would catch up and the horse is now rested, so the second rider would gallup on past this guy and again, get off and tie the horse and go forward. This guy would catch up to the rested horse, leapfrogging all the way on the trip.” Page 2 of 2 - Stinson said he and Cain have teamed up in several races like that. Cain is an avid cyclist as well and in fact is still recovering from a major cycling accident that happened only two years ago. Cain said he was hit by a woman who was crossing five lanes of traffic in a California rush hour and thrown over the hood of the woman's car. He spent five days in the hospital recovering and he still hasn't started approaching the distances he was riding before the crash. But that wasn't going to hold him back from completing this ride. No plan Cain and Stinson have been pushing hard on the first two-thirds of the trip, but they've also been stopping to take in some of the sights. Cain is a Civil War enthusiast who serves on a Civil War Round Table in Sacramento, so he had to see Carthage's Civil War Museum. “We've had a very interesting trip because I knew I wasn't good for the kind of mileage per day that I used to be,” Cain said. “And also, I thought I'm not going to be coming this way very often, so we've kind of been trying to take it all in, which is of course, impossible. We've stopped on the way, like your great Civil War Museum here, we spent several hours with a volunteer there. We know about the Battle of Carthage being the first pitched battle of the Civil War. I'm going to be passing the word.” He's been riding a bicycle since he was nine years old and earned the money to buy his first bike with help from his grandmother. Cain learned to ride on Route 66 where it intersected the old Lincoln Highway in Plainview Illinois. “I can remember sitting on my front lawn wondering if I'd ever see the westward end of either one of those highways,” Cain said. Stinson added: “It's quite fitting he learned to ride his bicycle on Route 66 and here he is riding Route 66.” By John Hacker", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T08:43:51.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
