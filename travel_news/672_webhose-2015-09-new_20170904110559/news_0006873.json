This is a real possibility if the rate of poaching in South Africa remains at its current horrific levels,\" andBeyond CEO Joss Kent said in a statement. \n\"We view translocations as critical to the survival of the species and are proud to have been part of the team responsible for bringing this new life into a world where it can grow and thrive without fear of losing its life to poacher.\" \nThis particular female rhino was moved earlier this year with a calf. However, blood tests found that she was also pregnant. \nSince being relocated to her new home in Botswana, she gave birth to the adorable calf. \nGreat Plains Conservation CEO Dereck Joubert has welcomed the birth of the baby rhino. \n\"One more rhino can be added to the roster and now runs free in the wild as a symbol of hope. With global support there is hope for the future of rhinos. This little one is a real rhino ambassador,\" he said. \nHave a look at the beautiful calf below: Credit: Karin Verdirame", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T23:28:35.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
