From backpacks to school supplies, sports equipment to uniforms, medical care and more, growing kids' needs can easily outlast their parents' pocketbooks. Fortunately, community service organizations in 18 states across the nation have a willing partner in Mister Car Wash , a company that prides itself on giving back to the communities it serves.\n\"We are honored to partner with organizations that share our passion for being good community partners and inspiring people to shine,\" said Mister Car Wash Fundraising Specialist Lauren Hobbs . According to Hobbs, more than 350 non-profits have partnered with Mister Car Wash so far in 2015 alone.\nLions Club Helps Kids See\nIn Iowa , Clive Lions International recently augmented its traditional pancake breakfasts, popcorn and cookbook sales with Mister Car Wash fundraisers in the Des Moines area. Funds raised have helped Lions provide eye exams and glasses for children whose families cannot afford this expense, among a multitude of other service projects.\n\"We should all be good parents but sometimes parents need help helping their kids. The Lions can do that,\" said Brad Brown , President of Clive Lions . \"We just try and do what is right to help others. Service to others is a way to pay it forward,\" Brown said.\nKiwanis Helps Kids in Need\nSpokane Valley Kiwanis Club has been partnering with Mister Car Wash for 15 years. According to club spokesperson Joseph Rudmann , a Kiwanis member for 24 years, early on the club's fundraising efforts were focused on international efforts. Today, the club's volunteer hours and funds are used directly for helping kids in need in the local Spokane community.\n\"About 60% of our donations go to children,\" Rudmann said.\nRecently they have helped kids through organizations like Baskets for Babies, which provides a bassinette to needy mothers-to-be, and Cribs for Kids and Fantasy Flights.\n\"One service project I'm very proud of supporting,\" Rudmann said, \"is Fantasy Flights, which takes needy kids to the Spokane airport where they are put on the plane and zoom around the airport to then land right next to a hangar that has the North Pole set up so kids can go in and get to see Santa. About 100 volunteers dress up like elves. They play games, offer gifts, candy, lunch and everything. It's absolutely amazing. Every one of them is a needy kid, five to 10 years old.\"\nSchools Need Help for Arts and Sports Programs\nSchool booster clubs routinely partner with Mister Car Wash to support sports and arts programs. In Boise, Idaho , for example, Charger Arts recently raised several thousand dollars in just two months for the arts at Cole Valley Christian School.\n\"I believe that a good school has a strong arts program, and that's why I became involved in Charger Arts,\" said Clayton Trehal , father of three. \"I want my children and other children attending the school to have opportunities to learn about and practice the arts. \"\nTrehal's grandfather was an artist and he's always been inclined to the arts himself. Of his three children, one student is in band, one is in drama, and another participates in the arts programs in elementary school.\n\"I just want them to have those opportunities so they will give the arts a chance, and if they are naturally talented in the arts, I want them to have the opportunity to develop that talent,\" Trehal said.\nGiving Back: A Shared Calling\nGiving back is a calling for service-minded people like Brown, Rudmann and Trehal.\n\"I believe giving and service are rewarding to oneself and very helpful to others,\" said Brown. \"By giving of one's time or expertise we can be of service to humanity and impact people's lives. What a great way to stretch our own self being and show our own kids and friends the importance of giving back.\"\nGiving back can be a calling for conscientious companies, too. \"With Mister Car Wash's streamlined fundraising approach, non-profit organizations can spend less time fundraising and more time giving back,\" Hobbs said.\nTo learn more, email fundraising@mistercarwash.com , stop by any Mister Car Wash location, or call Lauren Hobbs , Fundraising Specialist, at 855-748-3007.\nAbout Mister Car Wash\nMister Car Wash operates 157 car washes and 32 express lubes in 18 states.
