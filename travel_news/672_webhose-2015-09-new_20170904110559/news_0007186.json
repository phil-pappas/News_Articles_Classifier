Participants in the aptly named \"Panic Mountain\" will spend the night in frightening isolation in the middle of a mountain forest. While other scare-themed events tend to put individuals through one-sided experiences without any objective, Panic Mountain is team-based, fully interactive and progressive. Groups of 12-15 people will approach a series of team-based challenges unified by one storyline and work together to overcome each one. Tickets can be purchased online at www.panicmountain.com .\nThe challenges (known by the creators as \"mods\") are mental and physical in nature, such as panic/escape rooms, obstacle courses, and mazes. One mod will feature a high-tech system where participants will need to guide each other through a dark room crawling with zombies. Through an earpiece, the person in the room will receive directions for their every step. This guidance will come from a teammate outside of the room watching via an infrared camera feed. Another mod will include escaping from zombies by way of a flight through darkness on a 700 foot zip line.\nZombie survival training will also be an integral part of the experience, and teams will learn key tactics and skills during their preparation. Zombies will be roaming the surrounding woods and participants will be taught how to respond to zombie encounters in order to complete the challenges successfully. After the challenges, participants will remain on site to attend an after party and spend the night in cabin accommodations.\nPanic Mountain will take place every Friday, Saturday and Sunday from October 2nd through November 1st . Each overnight ticket purchase includes dinner, event challenges, the after party and one night of cabin accommodations.
