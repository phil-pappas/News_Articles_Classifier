On Aug 22, over 40,000 dancers gathered to celebrate the founding 150 years ago of Maha Sarakham, a part of Isan distinguished not by its natural scenery but by its unique cultural heritage 3 Sep 2015 at 06:47 549 viewed 0 comments NEWSPAPER SECTION: LIFE | WRITER: KARNJANA KARNJANATAWE \nWomen from 13 districts of Maha Sarakham wear traditional costumes of yellow and brown tones, representing the colours of their province. Their hair buns are decorated with white frangipani, the designated flower of the province. - + There was a reason why more than 40,000 people, mostly women, were standing in long rows on the main streets in the heart of Maha Sarakham. On Aug 22, they dressed up in yellow blouses and performed a traditional dance in the afternoon heat to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the province. Although the show was perhaps less than five minutes, each of them had been practising for that moment for over two months. \n\"It is a big event that we all look forward to,\" said Phannee Chuchuen, a villager of Ban Kut Rang, a silk weaving community. \nMaha Sarakham was founded on Aug 22 in 1865, during the reign of King Rama IV. It is a small province in the Northeast and is known as one of the education centres of the region. \nThe original name of the province, according to historical records, was Ban Lat Kut Yang Yai, meaning an area where a big tree (from the family of Dipterocarpaceae ) was found. The name was changed to Maha Salakham. The official name was a direct translation of Kut Yang Yai into the Pali language. Later the spelling was somehow changed to Maha Sarakham and has been used until today. \nAccording to governor Chayawut Chanthon, the land in the province is flat and suitable for farming. About 90% of the population are farmers. There are no mountain ranges, waterfalls or valleys. The main tourist attractions, thus, are not found in its natural scenery but more so in its cultural heritage. \n\"Maha Sarakham has one of sacred sites in Isan,\" he said. It is Phra That Na Dun which is located in the Phra That Na Dun Temple. \nPhra That Na Dun is one of the sacred sites in the Northeast, a stupa that houses Buddha's relics. The stupa is 50.5m high and located in the Phra That Na Dun Temple in Na Dun district, about 70km south of the city. \nThe pagoda of Phra That Na Dun was built about 30 years ago to house Lord Buddha's relics that were found in 1979 in an old ruin located in an area believed to be part of Nakhon Champasi, the ancient city of the Dvaravati period between the 8th-10th centuries. Also found in the same area were numerous Buddha amulets, with some now displayed at Khum Bun Tam Than, a private museum in the city. \nThere are also weaving villages in Maha Sarakham. A place worth visiting is Ban Kut Rang village, where visitors can observe how locals create small woven patterns called Soi Dok Mak on silk cloth. The fine and small geometric patterns have been selected as the icon of the silk woven cloth of the province. \nAnother weaving village, which is a little low profile, is located in Ban Tha Khon Yang. There is a group of housewives who have for preserved a 150-year-old traditional weaving technique to produce their cotton cloth. They are descendants of the Yo ethnic group from a central part of Laos. They use sticks to create patterns and their traditional design is called wong duean . The patterns come with two choices of rectangles with small square shapes and circular shapes with square designs. \nIn addition, there are old temples with remarkable mural paintings created by local artists at Wat Photharam and Wat Pa La Lei in the Na Dun district as well as old standing Buddha sculptures that were found during the Dvaravati period at Wat Buddha Mongkol and Wat Suwannawat, in Kantharawichai district. \n\"Fortunately, Thainess is the focus of the Tourism and Sports Ministry this year. As Maha Sarakham has various cultural attractions, we believe we will have a chance to welcome more visitors this year and for other years to come,\" said the governor. \nWirach Thagrinate, 51, stands in front of his artwork. He created a new technique for his painting in 1999 when he changed from painting oil on canvas to drawing and colouring on tiles. The concept of his work relates to Buddha images and traditional Thai culture. Thanks to his creativity and a background of many years in hand-painted Benjarong porcelain, overglazed enamel with strong colours like red, yellow, green and gold, his art was certified as five-star Otop (One Tambon One Product) of Maha Sarakham. Wirach received the title of Artist of Isan 10 years ago. His house in Kantharawichai district is open as a showroom called Ban Benjarong Gallery. The gallery is open daily from 9am to 5pm. \nThis small ordination hall is called sim in the local Isan dialect. It has only one entrance with two windows at each side of the door. This sim was built in 1908. Its is 17m wide by 22m in length. The murals outside and inside the hall make the place unique. The murals depict stories about Lord Buddha. There are also words written in the old Thai Noi language. Locals still use the ordination hall for some ceremonies, including monk ordination ceremonies. The hall is located in Wat Photharam in Ban Dong Bang, Na Dun district. Another well maintained sim is located in Wat Pa Le Lai. The hall is smaller than the first one. It is 10m wide and 15m long. The murals tell the story of the Buddha and also the local way of life, including a group of men with tattoos on their legs. Women are not allowed to go inside either of the ordination halls. \nBan Kut Rang in Kut Rang district is famous for pha mai mat mee, tie-dye silk woven cloth. The well-known pattern called soi dok mak showcases small flowers of betel nut trees. Like the other old villages in Isan, locals have woven their own clothes for a long time. About 18 years ago, 40 housewives joined forces to establish the Ban Kut Rang Silk Woven Cloth Group. The small soi dok mak pattern, alongside over 300 other designs of silk woven clothes, won a provincial competition in 2001. Since then soi dok mak has been known as the woven pattern of Maha Sarakham. The group has a small factory in their village. It is open daily from 9am to 5pm. \nLocated in Kantharawichai district, Ban Tha Khon Yang is an old community of Yo, an ethnic group who emigrated from the Khammouan province of Laos during the period of King Rama III. The community has been famous for weaving in khit style hand-woven cloth which has geometric patterns. The original pattern of Yo is called wong duean. It is used by both men and women. The size of the male cloth is larger and looks like pha khao ma loincloth which men fasten around their waist. For women, pha khit is used as a shawl which is called pha biang. Ban Tha Khon Yang also provides a homestay service. \nA 1km-long wooden bridge has recently been fixed by locals and soldiers. Governor Chayawut Chanthon wants to promote the bridge as another attraction in the province. The bridge was built 50 years ago for villagers to cross over the Kae Dam swamp located in Kae Dam district, 28km south of the city. Locals thus call the bridge Saphan Mai Kae Dam, meaning Kae Dam wooden bridge. \nRujiporn Robwongchan is holding a tray full of khanom thian kaeo, bite-sized snacks wrapped in banana leaves. The dessert is made of sugared tapioca flour and is stuffed with little salty ground mungbeans mixed with pepper and onions. It is one of famous souvenirs from Maha Sarakham and available only at the house of Mae Phunsri which has operated as a small factory for making khanom thian kaeo for 13 years. To taste the snack, visit Khanom Thian Kaeo Mae Phunsri in Muang district.
