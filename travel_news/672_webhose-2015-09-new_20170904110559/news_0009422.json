There are 5 pairs per day and tickets include a limited edition Tim Layzell poster, VIP tour of the show and a glass of bubbly. In addition to this, we are offering 50 runners up a pair of General Admission tickets to attend on Sunday, November 1, 2015. If you’re lover of classic Aston Martins, Ferraris and even Minis, make a beeline for Alexandra Palace this autumn. Classic & Sports Car, the world’s best-selling classic car magazine, is holding its first-ever London show on Friday, October 30 to Sunday, November 1 – and the organisers are promising a display of 300 of the world’s most prestigious historic automobiles. Set within one of London’s most majestic venues, which also offers a fantastic view of the capital, visitors will be treated to stands filled with tempting stock from the world’s greatest classic car dealers, accessories stalls and even a champagne bar. Plus there’ll be three eye-catching feature displays. Most newsworthy is the magazine’s Best British Car Ever centerpiece – a display of ten classics, handpicked by experts on the classic car scene, including Gordon Murray, designer of the McLaren F1, Dire Straits front man and classic car collector, Mark Knopler, and Lotus designer Russell Carr. The top ten shortlist features machinery such as the glamorous Jaguar E-type, loveable Mini Cooper S, revolutionary original Range Rover and the brutish Bentley Speed Six among others. You can feast your eyes on the full top ten at the show – and you’ll also learn which will be crowned ‘Best British Car Ever’, as the shortlist has already been put to the public vote with the winner set to be revealed at Alexandra Palace. Other standout features include a celebration of James Bond’s favourite car maker, Aston Martin, with a selection of the brand’s oldest, newest and most famous cars. If that wasn’t enough, the show will also pay tribute to that legend of the motorsport world, Sir Stirling Moss, with a stand dedicated to his British single seater racers.
