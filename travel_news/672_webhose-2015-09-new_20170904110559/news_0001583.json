(AP) — Jurors are now deliberating the fate of a suspended Roman Catholic priest from western Pennsylvania accused of traveling to Honduras to molest poor street children during missionary trips.\nDefense attorneys rested their case in Cambria County Court on Friday afternoon without calling the Rev. Joseph Maurizio Jr. to the stand.\nThe 70-year-old priest has been suspended from Our Lady Queen of Angels Parish in Somerset County. He's charged with traveling abroad from 2004 to 2009 to have sex with three young boys — a charge known as sexual tourism — and illegally transferring $8,000 to a charity to help fund the trips.\nA defense expert witness on Friday raised the possibility that investigators' questioning prompted alleged victims — now all men in their 20s — to levy false accusations.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T15:27:52.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
