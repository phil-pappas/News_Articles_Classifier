Unfortunately many people do not sleep well and according to Dr. Michael Breus, diplomat of the American Board of Sleep Medicine, fellow of The American Academy of Sleep Medicine and consulting sleep doctor to Six Senses, poor sleep over a period of months and years is associated with long-term health consequences such as heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes.\nThere are several things that a person who struggles to get a good night’s can do to increase the quality of their sleep. Tips include going to bed at the same time each evening, consistency reinforces the body’s sleep-wake cycle; setting your thermostat to 72 degrees Fahrenheit (23 degrees Celsius) for the ideal ‘night’ temperature and energy savings and making sure your bedroom is completely dark since nightlights, phones and alarm clocks disturb natural melatonin production.\nAlso topping the list for optimizing sleep is the quality of the mattress you sleep on and your choice of linens. At Six Senses Hotels Resorts Spas, great efforts have been made to deliver the best possible night’s rest to guests and the group identified the highest quality, handmade natural fiber bed on the market that is also made based on sustainable practices and components – Naturalmat. The Six Senses bed created by Naturalmat is a mattress and topper combination made with entirely natural and organic materials all from renewable and sustainable sources. All Naturalmat mattresses are handcrafted from their premises on the banks of the River Exe in Devon, UK.\nThe Six Senses mattress has a supportive core made from hand nested individual pocket springs in cotton casings, these are then sandwiched between generous layers of natural latex. Latex is a wonderful material for a mattress, it is produced from the sap of the Hevea rubber tree so is a natural and sustainable resource, its inherent elasticity allows it to adapt and support your body and it is also inherently hypoallergenic. Finally, the mattress is tufted in organic lambs wool. Naturalmat source all of the wool for their mattresses from Soil Association certified organic farms within a 50 mile (80 kilometer) radius of the factory. Wool is the perfect natural insulator, its complex structure of fibers allows it to wick moisture away from the body ensuring even body temperature maintenance – keeping you cool in the summer and warm in the winter.\nThe Six Senses topper adds a wonderful soft and sumptuous top layer to the mattress. It has a natural cotton core that is made with the recycled shredded off cuts from jeans factories. The cotton layer is then sandwiched in between luxurious layers of our locally sourced organic lambs wool.\nThe mattress and topper combination would not be complete without a Naturalmat bed base. All bases are traditionally made using FSC timber, which is constructed using solid corner pieces and all components are glued and screwed together to make a really strong and long lasting bed base. The base is then upholstered with organic coconut fiber and the surface is tufted with organic lambs wool so that they are all supremely comfortable and provide excellent ventilation all around the mattress.\nFounded in Devon, England in 2000 when Mark Tremlett and Peter Tindall, both keen sailors, became frustrated with the poor quality mattresses found on boats. The synthetic fibers being used were not allowing the mattresses to ‘breathe’ so they became damp and musty. With only synthetic mattresses available, Mark and Peter decided to look for an alternative. Natural fibers were found to be a superior substitute due to their breathable nature, allowing air to circulate through the mattress keeping it dry and clean. Natural fibers also proved to be more durable and supportive ensuring an all-round, high quality mattress – the natural mat. The business expanded from yachting to the baby market when Mark’s first child was born in 2001 and now includes a line of baby and adult mattresses, beds, toppers, bedding and furniture.\nMark Tremlett said, “We are delighted to be working with Six Senses and making Naturalmat mattresses for all their resorts. It is a perfect fit for our company due to Six Senses strong commitment to sustainability and wellness. We also have a continual commitment towards sustainable development and waste management. This is why all raw materials that we use come from 100 percent renewable and sustainable sources so that they can be recycled once they have come to the end of their product life and to overall divert waste from landfills. We continually review our business to ensure that we make the most comfortable beds and mattresses from the most environmentally friendly natural resources and that we try to achieve this with the lowest carbon footprint.”\nNaturalmat beds are featured at Six Senses Douro Valley which opened in July and will be available at all new locations. The Six Senses Naturalmat bed is already featured at Six Senses Zighy Bay in Oman and over the next few years, beds will be replaced with Naturalmat mattresses globally. Guests interested in experiencing the Six Senses Sleep Program, can contact their Six Senses property of choice in advance of their arrival to inquire about the availability of the new bed.\nGuests interested in purchasing a Six Senses Naturalmat mattress can place their order at any of the resorts currently featuring the mattresses – Six Senses Douro Valley in Portugal and Six Senses Zighy Bay in Oman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T12:04:03.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
