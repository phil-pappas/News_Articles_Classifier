Mauna Kea Golf Course on Hawaii’s Big Island is a bucket-list track, and the famous third hole — 272 yards from the tips, but 179 from the tee-box for a player of my ilk — has been on my mind since before leaving Calgary for this tropical getaway. \nA four-hybrid into the ocean breeze leaves the ball six feet from the cup, and a two-putt earns a three on the scorecard. Yeah, a birdie would have been nice, but scoring par on such an iconic hole feels almost as good. \nYes, Mauna Kea’s signature hole is every bit as advertised. In fact, the whole track, which plays 7,370 yards from the tips and 5,096 yards from the shortest of five tee-box options, is unforgettable. \n“You’re not let down,” said Josh Silliman, director of golf at Mauna Kea Resort. “Your expectations are often exceeded just because of the experience on the golf course. \n“It’s one of those special things when you see peoples’ faces when they come in, especially when they haven’t come here before. \n“Its reputation precedes itself. Everybody’s excited to be here before they get here and once they play it, and you’re asking them the questions, ‘What did you think? How did it go?’ ... Most commonly, they talk about the bunkers and how they got beat up and how difficult it was, but they talk about how much fun it was to go out and see this beautiful scenery.” \nFor 50 years — ever since Laurance S. Rockefeller made the bold investment to build a scenic course on the lava fields on the Big Island’s coastline, commissioned Robert Trent Jones Sr. to design it and had Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Gary Player christen it — Mauna Kea has remained a standard for golf in Hawaii with its stunning views and challenging layout that features many elevated greens and 120 bunkers. \nWhile No. 3 was a success, I can attest it’s not your usual resort course. Par on any hole is an accomplishment. \n“When people ask, especially resort guests who don’t play golf, we explain to them this is more of a championship course,” Silliman said. “It’s just at a resort setting.” \nThe resort setting is more like it when you’re in the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel, nestled alongside the crescent-shaped beach in Kauna’oa Bay. \nRockefeller’s Mauna Kea course, which was redesigned by Rees Jones in 2008, is the granddaddy of Big Island courses. But it’s not the only one which makes a golf trip there worth every sun-soaked moment, especially for a land-locked Albertan looking for a reason to get away from the coming cold and snow, arriving at Kona International Airport though gateways such as Vancouver, Seattle, San Francisco or Los Angeles. \nWant more action near the coast? Try Mauna Lani, where the Francis H I’i Brown South Course hosted the Senior Skins Game for a decade and features a stunning Par-3 15th that must be one of the most photographed over-the-water holes in the world. \nThe same thing goes for the Hualalai Golf Course on the Four Seasons Resort, which is the first Jack Nicklaus signature design on the island, is home to the Champions Tour’s Mitsubishi Electric Championship and has a fantastic couple of finishing holes. \nAnd if you’re fortunate to know a member of the prestigious Kohanaiki Golf & Ocean Club, don’t pass up that opportunity to play this private gem. \nThe Waikoloa Beach Resort features the Beach Course along the water, another top-rated track on the island, but if you want to get a different feel, book a tee-time at the Kings’ Course set among the lava. \nIf you want a more panoramic view of the coast while on the links, the Nicklaus-designed Club at Hokulia — another members-only hangout — will have you breathing in the scenery from a higher altitude. \n“It’s sometimes hard to focus on your game because of the beauty of this island,” said Brendan Moynahan, director of golf at Hualalai Resort. “Golfers tend to pay less attention to their scores here, because they are enjoying the beauty of the place.” \nIt certainly is easy to become intoxicated by the beauty all around, be it by a hike to lava flows, a swim in the ocean, a whale-watching trip, stargazing atop Maunakea — the world’s tallest mountain as its base is the ocean floor — or the multitude of other activities to do in paradise. \nBut let’s be real, golfing on the Big Island is a must. Just be sure to relish the vistas, too. \n“You get to the tee-boxes on any course and you have that clear day when you can see the ocean and waves are crashing, but behind you is the terrain, the mountains, Mauna Loa, Mauna Kea ... When you look at that landscape, it takes you in,” said Kevin Ginoza, the head pro at Waikoloa Beach Resort. “You realize, ‘I’m in Hawaii.’ This great area, great weather and great golf course, it gives you that great moment. \n“You get here and you get revived and get back that zest for life.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T20:42:08.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
