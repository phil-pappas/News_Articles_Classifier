As well as the metro ads, the campaign is highlighting great flight and hotel offers through email marketing to hundreds of thousands of travellers throughout Italy on the eDreams database, as well as online advertising on the eDreams site.\nIn 2014, we welcomed about 253,000 Italian visitors to the island Ireland, up +9% on the previous year. Niamh Kinsella, Tourism Ireland’s manager in Italy, said: “Italy is an important market for tourism to the island of Ireland, and we have seen excellent growth in Italian visitors numbers again this year, with the latest CSO figures indicating growth of +17% for the May to July period. Tourism Ireland is determined to ensure that growth continues and we are rolling out a busy programme of promotions in Italy this autumn. Co-operative campaigns with key partners, like this one with eDreams, are an important element of that programme, to boost travel to Dublin and Ireland between now and the end of the year.”\nSource:- Tourism Ireland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T13:58:40.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
