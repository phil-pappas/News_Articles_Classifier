Last year, the event drew 61,416 visitors, including 34,745 runners, and generated direct spending of $84.5 million for the Las Vegas economy. This year, 51,000 runners are expected for the 5K, 10K, half-marathon and marathon races, with the number of visitors expected to top 100,000.\nIf the electronics industry can showcase its products at the Consumer Electronics Show and attract 170,000 visitors to Las Vegas every January, then maybe the endurance and fitness industries can do the same in Sin City in the autumn as the weather turns pleasant, Furlow thought.\nFurlow said Southern Nevada’s growing profile as an outdoor recreational and fitness tourism draw could motivate bicycle, crossfit, running, triathlon, hiking and rock-climbing industry promoters to work on a “two- week blitz” in Las Vegas to tap a demographic of 30 million active lifestyle residents in the U.S.\n“What will drive revenue will be volume of visitors,” Furlow said. “We can cross-pollinate our databases. …\nYou can assemble an endurance lifestyle play.”\nLas Vegas has an impressive lineup of major fitness and endurance events in the next few months that can be drivers in assembling a fitness tourism multi-day or multi-week super-show.\nFor example, an international cyclocross bicycle race called “CrossVegas” is being staged at Desert Breeze Park on Sept. 16. Some 10,000 fans are expected to watch the race, including many bicycle industry visitors in Las Vegas at the time for the Interbike national bicycle trade show at Mandalay Bay Convention Center Sept. 16-18. About 25,000 Interbike visitors are expected to spend about $31.5 million in the Las Vegas economy, according to Interbike.\nFurlow has contacts in the bicycle industry from working for the Tour of California bicycle race, which is owned by Los Angeles-based Anschutz Entertainment Group. AEG is also partnering with MGM Resorts International on the $375 million arena that is scheduled to open on the Strip in April.\nMarkets typically like triathlons because this endurance event draws affluent participants who have money to travel, stay in hotels, eat at local restaurants and buy high-end equipment.\nHenderson has been active in trying to market the city as a destination for triathlons, with neighboring Lake Mead National Recreation Area providing a scenic setting and challenging course for the event’s three legs.\nIn 2010, the Silverman triathlon had an economic impact of $5.2 million in the city of Henderson on items such as hotel rooms and restaurant dining, the city said. In 2011-2013, when the event was a world championship triathlon, it had an estimated annual economic impact of $15 million.\nWhile the Strip receives most of the pop culture attention, Las Vegas can be an attractive lure for outdoor and fitness tourists because scenery at places such as Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area, Mount Charleston and Valley of Fire State Park is inspiring. Even the River Mountains Loop Trail, a 35-mile paved, hilly trail that goes through the cities of Boulder City and Henderson and the Lake Mead national site, has been written about in the New York Times travel section.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T23:08:11.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
