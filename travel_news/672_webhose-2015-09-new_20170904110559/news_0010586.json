Today the Topkapi Palace is a UNESCO world heritage site and serves as a museum for holy relics and significant artifacts. Comprised of four main courtyards and many smaller buildings, at it’s peak the royal compound was home to as many as 4,000 people. The most popular area on the premises is the Imperial Harem, which was said to be the private chambers for the Sultan’s mother, wives and family. The colorful rooms and detailed walls are an incredible sight. Moving through different sections of the palace, you can discover the kitchen facilities, imperial furnishings and even the Sultans weaponry. And perhaps the most alluring of all, within the treasury section, you can see the royal jewels, including the unbelievable 86-carrot spoonmaker’s diamond. Within the beautifully constructed pavilions and gardens of the fourth courtyard, you will find the Sultan’s private sanctuary. With amazing views of the city, it’s a fitting feature for such an amazing place. Whether you’re into history, architecture or just appreciate living lavishly, the Topkapi Palace is a must-see stop the next time you’re in Istanbul.
