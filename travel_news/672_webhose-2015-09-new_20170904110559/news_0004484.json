July capacity increased by 6.5%, and load factor rose 1.4 percentage points to 83.6%. Results were given a boost by the timing of Ramadan which fell partly in July this year but took place mostly in July in 2014. The holy month tends to subdue demand for air travel.\n“July results were strongly positive but slowing global trade and the wild gyrations of stock exchanges around the globe suggest that we may be in for some turbulence in coming months,” said Tony Tyler, IATA’s Director General and CEO.\nJuly 2015 vs. July 2014 RPK Growth ASK Growth PLF International 8.6% 6.5% 83.5 Domestic 7.6% 6.5% 83.6 Total Market 8.2% 6.5% 83.6 YTD 2015 vs. YTD 2015 RPK Growth ASK Growth PLF International 6.6% 6.2% 79.4 Domestic 6.4% 5.7% 81.2 Total Market 6.5% 6.0% 80.1 International Passenger Markets\nJuly international passenger demand rose 8.6% compared to the same month in 2014, with airlines in all regions recording growth, including Africa for the first time this year.

Capacity rose 6.5% and load factor climbed 1.5 percentage points to 80.3%.
