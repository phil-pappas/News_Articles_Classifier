Off-licence shops offering cheaper drinks than established bar and club venues in the area have sparked impromptu street parties, while drug dealers are said to patrol street corners. Corrupt police are feared to be ‘looking the other way’, paid off by local gangs controlling the drugs market. But earlier this year, a major drugs network was said to have been \"eradicated\" in Lan Kwai Fong, the South China Morning Post reports. Rubbish on the streets of Hong Kong Photo: EPA Last week, a video of a drunken 22-year-old British woman sitting topless, covered in white paint and touching her breasts on a street in Hong Kong caused outrage. Alice Stirrat, who moved to Hong Kong four months ago to work for a fashion company, appeared to be saying “Sozzle, sozzle me” in what was said to be a Chinese accent in the video clip filmed by her friend Emma Stubbs who was also covered in white paint. A picture of Ms Stirrat laying against a wall wearing hot pants and covered in paint was also shared with the video on WhatsApp. “The majority of the drunken nonsense is definitely centred on Lan Kwai Fong, which has gone right downhill in the last couple of years. When I was there a few weeks ago, it was carnage – the street looked filthy. Drunken men and women – not just Britons either – were sprawled on pavements. Cheap shots are advertised everywhere, and the police even raided the bar I was in, for licensing purposes” said Telegraph Travel’s Lee Cobaj, who grew up in Hong Kong. \"Lan Kwai Fong has always had this reputation though,\" said Telegraph Travel's Hong Kong expert Fionnuala McHugh, \"which is why I tend to avoid it and don't recommend it. It's a curious beast: it's extremely heavily policed on certain holiday nights e.g. Halloween, a legacy of the tragedy that happened in the early hours of January 1 1993, when at least 21 people died in a crowd crush.\" The video clip of Alice Stirrat sitting on a street in Hong Kong \"But police seem to be reluctant to interfere when expats are misbehaving, which is a colonial legacy. A lot of the police here don't speak English and don't want to get involved. I hear this all the time from people astonished that no action is taken,\" she added. \"This place is basically the Magaluf of Hong Kong,” Melody De Paul, who recently began her studies in Hong Kong, told The Sun. “It’s really dirty and there are street parties every night,” she added. More than 20,000 Britons are said to currently live in Hong Kong, and many of them are said to be single, young professionals following the “ work hard, play hard\" expat way of life filled with drinking, drugs and sex, according to Peter Gordon, a 40-year-old Britsh expat who moved to Hong Kong nearly 10 years ago. Tourists and businessmen alike can be commonly seen drunk and vomiting around the streets of Lan Kwai Fong, while others access sex workers in Wan Chai, Mr Gordon told The Sun. A sex worker in Wan Chai's 'red light district' Photo: EPA One British banker, who has been working in Hong Kong for five years but did not wished to be named, said the party lifestyle among British expats “goes on all the time.” “Some of these guys are on footballers’ wages, so they love to show off their wealth by having bottle after bottle brought over to their tables,” while others are said to be “entertaining clients in strip clubs, casual sex between boozy expats or with the locals, or even sleazy parties with hookers” he told The Sun. But expats’ drunken acts are said to be offensive to traditional Chinese culture. Public nudity is insulting to Chinese people and could be punished with six months' jail time, experts told The Sun, referring to the video clip of Ms Stirrat. “It’s [Ms Stirrat’s behaviour] crazy, horrible. Hong Kong, as a part of China, has a conservative culture, so doing something like that on the street with paint all over yourself like that is just not acceptable in Chinese society.“ Lo Chung-yan, a 33-year-old social worker, told The Sun. People have always \"partied hard\" in Hong Kong but the drunken behaviour is not seen across the entire island and has not reached the levels witnessed in Magaluf, notes Ms Cobaj. \"Although Lan Kwai Fong is a bit of a mess, the madness really is restricted to that one street – and it’s nowhere near as bad as Magaluf. There are still hundreds of gorgeous bars for a glam night out in Hong Kong” she added. Drunken behaviour among Britons abroad has been commonly reported in Magaluf, where British police have been deployed to clamp down on the bad behaviour of British tourists at the Majorcan party resort, patrolling the nightlife hub of Punta Ballena. Last year, Balearic authorities declared it was aiming to transform the notorious resort into a “ mature tourist destination \" by introducing new curbs on anti-social behaviour and an overhaul of hotels in a bid to attract a more upmarket crowd.
