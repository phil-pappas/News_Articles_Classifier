The Scottish Government will continue to support this ambition.”\nPauline Howie, Chief Executive, Scottish Ambulance Service said:\n“SCOTSTAR brings together the specialist clinical skills and transport resources required to transfer clinically ill patients in a way that is unique in the UK. Bringing the teams together into one central base ensures that the most appropriate specialist clinical care can be arranged promptly to meet the needs of patients across Scotland. ScotSTAR delivers a genuinely world class service for these patients.\nLast year, SCOTSTAR teams responded to 2,654 cases, of which 491 were by air, where specialist, highly skilled, clinical teams were required to manage the care of patients during transport. These specialised retrievals are clinically complex and take much longer than a normal emergency response.\nSource:- Glasgow Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T21:12:03.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
