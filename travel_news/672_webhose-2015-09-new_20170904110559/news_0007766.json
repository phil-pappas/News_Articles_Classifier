The new flight is the second international route for Proflight Zambia and follows the launch of two domestic flights from Lusaka to Kitwe and Kafue National Park this year. \n“Proflight’s new international destination brings opportunities to both cities because it offers travelers more access for both business and leisure. Durban is one of the most important destinations in the region for trade and leisure, and this flight offers good connectivity with our domestic flights too,” says Captain Phillip Lemba, Director of Government and Industry Affairs at Proflight Zambia. \nThe new Proflight route was officially marked with a celebration at the World Routes aviation conference in Durban attended by Provincial Minister for Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs Michael Mabuyakhalu and the Mayor of Durban Cllr. James Nxumalo. \nDurban is South Africa’s second most important manufacturing hub after Johannesburg with the presence of a number of major multi-national companies and it is also famous for being the busiest port in the African continent. \nStarting from September 22, 2015, Proflight will fly three times a week to Durban using its 50-seater CRJ-100 aircraft. \nFlight P0024 will leave Lusaka at 11:00hrs on Tuesdays, Thursday’s and Saturdays, arriving in Durban at 13:30hrs. The returning P0025 flight will leave Durban at 14:10hrs on Tuesdays and Thursdays and arrive in Lusaka at 16:40hrs. On Sundays P0023 will leave Durban- at 12:00hrs and arrive back in Lusaka at 14:30hrs. \nSouth Africa as a growing market continues to play an important part in Proflight’s international network expansion strategy. \nTravellers from Lusaka and elsewhere in Proflight’s extensive network will be able to attend to business in Durban, go shopping, visit the sea and spend time on the beach, visit family and friends, go to concerts and shows, and attend rugby, football and cricket matches. \nThe new service will also enable South Africa visitors to more easily visit Lusaka for business and to enjoy Zambia’s tourist attractions. \nThe new Durban flight also provides smooth connections with Proflight’s services between Lusaka and Ndola, Kitwe, Solwezi and Mfuwe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T20:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T23:40:56.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
