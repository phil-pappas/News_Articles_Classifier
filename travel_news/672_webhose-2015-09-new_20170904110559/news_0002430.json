Puppet shows in Jaipur have left no villages, social gatherings, fairs, festival occasions or ant monument there. The puppeteer along with his company of singers and instrument players reveals how incredible India is and how gallant its kings used to be in the history. \nWhen our heart goes on the walk of past, it reminds the days bygone. None can deny the fact that technology has been gripping our lives with its claws. It has changed our lifestyle, the way we behave and also, the sources of our entertainment. Once upon a day when street plays (Nukkad Natak), circus, bioscope and dance show (nautanki) used to make people crazy for them. \nHow folk songs took birth? \nFrom a child to laymen, all used to rush for catching a glimpse of still pictures on bioscope. Nothing but the pure craze should be the appropriate phrase for that gesture. In agro nations, like India, the peasants too had the greatest time pass and that was ‘singing’. Yesterdays’ songs sung by locals have been riding on the popularity chart as famous folk songs today. \nInception of Puppet Shows \nThe palace of the kings used to be the theatre where the dancers and story tellers from the locals were called. They were sick of hearing the tale of their courage. Perhaps, it was the only way for bragging about their gallantry or bravery that they had shown during war or battle. Or, it could be the trick to inspire the onlookers to be brave. And when their adventurous venture was blended with melodies produced from Ektara, Daphali, harmonium and other musical instruments, it gave birth to folk songs and folk music. Meanwhile, puppet show was evolved as the mean of entertainment in Rajasthan. \nModern technology steals the show \nThe time changed swiftly. Inventions and technology have added new definitions to entertainment. LEDs, TV, Radios, Smartphones, iPads and computers have magnetized everyone towards them. Puppet shows have lost their charm with the passage of time. But it is the magic of incredible India and its rich culture that ties all its lovers and freaks together. Tourists from across the globe hit Jaipur irrespective of boundaries for catching live shows of puppets. \nEtymology of ‘Kathputli’ and its carving \n‘Kath’ stands for wood and ‘Putli’ is puppet in Hindi language. The puppets in Jaipur are made of wood. Attracted puppets are carved out of wood. Each limb of the puppet is made separately. Subsequently, the dexterous hands of a ‘Kathputli maker’ or puppeteer join puppet’s all parts together in a doll shape. He cleverly makes its all parts movable with the string. Thereafter, the splash of colours and lovely print fabrics’ drape make them eye-catching. The credit of keeping this traditional art alive goes to Bhat community. This community wins accolades in every village fair, Hawa Mahal, religious festivals and social gatherings by showcasing puppet shows. \nWhy puppet shows miss the beat? \nThe puppeteer does not perform alone the entire puppet show. Dholak-player, a whistler and the singers accompany him. The curtain rises up with the beat of Dholak and whistle on the stage. The most famous puppet themes are the tale of Amar Singh Rathore who hailed from Nagpur and Simhasan Battisi of Raja Vikramaditya who belonged to Ujjain. The rhythmic and musical narration of this tales guarantees to take away millions of hearts in one hour.
