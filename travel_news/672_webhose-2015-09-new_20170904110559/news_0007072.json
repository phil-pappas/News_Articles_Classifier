Also expected to be high on customer's agenda at the show is Dassault's big new ultra-long range Falcon 8X trijet, set to begin deliveries next year. Dassault anticipates strong demand for this latest model, introduced last year as the new flagship of the Falcon family. The 6,450 nm/11,945 km 8X will offer the greatest range and the longest cabin of any Falcon, allowing it to take passengers from Moscow to Los Angeles , Cape Town or Rio de Janeiro non-stop. The new aircraft will also offer the largest selection of cabin configurations in business aviation and the same low operating economics and remarkable operating flexibility for which all Falcons are known.\nDassault is one of the leading suppliers of high-end business jets in Russia and the CIS, with one third of the large cabin market. More than 50 Falcons have been delivered to customers in the region over the last decade, most of them long range Falcon 7X and 900 trijets. The three-engine design ensures additional safety and operating margin, making it possible to fly direct routes over water and inhospitable terrain, saving time and money.\n\"Falcons are universally appreciated for their large and quiet cabin, unmatched performance, economy and operating flexibility,\" says Dassault Aviation Chairman and CEO, Eric Trappier . \"The 8X and 5X will continue with this storied tradition.\"\nRussia and the neighboring CIS countries are a key market for Dassault. Operators in the region enthusiastically support business aviation for their domestic and international operations. As evidenced by the heavy investments it has made to its regional support network in recent years, the company expects long term prospects to remain bright despite the soft present market.\nThe Falcon fleet is exceptionally young - less than six years on average - reflecting the large number of new aircraft that have entered service in Russia and the CIS in recent years. Half of Falcons in operation in the region are 7Xs, which recently passed the 250 production mark - the fastest any Falcon has ever reached this milestone.\nOn the twinjet end, demand is expected to be strong for the new 5X as well as the Falcon 2000LXS, the newest version in the storied Falcon 2000 family.\nThe 5,200 nm/9,630 km 5X will offer the highest and widest cabin on the market, yet provide sufficient range to fly from Moscow to New York or Hong Kong nonstop. The Falcon 2000LXS combines the best blend of airport flexibility, cabin comfort and efficiency in the 4,000 nm segment. Certificated in early 2013, the rugged 2000LXS is perfect for operations in and out of the many small airfields that dot the Russian landscape.\n\"The success of the Falcon line in the Russian region stems from their robustness, advanced design and fuel efficiency says Gilles Gautier , Vice President, Falcon Sales for Dassault Aviation. \"These features make them perfect for the vast expanse and rugged conditions of the Russian marketplace.\"\nIn addition to the Falcon lineup, the Dassault stand will highlight Falcon Response, Dassault's new AOG support service. Offered through Dassault Falcon Service Moscow, the company's regional satellite service center, Falcon Response can expedite a Vnukovo-based Go Team around the clock to deal with an aircraft on ground situation. If need be, it can call on a dedicated Falcon 900 AOG support aircraft based in Paris-Le Bourget to expedite parts, tools and repair teams. The airplane can also provide alternative lift for customers who require it.\nNotes for Editors\nDassault Falcon is the recognized global brand for Dassault business jets which are designed, manufactured and supported by Dassault Aviation and Dassault Falcon Jet Corp.\nAbout Dassault Aviation\nDassault Aviation is a leading aerospace company with a presence in over 90 countries across five continents.
