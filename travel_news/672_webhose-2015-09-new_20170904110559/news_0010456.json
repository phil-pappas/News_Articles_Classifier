In the ‘60s, the designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac frequented Montana — and soon it became, as it is today, one of Paris ’s most exclusive clubs.\nThis August, the Montana’s latest owner, Jean-Yves Le Fur, who also owns Lui Magazine, unveiled a new boutique hotel and restaurant, called Le Gauche Cavier, in the seven-story building above the club. He recruited the architect Elizabeth Lemercier and the design darling Vincent Darré to outfit it. They chose to knock down all interior walls to create just a single suite on each floor; as a result the suites are universally spacious and light-filled.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage By Design: The Wild World of Vincent Darré SEPT. 24, 2015 Darré approached the brief in his usual audacious maximalist manner, casting each floor in a wildly different theme inspired by some of his favorite Parisian artists and figures. The first floor suite, “Gris Paris,” pays homage to the French artist Christian Berard — it features Surrealist-style furniture from his own line, Maison Darré, and fabrics adorned with drawings by French illustrator Pierre Le-Tan. The third-floor “Bleu Acide\" suite is a nod to Braque and Picasso: with hand-painted Picasso-esque panels lining the walls and rich blue furnishings. The beds in each of the rooms are custom-made, as are some wallpapers and carpets that Darré designed in collaboration with the rug maker Codimat.\n“Wherever you travel in the world, hotels always have the same decoration, so I wanted this to feel like you are actually in Paris,” says Darré. “Like an eccentric friend gave you a key to his apartment.” The only constant throughout the rooms are the bathrooms: all of them are covered with slick black tiling. “They’re very Gainsbourg,” Darré says with a laugh. “A little naughty… But I think the people who stay in this hotel are a little rock and roll.”", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/24/t-magazine/24tmag-darre-t-1/27tmag-10arena_darre-t_CA0-thumbStandard.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-29T01:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T02:07:30.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
