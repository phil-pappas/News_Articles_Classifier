The first thing you need to do is find the right bike for your body and for your needs. There are several different types of bicycles, the one you choose depends on the kind of biking you’re going to be doing. If you plan on doing mostly road biking, there are bikes built specifically for that purpose. They have thin, smooth tires and are generally more lightweight than other kinds of bicycles. Curt Ellerbee of San Diego prefers this type of bike for his 7 mile commute to his highly successful law firm. If you enjoy nature and want to try off-road biking, then you’ll need a mountain bike. With wider tires and stronger tread, they also are built for better shock absorption since you’ll be encountering bumps along the way. A hard-tail mountain bike is less expensive but offers less shock absorption under the seat. A full-suspension bike is going to cost more, but will have a bit more absorption than the hard-tail. If some light aerobic exercise is all you really need, consider purchasing a comfort bike, made with 26 inch, wider wheels. The seat is a bit lower than the handle bars which makes for a more comfortable, albeit less aerodynamic, pedaling position. If you are a woman, they do make bikes that are sized for a woman’s typical proportion of longer leg length to torso ratio. But whether you are male or female, the proper sizing of a bike is important to prevent painful rides. Go to a local bike shop and get their help determining what size frame you need, as well as where your handlebars and seat should be positioned. Cycling is a great way to protect the environment and get a great aerobic exercise that’s easy on your body. When you go to buy your bike, be sure to do your research, and be willing to put in a decent investment on a bike. Get the proper bike for your size and needs and you’ll be hitting the road (or trail) in no time.
