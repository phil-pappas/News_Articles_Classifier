The aircraft has met or surpassed all design goals, exceeding targets such as range, runway performance, hot-and-high takeoff distance and maximum payload. Conclusion of the process in Europe follows the recent certification granted by the Brazil and U.S. aviation agencies.\n“This is a great achievement that paves the way for deliveries to begin in the member states of the European Union as well as in EASA-associated countries,” said Marco Tulio Pellegrini, President & CEO of Embraer Executive Jets. “The Legacy 450 is a revolutionary business jet that re-enforces our commitment to deliver true innovation to the market.”\nWith a range of up to 2,575 nautical miles (4,769 km), the mid-light Legacy 450 can fly nonstop from New York to Las Vegas, Dubai to Moscow and Jakarta to Hong Kong. The aircraft has the largest cabin in its class, comfortable seating for up to 9 passengers, and is the first jet in its category to replace conventional controls with full digital fly-by-wire technology.\nProduction of the Legacy 450 has already begun and the first delivery is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T01:51:31.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
