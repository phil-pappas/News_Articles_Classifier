This only applies to people older than 16 years.\n“The normal daily quota at the gates will still apply during that week and preference will be given based on first come first served basis. Know your parks and fall in love with conserving nature,” Mketeni said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T01:25:27.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
