Drybar’s Bay Breeze Hydrating Shots promise burst of hair moisture \nRehydrates your hair from roots to ends \nHas ingredients like sage leaf extract and apricot kernel oil \nFree of parabens, sulfates and phthalates Drybar Order Reprint of this Story \nDrybar, a salon that specializes in blowouts and markets itself as the nation’s premier blow-dry bar, recently expanded its comprehensive line of professional haircare products to include a new item called Bay Breeze Hydrating Shots. \nDesigned for all hair types, the single-use treatments reportedly rehydrate dull, dry hair by adding long-lasting moisture. Used weekly, the treatments are supposed to help hair stay silky-soft and shiny. \nMade with ingredients like sage leaf extract, carob seed extract and apricot kernel oil, Bay Breeze Hydrating Shots come in 8-ounce bottles that can be purchased separately ( $10 at Sephora ) or in a set of four for a full month of treatment ( $38 at Sephora ). \nAlso included is a reusable spray cap to help apply the product.  ; First impression \nFollowing the instructions, I washed my hair and removed as much excess water as I could before beginning the application process. \nAs I worked it through my long hair, section by section, I began to worry that the tiny bottle didn’t have enough product for full coverage. To ensure that I would, I ended up popping off the spray cap and shaking every last drop out of the bottle. \nAfter leaving the treatment on my hair for five minutes, I rinsed it off and then followed up with my usual conditioner. In total, the process took less than 10 minutes. Fab or flub? \nFab! When it comes to restoring moisture to your hair, Drybar’s Bay Breeze Hydrating Shots deliver in a big way. \nApplied weekly, the easy-to-use treatments have helped my hair maintain a healthier look and feel. Bay Breeze Hydrating Shots produce instant results, so if I feel like my hair is starting to look overworked, I apply a treatment and my hair is immediately silkier than before. \nAnd unlike some deep conditioning treatments I’ve tried in the past, Bay Breeze Hydrating Shots do not leave my thick hair looking greasy or feeling weighed down. \nIf you’re looking to transform hair that has been wrecked by chemicals or hot styling tools, I highly recommend giving this product a try.
