Because rain is constantly sweeping the back of the valley and mixing with sun beaming down the front of the valley, the result is ridiculous rainbows all the time.”\nAs for best rainbow-watching in the area, Deanna says the higher you go, the better. Take a panoramic cruise, for example, along Tantalus Drive , which spits you out at Puu Ualaokua Park lookout point, offering views of Diamond Head and Punchbowl Crater. Or try hiking along Waahila ridge , on Manoa’s east side, which peers down over neighboring Palolo Valley. Stellar rainbow views all around—and if you’re lucky, you may even witness a circular rainbow , something only visible from way above.\nOne travel writer who grew up in Hawaii recalls childhood car trips down Pali Highway, and the illusion of \"driving through\" rainbows. “At least, that’s what my parents called it when we were kids. No matter what, there are beautiful views, with or without rainbows.”\nFor more information on weather patterns around the different islands, check out this guide on the best time to visit Hawaii.\n© Provided by TIME Inc.
