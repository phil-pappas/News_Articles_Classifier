In fact, our member booking activity is testament that the GDS levy isn’t working. \n“The good news for airlines who recognise and support TMCs is that Lufthansa is handing corporate travel bookings to them. The changes from Lufthansa may have been rooted in trying to solve cost challenges for the airline, however they haven’t addressed what corporate customers and business passengers want,” he added. \nEarlier this month, Lufthansa said charging a €16 fee for all GDS bookings is in the “best interests” of customers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T15:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T15:06:32.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
