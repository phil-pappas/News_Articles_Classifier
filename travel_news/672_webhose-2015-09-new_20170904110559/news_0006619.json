The public area has been occupied by street vendors for more than 30 years. \nKhlong Ong Ang was registered as a historical site by the Fine Arts Department. \nThe canal, about 500 metres long, is on the outskirts of the old town area which links Phra Nakhon and Samphanthawong districts. \nThe public area along the canal which used to measure about seven to eight metres wide has been taken over by trading stalls and booths, narrowing the walkway down to just one metre. \nMr Vichai said City Hall has been working with Phra Nakhon and Samphanthawong district offices over the past two months, to seek a solution to clean up the area. \nStreet vendors in the area have taken over the public space and illegally built trading booths over the canal, he said. \nOnce the area is cleaned up, City Hall will develop the area into a new tourist attraction, Mr Vichai said. \nWater transport will also be brought back to life at the canal. \nThe adviser said many of the 500 vendors in the area have agreed to move out. \nThe BMA has also prepared new trading space for them at the Khlong Thom Centre, a market at the old southern bus terminal, behind Pata Pinklao, or Talad Tha Din Deang. \nA vendor contemplates her store at Saphan Lek, which she must pack up and vacate within 15 days. (Photos by Patipat Janthong) \nPramern Krairos, Phra Nakhon district's assistant director, said the office will work with the Crown Property Bureau to control the illegal structures. \nAny buildings along Khlong Ong Ang found to be illegally extended into the canal or footpath will have to be demolished, he said. \nSome traders in the area said yesterday they have not yet been officially informed the city intends regulating the area, but would be willing to cooperate when they are. \nGet full Bangkok Post printed newspaper experience on your digital devices with Bangkok Post e-newspaper .
