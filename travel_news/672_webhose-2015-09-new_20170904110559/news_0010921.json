The newest member of the Typhoon family is designed to provide smooth and stable aerial footage for the crisp GoPro ® camera. In addition, the Typhoon G continues to deliver Yuneec's standard of being ready, easy and safe for consumers everywhere.\nThe Typhoon G has several smart features that ensure safety and ease of use, which consumers have come to expect from the Typhoon series. Features such as Geo-Fencing, Speed Control, Dynamic Return to Home, Follow Me and Watch Me are built into the Typhoon G system.\nWe believe the Typhoon G will be the aerial and ground imaging solution of choice for GoPro® enthusiasts because it provides the most stable imaging available,\" said Tian Yu , CEO of Yuneec USA .\nThe new GB203 3-axis self-stabilizing gimbal is designed especially for the GoPro ® Hero3 TM and above. It can be mounted on the Typhoon multicopter and on the SteadyGrip TM ground handle - a device that ensures ground shots are as smooth as those taken from the air. While flying the Typhoon G, real-time image transmission is achieved with the included MK58 digital video downlink module and can be viewed on the ST10+ ground station. The SteadyGrip TM uses up to a 6.4-inch mobile device as a display, and features camera pitch control for precise camera angle control on-the-go.\nTyphoon G is made for the GoPro ® user, and comes ready-to-fly in a color box with a ST10+ ground station, a handheld SteadyGrip TM for stable ground footage, one battery and a smart charger for the suggested retail price of $999.99 USD .
