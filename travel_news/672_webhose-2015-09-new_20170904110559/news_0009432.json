The Latin name, Amorphophallus titanum, translates to \"huge deformed penis,\" according to the Royal Botanic Gardens & Domain Trust.\nAfter that first bloom, it can take another two or more years to bloom again. And when it does, it blooms for about 24 to 36 hours and smells pretty darn stinky.\nWhy does it smell so stinky? The Chicago Botanic Garden credits \"a combination of dimethyl trisulfide, isovaleric acid, dimethyl disulfide, benzyl alcohol, indole, and trimethylamine.\"\nThe plant is trying to lure carrion beetles and flesh flies (up to an acre away) that are attracted to the smell of decomposition. The insects bring pollen from other plants they've visited, thereby pollinating the corpse flower plant.\nThe scent is most powerful at night.\nJUST WATCHED Rare 'Corpse Flower' blooms Replay More Videos ...
