Sheesh! I guess park it over there in the corner, next to the $20 or $30 million in TV money.”\nNote to U-Dub Regents: Seriously, isn’t this the tipping point at which you consider channeling some of that endless athletic cash flow to ordinary, debt-amassing, student non-athletes?\nAnd to Alaska: Failing the above, imagine the goodwill you might have created by diverting half that money to an all-new U-Dub partnership that includes a scholarship endowment for non-student-athlete children of employees or contractors. We’re guessing that many of your ground crews are immigrant families who truly could use the boost.\nSpeaking of Academia: So sad to see three instructors at Washington State University getting trashed for banning clearly “oppressive or hateful” terms , including in one case “male” and “female,” from Gender and Race Studies courses. Our advice: Head west, folks. Y’all will fit right in among the PC-obsessed Seattle left wing, which would stand and watch its own house burn to the ground rather than risk being perceived as flame-exclusionary.\nHave Grudge, Will Travel: Walking psychological study/state legislator Pam Roach, R-WWE, a longtime South King County dweller, is establishing convenient residency in Sumner for a planned 2016 run for the Pierce County Council . You know where all this is heading: Sooner or later, she’ll be starting at middle linebacker for the Bellevue High School football team.\nThis Week’s Walla Walla Onion Headline: Local “strategy consultant” DJ Wilson, writing on Crosscut.com last week, listed all the reasons Gov. Jay Inslee, D-Lean Management, should run for president. (The best one: “In short, Inslee has the time.”) So nice to see comedy writing gaining a foothold in Seattle.\nAnd Finally: Orthopedic surgeons worked overtime last week after all the swift, knee-jerk responses from local editorial writers urging a possible name change for Mount Rainier in the wake of President Obama’s renaming of Alaska’s Mount McKinley to Denali. Sorry, apples and oranges. The driving force behind the McKinley change — widespread, local usage of “Denali” — does not exist here, at least outside the Inferiority-Complex Committee in Tacoma. Unlike McKinley, Rainier has carved out its own place in the local lexicon and culture that wholly overshadows the person it was named for. Move along.\nRon Judd’s column appears each Sunday.
