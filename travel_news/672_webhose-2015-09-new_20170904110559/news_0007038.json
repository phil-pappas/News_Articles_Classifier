That's why I often bring my bike along on road trips. Recently, on the way back from Mukdahan, the northeastern city on the border with Laos, I spared a half-day to explore Phu Mhu, a hill with scenic lookout points in Nikhom Kham Soi, which is just a short drive from the provincial capital, with my two-wheeled buddy. \nInstead of going there directly, the plan was to first check out a nearby mount, Phu Pha Phueng that, assuming from what appears on Google Earth, could be seen from the top of Phu Mhu. Imagine how rewarding it would be to stand at the viewpoint, looking out at other hills that dominate the vista and being aware that you have been on one of them before. \nI started the ride from the huge building of Nikhom Kham Soi Tambon Municipality, an unmistakable landmark in the area, and followed the road in front of it to Huai Khi Lek dam just a little over 2km away. At the dam, I could see Phu Mhu not so far away on the other side of the reservoir. \nI continued along the ridge of the dam and after just 2km from there found a side road to the left with signs saying that it's the way to Na Kok Forest Plantation and the office of Dong Bang-e Forest Park. What they didn't say was that both of those places are located on Phu Pha Phueng and that the road leads to Pha Kew, the cliff where you can see the narrow point where the foothills of Phu Pha Phueng and an adjacent hill, Phu Phaeng Ma, connect. \nAfter a short while the road took me up the hill to a Buddhist monastery where it seemed to end. That wasn't right so I backtracked out of the entrance. Voila, what seemed like nothing more than a rocky slope next to the temple wall was actually the beginning of an off-road trail to Pha Kew! \nThe rocky surface quickly gave way to dirt. The double track gently climbed higher up the hill, passing secondary forest and a plantation of eucalyptus trees which exuded a refreshing scent. Less than 3.5km from the monastery, I finally spotted a short single track on the right-hand side that lead to Pha Kew. \nThe view from the top of the cliff was pleasant. Apart from the adjoining Phu Phaeng Ma, you can also see farmlands down below and the hill on the right-hand side which, of course, is Phu Mhu. \nAfter gliding downhill back to the main road which came from the dam, I followed it southward for almost 5km before veering west off onto a minor road which ran through paddy fields and rubber plantations. Soon, I reached a three-way junction where I turned right toward Phu Mhu. The road led me back up north, with Phu Mhu always on my left and later on the reservoir my right. \nAfter 4.7km, there was a T-junction. I turned left and soon found the nicely paved asphalt road up Phu Mhu. At the top of the hill, apart from scenic lookout points (the one which sees Pha Kew is the east-facing one right at the forest protection unit of Phu Sa Dok Bua National Park which Phu Mhu is a part of), there was also crumbling remains of wooden dormitories left behind by US troops that used the hill as the site for a communication station during the second Indochina War. \nFrom Phu Mhu, getting back to Highway 212 and the tambon municipality didn't take long. \nW ell, see you here again next Thursday.
