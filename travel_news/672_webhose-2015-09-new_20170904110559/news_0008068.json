The paradise island has a darker side. Picture: Supplied. \nThe area, about 800km southeast of Manila, is a popular stop for foreign tourists who sail around the nation’s many tropical islands. \nBut the Philippines’ southern region has endured decades of conflict, with Muslim rebels waging a separatist conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. \nParts of Mindanao are also home to more extreme Muslim militants, the most infamous of which are the Abu Sayyaf. They engage in frequent kidnappings of locals as well as foreigners in often successful efforts to extort ransoms. \nThe Abu Sayyaf is a ragtag group of several hundred men founded in the 1990s that has withstood US-backed military operations to extinguish it. \nIn the most recent kidnapping of foreigners, Abu Sayyaf gunmen seized a German couple in April last year while they were sailing off the far south-western island of Palawan, a popular tourist destination. \nThe couple was released six months later, with the Abu Sayyaf claiming it had received all of the 250 million pesos (AU$21 million) it demanded in ransom. \nThe Abu Sayyaf is currently holding nine hostages, including four foreigners, in the jungles of Jolo island in Mindanao’s southwest, a local military spokesman said. \nIn 2001, Abu Sayyaf militants tried to seize hostages from the Pearl Farm Beach Resort south of Oceanview during a ransom-kidnapping spree in the early 2000s in the southern Philippines. \nThey seized dozens of Filipino hostages on Basilan and 21 people, mostly European tourists, from the Malaysian resort of Sipadan in 2000, and abducted three Americans and 17 Filipinos in 2001 from the Dos Palmas resort in Palawan province southwest of Manila. \nThe Abu Sayyaf, which has about 400 gunmen, was recently declared a terrorist group by a Philippine court and is also on Washington’s lists of terror organisations. \nThe militants are still holding other hostages, including two Malaysians, a Dutch bird watcher kidnapped nearly three years ago, and a town mayor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T12:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T14:28:39.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
