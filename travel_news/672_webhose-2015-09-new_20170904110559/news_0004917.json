As winners of the Yorkshire Tea Great Cricket Tea Challenge they faced a PCA England Masters XI, led by Ashes-winning former England captain Michael Vaughan, in a T20 challenge at their picturesque ground in Leicestershire. A crowd of more than 800 helped to make it a profitable afternoon for the club, who raised £10,000 via auctions, raffles and sales of their prize-winning teas on top of their £5,000 prize from Yorkshire Tea. Batting first, the PCA Masters XI, who raise money for the Professional Cricketers’ Association Benevolent Fund, made a flying start through openers Darren Maddy and Usman Afzaal, before Vaughan came to the crease and made an elegant half-century. Afzaal reached his fifty in more pugnacious fashion and Mark Ramprakash showed glimpses of his undoubted class before he was caught at square leg by Dan Brown, the Newtown Linford captain, off the bowling of David Woods. By the time Adam Hollioake had bullied his way to an unbeaten 38, the past masters of English cricket had reached an imposing 206 for four from their allotted 20 overs. As with England during the 2005 Ashes, Vaughan had four high-class pace bowlers at his disposal in Simon Jones and Matthew Hoggard, two heroes of that famous series, plus Alex Tudor and Dean Headley. Everybody who plays cricket has to start somewhere and we might have seen the next Andrew Flintoff or Joe Root None of the quartet held back, but Dean Scaysbrook, who has scored 2,000 runs in the past two seasons, showed why he is one of the feared batsmen in the Leicestershire & Rutland Cricket League with an aggressive innings of 65. But although the home side battled gamely, Woods making 28 and Brown an unbeaten 25, they were defeated by 62 runs. “Today was just about right,” Vaughan said. “They played it in the right way. There were 800 people here and I can’t imagine they’ve had a crowd like that before. There were probably people who have never been down to the club but hopefully will come back in future.” Hoggard, Tudor and Paul Nixon, the former England wicketkeeper, had turned up in the morning to deliver a coaching masterclass to the thriving junior section at the club. “It was really fantastic,” Hoggard said. “Everybody who plays cricket has to start somewhere and we might have seen the next Andrew Flintoff or Joe Root. Look at all the people at the ground as well.” Nixon added: “I’ve played here before in a couple of benefit games. The passion is wonderful. They want to make a difference for the next generation.” Among the highlights was an over in which Mike Gatting, one of the Yorkshire Tea Great Cricket Tea Challenge judges, faced Jones, who is still bowling 85mph, and was bowled twice and struck in the box, but drew an enormous cheer when he hit the last ball he faced for four. The Sporting Auction raised £2,400, Yorkshire Tea served brews from their tea van, Little Urn and Jon Dale, the Newtown Linford chairman, summed up the day perfectly. “It will live long in everyone’s memory.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T19:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T14:28:22.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
