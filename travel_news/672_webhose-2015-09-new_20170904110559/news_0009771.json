The Group is also involved in airport management, with 17 airports managed by SNC-Lavalin, 16 of them in France .\nThe Grand Paris Line 18 is one of many large scale public transit projects SNC-Lavalin has worked on abroad and in Canada , including the Gold Coast Rapid Transit Line in Australia , the new metro line in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia , the Canada Line in Vancouver , and the Confederation Line in Ottawa .\nAbout SNC-Lavalin\nFounded in 1911, SNC-Lavalin is one of the leading engineering and construction groups in the world and a major player in the ownership of infrastructure.
