Share this article Share With the plane about nine tonnes above the normal landing weight, it was forced to circle for about 40 minutes to burn off fuel, although the crew did not declare an emergency.\nAs the plane made its descent cabin crew and passengers heard a number of bangs and felt a brief period of shuddering.\nTwo passengers reported seeing a 'white object' detach from the aircraft on the right side as the slide slipped out of its carrier, hit a cabin window and fell to the ground from 3,000ft, the report stated.\nAs the plane made its descent those on board heard a number of bangs and felt a brief period of shuddering\nThe report found that a crank handle on the Boeing 757 may have moved to a release position (file photo)\nIt was found in a tree at a churchyard in Langton Green, Kent, about 20 miles east of Gatwick.\nAs the plane made its final approach the autopilot seemed to be ‘struggling’ to stay level, forcing the 50-year-old captain to disengage the autopilot and take control of the aircraft.\nThe plane ‘experienced some uncommanded roll’ but landed safely at Gatwick, where it was shut down on a taxiway and towed to the terminal.\nThe report found that the right over-wing slide carrier deployed in flight, possibly as a result of the crank handle moving to the release position.\nIt said an undetected loose screw in the plane’s flap system may have caused vibration that allowed the crank handle to move on its own, and the crank may have been moved closer to the release position when maintenance work was carried out the night before.\nBefore the incident a service bulletin had been distributed to address some of the issues cited in the report, but no action had been taken on the aircraft involved.\nThe report made two safety recommendations related to industry standards on doors and emergency exits, and wind slide alert procedures.\nIn response to the report, a Thomas Cook Airlines spokesman said: 'We took this incident extremely seriously, supported the AAIB’s investigation throughout and accept its findings entirely.\n'The AAIB report confirms all our maintenance and inspection activities on this aircraft were correctly carried out prior to this event and the two recommendations made by the AAIB are industry wide, demonstrating the continuous improvements for all that can come from such events.\n'Immediately following the investigation we reviewed our procedures and accelerated the completion of the amendments required to be made by 2017 on our Boeing 757s.'\nRead more: assets.digital.c...", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1LTGhMH", "https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/media/55cc4555ed915d534300002a/Boeing_757-3CQ_G-JMAB_08-08.pdf"], "published": "2015-09-02T19:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:18:23.985+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
