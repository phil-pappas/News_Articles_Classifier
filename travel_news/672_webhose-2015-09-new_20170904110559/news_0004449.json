These were very small shore crabs, and to be honest I had no idea how he would end up using them in a recipe. Before we set out hunting we used to trundle to the restaurant’s back door, where the fish prep section was, and get bits of fish to hang on our little crab lines. I vividly remember sitting and fishing among several other families who were all doing the same, smug in the knowledge that none of those other children were getting £1 a kilo for their crabs. Unfortunately this complacency was always short lived as catching a kilo of shore crabs took most of the day, and rose tinted spectacles notwithstanding, £1 between two didn’t buy much more than it would do now! • Rick Stein: how to source and cook crab Growing up in and around a kitchen was great at this age. The other chefs seemed to like us running around and became like older brothers and sisters to me and my siblings. It was one of these ‘older brothers’ who enabled us to hit the big time by suggesting we use a net onion bag to catch crabs instead of a flimsy fish line. He stuffed it full of fish heads and told us to fish on the outer harbour wall, which we duly did. People trying to catch crabs in Padstow, Cornwall The results were instant - the shore crabs got stuck in the onion net and we filled a bucket in no time. Back to the restaurant we went to weigh the bucket - it was 10kg! We had literally struck gold, although, as I recall, we didn’t return to cash in again but instead took our £5 off and bought a lot of pick and mix. So if you ever find yourself perched on a harbour wall with your family, fishing for crabs and not catching a thing, invest in an onion net (or ask a restaurant - they usually have them kicking about). • Rick Stein: 'I didn't want to cook cheffy food' It was much later, when I was training as a chef in the restaurant, that I finally realised what the shore crabs were used for - they make the base for the fish and shellfish soup that has been on the Seafood menu for 40 years. They are so sweet and add such a depth of flavour, especially when they are roasted in oil first. I was also pleased to find out that we now pay the fishermen £1.20 per kilo, 12 years after my brothers and I were doing the job, so at least dad was paying us fairly.
