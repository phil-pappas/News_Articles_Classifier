In two years since the platform launched, Switzerland has become the eighth national market now available via GoEuro.co.uk, joining the UK, Germany, Spain, Luxembourg, Belgium, The Netherlands and Italy. The addition of Switzerland contributes a further four airports, 600 train stations and 60 bus stations to the GoEuro platform, bringing the total number of possible journey destinations to 34,108. With this move GoEuro becomes the first rail metasearch to have all the trains in the DACH region in one same engine with full live data. Naren Shaam, CEO of GoEuro, commented, \"we are delighted to launch in Switzerland. With SBB as our new partner, GoEuro is the perfect fit for the alpine cantons where rail is the main mode of transport. Travellers to and from Switzerland now have the ability, for the first time, to compare air, rail and bus options in just one search by using GoEuro\" In contrast to traditional online booking platforms, GoEuro.co.uk enhances the travel planning experience by helping users find the most efficient way to search online. Travellers can plan routes to and from local towns and villages, not just cities and airports, and can compare air, rail and bus options in a single search, eliminating the need to use multiple websites to plan an entire journey. Whether travelling within the Zurich-Bern-Basel Triangle or between Geneva and Lugano, GoEuro offers passengers the best possible transport options and combinations based on price, duration and convenience – all in the user’s native language and currency. SBB spokesperson added, “Most importantly of this test for SBB is that its clients get the easiest access for our train tickets.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T02:41:25.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
