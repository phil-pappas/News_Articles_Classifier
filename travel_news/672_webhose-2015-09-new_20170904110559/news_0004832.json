Last updated 15:54, September 29 2015 123RF.COM \nNervous flyers generally have nothing to worry about when it comes to plane noises. \nEven the smallest noise can make a nervous flyer jump, but what noises should you really be worried about when flying? \nThis issue was recently addressed on a Quora.com forum , and the responses given - including advice from two aviation experts - might help you enjoy a stress free flight next time you are in the air. \nFrequent flyers will know that aeroplane are generally noisy - especially in turbulent conditions - this is because flyers seem to have the assumption that everything is \"bolted down.\" \nBut as Marc Levy, a mechanical engineer who worked for Boeing explains, that couldn't be further from the truth. \n\"When you step on an airplane and look around, you see the bins, walls between the seating sections, bathrooms (lavatories) and kitchens (galleys).\" Leary writes. \n\"The logical assumption is that everything is \"bolted down\", but the reality is much more complicated. To fully understand, you have to understand how aircraft are put together and what they are designed to tolerate.\" \nMike Leary, another former Boeing employee, goes further, providing a handy checklist of all the \"normal\" noises you should expect to hear on your next flight. \nPassengers assume everything on a plane is bolted down. They are not. Image: Supplied \nWHAT'S THAT HUMMING NOISE? \nNope, its not a rogue wasps nest, it is actually the the auxiliary power unit situated at the back of the plane. Ad Feedback \n\"That baby hums along while you are boarding the plane to keep every thing up and running while the main engines are off.\" Leary writes. \n\"In addition, most airports hook the plane up to the ground units to pump air and electricity into the plane to save money.\" \n\"When the doors close, you may notice the noise changes, and the lights will flicker, as the pilot switches from airport system to aircraft system. \n\"Next you'll hear the engine's being started â€“ first \"the whine of the spin-up\" and then \"the roar\". \nREAD MORE: Is a fear of flying realistic? \nWHAT'S THAT BARKING NOISE? \nAccording to Leary, the \"barking sound\" is not a dog smuggled onto the plane, but a fuel saving device call the \"power transfer unit\" or PTU. \nThe PTU makes sure the hydraulic pressure is balanced when there is only one engine in use during push-back and taxiing. \n\"Everyone wants to save fuel so this is their option. It's noisy and a bit unnerving as it cycles on and off, on and off, on and off due to pressure fluctuations. It sounds like a dog in the hold with a high pitched bark to some. wooof-wooof-wooof -wooof.\" \nWHAT'S THAT WHIRRING NOISE? \nOnce a plane is lined up and ready to head skyward, the pilot will steer the plane to the end of the runway, where the whirring noise will begin. According to Leary this is due to the pilot flipping a switch \"to make the wings almost twice as wide as they normally are.\" Apparently you can get a great view of this if you are sitting in back of the wing. \nWHAT'S THAT BUMPY WHEELS NOISE? \nFor many nervous flyers, this is one of the worst parts of any flight. Take off. \n\"You'll hear the engines rev up as you start moving forward.\" Leary writes. \n\"You'll be able to tell if a wheel is a little out of round because the bump of the tar strips mingle with the speed of the spinning wheels as they speed up and go bump, blump, blump. \n\"When the \"slapping\" stops, you're in the air.\" \nWHAT'S THAT WHIRRING AND \"SNAP\" NOISE? \n\"Now you will hear some of those small electric motors as the wheels are pulled up into the plane and the snap of the doors closing, first one then the other. It will get noticeably quieter immediately.\" \nOnce you are in the air you will hear another \"whine\" as the pilot brings the flaps needed for takeoff back into their normal position. This move is called \"cleaning up the plane.\" \nOnce the plane is in fight, the noise should settle. Image: Supplied \nWHAT'S THAT ENGINE NOISE? \nOnce the plane is settled into gaining altitude the engines should have quieted down, Leary explains. This will then leaving you to hopefully enjoy a stress-free and calm flight. \nWHAT'S THAT BANGING NOISE? \nThat all changes again when the plane is coming into land. \n\"First the engines will change tone and you feel a slight change as the plane slows down and starts to lower the nose. After awhile, that may get even a little steeper while they are instructed where to get in line up in the air. \n\"Now the plane is going too fast so they slow it down by having some parts on top of the wing lift up a little which make a bunch of windy noise; you might hear some of those small electrical motors again.\" Leary writes. \"The pilots align the plane with the runway and start flying towards the end of the runway. As they get close, they want that big wing again so they make those flaps come out from the back of the wing and sometimes they even make a little one open on the front of the wing to make it even larger. \"Now there is a big noise as a bang and that is the landing gear doors being opened again, then bigger machine noises while the wheels are lowered into place until they lock with a click. Wind is really roaring. The pilot has to see three green lights on his panel to know all the wheels are where they belong and it is safe.\" \nThat woofing noise you think you hear is actually the wheels of the plane. Image: Supplied \nTHE DOG RETURNS \nAs the plane comes in to land, at just the right speed, the pilot slows the engines just enough to let the runway touch the wheels. The wheels \"bark like dogs as the tires go from a complete stop to spinning over a hundred miles an hour.\" \n\"Then the pilots have to make sure the plane stays on the ground and stops so they flip a switch and a bunch of panels come out of the wings to force the plane to stay down and they have special shields on the engines which allow them to push air frontwards slowing the plane even more. They are loud roars. \"Now you'll notice a almost grinding noise as he steps on the brakes just like your car. He pushes down hard to slow the plane making that squally grindy sound and you can feel the pressure of stopping. It usually pulses a little as he presses then lightens, then presses again.\" \nThen all the nervous flyers clap because they have landed safety. \nOTHER NOISES \nSilence: This suggests both the engines have failed. Although if the engine can not be restarted, planes can still glide for quite a distance. \nLoud bang/shudder: On the runway, this could indicate a blown tyre. \nEngine backfiring sound: While flying close to the ground this could signal a bird strike. \nLightning: Lightning strikes are rare and should not pose a danger to the plane. \nIn addition to the advice given, one user of the forum was quite pragmatic in their answer, writing; \n\"In the unlikely event something should happen, there is absolutely nothing you can do.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T05:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T09:37:29.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
