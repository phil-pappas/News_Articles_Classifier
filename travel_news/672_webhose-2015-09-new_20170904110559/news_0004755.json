The name Munich - in German, - is a derived form of \"little monk.\" Monks of the Benedictine Order operated a monastery and brewery at the place that later became Old Town Munich, first mentioned in 1158.\nBorn and raised in Munich in the state of Bavaria, my husband and I this year observed our 50 years in the United States. As a young couple with a 6-year-old daughter, we embarked on our America adventure in March 1965, with just a promise of a hotel job in Washington, a few suitcases with clothes and necessities, and high anticipation.\nPlan B would have been to return to Germany after about a two-year trial period. However, a second - American - daughter born the next year, a career on track, fast friendships, and neighbors welcoming us beyond expectations made us shelve Plan B.\nStaying close to our families in Munich during our 50 years in the U.S., we have gone back to visit as many times.\nMore coverage Personal Journey: Sri Lanka, mystical and yet modern Off Broadway Review: 'The Christians' When we visited Munich in the spring, the 50-year mark made me reflect on our lives there. I remember the huge celebrations in 1958, when Munich reached a population of one million. The city was affectionately dubbed the \"Millionendorf,\" perhaps best translated as \"Village of a Million.\" Even though the city has grown to about 1.5 million, I find it has retained this attribute.\nClose to the Alps (on a clear day, you can see the whole mountain chain east to west from any tall building), a gateway to Austria, Italy, Switzerland, and Eastern European countries, Munich is a much-sought-after place to visit and live.\nThough over the years I often bemoaned the invasion of international chain stores and restaurants, I now feel Munich has the best of everything. Being part of a successful regional technology triangle with emphasis on renewable energy, the city is on top of its game futuristically. However, traditions and links to history are strong and prevalent.\nMunich truly has risen from the ashes. In my early-childhood postwar memories, the city was heaps of rubble, buildings bombed and burned out, with only facades intact. A cry for razing the city and rebuilding all new and modern was vetoed by a visionary postwar lord mayor who recognized the treasures that spoke of the rich history. Over the years, buildings and structures were restored to their previous splendor.\nThe center of Munich is the Marienplatz, site of Munich's Neo-Gothic city hall. That is where, three times daily, visitors and M端nchners alike stop and watch the world-famous Glockenspiel. Marienplatz is also the center of an extensive pedestrian zone that combines old and new: modern buildings interspersed with Gothic and richly Baroque churches, theaters, monuments, and museums.\nThe Englische Garten, an easy walk from the center, is a 1.5-square-mile park providing tranquillity for those who seek it. Munich's river, the Isar, green from its source in the Tyrolean Alps, winds its way through the city and empties into the Danube River, about 50 miles to the north.\nMunich is an often-bypassed treasure. Should you visit in autumn, the world-famous Oktoberfest will be an unforgettable bonus.\nElizabeth Klare writes from Delanco, Burlington County.\nDid a travel experience move you, change you, or give you great memories?
