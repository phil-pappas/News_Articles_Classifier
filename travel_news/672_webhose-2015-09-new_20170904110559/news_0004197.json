His work has been exhibited all around the world and featured in numerous publications, including Art in America, The New York Times , Boston Globe and the Atlanta Journal Constitution . Casey Matthews – Although a native of San Antonio, Texas , Casey has considered the Southeast her home for the past two decades, living and working on Amelia Island . Her current body of work is primarily mixed media painting, a process of layered acrylic paint, medium, gesso, charcoal, glazes, washes, handmade paper, collage, tissue, spit, and oil on canvas sealed with a layer of polished wax. Kedgar Volta – Kedgar was born in Cuba and emigrated to the United States in 2008. Since then, he has been able to draw from a dual cultural perspective to create works that represent disparate lives and environments, while also serving as narratives that remind viewers of a common humanity. His multimedia art serves as both personal artifact and a reflection of mankind’s internal landscapes. Jennifer J.L. Jones – Jennifer is an American artist raised in rural Virginia and on the central east coast of Florida . She received her Bachelor of Fine Arts from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago , and explores beauty and energy in her mixed media paintings. She employs multiple layers of abstraction and combined mediums – including a refined glazing technique – to create rich, organic patinas that evoke universal emotional and physical connecting points for the observer. Hiromi Moneyhun – Japanese papercut artist Hiromi moved to Jacksonville, Fla. in 2004 from her hometown of Kyoto, Japan . She has developed a unique homegrown artistic voice that combines traditional Japanese visual art forms, like Edo Period Japanese woodblock prints, with the super-modernity now found in Japan’s biggest cities. Her three-dimensional cut paper pieces are the result of a multistep process that invites viewers in, compelling them to reach out and touch the images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:12:51.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
