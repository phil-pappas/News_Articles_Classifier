Nothing really bad happened. The Trusted Housesitter pocketed $2000.\"It was strange coming home to find things moved,\" Ed told the Guardian , “The blankets I put on the back of the couches for the cats had been removed, and I still can't find my laptop charger. And our cardboard cutout of Niall from One Direction had been moved – someone had taken him out of the living room and put him in the garage.\"So many days have passed without proof of life. I fear that the odds of the laptop charger reappearing at John and Ed's door are fearfully low.In the interest of respecting the dignity of the undignified, we shall not discuss the delicate issue of the boy band paraphernalia.[gallery2012]Numerous Airbnb horror stories have appeared in the media over the past few years: the tenant who sublet his landlord's home without permission, the place that got trashed and robbed by drug-addled monsters, and my favorite, the Airbnb \"guests\" who hosted a sex party whose theme was obese women. Are these legit concerns? Sure. I've used Airbnb both as a host and as a guest; things go wrong sometimes. Mostly, however, it's perfectly fine. Especially since I've gotten good at screening out troublesome guests. The fact that millions of interactions go off without a hitch is why Airbnb still going strong.But that doesn't mean one shouldn't be careful.Anyway, the tale of John and Ed naturally prompts the question: what can I, as a person who leaves my home from time to time, do to prevent something similar, or worse, from happening to me?\nURLs aside, the most trusted housesitter is someone you know, not someone you hire. Ask a relative or friend to water the plants, feed the cat and bring in the mail while you're gone. Better yet, don't have anyone come by. If your cat can subsist on dry food, Minou can make it as long as a week on an autofeeder and an open toilet. Have the post office hold your mail . Invest in succulents. t Be your own NSA. Be the eye in the sky — outfit your home with nanny cams from companies like VueZone . Watch what's going on — or, hopefully not going on — by using your smartphone or tablet. Tom Cruise's parents in \" Risky Business \" would have found these devices enlightening. t Home motion detectors are remarkably affordable. There's even a free app, called People Power , that lets you turn an old iPad or iPhone into a surveillance camera and motion detector. t Change your locks. Have you ever thought about how many people have keys to your home? Probably not, because it's kind of frightening. Maybe a neighbor, who you may still be close to, maybe not. Perhaps you had a houseguest — are you sure you got the key back? Then there's the bigger universe of people who could have your key: real estate brokers, workmen who could have copied the key you left under your mat. Changing your locks isn't that cheap, but it's probably the smartest home-protection move you can make. Even better, install the lock of the future: a QR code door lock . Anyone with the QR code can get in, and it's instantly changeable. You can even send a one-time entry code to a friend who's only authorized to be there for a fixed set of days. t If you can't beat them, join them. Absentee burners John and Ed could have come home to both their computer charger and $2000 had they listed their place on Airbnb themselves.
