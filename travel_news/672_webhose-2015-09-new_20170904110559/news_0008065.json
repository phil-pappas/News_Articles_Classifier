We say, try something that fs different and unique in Hawaii. Spend a day or two on the most popular beach. Waimanalo. The beach is three miles long and full of white sand with hundreds of towering ironwood trees and boundless turquoise seas.\nTHINGS TO DO: \nTrail to Makapu fu Point Lighthouse, a gradual climb to see a magnificent lighthouse. The entire hike is along a paved path with great views. The lighthouse is not open to public, but you can get close and take some amazing pictures with Waimanalo fs beaches far below. If you're visiting between November and May, you maybe lucky enough to see humpback whales migrating between Oahu and Moloka fi and Lana fi. Surfing is a very popular sport at the beach.\nWhen in Oahu, visit the Polynesian Cultural Center for activities, shows and presentations about Hawaiian culture\nWOW FACTOR \nVisit the cultural and historical centers in Oahu, such as the Bishop Museum and Iolani Palace, it is well worth your time.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T02:50:43.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
