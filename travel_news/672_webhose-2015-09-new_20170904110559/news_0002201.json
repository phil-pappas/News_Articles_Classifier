Volunteers from the nearby city of Khoms have been guarding the site, armed with Kalashnikovs, determined to protect their heritage. We must pray that they succeed. For this monument, founded by Phoenician traders in the first millennium BC and developed by the Romans, notably under General Septimius Severus (193-211AD), is a true wonder to behold. Most of the remains are from the Roman period although, in the excellent museum on the site, there are collections of Greek pottery from the Phoenician period from about the seventh century BC. I visited in 2007; will I ever see it again? \nBarbara Varney, from Kent, wins a voucher with DialAFlight \nThe Foreign Office currently advises against all travel to Libya. Check their latest advice here: gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/libya More feedback from readers Herculaneum \nI visited Herculaneum on a coach tour in June this year and was very impressed with this lesser visited Roman city. Herculaneum is situated in the shadow of Mount Vesuvius and was destroyed in 79AD. It is a Unesco World Heritage Site and, unlike at Pompeii, the deep pyroclastic material which covered it preserved wooden and other organic-based objects such as roofs, beds, doors, food and even some 300 skeletons. It was a wealthier town than Pompeii, with many fine houses with coloured marble cladding. \nMargaret Akel, Yorkshire \nThe ancient city of Herculaneum in Campania, Italy Photo: Alamy Angkor Wat \nWe arrived at 5am to view the sunrise at the Angkor Wat temple complex. It was every bit as beautiful as promised. With the extreme heat and humidity, arriving early was a definite advantage. \nWe hired a guide, and he provided excellent insight into the history of the temple; it was pretty much south-east Asian history at my fingertips. The moment I stepped into the complex’s vicinity, I was transported to a different world, and caught a glimpse of an ancient civilisation that influenced most south-east Asian nations. \nIt was a surreal experience: the architecture, artistry and culture within Angkor Wat’s walls were just mind-blowing. \nDavid Fendick, Devon \nThe Bayon Temple of the Angor Wat temple complex in Cambodia Photo: Alamy \nVast, romantic and awe inspiring, the temples at Angkor Wat in Cambodia are best approached through the villages, slowly, by cycle or on foot. A constant battle rages between the city and the forest, competing as they have done for more than a thousand years over the temple sites. \nGiant, octopus-rooted fig trees gently crush the ancient stone walls, enhancing and destroying in slow motion. Enormous sandstone blocks litter the landscape, often beautifully and delicately carved. Monuments totter, split and crack but are renewed in a constant cycle. Huge Buddhas and Hindu gods watch from lofty towers. \nThis is a giant’s playground of guardian elephants, water buffalo and lions. Yet delicate, amazingly worked carvings emerge unexpectedly, of dancers and weird gods. It is a faded yet brilliant empire, an enormous series of crumbling masterpieces, stunning and utterly fabulous. \nAlisdair Orr, Rutland United States \nIn a wild, remote and somewhat forgotten part of the south-west United States we visited Hovenweep National Monument, which contains six separate prehistoric ruined villages dating from the Pueblo period of the mid-13th century. Straddling south-west Colorado and south-east Utah, it is a magical and desolate place which has evidence of hunter-gatherers from about 8000BC until about 200AD when early Pueblo cultures settled there and remained until about 1300. \nThe scenery is stunning with deep canyons and beautiful ruins: rim rock houses, stronghold houses, towers and a castle. The main area is the Square Tower Unit, which is based around Little Ruin Canyon where there is a campground and an excellent visitor centre which offers guided tours of nearby ruins. \nIt is one of the 20 least visited national monuments in the western US and the International Dark-Sky Association designated Hovenweep an International Dark Sky Park. \nAnthea Holloway, by email \n• America's 20 best national parks Peru \nThe air was thin and my lungs burned as they grasped for what little oxygen was available. After six months of living on a beach, riding a mountain bike uphill at 3,500m (nearly 11,500ft) was taking its toll. Maras is a small agricultural area in the Sacred Valley of Cusco, originally the beating heart of ancient Inca culture in Peru. The landscape is peppered with Inca ruins, but among the most mysterious and intriguing are the agricultural terraces of the Moray Archaeological Park. As we rode over the ridge, we could see a series of perfect concentric and elliptical rings, carved into the walls of a natural depression in the landscape. The structure is as mysterious in its purpose as it is ingenious in its engineering, with theories ranging from an ancient crop research station to a giant fertility temple. We will never know for sure, but that is what makes them so fascinating. \nThe Twin Tower ruins at Hovenweep National Monument in Colorado Photo: Alamy \nJonathan Howe, Gloucestershire \nOh, that famous Machu Picchu . You’ve seen the photos: always from the same angle, always just as beautiful. This year, after a tough 4am climb, I finally made it on to the world-renowned site. Sitting with group and guide, we admired the view. I expected to be impressed, but seeing this wonder within such a vast valley is truly mind-blowing. So mind-blowing in fact that I forgot about “rule numero uno”: no eating on site. Tired, cold and hungry, I fetched a banana from my bag. Day-dreaming and thinking to myself “How good are bananas!?”, I felt a huge fur-ball slide past my ear; I yelped as I realised that a llama had just eaten my banana! He stole it from my cold, damp hands and ate every single bit of it in just a few seconds! To think, I would have made it last at least five minutes… \nDaisy Bidault, London \nMachu Picchu, Peru Photo: Alamy \nI was on my hands and knees scrambling up the dune, my nose only a few feet away from the heels of the person in front of me when a small clay pot emerged from the sand. I shouted “Stop!” and quickly retrieved it before it was reburied. My hands trembled with excitement; I was probably the first human to have touched the pot in almost 2,000 years. It was crudely made and the rounded base was charred black. We had stumbled upon a pre-Inca burial site in the coastal desert of Peru. Everyone was buzzing with excitement. Soon I started to feel uncomfortable, however – this was an ancient grave and we were tourists inadvertently trampling all over it while searching for a scenic lunch spot. So we reverently returned the pot to its rightful place in the sand and left it to rest undisturbed for another 2,000 years. \nLucinda Kerawalla, Buckinghamshire Ephesus \nIn the late 1990s I visited the ruins of the ancient city of Ephesus while on holiday in Turkey. \nPrior to entering the site we came upon a small building which was said to be where the Virgin Mary lived in later life. The inside was set out as a shrine to her existence while outside there was a tree draped in numerous pieces of material each representing a wish made by a pilgrim. \nThe ruins of Ephesus were impressive and led me to imagine what the site might have looked like in its heyday. That day turned out to be full of very pleasant, thought-evoking and spiritual experiences which still live on in my mind and intrigue me to this day. \nTom Morrison, Lancashire \n• Turkey holiday booking guide \nThe Library of Celsus in Ephesus, Turkey Photo: Alamy \nEach week we offer a prize to whoever sends us the best travel tip.
