Credit: Danny Lawson/PA Wire/Press Association Images ScotRail says it has put on extra carriages and buses to deal with the demand for services on the new Borders Railway.\nThe company says delays have been caused by a range of factors, including a train failure, signal problems and heavy passenger loadings:\nIt's been a momentous week for the Borders, with trains returning to the area for the first time in almost 50 years.\nThousands of people have flocked to use the new line and - despite extra carriages being added to many trains - it has been particularly busy on board some services, as expected.\nAt times this has caused delays while these unusually large numbers of customers board and alight. We are aware of the ticket machine issues and are getting these fixed as soon as possible.\"\nâ€“ ScotRail spokesperson Last updated Mon 14 Sep 2015 Read more 2 updates Teething problems for Borders Railway Travel Scottish Borders Borders Railway", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T23:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T05:03:39.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
