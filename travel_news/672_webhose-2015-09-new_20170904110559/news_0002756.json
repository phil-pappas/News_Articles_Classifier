Showing growth of 53% in 3 years, with revenue of $7.4 M in 2014, Powertrain Products is now a leading supplier of refurbished automotive parts in the U.S.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150921/268697LOGO\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150921/268696\nhttp://www.powertrainproducts.net - is an online source for re-engineered automotive engines, cylinder heads, transmissions, differentials and transfer cases. With a motto of, \"Not Just Rebuilt, Re-engineered\", Powertrain Products has propelled to the top of the drivetrain suppliers in the industry.\nRather than buying new vehicles altogether, many car & truck owners prefer to simply replace failing drivelines with rebuilt components. This has proven especially true in Dodge 3.7, 4.7 and 5.7 lines, as well as the Ford 5.4 3 valve engine found in the 2004-2010 F-series trucks. \"We spend countless hours correcting factory faults and poor engineering,\" says Eddie Symonds , President and founder of Powertrain Products. \"This creates not only a more reliable product, but in many cases a product that operates better than it did new.\"\nIn 2010 Powertrain Products launched the industry's first NO FAULT warranty, which for a fee, provides coverage on all products, regardless of failure. This protection-plan protects consumers from negligent handling or installation by a mechanic that would otherwise leave them with no-where else to turn in the event of this kind of mistake.\n\"We've invested heavily in our process and warranty services, to help provide the best service and support to our customers that we can,\" says Symonds. \"This allows us to provide a product that the consumer can always have peace of mind operating.\"\nAbout Powertrain Products, Inc\nPowertrain Products, Inc was founded in 2007. It is a leading domestic supplier of remanufactured engines, used engines, surplus engines, automatic transmission, manual transmissions, transfer cases, cylinder heads and differentials. They ship from 10 locations nationwide - with an inventory of over 5000 products to help ensure customers can get what they need, when they need it.\nContact:\nPowertrain Products, Inc\nEddie Symonds\nToll Free: 888-842-0023\nEmail\nWebsite: http://www.powertrainproducts.net\n releases/powertrain-products-inc-ranks-in-the-inc-5000-list-for-2015-300146751.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150921/268697LOGO", "http://www.inc.com/profile/powertrain-products", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.powertrainproducts.net/", "http://pressreleaseheadlines.com/contact?pid=290588", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150921/268696", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/powertrain-products-inc-ranks-in-the-inc-5000-list-for-2015-300146751.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH07127&Transmission_Id=201509220835PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH07127&DateId=20150922"], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T16:55:34.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
