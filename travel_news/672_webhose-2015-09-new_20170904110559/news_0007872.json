For some, this means getting the steadiest income they can or, for others, it might be a question of preserving and growing their pot to give them the maximum financial planning options as they age. Here’s a selection of funds to meet various needs that have been recently tipped by leading finance professionals in the pages of The Telegraph. Each of these will only perform one role within your investment portfolio - none will meet all your needs on their own and an effective drawdown portfolio will blend styles and assets.

The fund is UK focused and has significant holdings in large pharmaceutical and tobacco companies, with 10pc in smaller British businesses, which may grow more quickly than blue-chip firms. Mr Woodford launched his new fund only in June last year but it has quickly become the most popular fund with the majority of investment shops. So far it has returned 18pc, whereas the average fund in the sector has produced zero growth over the same period. The fund yields 2.9pc and has an ongoing cost of 0.75pc a year. The variant or “share class” to buy is “C”. For income from around the world… Artemis Global Income Artemis Global Income , which yields 3.6pc, is described as a “consistent performer”. While the fund can buy shares listed on any global stock exchange, European stocks currently account for around a third of its money. Over five years it is the number one global income fund, returning 88pc versus a sector average of 47pc. It is also top over three years, returning 58pc against a 27pc average. The fund has a total cost of 0.84pc a year. The share class to choose is “I”. For income but a chance of rapid growth… Acorn Income For those fortunate enough to have sizeable savings outside their pension, it can pay to leave their pension untouched for estate planning purposes. Pension money bequeathed by those who die before 75 is tax-free, while above that age beneficiaries will have to pay tax on withdrawals at their highest (or “marginal”) rate. In either case no inheritance tax is payable. Money outside a pension does not enjoy this protection so it makes sense to live from non-pension savings, such as Isas, if you can. If income from a pension is less vital to you Acorn Income , a small investment trust, is a racier choice that has delivered spectacular performance over various periods. Over the past five years, for example, it has returned 191pc, against 91pc for its average rival. The fund invests 70pc of its money in smaller British businesses, with the remainder in bonds. Additionally, it boasts a current yield of 3.4pc. The fund has a total cost of 0.7pc a year. Investment trusts do not have share classes. For protection in choppy markets… RIT Capital Partners Another investment trust, RIT Capital Partners , was set up to manage some of the wealth of the Rothschild family and is regarded as one of the best funds for wealth preservation. It is a global portfolio of shares, bonds, currencies, real assets and private equity investments. By spreading its bets across various assets, the fund has the potential to perform well in various conditions, smoothing out returns. The fund has a total cost of 1.25pc a year. It has returned 49pc over five years, below the 58pc achieved by the average global fund.
