It's the gift that keeps on giving. \nWhenever I mentioned I was from New Zealand, Peruvians, Chileans and Brazilians gushed effusively about our \"beautiful country\", instantly referencing The Hobbit . Cinematic scenery is New Zealand's greatest calling card. \nUnderscoring tourism's buoyancy, Air New Zealand hoisted a record annual profit last week , as the national carrier gears up to spread its wings dramatically. In December, direct services commence to Buenos Aires (Argentina) and Houston (United States). \nThe airline's unwavering strategy to hub all long-haul services out of Auckland doesn't wash well with strident parochial sentiments in Christchurch but it's a business model that underpins the carrier's world-leading performance. \nI was chatting to a charming couple from Texas who are ecstatic about non-stop services to New Zealand from the Lone Star State. They're planning to trip down here next year, after having their last holiday abruptly curtailed by the February 2011 quake. \nThey were in Akaroa when the earth convulsed – and evacuated by the US embassy. \nAs we discussed Canterbury's visitor offerings, we agreed the diversity of our region's signature visitor draws is truly world-class, notwithstanding the slow but steady reassemblage of Christchurch. Ad Feedback \nFrom the healing haven of Hanmer and unplugged wildlife encounters of Kaikoura to the dark sky delights of Mackenzie and French flair of Akaroa, it's an enviable visitor proposition, all accessible within a three hour radius of the gateway city. \nFriday's launch of the Canterbury Economic Development Strategy highlights how pivotal tourism is to the region's long-term, post-rebuild economic prosperity. \nAt the helm, Dame Margaret Bazley – the public sector's sharpest Swiss army knife. It's pleasing to see the development and implemention of a cohesive regional visitor strategy will be led by Kaikoura Mayor Winston Gray, illustrating how lucrative the satellite districts are to Canterbuy's tourism crown. \nChoreographed to chime in with the launch, Christchurch Airport confirmed that China Southern, the world's third largest airline, will operate a year-round, long-haul service between Christchurch and Guangzhou, from December. It's a major coup for the airport, seemingly clinched by the Lianne Dalziel-led delegation to China earlier this year. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T07:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T06:16:18.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
