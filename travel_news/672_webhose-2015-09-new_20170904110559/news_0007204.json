As an example, the region has a large number of places important to Buddhism. Tourists who visit Bodh Gaya can cover the entire eastern and North Eastern states where there are Buddhist temples and relics. Tourists particularly those from China, Japan, Thailand, Indonesia and Myanmar will be delighted to visit these places”, Sudesh Poddar, president, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) said in a release.\nThe FHRAI, the apex body of four regional associations representing the hospitality sector, is hosting its 50th convention in Bhubaneswar from September 25-27. The convention is likely to be attended by over 1,000 delegates.\n“It is a great opportunity for Odisha to showcase its unlimited tourism potential in view of its diverse tourism assets. Those attending the convention will have the opportunity to experience the hospitality of the people of Odisha”, he said.\nDespite the huge potential, the eastern and North-East region have been losing out on tourism due to infrastructure bottlenecks and high taxation rates.\nBesides the regional growth perspective, the three-day convention will be significant nationally as it will discuss, debate and deliberate upon the major issues concerning the industry in terms of policies, multiple taxation and possible impact of GST (Goods & Service Tax) on the industry, inordinate delay in approvals and licensing conditions.\n“To encourage entrepreneurs to set up luxury properties in this region, the government should exempt the units from all taxes for first five years. Fiscal benefits coupled with infrastructure development are keys to growth of tourism in the region”, said Poddar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T09:16:12.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
