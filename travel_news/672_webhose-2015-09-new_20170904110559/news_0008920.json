Oil prices are tumbling, airline profits are soaring, but the \"charade\" of fuel surcharges continues The cost of aviation fuel has halved in the past 12 months, and is now at a six-year low Photo: GETTY Comments \nAre we finally starting to see the benefits of lower oil prices filtering through to cheaper air fares? Or is it the airlines that are reaping the benefits? It can be a hard thing to judge. Fares are so fluid, and vary for all sorts of reasons, from a one-off spike in demand to a slump in demand because of a natural disaster or a terrorist attack. So I spoke to Trailfinders, which probably has a better anecdotal feel for the way fares have moved over the past year or two than anyone else. It seems as though travellers are now getting slightly better value, though it’s a variable picture. \n• 14 ways you're being ripped off at the airport \nThis view is backed up by Skyscanner.net, the fare-comparison website. Its data, based on many millions of fares, suggests that average return fares from the UK to European destinations have fallen 16 per cent from 2013 to 2015 (from £204.43 to £171.96). And there have been falls of five per cent in fares to Asia and Africa, and four per cent in those to Australia/Oceania. On the other hand, it appears that there have been slight rises in fares to North America and the Caribbean. The latter is particularly disappointing because Air Passenger Duty to the Caribbean was reduced by £14 last April . \nBut surely these relatively modest falls don’t reflect the huge drop in the oil price? The cost of aviation fuel has halved in the past 12 months, and is now at a six-year low. Airlines argue that this raw price doesn’t reflect what they actually have to pay: they hedge their fuel buying to protect themselves from sudden price surges. But hedging costs are also determined by the current price of fuel, so after a year or more of much lower rates, they will have fallen sharply too. \n• Holiday complaints: what to do when travel goes wrong \nThe biggest mystery for consumers remains the way the airlines apply fuel surcharges to their fares. Airlines have to quote “all-inclusive” fares, but many include a surcharge in the breakdown of other taxes and charges that make up the total fare. This week, an international lobby group, the United Federation of Travel Agents’ Associations, wrote an open letter to IATA (which represents the airlines) asking why so many airlines continue to include fuel surcharges in their fares, at a time when the cost of fuel has plunged. “How long will this charade be tolerated by the consumers?” it asked. \nAt the end of July, Ryanair?s profit for the first three months of 2015 rose 24 per cent Photo: GETTY \nStrong stuff. But I fear it is unlikely to have much effect because surcharges are used in different ways by different airlines in different countries. According to Trailfinders, airlines have generally been reducing their fuel surcharges over the past year. However, the reductions vary wildly. BA, which decides its own level of surcharge, imposes none at all on short-haul flights, and has lowered its long-haul rate by approximately £20 over the past year. But Hong-Kong based Cathay Pacific has its surcharge assessed independently by the Hong Kong government on a monthly basis. Trailfinders points out that Cathay Pacific is currently offering the best-value fares from the UK to Australia, with returns to Perth starting at £555, including all taxes and fuel surcharges. \nOver the same period, IAG, which owns BA, saw a 25 per cent rise Photo: GETTY \nUltimately, of course, whether or not they set their own surcharges, rival airlines will have to respond to market competition. But one thing is clear: while cheap fuel may have set fares on a gentle downward curve, airline profits have soared since last year. At the end of July, Ryanair’s profit for the first three months of 2015 rose 24 per cent. Over the same period, IAG, which owns BA, saw a 25 per cent rise. It is time passengers saw more of the benefits. \nNick Trend is Telegraph Travel’s consumer expert", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T11:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T11:20:43.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
