There's no concierge. There's no bellboy, no room service, no mini-bar, no restaurant, no day spa, and no breakfast buffet. Sometimes, there isn't even a room. Welcome to your holiday accommodation, circa 2015. It's not a hotel as you know it. In fact it's often not a hotel at all. \nThanks to a revolution that's been quietly taking place for the last five or six years, there's never been more choice for travellers when it comes to finding a place to lay your head. Maybe you're in someone's apartment. Maybe you're in a house. Maybe you're in a castle or a chateau or a mansion. One thing is certain: the traditional idea of what constitutes \"normal\" accommodation is gone. \nConventional hotels and resorts do still abound; in fact they're thriving. But those familiar options have now been augmented with a raft of new possibilities, led by the rapid growth of the short-term rental website Airbnb. \nThe site allows everyday home owners to rent out a room or their whole dwelling to travellers, opening up parts of cities and countries that visitors have never previously had access to. It's a revolution, but it's not without its problems. So is this the greatest thing to happen to travel since the invention of the aeroplane? Or is Airbnb just a very naughty boy? \nA one square metre house in Prenzlauer Berg Berlin, Berlin. Image: AirBnB \nCLEARING THE AIR \nOne bad experience: that's all I've had. And it wasn't even that terrible. I'd booked a place in Gothenburg, Sweden, sharing a flat for a few nights with a guy called Alex. In fairness, Alex sounded a bit odd from the outset. He was a musician who spruiked the fact that guests using his spare bed would also have access to his \"adventure room\", as well as all his recording equipment. \nThe problem was that when I arrived, Alex wasn't there. He was home in the US. And his flat hadn't been cleaned since the last guest had stayed. And it turned out that his spare bed was a mattress on the floor, and the \"adventure room\", frighteningly, was Alex's bedroom. It wasn't a pleasant stay. \nBut still, that's not bad going. I've been using Airbnb regularly for the last five years and that's the only time it's gone even slightly wrong. The rest of the time it's been a dream. I've rented properties in 10 countries across four continents. I've stayed in everything from penthouse apartments to beachfront shacks, converted warehouses to shoebox flats. And it's all been fantastic. \nEach of these experiences has demonstrated the advantage of forgoing traditional accommodation. Each time I've been given an insight into how people really live in the city I'm visiting. Each time I've been given the opportunity to stay in a neighbourhood I either couldn't normally afford, or would never be able to stay in because hotels there simply don't exist. Ad Feedback \nThis is what Airbnb and its ilk are supposed to be about. This is the dream. And I'm certainly not the only one living it. There are more than 1.2 million properties listed worldwide, with 6000 in NZ; the site has hosted more than 50 million guests. Clearly, a revolution is underway. \nANY RESERVATIONS? \nAs with most revolutions, this one has its opponents. The Airbnb model of normal residents renting out their homes is one that has upset some in the hotel industry, in government, and even users of the system. Let's address the problems. \nThe first is safety. When you rent someone's home through Airbnb, the property won't have undergone all of the fire and safety checks that a hotel room would have had to pass. Your host isn't officially regulated either, and there's been at least one recent incident of a host mistreating someone staying in their home. \nStay in Dairsie Castle in Scotland. Image: AirBNB \nSam McDonagh, general manager of Airbnb Australia, says his company is attempting to combat this with various methods of identity checking, as well as having guests review hosts, and vice versa. \"Among [these measures] are extensive [member] reviews that can only be left when a transaction has been made, member profiles with detailed information, verified phone numbers and email addresses, linkages to [members'] social media accounts, and verification of government-issued identification documents,\" he says. \nSo who else has a problem? Governments. Such a problem, in fact, that local councils are moving to force Airbnb out of some cities, banning holiday rentals of less than 30 days in New York, San Francisco and Santa Monica, among others. The issues they cite is that with so many apartments being rented to short-term visitors, the fabric of their communities is being eaten away. There's also the not-insignificant fact that the vast majority of short-term rental properties aren't paying hotel taxes, meaning governments are losing a huge amount of money. \nBut it's difficult to police. For example, despite the fact there are over 10,000 properties in Sydney listed on Airbnb, the practice of short-term rentals is supposedly banned by most Sydney councils. \"Our current planning controls do not allow tourist and visitor accommodation in residential zones or a mix of residential uses with tourist accommodation in the same building,\" says a City of Sydney spokesperson. Sounds fairly cut and dried, right? Well, it's not. \n\"Properties that are significantly overcrowded – with unauthorised building works and fire safety defects – are the city's investigative priority and the area where we'll take immediate action. We will also focus our resources on those who take advantage of vulnerable people by setting up networks of unauthorised share accommodation.\" \nSo Airbnb is not really legal. But then again, the everyday users are not being cracked down on. Even Airbnb would prefer that all of this be cleared up. \"One of the things we consistently hear from both councils and our hosts is that a lot of the policies governing home sharing are outdated and difficult to interpret,\" says McDonagh. \"Many of them were written decades ago, long before the internet even existed. That's why we've been working with governments and policy makers for clear, fair, progressive rules that allow for home sharing.\" \nYOU'RE STAYING WHERE? \nAirbnb and similar sites have changed the very nature of the travel experience. No longer are travellers locked into the hotel model, whether that's in terms of price, location, or facilities. You can now stay in a real home in an interesting neighbourhood for a fraction of the price of a hotel room. \nA modern glass treehouse in Atlanta, USA. Image: AirBnB \nYou can have access to a kitchen and a laundry without having to worry about room-service charges or getting slugged $5 to wash a pair of socks. No more boring hotel rooms, either: now you can stay in a villa, or a chateau, or a windmill, or a houseboat, or a bungalow, or a treehouse. You can live the normal life of a local in the city of your choice. For travellers, it's a complete game-changer. \nBut again, there are issues. Because who's looking after all these tourists who are suddenly arriving in formerly locals-only communities? No one. The influx of visitors into these areas does bring extra cash, but community groups in cities such as Barcelona and Paris are worried that all those tourists are changing the nature of the suburbs they come to stay in, as well as driving up the rent for those who don't want to lease their house to tourists. \nBut Airbnb is adamant. \"We're proud of the fact that the overwhelming majority of our listings are outside traditional hotel districts, so our guests live like a local, spending money at cafes, shops and restaurants not normally visited by travellers,\" says McDonagh. \"This is great news for the local economy.\" \nFair enough. And Airbnb does open up a revenue stream for property owners that didn't previously exist, often helping people stay in their homes. But those social issues remain, and they're something you have to take into account when you decide to stay in these neighbourhoods. \nREAD MORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T07:13:22.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
