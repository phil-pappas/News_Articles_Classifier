Qantas is great airline with great people and represents the very best of our wonderful country,” Jackman said.\n“Qantas has always had a vital role in promoting Australia as a tourism destination and I’m looking forward to playing my part as we work together to showcase our amazing cities, landscapes and experiences in the US., Asia and beyond.\n“What I also love about Qantas is the role it plays in the community. It’s inspiring to see an Australian company stand up for causes that make a difference and I know it’s something that the Qantas team and its employees are really passionate about.\n“The Qantas projects I will be getting involved with will create opportunities for Australians to learn, to work and to reach their potential. I will also be working directly with Qantas employees to build on the fantastic community work they already do and I can’t wait to get started later this year.”Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said the airline was thrilled to welcome Hugh Jackman in to the Qantas family as an ambassador.\nSource:-Qantas", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T03:34:37.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
