Now in its 18th year, the Glasgow Business Awards are a centrepiece of the Scottish business calendar, celebrating the accomplishments of forward thinking and innovative organisations. The Beardmore has been shortlisted for both the prestigious Glasgow Business Award for Green Champion and Award for Sustainable Development. \nThe Beardmore has an exceptional track record in providing innovative and sustainable practices, most recently receiving the Taste our Best accreditation from VisitScotland for their environmentally friendly, sustainable approach to delivering high quality, fresh food and ingredients. The Conference Centre of Excellence has also consistently received the Green Tourism Gold Award for the last four years. Commenting on the nomination, Director of the Beardmore Hotel and Conference Centre, Bronagh Bell, said: “The Glasgow Business Awards are one of the most prestigious award ceremonies in the country, and to be shortlisted in these two, extremely competitive, categories is an amazing accomplishment that our entire team is very proud of. “As part of our commitment to high quality and innovative guest services, sustainability and environmentally friendly practices are at the core of everything we do at the Beardmore. We want to ensure that the environment is safeguarded for future generations and we are continually looking for new and creative ways to improve our performance in this area.” The Conference Hotel’s Green Agenda aims to encompass staff, delegates and guests through pioneering initiatives such as their Green Conference Package, electric car charging points, video conferencing to allow for reduced travel and more. Bronagh added: “Our Green Team consists of representatives from every department in the conference hotel and going forward we will continue to work on ways to not only deliver the best possible service for our customers, but to make those small changes, reducing, reusing and recycling, which will allow us to have not just a sustainable, but positive impact on the environment.” The Glasgow Business Awards 2015 will take place on Thursday 4 October.
