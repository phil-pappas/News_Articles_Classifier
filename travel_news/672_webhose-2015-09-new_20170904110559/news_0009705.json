But when a research project sent her to Antarctica, she “fell in love with a whole different cold, a whole different kind of ice” and switched tracks completely. “I don’t want to sound New Age-y, but it was a spiritual experience,” said Ms. Aciego, who teaches glaciology at the University of Michigan. “We spend so much time talking about human significance, but when you are on a glacier and there’s a mile of ice below you and a mile of ice above you, you have no impact. It was so big and stark, but also so beautiful.” Combining her interest in chemistry, volcanoes and ice, Ms. Aciego has led expeditions to Alaska , Antarctica, Greenland , Iceland , Wyoming and the Canadian Rockies. She also started Big Chill Adventures, which introduces small groups to glaciers, icebergs, dog sledding and Arctic wildlife in weeklong photo-hiking tours. Below are edited excerpts from a conversation with Ms. Aciego. Photo Sarah Aciego. Credit Mindy Cambiar/Big Chill Adventures Q. What made you expand into tourism? A. People view these places as inaccessible and difficult. They think they won’t be able to handle the cold. It doesn’t have to be that way. The very first time you see a wave of ice across the horizon and the different shades of blue, it takes your breath away. I love for people to have that. I’m trying to break down the barriers that keep people from getting there. How physically fit do you need to be to take a trip? The tours are small. We take two four-wheel-drive trucks. So we can have different levels of activity. Some people are afraid of heights or not comfortable with walking off a real trail. We always have a place to sit and have a hot drink, so if you’re not interested in or capable of doing the activity you can still enjoy the surroundings. And, there’s always more hiking to be done if people are really physically fit. What’s the best time of year to explore Greenland and Iceland? I would not go in December or January because it’s too dark, but there are real advantages to all of the other seasons. In the spring you have the ice so you can go dog sledding and ice fishing. That only happens in the spring because in the summer the sea ice melts. In the summer it’s relatively warm — 60s and 70s — and you can get to a lot of places pretty easily. In the fall, Iceland has birch trees and Greenland has Arctic tundra. Everything turns gold and orange and then you put that next to a glacier or iceberg. In the spring and fall you have the Northern Lights. It depends on what you want to see and do. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T18:45:29.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
