Fit everything you need into one carry-on bag with these luggage packing tips for business travelers . 1. Wear Your Bulkiest Items If you need a jacket or blazer on your journey, save space in your luggage by wearing or carrying these bulkier items. Toting more than one pair of shoes? Always wear the heaviest pair on travel days. 2. Use Space-Saving Bags Separate your belongings by type into smaller plastic cases. You can squeeze or suction the air out of them to conserve space, and it's a great way to easily find your belongings as you unpack. Ziploc bags, which can also be re-used, work just as well in a pinch. 3. Make Use of Every Available Space From the oft-overlooked outer pockets to the space at the bottom of your case beside the handle tubing, there are lots of crevices in bags for tucking extra belongings. Use these smaller areas for things like socks, underwear, and other non-destructible items. Don't forget to stuff your shoes with small items (glasses, toiletries, non-liquid medicines), as well.\nIf your luggage has an expandability feature, consider using it only if doing so won't bump your luggage out of the carry-on-size category; the last thing you want to do after packing your bag this carefully is to have to check it! 4. Roll Items When Possible In general, the bottom of your suitcase should be filled with the clothing you care the least about - undershirts, socks, PJs and the lick. Roll these items as tightly as possible, particularly if you are not sorting things into space-saving bags, and create a flat surface by stuffing every corner of your suitcase. Leave the top of your bag for your dress shirts, slacks, skirts, etc., which should be folded loosely together. 5. Consolidate and Re-Package Items You may need those three medications or five beauty products, but you probably could do without all the packaging. Count out pills and keep them in a small ziploc bag. Invest in travel-size tubes and containers for toting small amounts of your favorite hair or face products.
