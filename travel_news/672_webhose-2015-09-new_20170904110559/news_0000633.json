The chief purser on the flight, a delightful woman named Gunjan, upgraded me...for all of 15 minutes. As I sank into the huge leather armchair and closed the sliding doors behind me, I allowed myself to play make-believe in the mind-boggling luxury of a private suite. \nIt was like flying in a tiny, elegant serviced apartment. I rather fancied the mini-bar and array of Bvlgari cosmetics in the vanity table that popped up from the walnut cabinet along with a mirror, not to mention the huge flat-screen television which gave me the feeling I was in my own private cinema. \nThe enclosed suites are side-by-side with a partition that can be lowered so that couples and family members can share the space in private. \nWhen it's time for sleep, the comfortable seat transforms into a bed. Image Justine Tyerman \nWhen it's time to sleep, the seat converts to a fully-flat bed made up with a soft foam mattress, feather duvet and pillows. There are PJs, a robe and slippers to change into and a mini-wardrobe for your day clothes. They've thought of everything in first class â€“ you can even sleep under the stars thanks to the tiny twinkling lights on the ceiling. \nSophisticated lighting options simulate day or night as desired and the suites have three windows each with a variety of shades to either block or filter the natural light. \nI would never get any rest in such an environment because I am obsessed with high-altitude geography and studying the topography of the planet from 40,000 ft. With three windows to choose from, not to mention the cameras on the aircraft looking forward and directly below, I would be in a constant state of over-stimulation. \nMy flight, a Boeing 777-300ER, had eight first-class suites while the A380-300 has 12, as well as two shower spas where you can freshen up while you zip through the sky at .85 mach, over 1040km an hour. I wonder which way the water goes down the plug hole and what happens if you are showering as you cross between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. \nI was concerned my presence might disturb Gunjan's passengers but she said there was only one occupant on our flight and she was fast asleep. Seven empty suites... it seemed like such a waste. \nGunjan tactfully extracted me from my suite with the offer of a visit up front where I met an handsome young pilot, one of four on the flight, one extra than usual because it was a training flight, he said. I wanted to ask him all sorts of corny questions about what it's like to have the sexiest job in the world, but he said he had some important business to attend to in the cockpit. Ad Feedback \nThe pop-up bar means travellers never need to go thirsty. Image: Justine Tyerman \nOne of the most impressive pieces of equipment on the aircraft is the Tempus IC, a remote diagnostic technologies system which connects by satellite to a team of doctors in the US. \nTempus IC enables specially-trained crew members to measure information such as the pulse rate, temperature and heart rate of a sick passenger, and transmit the data quickly to doctors at the ground-based medical response centre. \nGunjan and other senior staff are trained in the use of the equipment which is not only a life-saver but also a cost-saver for the airline as there are now fewer mid-flight medical diversions. \nShe also showed me the chief purser's iPad where she had information on all her passengers, including their likes and dislikes, status with Emirates and when their Sky Miles expire. \nREAD MORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T06:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T00:43:51.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
