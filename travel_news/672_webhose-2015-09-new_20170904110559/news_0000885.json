Located within Elizabeth Quay development will be the upcoming Ritz Carlton (2018) and nearby the DoubleTree by Hilton Perth Waterfront (2017). These hotels join the numerous hotel properties opening in Perth over the next 5 years, providing an additional 2000 rooms. In addition, Crown Perth has transformed into a fully-integrated tourism resort with two hotels and work progressing on a six-star, 500 room luxury property Crown Towers, due to open at the start of 2017.
