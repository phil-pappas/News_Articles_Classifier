The cobblestoned streets and roofs covered with snow are so romantic. Winter is my favourite time in Prague also because it is not as busy with visitors as in other seasons. Concerts, exhibitions, Christmas markets, roasted chestnuts, mulled wine and more – that’s what I imagine when thinking of perfect winter getaway in Prague,” says Petr Zezula, Chef Concierge at Four Seasons Hotel Prague and President of Les Clefs d’Or for the Czech Republic.\nFor this festive season, Four Seasons Hotel Prague has created a Prague Christmas Markets package including luxurious accommodations, a horse-drawn carriage ride around the city centre of Prague with roasted chestnuts and mulled wine prepared by the CottoCrudo kitchen team, and an afternoon coffee or tea with a selection of delicious traditional Czech Christmas cookies served in the Hotel Lobby or CottoCrudo bar.\nZezula adds: “The carriage ride ends at the Old Town Square Christmas market, where our guests are free to shop and explore Czech festive traditions. Prague Christmas markets are known as among the most beautiful in Europe, definitely a highlight of our city when visiting in December.”\nThe package is based on minimum stay of two nights with rates starting at EUR 295 and is available from November 28, 2015 until January 4, 2016.\nFour Seasons Hotel Prague has also prepared a variety of festivities including Christmas menus, live concerts in the Lobby and New Year’s Eve celebration for the season.\nSource:- Four Season Hotels & Resort", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T19:30:45.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
