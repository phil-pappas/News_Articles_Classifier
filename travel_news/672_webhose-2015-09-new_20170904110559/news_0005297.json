The event brings together the public and private sectors to address issues facing the adventure travel, responsible and sustainable tourism sectors.\n“PATA is excited to have the opportunity to showcase the historic northern city of Chiang Rai, Thailand. The city has so much to offer today’s travellers wishing to experience natural beauty, indigenous culture, and rich heritage,” said PATA CEO Mario Hardy. “The choice of the destination reflects the growing importance of dispersing tourists to emerging destinations, an issue the Association has been actively promoting through such activities as the PATA CEO Challenge 2015. This event is the perfect opportunity for travel trade professionals to learn first hand about this fast growing tourist destination.”\nSugree Sithivanich, Deputy Governor for Marketing Communications, Tourism Authority of Thailand added, “TAT has been encouraging tourism that promotes the environment and contributes to social and cultural betterment. It is in line with the “balanced philosophy” of tourism, which ensures that economic benefits of tourism go hand-in-hand with environmental and cultural preservation. That’s why Thailand is pleased to be the host of the PATA Adventure Travel and Responsible Tourism Conference and Mart 2016 .\nWe also felt that Chiang Rai will be perfect destination for the PATA Adventure Travel and Responsible Tourism Conference & Mart 2016. In addition to being a wonderful destination in its own right, it also lies at the heart of the Golden Triangle region where the Thai border meets with those of Myanmar and Lao PDR. So visitors will be able to get a three-in-one package by being able to visit all three destinations for the cost of one.”\nThe former capital of the great Lanna Kingdom, Chiang Rai is a fascinating province filled with cultural and natural wonders. Located in northern Thailand, it is a land of outstanding natural beauty, where tourists can escape the crowds and visit remote hill tribes and spot exotic wildlife.\nChiang Rai now competes with Chiang Mai as a major tourist attraction and is fast becoming a popular escape for today’s tourists. A traveller’s paradise, endowed with abundant natural attractions and antiquities, attractions range from ruins of ancient settlements and Buddhist shrines to magnificent mountain scenery and hill tribe villages. For those interested in the pristine natural beauty of the countryside, travellers can take part in jungle trekking or mountain hiking. Visitors can also take the opportunity to immerse themselves in the indigenous culture, including those of a variety of different hill tribe communities.\nSource:- PATA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T03:31:52.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
