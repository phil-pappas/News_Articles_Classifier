Flight Coordinator, Jessica Cardenas , has facilitated a fair few of those flights and offered her suggestions:\nWheelchairs -\"When traveling with a wheelchair it's important to call the airline ahead of time,\" said Cardenas. \"They will need to know if the chair is collapsible, its dimensions, if it uses wet or dry cell batteries, the number of batteries, etc. Airports will also provide patrons with a wheelchair onsite, should they need it.\" Arrival Time -Cardenas explained that those traveling with a physical disability should plan to arrive early at the gate. \"Keep in mind that you'll be one of the first to board, so budget time accordingly,\" she said. Service Animals -\"It always helps to give the airline a 'heads-up' that you have a service animal,\" Cardenas explained. \"That way the crew will know ahead of time so they can more easily accommodate you.\" Portable Oxygen -Due to safety issues, the FAA will only allow certain portable oxygen devices on an aircraft. \"This is another situation where it's best to call the airline and listen to their policy,\" Cardenas said. \"You will most likely need a note from your doctor, so keep that in mind, as well.\" For more information about Miracle Flights, to request flight assistance, or to make a donation, call (800) FLY-1711 (800-359-1711) or visit www.miracleflights.org .\nAbout Miracle Flights\nMiracle Flights for Kids is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization providing free medical air transportation via commercial airlines throughout the United States.
