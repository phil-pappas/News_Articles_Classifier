Disrupting the $27 billion self-storage industry by providing transparency, world-class service and a superior product experience, Clutter is a true global game changer. Clutter takes the \"self\" out of self-storage, offering convenient and affordable one-click access to storage akin to a valet car service. Clutter is first-to-market in catering to both large and small storage needs, from stowing away skis and holiday ornaments to entire apartments, through a variety of customized plan options. Stored belongings including seasonal favorites can then be delivered back to the customer on a whim.\nWith its fall debut in time for the holidays, New Yorkers can now experience this simple storage solution. The service is especially convenient in a city where many don't have cars as Clutter handles the heavy lifting, eliminating the need to rent a van, hire movers or even pack.\nThree years ago, an entrepreneur named Brian Thomas lost a beloved book to a disorganized self-storage space and decided to take the whole self-storage system in hand. Today, the company he founded as a result stands poised to help thousands of New Yorkers never lose anything again.\n\"In densely populated cities like New York , dealing with storage can be a real challenge,\" says Brian Thomas , the company's CEO and Founder. \"With our entry into the market, Clutter will be changing the paradigm, providing a modern and accessible alternative. We guarantee our customers an intuitive process, a full visual inventory and easy access to their belongings.\"\nAfter visiting the company's website, users coordinate their items to be stored with free pick-up and one-hour onsite packing help included in the price. Clutter's careful categorization system makes organization a breeze. Truly transformative and totally transparent, Clutter photographs and labels all of its customers' belongings, which clients can then manage online, ensuring they never forget what they've stored ever again.
