Sky Harbor is on track for a record year, with passenger traffic through July up 4.5 percent from a year ago, to 26.1 million passengers, thanks to a stronger economy and travel demand.\nJuly, the peak of summer-vacation season and the airport's second-busiest month after March, was especially strong, according to figures released Tuesday. Passenger traffic jumped 6.3 percent, to 3.91 million passengers, a monthly record.\nSouthwest Airlines, which has one of its busiest operations at the airport with 170 daily non-stop flights, reported a 12.6 percent increase in passengers, to 1.27 million. The airline boarded 142,090 more passengers in July than it did in July 2014. That is more passengers than most airlines at Sky Harbor carry in a month.\nThe combined US Airways/American Airlines, the busiest carrier at the airport, carried 2.1 million passengers, up 3 percent from 2.04 million in July 2014.\nAZCENTRAL\nAllegiant adds flights from Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport\nUS Airways' passenger counts were up 4.9 percent while American's were down 24 percent. The US Airways brand, front and center for Phoenix travelers since the airline merged with Tempe-based America West in 2005, will go away in October, nearly two years after the airlines merged to form the new American. Overnight on Oct. 16, all US Airways flights at Sky Harbor and other airports will become American Airlines flights.\nMost airlines at Sky Harbor saw year-over-year increases in traffic, albeit from a smaller base. Those with double-digit gains included Air Canada, up 33.1 percent; WestJet, up 22.4 percent; and Spirit Airlines, up 12.2 percent.\nAirlines posting year-over-year decreases in July included Mexican carrier Volaris, which saw passenger counts drop 14.1 percent, to 3,707. Volaris recently announced plans to start service between Phoenix and Hermosillo, Mexico, in November.\nAZCENTRAL\nKids Free Month in San Diego throughout October", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/afdf6286be239d44e4a8543729bfeedb8c78a87f/c=299-0-2542-1267&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Phoenix/Phoenix/2014/12/04/635532885452701957-allegiantplane.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/89362853ab3a0c1db725f35658b7e7767d954227/c=0-373-2445-1754&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/09/18/Phoenix/Phoenix/635781688654030910-Zoo151.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-22T19:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T02:22:40.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
