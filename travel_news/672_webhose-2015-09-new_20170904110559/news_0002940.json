Photo: Abigail Kingston Source: Supplied\n“I just kept looking up at the pictures and saying, ‘I hope one day I can be married and I’ll wear the dress,’ ” the executive assistant from Charlotte, NC, told The Post . “I’ve always wanted that fairytale.”\nBut when Kingston, 30, got engaged to boyfriend Jason Curtis, 32, in Grand Central Terminal last year, it seemed unlikely to come true. The last bride, Kingston’s cousin, wore it in 1991. But when the dress arrived at Kingston’s mother’s house in Bethlehem, Pa, after being stored for more than two decades in a cardboard box, it was brown, tattered and too small for the ­5-foot-10 bride-to-be.\nLeslie Kingston wed Richard T Kingston Jr August 6, 1977. Leslie is the mother of the bride, Abigail. Photo: Abigail Kingston Source: Supplied\n“I thought there was no way I would ever be able to wear the dress,” Kingston said.\nIn addition to a century’s wear and tear, each bride had altered the gown’s size and style, adding lots of lace and gradually shortening the cathedral-length train to calf length.\nKingston and her mother were determined to restore it to its Victorian glory.\n“It’s not really about the way it looks, it’s more about the generations and the family tradition that has been passed down from bride to bride and that’s what makes it so much more meaningful,” said Kingston.\nTHE 120 YEAR OLD WEDDING DRESS\nAnd so dress designer Deborah LoPresti began the painstaking 200 hours of work to recreate the original design. LoPresti spent hours sorting through fabric samples in New York City and three days hand-stitching 80 pleats into the dress’s replacement sleeves.\nKingston will don the 120-year-old masterpiece when she marries her Prince Charming at The Lake House Inn in Pennsylvania on Oct. 17.\n“It was in rags ... and when I had my final fitting, it really felt like I was Cinderella,” she said.\nThe original article and full gallery was published in the New York Post.\n Bride is 11th to wear 120-year-old dress Increase ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/bride-is-11th-to-wear-120-year-old-family-gown/story-fnixw28e-1227548758773?sv=1df25709c9409fdce175843b00c0f774", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/09/29/1227548/758261-7e5f5cae-662e-11e5-968b-5ebf3b994251.jpg", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/bride-is-11th-to-wear-120-year-old-family-gown/story-fnixw28e-1227548758773?sv=1df25709c9409fdce175843b00c0f774", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Bride+is+11th+to+wear+120-year-old+dress&c=Abigail+Kingston+is+taking+the+%26%238220%3Bsomething+borrowed%26%238221%3B+refrain+seriously+%26%238212%3B+she%26%238217%3Bll+be+the+11th+in+her+family+to+get+married+in+the+same+dress.&u=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/bride-is-11th-to-wear-120-year-old-family-gown/story-fnixw28e-1227548758773?sv=1df25709c9409fdce175843b00c0f774", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/09/29/1227548/758746-7b0212fe-662e-11e5-968b-5ebf3b994251.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/bride-is-11th-to-wear-120-year-old-family-gown/story-fnq2o7dd-1227548758773", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/bride-is-11th-to-wear-120-year-old-family-gown/story-fnixw28e-1227548758773?sv=1df25709c9409fdce175843b00c0f774&title=Bride+is+11th+to+wear+120-year-old+dress", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/bride-is-11th-to-wear-120-year-old-family-gown/story-fnixw28e-1227548758773?sv=1df25709c9409fdce175843b00c0f774&title=Bride+is+11th+to+wear+120-year-old+dress", "http://nypost.com/2015/09/27/something-borrowed-bride-is-11th-to-wear-120-year-old-family-gown/", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/bride-is-11th-to-wear-120-year-old-family-gown/story-fnixw28e-1227548758773?sv=1df25709c9409fdce175843b00c0f774&h=Bride+is+11th+to+wear+120-year-old+dress"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T05:43:21.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
