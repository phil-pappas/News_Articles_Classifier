One of the key priorities for the ASAP is to achieve full membership compliance to the already established quality assessment programme and to help build greater recognition of this fast-growing industry. The association believes that in a de-regulated market place, accreditation is essential as guests need to know their accommodation not only meets minimum expectations but also delivers those expectations safely and legally. “I am delighted to welcome Richard to the ASAP Steering Committee,” said James Foice, managing director of the ASAP. “Richard’s considerable experience in the serviced apartment sector will be a huge asset to our Committee, at a time of such rapid growth of the Association and in particular Richard’s and Oakwood Worldwide’s wholehearted commitment to the ASAP Quality Accreditation scheme both in the UK and overseas.” “I believe in the importance of an accreditation system which guarantees compliance, product quality and operational delivery that guests can expect from serviced apartment providers,” said Whittaker. “This belief is mirrored by Oakwood Worldwide where we place compliance, duty of care and overall guest experience at the centre of what we do.” The appointment follows Oakwood Worldwide®’s second quality accreditation, which was recently awarded by ASAP, for all its managed properties across London.
