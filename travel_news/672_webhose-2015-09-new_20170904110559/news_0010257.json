LugLoc said the fees are necessary as it is charged by telecom companies for every trace.", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1FA0rt8", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2015-09-29T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T21:38:01.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
