Bogan Shire Council \nA five-metre tall 'Big Bogan' has been erected in the centre of Bogan Shire town Nyngan, in central NSW. \nIt's hoped the rusted-iron bogan statue in the centre of the 2000-person town will draw tourists. \nIn true bogan style, stubbie holders and replicas of the statue will hit the local shelves soon. \nBut with the Big Stubby all the way up in the Northern Territory, the Big Bogan better hope his esky is full.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T10:15:50.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
