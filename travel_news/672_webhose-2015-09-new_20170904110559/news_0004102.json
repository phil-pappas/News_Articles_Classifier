(Andy Nelson/Seattle Times File) Before Marshawn Lynch and Shaun Alexander ruled the Seattle running game, there was Curt Warner — a menacing running back, who tore up the Kingdome turf on his way to three Pro Bowls and a then record-setting career with the Seahawks.\nWarner played in Seattle for seven seasons, eclipsing 1,000 yards rushing four times and totaling 6,844 yards rushing and 56 total touchdowns over that span. Despite tearing his ACL in 1984, Warner continued to dominate the NFL for several seasons before wrapping up his career in 1990 with the Los Angeles Rams.\nSince his playing days, Warner has been busy working in a partnership with Xfinity by Comcast, promoting the new X1 Sports app from Xfinitiy .\nCurt will be available to answer your questions on his playing days in Seattle, the upcoming Seahawks season, his partnership with Comcast and more in a live chat at 1:30 p.m. Wednesday on seattletimes.com/sports.\nSean Quinton", "external_links": ["http://comca.st/1Qlgv2A", "http://corporate.comcast.com/comcast-voices/football-extras-on-x1-just-in-time-for-kickoff#.VehpQwHClk0.twitter"], "published": "2015-09-09T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T01:52:33.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
