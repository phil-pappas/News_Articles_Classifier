Just a short skip out of Bangkok, Jomtien Beach has a new perspective from that of its nearby neighbour, Pattaya. There has been major investment in the area that provides many attractive elements. Centara’s new property will offer a full range of services that will allow for every guest to enjoy their stay. \nThe new property features 282 rooms, suites and residences in total, all designed with a fresh modern style, incorporating clean lines, light wood furnishings and splashes of vivid colours. All offer free WiFi, and comfortable living spaces of up to 60 square metres with the option of garden or ocean views. Pool Suites and Family Residences come complete with a private garden and plunge pool, while each residence can sleep up to 3 adults or 2 adults and 3 children. \nFamily-friendly facilities are a specialty of Centara and this new resort property definitely has a lot to offer, to even the littlest of guests. Children will be consumed in an environment unlike anything else, with a whimsically themed Kids’ Club, with Camp Safari for the youngest ones and a teenage-friendly E-Zone where there are engaging activities to keep kids of all ages entertained. Other facilities worth exploring are the lagoon-shaped swimming pool complete with Jacuzzis as well as a children’s water play area and water slide. \nFor adults, the ‘Cense by SPA Cenvaree’ is a perfect escape. Step into a world of tranquility and pampering with an extensive spa facility that is set over two floors and takes guests on a journey through the healing traditions of Southeast Asia. Guests can choose from a broad range of therapies, including massage, body treatment and facials that feature Thai herbs, floral extracts and aromatic oils. A fitness centre also allows for further rejuvenation for the body and mind. \nDining options include an all-day dining venue serving varied buffet-style breakfasts, and an international and Thai a la carte menu for lunch and dinner with indoor and outdoor dining options. The resort’s poolside restaurant offers an eclectic selection of quality food & drink, serving everything from fresh seafood and fish to chops and steaks, and perfect burgers with modern twists. In-room dining is available throughout the day, and the swim-up pool bar is another appealing feature for adult guests. \nCentra Maris Resort Jomtien is the ideal venue for small group meetings, incentive and team building gatherings. Adjacent to the lobby, the casually-styled banquet hall is perfect for cocktail receptions, and outdoor functions can be held under the shade of the resort’s native trees. \nThe fresh and fun new Centra Maris Resort Jomtien just is one and a half hours by road from Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport and conveniently close to some of the area’s most iconic attractions, including Koh Lan Island, Underwater World Pattaya, Pattaya Floating Market, and the religious monument, the Sanctuary of Truth. \nThe overall area of Jomtien is getting a face lift making it much more attractive to tourists with new sidewalks, building sports, recreation and water facilities, adding greenery and playgrounds as well as a new police substation. All of these improvements will guarantee additional benefits to the area and a safer experience. \nCentara Hotels & Resorts is Thailand’s leading hotel group, with 48 deluxe and first-class properties across Thailand, as well as 24 hotels and resorts in the Maldives, Vietnam, Bali, Sri Lanka, Qatar, Laos, Oman, Turkey and China.
