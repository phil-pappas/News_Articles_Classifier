It can be hard for many people to be able to afford the trip, and the ceremony is pictured as being something so casual - imagine flip flops and palm trees with a steel drum in the background - that it is barely better than running off to Vegas or visiting the courthouse. This is both a reality and also as far from the truth as possible for hundreds of couples that each year plan a wedding in Key West, Florida. Las Vegas is actually the number one spot for destination weddings in the world, but following close behind it in the number two spot is Key West. However, if you were to discount the all night marriage halls and drive through wedding chapels, Key West would easily be not just the number one island destination wedding choice but the top pick overall. Close to ten thousand people get married each year in Key West, and most of them do it in ceremonies no less elaborate than what happens back home. To make that happen requires a lot of help, no matter where it happens, but especially in a place so small, so popular and so far from home. The majority of that help can typically be found in one person, a professional wedding planner. Make no mistake about it, what may be seen as a luxury or an option elsewhere in the world is somewhere between a necessity and a requirement in Key West, Florida. In fact, some Key West restaurants and other venues will only work with wedding planners and not with individual couples, especially during the busy season of spring. This is actually for the couple's benefit. By having a wedding planner coordinating all of the activities, they can best ensure that everything happens the way a couple wants it to. Instead of relying on a constant barrage of phone calls, emails and missed messages, the wedding planner can meet directly with the florist, the entertainment, the caterer and everybody else that is going to be part of the big day. They can put together the perfect schedule and even help offer and secure alternate locations and possibilities if a first choice is unavailable. Organizing your own wedding can be a headache, trying to do so from a thousand miles away might just be impossible. Luckily for you it does not have to be. It is more than possible that you can have the springtime island wedding of your dreams in Key West, Florida. Now is the time to start making inquiries, reading reviews and interviewing potential wedding planners who can help make all of your dreams come true. \nJack Terry is a freelance writer who has not seen too many weddings in Key West but certainly crashed his fair share of bachelor (and bachelorette) parties. http://www.rooftopcafekeywest.com/   05 Sep   39  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T06:07:02.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
