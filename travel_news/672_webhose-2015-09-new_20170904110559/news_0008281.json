As the 2015 official resort partner of the AVIVA Tour of Britain cycle race, Foxhills and new specialist partner, Just Pedal, have created an active teambuilding experience to inspire collaboration with a competitive edge. \nThe Foxhills GT package includes: • A bespoke route, designed and risk-assessed specifically for a company’s event • Professional on-ride support and guidance from expert ride leaders • Support vehicle(s) and qualified mechanics throughout the event • Pre-ride light breakfast during the departure briefing, and lunch or an afternoon meal on return to Foxhills • Public liability insurance cover up to £10 million. Bespoke elements can be added including snacks and energy products, post-ride massages at Foxhills’ award-winning healthspa, an official photographer, branded cycling kit and overnight accommodation at the resort, including the bedrooms used by Sir Bradley Wiggins, Chris Froome and Team GB road cyclists during the London 2012 Olympics. The package can be adapted for groups of different sizes. The Foxhills Grand Tour package complements Foxhills’ long-term commitment to cycling. The Surrey resort hosted the Team GB Olympic cycling team in 2012 and Team Sky during the 2013 Tour of Britain, and boasts a world-class indoor cycling studio with over 30 Technogym bikes. Each Sunday the Foxhills Cycling Club rides through the Surrey Hills, and come 20 September will welcome cyclists from far and wide at their annual ‘Sportive’ and event after party. Marc Hayton, Managing Director of Foxhills Club & Resort, said: “We’re really excited to launch this new corporate experience with Just Pedal. Nothing beats the camaraderie of the peloton - it’s a real team effort and whether you’re a total beginner or an experienced rider, there’s a role to play. Foxhills continues to support the fantastic sport of cycling through our official partnership with the AVIVA Tour of Britain.” Rob Hawkins, Managing Director of Just Pedal, said: “We’re delighted to be working with the team at Foxhills to deliver first class corporate cycling events. Our years of experience have shown that combining exercise, healthy competition and road-inspired friendship can fast-track business relationships, inspire employees and secure client business. We’re looking forward to cycling from a fantastic venue and ensuring riders get the best experience possible.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-07T05:14:34.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
