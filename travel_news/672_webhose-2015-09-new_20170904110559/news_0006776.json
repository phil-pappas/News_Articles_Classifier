The coup led to angry demonstrations in the capital.\nThe State Department travel warning says \"gunfire continues to be reported in locations throughout\" the capital and \"many businesses providing essential services — including food, gasoline and cooking fuel — remain closed.\"\nThe department has authorized the voluntary departure of non-emergency personnel from the U.S. Embassy , which will operate with reduced staffing and will continue to provide emergency consular services.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T15:25:08.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
