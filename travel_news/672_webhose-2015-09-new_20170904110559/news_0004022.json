This new reality is formed by augmenting a transportation vehicle operator's physical view of the world with contextually relevant digital images and information. This insight paper takes a close look at key AR trends in the transportation industry.\nTransportation, as discussed here, refers mainly to motor vehicle transportation, though capabilities reviewed are transferable to marine, air, or even rail transport. It also explores the benefits of AR-based transportation systems and the leading concerns with regard to AR technology for transportation. However, there are several challenges for adoption, such as immature and sluggish user interfaces.\nKey Topics Covered:\n1. Introduction\n2. What is Augmented Reality?\n3. The Architecture of Augmented Reality\n4. The Benefits of Augmented Reality Transportation\n5. Key Trends in Augmented Reality - Transportation\n6. Key Concerns of the Transportation Industry\n7. The Last Word\n8.
