I recently visited this backwater paradise on my monsoon motorcycling holiday across Kerala. The stay was just for 2 days, but I was happy that those were 2 quality days. And one of the highlights was staying at a nice heritage homestay called the Tharavadu Heritage Home. Close to 150 years old, this place gives you the feeling of living in the luxurious past while you enjoy the Kumarakom of today. It is located right next to the canal system and the boat jetty, which means that you are never far away from your backwater houseboat cruise. Unlike other Kumarakom properties, which are aligned towards modern luxury, Tharavadu Heritage offers like a basic room with modern amenities in a very tastefully done up historic home. The wooden beams, the easy arm chairs, the big verandahs with wooden benches, the tiled roofs, the dining hall by the canal and so much more will appeal to you. In terms of pricing, this place will come under the budget category, but if I were to point too USPs of this place, those would be classic Kerala home and proximity to canal, boat jetty and restaurants. It is also close to a temple. The lush countryside and village atmosphere are just a short walk away. And even the beautiful Kumarakom bird sanctuary is just 4 kilometres away. If you are planning a holiday to Kumarakomâ€¦could be with your family, wife, girl friend or friends, such a heritage property located next to the water system offers great value for money. I would definitely recommend it post my recent experience. To know more or to book this place, you can look up the Tharavadu Heritage Home website . Welcome to BE ON THE ROAD Travel Blog!
