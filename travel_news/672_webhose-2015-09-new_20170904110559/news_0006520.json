The Golden Link Senior Center recently hosted a trip via Diamond Tours to Washington, D.C. On the 9-day/8-night trip from Crookston to Washington, the 100 participants visited the Rockford Art Museum in Illinois, the Arlington National Cemetery, the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History, took a tour of Mount Vernon and George Washington's home, and walked through the John Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh. Along the way, they ate at many great restaurants, stayed at some nice hotels and enjoyed the ride to the East Coast and back.
