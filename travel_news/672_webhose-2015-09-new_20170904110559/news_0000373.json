In South Africa, #BluRoutes will be launched at Radisson Blu Hotel Waterfront Cape Town and Radisson Blu Hotel Port Elizabeth hotels and will be rolled out in other Radisson Blu hotels over the next few months. \n“Our guests, whether they travel for business or leisure, typically have packed schedules with little downtime. Because of this, habits like exercise or physical fitness end up very low on their list of priorities,” said Marc Descrozaille, Area Vice President Sub-Saharan Africa, The Rezidor Hotel Group. “With #BluRoutes, we hope to change this scenario in an engaging, fun way. At the Radisson Blu we constantly try to find ways to provide holistic services that contribute to the well- being of our guests. Therefore this programme offers them a way to not only maintain their fitness during their stay, but also a chance to experience the beautiful sights of the city around them.” \nParticipating hotels will have one or more routes of varying distances and degrees of difficulty that start and end at the hotel. Guests may access #BluRoutes via the hotel’s website, or request a printed map from the hotel’s reception desk. \nWith over 280 hotels in 62 countries, Radisson Blu properties can be found in prime locations, including major cities, airport gateways and leisure destinations around the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T20:31:25.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
