For males, life expectancy at birth has increased from 51 years (in 1910-1912) to 79 years today. Women in 1910 were expected to live until they were 55, but now that figure has increased to 83. In addition, people aged 60 and older are expected to live around 9 years longer than they would have 100 years earlier. Experts say much of the increase can be attributed to improvements in infant and child mortality in the first half of the 20th century - though the ONS say \"gains in life expectancy at older ages have mainly occured in the last 50 years.\" People are living longer Photo: REX Some experts have warned that our rising life expectancy may have a detrimental affect on retirement, and that people should prepare for working until they are 100 . The Department for Work and Pensions acknowledged that life expectancy is rising and working patterns will have to adapt to reflect the change, but stopped short of suggesting retiring in our 100s. A spokesperson said: \"A retirement age of 100 is clearly not realistic. “Changing the nature of retirement, giving people more options to work flexibly, and making giving up work a process rather than an event in later life makes sense, but there are natural limits to how far this can extend for most people.” Despite a rising global life expectancy of about six years , experts say our longer lives will be marred by significant health problems. Writing in The Lancet , an online medical journal, researchers said: \"People around the world are living longer, even in some of the poorest countries, but a complex mix of fatal and nonfatal ailments causes a tremendous amount of health loss.\" We could be working into our 100s Photo: HOWARD McWILLIAM In the journal the researchers wrote that \"healthy life expectancy takes into account not just mortality but also the impact of nonfatal conditions and summarizes the years lived with disability and years lost due to premature mortality. \"The increase in healthy life expectancy has not been as dramatic as the growth of life expectancy, and as a result, people are living more years with illness and disability.\" The researchers found that countries with the highest healthy life expectancy were Japan, Singapore and Andorra whilst Lesotho, Swaziland, and the Central African Republic had the lowest healthy life expectancy. The leading causes of health loss globally were Ischemic heart disease, a lower respiratory infection, and suffering from a stroke. Currently, the Stroke Association estimate that approximately 152,000 strokes occur every year - one every 3 and a half minutes. @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T16:20:31.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
