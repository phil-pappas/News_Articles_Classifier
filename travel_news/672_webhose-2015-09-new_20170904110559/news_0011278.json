It is a NURSE stethoscope too. I use it to listen to a child’s lungs, so I can quickly get them to the appropriate level of care, reassuring both child and parent. I also use it to listen to our elderly loved ones, who sometimes have aging hearts that go into abnormal rhythms. It is the NURSE that usually sees the patient first, and it is often the NURSE that notifies the doctor of what is going on.\"\n>> Click here to see the Facebook post\nFrom the comments section, we can see that people are outraged by the statements about nursing made on “The View” and they are rallying behind Helkenn.
