Critics say the large amphibious vehicles are built for war, not for ferrying tourists. The tours here are complete with exuberant drivers who play loud music and quack through speakers. \"These are military craft that were never designed to navigate narrow city streets,\" said attorney Steve Bulzomi, who represented a motorcyclist who was run over and dragged by a duck boat that came up behind him at a stoplight in Seattle in 2011. \"This is a business model that requires the driver to be a driver, tour guide and entertainer at the same time.\"About 45 students and staff from North Seattle College were traveling Thursday to the city's iconic Pike Place Market and Safeco Field for orientation events when witnesses said the duck boat suddenly swerved into their oncoming charter bus. Brad Volm of Philadelphia was driving in another vehicle and said the amphibious vehicle's left front tire appeared to lock up. Authorities say it's too soon to determine what caused the crash that killed four students from Austria, China, Indonesia and Japan, authorities said. A National Transportation Safety Board team was to arrive Friday and lead the investigation. The president of Ride the Ducks Seattle said his main concern was the families of the victims. Brian Tracey told The Associated Press that \"we will get to the bottom\" of the crash. Tracey said 36 people were on the vehicle, whose driver had Coast Guard certification and a commercial driving license. All company drivers are required to take continuing education classes, he said. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T19:48:07.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
