Contestants in the National Ms. Senior America 2015 Pageant are women who have reached the \"Age of Elegance\"--60 years and older-- who now are vying for the national title, Ms. Senior America. This year, the ladies will be hydrated by Sponsor SNOâ„¢ glacier water from Iceland ( www.DrinkSNOwater.com ).\nFounded by Dr. Al Mott in 1972, the Ms. Senior America Pageant ( www.senioramerica.org ), is a celebration of the continuing contributions of senior women. \"The gifts of talent don't diminish with age,\" says Mott, \"and our senior women make valuable contributions that should be recognized.\" Contestants are judged on interview, evening gown, talent and philosophy of life presentations, but rally around their queen when the pageant is done and continue to work together year round. Senior America queens in gowns, crowns, banners and bling are found singing and dancing in nursing homes, hospitals and veteran's facilities.\n\"The pageant is an opportunity to become a volunteer,\" says Finals Co-host Dee Dee Sharp , better known for her string of gold records. \"The winner is an advocate for women around the world to keep doing what they love, and help others in doing so,\" Sharp adds.\n\"These women go through so much to be at this pageant that everyone there is a winner just stepping on that stage, says celebrity judge Vini Lopez , a Rock and Roll Hall of Famer as a member of the E Street Band. Lopez continues, \"All the ladies are gorgeous and have beauty beyond their limits.\"\nPageant and Showcase Tickets are available through Resorts Casino Hotel both online and at the box office.
