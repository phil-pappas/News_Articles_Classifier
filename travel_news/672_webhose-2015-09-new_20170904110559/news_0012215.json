On the basis of application areas, the rail composites market can be broadly segmented into interior, exterior, and others. The demand for composites in rail interior components is growing because of its impressive strength-to-weight ratio and appearance properties. The Europe and Asia-Pacific regions are the biggest rail composites market, accounting for more than 60% of the total rail composite demand in 2014. There is a lot of scope in the Asia-Pacific rail composites market due to high demand and increasing rail manufacturing base in the region. With the emerging technological developments and innovations, the global demand for rail composite may further augment at a higher pace.\nCurrently, the penetration of rail composite is increasing in high speed trains and this trend can be seen being extended to mid-speed trains as well. The design flexibility offered by composites is pushing the rail composites market in different rail applications. Technological developments & innovations and expansions are identified as key strategies to expand the rail composite market. This study on rail composites market estimates its global demand and market value for 2015 and projects the expected demand and market value of the same by 2020.
