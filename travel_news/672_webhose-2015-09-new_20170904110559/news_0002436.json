If successful, they will be notified prior to their arrival date; should they fail in their bid, the original reservation will be retained. \n\nUpsellGuru aims to benefit hotels by eliminating the potential number of free upgrades and moving guests out of lower category rooms, thus making space for higher occupancy. \n\nAccording to a statement by the company, early adopters of the system are seeing an increase in numbers in their upsell revenue, and their customers believe that more profit can be gained by using a bidding system as compared with the conventional way of simply offering upgrades for a fixed amount.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T12:35:45.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
