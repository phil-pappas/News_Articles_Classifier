According to the head of Oliver Kinross Asia Pacific, James McKenzie, organiser of the Asia Pacific MICE Awards 2015, the accolade recognises the Centre’s prime location as “a conference venue needs to be easily accessible and this can often be a deciding factor. \n“The Centre also met all the other criteria such as setting the right tone for a conference to ensure delegates leave with the right impression about the host and, an extra component that is becoming increasingly essential for a good conference venue – technology. With the rise of the mobile workforce and the need to stay connected while on the move, the technology requirements for events and meetings have evolved.” He added that, as the winning conference venue, the Centre has the size and capabilities to handle what different conferences require in a bespoke manner while its infrastructure also “differentiates the venue by giving delegates an experience they would not forget.” Expressing his delight at the Centre’s win, General Manager Alan Pryor dedicated the award to the Centre’s team whose continuing hard work and commitment to the delivery of quality products and services have been key to the venue’s growth and success to date. “We are truly ecstatic to have won the award and that the hard work, dedication and persistence of our entire team have been recognised and rewarded,” said Pryor. The Asia Pacific MICE Awards recognises achievements that have a defining role in delivering exceptional quality, service, innovation, and more importantly, in driving the MICE industry forward and is judged by leading event organisers, national tourism bodies, communication agencies and MICE publications from throughout Asia Pacific.
