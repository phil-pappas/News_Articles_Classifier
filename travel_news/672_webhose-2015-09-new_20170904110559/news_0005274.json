The donations will assist in rebuilding the school and providing local children with school supplies. The school is a 10-minute walk from the resort where Majestic Whale Encounters guests stay, meaning travellers may visit the school as part of their whale swim tour.\nStarting on August 23, 2016, the eight-day tour will include five days of whale swims, giving guests opportunities to swim, snorkel and spot humpback whales in their natural environment. Every year from July to October, the whales migrate to the tropical northern islands of Tonga to mate and give birth, offering swimmers more chances to get to know the gentle mammals. Guests will stay at Sandy Beach Resort Ha’apai where they can bush walk, fish, cycle or just relax during their two leisure days.\nThe tour costs from A$3941 per person, twin share, including the $150 per person discount if booked before October 15, 2015. The tour includes seven nights’ accommodation, five days on the water with skipper, guide and marine scientist, all main meals, a welcome dinner and all local flights and transfers.\nFor bookings made by October 15, 2015, Majestic Whale Encounters will donate $150 for each person to Faleloa Public School. Flights to Tonga from Australia (five hours direct) with Virgin Australia are extra.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T18:25:43.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
