It makes everyone dream. France is reputed for perfume, so our aim is to share the treasures we have accumulated,\" said Agnes Costa Webster, great-granddaughter of Fragonard founder Jean-Francois Costa, who delved into the family's vast collections to create the museum.\nShe unearthed hundreds of art objects, exotic vials, age-old distilleries and olfactory apparatus that are now presented to the public, many for the first time, alongside black-and-white archive footage.\nAside from the history, a new major museum — now among several other smaller museums in Paris dedicated to scents — demonstrates both perfume's increased popularity and its status as the financial backbone of today's globalized luxury industry.\n\"There are marvels in the contemporary perfumery creation,\" Costa Webster said. \"I think this is an art which will never end.\"\nThe museum shows the twists of fate and history that shaped the olfactory art form.\nVials and trinkets trace how perfume went out of fashion in the Middle Ages but reached a new high in the 15th century, when Frenchmen, fearful of diseases in the water, refrained from washing and relied on perfume to hide bodily odours. By the 18th century, trendsetter Marie Antoinette was dictating what scents were in vogue — she preferred floral notes — and bottles reached the height of ostentation. One scent bottle from England had delicate gold and crystal dating from 1760.\n___\nThomas Adamson can be followed at http://Twitter.com/ThomasAdamsonAP\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T16:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T02:07:34.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
