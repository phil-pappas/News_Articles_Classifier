The World Heritage-listed historic centre is one of the largest, least-altered and best-preserved cities in South America, with 130 monument buildings, including Carondelet Palace, which is the seat of Government for Ecuador, the striking Cathedral of Quito and the baroque Santo Domingo Convent. Other popular tourist attractions include a number of museums and an aerial tramway which takes passengers from the city centre to the east side of the Pichincha volcano, offering spectacular views of the city and surrounds.\nJust 25km from Quito is Ciudad Mitad del Mundo (the ‘Middle of the World’), where travellers can stand with a foot in each hemisphere. The iconic attraction also boasts a planetarium, a miniature model of Quito and a museum about the indigenous people of Ecuador.\nNew 2016 Scenic tour to showcase Ecuador – Free Flight Offer\nQuito will form the starting point for Scenic’s 22-day Peru Adventure, Galápagos and Amazon Cruising tour, with the first three nights spent in a luxury Quito hotel.

Travellers will also visit the Intiñan Solar Museum and take a walking tour of Quito’s historic old town.\nThe journey will then continue to the Galápagos Islands, where travellers will board a deluxe expedition ship and see stunning landscapes, unusual lava formations and endemic species such as marine iguanas, sea lions, the slow-moving Galápagos giant tortoise and various species of bird.
