It also is the fourth German company in this sector operating here.\nCINDE data show that free zone exports related to information technology in 2014 accounted for $2.2 billion, representing 65 percent of total service exports.\nThose interested in applying for a job can find information at Bosch’s website or by emailing: talentacquisitioncr@bosch.com\nContact L.
