Requires iOS7 or later.\n>> Cost : Free\n>> What it does : Connects road trippers/drivers with people who want to send stuff. Roadie calls it “carpooling for cargo.”\n>> What’s hot : Some budget travelers might be thrilled by the opportunity to get paid for a one-time delivery while on the road. There are both crosstown drop-offs and cross-country delivery gigs. Roadie says most local deliveries will pay drivers $8 to $20; oversize items might get you $200. If you’re sending, your cargo is insured up to $500. You can view all the gigs by map or list. To be a sender, you’ll need a PayPal account; to be a driver, you must upload your driver’s license, insurance card and banking information.\n>> What’s not : The start-up process could have been smoother. I had to restart the app a couple of times and needed superstrong Wi-Fi to sign up and upload my profile pic. The app would be even more useful if it had a “Near Me” button for drivers looking to pick up their next jobs.\n———\nJen Leo, ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T23:40:46.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
