Henri's remnants will interact with a large low pressure system and the combination will create a powerful storm that will then track toward the United Kingdom Tuesday night into Wednesday. \n\"The heaviest rain will target northern Portugal and northwest Spain,\" said AccuWeather Meteorologist Anthony Sagliani. \"While heavy rain remains a threat to the United Kingdom, the worst now appears to bypass the region to the south.\" \nHeavy rain will slam into northern Portugal and northwest Spain early Tuesday morning and continue throughout the day on Tuesday. More rain will then quickly spread into western France. \nFarther north, rain, some heavy, will spread across the United Kingdom later Tuesday and Wednesday. \nRain amounts of 3-6 inches (75-150 mm) are expected in northwest Spain and northern Portugal while 1-2 inches (25-50 mm) will fall in western France and southern England. \nThe rain across northern Portugal and northwest Spain will be too much rain too quickly and will result in flash flooding in the region. Porto, Portugal, will be included in this risk. \nFlash flooding will also threaten western France and southern England, but the threat will not be as severe or widespread. \nOutside of these areas, rainfall will be widespread across northwestern Europe, though rainfall will largely be less than an inch (25 mm). \nIn addition to the heavy rain, locally damaging winds will blast across western Europe as the remains of Henri slam into the region. \n\"Strong winds will sweep across western Europe, especially south and east of the track of the storm,\" said Sagliani. \nThe strongest wind gusts will be found from parts of the Netherlands and northwestern France to the northwest tip of Spain. \nThese areas are expected to be blasted by wind gusts as high as 70 mph (115 km/h). The most likely location for wind this strong will be right along the coast in areas such as Brest, France and Ferrol, Spain. \nAway from the immediate coasts, the threat for damaging winds will be much lower, with generally isolated wind gusts up to 60 mph (95 km/h). \nThe peak of the wind is expected to come later Tuesday into Wednesday. This is when isolated power outages are expected along with downed tree limbs. Strong wind gusts could bring travel delays on the ground and through the air.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T22:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T23:16:11.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
