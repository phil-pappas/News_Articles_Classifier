At the time of the closure, two mother bears, which are notoriously protective, were foraging with a pair of cubs in the canyon and a cyclist had just been chased by a bear, according to Denver Water.\nBut Waterton Canyon isn't the only park that has raised alarms about hikers with overeager photography habits.

But don't try to distract the animal while adjusting your Instagram filters.\nIn July, a woman was gored by a wild bison in Yellowstone National Park after stopping to take a selfie with the beast and her 6-year-old daughter - the third bison attack of the year involving tourists trying to take photos with the animals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T03:46:45.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
