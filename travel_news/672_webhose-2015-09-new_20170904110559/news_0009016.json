With about 3 weeks left to go and about 50 more BBQ spots to visit, Mike is halfway through his adventure. He is currently on pace to have visited around 100 BBQ stops across the country in just over 6 weeks! “Having spent 20 days on the road and visiting just about 50 BBQ joints, it is obvious that those who put out the best barbecue have a passion for what they do and love to share that passion with others,” said Mike Johnston, Founder of Savory Spice Shop. “So far I’ve tasted barbecue in West, Central, and East Texas, along with stops in Arkansas, Missouri, Memphis, and Alabama.\"\nSome of Mike’s recent visits have been to Archibald’s BBQ, Big Bob Gibson Bar-B-Que, Saw’s BBQ, and Dreamland BBQ in Alabama. During his stop in Memphis, Mike visited local BBQ landmarks such as Central BBQ, Payne’s Bar-B-Q, Charlie Vergos’ Rendezvous, Pollard’s Bar-B-Que, Elwood’s Shack, and A&R Bar-B-Que. His stops in Arkansas and Missouri included Whole Hog Café and City Butcher & BBQ.\n“I’m not sure if the 2nd half of Chasing BBQ can live up to what I’ve experienced in the 1st half, but I’m excited to see what these BBQ spots have in store for me!”\nMike will be stopping by Georgia, the Carolina's, Kentucky, along with a few Midwest states as well.
