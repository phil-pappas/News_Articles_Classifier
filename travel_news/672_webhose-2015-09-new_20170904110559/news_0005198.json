The serving includes a variety of delicious peppers and cheeses. Mythos-Feinkost also has a very good wine selection. John Vandiver/Stars and Stripes Published: September 3, 2015 I’ve dropped by the small antipasto place in Killesberg more times than I can count, but always for takeout. And every time I get the same thing — big cups of spicy roasted eggplant cheese paste and marinated butter beans. Mythos-Feinkost, a small Greek wine and cheese shop located at the shopping center in the Killesberg section of Stuttgart, has been serving an array of appetizing appetizers for several years. The main business is takeout, but many people also drop by for lunch. There are about five small tables where you can sit down for a delicious plate of antipasti, and that is just what I did on a recent walk through Killesberg Park. I should have done so sooner. For 9.50 euros, I had a plate loaded with little delicacies. Two can eat for 12.50 euros. It was a bit pricey, but the serving size was ample. It included octopus, a couple of spicy cheese pastes, garlicky olives, marinated butter beans and an assortment of peppers. The plate comes with a basket of crusty bread that’s perfect for mopping up all the marinades left behind. I was so stuffed I was belching garlic well into the night. If antipasti isn’t your thing, Mythos-Feinkost offers a range of panini sandwiches and an extensive wine list. The menu is limited, but sometimes that’s a plus. At Mythos-Feinkost, they do just a few things, but they do them well. So if you’re out and about at Killesberg Park, one of Stuttgart’s best green spots, be sure to give it a try. Mythos-Feinkost Location: Am Hoehenpark 4, which is near the entrance to Killesberg Park in the northern part of Stuttgart. Hours: 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturdays.
