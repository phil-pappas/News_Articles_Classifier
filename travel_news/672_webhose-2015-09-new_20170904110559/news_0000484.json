The support of your family and friends is just as important as the squad around you. Being surrounded by the wider Wales family is also massively important. Four years ago, we were on the other side of the world in New Zealand and we didn't have that comfort. It was difficult. You're away from your family for a long time and sometimes it can be lonely. After the Australia game, my last rugby game at the end of my career, seeing my kids was more of a reward than the game itself. The players are lucky because so much of this Rugby World Cup 2015 is at home. They can spend a lot of time in Cardiff. A lot of these players probably live less than an hour and a half away. I'm sure they will have seen a lot of their wives, girlfriends and children, and that will help, as Warren Gatland knows. You work hard on the training ground and it can get a bit claustrophobic when you're there day in, day out and you've only got your room-mate to see 24/7. Seeing your family during a World Cup is a reward. You've done the business, you've given it your all, you've cut your head, you've got a dead leg, you're bloodied, or have a tight calf and so on, and it's a bit of reassurance when you see your kids or your wife or girlfriend. You remember why you're doing it. You're not doing it for yourself. You're doing it for the people you love. Highs and lows It was almost 20 minutes before George got in the game on Saturday. That's not completely George's fault. England were pretty much dominant for the first 25 minutes of the game. Defensively he did really well. George didn't do anything wrong. His positioning was very good. George would say himself that he didn't get involved in the game in an attacking sense enough. However, that's how games go sometimes. As the game went on, he got more and more involved. He went to centre and got more involved in the game and looked more comfortable there. I'm sure with the injury crisis at the moment George will be an easy option if they need him in the centre. I know he will certainly do a job at centre. However, he certainly did his job on Saturday, as did all the guys. You won't hear a complaint from any of them because they all came off the field having given everything. They were up against the odds at times but have come away with a massive victory at Twickenham in the World Cup. All 23 of the lads involved will be delighted with the result. There's a lot of experience in that team now and they understand that they've won a big game, and they should get a pat on the back, but it's still a big week. Fiji are no pushovers and I think the Welsh players know that. They are playing a side who have knocked you out of the World Cup before. So they'll be very happy about Saturday night but they won't be getting too carried away. I'll save all my good-luck messages and my congratulations for when they actually get through to the last eight. As a Welsh player, there's nothing better than playing at the Millennium Stadium. Playing in Cardiff makes it our home World Cup. Their confidence will be up, but there will be little time to dwell on a great victory. It's a very short turnaround to the Fiji game and the big problem is the injuries. Hopefully they'll get some good news from some of the injured players. • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T01:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T20:49:18.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
