There is a jurisdictional issue with the application, as the Authority is a federal employer. Additionally, it should be noted that the Authority is not the employer of the members of the local and should not have been made a party to this application between Coventry and the union. We are also disappointed to see that the application materials contain many factual errors. We view this application, as it concerns the Authority, to be frivolous and completely without merit and we will respond to it accordingly.\nIn the meantime, we wish to advise our passengers that taxi service is being provided in a satisfactory manner under the terms and conditions of the Coventry contract. We also wish to reassure the drivers who are serving the airport that we welcome and appreciate the service that they are providing for our passengers. We encourage Coventry and the union to resume their discussions towards resolving this matter.\n \n \nSource:- Ottawa International Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T18:35:59.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
