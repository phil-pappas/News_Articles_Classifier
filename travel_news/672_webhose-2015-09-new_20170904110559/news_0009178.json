Sam's dad, Mark, was the coach of the team at Dewsbury Moor. Mark used to play for Dewsbury Rams. He was a massive man. He was an absolute carbon copy of Sam – a gentle giant. You looked at him and thought, \"gosh, this guy's intimidating\". But when he opened his mouth he had humour and he had a cheeky smile on his face. It was a deeply sad loss when his father passed away with motor neurone disease. The way that Sam dealt with the loss of his dad and comforted his twin brothers was really unbelievable. He really steadied the ship. He was the middle brother – Luke is the older one – but he very much acted as the father figure of the family at that point. Sam knows about care and support. He was the one who put an arm around twins George and Thomas's shoulders and brought them along and made them stronger mentally after the loss of their father. I think that's why the four brothers and their mother Julie are so close. It's a network they all cherish. I can remember how Sam almost helped to channel the behaviour of his younger brothers – to make sure they continued to have successful careers themselves. Losing your dad can affect you. Sam was obviously upset by it all, but the strength of character he showed in dealing with that and being able to nurture his younger brothers was inspirational. A cheeky chappy Early on, aged nine or 10, Sam would come into the club before and after matches. At the time I was a teenager myself, working behind the bar, and also working as a DJ. I DJ'd for all the Burgess boys' birthday parties. I DJ'd for Sam's 12th and his 16th birthday parties. Looking back, Sam was a cheeky chappy. He was always one of those boys who walked into the club and everyone loved him. He just had that cheeky look on his face. Just like his dad, in fact. When he goes out there, ‘The Heckie Beast’ will grab the game by the scruff of its neck Sam was raised in a place called Liversedge, but was born in Dewsbury. He went to Norristhorpe Junior School. John Holroyd, my best friend, is a PE teacher at the school. John has been in touch in the last few days and said there's a complete buzz throughout the lessons he's teaching over there as well. It's come to the point where a lot of the younger children are watching YouTube videos of \"Slammin' Sam\" Burgess. That's what he's renowned for. All the YouTube videos are about \"Slammin' Sam\". He said they're watching these videos of Sam before they go out for their PE lessons and then trying recreate what they've just seen. He's a role model for everyone – whether the kids at that school, or here at Heckmondwike Grammar, where I now teach PE. Heckmondwike is Sam's old secondary school . We've all been talking about the interview that led up to the Wales game, when he got asked about who Scott Williams was. It was so reminiscent of when Sam was here and I knew him outside of school. It was that comical edge, that little bit of cheek and banter he's got. It doesn't go too far but he's funny with it. Sam could have banter but he knew when and where to do it and he knew how to channel it in the right direction. He used to do the same with one of his mentors here, Mr Simon Keenleyside, who used to have regular battles playing badminton with him. Sam was very good at badminton. It turned into banter around school. \"Are we having that that badminton battle again today, Sir?\" Their matches became famous. The Heckie Beast As soon as I came back into school for the Monday morning lessons, all the pupils were talking about was Burgess and the loss against Wales in Rugby World Cup 2015 . We call him \"The Heckie Beast\". Should he have been taken off ? Did it change the game? The whole school are asking why our boy was taken off. It was even brought up in the staff room this morning. Why was he taken off? As soon as he came off the pitch there was an instant impact on the game. Was it a coincidence that Wales quickly scored the try that gave them the run from the centre? It's a massive debate at our school. Some people aren't happy about some of the columns that are going out to the papers. They say it was Sam's fault and whatnot... But, in our opinion, he had a fantastic game and made some excellent runs. He took some massive hits off the Welsh players on Saturday night. That's how much everyone cares about him here. We know him from boy to man. Our headteacher, Mr Mike Cook, asked me if I would pass on his comment about Sam: \"At Heckmondwike Grammar School, we are in the habit of trying to inspire our pupils to be the best they can be and to make a profound contribution in their life. Sam, like other former students, embodies these ideas and it's tremendous for today's school members to be able to focus on this particular example and believe that great things can be possible for them, too. \"We have collectively been following Sam's rugby career and drawing inspiration from his many successes so far. It has certainly added a new dimension to the way we watch international rugby matches.\" England now has a make or break game on Saturday. Sam's got to be a sure start for this game against the Aussies. Psychologically it's a massive hurdle for us to come up against a strong Australian side. Who better to be playing in that game than someone who is mentally strong and has overcome so many hurdles in life? Sam Burgess. He won't feel sorry for himself. He'll be putting his arms around team­mates, lifting everyone's spirits, and when he goes out there, \"The Heckie Beast\" will grab the game by the scruff of its neck.” • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T16:31:35.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
