With a growing client base, additional team members with specialized skillsets have joined TDG. \nNow serving a growing client base globally, Travel Development Group has extended their service hours to better accommodate the needs of all clients. TDG's Founder, Brad Messner, was recently asked why the extension of service hours was so critical. Mr. Messner responded, \"Our clients require immediate and accurate responses to their operational and technical needs. Delays for clients in other countries or time zones can directly impact both the efficiency of their operation as well as negatively impact their bottom line. Part of TDG's unique model is to meet our clients at their current state and situation.\" In response to the growing need for custom technology solutions, Travel Development Group has increased their team with industry and technology specialists. Nanette Heffelfinger, an industry veteran of more than 25 years, joined TDG on September 7, 2015 as a Developer, Travel Technology. Nanette brings vast experience in managing travel reservations for large corporations, supporting and developing online booking tools, building and maintaining front and mid-office automation products, as well as resolving client service concerns. When asked about starting her new role specializing in travel automation, Nanette answered, \"I'm looking forward to new opportunities and an awesome learning experience.\" Wayne Messner also recently joined the Travel Development Group as a Junior Developer. Having spent years working logistics, Wayne will be supporting a growing need for evening support hours as well as client implementations. His attention to detail and determination for unparalleled efficiency continues to improve Travel Development Group's global offering. To ensure ongoing client support and the ability to improve and enhance our client processes quickly and efficiently, TDG is hiring a Project Manager, additional Developers, and a team of interns. The Travel Development Group's staff skillset is diverse, ranging from Concur Compleat development, web service development, GDS scripting, .net development, operational and financial reporting, and much more. No request is too large or small for the group to review and provide a viable and cost-effective solution.
