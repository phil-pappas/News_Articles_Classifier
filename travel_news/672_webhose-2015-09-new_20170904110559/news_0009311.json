Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Sep 09, 2015 eTN Exclusive: Unique and original, timely, global breaking news: \nIncreased competition notwithstanding, Swissport Tanzania, has on the back of a strong overall performance of the aviation industry, just seen the company’s half-year profits soar by over 40 percent. In real terms, Swissport’s profit for the half year was just short of 7 billion Tanzania shillings, up from last year over the same period of time of just under 5 billion Tanzania shillings. \nThis rise emerges on the back of a rise by 9 percent of flights handled and an increase in cargo volumes by 3 percent for the first 6 months of 2015. \nThe company had in recent years invested heavily in new equipment but, perhaps even more important, invested in their staff training center to be able to meet the growing expectations of clients, among them aviation industry leaders like Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Swiss. \nDar es Salaam’s Julius Nyerere International Airport is looking ahead to a major capacity expansion when the new international terminal will be completed and commissioned, setting the stage for yet more airlines flying into Tanzania’s commercial capital and more flight movements through more frequencies by carriers operating in and out of Dar. \n“The upcoming elections should not be a problem for more growth in aviation. Tanzania has always stood out for mature election campaigns unlike other African countries. Tourist bookings are holding up, and I have no doubt that business traffic, too, will continue towards and after the elections. The Ebola scare which for long haunted us even from such a long distance, is now over, and visitor numbers are bound to rise more. This will also help airlines and in particular Fastjet which has just added a lot of more flights out of Dar es Salaam, will bring about robust growth for the sector,” wrote the source when passing the Swissport figures late yesterday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T06:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T15:03:27.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
