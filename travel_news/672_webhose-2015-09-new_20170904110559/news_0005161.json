Spa tourism constitutes a vital segment in the global travel and tourism marketplace. Between 2007 and 2013 the spa industry has grown 58 percent generating in excess of USD 94 billion in revenue.\nWorld Spa Awards have a mission to serve as the definitive benchmark of excellence, and to help to foster a new era of growth in spa tourism.\nThe voting methodology is simple: votes are cast by professionals working within the spa industry – senior executives, travel buyers, tour operators, agents and media – and by the public. Votes are submitted online at World Spa Awards website. The voting works on a first-past-the-post system to ensure impartiality and independence.\nWdson Brum, Director of Luceo Spa, says: “I am privileged to accept this award on behalf of Luceo Spa team at Four Seasons Hotel Lion Palace St. Petersburg. This represents how far Russia has come forward in the spa world, as well as the hard work of the team that brings the best when it comes to human interaction and care. I am very proud of my team tonight, and I am proud of Russia!”\nLuceo Spa is the ultimate destination for holistic spa experiences, unique for St. Petersburg. The venue is beautifully integrated into the palatial structure – Luceo is built into one of the Lion Palace’s original courtyards and occupies four floors, featuring eight treatment rooms and a beautiful relaxation pool on the top level under a glass dome. Luceo Spa uses three prominent product lines for treatments: Santa Maria Novella, Omorovicza and Ila. The Spa is the only place in St. Petersburg where these products are available, and many guests are wowed by the fact that they can now have unique treatments and also buy their favourite products for use at home.\nSince May 2015, Luceo Spa also presents a line of treatments by Swiss premium brand Dr. Burgener, created exclusively for the spa in St. Petersburg. Traditions of using the best natural ingredients are combined with newest technologies for the best results.\nMartin Rhomberg, General Manager of Four Seasons Hotel Lion Palace St. Petersburg, says: “We are thrilled and honoured to receive this award. It’s a great testimony to the vision of our ownership and the hard work of the team. At Four Seasons we proudly operate all our spas, and Luceo Spa has played a crucial role in the positioning or our Hotel. We are very grateful to everyone that recognised this effort, to Wdson and of course his team of wonderful professionals.”\nLuceo Spa has also recently won the prestigious Country Award: Best Wellness Property in Russia by Spafinder Wellness Travel Awards 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T01:27:49.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
