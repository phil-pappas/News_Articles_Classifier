Today's unveiling of the expanded Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) research center highlights the increasing availability of crash avoidance technologies in new vehicles.\n\"Automakers already offer advanced safety features like frontal crash prevention on a wide range of vehicles. Today, 60 percent of new vehicle models include frontal crash prevention as standard or optional equipment. We appreciate the leadership of NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind and the support of other organizations, such as IIHS, to encourage the adoption of this technology.\n\"As manufacturers work to integrate these new safety systems, programs such as the IIHS Top Safety Pick Plus and NHTSA New Car Assessment Program provide useful points of reference to help inform consumers of the benefits of this technology.\"\nThe Association of Global Automakers represents international motor vehicle manufacturers, original equipment suppliers, and other automotive-related trade associations.
