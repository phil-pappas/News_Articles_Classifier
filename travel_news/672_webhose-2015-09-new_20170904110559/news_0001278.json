Recline is managed through an articulated bottom, which moves the seat forward as the back of the chair tilts back -- effectively improving leg room across the board. As with most modern premium cabin designs, there are also power ports at each seat, though USB ports still aren't an option.Unique to United are a few design quirks that add up to icing on the premium cabin cake. Within each of the tray tables, United's cabin designer, PriestmanGoode, included a notch for propping up tablets, effectively giving flyers a better solution for holding up their personal entertainment without any awkward positioning. The airline also updated the cocktail table between each of the seats with premium, granite surfacing. United's cabin updates come at an opportune time for the airline as it continues to rake in cash from a strong travel economy and inexpensive fuel. With books securely in the black, the airline can confidently focus on updating its fleet -- one that's among the oldest in the country -- for the next generation of travelers.The updates also come at a time when many of the legacy US carriers are turning their focus to premium travelers. American, Delta and United have all recently invested heavily in not only their cabin designs but also in the experience surrounding first class travel in order to create a comprehensive and exclusive product suitable for lucrative, premium travelers. United's latest update helps bring its short-haul fleet up to speed with the rest of its livery.Cabin retrofits are slated to begin later this year on United's A319 fleet. Throughout 2016, the updates will extend to the airline's A320, 737 and 757 aircraft.More details on the rollout and seat designs can be found in United's Newsroom .", "external_links": ["http://www.bloomberg.com/visual-data/best-and-worst//oldest-fleets-airlines", "http://newsroom.united.com/2015-09-10-United-Airlines-Unveils-New-Premium-Seat-for-200-Narrowbody-Aircraft"], "published": "2015-09-14T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T14:27:02.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
