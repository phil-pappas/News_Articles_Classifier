And in dramatic fashion, in the span of a few short days this week, the Guatemalan Congress voted to strip Pérez Molina of his immunity from prosecution in the ongoing corruption probe. Pérez Molina resigned just before midnight on Wednesday, and Congress accepted his resignation on Thursday , swearing in 79-year-old Alejandro Maldonado as the country’s new president.\nNot long after, also on Thursday, a judge ordered Pérez Molina held in provisional prison pending the continuance of a criminal hearing on whether he will formally face a corruption trial. That hearing is scheduled to continue on Tuesday, and Pérez Molina – who has gone from Guatemala City’s Presidential Palace to the Matamoros military prison – will spend Sunday’s general elections behind bars, a hard-fought victory for many of the country’s advocates for justice.\nHere’s a look back in photos of that dramatic, tenacious and peaceful protest movement that since April has been inspiring the world.\nDemonstrators hold signs during a protest against Guatemala’s former President Otto Pérez Molina and former Vice President Roxana Baldetti in Guatemala City, on April 25, 2015.\nJohan Ordóñez/AFP\nConstitution Square, Guatemala City, May 16, 2015.
