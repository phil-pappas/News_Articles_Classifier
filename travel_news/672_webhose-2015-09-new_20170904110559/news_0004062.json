For those who live on the road in a permanent state of travel, proper packing procedures are even more crucial. Following are some tried-and-true solutions for functioning with limited luggage space. \nSelection: Checking electronic gear is never a good idea. So if you find yourself traveling with a great deal of it, you may find the amount of extra clothing you’re used to bringing on board to protect yourself from the possibility of lost-luggage stress needs to be seriously curtailed. Choosing those items carefully is critical. Avid traveler and expat lifestyle expert Nina Alexander chooses to limit her carry-on clothing items in ways that provide wardrobe flexibility while maintaining a sense of city chic. \nFor example, instead of the classic denim jacket many casual travelers favor, Alexander opts for a short black leather one instead. It looks great with her one knee-length evening dress while adding polish to other outfits as well. Additionally, while she limits her T-shirt selection to a maximum of three, she chooses ones that are thin, come in a plain color and walk the line between active and dressy. This way, she can pair them with jewelry and a thin scarf for an evening out on the town. \nPerhaps the most powerful packing choice she makes with regards to minimal-space clothing is opting for skinny jeans as her go-to pants option. Not only can these be dressed up with a nice T-shirt, heels and minimal jewelry, they can also meet your needs for sweater-weather strolls. As a plus-sized woman traveler, I love this tip for a few reasons. \nFirst of all, skinny jeans take up far less room in my luggage than the wider leg variety. Second, they work as an alternative to leggings for some of my favorite fall outfits and pair well with knee boots and long tops for a flattering look that works for a variety of figure types. This way, if I want to use my go-to black travel leggings for a hotel workout, I am not left waiting until laundry day before donning an outfit that’s geared toward that type of pants. \nSize: When I have room to spare, an accordion file has always been at the top of my packing list for wrangling important papers. However, when space gets tight I tend to opt for a two-pocket portfolio or a clasp envelope that I can stuff documents and receipts into for sorting and scanning at a later date. It’s a much thinner solution for packing and allows for those situations where digital copies aren’t necessarily something you can make happen immediately. \nA good in-between option is a personal organizing portfolio with tech pockets, card slots and elastic bands for securing electrical odds and ends. When it comes to width and storage flexibility, they strike a nice balance between binders and more basic gear inserts for your pocketbook. Knomo makes a highly functional one that can handle everything from small notebooks and writing utensils to tablets, smartphones and even extra charging batteries. Dubbed the Knomad Air, it’s a personal organizer you can tuck inside a tote, carry in a bicycle pannier or even carry on its own during your daily commute. \nIf the travel-sized bottles at the drug store are still too bulky and flat sample packs of your favorite liquid toiletries aren’t readily available, you may find Squeeze Pods to be a workable alternative. With multipacks of single-use items such as hair gel, shampoo and other popular hygiene products starting at less than $3, it’s an affordable way to go when it comes to packing light. Bonus? All of their products are certified cruelty-free by PETA. \nHowever, be advised that opening these things in the shower can be a bit easier to say than do. During a recent attempt to use one of the body care pods while under the spray, I managed to manufacture a major manicure malfunction that left me swearing like a sailor about the consequent delay in my departure. While my husband’s beard scissors eventually solved the problem in my situation, air travelers may want to give each pod a snip with nail clippers or another TSA-friendly tool prior to use. \nStreamlining: Serious road warriors with a wide range of items to pack can begin to question their sanity after having to double check for charging cords and other necessary items for several destinations in a row. That’s where having a customized list can come in handy. International comedian and former tech specialist Dan Nainan has his on a printable spreadsheet, where he can highlight which items apply to a particular flight. He never deals with checked baggage and manages to pack everything from collapsible tripods, Sharpies and thumb drives to clothing, snacks and earplugs using only the luggage he’s allowed in the plane’s cabin. \nFull-time traveler and animal rescue volunteer Stephanie De La Garza has been living life on the road for more than two years, carrying all of her belongings with her as she goes. While she turns to Space Bags as a consistent solution for creating extra room in her luggage, De La Garza is the first to admit they are prone to rips. Her simple repair solution? Creating a reduced-size roll of duct tape by cutting a cardboard toilet tissue tube to the same width as the tape, and then rolling a small supply around that tube that can then be squashed flat to save space. When it comes time to patch one of her compression bags, she’s able to do so for pennies. \nMyscha Theriault is a best-selling author and avid traveler.
