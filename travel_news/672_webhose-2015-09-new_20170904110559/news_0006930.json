Along the way we stopped at a place called Robbieâ€™s where you can feed tarpon. The tarpon have learned to hang out around the docks because they know that people will feed them fish. \nWhen they take the fish, however, it is a pretty sudden and violent experience. Usually they just grab the fish out of your hand, but occasionally, they will also put their mouth around your hand, which is exactly what happened to my friend Justin in this photo.
