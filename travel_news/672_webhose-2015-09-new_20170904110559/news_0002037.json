Bid speculation sent smaller peer Boohoo up 13.9 per cent to its highest level since a January profit warning. \nGVC , the online gaming operator that last week agreed a reverse takeover of Bwin.party slid 6.3 per cent to a 15-month low. The company said yesterday that Kenneth Alexander, chief executive, had bought about £250,000 in shares. \nFinnish packaging maker Powerflute rose 14.6 per cent on interim results showing earnings more than doubling, due to its acquisition last year of a business from Stora Enso. \nHaynes Publishing lost 6.9 per cent after the car manual specialist said it would begin an operational and cost review. Annual results due this month will show a loss due to a non-cash goodwill impairment relating to its US operations, Haynes warned. \nITM Power pumped up by garage forecourt contract \nShares in ITM Power jumped 15 per cent this week after it agreed a deal to install three refuelling points for hydrogen-powered cars in Shell petrol stations, writes Conor Sullivan. \nThey will be the first points to appear on traditional retail forecourts, and the hydrogen will be generated on-site using water and renewable sources of electricity such as solar or wind. \nA £1.9m government grant from the Office for Low Emission Vehicles will part-fund the scheme while £1.7m of EU money will support the stations’ operation in the early years. \nHouse broker Zeus Capital said the deal is “an exciting landmark event for ITM, and is another strong indication of the direction in which future low/zero carbon mass transportation is heading”. \nThe company has a market cap of £50m and reported a loss of £5.6m for the year to April. It said it would become profitable once hydrogen-fuel systems are more widely adopted. This year construction equipment maker JCB made a £4.9m “strategic” investment in ITM in return for a 9 per cent stake. \nSQS to tackle glitch in software testing margins \nShares in SQS , which tests for bugs in software for companies including insurer Allianz and oil group BP, dipped sharply last week to 480p after the company warned that full-year profits would be below board expectations , writes Kate Burgess . \nInvestors in the stock have had a good run in the past couple of years as SQS has expanded further into Europe, Asia and the US. First-half revenues to June rose 16 per cent to €150m and pre-tax profits, including from acquired businesses, rose from €3.7m to €5.2m. \nBut margins have come under pressure in its traditional software testing business. SQS said it would tackle this by cutting costs and staff and focusing on its bigger, more profitable clients in its managed services division. \nThe company’s net debt, used to pay for acquisitions and capital expenditure, rose from €8.9m to €26.5m. \nShares in SQS rose steadily from 200p to almost 600p between 2012 and 2014, but have since fallen back. \nGoals Soccer Centres fails to score as demand slumps \nShares in Goals Soccer Centres fell faster than a prima donna in the penalty area this week after lacklustre demand hit profits at the operator of five-a-side-football pitches, writes Joel Lewin . \nThe stock slumped 18 per cent to a two-year low after it said its earnings were squeezed “as team organisers struggled to find sufficient players for their game to go ahead, as players took advantage of the strong pound during a period of poor UK weather to holiday abroad”. \nIn addition, the lack of an exciting football tournament to motivate players resulted in “a slow summer period compared to the post World Cup uplift experienced last year”. \nLike-for-like sales fell 1 per cent on a year earlier to £17.1m in the six months to June, while its earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortisation dropped 11 per cent to £6.2m. \nBut football is a game of two halves, and the company is upbeat after cranking up its marketing in the UK and betting on the US, where it is building several new centres after its Los Angeles base delivered a 22 per cent rise in sales.
