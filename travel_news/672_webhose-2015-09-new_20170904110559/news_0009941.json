On August 2, the Frankfurt international hub registered a new historic daily traffic record - with some 217,500 passengers served in a single day. In addition, the number of passengers per flight rose again to 156.3, surpassing the July 2015 figure of 152.4. Correspondingly, aircraft capacity utilization at Frankfurt Airport reached an all-time high of 85.5 percent. The number of aircraft movements increased slightly by 0.2 percent year-on-year to 42,787 takeoffs and landings. Accumulated maximum takeoff weights (MTOWs) grew by 2 percent to more than 2.7 million metric tons. Cargo (airfreight and airmail) dropped by 4.2 percent to 172,055 metric tons, attributable to the weakness in world trade, especially in the Far East. \nAmong the Fraport AG's Group airports, Slovenia's capital city airport Ljubljana (LJU) again reported dynamic growth of 10.4 percent to about 180,000 passengers in August 2015. Lima Airport (LIM) in Peru, South America, had equally satisfying figures in August 2015, with traffic advancing by 8.5 percent to 1.6 million passengers. Welcoming more than one million passengers, Bulgaria's Twinstar airports of Varna (VAR) and Burgas (BOJ) together registered a 2.9 percent decline. Turkey's Antalya Airport (AYT) showed a slight decrease of 0.5 percent to 4.5 million passengers. St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Airport (LED) in Russia received 1.7 million passengers, down 3.7 percent year-on-year. Hanover Airport (HAJ) in northern Germany reported positive results for August 2015, with traffic rising by 3.8 percent to about 590,000 passengers.

In 2014, the Fraport Group generated sales of €2.4 billion and profit of about €252 million. Last year more than 108.5 million passengers used airports around the world in which Fraport has more than a 50 percent stake. \nAt its Frankfurt Airport (FRA) home base, Fraport welcomed about 60 million passengers and handled some 2.2 million metric tons of cargo (airfreight and airmail) in 2014. For the current summer timetable, FRA is served by 104 passenger airlines flying to some 297 destinations in 104 countries worldwide. More than half of FRA's destinations are intercontinental (beyond Europe) - underscoring Frankfurt's role as a leading hub in the global air transportation system. In Europe, Frankfurt Airport ranks first in terms of cargo tonnage and is the third-busiest for passenger traffic. With about 55 percent of all passengers using Frankfurt as a connecting hub, FRA also has the highest transfer rate among the major European hubs. \nFrankfurt Airport City has become Germany's largest job complex at a single location, employing more than 80,000 people at some 500 companies and organizations on site. Major new real estate developments - such as The Squaire, the Gateway Gardens business park, and the Mönchhof Logistics Park - are creating an exciting new dimension and range of services at the evolving Frankfurt Airport City of the 21st century. \nAlmost half of Germany's population lives within a 200-kilometer radius of the FRA intermodal travel hub - the largest airport catchment area in Europe. FRA Airport City also serves as a magnet for other companies located throughout the economically vital Frankfurt/Rhine-Main-Neckar region. Thanks to synergies associated with the region's dynamic industries, networked expertise, and outstanding intermodal transportation infrastructure, FRA's world route network enables Hesse's and Germany's export-oriented businesses to flourish in global growth markets. \nFrankfurt Airport meets the increasing needs of the export-oriented economies of the State of Hesse as well as Germany as a whole, for optimal connections to growth markets around the globe. Likewise, FRA is a strategic gateway for companies wanting to access the huge European marketplace. Thus, Frankfurt Airport - which is strategically located in the heart of Europe - is one of the most important hubs in the global logistics chain.
