In addition to the opening, an event that had been long-awaited, the scenic spot, which is located in Zunyi, Guizhou province, also issued an announcement seeking to recruit archaeological volunteers worldwide and inviting them to participate in Hailongtun's archaeological journey. On the day of the opening of the site to the public, the international archaeological exchange station also started formal operations. With a history going back more than 700 years, Hailongtun is home to many valuable historic and archaeological artifacts, in addition to the magnificent and steep natural landscape and marvelous architecture. A more scientific and comprehensive modern approach to archaeological surveys started at Hailongtun in the 1970s and 1980s. In the autumn of 1999, the survey team conducted a systematic investigation into Hailongtun and the immediate vicinity as well as a small-scale archaeological excavation at the sites of the New and Old Palaces. This was also the first archaeological excavation in Hailongtun's history. \nGiven Hailongtun's huge potential in archaeological excavation, the scenic spot decided to kick off a worldwide archaeological volunteers recruitment drive, in a move to bring together individuals who are highly supportive of efforts to conserve historical culture and mobilize more people to keep and protect the world's great collection of cultural heritage. Volunteers are invited to participate in Hailongtun's archaeological journey and share their experiences with those with similar interests at the international archaeological exchange station. The practical focus of the mission will be to find more fragments of civilization in the ruins. \nThe Hailongtun scenic spot looks forward to many talented archaeology experts convening at the international archaeological exchange station. Through their tireless exploration and questioning, new historically important details about Hailongtun are expected to become increasingly clear, providing new materials and perspectives for historical and cultural research while encouraging more people to cherish the world's heritage. \nHailongtun's Worldwide Archaeological Volunteers Recruitment \nRecruitment Time: September 27 th to October 30 th \nRegistration Method: Online\nPlease email your personal information to liujucai@legend-ti.com \nFor inquiries, please contact: Mr. Liu, +86-139-8490-6862 \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150922/269179 \n\nSOURCE Office of the Application to World Heritage for Hailongtun, Huichuan District, Zunyi", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T16:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T16:37:01.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
