Made of bright white limestone, the Anamosa State Penitentiary appears regal. It’s nickname is the White Palace of the West. \nThe view from the outside is the closest most Iowans want to get to being inside. But tucked just behind the prison, and open to the public, is the Anamosa State Penitentiary Museum. \nThe museum, open seasonally from Memorial Day Weekend through the first Saturday in October, houses a wealth of history about the 140-year-old prison. The museum was dreamed up by John Thalacker, warden from 1988 to 1995, said Don Folkerts, president of the museum association. \nThe museum itself is located inside a building that once housed a cheese factory. A display takes visitors back to the construction of the prison. The first inmates arrived in 1873. \nAn exhibit features a gin pole crane, which prisoners used to lift and move heavy stone used in construction. A pulley system allowed two inmates to hand-crank the pulley to load or unload stone, Folkerts explained. \nFive inmates lost their lives during construction of the prison. \nElsewhere in the museum, there are exhibits about the penitentiary’s most infamous prisoners, including John Wayne Gacy Jr. Gacy was convicted in 1980 of murdering 33 young men and teenagers and spent two years in the prison in the 1960s. \nThere are now 1,050 inmates in the prison, Folkerts said. The average age of a prisoner is 35 and the average sentence is 15 years. \nAnother exhibit contains contraband made by prisoners, including blades and a makeshift tattoo gun. \nThere is artwork made by prisoners on display, too. Visitors can see a detailed scale model of the prison made by a lifelong inmate, for example. \n“He asked his supervisor one day if he could build a scale model. Of course, it had to go up the chain of command a couple of times, (but) as you can see they finally said yes,” Folkerts said. \nIn addition, guests can learn about prison life through photographs and exhibits, such as one that focuses on prison dining. \nVisitors also can step inside a replica of a cell and see examples of various forms of restraints used on prisoners. \nThe museum is now in its fourteenth season of operation. In 2014, the museum had 1,000 visitors. \n“There is a mystique about prison museums that really piques a lot of people’s interests, and the fact that we have a running penitentiary in addition to that … there are different museums around the country but usually the institution has been closed down,” Folkerts said. \nFolkerts said the Anamosa museum receives several bus tours a year. Those tours also stop at the National Motorcycle Museum and Grant Wood Art Gallery. Wood was born in Anamosa. If you go \nWhat: Anamosa State Penitentiary Museum \nWhere: 406 N.
