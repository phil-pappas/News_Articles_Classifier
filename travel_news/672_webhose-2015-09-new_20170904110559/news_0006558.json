The excitement, anticipation and of course angst of the occasion led to a severe lack of sleep. We get very nervous. We're probably worse than the players. Friday morning dawned and my thoughts were with Courtney, knowing that I was doing the worrying for the both of us. To be fair, I don't speak to him. I just send best wishes via Jess, his partner. The way I see it is that my son is at work and I don't like to bother him at work. It's like the guys over in Afghanistan. They have to concentrate on what they're doing. I think it's quite gladiatorial. The three of us, my husband Linford, our younger son Cameron and myself left Northampton for Twickenham at midday. The journey was very stop/start which did nothing to improve my nerves but we were all in good spirits and arrived at Twickenham two hours later. The crowds were beginning to gather as we collected our tickets, the atmosphere and excitement mounting. We sat near the great statue of the Spirit of Rugby taking in the event watching the crowds with their national flags from around the world. Meeting the players’ family and friends O2 had put on an event for families and friends of the England players which cranked up the excitement yet again. Everyone was laughing, there were English roses being painted on faces - even mine! I confess to being a face-painting virgin. It was a wonderful event much appreciated by the families. It's so nice to see all the parents that you've come through the England journey with. The physios’ families are there. It's just nice to get to know them – it is like an extended family group. Courtney's partner Jess went to Pennyhill and came across on a bus with the other wives and partners. Courtney and Jess's two children, my grandchildren, are looked after by Jess's mum. An emotional wreck We left the families’ meet-up early to get to our seats in the stadium. The whole build up to the opening ceremony was lovely. The singing along, the sitting with the rest of the families and friends... we had a great laugh, we really did. We also sit together during the game. There's a whole group of us in the stands. The pre-opening singalong of Sweet Caroline has never been sung with such gusto and emotion. I already had a lump in my throat, and I was fast becoming an emotional wreck. Then the opening ceremony was amazing, on point, and not too long. Awesome to see the young royals there, and of course the legends of the game. The atmosphere and noise in the ground was truly magnificent. You want to be in amongst the crowd and enjoying the atmosphere and the joviality. It's brilliant. When the teams were out for the national anthems I could look down and see my son, which always makes me extremely proud and emotional, but when the national anthem is sung I always well up and shed a tear. The church of England rugby Twickenham is truly the church of English rugby and the emotions it stirs in everyone who attends is truly remarkable. The abiding memory will be of the emotion of being there at the opening of the Rugby World Cup and absorbing everything that was going on. Although I enjoyed the game, I never really see it properly until I get home. The excitement and things you 'think' you see, the decisions made sometimes don't make sense, but when you get home and see it on the TV it all becomes clearer. I try to find Courtney to check where he is. It means I miss a lot of the game. It's nice to come home and watch it again. During the game I tend to track Courtney. His knee is always strapped up. Because my boys are so tall, their ligaments can be quite sensitive and delicate, dare I say. It's more for support than anything else. I've never been overly worried. I look down and see he's had a knock on the field and you worry that he gets up and he's OK. There's always that natural worry. But I don't think we're overly concerned. I did watch the documentary on the risk of brain injury for rugby players on Panorama this week. I think there's risk in life whatever you do. The training they have also helps them. It's not like they go in gung-ho. Post-match was back at the venue for the families. Everyone was there and eventually the lads came up to see us. I saw Courtney very briefly after the game. It was just a quick hug. It's always a relief to see Courtney after any game to make sure he's OK. It's nice to know he's fit and he hasn't had too many knocks. The players like to see their families, their partners and their mums and dads. I think it's just a touch of normality for them. But I don't do game analysis with him - it's more \"family\" things we chat about. We eventually got home in the early hours of Saturday morning tired and happy. A good start to the campaign – a win and a bonus point to boot.
