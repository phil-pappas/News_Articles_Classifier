It presents current penetration of analogue, hybrid, and fully digital displays, and determines how those percentages will shift as demand increases for head-up displays that reduce driver distraction. It details display technologies and the information that is most likely to be incorporated in instrument clusters of the future, and reviews what is available in current models. User interface suppliers are benchmarked, with information provided about operating systems and collaborations. The base year is 2014; the forecast period is from 2015 to 2021.\nKey Questions This Study Will Answer\n- What are the basic IC segments?\n- What are the differences between IC technologies?\n- What is the current market scenario? What factors influence OEMs in implementing ICs in passengers cars?\n- What are the future implementation possibilities of fully digital and hybrid ICs?\n- Which IC has higher potential for market penetration, and what factors will influence that penetration?\nKey Findings\nFully digital instrument clusters are still available only in high-end luxury models, but they will soon begin to trickle down into mid- and low-cost vehicles.\nThe instrument cluster (IC) market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of % from 2014 to 2021 across North America and European Union (EU) countries. Analogue ICs are expected to become obsolete by 2021.\nAbout % of cars shipped by 2021 across Europe and North America are expected to be deployed with hybrid ICs, and the other % are expected to be fully digital ICs.\nDownload the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3113619/\nAbout Reportbuyer\nReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers\nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com\nFor more information:\nSarah Smith\nResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.com\nEmail: query@reportbuyer.com\nTel: +44 208 816 85 48\nWebsite: www.reportbuyer.com\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rise-of-virtual-cockpits-in-cars-300143815.html\nÂ©2015 PR Newswire.
