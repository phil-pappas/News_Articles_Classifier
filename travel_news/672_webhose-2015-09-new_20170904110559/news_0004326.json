The products aim to give new-to-cruise and seasoned cruisers greater insight to help choose the right ship and prepare for upcoming trips.\nColleen McDaniel , managing editor of Cruise Critic, explained, \"The new images bring the ships to life and give a real sense of what it will be like when you step onboard. Our aim is to provide a rich depth of content to help people find and plan the right cruise. Combining Oyster's photography expertise with new cruiser-submitted photos, we're able to deliver the best possible insights to help consumers feel more confident and informed when booking and planning a cruise.\"\nFeatures of Cruise Critic's new virtual tours include:\nEasy-to-browse, high-resolution photo libraries of thousands of images per ship Real-life, unaltered photos of every onboard nook and cranny, taken by Oyster's photographers Categorized folders, including: Activities and Events, Cabins, Family Amenities, Pools and Sundecks, Restaurants and Bars, Spa and Fitness and Ports of Call Public spaces documented as they change over the course of the cruise -- for example: a bustling pool deck at night that becomes a tranquil scene when the ship is in port New 360-degree panoramic imagery to make it easier to perceive public areas and cabins Over 27,000 photos across 11 ships and six cruise lines, including Holland America, Norwegian, Princess, Royal Caribbean, Carnival and Celebrity – with more ships and lines continuing to be added Speaking on the partnership, Eytan Seidman , Co-Founder and General Manager of Oyster.com, said, \"We share a common core principle with Cruise Critic to provide clear, unbiased information that will help people to choose the right vacation for their needs. Of course, cruise ships are a lot larger than the average hotel, so adapting the formula that has proved highly successful for hotels to cruise ships, meant lengthening the shoot, and taking more than five times as many images. It's a huge task but very rewarding, and we're incredibly pleased with the results.\"\nCruise Critic also launched photo collection as part of its cruise review process, enabling travelers to upload ship photos to create multimedia reviews and share their own first-hand views of the ships on which they've sailed. As the world's leading cruise reviews site, Cruise Critic features more than 150,000 consumer reviews representing nearly 500 cruise ships.\nView an example of Cruise Critic's new virtual tours:\nNorwegian Getaway Ship Tour\n360 Panoramic View of Freedom of the Seas' Owners Suite\nAbout Cruise Critic\nCruise Critic ® is an online cruise guide, offering a comprehensive resource for cruise travelers, from first-time cruisers to avid cruise enthusiasts.
