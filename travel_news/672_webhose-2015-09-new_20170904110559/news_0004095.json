Guatemala Issues alarm: Dengue Fever   \nSep 20, 2015   \nGuatemala is a popular travel and tourism destination. Today the government of this Central American country issued a warning. Dengue fever is spreading and has killed. \nVisitors planning to travel to Guatemala should avoid dengue fever to avoid being bitten by the aedes aegypti mosquito, which is active throughout the day but mainly bites at dusk or dawn. Cover up in the evenings, use mosquito repellent and sleep under a mosquito net. No vaccine has been invented. \nIf you happen to wake up in the middle of the night with a migraine that feels like the engine of a fighter plane batting against your retinas, you may be experiencing one of the first symptoms of dengue fever. \nAfter the panicked realisation that your body temperature is approaching that of the Sun, you'll want to fix yourself a nice ice bucket and plonk it beside your pillow. Don't expect to be moving for the next three days, except to periodically lean over and dunk your boiling, sweaty head into the bucket. \nYes, this will turn your hair into a mangled mess of rat-tails and dreadlocks but don't worry: all you'll need to do is drain an entire bottle of conditioner on it once youâ€™ve regained the physical strength to get to a chemist and back. \nSettle into that sweat puddle of a pillow and get comfortable for 3-12 days. You have been blessed with the kiss of a dengue-fever-ridden mosquito. \nWhat to expect: Fever of up to 50 degrees Celsius Pain in the occipital & retina Dizziness and nausea Pain in the lower back Loss of appetite Development of anxiety and/or depression \nDays 3-5: Temporary lowering of body temperature & blood pressure Temporary relief of some or all symptoms, Development of a rash on the arms, palms, face, and neck \nDays 5-7:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T09:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T20:09:40.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
