But for a long while, diners in search of more esoteric Thai fare, intense heat, regional specialties, or a menu not dumbed-down for our American palettes, have had to hoof it out to Queens, to celebrated eateries like Woodside’s SriPraPhai, Elmhurst’s Ayada, or Jackson Heights’s Zabb Elee.\nThen, in the spring of 2012, Andy Ricker came to town with Pok Pok , his Portland, Oregon–based northern Thai mecca. Located on a lonely stretch of the South Brooklyn Waterfront (the neighborhood is technically the Columbia Street Waterfront District, but Ricker has assimilated the restaurant into nearby Red Hook), Pok Pok hocks lesser-known regional Thai delicacies like aromatic minced pork laap and chicken wings so delectably sticky and spicy that they’ve been known to leave this writer’s lips numb.\nFor a long while, Pok Pok didn’t take reservations. The lines were long. The hostesses were attractive and young. They wore headsets and imperiously lorded over the wait list. To contend with the overflow, Ricker opened Whiskey Soda Lounge, a cocktail bar, down the block. The overflow was plentiful. Eventually Ricker consolidated his empire by installing Pok Pok in a larger space a few storefronts down, and moving his noodle-focused Pok Pok Phat Thai from a tiny space on the Lower East Side to the original Pok Pok space. Until he recently closed Whiskey Soda Lounge, Ricker was rolling three restaurants deep on Columbia Street. Hipster Thai food had officially arrived in Brooklyn; the fact that it had come to a place that was only marginally more convenient for most than the outer reaches of Queens was appropriately ironic.\nBut no restaurant can stay hot forever, even one that remains excellent. Last winter, Pok Pok started taking reservations. They announced this just a week after another Thai restaurant, the smaller-scale Kao Soy , which had quietly opened a few months earlier at 283 Van Brunt, deeper into Red Hook, received a rave review from the New York Times food critic Pete Wells . The coincidence of Kao Soy’s proximity to Ricker’s fiefdom was not lost on Wells. “ Several New York neighborhoods have been wrapped in the fiery clutch of Thailand’s northeastern region, Isan,” he wrote. “Dishes from the north, though, have been found almost exclusively in one place, Pok Pok NY, just outside Red Hook. This puts two northern Thai kitchens less than a mile apart in a borough that is home to only about twelve percent of the city’s Thai population, and virtually no other Thai restaurants worth knowing about.”\nKao Soy, the baby of a Red-Hook-born-and-raised contractor named Carlos Padillo and his then-girlfriend, Kanlaya Supachana , a Thai woman from the northern city of Chiang Mai , was named for its signature dish, a delicacy from Supachana’s hometown. At the restaurant Kao Soy, the dish kao soy is comprised of noodles in a broth of spicy yellow coconut curry, topped with chicken thighs and crunchy thin egg noodles, and served with a little plate of condiments—chilies, tiny dried fish—on the side. The pleasure of this dish lies both in its hearty, rich flavor, and in its appealing contrasting textures: thick curry, slippery noodles, melty, soft chicken meat, and the crisp snap of everything that happens on top.\nSince February, when Wells’s review ran, some things have changed. Padillo and Supachana split up, Supachana left Kao Soy, and Padillo brought in a new chef, also a Thai woman, who has made her own mark on the food. The current Kao Soy menu continues to offer much of the old, as well as standard American Thai fare like pad thai and crab rangoon and a smattering of regional dishes from central and southern Thailand. Most customers, says Padillo, who is currently busy building out Kao Soy 2 in Sunset Park, still opt for the restaurant’s original Northern Thai offerings. The Kao Soy, he says, remains largely the same, just a bit more flavorful.\nUntil December, those who want a comparison can just roll five doors down and order Supachana’s version of the dish—based on her father’s recipe, she tells me, and using a proprietary curry mix—at Chiang Mai, the Northern Thai pop-up restaurant she opened with a new partner back in July, just a month after leaving Kao Soy. Chiang Mai is currently operating out of the space usually occupied by local brunch favorite Home/Made (which has temporarily relocated to Atelier Roquette at 63 Commerce Street), but Supachana is looking for a more permanent home, and she hopes to find it in Red Hook. In the meantime, she’s installed a cluster of five gold and black pigs in the restaurant’s window, in honor of a pork-heavy menu featuring dishes like sai-ua (also available at Kao Soy), an herbal pork sausage served with sticky rice and lettuce, and jin som mok, an intensely spicy medley of fermented ground pork, pork skin, and pig’s ear (sounds gross; is amazing).\nI call Andy Ricker, whose Pok Pok menu includes its own version of kao soy with pickled mustard greens and shallots, to ask him what he thinks of Red Hook’s new Northern Thai explosion. He tells me he hasn’t yet been to try either Kao Soy or Chiang Mai, but he intends to go. “I just think it’s an opportunity,” he explains. “Let’s face it: the rents in Red Hook are cheap, operating a restaurant in New York is superexpensive, and operating a restaurant where you’re not charging much for your food is really challenging.” As for whether Pok Pok helped create a Northern Thai trend in Red Hook? He’s less sure about that, but either way, he’s into it. “I think it’s awesome. Has Pok Pok contributed to that conversation? I think so? I’d like to think that we’ve helped to move the needle, to go, Hey, you don’t have to just serve pad thai and rainbow curry and pineapple fried rice. Americans are open and ready and enthusiastic about more specific, regional foods. So I’m happy about it all. I think it’s great!” As do we.", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/11/dining/restaurant-review-kao-soy-in-red-hook-brooklyn.html", "http://www.yelp.com/biz/kao-soy-red-hook", "http://www.yelp.com/biz/chiang-mai-restaurant-red-hook", "http://www.pokpokny.com/home/"], "published": "2015-09-04T03:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T14:38:48.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
