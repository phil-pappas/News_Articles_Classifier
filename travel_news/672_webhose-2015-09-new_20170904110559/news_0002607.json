Mercure, a “locally inspired” brand, has drawn influence for the hotel’s new interior design from Cardiff itself, a contemporary city with its roots in history. Inspired by Cardiff’s Millennium Centre, Bay and Castle, the interior design is permeated with Welsh copper and slate incorporating copper pendant lighting, slate feature wall and Welsh woolen upholstery. \nThe refurbishment has completely transformed the public spaces creating intimate seating areas, stand out design and reclaimed timber effect flooring to deliver a stylish and airy environment for eating, drinking, dining or lounging. The refurbishment is in keeping with Mercure’s welcome concept, which has reinvented the guest experience through a new open-plan and inviting lobby design. Unprecedented in midscale hotels, the new concept is designed to provide guests with a unique and distinguished experience from arrival, which is in harmony with a friendly, flexible and relaxed experience. Restaurant The new dining area, known as the Urban Bar and Kitchen, is an open-plan space with statement booth style seating offset by a magnificent circular bar. Developing the local design concept further, dock-inspired rope installations pervade the contemporary surroundings whilst marine waterways and bay enthused artwork sit alongside historical photography adorning the walls. Inspired by a metropolitan and trendy feel, The Urban Bar & Kitchen menu pays homage to the street food revolution and the increasing influence of Asian dining. There is something for everyone with specialty dishes including five spiced duck breast and tiger prawn linguini alongside welsh steak cuts and inventive burgers. Small plates include gypsy style eggs on toast, pancetta wrapped king prawns and Pembrokeshire crab spring rolls for those looking for a delicious quick bite. Guests will be encouraged to pick from the ‘Flavours from the Cellar’ wine list, which includes three handpicked wines available across the Mercure Hotels in the UK carefully selected by the BBC Saturday Kitchen Masters of Wine, Susie Barrie and Peter Richards. Bedrooms The hotel offers a range of accommodation across its newly renovated 165 bedrooms, including superior rooms, privilege rooms, four Suites and one Presidential Suite ensuring the highest level of luxury comfort. Residing on the 15th floor, the Presidential Suite boasts stunning views across the City, as do the eight corner rooms on each floor, suitable for VIP guests or as a perfect launch event location. Continuing the strong design feel, all bedrooms have been refurbished with quirky artwork paying homage to iconic figures linked to sporting events including Henry VIII holding a cricket bat amongst others. Each bedroom is equipped with a TV including international satellite channels; 24-hour room service and free Wi-Fi access, which is also available throughout the hotel. Spa The hotel is also home to the newly repositioned Spa offering an array of therapeutic treatments promoting rest and relaxation alongside more unusual methods such as Counsillor. Guests can make use of the spacious 16m indoor pool, thermal suite, fully equipped gym, sauna and steam room as part of their stay. MICE Catering for both leisure and business guests, Mercure Cardiff Holland House and Spa is the largest hotel-based conference venue in the city with 15 contemporary meeting spaces. Each conference suite features state-of-the-art multimedia presentation and communications facilities whilst the hotel’s location makes it the ideal choice for the business meetings located just five minutes walk from Cardiff Queen Street Station.

Truly majestic, the Calon Suite is the hotel’s largest space and is situated on the ground floor of the hotel with a separate entrance, reception area and bar.
