We are committed to offering a range of safaris that enable guests to take the safari of their dreams; and once you are there, this life-changing experience will never, ever leave you.\" \nAfrican Travel's new brochure features a well-rounded collection of \" Popular Journeys ,\" which encompass past guests' favorite sojourns; \" Extraordinary Experiences ,\" which are ideal for those who prefer more remote safari experiences; and a variety of \" Added+Adventures \" that put the finishing touches on any dream vacation with highlights such as an island retreat in the Seychelles or an adventure into the misty land of Victoria Falls. \n\"Africa is an enticing destination, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for some and a repeat trip for others,\" said Banda. \"People today want to travel differently, and we excel at providing a range of itineraries to satisfy every guest.\" \nThe brochure also features four exciting 2016 \" Safari Vacation Packages \" designed to accommodate every budget and bucket list. Guests choose set departure dates and benefit from group travel savings while enjoying intimate journeys of two to 12 people and accommodations of the finest caliber.
