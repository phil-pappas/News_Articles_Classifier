But when death or critical illness strikes, the impact can be catastrophic. Protecting against the loss of a key executive Keyman insurance provides a lump sum, payable to the employer, to be used as the employer sees fit. Additional resource is often needed quickly to replace a lost executive. Recruitment of a suitable replacement can be expensive and time-consuming and the insurance payout can go a long way towards mitigating the costs. Sometimes keyman cover is put in place to protect lenders to the business, in which case lump sum benefits may be required to repay debt. Protection against the death of a fellow shareholder is frequently ignored Keyman policies can cover death, critical illness or both. Life cover will pay out swiftly, usually after simply providing a death certificate. Critical illness claims require a diagnosis of an illness defined in the policy – standard conditions include heart attack, stroke, most cancers and such things as multiple sclerosis. When arranging cover, the first question is, how much? A useful rule-of-thumb minimum is one year’s salary. Beyond that, consider the potential loss of income, the additional costs of recruiting and remunerating a replacement plus other requirements such as debt repayment. Naturally, affordability – premium costs – will have a bearing on the level of cover and premiums will rise with age and medical history. Protecting against the death of a fellow owner While keyman cover is not uncommon, protection against the death of a fellow shareholder is frequently ignored, often because it can seem complicated. A company’s articles of association (defining the responsibilities of directors and shareholders) and shareholders’ agreements may provide for the shares to be offered to existing shareholders in the first instance. But if the surviving owners cannot afford to buy back the holding, control of the business can be lost – perhaps to a competitor or another third party with different objectives. That’s where shareholder protection comes in. In general, a policy is taken out on each shareholder that pays out to the other shareholders on death or critical illness. A series of “cross-option” agreements command that these proceeds are used to buy the deceased’s equity. For practical purposes, the value of the shares may have been pre-agreed so that an appropriate level of insurance is in place and the transaction is swiftly concluded. Roger Downes, MD of Cheltenham-based chartered accountants Andorran, adds: I advise clients, at the start of their business lives, about protection in the event of something unforeseen occurring. We talk wills, keyman insurance and, if there are two or more shareholders, protection insurance. Some clients listen to me; others don’t, especially in the case of protection insurance which is often rejected as “yet another cost” or “it won’t happen to me”. Sometimes the client is lucky and nothing untoward happens, but the fallout from getting it wrong can be devastating. It always happens, of course, at an emotionally sensitive time. Take the two friends who I helped set up in business about 12 years ago. Both were in their mid-thirties with no family; they rejected my advice about protection insurance, but took out keyman insurance on both of them. Over the next five or six years, both married and started a family. Two years later one died in an accident. The keyman insurance paid out, but the business needed that for its intended purpose. The widow of the deceased shareholder knew of the payout and assumed that it would be for her benefit. I had to explain that her late husband and the continuing shareholder had opted out of shareholder protection. There were many tears and bitter words before a solution was eventually found. The story therefore has a relatively happy ending; not everyone in similar circumstances will be so fortunate. • Protect your business with the right company car, financed the best way.
