He then briefly has one hand let go of the crane, flashing it on camera before grabbing the crane again and climbing back up. \nUrban climbing has become something of a recent phenomenon, with people making dangerous climbs and posting their efforts after the fact to social media sites, like YouTube. In July, six men were arrested in Vancouver after climbing a crane, and Halifax has seen multiple incidents within the past year.
