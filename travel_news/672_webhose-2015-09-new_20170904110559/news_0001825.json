As Chef Erik says, “All the taste, half the calories.” \nA Vietnamese specialty with a healthy twist is the fresh spring roll, made with crisp green apple and carrot with green oak lettuce, and served with spicy peanut sauce. \nThe Mediterranean is also represented on the menu, with a grilled vegetable salad, the vegetables perfectly cooked without being drenched in oil, and presented with lemon vinaigrette and grilled cheddar. \nAvailable for breakfast, or for taking away, is freshly baked granola, 100 percent natural, and with the baking of enough for only 10 bags per batch in order to maintain quality. \nOnly whole rolled oats are used, sweetened with natural honey and raisins, and with no preservatives or dairy products. Customers ordering more than 10 bags can specify their own personalized recipes, and gift baskets are available for festive seasons and birthdays – a gift that will certainly be appreciated. \nHealthy Twist Bangkok is located at33362/4 Rama 4 KlongtanKhlongtoeBangkok 10110. The restaurant has 36 seats and there is a private room on the third floor for up to 25 people. A projector is available to make this a suitable venue for company functions.
