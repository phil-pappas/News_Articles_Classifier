Contributed Local Real Estate Cars For Sale \nA LL my dreams of luxury holidays feature one thing above all else: being waited on day and night. \nIn gorgeous surroundings, of course. With far-reaching sea views. And anything I want just a quiet command away. \nIt is not as impossible or expensive as you might think. \nAt Samujana villas overlooking the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea on the idyllic island of Koh Samui, the accommodation is so spectacular you feel almost guilty being there. \nYou could hold a party for 50 people in the spacious bedrooms with their outdoor bathrooms amid lush foliage. Although much better to entertain your mates in the vast indoor-outdoor living area overlooking the infinity pool melding with sky and dipping into the sea. \nIt's a bit beyond all expectation for us normal folk. You have to pinch yourself as a reminder you really are there. \nAll this and your personal villa manager with one goal: to pamper and coddle you. \n\"Can you order me a masseuse?\" you might say and within minutes one arrives with towels, fragrant oils and a welcoming smile. \n\"Lunch... mmm... just a simple Thai banquet, not too much fuss,\" you may murmur around midday, and before you can blink, the large timber table is set with pristine napkins and gleaming glassware, and fragrant salads and aromatic curries are coming at you. \n\"Perhaps a champagne cocktail party followed by a gourmet dinner for my friends tonight,\" you could convey to your villa manager and as dusk falls, candles are lit, pool and twinkling lights come on and a personal chef arrives to cook to your request while the friendly kitchen fairies open the champagne. \nSamujana is all about spoiling you because you are worth it. \nNo one does service so well and with more smiles and compliance than the Thai people. \nIt's their culture, and we love it. \nWithin an hour of arriving at Samujana, you'll find you are smiling a lot too. \nThe villas are so large they are perfect for family holidays. \nSpacious bedrooms, large libraries, vast game and media rooms and endless outdoor spaces in verdant gardens will keep the kids entertained while you are lolling about on a sunlounge contemplating your next drink or meal. \nThe villas are tailor-made for large groups, those who just want to arrive, unpack, chill-out by the pool and have everything taken care for them so they don't have to move... unless to take a leisurely wander down to the private beach. \nWe were just two on our visit in June... just the one couple with all this space, a driver on demand, and our villa manager quietly and discreetly in the background, her staff just waiting to bring us cold towels, more ice, fresh fruit, to open wine bottles, make cocktails, fluff up pillows... the indulgence. \nWe will go back with the family another time, spread ourselves in this luxurious space and count our blessings. \nThe writer was a guest of Samujana.
