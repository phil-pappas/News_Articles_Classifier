Sponsored by a nonprofit environmental foundation, the campaign stages a series of Sea & Learn events featuring hands-on involvement with research biologists. New opportunities this year include collecting moth specimens, listening to whale “singing” with a marine biologist, searching for the island’s endangered racer snake and going on a geology tour by boat, taxi or hike.\nIn addition to guiding field expeditions, scientists offer evening presentations on their findings, often during happy hour events at local bars and restaurants. With the exception of school field trips, all activities are free and open to the public throughout October.\nEXPLORING A NEW PARK IN PATAGONIA\nIn Transit Travel news, deals and tips, written by the editors and reporters of the Travel section.
