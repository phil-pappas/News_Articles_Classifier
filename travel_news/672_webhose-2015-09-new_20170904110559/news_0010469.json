CNBC's Phil Han reports from the Monaco Yacht Show.\nBekier likened the competition for market share to \"an arms race\" in which $1.3 trillion of tourism infrastructure is being developed around the world.\n\"Countries are making it easy for people to come and visit not just once but multiple times,\" he said. \"That's what we have to compete against. We can't just sit back and say 'well our beaches are better'.\"\nAustralia-based Chinese student Enni Guan embodies Bekier's concerns.\nLeading her visiting parents and grandmother along a Sydney harbor walk to the world-famous Opera House, she said her relatives never would have made the trip from Guangzhou without her to guide them.\n\"My parents only go out when I can accompany them,\" 23-year-old Enni says, citing the lack of Chinese signage in Australia's gateway city. \"They will never come to Australia again if I am not with them.\"\nRead More Fonterra raises milk payout, full-year profits soar\nA rapid increase in Chinese visitors has been welcomed by both countries as they deal with plunging prices for their top export earners - iron ore in Australia and milk powder in New Zealand.\nAustralia's resource-based economy is struggling with the demise of a once-in-a-lifetime mining investment boom, with growth below expectations and almost zero in the last quarter.\nDriven by Chinese arrivals, tourism overtook coal as Australia's second-largest export earner last year, raking in A$102 billion ($71 billion), while in New Zealand it is poised to leapfrog dairy as the top earner.\n\"This is going to be the next mining boom,\" said Bekier, whose Echo, along with rival Crown Resorts , is pinning the success of multibillion dollar new developments in Sydney and Brisbane on high-rolling Chinese gamblers.\nNew Zealand's central bank noted that tourism was one of the few supportive factors in the economy when it announced its third consecutive cut in interest rates earlier this month.\nRead More Omnishambles! What's with Australian politics?\n\"In the past year and half, New Zealand has become a hot destination,\" said Stephen Lester, general manager of Ngai Tahu Tourism, where Chinese tourists now account for a quarter of revenues, up from less than 2 percent four years ago.\n\"Just in terms of pure money in the door, (China's) really important.\"\nTourism Australia expects spending by Chinese tourists to more than double from A$5.7 billion last year to A$13 billion by 2020. However some believe those estimates are hugely optimistic, given Australia's lack of readiness.\nIHG/Oxford Economics predicts that Australia will not rank in the top 10 markets for forecast growth in Chinese visitors in the next decade.\nNorth of Sydney, the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland state is one of Australia's biggest tourism drawcards. But even here, many resorts have not been upgraded since a wave of Japanese investment in the 1980s.\nThe state government is so worried it has issued a plea for foreign investors to take advantage of the weak Aussie dollar and snap up some cheap tourism assets.
