This is because a hole has appeared within the existing work compound, in an area that was being excavated to repair the original highway collapse, and it is possible that this hole may extend under the westbound carriageway. The westbound carriageway was recently reopened, with a contraflow enabling traffic to travel in both directions.\n\"We are working closely with United Utilities to make sure this can be made safe as an urgent priority, enabling repair work on the wider highway collapse to continue, and get the westbound carriageway reopened as quickly as possible. Diversions which have been in place since the end of August will remain and signing will be reinforced. Motorists travelling to tonight's Manchester City versus Juventus game at the Etihad Stadium are being urged to plan their journeys in advance and allow extra time to get to the ground.\" Diversions:\nLondon Road, Fairfield Street, A665, Hyde Road and Downing Street.\nMotorists can still use the Mancunian Way in both directions between the Chester Road roundabout and the junction with London Road.\nLast updated Tue 15 Sep 2015 Travel Manchester Greater Manchester", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/gmptraffic/status/643734302069555200", "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/444442268196274176/GJ4lzAtc_normal.png", "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/461432535461797888/i7DZKWuf_normal.png", "https://twitter.com/OfficialTfGM/status/643714631891066880", "https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23SinkholeTheSequal", "https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23TfGMtraffic"], "published": "2015-09-15T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:21:28.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
