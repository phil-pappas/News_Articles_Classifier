The 7 days tour to Zambia showcased Kenya Airways flights and the sights and sounds of the destination.\nZambia Tourism Board hopes to capitalize on the growing outbound market from India and increase tourist arrivals to Zambia. Mr Felix Chaila, Managing Director, Zambia Tourism Board says, “India is an emerging source market for us and we want to see a positive growth from this market. This FAM was conducted so that Indian travel trade can get first hand experience of the wonders of Zambia and can promote the destination further in their own country. We hope they will create customized itineraries to Zambia and promote it as a stand alone destination or as add-on to Kenya and South Africa itineraries.”\nThe familiarization trip consisted of agents from Cox & Kings, Beacon Holidays, The Wanderers, Itrip Holidays, JTB travels, Destination Management and World of Vacation along with Lubaina Sheerazi, COO, Blue Square Consultants. The group visited Lusaka, Livingstone, South Luangwa & Lower Zambezi National Parks and enjoyed activities like canoeing in the Zambezi River amongst hippos and crocodiles, day and night game drive in South Luangwa and Lower Zambezi National Park, cruise on African Queen, bush breakfast in South Luangwa National Park and dinner on Royal Livingstone Express Train. Some of the partners who provided support to the FAM include Bushtracks Africa, Sun International, Royal Zambezi Lodge, Mfuwe Lodge, Kafunta River Lodge, Flatdogs Camp, Chiawa Camp, Sausage Tree Camp and the airline Proflight Zambia.\n“Zambia is the new face of Africa and is a safe and secure destination with one of the fastest growing economies in the world. We feel Indians are looking at exploring new and exciting destinations and Zambia is a product they will love. The country has tourist attractions like parks, lakes, rich heritage and culture but the main USP of Zambia remains the World Heritage Site of Victoria Falls, the only natural wonder of the World in Africa and the largest curtain of falling water in the World. One can enjoy activities like Bungee Jumping, helicopter and microlight flight over the famed Victoria Falls. Another interesting feature of the falls is the Devil’s pool, seen by more than 20 million viewers on u-tube and rated by Trip Advisor as the Best natural swimming Pool in the World. It is right at the lip of the Victoria Falls providing a vantage and unforgettable view of the falls at the spot where, Dr. David Livingstone, the Scottish Explorer and Missionary became the first Westerner to see the Victoria Falls in 1855 and uttered the words ‘Scenes so lovely, they must have been gazed upon by angels in their flight’ and ‘By far the finest sight I have seen in Africa’. Moving forward, we plan to conduct more familiarization trips, focused network events for trade, branding activities and one-on-one sales meetings in India with the help of our India representative Blue Square Consultants.” added Mr Chaila.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T14:07:45.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
