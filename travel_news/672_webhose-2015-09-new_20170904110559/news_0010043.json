Specifically designed for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and industrial Internet of Things (IoT) applications, the new Cinterion® M2M module meets the market need of power-optimized performance and single-mode LTE at speeds of up to 10Mbit/s download and 5Mbit/s uplink. This makes it an ideal solution for IoT applications such as metering, tracking and tracing, fleet management and mHealth that require the longevity and reliability of LTE in the decades ahead as 2G and 3G networks phase out. The rugged Cinterion ELS31 is the first in a series of leading edge M2M-optimized LTE products from Gemalto. The solution delivers a long lifespan, significant bandwidth and power efficiencies and a feature set specific to the needs of industrial IoT solutions such as extended operating temperatures from -40°C to 85°C. Sharing the same footprint as existing Cinterion industrial portfolio products, the new module enables easy migration to LTE from 2G and 3G devices. All Cinterion modules come with Full Type Approval (FTA) and local network operator certifications to ensure easy integration and a fast time to market for innovative solutions. The Cat 1 LTE module joins the Cinterion family of integrated products leveraging Gemalto's core competencies on Machine Identification Modules (MIMs) TM , managed M2M platforms and security technology required for today's IoT world. \"Mobile networks worldwide are rapidly evolving to LTE, but the vast majority of industrial M2M and IoT solutions don't require high-speed 4G bandwidth for optimal performance,\" said Josh Builta, Associate Director of M2M at IHS . \"LTE Cat 1 modules however provide performance and features that are optimal for most industrial applications, and deliver a cost-effective way to alleviate customers' long-term future proofing concerns.\" \" With M2M connections expected to reach 1 billion by 2020 1 , the new Gemalto Cinterion Cat 1 module paves the way for massive expansion of the IoT marketplace enabling smart, efficient and cost effective use of evolving 4G networks,\" said Axel Hansmann Vice President Portfolio & Strategy M2M at Gemalto. \" The new module is the industry's first step toward true machine type communications offering advantages in size, power and longevity as well as easy integration with Gemalto's market leading MIMs and security technologies for significant value added benefits.\" About IHS ( www.ihs.com ) IHS (NYSE: IHS) is the leading source of insight, analytics and expertise in critical areas that shape today's business landscape.
