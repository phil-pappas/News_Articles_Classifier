Buckwheat flour is used for the batter which maximises the taste and nutritional content of the crepe, and Pepe Saya butter, free range eggs and hand-harvested sea salt make up the remaining core batter ingredients.\nSignature galettes include La Tasmanienne which comes with smoked Tasmanian salmon, capers, crème fraiche and fresh dill, and La Biquette featuring goats cheese, fresh pesto, vine ripened tomatoes and rocket. Prices for the galettes range from $12-$15.\nThe sweet tooths can rest easy knowing Nutella crepes are on the menu, along with La Caramel au Beurre Salé – crepe with salted caramel, slivered almonds and ice cream, and La Crème de Marrons – crepes with freshly made chestnut cream. Prices for the crepes range from $9-$12.\nGeneral Manager for Harbour Rocks Hotel, Dylan Cole, said since opening Creperie Suzette there has been a steady stream of people lining up for their morning coffee and lunch time galette. “It has been a vision of our owners Bob and Ruth Magid to turn the old souvenir shopfront into an intimate space which can be enjoyed by guests of Harbour Rocks Hotel and the local community – and what has been achieved is nothing short of perfection. It is not only the surrounds which people love, it is the quality of the crepes and galettes which is seeing return visitors. One of our missions was to focus on quality, locally sourced produce and authentic service and it is great to see so many people enjoying what we’ve created.”\nCreperie Suzette joins Harbour Rocks Hotel’s other dining establishments, Scarlett Restaurant and Eric’s Bar.\nCreperie Suzette is open seven days a week from 7:30am to 3:30pm.
