This new campaign has been built on the success of past regional campaigns inspired by 5,000 years of history in the oldest part of the country spanning the eastern region from Dublin south to Cork.\nThe campaign is hoping an increase of 20% in international tourist traffic representing an additional 600,000 overseas visitors to the region. The campaign also aims to hike visitor revenue by 25% to $1.07 billion, in total by 2020.\nIreland’s Tourism Minister Paschal Donohoe expects the Ancient East campaign to emulate the success of Wild Atlantic Way which was launched in February 2014. The Wild Atlantic Way campaign focused on the west coast.\nIreland invested $11.3 million to promote 159 destinations along the island’s less visited Atlantic shore and boost arrivals at Shannon Airport, which services the region.\nSpeaking at the European launch of the new campaign in April, Fáilte Ireland CEO Shaun Quinn said, “The Ancient East brand should significantly transform tourism in the region, changing the east and south of this country from a transit zone to a compelling touring region.”\nFáilte Ireland is the national tourism development agency.\nIreland’s Ancient East explains a continuing evolution in tourism brand storytelling where destination marketing organizations are tapping local travel suppliers to share their own stories about their products.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T22:06:12.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
