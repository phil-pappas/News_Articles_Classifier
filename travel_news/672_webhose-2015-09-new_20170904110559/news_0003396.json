In the first two months following deployment, the fleet experienced remarkable improvements in key driver safety indicators, including a 73 percent reduction in handheld use of mobile devices while driving and 66 percent improvement in seatbelt usage, both of which contributed to a 43 percent improvement in its safety score.\nA family-owned company with terminals in Carnesville and Valdosta, GA , and Lakeland, FL , Davis Transfer Company made a strategic decision to invest in technology as the backbone of its safety program. Prior to deploying SmartDrive, the company had already embraced mobile fleet management and trailer tracking solutions in support of fleet safety and operational efficiency, but was lacking clear visibility into what was happening inside the cab and on the road. Davis Transfer selected SmartDrive as a complement to its existing safety initiatives and to augment its data insights for critical decision making.\n\"In our evaluation of video-based safety solutions, we were particularly impressed with SmartDrive's team of safety experts, who were clearly committed to the success of our program,\" stated Todd Davis , president of Davis Transfer Company. \"Other key differentiators that stood out were the innovative coaching and analytics components of the SmartDrive solution, which equip our managers to engage constructively and collaboratively with our drivers to improve outcomes. Drivers are looking for a company that is dedicated to safety and SmartDrive helps us meet this commitment to our employees, customers, and the general public.\"\nDavis Transfer knows that supporting drivers is critical to delivering exceptional customer service, and its focus on safety is core to the company's success. The addition of the SmartDrive program to an already robust safety culture enhanced fleet-wide safety performance, with metrics that include a 67 percent reduction in stopping observations-such as incomplete stops and failure to attempt a stop-and a 19 percent reduction in unsafe following. Davis Transfer credits SmartDrive's video-based solution with visibility to drivers' skills in on-road situations, which improves driver coaching and overall safety outcomes.\n\"Davis Transfer has long recognized the correlation between safety and customer satisfaction, driver retention, and business success, so we are thrilled to partner with this highly respected fleet,\" said Steve Mitgang , CEO of SmartDrive. \"The metrics speak for themselves-a 43 percent improvement in Davis Transfer's safety score in just eight weeks demonstrates the value of SmartDrive's solution and serves as an example of how quickly fleets see measurable results when using our system.\"\nSmartDrive is the industry's only video-based safety program that identifies unsafe driving with an extensible platform, integrating video, vehicle data, audio and driving data for a unified and comprehensive view of risk. The program automatically offloads footage for expert review and analysis, and prioritization for coaching. This saves fleets time and resources, which can then be focused on delivering increased value to their customers; measured in on-time delivery, accuracy and specialized customer service.\nAbout Davis Transfer Company\nDavis Transfer Company services the dry, truckload market with a fleet of more than 200 tractors and almost 800 trailers.
