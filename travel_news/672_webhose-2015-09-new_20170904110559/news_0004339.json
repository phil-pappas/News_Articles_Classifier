On some routes, the cost of purchasing an additional 23kg piece of baggage will be reduced by up to 90 per cent, with a further reduction of up to 30 per cent if pre-purchased directly with Etihad Airways up to 24 hours before travel. \n\nHigher tier members of Etihad Guest loyalty programme will also receive an extra bag or additional weight allowance, depending on the market and route. \n\nPeter Baumgartner, Etihad Airways chief commercial officer, said: “In line with industry best practice, we are moving to a fair and transparent baggage concept. Our new Fare Choices are an easier way for guests to understand what they are paying for, offering clearer pricing and the flexibility which best suits their travel plans. This also applies to their baggage requirements.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T10:51:37.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
