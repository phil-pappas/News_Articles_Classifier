That is the finding of a new survey by TravelMag.com , which compared prices across forty popular city destinations. \nThe findings are based on average hotel prices for the month of September – typically the period that European hotels rates are highest. Only centrally located hotels rated at least three stars and with a positive average client reviews were considered for the survey. \nWith an average of only €29 euros per night for the least expensive double room, Kiev comes rock bottom of the rankings, marginally below the Bulgarian capital of Sofia which averages €30 per night. \nBy contrast, the Italian city of Milan emerged as the most expensive destination with an average price of €135 euros per night, just in front of the Swedish capital of Stockholm (€133). Also among the priciest destinations are Munich (€127), Amsterdam (€119) and Zurich (€116). \nRussian cities Moscow and St. Petersburg rank 27th and 35th, with average rates of €53 and €41 euros, respectively, for the most affordable double room. According to Paul Joseph from TravelMag.com, the fall of the Russian currency and a drop in tourism numbers has had a significant impact on these cities, reducing average rates by an estimated 30-35%. \nThe following table shows the five most expensive and five least expensive cities in Europe according to the survey. The prices shown reflect the average rate for each destination's cheapest available double room (minimum three stars) for the period spanning September 1 through September 30, 2015. \n1.
