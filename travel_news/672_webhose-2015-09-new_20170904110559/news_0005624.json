A spokesperson of the Swedish non-profit organization said that the first airplane will bring refugees to Stockholm before the first snow arrives. \nLegal restrictions made it impossible for people without visas to travel with airlines. In order to help reduce deaths and risky travels in the hands of smugglers, Refugee Air aims to charter airplanes and fly them from Syria to Europe. Many donations, support from the crowd and cooperation with NGOs shall help to realize this project in the near future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T17:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T22:36:19.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
