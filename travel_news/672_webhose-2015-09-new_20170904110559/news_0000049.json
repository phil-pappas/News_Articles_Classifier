Seahorses are protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) because they are over-harvested for aquarium trade and for medical research. \nIn addition to the seahorses, CBP also discovered prohibited pork and fruit in the womanâ€™s baggage, and assessed her a $300 penalty for failing to declare any of it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T05:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T07:24:06.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
