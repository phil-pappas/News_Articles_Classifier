Toyota and Tesla have hugely benefitted from correct market positioning but now Toyota is betting strongly on fuel cell hybrids and Tesla on mainstream pure electric cars - both graveyards for many companies in the past. A vicious shakeout of car and battery manufacturers has commenced with the winners expecting riches beyond the dreams of avarice.\nIDTechEx finds that the global sale of hybrid and pure electric cars will triple to $178.9 billion in 2024 as they are transformed in most respects. For example, components are becoming integrated, the range extender as an optional extra breaks down the difference between pure electric and hybrid and car manufacturers vertically integrate and collaborate, competing with their suppliers.\nThis report covers hybrid vs pure electric cars, premium vs mainstream, homologated vs car-like vehicles. The changing components from power electronics to new motors and supercapacitors are examined including game changers such as structural components. Many interviews are woven into the text as appropriate, with the outcome being forecasts 2014-2024 for number, cost and market value of the different types of car and technology roadmaps.\nDownload the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/2464299/\nAbout Reportbuyer\nReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers\nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com\nFor more information:\nSarah Smith\nResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.com\nEmail: query@reportbuyer.com\nTel: +44 208 816 85 48\nWebsite: www.reportbuyer.com\n releases/future-technology-for-hybrid-and-pure-electric-cars-2015-2025-300141339.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=BR98629&Transmission_Id=201509101914PR_NEWS_USPR_____BR98629&DateId=20150910", "https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/2464299/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-technology-for-hybrid-and-pure-electric-cars-2015-2025-300141339.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.reportbuyer.com/"], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T04:43:50.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
