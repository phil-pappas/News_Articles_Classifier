The large public investments for robot vehicles so far has been for development of technology that works for military purposes. The extension of this type of automated system to commercial fleet vehicles will be rapid after 2020. The robot car designs amalgamate a group of features to represent an automated process solution. These include the hardware, the software middleware, the steering system, adaptive cruise control, numerous software applications, an integrated systems approach, and related services. Significant investments in research and development are necessary as the emerging robot cars market and robot trucks industry builds on incremental technology roll outs.\nGlobal robot cars market driving forces relate primarily to the need for increased safety and personalization for autos. Car manufacturers are positioning with robot car models to meet demand at the high end. Many robot vehicle car vendors are making automation for personal vehicles and trucks a reality. Robot cars market products and trucks incrementally add automated process to driving. As software is added to cars and trucks it is done in concert with modification to the steering, breaking, and other automotive systems. Autonomous functions for vehicles are increasingly adopted.\nCompanies discussed in this 2015 - 2021 robot cars market research include Apple, Allen Vanguard, BAE Systems, BMW, Bosch Group, Chrysler / Dodge, Daimler AG/Mercedes-Benz, ECA Robotics, Elbit Systems, Evatran Group, Ford / Lincoln, Fuji Heavy Industries / Subaru, G-NIUS, General Dynamics, Google Self-Driving Car, GM / Cadillac, Honda, Hyundai, Kairos Autonami, Kongsberg, Lockheed Martin, Mesa Robotics, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Qualcomm, Tata Motors Limited / Jaguar / Land Rover, Tesla, Thales Group, Toyota / Lexus, Uber, Vecna Technologies, Volkswagen, Volvo, Visteon and WiTricity.
