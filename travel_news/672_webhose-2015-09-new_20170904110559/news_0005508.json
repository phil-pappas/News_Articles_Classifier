The plane was completely engulfed in flames and fire fighters did the needful to douse the fire.\nIn the hum dum of trying to get off the plane almost 13 people were injured. They were taken to the city’s Sunrise hospital, most of them with injuries sustained while sliding down inflatable chutes during the evacuation. Flight 2276 was bound for London’s Gatwick airport. There were 159 passengers and 13 crew members on board.\nThe plane took off at first and then came to a sudden halt. The pilot told all to remain seated when the first smell of smoke was detected, then shouted immediate evacuation. The smoke had entered the cabin. The exit gate was opened and people waited to leave the plane as it was declared unsafe. An eye witness said that she found smoke and fire bursting out from the middle of the plane as she was waiting in the airport.\nAn investigation is underway after what could be termed as a lucky save for the passengers. One runway was shut however the other three were working. The Vegas airport of McCarran is a major airport in the US, handling more than 40 million passengers last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T13:57:05.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
