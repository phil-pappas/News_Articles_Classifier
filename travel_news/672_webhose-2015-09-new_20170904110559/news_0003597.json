The museum is keeping the exhibition running because of its popularity.\n\"Mammoths and Mastodons\" debuted at the Field Museum in 2010 and has toured to other museums. It explores the world of the giant creatures through fossils, prehistoric artwork and touchable life-size replicas. Visitors learn about the connection between mammoths and mastodons and their modern cousins, elephants.\nThe exhibit requires a separate admission fee. Tickets can be purchased online at the museum's website.\n___\nOnline: http://www.fieldmuseum.org/", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://www.fieldmuseum.org/", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T21:23:47.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
