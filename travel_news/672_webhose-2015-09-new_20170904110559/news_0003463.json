CSX Corporation President Clarence Gooden received the 2015 Silver Kingpin Award from the Intermodal Association of North America (IANA) for his contributions to the intermodal freight industry, in recognition of more than four decades dedicated to CSX and the growth of its intermodal business.\n\"This prestigious award rightfully recognizes Clarence's steadfast leadership and long-standing commitment to CSX, the intermodal industry and our customers,\" said Michael Ward , chairman and chief executive officer, CSX. \"Thanks to his vision and contributions, CSX and the entire freight rail industry are well-positioned to serve this growing business that is so critical to moving the goods that American consumers need and want.\"\n\"Clarence has been instrumental not only in growing CSX, but in helping to advance our industry as a whole,\" said Joni Casey , president and CEO of IANA. \"His dedication and commitment to intermodalism has made him a strong advocate for our association.\"\nA two-term IANA Board of Directors member, Gooden's commitment to expanding CSX's service offerings and improving customer engagement has made CSX a leader in the intermodal industry. He made significant contributions to CSX Intermodal during his time there from 1981 to 1993, before returning to the group as president from 2001 to 2002.\nUnder Gooden's leadership, CSX Intermodal progressed the integration of long-term strategy, capital investment and continuous customer engagement. CSX and Union Pacific piloted the UMAX domestic interline container service, one of the many examples of his focus on broadening collaborative relationships in a business where more than half of the traffic travels over two or more railroads. He also facilitated investment into key capacity expansion projects, including the company's Northwest Ohio Intermodal Terminal, which reduces cross country transit times and increases reliability of the CSX network.\n\"With more people demanding more goods around the world, intermodal will continue to be crucial for the future of the global supply chain, and I am honored to help lead a company that is shaping that future,\" Gooden said.\nGooden currently serves with several other industry and community organizations, including the National Freight Transportation Association, the TTX Corporation, the Jacksonville Museum of Modern Art and the National Association of Manufacturers. He is also a member of the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank's Trade and Transportation Advisory Council.\nInitiated in 1977, the Silver Kingpin Award is given to individuals who have made significant long-term contributions to the intermodal freight industry. Gooden received the award on September 21 at this year's IANA Intermodal EXPO, located at the Greater Fort Lauderdale / Broward County Convention Center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida .\nAbout CSX\nCSX, based in Jacksonville, Florida , is a premier transportation company.
