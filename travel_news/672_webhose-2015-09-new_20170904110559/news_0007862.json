Three Design Hotels™ members are easing the transition from hedonistic travels to family adventures, combining stylish design with enough family-friendly facilities to enthrall even the most tempestuous of tots.\nSet amidst eight acres of garden overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, Almyra has been a firm favorite for chic family retreats for over a decade, and with good reason. The family-run 189-room resort offers the holy trinity for parents: guaranteed sunshine, bulletproof childcare, and an award-winning spa to massage away the stress of toddler tantrums and teenage meltdowns. Parental time-out comes courtesy of the kids’ clubs and adventure outposts for children aged from 4 months – 14 years, while more active families will appreciate Almyra’s bike station and the two fresh water pools. Throw in creative children’s menus, kiddie concierge, and even a pre-order service for all the baby paraphernalia you could possibly need, and you have the ultimate family vacation all wrapped up.\nBack to nature takes on a whole new meaning at Pedras Salgadas Spa & Nature Park, where 12 eco-houses and two treehouses blend seamlessly into the lush greenery of a centuries old park in northern Portugal. An innovative family activity program focuses on the natural bounty of the hotel’s spectacular surroundings, and days packed with treasure hunts, mountain biking, horse riding, nature trails and tree climbing are certain to convert even the most committed tech-head. In each of the guest houses, floor to ceiling windows and wood-lined private decks bring the outdoors inside and create a feeling of camping – albeit in the chicest way possible.\nLocated adjacent to the base station at Laax-Murschetg, the 112-room rocksresort is Europe’s only fully integrated ski resort, making it the ideal introduction to skiing en famille. The complex of architecturally minimalist cube-shaped buildings houses furnished holiday apartments, shops, restaurants and bars – all arranged around a central square. The region, known by locals as Flims during the summer months, is a year-round destination. The nearby UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Sardona Tectonic Arena offers 250km of breathtaking hiking trails, including buggy-proof and themed routes designed for young families. The rocky landscape for which the hotel is named offers world-class rock climbing and mountain biking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T19:53:08.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
