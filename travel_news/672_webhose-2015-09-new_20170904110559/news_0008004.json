This may offer an opportunity for Blade to reach new consumers, as they turn to its air travel for the first time to navigate New York on a crowded day. \nGridlock alert Blade used an email to newsletter subscribers and social media to alert its followers of the offer. \nPlanes operated by Liberty Helicopters and Zip Aviation will take off from helipads at the Blade Lounge on 30th Street near the West Side Highway and at the Blade Lounge at 34th Street and the FDR Drive. Blade will operate the five- to eight-minute flights from 7:45 a.m. through 10 a.m., and then again from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. \nConsumers can book a flight through the Blade mobile application for a fixed price of $95. \nSince there are heightened safety concerns, with the pope, President Barack Obama and the delegates of the United Nations all in the city at the same time, Blade will have a TSA officer present at each helipad to screen passengers before boarding. No bags besides purses or briefcases will be allowed, and alcohol will be prohibited. \nPope Francis \nBlade’s business model is based around avoiding roadway congestion. Fly Blade, a new high-end transportation service launched in 2014, takes the stress out of traveling to the Hamptons by chartering helicopters from New York to Long Island’s east end. With congested roadways and limited train seats available, affluent consumers looking for a quick weekend getaway do not want to sit in Friday afternoon traffic. Fly Blade is designed to save consumers time and aggravation by creating any easy way to book travel plans to and from the Hamptons ( see story ). \nThe charter also rolled out expanded service for the holiday season, getting travelers to Teterboro Airport in a speedy fashion ( see story ).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T11:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T11:22:15.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
