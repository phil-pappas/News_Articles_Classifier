But the city is thriving, and it offers travelers an abundance of options to fill up a visit: Museums and art galleries line the streets, the restaurant scene is booming, and there's a collection of monuments and memorials that are comparable to those found in Washington, D.C. It's also worth noting that that their airport (the first international airport designed and built after 9/11) has been named the best airport in North America every year since 2012. Downtown you'll find lots of activities at Lucas Oil Stadium, the Indiana Convention Center and the Circle Centre Mall.
