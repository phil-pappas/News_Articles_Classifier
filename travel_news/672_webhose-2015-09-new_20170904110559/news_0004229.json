Coming out of college as an undersized scrambling quarterback he found his way onto the New England Patriots roster as a scrappy receiver and special teams player. With a lot of grit, determination and the right opportunities, he is now Tom Brady's go to guy and a star in the NFL. David Rosenberg isn't your typical car dealer either. Although he grew up in the business like most of his counterparts, he also went to Colby College and got his Ivy League MBA from Columbia University in New York . By the time he was in his early 40's he had already grown his families dealerships, taken them public and after a successful exit left to start Prime Motor Group which itself has grown into one of the biggest as most respected dealer groups in the country.\nA couple years ago Rosenberg and Edelman met and formed an instant friendship. Such good friends that Julian has even been to Rosenberg's house for dinner during the Jewish high holidays. So when the inevitable occurred and they discussed using Julian to help promote Prime Motor Group it came as no surprise that the two decided to take an outside of the box approach. \"What Julian has accomplished in social media with his YouTube channel is really impressive. Almost every video he makes gets over 1 million views. It was a no brainer to start with social/viral content when it came to promoting our stores with him\" said Rosenberg.\nEdelman has made a splash online with his comical Youtube videos . For his first foray into the car business you can see Julian take his first shot at selling cars in a mockumentary styled video that will remind a lot of viewers of the hit show The Office . According to Edelman, \"It was a fun project. I was basically my version of the 'Michael Scott' of car salesman, which is a total contrast to the way David runs his stores. I am definitely looking forward to doing more projects with Prime in the future.\"\nPrime Motor Group -\nPrime Motor Group is owned and operated by David Rosenberg and Matt McGovern and is comprised of 25 locations in Massachussetts, Cape Cod , Southern New Hampshire and Southern Maine . Prime Motor Group sells new and used vehicles, and it represents 20 different new vehicle brands. Information on all of Prime's locations and inventory can be found online at www.driveprime.com . Two years ago Prime Motor Group launched a new, more transparent sales process that gives their customers access to real market data to make buying a car faster and more enjoyable. The group's tagline is \"A New Kind of Car Buying Experience.\" Also note that David Rosenberg's father, Ira Rosenberg , is still actively involved in running the group's Maine operation and has acted as their beloved spokesperson in that market for almost a decade now. Prime Motor Group is one of the largest and fastest growing car dealership groups in the country.\nJulian Edelman -\nJulian Edelman is an American football wide receiver and punt returner for the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Kent State and the College of San Mateo as a quarterback, and he was drafted by the Patriots in the seventh round of the 2009 NFL Draft.\nEdelman is notable for his versatility, having played both wide receiver and cornerback in 2011, and for his punt returns. He holds the Patriots franchise record for longest punt return and the most punts returned for touchdowns; and, as of the start of the 2013 NFL season, the highest career punt return average among active players.
