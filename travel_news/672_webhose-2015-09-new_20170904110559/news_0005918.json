It will feature daily service to/from Grenada and Barbados where flights will connect to Caribbean Airlines’ flight bank at Piarco International Airport, Trinidad to various destinations throughout the Caribbean Airlines network, including Miami, New York, Toronto, Jamaica, Guyana and the Bahamas.\nCaribbean Airlines CEO Michael DiLollo is also pleased that the airline is on a path to better serve its valued customers.\nHe commented: “Our new fall schedule is built for easy connectivity to destinations within and outside the Caribbean region. The timing of the services from Barbados and Grenada to/from Piarco, Trinidad with connections throughout our network, are ideal for business and leisure travellers. The schedule gives our valued customers an early start, late evening returns and easy connections in Piarco with “walk off and walk on” service soon to be implemented similar to the service provided to our Guyana passengers. It means that our customers’ precious time can be put to the best use.”\nMr. DiLollo continued, “CAL is in the exclusive position of having hubs in the southern Caribbean in Trinidad and Tobago and in the northern Caribbean in Jamaica. In this way, it is uniquely positioned to provide visitors to and citizens of the region with many travel options.”\nCaribbean Airlines provides a value-added product to its customers: passengers’ first checked bag flies free, frequent flyer miles, free meals, free headsets for movies and a full on-board service reflecting the warmth of the islands.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T01:25:54.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
