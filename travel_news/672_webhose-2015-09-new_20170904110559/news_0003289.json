Dubai Welcomes Newest Edition 1 together with Ian Schrager and Dubai Properties, today announced plans for a second EDITION hotel in the United Arab Emirates set for Dubai. Scheduled to open in 2018, the new hotel will follow the expected 2016 debut of the Emirate’s first EDITION property located in Abu Dhabi. EDITION, the first true luxury-lifestyle brand, combines the personal, intimate, individualized and unique hotel experience that Ian Schrager is known for, with the global reach, operational expertise and scale of Marriott International. Marriott International will manage the hotel under a long-term agreement.\nThe 258-room hotel will occupy a strategic beach front location on Jumeirah Beach Residence (JBR), providing easy access to leisure, retail, and entertainment and dining outlets on the 1.7 km-long promenade – The Walk at JBR, also developed by Dubai Properties. Expected to open in the first quarter of 2018, the new hotel will boast of multiple food and beverage outlets as well as business and leisure facilities including a spa, a beach club, meeting and special event space and a fully equipped business center. When opened, the project is poised to join the growing portfolio of Dubai Properties offerings within the hospitality sector.\n“Dubai remains one of the most important and vibrant destinations in the world, where we are delighted to announce our second EDITION hotel to open in the Middle East,” said Alex Kyriakidis, president for Marriott International in the Middle East and Africa. “Following the iconic openings of London, Miami Beach and New York City, we couldn’t be more excited about the potential for this brand in the region,” said Mr. Kyriakidis. “Dubai Properties is an ideal partner for a project of this magnitude and we are thrilled to be working together,” said Mr. Kyriakidis.\nAbdullatif AlMulla, Group CEO of Dubai Properties Group, said: “Dubai Properties has long focused on introducing leading international hotel brands to JBR to attract global visitors as part of Dubai’s vision to boost tourism. The launch of Marriott International’s EDITION allows us to introduce a premium beachfront boutique hotel experience to JBR, further expanding the choice of options for travelers. EDITION is designed to appeal to discerning travelers looking for a vibrant, luxurious setting for their stay and we are confident it will appeal to visitors from all parts of the world, as well as local residents.”\nIan Schrager, chairman and chief executive officer of Ian Schrager Company, commented, “I am thrilled to continue the global expansion of the new EDITION lifestyle brand with this exciting project in Dubai. Following the opening of our Abu Dhabi hotel, the EDITION brand is on track to have a robust presence in the Emirates.”\nNow open in New York, London, Miami and Istanbul, EDITION Hotels has marked the next chapter in the lifestyle hotel story. This delicate balancing act encompasses, for the very first time, not only great design and true innovation, but also great personal, friendly, modern service as well as outstanding, one-of-a-kind food, beverage and entertainment offerings “all under one roof”. The authenticity and originality that Ian Schrager brings to this new brand coupled with the global reach of Marriott International results in a truly distinct product that sets itself apart from anything else currently in the marketplace.\nEach hotel with its rare individuality, authenticity, originality and unique ethos reflects the best of the cultural and social milieu of its location and of the time. Although all of the hotels look completely\ndifferent from each other, the brand’s unifying aesthetic is in its approach and attitude to the modern lifestyle rather than its appearance. EDITION is about an attitude and the way it makes you feel rather than the way it looks. Sophisticated public spaces, finishes, design and details serve the experience, not drive it.\nFuture EDITION hotels are planned for Abu Dhabi (2016), Sanya, China (2016), Bangkok (2016), Times Square (2018), West Hollywood (2018), Reykjavik, Iceland (2018), Wuhan, China (2019), and Bali, Indonesia (2019).\nSource:- Marriott", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T04:13:25.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
