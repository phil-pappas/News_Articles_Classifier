Kids learn about the great outdoors, interesting plants and native animals that are ever present in our amazing environment.\nJunior Rangers learn through a special program by visiting parks, picking-up animals, meeting with park Rangers and gaining information from scientists.\nCommunity Engagement Rangers deliver the program with the assistance of staff in Parks and Wildlife. Junior Ranger Programs exist and are growing in Darwin, Katherine and Alice Springs.\n“Tonight I put a call out to Territory kids to get involved and participate in the junior ranger program and you could find yourself investigating water bugs, spotlighting nocturnal wildlife, spying on birds with binoculars and exploring Indigenous culture,” Mrs Price said.\n“The insight gained into Parks and Wildlife could inspire these junior rangers to a career in wildlife/land care and if they move into other career areas they will have obtained knowledge and skills from their time as rangers that will last a lifetime.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T14:22:49.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
