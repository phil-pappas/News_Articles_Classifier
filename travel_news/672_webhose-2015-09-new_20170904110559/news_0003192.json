Considered one of the largest street events in New York City, the festival is also the largest Brazilian cultural event outside of Brazil.\nThis year, Delta invited its Brazilian partner airline GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes to join it in supporting Brazilian Day, but the airline didn’t stop there. Delta also reached out to the New York Mets, successfully securing the baseball team’s sponsorship for the event as well.\n“We are proud to sponsor such an important event for the Brazilian community in the U.S.,” said Hector Ruiz, regional sales manager – U.S. and Latin America. “Not only has it given us an opportunity to strengthen our ties with the community and Brazil, which is our fourth largest global market, but it has also given us a wonderful opportunity to work hand-in-hand with GOL, allowing us to continue to deepen Delta’s relationship with our strategic Brazilian partner.”\nBrazil has a vibrant community living in New York City, so naturally Delta maintains a number of U.S.-Brazil routes to help community members easily visit their families; businesspeople to travel quickly; and potential tourists who would like to enjoy each country’s attractions.\nDelta operates flights between four U.S. cities (Atlanta, Detroit, New York City and Orlando, starting in December) and three Brazil destinations (Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo). Furthermore, through its strategic alliance with GOL, Delta meets 99 percent of domestic demand to locations throughout Brazil – more than any other U.S. airline.\nAs the event’s official sponsor, Delta and GOL logos could be found all over the festival, from T-shirts to backdrops to media efforts. Delta employees from the Sales, Latin Unit Sales and Specialty Sales teams came together to host a company booth.\nSource:- Delta Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T04:19:29.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
