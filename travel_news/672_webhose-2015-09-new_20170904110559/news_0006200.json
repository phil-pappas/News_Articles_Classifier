() \n\nMIAMI — After 25 years of ranking beaches, the professor known as “Dr. Beach” is starting his list of best beaches over from scratch in 2016. And he’ll be giving extra credit to beaches that ban smoking. \nProfessor Stephen Leatherman of Florida International University began his best beaches list in 1991. Once a beach achieved the No. 1 ranking, it was retired from consideration on future lists. \nBut now he says he’ll start fresh next year so that even beaches that he previously rated as tops have a shot at the No. 1 slot again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T19:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-07T13:42:30.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
