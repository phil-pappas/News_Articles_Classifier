We have the synergy between the public and private sector and locals to make the Spetses event bigger and better each year.\"\nRobert Karalis, organizer of the first island race in Syros, says he welcomed 120 participants earlier this month.\n\"Numbers will come. We think success comes from putting it together. In the end, we connect the small island communities to a new concept of tourism in Greece. They love to participate, volunteer and cheer on the runners. It's a very local experience and a different feeling from the city races.\"\n\"Greece should invest heavily in sport tourism, especially in the islands,\" says Maria Michalopoulou who is co-organizing the upcoming Serifos Sunset Race.\n\"Islands like Serifos, for example, are marked with historic, even ancient, hiking trails and paths perfect for adventurous sporty tourists to discover. Developing island race tourism is at the starting line, and we believe the possibilities are infinite.\"\nHere are the top Greek island competitions to watch out for:\nSerifos Sunset Race\nOn one of the last weekends of the summer, as the warm sun sets over the Aegean Sea, runners will be appreciating the view from a route bordering the island's rocky landscape, untouched bays and wild beaches -- an EU Natura 2000 protected site.\nNow in its third year, the event has expanded to include swimming races. There's also a children's race.\n\"Despite rescheduling our race due to the snap elections, we hope to get 200 participants, which is four times the turnout from the first year,\" says co-organizer Maria Michalopoulou.\nwww.serifosrace.com ; September 27-29, 2015\nKefalonia Two Capital Challenge\nNow in its second year, the Kefalonia Two Capital Challenge Race takes runners along a 32-kilometer stretch that curves around the Ionian island's central bay.\nThe route starts in the city's capital of Argostoli and ends in the main square of the second largest city of Lixouri.

The support is tremendous,\" says founder Marina Coutarelli.\nwww.spetsesmarathon.com ; November 9-11, 2015\nHydra's Trail Event\nHydra's traffic-free (vehicles are forbidden) and mountainous landscape is the preferred destination for Greece's trail runners.\nAt Hydra's Trail Event, athletes can compete in a long-distance 25.6-kilometer race that heads up Hydra's tallest peak, Eros, which reaches 590 meters.\nHydra's Trail also organizes a 7.5-kilometer race, a 3.9-kilometer downhill race and children's races.\nwww.hydrastrail.gr ; next event: April 2016\nLefkada Green Half Marathon\nThe flat scenic route of Lefkada's annual Green Half Marathon is ideal for long-distance runners seeking a new personal best.\nThe route includes a 17-kilometer stretch through the Lagoon of Lefkada, an E.U. protected Natura 2000 site.\nIt also runs past the island's award-winning beaches including Porto Katsiki, Egremni and Kathisma.\nAlso popular are the children's race and five- and 10-kilometer races.\nwww.greenhalfmarathon.gr ; next event: May 2016\nSyros City Trail Race\nThe Syros City Trail Race gives competitors a chance to huff it up hills as well as a maze of marble stairs in the heart of Ermopouli's historic neoclassical town.\nThe 10-kilometer race consists of 3,700 steps. \"It was a big challenge!\" says co-organizer Robert Karalis.\n\"A Greek island race is designed uniquely for that island.
