The French hoteliers today leverage the technology investments made by independent technology providers and online reservation platforms, offering consumer-friendly features such as independent reviews, comparison tools, local language content, the possibility of paying in their own currency either via their phones or their computers ensure a comprehensive, easy and secure booking experience for travelers. \n\"ETTSA is also concerned that the law seems to conflict with the basic contractual and commercial freedoms of Europe and may infringe on fundamental EU principles such as the free movement of services and EU competition law,\" said Mr Klenner. \n\"The law seems to be discriminatory, unjustified and imposes obstacles to market access in France. This is particularly unwelcome at a time when the European Commission is seeking to create a truly pan-European marketplace for online services,\" Mr Klenner concluded.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T21:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T23:15:31.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
