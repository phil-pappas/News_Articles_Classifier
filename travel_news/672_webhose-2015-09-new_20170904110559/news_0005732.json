This service represents the first time that Staten Islanders have had a mass transit connection directly to Newark Airport. The new service, the TAZ 100, provides 14 round trips per day from the following three points on Staten Island: \nRoute 100 Bus Stop Mass transit connections \nHuguenot SIR Station Staten Island Railway, X17, X19, X23, X24 \nOuterbridge Park & Ride X17, X22 \nWest Shore Expressway â€“ Victory Boulevard S62, S92, X11, X19, X22 \nFree parking is also available at the Outerbridge Park & Ride, conveniently located at the south end of the Korean War Veterans Parkway and the West Shore Expressway. \nThe Route 100 service fills a critical need for Staten Island residents. The Port Authority's annual profile of departing passengers indicates that 1.4% of Newark Airport users originate in Staten Island, representing a market size of almost 500,000 passengers per year. A larger number of Staten Islanders used both LGA (1.9%) and JFK (1.5%) than Newark in 2014. It is likely that with this new service, Newark will become the airport of choice for Staten Island.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T04:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T07:24:26.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
