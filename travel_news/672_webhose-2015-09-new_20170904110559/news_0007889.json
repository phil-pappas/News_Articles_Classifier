Once they reach the farm, participants will take a 20-minute boat ride to the area in the water where they are harvested and learn about the different varieties.\nAn oyster lunch back in the city follows the visit. Mr. Pryor and his team will serve a five-course menu with dishes like roasted halibut in an oyster saffron sauce. The food will be paired with cocktails like mimosas as well as wine.\nThe restaurant plans to introduce more trips to Sexton Oysters based on interest.\nIn Transit Travel news, deals and tips, written by the editors and reporters of the Travel section.
