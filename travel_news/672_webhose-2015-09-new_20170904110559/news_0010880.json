Miller\nAUSTIN, Texas , Sept. 2, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Mark Miller announced today that he is seeking the Libertarian Party of Texas' nomination for Texas Railroad Commissioner in 2016.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150901/263055\nDr. Miller was the 2014 Libertarian nominee for Texas Railroad Commissioner and is again running for office because he believes it is imperative for the Texas Railroad Commission to serve all Texans, not just the oil and gas industry.\n\"As Commissioner, I promise to transform the agency by bringing increased transparency and accountability, a culture of simplification and regular review, and a new focus on surface property rights,\" says Miller.\nThe only other announced candidate for the post is the incumbent Commission Chairman, Mr. David Porter . \"During Commissioner Porter's tenure, the Railroad Commission was embroiled in many controversies surrounding oil and gas development in Texas ,\" notes Miller. \"Among them were appropriate regulations for wastewater wells that trigger earthquakes and eminent domain abuse by common carrier pipelines. Sadly, regulations promulgated by the Commission under Porter's watch turned out to be nothing more than window-dressing, resulting in additional bureaucratic busy-work, but with no substantive positive effects on protecting the Texas public. Even more sadly, this appears to be the usual state of affairs at the most important of state agencies.\"\nThere will be three public presentations of some of Dr. Miller's thoughts on the Railroad Commission in the Dallas/Fort Worth area September 2 â€“ 8, 2015 ( www.miller4tx.com/events ).\n\"As I look at Commissioner Porter's issues for the 2016 campaign, where are the calls to increase transparency by changing the Commission's name and eliminating openly-admitted crony capitalism?\" questions Miller. \"Where are the calls for regulatory reform that are needed for a stodgy 100+ year-old agency? And, where are the calls to better protect personal liberties by putting surface property rights on a more equal footing with mineral rights?\"\n\"I challenge all candidates for Texas Railroad Commissioner to engage in a series of serious and spirited public debates over important issues facing the Railroad Commission,\" says Miller.\nTexas Railroad Commissioner is the only State executive position on the November 2016 ballot. \" Texas voters should insist on open and robust public discussions befitting this immensely important position and befitting our great state,\" notes Miller.\nAbout Mark Miller :\nDr. Mark A.
