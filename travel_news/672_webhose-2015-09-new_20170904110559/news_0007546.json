Seriously, close your eyes and explore the apple scent and the wood scent with your sniffer. Go outside and do the same. Smell the leaves and feel the warm, dry, Minnesota fall sunshine on your neck. - Yelper Justin T Yelp Fullscreen St Croix Boat & Packet Co: www.yelp.com/biz/st-croix-boat-and-packet-co-stillwater-2 Photo: St Croix River Boat. - Bak J More reader comments: As I think back on the boat cruise what sticks out in my mind is how ALL of the staff were authentically welcoming, friendly and accommodating.

Unique to River Oasis is their haystackers, which is two eggs on top of a bed of hash browns and is loaded up with cheese and other ingredients depending on which haystackers you order. I ordered the Oasis haystacker which came with ham, bacon, sausage, green pepper, and mushrooms. I added their delicious sausage gravy which made the meal really come together. So many flavors!!

Kimberly F More reader comments: Great tour. Seriously! The tour was free and lasted maybe 1 hour and 15 minutes. Instead of the old boring talk of \"How does I make beer?\" , the tour guide Dave? talked about the history of beer, how it was used as payment, how it was used as a meal source, etc. It was awesome! As the tour went on (and I say less of a tour and more of a talk, since the space is just a walkway) we got to sample 4 of their beers. - Yelper Sarah M Yelp Fullscreen Maple Island Brewing: yelp.com/biz/maple-island-brewing-stillwater Photo: Beer flight. - Tetiana I More reader comments: Unlimited free popcorn, which I'm always a fan of, and the beer prices were extremely reasonable. $5 for a glass and $10 for a flight.
