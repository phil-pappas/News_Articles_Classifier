You won’t be sorry, even if you get a little sore walking a mile and a half.\nHyannis is tucked into the triceps of the arm of the Cape, buoyed by the warm but treacherous waters of Nantucket Sound. You’ve got beach, boats, small town, American history and seaside restaurants such as the Black Cat Tavern, where my sister and I enjoy a mug of the three-time winner of the Cape Cod Chowder Festival.\nGoing carless is therapeutic in Hyannis, the same way it’s therapeutic in Manhattan. Everybody complains about the traffic. Walking is good for you. Driving is stressful. Walking is joyful. You have time to stop and smell those big, blue hydrangeas, which you discover have no scent. You want ice cream, fried clams, Sam Adams, a boat ride at sunset, a concert on the green. It’s right here, right where you are.\nYou don’t have to find a place to park.\nAll within walking distance\nMy perfect day in the village of Hyannis in Barnstable includes a long walk to the beach, a stroll down Main Street, a quick step to the Inner Harbor and fresh seafood consumed loudly with good friends and family at an outdoor table. I might go out fishing, play golf, attend a Cape Cod Baseball League game in season, or catch A-list entertainment at the Melody Tent, where I’ve seen Ray Charles, Tony Bennett, Joe Walsh and the members of Alabama. It’s all within walking distance during a summer season that lasts from Memorial Day to Columbus Day.\nI stay in a cottage, between Main Street and the beach, within walking distance of the bus depot, which connects to Boston. The daytime temperature is usually in the 70s or 80s. Evenings can be cool enough to wear a jacket.\nThe soundtrack includes the Red Sox on the radio, sea gulls laughing and the sound of waves cleansing the beach.\nHenry David Thoreau visited Cape Cod four times between 1849 and 1857 and spent most of his time walking. “A man may stand there and put all America behind him,” he wrote. I feel the same way when I walk within the tidal zone of the beach at Hyannis Port. Here I breathe in the spirit of President John F. Kennedy, the Mayflower Pilgrims and our Founding Fathers plotting revolution. You can’t get here except on foot at low tide, leaving quiet footprints that wash away as the tide rises.\nMy sister and her husband prefer Kalmus Beach, famous for wind surfing and watching the ships roll in, island ferries, tourist boats, fishing boats and yachts.\nThe John F. Kennedy Hyannis Museum on Main Street features a photo exhibition, “Jack & Bobby: Brothers First,” which attracts older visitors, sometimes with grandchildren. Outside, JFK strides, youthful in bronze, barefoot in the sand and the Cape Cod switch grass. A self-guided walking tour, the Hyannis Kennedy Legacy Trail, winds down to the beach at Veterans Memorial Park to the Kennedy Memorial and the Korean War Memorial.\nWhen people get tired of walking, trolleys, taxis and various bus and boat rides beckon. Sis and I take the Bay Spirit Lighthouse Harbor Tour on a 63-foot powered catamaran with plenty of outdoor deck space. We see historic lighthouses, learn about shipwrecks, and cruise over near the Kennedy compound. Everyone laughs, when our guide, Holly, says, “Arnold will not be back.”\nBack at the dock, a man and his son get off a charter fishing boat carrying a cooler full of porgy. “I’ll fry about 10 tomorrow, and freeze the rest,” he says. Another group docking another boat holds up some impressive striped bass, the biggest measuring 40 inches long, weighing 22 pounds. The mate will clean them right there for an extra fee. Just down the dock, a commercial fisherman is hoisting a tub full of conchs, popular in Asia and Italy, into a refrigerator truck.\nMore than just chowder\nI used to think you could judge a Cape Cod restaurant based on the quality of the clam chowder. I’m not so sure anymore. I think it’s gotten creamier, maybe too creamy. One order of fried whole belly clams at Spanky’s Clam Shack will feed three people. Most Cape Cod seafood is fried, baked, broiled, boiled, steamed or raw. Alberto’s offers Italian. The Eclectic Cafe, romantically tucked into a back alley, serves martinis, Wellfleet oysters, butter- and herb-basted halibut, and seared sea scallops with citrus coconut gel. The Brazilian Grill roasts authentic rotisserie barbecue.\nThe Torino Restaurant and Bar, an Italian-Brazilian hybrid, is an outdoor cafe by day, a bustling happy hour with live music in the evening, and a dance club after 10 p.m. Just a few blocks down, Embargo features outdoor drinks and tapas, and also transforms into a singles and couples club at night. The other outdoor bar worth noting is the Beech Tree Cantina. The historic English weeping beech tree dates back to 1776.\nAt night, I check the tide charts. At low tide, the next morning, I’ll walk down to Keyes Beach, to the inlet, where the freshwater pond empties into the saltwater of Nantucket Sound, and watch crabs and fish move through the estuary.\nMy guide, Thoreau, once wrote, “My life is like a stroll upon the beach, as near the ocean’s edge as I can go.” Today, he might add caution, that rocks and jetties can be slippery and sharp. You can fall in, so protect your cellphone, or leave it behind.\nDon Wall is a freelance writer in Dallas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T06:44:28.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
