It had been a long time since breakfast, plus I was battling a cold and jet lag. And, I was soon to find out, it was going to be several more hours before we ate.\nBut, as we drove up the mountains and began to explore the ancient community of Safed, Israel, my grumpy mood magically — some would say mystically — disappeared.\nIt was Saturday, the Sabbath, when we arrived in Safed. Because the city of 30,000 is widely recognized as the most religiously observant in Israel, there wasn’t a car on the streets and certainly not a restaurant or cafe open anywhere.\nSafed is spelled several ways — Zefat, S’vat, Tzfat — depending on your faith or historical perspective. Many call it the Sedona of Israel. About 3,000 feet above sea level in the hills overlooking the Sea of Galilee, Safed is at the highest elevation of Israeli cities. Because of its altitude (or proximity to the heavens), Safed is considered one of the four holy cities of Israel. Many believe that God’s presence resides directly above Safed and that the Messiah will come from this northern city on his way to Jerusalem.\nWe learned these things from our guide, Amir Orly, a religious scholar versed in Christianity, Judaism and Islam who chatted softly as we walked the narrow streets and alleys of Safed’s former Arab quarter. He pointed out pockmarks in the ancient stone walls, reminders of the violence that occurred in 1948 during Israel’s War of Independence — the last time Arabs lived in this city.\nBut we felt no threat this day, only an overwhelming sense of tranquility as the city worked its magic on us, washing away my jet lag, my cold and hunger.\nThe former Arab quarter is now home to artists and their studios, many of them Jewish immigrants from Russia. We were delighted to find a few of their shops open on the Sabbath, and they waved us in with warm smiles and nodding heads.\nLeonid Zikeev has made his home here since emigrating from Russia in 1991. The language barrier prohibited much conversation as we explored his gallery, but I was drawn to the many oils, dominated by the color blue, depicting Safed and the Galilee region.\nBlue is prominent throughout Safed. Doorways of many homes and businesses are painted this color to ward off evil. The belief is that God is in heaven, heaven is in the sky, and the sky is blue, so evil will not enter through a doorway wrapped in God’s presence.\nI’m not sure a paint color controls good and evil, but maybe the little blue ornament I purchased in Safed, now hanging in my office, will indeed work its magic here, just as the city worked its magic on me.\nDiana Lambdin Meyer is a freelance writer based in Parkville, Mo.\nWhen you go Israeli Ministry of Tourism, goisrael.com\nSafed Tourism, www.safed.co.il\nZikeev Art Gallery, zikeev.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T03:51:08.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
