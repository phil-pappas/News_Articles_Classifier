Domestikator. Pic: Twitter/@AtelierLieshout Source: Supplied \nTALK about erecting a controversial building. This German hotel takes hardened structures to a whole new level of wrong. \nFor those of you who, erm, really get into your architecture, this installation is part of the annual Ruhrtriennale Festival in Bochum, Germany. \nYou might think it’s just an excuse for a bunch of creative types to pop up a building that looks like two people having sex in public, but apparently there’s something much more deep, meaningful and sincere to it. \nThe building, dubbed ‘Domestikator’ is supposed to arouse your thoughts about man’s impact on his environment. \nThe creators behind the installation started working their tools in 2014 according to Metro.co.uk looking for “deeper layers beneath the provocative design of the artwork”. ....Germany. The structure titled “Domestikator,” was part of an exhibit called, “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.” pic.twitter.com/dlbIrokCOx — Jhawn Paul (@PinkSheepNews) August 28, 2015 @ModernToss \"sorted!\" Sneakpreview #Ruhrtriennale #Domestikator , part of TGTBTU, largest installation ever by AVL... pic.twitter.com/yoYShLYOL8 ” — Graeme Burns (@burnsiemcside) August 23, 2015 \nAccording to designboom.com “the towering figures serve as a symbol for the power of humanity, paying homage to the ingenuity and capacity of humans, but the eventual use of this power to dominate and domesticate the natural environment”. \nNo-one knows for sure if the square boxes at the front of the installation are representative of a human. \nWe’ll leave that up to you to have deep and reflective thoughts about. \nHowever, the building does actually have some use, other than visual comedy: It re-purposes as a hotel for VIPs at the Ruhrtriennale Festival. \nPart of a series called The Good, The Bad And The Ugly it will be on display until September 26. \nRookje Meijerink of Atelier Van Lieshout , the art agency behind building going up told Metro.co.uk that German locals had warmed to curious and intimate building and found it all “pretty funny”. \n“The artwork pays tribute to the ingenuity, the sophistication and the capacities of humankind, to the power of organisation, and to the use of this power to dominate, domesticate the natural environment.” \nThankfully it’s not a moving piece. \nFollow Sherine on Twitter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T06:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T08:36:42.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
