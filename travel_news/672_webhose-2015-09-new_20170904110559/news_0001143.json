A330. If they would be that keen to keep their business identical across all fleet, then they will change A340 ages ago. IMHO they plan rid off A340 in favor of A350. And perhaps they keep existing layout on A330 because it a bit narrower thet A350 and new layout does not fit.\n0 report reply 3 2 hours, 22 minutes ago by kovsky Air Canada has 3 types, AA, vietnam airlines, JAL, thai airways, Delta etc. do as well.
