The deadline to submit applications is October 16, 2015, and there is no entry fee to submit applications.\nThis new award programme, supported by EU-SWITCH-Asia RPSC (Regional Policy Support Component), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and PATA, identifies and commends excellence in sustainable tourism by granting awards to travel and tourism organisations that demonstrate outstanding practices and performance within the three pillars of sustainability. Award criteria were developed based upon sustainable consumption and production principles and existing, internationally recognised sustainable tourism standards such those developed by the Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC), and by the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).\nPATA CEO Mario Hardy said, “This is an exciting joint initiative, which celebrates best practices in tourism by recognising those organisations that demonstrate leadership in sustainable tourism. It is a wonderful opportunity for the Asian tourism industry to share their stories with the rest of the community, exemplifying what can be done to make a sustainable and lasting impact in our community.”\nEntries are now welcome from a broad range of travel and tourism businesses and organisations in the 19 designated countries (see list below). The awards categories cover accommodation providers, tour operators, destinations, and community-based tourism initiatives.\nWinners are offered increased visibility and acknowledgement of their outstanding sustainable tourism performance. Specifically, winners will receive public recognition at the highest level in the region, and attain acknowledgement for their vision for sustainability, expertise, and innovative work. Winners in each category will be sponsored to attend the awards presentation ceremony in Legazpi, Albay, Philippines as part of the programme for the PATA New Tourism Frontiers Forum 2015 on Friday, November 27. Winners will also receive an impressive selection of other benefits including use of award winner logo, listing in the winners showcase e-booklet, and worldwide media exposure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:07:08.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
