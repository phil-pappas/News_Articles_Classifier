Dip into Britain’s hip neighbourhoods and you’ll find funky footwear, quirky trends and retro clothing to buy that will see you climb up the cool-ometer!\nThe hip shopping neighbourhoods\nLondon is, of course, a major shopping destination with something for everyone – especially those who yearn for the cool and the cutting-edge. Many visitors to England’s capital are lured by the cobbled charm of Covent Garden piazza and central market, but trendy young shoppers prefer to delve into Covent Garden’s buzzing little streets. Neal Street is home to youthful fashion brands from around the world including Diesel, Miss Sixty, American Apparel and Franklin & Marshall, plus cool footwear brands Dr. Martens, Camper, Vans, and Havaianas. Floral Street is more grown-up, with flagship stores of Britain’s Paul Smith and Ted Baker, Orlebar Brown tailored beachwear, and bags and accessories from Mulberry and Radley. The streets radiating from Seven Dials are also worthy of exploration, to discover shops such as quirky British jewellers Tatty Devine, vintage style from Pop Boutique, provocative lingerie from Coco de Mer, and sporty urban brands such as Fred Perry, Superdry, Carhartt and Le Coq Sportif.\nLondon’s hipster heartland is east of the centre, focused around the Shoreditch and Spitalfields neighbourhoods, where what’s cool is derived from the gritty streets themselves. Be inspired by street style by observing what others are wearing, then kit yourself out accordingly. Vintage fashion is a major trend, although the style barometer can swing anywhere from the 1920s to the 1990s.\nVintage specialists on and around Brick Lane and Hanbury Street include Blitz London, Rokit, Absolute Vintage and Blondie Vintage – popular with local hipsters, students and fashion stylists, they’re treasure troves of retro, sustainable style. A former brewery off Brick Lane, Old Truman Brewery now houses cool shops such as Rough Trade East Records, plus independent fashion stores YMC, Traffic People, and denim specialist Son Of A Stag. The various old warehouse spaces also host regular fashion markets and sample sales. One of numerous fashion brands with headquarters here in east London, AllSaints has a huge flagship store on Commercial Street.\nSource:- Visit Britain", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T06:27:41.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
