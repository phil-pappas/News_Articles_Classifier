The 70-plus tourism ministers present, all rejoiced at the prospect that aviation was being discussed with tourism as its needed partner. Richard Quest of CNN started off by saying that aviation and tourism must be ballroom dancing together, and not one doing the foxtrot and the second one the tango. \"It is evident to all that they should be on the same page, because with no aviation there is no visitors for the tourism destination, and with no tourism there are no passengers for the planes. It is today impossible for anyone to say that this is not my problem, because unless tourism and aviation are on the same page, 1 + 1 will never equal 3, but will remain 2 even though every tourism destination needs to see the extra benefits of their actions,\" Richard Quest said. \nOther speakers said that ministries wedded to restrictive mode and tariff practices were affecting both their tourism destination and also their airline. \"National airlines’ interests cannot any longer hamper national interests\" - it was spelled out from a packed assembly hall when explanations were given about countries investing millions to promote themselves as a tourism destination but were faced with air policies that did not favor liberalization of their air policy and, therefore, their marketing and promotional budgets were not delivering fully for their country. \nDr. Elijah Chingosho, the Secretary General of AFRAA (African Airlines Association), said that taxes in Africa for travel was the highest in the world and that this needed to be understood by ministers, as countries were preparing to introduce a full Open Sky policy by 2017 or face the consequences of being left behind. Delegates debated on the question of one's ministry mandate to continue to protect their national airline, forgetting that the protection of airlines is achieved by opening the skies. \nDavid Scowsill, the President and CEO of the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), said that he wanted to congratulate the UNWTO and ICAO for joining forces to focus on the importance of aviation and tourism working together, to maximize growth, create jobs, and foster sustainable development. \n\"Some of you will know that before joining WTTC, I spent nearly 20 years in the airline business, with British Airways; American Airlines; and easyJet, the European low-cost airline. This background in aviation has given me an insight into the fundamental dependency between airlines and tourism, the role business and leisure travel plays in sustaining and driving aviation development, and what needs to be done to maximize the relationship between the two. Aviation is part of travel and tourism. The two industries are inextricably linked and mutually dependent. \n“It is worth dwelling briefly on the sheer economic significance of this industry. \n“Travel and tourism accounts for 10% of the world’s GDP or $7.6 trillion, providing 277 million, or 1 in 11, jobs on the planet. If our industry were a country, its direct GDP contribution would rank as the 7th largest economy in the world, behind France and ahead of Brazil. \n“The sheer scale of travel and tourism and the contribution of aviation to the overall sector supports one simple fact: it is imperative that the world’s economies facilitate the growth and harness the economic power of the airline industry. \n“Get aviation ‘right’ and you are liberating your economy to provide long-term economic growth. Get it ‘wrong’ and you could be condemning your economy to decades of stagnation. \n“So, what does getting it ‘right’ mean? \n“Aviation is one of the most protected industries in the world. \n“The Chicago Convention of 1947 created the bi-lateral agreement process and rules on state ownership of airlines, which still govern the industry 7 decades later. \n“In order to circumvent the rules of the Convention, airlines have created anti-consumer structures such as global alliances, joint ventures, and code shares. I speak here with the experience of negotiating major joint venture deals between airlines, specifically to work around outdated and irrelevant bilateral agreements. I speak here as a normal traveler frustrated with code share arrangements, who still cannot work out which airline he is really flying on or which terminal he should be checking in at. \n“Countries and regions which have liberalized aviation, starting with the US in the early 1970s, have seen the economic growth which comes with a more liberal approach. Open Skies in Europe has had a beneficial impact for consumers, as low-cost carriers such as EasyJet and Ryanair have flourished, connecting not just primary cities, but also secondary cities. This has led to an influx of leisure and business travelers providing economic stimulus to cities which previously had no air connectivity. Starting originally with Southwest Airlines in the US, this model has been replicated throughout Asia and Latin America. \n“Protectionism still plays a huge part in aviation, which ultimately stifles economic development and job creation. The dispute between the US Carriers and Gulf States about the growth of Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar Airways is a case in point. The US has benefited for decades from its Open Skies approach, yet this policy is now being questioned as the US carriers come under commercial pressure. It would be catastrophic for global aviation, if the US moved away from the Open Skies agreements that it has enjoyed for so long. \n“Many economies in Asia, Africa, and Latin American have been slow to move from their protected nationalized systems or to even consider Open Skies opportunities. Tourism and commerce ministers responsible for growth of travel and tourism are constantly doing battle with their transportation colleagues, whose mandate is typically to restrain demand to protect the national flag carrier. \n“So what is to be done? \n“Governments need a clear policy on aviation which is led by the prime minister or president, whose office can resolve conflicts between tourism/commerce and the transportation or interior ministries. This aviation policy would set the framework for ministerial decisions, and provide clarity and security for operating airlines to invest in the future. \n“Private sector chief executives have to resolve departmental differences to create a long-term, sustainable future for their companies. Presidents and prime ministers have to do the same, to create a focused decision-making capability in their government and to forge clear, transparent policies for aviation. \n“Speaking on behalf of the Global Travel Association Coalition, which alongside UNWTO and WTTC includes ACI [Airports Council International], CLIA [Cruise Line International Association], ICAO, IATA [International Air Transport Association], PATA [Pacific Asia Travel Association], and WEF [World Economic Forum], we speak clearly and objectively to heads of state on the need for their direct involvement in our industry. In every meeting with a president or prime minister, and there have been 77 such meetings in the last 4 years, we make the same important points that I am making to you today. \n“Our message is always that achieving the potential of their travel and tourism sector must be of paramount importance. Liberalizing aviation is a key part of that. The role of aviation in creating jobs and driving economic growth is too important to be ignored, particularly when restrained by one ministry’s mandate to protect the national airline. It cannot make financial sense for a country to protect one or 2 companies at the expense of the economic growth of an entire industry. \n“Travel and tourism generates economic growth, jobs, and investment. Aviation liberalization creates more routes, greater competition, and lower fares. \n“As we head towards 2 billion international passengers crossing international borders by 2030, we must work together to drive our mutual growth agenda forward, in a way which balances the needs of people, planet, and profit,\" said David Scowsill of WTTC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T08:03:05.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
