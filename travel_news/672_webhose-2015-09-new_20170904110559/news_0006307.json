Tourism Ireland’s short, fast-paced film was produced to coincide with ID2015, highlighting the Wild Atlantic Way to potential visitors and urging people around the world to come and be “inspired by the rugged nature of Ireland’s Wild Atlantic Way and the people and makers behind it”.\nIt features wonderful images of the West of Ireland and includes Canteen in Limerick, jeweller Julie Connellan in Oranmore, Living Ginger Designs in Ougherard, The Tweed Project in Galway, Mescan Brewery in Westport, the Burren Perfumery, Superfolk in Westport and the Dillisk seaside food project in Connemara. Tourism Ireland is highlighting the year-long ID2015 programme, our creativity and design in its promotions around the globe throughout 2015 – celebrating design in just about every form, including events across the island, as well as activities and showcases at design weeks and fashion weeks.\nNiall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland, said: “In this year of Irish design, ID2015, we are delighted to unveil our latest online film, showcasing the Wild Atlantic Way and its superb design creativity, whetting people’s appetites to come and visit the western seaboard. We are inviting them to come and discover the creativity in this part of Ireland, local craft and style in context and perhaps take home a bit of Irish creativity.” ‘The Nature of Design – The Wild Atlantic Way’ film will be promoted on Tourism Ireland’s website, Ireland.com, which has attracted more than 16 million visitors so far this year. Tourism Ireland is also sharing the film on social media – with its Facebook fans (3+ million fans worldwide) and Twitter followers (300,000+), and on its YouTube channel.\nSource:-Tourism Ireland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T20:11:25.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
