Todd Arthur, Managing Director of HRS Singapore explained, “CTW Asia- Pacific offers a unique opportunity to increase our brand awareness, and the ability to directly engage top corporate professionals to showcase our best-in-class hotel solutions through our sponsorship.”\nAs the global leading hotel solutions provider, HRS understands that with the shift in dynamics of the global business travel industry towards Asia-Pacific, and the maturing of the corporate travel market in the region, demand from both corporates and travellers alike increases pressure on suppliers, especially accommodation providers.\n“Accommodation forms a large part of a traveller’s expenditure, yet it remains widely unmanaged across the region. Today, most companies in the region have limited visibility of the hotel category except through expense data, which does not allow for compliance, duty of care or budget tracking prior to the expenditure taking place,” shared Todd.In answer to this greater need for sophistication to manage corporate travel spend, HRS offers over 290,000 business hotels available globally in a single portal, coupled with a variety of innovative, free-of-charge tools that cover the whole value-add chain of the hotel bookingprocess and provide valuable hotel attachment, negotiated rates and clear visibility. According to HRS, their solution allows corporates to better manage the accommodation component of their travel programme in the region. As he elaborated, “HRS’ unique value proposition helps companies achieve both cost-saving goals and travellers’ satisfaction.”\nSource:-HRS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T06:04:46.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
