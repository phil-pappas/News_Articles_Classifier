Picture: AFP/BERTRAND LANGLOIS Related articles Serfontein could start for Boks against Scots Beware Scotsmen who ‘praat die taal’ Who will Bok coach pick as captain now? Boks stay focused for Scotland game In this article Companies and organisations: Springboks Topics: Rugby World Cup BREAKDOWN discipline and concentration will be key for the Springboks against Scotland in Saturday’s Pool B World Cup clash at St James’ Park, writes Craig Ray.\nThat’s according to Bok fetcher Francois Louw.\nThe respected openside flank made two steals in last weekend’s 46-6 win over Samoa, but the Boks conceded several penalties at the breakdown for not rolling away quickly enough.\nIt is an area in which Scotland pride themselves. In the past, Scot openside Alasdair Strokosch has caused headaches for the Boks and the emergence of former Highlanders flank John Hardie as a breakdown menace in tartan, has further bolstered the Scots.\n\"The breakdown will be different to what we faced last weekend,\" Louw said. \"Scotland are effective, we’ve seen it in the past. They will attack the ball and try and slow the tempo of the game.\n\"We want quick ball to get momentum, play on the front foot and play attacking rugby. That will be a big emphasis for us.\"\nWhile the Boks had analysed the opposition, for whom openside flanker Hardie had made an impact, \"it always comes back to us, and our approach to the breakdown\", Louw said.\n\"There has been a big emphasis on the tackler rolling away. Guys get into the breakdown quickly and … the tackler can get trapped in there. But refs aren’t having any of that and it’s up to you to roll away quickly. You actually have to think about where you are going to land post-tackle. It’s not just a case of getting in there and smashing a guy,\" Louw said.\n\"I’ve seen penalties awarded even when the ball is present.\"\nDiscipline would be \"a key focus because too many penalties at the breakdown could be costly\".\nAnother area where the Boks will be tested is in the scrums. Against Samoa the Boks struggled initially before gaining the upper hand. Scrum coach Pieter de Villiers is happy with the team’s progress in that respect, but he expects a tough approach from the Scotland forwards.\n\"They bring a full package,\" De Villiers said. \"Technically they are very sound in the scrum and their back five fires well, which brings a lot of power to their scrum.\n\"In the past we’ve had some serious battles against the Scots in terms of scrumming.\n\"There were positives and negatives from the scrum last week, but we ended well. In the early stages of the game we didn’t set our scrum well, so we will have to look at the technical reasons for that. But what was pleasing is that the guys adapted during the game and fixed it.\n\"We don’t have a lot of time to work on scrumming during the World Cup. We have a 20-minute session in the week and there are individual sessions with the front row, as well as video analysis.\n\"There is some front-row specific work but the bulk of the work was done before the World Cup, so it’s more about mental and physical freshness and getting our analysis of the opposition spot on.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:47:46.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
