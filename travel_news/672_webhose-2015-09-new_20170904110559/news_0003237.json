The investigation concerns whether the Board of Strategic Hotels breached their fiduciary duties to shareholders and whether Blackstone is underpaying for Strategic Hotels. The transaction may undervalue Strategic Hotels and will result in no real gain for many Strategic Hotels shareholders. For example, an analyst has set a price target for Strategic Hotels stock at $17.00 per share and Strategic Hotels stock traded at $14.06 as recently as January 19, 2015.\nIf you own shares of Strategic Hotels and wish to discuss the legal ramifications of the investigation, or have any questions, you may e-mail or call the law office of Brodsky & Smith, LLC who will, without obligation or cost to you, attempt to answer your questions.
