We both worked in a large office in South Devon, and on one particular Friday we headed off cross-country for a weekend devoted entirely to letting our hair down. We had a fantastic time and on Sunday, shortly before we were due to set off home, our friends announced they were holding a big party that evening. The lure of extended fun led us to decide that we should delay our departure for a few hours and drive home later that night. Inevitably, we stayed much longer than agreed, and when it got very late, concluded that it would probably be safer to get some sleep and drive back early the next morning; leaving ourselves an hour or so to shower and change before work. All was going swimmingly – we set off very early and enjoyed dissecting our weekend as we cruised through the near empty roads. After about an hour, I heard a loud bang – the passenger-side tyre had blown – and I quickly steered across to the hard shoulder. We noticed that the figure walking towards us was in fact our boss, Tony Mobile phones weren’t yet in circulation and with nobody to call and absolutely no basic car maintenance knowledge, we got out of the car and tried to figure out how to change the tyre. After a short while of ineffectual prodding, and a pathetic attempt to utilise the wrench, we decided to flag down a passing motorist for help. Unfortunately the road was still quiet and other drivers didn’t even seem to notice us. We began to mildly panic – it was now approaching eight o’clock. We were due to start work in an hour and still needed to get home, shower and change clothes. Luckily, a car eventually pulled up in front of us, and we stood grinning at the emerging driver, delighted at the prospect of some help. That is, until we noticed that the figure walking towards us was in fact our boss, Tony. He changed the tyre quickly, and then looking at his watch, remarked that as it was actually our work start time we should go straight to work. Protesting, we pointed out that we weren’t really dressed for the office, but he calmly reiterated that he expected us to be in work on time. Forty five minutes or so later, we strode through our quiet office, dressed in hot pants, platform boots and flimsy tops. It wasn’t the last time I went to a party on a Sunday night, but I definitely learnt a valuable lesson about timing in the process! When the unpredictable happens, the AA is there to help.
