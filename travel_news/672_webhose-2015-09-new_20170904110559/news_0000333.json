A childhood in near Sellafield, surrounded by world-class engineering and engineers. A BEng in materials science and engineering and an MSc in international construction management and engineering at the University of Leeds, and Hunt was all set for an engineering career. I soon found banking isn’t as glamorous as it’s cracked up to be... it didn't seem 'real' enough “But a lot of engineering students get tempted by financial institutions in their final year, and when I graduated I joined the share dealing department of a major bank,” he says. But the honeymoon was short-lived. “I soon found banking isn’t as glamorous as it’s cracked up to be,” he recalls. “I didn’t like being stuck behind a desk all day doing the same things. I enjoy being out on site, watching something develop and seeing it through to completion. Banking didn’t seem ‘real’ enough.” Fortunately Hunt’s story has a happy ending. After a year he quit the City and returned to his first love, engineering, joining the graduate trainee scheme at Babcock. “I wanted to work for one of the major engineering companies and Babcock had an excellent reputation,” he explains. “I knew it would support and develop me and I admired its strong health and safety ethos. You’d struggle to find an engineering support company that matches the breadth of what we do here.” After four varied placements on the graduate scheme and a year as a building services engineer, Hunt began to specialise in project management. He is now a project manager in Babcock’s Major Programmes Team (MPT), which provides consultancy expertise to other units within Babcock as well as to subcontractors and external clients. “I really enjoy the variety,” he says. “We may work on almost any aspect of engineering and any stage of a project. We might be involved in initial planning or long-term maintenance and end-of-life. We might manage the whole project lifecycle, or get called in to trouble-shoot if something’s not going well. “We get involved with supporting clients and end-users, and with commercial aspects like budgeting and contract law. It’s a great way of getting an overview of the whole business and how it works.” There’s a lot of responsibility. “Even a small contract can be worth £1million – those are the ones project managers cut their teeth on,” says Hunt. This summer he has been the lead project manager for the refurbishment of the heating and ventilation systems at an MoD-owned school in southern Italy. “I like the challenges of working internationally,” he says. “So many things are different. “The summer heat in Italy can be so intense that it becomes a health and safety issue, and the culture is very laid-back, which can be a challenge when you’re working to tight deadlines! It’s also really satisfying to see the users so happy that their building will now be properly cooled in summer and heated in winter. And my Italian is improving pretty fast.” STEM Awards 2016 Change your future.
