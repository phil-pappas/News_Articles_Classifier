Here are some ideas \nIf this is the year that you are not going over the river and through the woods to grandmother’s house for a Thanksgiving or Christmas family reunion, you and grandma can consider a Florida getaway with lodging at a condo, villa or suite resort. 8 \nPlanning for this type of trip is important, as these reunions that offer opportunities to reconnect, catch up on each other’s lives and have fun together, can also be tricky to arrange successfully: the key is to select destinations and lodgings that offer pastimes for all age groups, and just as importantly, accommodations that feature space for the family to spread out: hence, suites, and condo- or villa-style apartments and resorts. The latter goes a long way to provide privacy for members of the group who may want it on occasion –let’s face it, too much togetherness may not be good for everyone all the time. And having space may promote harmony to help prevent a negative turn of events in the state of affairs that humorist Mark Twain described thusly: “I have found out that there ain’t no surer way to find out whether you like people or hate them than to travel with them.” \nHere are some Florida resorts at some popular spots of the Sunshine State, arranged alphabetically by resort name, that you can consider for your next family getaway vacation or reunion. Consult a travel agent or log on to each resort’s website for additional details and best rates available for the dates when you wish to travel. \nBay Lake Tower at Disney’s Contemporary Resort, Orlando 0 \nDescription: A modern tower adjacent to the iconic Contemporary Resort and connected to it via a Sky Bridge, Bay Lake Tower is a Disney Vacation Club time-share property available for rental by non-members when space is available.
