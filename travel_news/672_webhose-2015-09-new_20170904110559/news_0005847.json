Not so Blackpool. A hint of autumn chill in the air heralds the Illuminations: six miles of displays strung along the prom and sometimes billed as “the other Northern Lights”. On Friday September 4, Hollywood film director Tim Burton throws the switch at this year's Switch-On to launch the Illuminations season which runs until November 8. This year’s event features Lightpool, a new “unmissable” large scale light show which will be projected on the Blackpool Tower in cycles throughout the Illuminations. Other new displays include the Strictly Come Dancing–inspired Ballroom Glitz, the vampire-themed Glampire Re-Vamped and Street to Shore from the makers of Blackpool’s graffiti festival Sand, Sea and Spray. The Illuminations are a good reason to visit a shamelessly brash and bracing resort too easily dismissed as just a stage for stag and hen nights and raucous excess. Getting there Blackpool has direct trains from Manchester and also from Preston. The quickest road route is the M55, which links the town to the M6. When to go The Switch-On – in an open-air arena opposite the Tower – is at 9.25pm, with free entertainment from 5pm. Wristbands for Friday admission have already been allocated by ballot (the ballot generally opens in the Spring) but are available for a limited time only to people buying a Saturday or a Sunday ticket (£10) for the Switch-On weekend's festival of concerts. See full details on visitblackpool.com . The weekend features a “vintage pop” music showcase, including live performances from Bananarama, Jason Donovan and Paul Young on Saturday, as well as a comedy night headlined by Al Murray – The Pub Landlord – at the Comedy Carpet on Sunday. Blackpool also hosts the World Fireworks Championships every Friday night from September 11 to October 2. What to do At the start of the season, the lights go on at 8pm, and get gradually earlier until they go on at 5pm by the end (November 8). They're lit up until some time between 10.30pm and midnight. A tram trip along the prom is a charming way to view them: a nostalgic treat for anyone who holidayed – or day-tripped – here in the Fifties, Sixties or Seventies. A walk to the end of the South Pier offers a panorama of the whole of the prom lit up like an unclasped necklace. Fish and chips, eaten on the move, are almost de rigueur . Where to stay Number One South Beach (01253 343900; numberonesouthbeach.com ), a lavishly luxurious boutique guest house on a quiet road off the prom, offers whirlpool baths, plasma screen TVs and a friendly welcome. The Big Blue (0871 222 4000; bigbluehotel.com ) may stand alongside the rollercoaster-filled Pleasure Beach (many rooms have grandstand views of it) but its style is calmer, with smart, clean lines. The seafront Imperial (01253 623971; thehotelcollection.co.uk ) is a grand, engaging reminder of Blackpool's great days hosting political party conferences. Everyone from Dickens to The Beatles has stayed. Where to eat The Beach House (01253 749899; beachhouseblackpool.co.uk ) has a prime seafront location near the Tower, and offers steak, chicken and fish dishes, plus pizzas and pasta. The town-centre Sapori (01253 627440; saporirestaurant.co.uk ) serves a wide range of Italian dishes. It has a children's menu and can cater for large groups. The Cottage (01253 764081; cottagefishandchips.co.uk ) is a long-established, Rick Stein-endorsed fish and chip restaurant a little way back from the prom. What else to do Until November 7, the Winter Gardens hosts Illuminasia , the world's largest indoor illuminations, and, together with the Grand Theatre, boasts glorious Victorian architecture. The plush Tower Ballroom echoes with memories (take your silver sling-backs), the delightful Grundy Art Gallery stages interesting exhibitions, and the prom has been ambitiously regenerated with public art, re-gilding the Golden Mile. And there is no shortage of pubs.
