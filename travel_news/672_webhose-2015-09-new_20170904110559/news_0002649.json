Overall, the United States is expected to be the largest market throughout the forecast period, with annual PEV sales in 2024 exceeding 860,000 in the conservative scenario and 1.2 million in the aggressive. Annual sales in Canada , which is about 1 year behind the United States in terms of vehicle availability, are expected to reach over 74,000 PEVs in the conservative scenario and over 91,000 in the aggressive by 2024.\nCurrently, PEV sales are concentrated in California , where the vehicles already account for over 3% of the state's total LD vehicle market. State incentives, alongside the mandates of the California Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Program, will likely continue to push PEV penetrations in the state to between 15% and 22% by 2024. Other ZEV Program participating states are expected to see similar growth. Outside of the ZEV states, PEV sales will grow most quickly in states with large vehicle markets, high PEV incentives, well-developed infrastructure, and a high PEV index.\nThis Navigant Research report provides data and forecasts for LD PEV sales in North America , including U.S. states, metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), and utility service territories and Canadian provinces and cities. The study estimates the number of vehicles that will be in use in specific geographic locations and assesses the potential impacts of anticipated PEV penetration in the most active PEV markets. Market forecasts for LD PEV sales and vehicles in use, segmented by scenario and geographic area, extend through 2024. The study also provides analysis of Navigant Research's EV Consumer Survey, which was used to develop the PEV demographic profile.\nKey Questions Addressed:\n-Which states, provinces, and cities in North America are most likely to have the largest penetration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs)?\n-Which metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and cities have demographic profiles that match the typical PEV owner demographics in the United States and Canada ?\n-What is the projected size of the North American PEV market over the next 10 years and where will sales grow the fastest?\n-How many vehicles will electric utilities have to prepare for in the future?\n-What are the vehicle style preferences of PEV prospects?\n-What are the anticipated vehicle purchase costs of PEV prospects?\nWho needs this report?\n-Automobile OEM marketing managers\n-Vehicle aftermarket and service management\n-Tier One supplier marketing managers\n-Electric vehicle (EV) charging equipment marketing managers\n-Electric utility management\n-State, province, and city urban planners\n-EV advocacy groups\n-Investor community\nRead the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p0395679-summary/view-report.html\nAbout Reportlinker\nReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.
