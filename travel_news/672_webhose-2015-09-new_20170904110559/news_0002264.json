The ideal setting would be a restaurant or a cafe that does not play music, or plays music at very low volume, and is not crowded. Preferably in central Delhi - Connaught Place, Khan Market - or possibly South Delhi. My budget is a maximum of Rs 1000 per person. Any suggestions? Every single place within that budget turns out to be loud and if one goes on a weekend, crowded too. The only exception I have found is the restaurant at The Rose in Hauz Khas Village but I am afraid south Delhi might not be the place I can go to this time. And The Rose too have now put in many more tables and made it congested. The only quiet places I have found are too expensive for my budget. Any suggestions would be appreciated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T06:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T06:29:23.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
