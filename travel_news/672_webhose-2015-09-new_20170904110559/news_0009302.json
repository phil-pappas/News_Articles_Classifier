Published on : Tuesday, September 8, 2015\nMake a beautiful island retreat an even sweeter experience with Amari Havodda Maldives’ special pre-opening offer!\nLocated on one of the most preserved atolls in the archipelago, Amari Havodda offers an ideal getaway within the pristine nature of the Maldives with uninterrupted views of the ocean and beyond. The resort will feature 120 villas including, “overwater” and “beach” villas. Taking inspiration from Maldivian art and designed under the concept of “natural simplicity”, the guest rooms will offer a contemporary and peaceful environment, as guests take in the soothing sounds of the ocean.\nAmari Havodda is also brimming with a host of facilities comprising a number of culinary options with international and Asian flavours, including the Amari signature all-day dining restaurant, Amaya Food Gallery, which is designed with open kitchens inspired by well-loved street foods of Asia. Guests can also enjoy creative cocktails around the main pool deck at the Thari Bar, whilst those who are a little more active can head to the Water Sports Centre or the Dive Centre to explore the colourful underwater world in the island’s house reef.\nAhead of its opening on 1 February 2016, Amari Havodda Maldives is inviting guests to lock in their time in paradise with two pre-opening packages.\nFor a short getaway, the four-night package is ideal, with prices starting at 625 USD ++ per night for two in a beach villa or the minimum seven-night package for those with a little more time to soak in the delightful Maldivian sun, starting at 520 USD ++ per night, also for two guests in a beach villa. All prices are on a full-board basis where breakfast, lunch and dinner are included. Both offers are available for booking from now until 30 September 2015, for stays between 1 February and 30 April 2016.\nSource:- Amari Hotels & Resorts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T12:10:29.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
