It is just not going to happen. But historically, diesel engines have been proved to offer exceptional fuel economy figures also when powering two-wheeled machines, superb low-down torque figures and the sort of reliability and servicing intervals typically associated with military vehicles. Traditional British manufacturers, such as Norton and BSA, toyed with diesel-powered motorcycles during the 1950s. The latter came to the conclusion that it was just too difficult to produce a reliable diesel unit that was small enough to fit inside a motorcycle frame. Records show that Alfred Smith and Arthur Sidney, of Norton, experienced greater success in their quest for two-wheeled diesel perfection but soon found that the 500cc capacity smoker, with its external flywheel and single cylinder, just was not reliable enough for everyday riding. The Star Twin Thunder Star 1200 TDI squeezes 180bhp from a 1.2-litre turbo-diesel engine An appetite for fuel efficiency and the widespread use of diesel in India and the subcontinent meant that Royal Enfield, which now has its headquarters in Chennai (Madras), persevered with the technology. Up until recently, you could walk into a Royal Enfield showroom and purchase a diesel motorcycle, but strict emissions regulations have meant that the rare beasts have slowly faded away. But that is not to say that diesel bikes are now extinct, as a number of small companies have continued worshipping at the altar of the black pump in the quest for a modern solution. The Track T-800CDI, for example, is a brutish touring bike from the Netherlands, which boasts an engine borrowed from a Smart car, a full Brembo brake system and an upright touring frame that steals styling cues from BMW's GS models and Yamaha's Super Tenere. Diesel power: the Track T800CDI Its makers claim it can rocket from 0 to 60mph in just four seconds, while it achieves a fuel economy figure of 140mpg. The continuously variable transmission may baffle many modern bikers, but with proper care and attention the engine is predicted to last 250,000 miles. If speed is more your thing, perhaps the Star Twin Thunder Star 1200 TDI should warrant a place in the garage. Despite its slightly daft name, it manages to squeeze around 180bhp from an innocent three-cylinder 1.2-litre turbo-diesel engine that has been ported from a humble Volkswagen Lupo. Clever engine mapping and plenty of carbon fibre bodywork ensures this super-light sports bike can tear up a race circuit, while returning a wallet-pleasing 95mpg when cruising through town. Regardless of impressive torque and performance figures, the Hero MotoCorp RNT is arguably the most likely to make production. The concept has been designed for the congested streets of India, where its diesel-electric hybrid powertrain is predicted to eke every last mile out of the fuel tank. It might not be the best-looking machine on the market but its blend of frugality, tank-like reliability and everyday practicality is the absolute embodiment of the diesel motorcycle mantra.

Non-premium fuels can, over time, cause gunk to build-up on critical fuel system components such as diesel engine fuel injectors – which can rob engines of power. Shell V-Power Nitro+ Diesel is formulated to help recover engine power lost to performance-robbing deposits. Shell's advanced formulation is designed to work under the extreme conditions of the fuel injection system, breaking down and cleaning away harmful gunky deposits. Shell V-Power Nitro+ Diesel is also designed to form a protective film on metal surfaces, which decreases the corrosion rate, helping to protect precision fuel system components.
