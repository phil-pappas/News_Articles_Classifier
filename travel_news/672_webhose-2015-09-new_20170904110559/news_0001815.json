Although you might have trampolined before, the likelihood is that you've never done it quite like this!\nThe new Jump In arena offers 3D Dodgeball, a Kid Zone, Foam Pits, tumble tracks and a huge main court where people can jump freely between interconnected trampolines and literally bounce off the walls. Fancy trying to defy gravity? This is a great place to start! And if you're not sure how to develop a jumping style, live trampoline comedy acts will be performing at the launch to show you exactly how NOT to do it!\nJump In is open to all ages, although under 18s will need parental consent and the under 5s will require parental supervision. It is clean, safe, and exhilarating, giving families a chance to have fun and get fit together. And when you've done enough jumping around, you can recoup your energy in the fabulous on-site caf√©, filled with local produce, gourmet ice-cream, handmade cakes, hand-roasted coffee and more.\nJump In just opened to the public on 10 September 2015 .\nhttps://www.gojumpin.com/\nAbout Jump In:\nAddress: 550 Dundee Road, Slough SL1 4LE\nGrand Opening: 10th September 2015 .

Founders Linsey Willaford-West and Vernon West were visiting family in Fort Worth Texas when they came across Altitude Trampoline Park. They brought their toddler to the park and had so much fun that they came back nearly every day of the remainder of their trip! When they came back to the UK, they didn't want the fun to stop and knew they had to bring the concept to their local neighbourhood. They reached out to Gavin Lucas to co-found and head up the organisation. Gavin was happily heading up a large division of DHL at the time, but was compelled by the unique opportunity as he was always passionate about sports and a fellow parent and could see trampoline parks transforming the way Brits get fit and play.\nJump In is powered by Altitude Trampoline Parks , which is a leading international operator with multiple sites across the US as well as park development in Japan , UAE, South Africa and India .\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.gojumpin.com/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=enUK201509189925&Transmission_Id=201509180325PR_NEWS_USPR_____enUK201509189925&DateId=20150918", "http://altitudetrampolinepark.com/page.cfm", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T13:05:56.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
