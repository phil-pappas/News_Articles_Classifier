July and August are the busiest periods for overall global passenger traffic due to holiday travel and tourism activity, particularly in the northern hemisphere. This represents a banner month for passenger numbers since growth is significantly above the trend. \n\nAll regions posted significant growth in passenger traffic, although Middle Eastern airports continue to stand out as aviation’s fulcrum. Dubai (DXB), the world’s busiest airport for international passengers, had depressed figures in 2014 due to runway refurbishment over the summer months, which resulted in a growth rate of 29.5% year over year in passenger traffic. Even without including DXB’s growth for the month, the region as a whole would have still recorded double-digit growth on the back of other strong performing airports such as Doha (DOH), Abu Dhabi (AUH) and Tel-Aviv (TLV), which grew their passenger traffic by 24.9%, 23.3% and 18.9% respectively. \n\n\nHubs in other regions also recorded strong growth. Passenger traffic at Istanbul (IST), Jakarta (CGK) and Shanghai (PVG) grew by 16.9%, 15.3% and 14.7% respectively. Madrid (MAD) continues to make large strides following the recession and Euro area woes. The airport grew by over 13% in July. \n\n\nUnlike the record high growth rates in global passenger numbers, air freight volumes were flat with respect to year-over-year growth in July. A slowdown in key emerging markets such as China, as well as oil producing economies, translated into weakness in other sectors of the economy. The strong correlation between changes in air freight volumes and the business cycle coupled with the fact that a high concentration of the world’s major air freight hubs are located in the Asia Pacific region has inevitably resulted in a slowdown. The region’s top five airports experienced a contraction in freight volumes for the month of July. Hong Kong (HKG) dropped by 1.9%. \n\n\nNorth American air freight volumes were slightly more mixed with respect to year-over-year growth among the region’s busiest hubs. That being said, the net result was flat growth for the region as a whole. Whereas Memphis (MEM), a FedEx hub, and Louisville (SDF), a UPS hub, experienced growth of 2.5% and 4.2% respectively, airports that have a larger international component to their freight saw volumes drop. Anchorage (ANC) and Miami (MIA) saw air freight traffic drop by 5.6% and 2.3% respectively.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T17:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T17:29:14.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
