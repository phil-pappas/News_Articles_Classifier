August was also its busiest ever month for arrivals, with 3.75 million passengers landing at the airport.\nThe record numbers come after Heathrow claimed there is more local support for Heathrow expansion than opposition.\nIn a poll commissioned by the airport it showed 50 per cent of residents from 12 constituencies close to Heathrow are in support of expansion with 33 per cent opposed.\nThe research is the first since the Airports Commission made a recommendation to government that Heathrow should expand.\nChair of the Commission Howard Davies urged the government to make an early decision or risk the UK falling behind as an economy:\n“Further delay will be increasingly costly and will be seen, nationally and internationally, as a sign that the UK is unwilling or unable to take the steps needed to maintain its position as a well-connected open trading economy in the twenty first century.”\nDavies also confirmed that Heathrow could grow within environmental limits and operate “more quietly” than it does today.\n“A bigger Heathrow would not inflict noise nuisance on more people than the airport does today, and the people affected would be far better compensated.”\nHeathrow CEO John Holland-Kaye said: “With more local residents supporting Heathrow than opposing it, and with the backing of the Airports Commission, airlines, trade unions and businesses across the country, Heathrow expansion is the right and deliverable solution for the whole of the UK. Every month that we delay is costing our economy £1bn.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-09-10T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T15:10:39.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
