Today, it is the Maldives that is the flavor of the month, and they are being recorded as being among the top ten destinations for Brazilians as far as numbers go. Seychelles is set to become the next destination for Brazilians,\" said Minister St.Ange of the Seychelles. \nThe press meetings all confirmed the same message to the Seychelles Minister and congratulated the island's Brazil Office for keeping the flag of Seychelles flying high in Brazil. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
