Maybe if you had only ordered a Tunnock’s tea cake and a glass of water it would be acceptable (though it’s hard to imagine what kind of oddball would place such an order). But if you had consumed anything more, and if the waitress had been kind enough to deliver your order all the way to your table, would she not deserve a little extra for her travails? The much-loved author Bill Bryson certainly thinks so, judging by his diatribe against the bad manners of some middle-class Britons, inspired by a woman he spotted placing just 10p in a café tip jar. Bill Bryson photographed in London, September 2013 Photo: Rii Schroer Now, it must be noted that Bryson is from the US , where tips are lavish and make up a good part of the staffs’ wages. In return, one is overwhelmed by unsolicited attention from one’s waiter (“how’s that food going down? Wanna take some home? Need me to bag it up for you? Are your socks comfortable?” etc). But even here, on the eponymous Small Island of Bryson’s bestseller, it is generally agreed that tipping decently in cafes and restaurants is right and proper, provided the staff have not thrown the soup in your face and actually receive the tip themselves ( we’re mentioning no names, Cote ). According to Debrett’s , the undisputed authority on such social niceties, “it is usual to offer 10 per cent.” Where doubt starts to creep in is in other scenarios: taxis, hairdressers , hotels, Ocado deliveries…What the deuce are the rules here? Again, Debrett’s suggests tipping is customary in the first three situations. We presume they are still formulating their policy on offering gratuities to Ocado delivery men. Otherwise, the advice is to “use your discretion but err on the side of generosity.” Which is probably just as well applied to all areas of life.
