What could be a more romantic start to married life than a ceremony in a beachfront paradise with swaying coconut palms and colour bursts of exotic blooms set against a timeless panorama of blue sky and sea? After the euphoria of announcing an engagement, planning for the big day can be a daunting task, especially when hearts are set on a destination wedding. It can involve lists of props and requirements, perfectionist requests – can we customise our guests’ welcome bags? Can we dance to a calypso band? – and queries about staples such as photography, flowers, decorations and cake. Possibly the cleverest interpretation of the Sandals all-inclusive concept is the unique WeddingMoon ® service. Not only do you have your own wedding planner to guide you every step of the way, but you can hitch your wedding to your honeymoon so that the happy-ever-after starts the minute you've exchanged vows. When you have the all-included resort amenities and activities at hand – luxurious Love Nest Dream Suites, gourmet dining and water sports – you are free to fulfil the Sandals’ mantra that “love is all you need”. Wedding planners are experts at putting together bespoke packages that include photography, videography and spa and beauty services Stay three nights or more and you will receive a free Beautiful Beginnings wedding (subject to mandatory government and administration fees. Further terms and conditions may apply). Organisation comes with a relaxed vibe, allowing you to enjoy the process of creating and celebrating a magical occasion. Will Jamaica, Antigua, St Lucia, the Bahamas, Grenada or Barbados be the venue? What is your dream colour palette? There are 14 options from which to customise and coordinate items such as bouquet, centrepiece, table linen and floral touches. When it comes to confetti, it’s a cloudburst of exotic petals. Bouquet and boutonniere? How about a hand-tied bird of paradise posy and matching single bloom for the groom. Music? A steel pan soloist or jazz duo? The wedding planners are experts at putting together bespoke packages that include photography, videography, spa and beauty services, and so on. You can keep it as simple as a barefoot beach ceremony with a floaty, gauze-wrapped gazebo and walkway of fresh flower petals – and treasure those memories of walking hand in hand along the sand. Whether you opt for an intimate or a formal ceremony with guests, here’s what is included: preparation of marriage documents, musical accompaniment, petals on your bed on your first honeymoon night, personal pre-planning and wedding consultant with dedicated resort team, honeymoon dinner for bride and groom with complimentary sparkling wine, hors d'oeuvres reception for bride, groom and six guests – even a decadent breakfast in bed, and a honeymoon photograph.

As happy bride Leah says: “Any day that starts with coffee on the beach, a swim before the ceremony, and ends with marrying your best friend under palm trees surrounded by the people you love most in the world will forever be the best day of my life.” • For more information on Caribbean holidays, visit sandals.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T22:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T20:27:22.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
