We are an airport, not a hotel.\" \n“I think it is now time for someone to help these to ladies decide where they want to travel from Larnaca airport.\" \nThe two have become known to airport staff, not unlike the character played by Tom Hanks in the film The Terminal, who begins living at JFK Airport after being stuck in travel limbo due to being denied entry to the US, while a coup unfolds in his fictional home country of Krakozhia. \nThe film was based on the real life story of Karimi Nasseri, an Iranian refugee who lived in the departure lounge of Terminal One in Charles de Gaulle Airport for 18 years, before being hospitalized and eventually transferred to a Paris homeless shelter. \nThe German mother is believed to have relatives in Israel and wants to return but is waiting for their status to be cleared. \nIn the meantime, the two have refused any formal aid or assistance from the airport, but have also refused to leave. \nGerman embassy officials in Nicosia said they had searched their files, but had no open case on the mother. \n\"Officially, she has never approached the embassy for assistance,\" an embassy spokesman told the Telegraph, noting that any potential embassy assistance, however, would likely involve traveling back to Germany, not Israel. \nThe Catholic aid organization Caritas, which operates across the island, also said they were not familiar with the case – despite having an aid office at Larnaca Airport. \n“Had this been known of course we could have offered them help from health and welfare or help them get a place at the Nicosia women’s shelter,” said a member of Caritas staff. “When we have EU citizens in this situation in Cyprus it is almost always a mental health issue.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T00:25:48.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
