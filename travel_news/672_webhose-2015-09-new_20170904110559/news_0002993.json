Two flew back and forth from one side of the locks to the other for an hour. One finally showed some mercy and alighted right above my head.” \nKatie’s critique: “This kingfisher is perfectly framed between the branches, which makes this frame. The clean blue background also makes the bird stand out beautifully. I enjoy the depth of field that allows for a small bit of layering to add some dimension to an otherwise straight-on shot.” Most Read Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T01:52:05.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
