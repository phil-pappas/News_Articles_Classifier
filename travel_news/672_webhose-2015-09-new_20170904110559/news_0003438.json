Wizz Air currently operates 63 180-seat A320s, six of which are also financed by CDB Leasing and were delivered in 2014-2015.\nWizz Air takes delivery of its first A321ceo, or current engine option, in November and its second in December. These aircraft are part of an existing order with Airbus. Wizz Air also recently confirmed a new order from Airbus for 110 new A321neo aircraft that, if approved by shareholders, will begin delivery in 2019.\nCDB Leasing is based in Shenzhen, China.\nSource:- Wizz Air", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T15:32:40.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
