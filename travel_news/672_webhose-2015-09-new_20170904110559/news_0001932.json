Depending on the utility company, rates will decrease by 1.15 to 3.82 percent starting on Oct. 1.\nThat applies to electricity rates from the country’s eight power distribution companies and corresponds to ARESEP’s most recent calculation of variations in fuel prices conducted last week.\nAnnual projections in December 2014 showed that the country during the last quarter of 2015 would be required to spend ₡2 billion ($3.8 million) in fuel for thermal generation.\n“The current estimates are that generators will not be required to use any of the thermal plants over the next three months, therefore, the purchase of fuel for that period will cost zero colones,” ARESEP reported.\nThe Costa Rican Electricity Institute supported ARESEP’s evaluation and reported that according to their latest projections, reservoir levels at hydroelectric plants will remain stable for the last quarter.\nARESEP also stated that the launching of new generation projects and opportunities to buy imported energy at lower prices in the regional electricity market also favored lower rates.\nThe complete list of approved decreases by company can be found on ARESEP’s website .\nContact L.
