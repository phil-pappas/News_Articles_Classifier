Corella said that the bill would legally regulate “digital transportation platforms and other forms of collective movement.”\nThe opinion from the Government Attorney, dated Sept. 25, said that Uber is a public service — a designation that the company has disputed — and therefore requires permission from the Public Transportation Council to operate legally. The opinion said that Uber’s service is not protected under the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement with the United States because it is a public service, a category not covered by the free commerce clauses of DR-CAFTA. Drivers who offer transportation services in any form without permission “should be punished and fined,” according to the opinion written by Omar Rivera Mesén.\n“The response demonstrates that our transportation legislation should be modernized to cover new service technologies and platforms in this area,” Corella said in a statement, adding that the bill should take into consideration the “new realities” that technology was creating.\nCorella said he would set up a roundtable between taxi drivers, private transportation services, the Public Works and Transport Ministry and the Public Services Regulatory Authority to determine a regulatory framework for ride-hailing technology here.\nThe Tico Times contacted Uber for comment but did not receive a response by close of business Tuesday.\nThe Government Attorney’s Office opinion was the second to come down from the government against Uber. On Sept. 12, the Public Transport Council issued a similar legal opinion , saying that Uber’s operations were illegal. After two drivers were fined and their cars impounded by Transportation Police on Uber’s first day of service on Aug. 21, there haven’t been any further reports of official actions against drivers for the app-based service.\nDespite the decisions against Uber, the company has continued to operate and recruit new drivers. The company announced Tuesday evening that the private automobile insurer Quálitas would start offering specialized policies for Uber drivers in Costa Rica.\nRead the full opinion from the Government Attorney’s Office (in Spanish):\nContact Zach Dyer at zdyer@ticotimes.net", "external_links": ["https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2435358-government-attorney-office-legal-opinion-on-uber.js"], "published": "2015-09-30T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T13:12:06.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
