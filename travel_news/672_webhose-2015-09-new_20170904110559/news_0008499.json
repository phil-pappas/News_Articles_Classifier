(NYSE: KEN, TASE: KEN) announces its results for the second quarter in 2015 as well as additional updates.\nKey Highlights\nOn July 23, 2015 , we completed the pro rata distribution in specie of our ordinary shares of Tower (NASDAQ and TASE: TSEM). On August 31, 2015 , IC Power Pte. Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, filed a Registration Statement on Form F-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. IC Power's net income attributable to controlling shareholder (Kenon) for the six months and three months ended June 30, 2015 , as reported by IC Power, was $33 million and $17 million , respectively[1]. IC Power's Adjusted EBITDA for the six months and three months ended June 30, 2015 , as reported by IC Power, was $175 million and $90 million , respectively. IC Power's results of operations this quarter were impacted by lower margins at OPC due in part to the lower tariffs published by the Israel Public Utilities Authority (Electricity) (PUAE) in January 2015 , as OPC's tariffs for customers are based on PUAE rates; the PUAE has announced further tariff reductions effective from September 2015 . IC Power continued to develop its assets in advanced stages of construction. As of June 30, 2015 , CDA (a 510 MW hydro project in Peru ), Samay I (a 600 MW thermoelectric project in Peru ) and Kanan (a 92 MW thermal generation project in Panama ) have invested $787 million , $268 million and $61 million , respectively, in their respective construction, and have completed 79%, 76% and 76% of these projects, respectively. In Q2 2015, we and our JV partner Chery each provided a RMB400 million ( $64 million ) shareholder loan to Qoros; also in Q2, Kenon provided a back-to-back guarantee to Chery for RMB175 million ( $28 million ), plus up to RMB 30 million of related fees, in connection with Qoros' drawdown of RMB350m ( $56 million ) under a long-term loan, which drawdown is guaranteed by Chery. Discussion of Results for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2015\nSet forth below is a discussion of Kenon's results of operations. Kenon's consolidated results of operations essentially comprise the results of I.C. Power Ltd. (\"IC Power\"). The results of Qoros Automotive Co., Ltd. (\"Qoros\"), ZIM Integrated Shipping Ltd. (\"ZIM\") and Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (\"Tower\") are reflected under results from associates. For a summary of the net income contribution from Kenon's subsidiaries and associated companies, see Appendix A .\nIC Power\nIC Power has identified as the reportable segments for its consolidated financial statements: Peru , Israel , Central America (which consists of Nicaragua , Guatemala , El Salvador and Panama ) and Other, which reflects the results of the additional countries in which IC Power operates ( Bolivia , Chile , the Dominican Republic , Jamaica and Colombia ) and IC Power's share in income from associated companies and holding company results.\nSee Appendix B for IC Power's consolidated financial information. See Appendix C for the definition of IC Power's Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-IFRS financial measure, and for a reconciliation to IC Power's net income. See Appendix D for summary financial information of IC Power's subsidiaries for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014. See Appendix E for summary financial information of IC Power's segments for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2014 .\nThe following discussion of IC Power's results of operations below is derived from IC Power's consolidated financial statements (which reflect the certain adjustments described in Appendix B ).\nRevenues\nIC Power's revenues were $333 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to $336 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 , reflecting a 1% year-on-year (\"YoY\") decrease. See below a discussion of revenues by segment for the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2014 .\nPeru – $117 million , compared to $102 million in the three months ended June 30, 2014 , reflecting a 15% YoY increase, primarily as a result of an increase in the volume of energy sold by Kallpa this quarter to 1,592 GWh from 1,445 GWh in the three months ended June 30 , 2014 and an increase in Kallpa's revenue from transmission tolls this quarter to $21 million from $15 million in the three months ended June 30, 2014 . Israel – $69 million , compared to $93 million in the three months ended June 30, 2014 , reflecting a 26% YoY decrease, primarily resulting from a decline in Israel's PUAE generation component tariff in 2015, which forms the basis of OPC's energy prices, and the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the New Israeli Shekel. OPC's average price of energy sold decreased from $93 per MWh in the three months ended June 30, 2014 to $71 per MWh this quarter. Central America – $97 million , compared to $87 million in the three months ended June 30, 2014 , reflecting an 11% YoY increase, primarily a result of the acquisition and consolidation of Puerto Quetzal ( Guatemala ) in September 2014 . Other – $50 million , compared to $54 million in the three months ended June 30, 2014 , reflecting a 7% YoY decrease, primarily as a result of the expiration of a PPA of CEPP ( Dominican Republic ), which reduced CEPP's volumes and the prices at which it sold its energy. These effects were partially offset by an increase in revenues at JPPC ( Jamaica ), which IC Power started consolidating in May 2014 . Cost of Sales\nIC Power's cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) was $234 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to $244 million in the three months ended June 30, 2014 , reflecting a 4% YoY decrease. See below a discussion of cost of sales by segment for the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2014\nPeru – $68 million , compared to $63 million in the three months ended June 30, 2014 , reflecting a 8% YoY increase, primarily as a result of an $8 million increase in spot energy purchases to address Kallpa's customers higher consumption and a $2 million increase in transmission charges. These increases were partially offset by a $4 million decline in gas costs as a result of Kallpa's lower generation and a $2 million decrease in maintenance expenses. Israel – $57 million , compared to $71 million in the three months ended June 30, 2014 , reflecting a 20% YoY decrease, due to lower gas costs (as OPC's gas costs are in part indexed to the PUAE tariff, which was lower in 2015) and the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the New Israeli Shekel. In addition, costs of sales in the three months ended June 30, 2014 included the effect of certain provisions that have subsequently been revised as discussed in Appendix B . Central America – $77 million , compared to $72 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 , reflecting a 7% YoY increase, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Puerto Quetzal in September 2014 . Other – $34 million , compared to $39 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 , reflecting a 14% YoY decrease, primarily reflecting an $8 million decline in CEPP as a result of a decrease in spot energy purchases and fuel cost, which was partially offset by a $5 million increase in JPPC's fuel and maintenance costs. Adjusted EBITDA\nIC Power's Adjusted EBITDA was $90 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to $74 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 , reflecting a 22% YoY increase, primarily as a result of the following (by segment):\nPeru - an $8 million increase, primarily as a result of an increase in the volume of energy sold; Israel – a $6 million decrease, primarily as a result of lower margins due to a weaker New Israeli Shekel against the US Dollar and lower PUAE tariffs in 2015, which resulted in a $24 million decline in revenues but only a $14 million decline in cost of sales; Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended June 30, 2014 also included certain provisions that were subsequently revised (see Appendix B for further information); Central America - a $2 million increase, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Puerto Quetzal, which increased the Adjusted EBITDA by $5 million , and was partially offset by a $5 million decline in ICPNH's EBITDA, primarily as a result of higher maintenance expenses incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2015 ; and Other - a $12 million increase, primarily as a result of a $3 million decline in legal expenses at Inkia, a $4 million dividend payment received from Edegel in the three months ended June 30, 2015 , and a $4 million increase as a result of the acquisitions of JPPC ( Jamaica ) and Surpetroil ( Colombia ). Net Income\nIC Power's net income was $21 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to $16 million in the three months ended June 30, 2014 , reflecting a 31% YoY increase, primarily as a result of the increase in its Adjusted EBITDA and the following:\n$13 million decline in finance expenses, in part, as a result of a $95 million repayment of the capital notes owed to Israel Corporation Ltd. in June 2014 ; and $6 million lower income tax expenses, primarily reflecting $8 million in withholding taxes in the three months ended June 30, 2014 related to dividends received by IC Power from Inkia. The above effects were partially offset by the recognition in the three months ended June 30, 2014 of the $24 million gain on bargain-purchase recognized by IC Power from the acquisition of JPPC in 2014.\nIC Power's net income from continuing operations by segment for the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2014 were as follows:\nPeru – $15 million net income, compared to net income of $10 million in the three months ended June 30, 2014 Israel – $4 million net loss, compared to net income of $1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2014 Central America – $9 million net income, compared to net income of $5 million in the three months ended June 30, 2014 Other – $1 million net loss, compared to a net loss of $3 million in the three months ended June 30, 2014 Capital Expenditures\nIC Power's capital expenditures was $219 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015 , primarily relating to the expenditures of CDA ( $72 million ), Samay I ( $122 million ) and Kanan ( $11 million ).\nQoros\nKenon recognizes 50% of Qoros' results under \"share in income from associates.\" The discussion below reflects 100% of Qoros' financial results and contains conversions of certain RMB amounts into U.S. Dollars at a rate of 6.2: 1 RMB /U.S. Dollar.\nSee Appendix F for Qoros' consolidated financial information.\nRevenues\nQoros had revenues of RMB368 million ( $59 million ) for the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to RMB209 million ( $34 million ) for the three months ended June 30, 2014 , reflecting a 76% YoY increase. Qoros sold 3,256 vehicles during the period (compared to 1,671 vehicles in Q2 2014), representing a 95% YoY increase in the number of vehicles sold.\nCost of Sales\nQoros' costs of sales were RMB366 million ( $59 million ) for the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared RMB187 million ( $30 million ) for the three months ended June 30, 2014 , reflecting a 96% YoY increase, as a result of the increase in the number of vehicles sold as compared to Q2 2014.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nQoros continues to invest in the research and development of its next vehicle model scheduled for launch in early 2016, the Qoros 5 SUV, and the 2016 model year versions of the Qoros 3 Sedan, the Qoros 3 Hatch and the Qoros 3 City SUV. Qoros had research and development expenses of RMB72 million ( $12 million ) in the three months ended June 30 , 2015\nSelling and Distribution Expenses\nQoros had selling and distribution expenses of RMB150 million ( $24 million ) in the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to RMB208 million ( $34 million ) in the three months ended June 30, 2014 , reflecting a 28% YoY decrease, as Qoros did not launch a marketing or advertising campaign during the first half of 2015.\nAdministration Expenses\nQoros had administration expenses of RMB147 million ( $24 million ) in the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to RMB168 million ( $27 million ) in the three months ended June 30, 2014 , reflecting a 12% YoY decrease.\nFinance Costs, Net\nQoros had finance costs of RMB93 million ( $15 million ) in the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to RMB29 million ( $5 million ) in the three months ended June 30, 2014 due to an increase in total debt outstanding.\nLoss for the Period\nAs a result of the above, Qoros had a loss of RMB476 million ( $77 million ) in the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to RMB487 million ( $79 million ) in the three months ended June 30, 2014 .\nCapital Expenditures\nQoros had capital expenditures of RMB386 million ( $62 million ) in the three months ended June 30, 2015 . During this period, Qoros made investments in its next SUV model and the 2016 model year versions of the Qoros 3 Sedan, the Qoros 3 Hatch, and the Qoros 3 City SUV.\nZIM\nIn the three months ended June 30, 2015 , ZIM recorded operating income and net income attributable to the owners of ZIM of $42 million and $10 million , respectively, as compared to an operating loss and net loss attributable to the owners of ZIM of $9 million and $69 million , respectively, in the three months ended June 30, 2014 . ZIM's improved results, following its restructuring in July 2014 , are primarily the result of a decrease in operating expenses (resulting, in part, from a decrease in bunker expenses) and a decline in ZIM's financing expenses, which is partially offset by a decrease in revenues, primarily as a result of a decline in carried cargo (resulting, in part, from ZIM's closure of a line from Asia to Northern Europe ) and a decline in average revenue per TEU (twenty foot equivalent unit). ZIM publishes its results on its website. For more information, see www.ZIM.com . This website, and any information referenced therein, is not incorporated by reference herein.\nTower\nOn July 23, 2015 , Kenon completed the pro rata distribution of 18,030,041 ordinary shares of Tower, marking one of the key steps in the implementation of Kenon's strategy. The 18,030,041 ordinary shares distributed by Kenon represent all of the shares in Tower owned by Kenon, excluding the 1,669,795 shares in Tower underlying certain warrants held by Kenon.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nKenon (Unconsolidated)\nAs of June 30, 2015 , the total drawings outstanding under Kenon's $200 million credit facility from Israel Corporation Ltd. was $110 million .\nAs of June 30, 2015 , cash, gross debt, and net debt (a non-IFRS financial measure, which is defined as total debt minus cash) at Kenon (parent company) were $19 million , $113 million and $95 million, respectively.\nIC Power\nAs of June 30, 2015 , IC Power's financial liabilities (excluding payables and derivative instruments) amounted to $2,514 million , cash, cash equivalents, short term deposits, including restricted cash of $621 million , and net financial liabilities (a non-IFRS financial measure, which is defined as financial liabilities minus monetary assets) amounted to $1,893 million .\nQoros\nAs of June 30, 2015 , Qoros had loans and borrowings of RMB8.7 billion ( $1.4 billion ), including RMB3.0 billion ( $484 million ) of shareholder loans, and current cash and cash equivalents of RMB565 million ( $91 million ).\nBusiness Developments\nIC Power\nAssets Under Construction\nUpdate on assets in advanced stages of construction: - CDA\nAs of June 30, 2015 , CDA has received proceeds of $547 million from the $591 million available debt facilities for this project.\nAs of June 30, 2015 , CDA has invested an aggregate $787 million in the project and has completed 79% of the project, with 87% of the dam construction and 100% of the tunnel drilling completed.\nCDA is expected to commence commercial operation by the middle of 2016 and has an estimated construction cost of $954 million .\n- Samay I\nAs of June 30, 2015 , Samay I has received $252 million in proceeds from the $311 million financing facility obtained for this project.\nAs of June 30, 2015 , Samay I has invested an aggregate $268 million in the project and has completed 76% of the project.\nSamay I is expected to commenced commercial operation by the middle of 2016 and has an estimated construction cost of $380 million .\n- Kanan\nAs of June 30, 2015 , Kanan has invested an aggregate $61 million in the project (including $40 million of intercompany expenses relating to Puerto Quetzal's and CEPP's sale of the barges to Kanan) and has completed 76% of the project.\nKanan is expected to commence commercial operation by the end of 2015 and has an estimated construction cost of $73 million (including $40 million of intercompany expenses relating to Puerto Quetzal's and CEPP's sale of the barges to Kanan).\nOn August 10, 2015 , IC Power acquired Advanced Integrated Energy (\"AIE\"), which holds a conditional license for the construction of a 120 MW cogeneration natural gas power plant and will seek regulatory approval for licenses in respect of an additional 25 MW in Israel , for NIS 60 million (approximately $16 million ). The project is in the advanced development stage and construction is expected to commence in early 2016. Based upon its initial assessment, IC Power expects that the total cost of completing the AIE plant (including the consideration for the acquisition of AIE and the construction cost of the power station) will be approximately $200 million . The AIE plant is expected to commence commercial operations in the second half of 2018. Project pipeline: IC Power is currently assessing various projects in Israel and various Latin American countries, such as Chile , Colombia , Guatemala , Mexico , Peru , Panama , the Dominican Republic , and Nicaragua . These potential projects range in size from small-scale power facilities (e.g., less than 40 MW) to large-scale power facilities (e.g., approximately 550 MW) and utilize different fuels and technologies, including natural gas, hydroelectric, wind, and stranded gas. IC Power is also considering acquiring companies and assets in power generation and related businesses (e.g., transmission and distribution companies or assets). There is no guarantee that IC Power will proceed with any of the above-mentioned projects. Decisions by the PUAE ( Israel's Power Regulator)\nIn August 2015 , Israel's Public Utilities Authority (the PUAE) published a decision that independent power producers (\"IPPs\") in Israel would be obligated to pay system management service charges, retroactively from June 1, 2013 . According to the PUAE decision, the amount of system management service charges that would be payable by OPC from the effective date to June 2015 is approximately NIS 152 million (approximately $40 million ), not including interest rate and linkage costs. IC Power is considering the implications of this decision and may contest it. This decision has resulted in a revision in certain provisions that had been taken by OPC, and has resulted in adjustments to IC Power's income statement. Specifically, IC Power's cost of sales were adjusted downwards by $46 million and $6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 and the three months ended March 31, 2015 , respectively, resulting in a corresponding upward adjustment in IC Power's Adjusted EBITDA in those periods; there was no adjustment to Kenon's financials during those periods, but Kenon recognized a $52 million gain ( $31 million for Kenon's shareholders after tax effect) in the three months ended June 30, 2015 in connection with its revision of this provision in its financial statements for the three months ended June 30 , 2015. For more information, see Appendix B.\nIn August 2015 , the PUAE also published a notice for a hearing regarding tariff updates effective from September 9, 2015 . Such tariffs reflect a decline in the generation component tariff from NIS 300.9 per MWh and NIS 301.5 per MWh to a single tariff of NIS 260.2 per MWh. OPC uses privately negotiated rates to sell electricity to customers under its PPAs, but such rates are expressed as a discount to the generation component included within the PUAE rate, so a decline in PUAE rates will result in a corresponding decline in OPC's rates and, accordingly, its revenues. OPC's main cost of sales is gas, and prices for the gas it consumes under its supply agreement with the Tamar Group are indexed in part to the PUAE generation component tariff and NIS/USD exchange rate. However, the supply agreement also contains a floor price and, as a result of previous declines in the PUAE generation component tariff, OPC will soon begin to pay the floor price, so the decline in the tariff will result in a greater decline in OPC's margins.\nQoros\nCar Sales\nIn the three months ended June 30, 2015 , Qoros sold approximately 3,256 vehicles as compared to 2,488 vehicles sold in the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 1,671 vehicles in the three months ended June 30, 2014 , representing an increase of 31% and 95%, respectively.\nIn the six months ended June 30, 2015 , Qoros sold 5,744 vehicles as compared to 2,561 vehicles sold in the six months ended June 30, 2014 .\nIn July 2015, Qoros sold 1,230 cars.\nDealerships\nAs of June 30, 2015 , there were 81 Qoros dealerships (70 of which were operational), 12 additional dealerships under construction, and twenty three signed Memorandums of Understanding with respect to the development of 23 additional dealerships.\nQoros Brand Day\nOn August 19, 2015 Qoros held a Qoros Brand Day in its Changshu plant with approximately 120 media personnel, 100 car owners and Key Opinion Leaders, and 33 dealers in attendance. The Qoros Brand Day event served as the kick-off for a series of Qoros marketing campaigns focusing on its brand positioning and product line updates.\nQoros also launched the new 2016 model year versions of the Qoros 3 Sedan, the Qoros 3 Hatch and the Qoros 3 City SUV. Two additional trims are also being offered for each of the Qoros 3 Sudan and the Qoros 3 Hatch, which has extended Qoros' pricing range to the RMB100,000 entry price.\nAwards\nIn April 2015 , the Qoros 3 Sedan was awarded a 5 plus star safety rating in the China – New Car Assessment Program (C-NCAP)'s 2015 crash test, and received the highest score ever in its 9-year history.\nIn July 2015 , Qoros received a Connected Service Award at the 2015 China Auto Customer Care Award in recognition of the QorosQloud. Qoros was the only Chinese brand among the eight brands which received a 2015 China Auto Customer Care Award in July.\nShareholder Investments in Qoros and Guarantees of Qoros Bank Debt\nIn Q2 2015, Kenon and Chery each provided a RMB400 million ( $64 million ) shareholder loan to Qoros.\nAlso in Q2 2015, Kenon provided a back-to-back guarantee to Chery for RMB175 million ( $28 million ), plus up to RMB30 million of related fees, in connection with Qoros' drawdown of RMB350m ( $56 million ) under a long-term loan, which drawdown is guaranteed by Chery.\nVoluntarily Recall of Certain Vehicle Models\nIn July 2015 , Qoros voluntarily recalled 6,736 vehicles as a result of information derived from frontal impact crash tests of new Qoros models under development, which suggested that certain Qoros vehicles already in production and in the market may have had safety belt pre-tensioner system crimping assembly process issues. Regarding customer safety as an absolute priority, Qoros decided to recall all vehicles within the scope of impact and to replace the front safety belt pre-tensioner free of charge, to eliminate any risk. As of the date of this release, Qoros has not received any field incidences or customer complaints related to this defect across any of its vehicles in the market.\nChina Vehicle Market Conditions\nThe overall passenger vehicle market in China continued to grow in the first half of 2015 with a 7% YoY growth rate and 8.97 million units sold during this period. The first quarter of 2015 experienced an 11% YoY growth rate, and the second quarter of 2015 experienced a 3% YoY growth rate. This growth was unevenly distributed by segment; sales in the C Sedan and Hatch segments decreased by 10% and 34% YoY, respectively, while sales in the SUV segment increased by 43% YoY. Some auto manufacturers are offering significant price reductions, discounts, and/or rebates, to stimulate purchases of their vehicles. In addition, as sales are generally lower during the summer, Qoros expects such price reductions to continue, and potentially escalate, during the third quarter of 2015.\nAdditionally, the Shanghai Composite Index has declined by more than 30% percent since mid-June and this decline in China's stock market could further impact negatively consumption rates and the purchase of costly items, such as vehicles, throughout China . In light of current financial market and economic conditions in China , which could affect vehicle sales industry-wide in China , Qoros may find it challenging to so increase sales, and may even experience a decline in sales.\nQoros is evaluating appropriate measures to address the above market conditions. Qoros is also seeking to optimize its cost structure, and may undertake cost-cutting measures, including workforce optimizations, the downsizing of various departments and other measures to align its operations with its business plan.\nInvestors' Conference Call\nKenon's management will host a conference call for investors and analysts on September 8, 2015 .

Not including trade payables, other payables and credit balances and financial instruments.\n2. Not including trade receivables, other receivables and debit balances and financial instruments.\nDecisions by the PUAE ( Israel's Power Regulator)\nIn August 2015 , Israel's Public Utilities Authority (the PUAE) published a decision that independent power producers (IPPs) in Israel would be obligated to pay system management service charges, retroactively from June 1, 2013 . According to the PUAE decision, the amount of system management service charges that would be payable by OPC from the effective date to June 2015 is approximately NIS 152 million (approximately $40 million ), not including interest rate and linkage costs. IC Power is considering the implications of this decision and may contest it.\nIC Power's financial statements as of December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015 initially authorized for issuance included provisions by OPC for system management service charges and diesel surcharges in the aggregate amount of $70 million as of December 31, 2014 and $79 million as of March 31, 2015 . In IC Power's opinion, due to the PUAE decision, it is more likely than not that OPC will not be charged more than the amount that was indicated in the PUAE decision. Therefore, OPC revised the provisions, such that the revised balance of the provision as of December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015 was $27 million and $31 million , respectively. Because IC Power reapproved its financial statements in connection with its filing of a registration statement with the SEC, this revision resulted in adjustments to IC Power's income statement (a $46 million and $6 million downward adjustment in cost of sales, and all line items below cost of sales in 2014 and Q1 2015, respectively, which resulted in a corresponding upward adjustment in IC Power's Adjusted EBITDA during those periods) and in its statement of financial position as of the end of 2014 and Q1 2015; for 2014, the provisions were taken over the full year, but the adjustment was only made in Q4 2014.\nIn accordance with IFRS, Kenon revised its provisions as of June 30, 2015 , such that the revised balance of the provision as of such date in Kenon's financial statements was $38 million , resulting in a gain of $52 million in Q2 2015 ( $31 million to Kenon's shareholders after tax effect). Kenon was not required to revise its financial statements as of December 31, 2014 or March 31, 2015 , as Kenon's financial statements for these periods were already approved at the time of the PUAE's August 2015 decision. Accordingly, income statement figures in IC Power's financials for 2014 and Q1 and Q2 2015 differ from those attributable to IC Power in Kenon's financials for those periods.\nAppendix C\nIC Power's Non-IFRS Financial Measures\nThis press release, including the financial tables, presents Adjusted EBITDA, net debt and net financial liabilities, which are financial metrics considered to be \"non-IFRS financial measures.\" Non-IFRS financial measures should be evaluated in conjunction with, and are not a substitute for, IFRS financial measures. The tables also present the IFRS financial measures, which are most comparable to the non-IFRS financial measures as well as reconciliation between the non-IFRS financial measures and the most comparable IFRS financial measures. The non-IFRS financial information presented herein should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for operating income, net income or per share data prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nIC Power defines \"Adjusted EBITDA\" as for each period for each entity as net income, excluding net income from discontinued operations, net of tax (excluding dividends received from discontinued operations), before depreciation and amortization, finance expenses, net, income tax expense and asset write-off, and excluding share in income from associates, and negative goodwill. Adjusted EBITDA is not recognized under IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles as measures of financial performance and should not be considered as a substitute for net income or loss, cash flow from operations or other measures of operating performance or liquidity determined in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to represent funds available for dividends or other discretionary uses because those funds may be required for debt service, capital expenditures, working capital and other commitments and contingencies. Adjusted EBITDA presents limitations that impair its use as a measure of our profitability since it does not take into consideration certain costs and expenses that result from our business that could have a significant effect on our net income, such as financial expenses, taxes, depreciation, capital expenses and other related charges.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of IC Power's net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, and therefore this presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nSix Months Ended June 30,\nThree Months\nEnded June 30,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2015\n2014\n2015\n2014\n2014\n(in USD million)\nNet income for the period\n43\n79\n21\n16\n268\nDepreciation and amortization 1\n58\n51\n29\n28\n108\nFinancing expenses, net\n53\n67\n32\n45\n119\nIncome tax expense\n21\n31\n8\n14\n51\nAsset write-off\n-\n-\n-\n-\n35\nShare in income of associated companies\n-\n(2)\n-\n(1)\n(2)\nRecognized negative goodwill\n-\n(51) 2\n-\n(27) 2\n(71) 2\nNet income from discontinued operations, net of tax, excluding dividends received from discontinued operations 3\n-\n(7)\n-\n(1)\n(113)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n175\n168\n90\n74\n395\n1.

Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to represent funds available for dividends or other discretionary uses because those funds may be required for debt service, capital expenditures, working capital and other commitments and contingencies. Adjusted EBITDA presents limitations that impair its use as a measure of profitability since it does not take into consideration certain costs and expenses that result from each business that could have a significant effect on its net income, such as financing expenses, taxes, depreciation, capital expenses and other related charges.\nThe following tables set forth a reconciliation of net income from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA for our subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2014 :\nKallpa\nCDA\nSamay I\nOPC\nICPNH\nPuerto Quetzal\n(in millions of USD)\nNet income (i)\n50\n7 (ii)\n-\n71\n6\n(1)\nDepreciation and amortization\n46\n-\n-\n25\n8\n1\nFinance expenses, net\n35\n-\n-\n31\n7\n1\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n23\n(7)\n-\n26\n1\n2\nAdjusted EBITDA\n154\n0\n-\n153\n22\n3\n(i) Reflects net income after elimination and consolidation of adjustments.\n(ii) Non-operating income relating to swaps.\nNejapa\nCenérgica\nCOBEE\nCentral\nCardones\nColmito\n(in millions of USD)\nNet income (i)\n4\n2\n9\n(1)\n-\nDepreciation and amortization\n5\n1\n4\n4\n1\nFinance expenses, net\n-\n-\n4\n2\n1\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n2\n1\n2\n2\n-\nAdjusted EBITDA\n11\n4\n19\n7\n2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T18:23:34.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
