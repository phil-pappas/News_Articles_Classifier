The video is available on Visit Tampa Bay’s YouTube channel and through social media (#baycrafted).\n“We’re proud to see Tampa Bay’s craft brewers making a name for themselves and the region among their beer-loving peers,” said Santiago Corrada, president and CEO of Visit Tampa Bay. “Their work has its roots in Tampa Bay’s vibrant culture and unique heritage. At a time when travelers are looking for an authentic local experience, what could be more authentically Tampa Bay than our local craft beers?”\nVisit Tampa Bay is promoting the region’s growing craft beer business as part of this year’s in-state summer marketing campaign, which includes a highly interactive website designed to guide visitors through Tampa Bay’s myriad craft beer options. The campaign, supported locally by craft beer distributors Pepin Distributing Inc. and JJ Taylor Distributing Florida Inc., also includes advertising and events in the Orlando and Miami areas – all to drive home the message encapsulated by Coppertail brewmaster Casey Hughes: “I live in paradise and make beer. It’s the best job ever.”\nVisit Tampa Bay representatives will showcase the video at this year’s Beer Bloggers & Writers Conference in Asheville, N.C., July 17-19. The video, produced by St. Petersburg-based Treehouse Studio LLC, will be an early taste of what the group can expect when the conference comes to Tampa Bay in 2016.\nSource:- Visit Tampa Bay", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T14:15:42.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
