Luckily, this holiday itinerary cherry picks the unmissable sights and wraps them up in the wonderful 22-day Highlights of South America premium tour. You’ll spend two or three nights in most places so that you will never feel rushed. The tour has also been designed to minimise the effects of altitude by allowing you to acclimatise slowly, finishing with the highest-altitude Peruvian sights at the end of the tour. With a Brazilian barbecue in Rio and a lunch cooked in a Peruvian earth oven along the way, you will discover the tastes of South America as well as its culture and history. View Rio’s famous beaches, mountains and rainforest on a sunset cable car ride to Sugarloaf Mountain, and indulge in a Brazilian barbecue Such a comprehensive tour can be hard to organise independently, but APT has taken the stress away, leaving you to enjoy the trip in the company of a South American tour director throughout. Group sizes are small with no more than 40 guests and four-star accommodation is always in central or unique locations. Your adventure starts in Santiago, the Chilean capital, founded in 1541 and nestled in a valley surrounded by the Andes. Two nights are spent here in a hotel in the affluent neighbourhood of Vitacura. From here you will tour the city and take a day trip to the port once known as the Pearl of the Pacific. Valparaíso is a Unesco World Heritage Site thanks to its 100-year-old city funiculars and colourful painted houses. Here, you’ll visit the city’s historic centre and drive into the hills for a panoramic view of the city and its harbour. Power and glory: Iguassu Falls The next morning you fly to Buenos Aires for a three-night stay. A city tour will showcase the key sights, from the Casa Rosada government house, where Evita addressed the Peronists, to the Italian neighbourhood of La Boca, where vibrant houses were decorated with paint left over from the port. You will also enjoy a day to explore at your own pace. Dining experiences that celebrate the city’s culinary delights, from delicacies at the historic Café Tortoni to an authentic Argentine dinner and wonderful tango show, are also included in the price. It’s northwards next to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil’s ever-energetic city. View its famous beaches, mountains and rainforest on a sunset cable car ride to Sugarloaf Mountain. Indulge in a Brazilian barbecue as well as sampling the national cocktail, the Caipirinha. A selection of included tours will help you discover this amazing city, such as a trip to the famous 98ft-tall statue of Christ the Redeemer high above the city. Local colour: Peruvian children in traditional dress Next, it’s all about nature as you head south to the magnificent Iguassu Falls. Located on the border of Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay this spectacular location comprises 275 waterfalls and is surrounded by subtropical rainforest. You’ll ride the Rainforest Ecological Train to a series of walkways and viewing platforms and experience the sights and sounds of the falls from both the Brazilian and Argentine sides. Your next flight takes you to Peru, where you will overnight in Lima before continuing on to World Heritage site Cusco, once the Inca Empire capital. From here, you will make for the picturesque Sacred Valley for an insight into local life. Watch traditional weaving demonstrations and visit Munaychay, a special project that looks after abandoned children, where you will eat a traditional lunch cooked in a Peruvian earth oven. After a two-night stay, you will step aboard the Vistadome train to the Lost City of the Incas, Machu Picchu. Sitting some 8,000ft above sea level, it was built in 1450 at the height of the Inca Empire and lay unknown until US historian, Hiram Bingham, rediscovered it in 1911. Magical: Aranwa Sacred Valley hotel Today, it is among the most famous tourist sites in the world and you will have a special guided tour to learn about all its hidden secrets. Staying just a couple of miles from Machu Picchu, you can choose to revisit the ruins the next day before returning by train to Cusco for a two-night stay at the unforgettable Palacio del Inka. The next morning you will explore this beautiful city with its cobbled streets and layers of history – as seen at the sacred Inca site of Koricancha, which was covered by the elaborate baroque church of Santo Domingo. Later, enjoy an exquisite Peruvian dinner and traditional folklore show. The following day, travel by coach to Puno on the shore of Lake Titicaca – said to be the birthplace of the first Inca king, Manco Cápac. The highest navigable lake in the world at 12,500ft above sea level, Titicaca has more than 40 islands made from woven reeds which are home to the Uros people. Take a cruise around the islands, then step ashore to learn about their unique way of life. You’ll finish your tour in the city of Lima, where you will enjoy a guided tour of the historic centre before a farewell dinner at the very special Restaurant Huaca Pucllana. It is set within archeological ruins, making it the perfect spot to reflect on the incredible sights you have seen on your trip.
