It is a new online platform for travelers who are constantly looking for better ways to spend their money wisely. It helps traveling and booking their accommodation for the price they are happy to pay. \nWe are not always brave enough to call the hotel directly asking for a discount, most of us would not try to quiz the manager about possible bargains - it might be stressful and for sure will take a lot of time. \nAt RoomAuction.com holidaymakers and business travellers can bid for and book rooms at hotels of their choice for less than the standard, published rate – the offer is sent directly to the hotel via email. \nHow does it work? \n1. Let’s say you would like to stay at a chosen hotel for two nights, arriving this Sunday, double room. \n2. Let’s also say, that the double room rack rate is £90. You would see the rate and send your offer – for instance £65 per room per night. \n3. Hotelier will get your offer and will replay within a few hours - if the your offer is reasonable you will save £50, and hotel will sell additional room which could be left unsold otherwise – awesome feeling. \nBolesław Drapella, CEO of RoomAuction.com, comments: “We now have hotels offering from two to 465 bedrooms, rates from £25 to £255 per room, hotels from Scotland to Cornwall and Wales to East Anglia with meeting facilities from three to 3,500 delegates in one room! This provides a great level of flexibility to suit UK leisure and business travellers.” \nUsing the unique idea of RoomAuction.com, an affordable accommodation is just one click away, and its users can enjoy fantastic travel destinations for less and have more great memories to share. \nSee more at www.RoomAuction.com \nAbout RoomAuction.com Ltd: Established in 2003, but re-launched with a new business model in early 2015 site was already used by 15,000 guests offering to pay over £2,500,000.
