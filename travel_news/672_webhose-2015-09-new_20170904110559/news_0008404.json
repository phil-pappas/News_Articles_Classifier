As chief executive of Ikon Science, a company that provides geological and geophysical imaging systems to the upstream oil and gas industry, his hectic schedule takes in Mexico, Brazil, South Africa, Asia, Australia and the Middle East. On average, he says, he flies at least twice around the world each year. But rather than his regular airtime getting in the way of business, Mr Millwood Hargrave says it is essential to working well. “Part of the problem with being a chief executive these days is being bombarded with too much information,” he says. “A plane is a very protected space.” When he travels, he always books a window seat. “I will find myself looking out at Greenland or the Arctic, or seeing some of the mountains going east across Europe and I can just zone out. “It’s amazing how something that has been on your mind gets solved, just by staring out of the window at 36,000 feet. With a business involved in earth science, looking down on mountains and rivers can get you thinking quite creatively.” Mr Millwood Hargrave has been to Houston, oil capital of the world, several times this year and it’s the place he likes best. I will find myself looking out at Greenland or the Arctic, or seeing some of the mountains going east across Europe and I can just zone out “The weather is red hot but you just have to cope with that,” he says. A favourite haunt is the seafood restaurant at Houston Airport – another secret to how he makes business travel work in his favour. The restaurant’s bar is a phenomenal place to hobnob with some of the world’s most influential people, he says. “I’ve met politicians; I’ve met people who are travelling with Hillary Clinton. It’s great that you can network while looking at your gate.” For a business traveller, it’s little surprise that Mr Millwood Hargrave abides by the “marginal gains” method advocated by Sir Dave Brailsford, former performance director of British Cycling, which holds that tiny improvements in small matters add up to a larger gain. Just as the British cycling team does, he takes his own pillow when travelling. “If there was one thing I would advise anyone to do, that would be it,” he says. Marginal gains make sense. Business travel isn’t just about flying business class, says Mr Millwood Hargrave, but being professional about how you fly. “Because of the oil industry downturn we’ve gone across the board to cut costs,” he says. “It just means you have to plan things a little bit better, be a little more prepared, pack items for a bit more comfort and arrange things such as lounge access.” Along with his pillow and a smart jacket – “to make the right first impression” – he also packs running kit. “Wherever I am, I get up at 6.30am and go for a half-hour run. There’s a beautiful running track in Kuala Lumpur, for example, down near the Petronas Towers.” But he admits that beating jet lag means tough love. “I’ll do two or three miles in 30-degree weather, before a shower and breakfast.” He says. “You definitely know where you are by then.” • Find out more about how to receive business travel rewards by visiting British Airways On Business", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T17:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T12:39:58.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
