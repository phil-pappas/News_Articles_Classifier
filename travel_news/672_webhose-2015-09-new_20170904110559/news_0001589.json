Risks remain, particularly within the Eurozone, but the credit crunch and global recession of several years ago are now unpalatable memories more than immediate concerns. The UK, in particular, has been growing steadily since the recession, and after a period of hesitancy which followed, businesses have started to invest in growth once more. Today, a variety of economic indicators show that confidence is high and investment intentions are positive. It’s clear that there's a desire among small business owners to leave behind the monotony of filling in forms and basic administrative tasks The situation represents a big opportunity for small businesses to grow, by selling into these pockets of prosperity and developing sales channels to reflect increased demand in the economy. But new research from Canon that surveyed more than 1,000 SMEs indicates that they often feel restricted in their attempts to grow, facing challenges including identifying new business prospects, customer retention and too much time spent on admin. Solutions to these barriers of growth are complex and include closing the skills gap, embracing the cloud and digital technologies, and improving after-sales services. Think strategically: growth is a priority for everyone Photo: Getty But another factor playing a part in restricting businesses could be easier to solve. Businesses that are more efficient in dealing with operational processes will be able to devote more time to business development and customer retention. It’s a fact drawn out in research by Canon, the results of which emphasised SMEs’ priorities when it comes to slicker operations. Almost two-thirds of respondents said that efficiency was the biggest factor in their print hardware choices. As such, purchasing decisions were not just driven by the need to replace obsolete or faulty hardware, but also by a recognition that better technology means a better business. Companies following this path could reap benefits in the form of faster processes and more time devoted to growing the business. In the UK a variety of economic indicators show that confidence is high and investment intentions are positive Commenting on the findings, Mark Robinson, market business developer at Canon, said: “It’s clear that there is a desire among small business owners across Europe to leave behind the arduous monotony of filling in forms and basic administrative tasks, in order to concentrate on finding new customers and keeping existing ones happy.” Growth is a priority for all businesses, so it’s important to structure operations in such a way that takes effort away from process maintenance and towards customers. By investing in efficiency, business owners can achieve this coveted goal. Reap the benefits of workplace efficiency with Canon’s MAXIFY inkjet printer range.
