And then you put it in place and nobody uses it.\nIt's similar with a new bus service. I think it's the number 14 that goes from St John's all the way to Les Quennevais, via St Peters. It's not being utilised that much at the moment. It's something that people asked for, that's been provided, but it's not being used so we have to make sure that whatever we put into town - because it will be expensive even with volunteer drivers - has to be used.\n– Deputy Eddie Noel, Technical Services Minister Last updated Wed 16 Sep 2015 Travel Jersey", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T20:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T10:06:21.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
