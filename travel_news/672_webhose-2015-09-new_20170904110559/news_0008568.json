Expert Videos \nIf you're visiting Cape Town , this is the perfect way to spend your first day and get oriented to this delightful city. I book clients on a private \" Footsteps to Freedom \" tour all the time, because it's guided by incredibly charismatic guides, filled with enthusiasm and knowledge about the city. Garth in particular can draw amazing parallels to US and British history with South Africa's vibrant past, so everything you see just makes more sense. Being personally guided by a highly qualified guide with in-depth knowledge of all of Cape Town's major sights as well as the secret nooks and crannies only locals know about, is the way every tour should be! \nYour Day... \nYour guide would meet you at your Cape Town hotel and should start off by driving to Table Mountain for a cable car ride up. If you go early, you beat the crowds and hopefully get clear views before the \"tablecloth\" of clouds sets in! From Table Mountain you'll enjoy a 360° view to get the “lay of the land” and a brief walk-about tour at the top. Table Mountain is 1086m high and 3km long and located smack in the middle of town. It is one of the most iconic features of the city, and one of the mean reasons why Cape Town often ranks as \"the most beautiful city on earth\". On a clear morning, the views are spectacular, you can easily see Robben island from the top, as well as the many white-sand beaches and pretty bays that dot the coast. Table Mountain is also home to more than 1400 unique species of plants, several mammals and over 100 invertebrates. Watch out for the cute Dassies (Cape /Rock Hyraxes) among the rocks! \nIf you want to hike up Table Mountain , leave it for another day, It's a strenuous hike, you'll need to bring a guide with you for the first time up, and you want to factor in at least 3-4 hours to get up. \nUpon your descent, you would follow your guide on a stroll through Bo Kaap , the Cape Malay neighborhood with its rainbow-colored houses and cobble stone streets. Bo-Kaap was settled by the descendants of slaves brought over by the Dutch in the late 17th and 18th centuries. They originated from different parts of Southeast Asia, but were collectively referred to as \"Cape Malay\". Cape Malays were a mixture of political exiles, convicts, skilled craftsmen, artisans, scholars and religious leaders. The first South African Mosque was built in this area in 1794. After exploring the neighborhood, delve into the local cuisine and enjoy a quick & casual lunch at Biesmiellah Restaurant or Bo Kaap Kombuis (own account). \nContinuing your tour after lunch, you should visit sights such as the Grand Parade and City Hall, the Old Customs House, the Slave Tree site, Greenmarket Square , and the Company's Garden (named after the Dutch East India company who first founded a Cape Town in 1652 as provision station for their ships en route to India & back). This area is the historical, cultural and political heart of South Africa with Parliament, the office of the President, museums, galleries, memorials, statues and gardens. You may end the afternoon with a visit to the South African Museum and/or the Jewish Museum if time permits. Throughout the walk, your tour guide will be weaving stories around people like Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu, FW De Klerk (Nobel Peace Prize-winners), Winston Churchill, Gandhi and Cecil John Rhodes, while covering issues like colonialism, slavery, racial discrimination, war, diamonds and gold. There are some fascinating parallels to be drawn between US history and South African history, making this a very unique experience and why I like this tour so much. \nKeep in Mind... This is full day tour of Cape Town as described above. The Table Mountain Cableway is closed annually for maintenance (usually for 2 weeks in late July / early August), and does not operate when winds are too strong or cloud cover to dense. If this happens, your guide will let you know, and leave the cable car tickets with you to use on another day. If you would like to visit Robben Island , bear in mind that tours take ± 4 hours, so we recommend allowing an additional day in Cape Town for it, rather than trying to fit in the last ferry ride over at 3pm on this day. Tours runs every day of the week, four times a day or more depending on demand, Tickets need to pre-booked online . I suggest the 9:00 am departure, just in case bad weather disrupts or delays the ferry service. You will have the opportunity to change your ticket for a later departure (or in the case of total cancellation of services, having your money refunded). If you are interested in life in the local townships, I recommend a Vamos cycling tour for fun, or check out Uthando and head out to one of their projects. Andulela also offers excellent township tours with a bit of a difference.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T05:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T09:43:06.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
