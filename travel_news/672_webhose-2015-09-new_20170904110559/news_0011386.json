(AP) -- American Airlines is cutting flights from Pittsburgh International Airport to St. Louis and Hartford, Connecticut starting in November. Allegheny County Airport Authority spokesman Bobby Kerlik says the airport is hoping to find another carrier to serve those markets. The flights to Bradley International Airport in Hartford stop Nov. 4, and the Lambert-St. Louis International Airport flights will end Nov. 3. Kerlik says a national pilot shortage is to blame. Trans States, a regional carrier, operated the flights under the American Airlines banner. Trans States spokeswoman Stacey Ross says the airline looked at \"all of our American routes to determine which ones would have the least overall impact on American's system if they were discontinued.\" American Airlines is the Pittsburgh airport's largest carrier, accounting for more than 34 percent of passenger traffic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T21:26:00.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
