But where are the train-themed theme parks?!\nThankfully, Thomas knows it's time to get \"onboard.\"\nThomas Land is a theme park all about the world's friendliest locomotive, Thomas the Tank Engine. The wonderland opened this month as part of Edaville , a family amusement park less than an hour's drive from Cape Cod ... and while it's clearly designed to be kid-friendly, the park incites warm fuzzies of nostalgia in even the most stone-hearted adults.\nThomas Land currently features 10 adorable attractions starring Thomas and his friends, like a Cranky the Crane drop ride and a low-impact roller coaster resembling Toby the steam train. This is the only Thomas park in the U.S . -- other permanent Thomas parks exist only in Japan and the U.K.\nAll aboard!\nThomas isn't the only franchise getting its own park these days. Disney recently announced an upcoming addition of Star Wars Land to its parks in both California and Florida.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618", "http://michaelwtravels.boardingarea.com/2015/08/thomas-the-train-theme-park-opens-in-us/#sthash.Ie5afPND.PKocPTXJ.dpbs", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/14/cars-land-disney_n_1596916.html", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/09/diagon-alley-opening-reactions_n_5568217.html", "http://www.edaville.com/thomas-land/rides-attractions/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/20/abandoned-wizard-of-oz-theme-park_n_3784445.html", "http://www.edaville.com/", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBm9O45%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBm9GuC.img&description=ATHENA+IMAGE+-+Paul+Marotta+via+Getty+Images", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/star-wars-land-disney_55cfa3ace4b055a6dab08e42", "https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Cape+Cod,+MA/Edaville+USA,+5+Pine+St,+Carver,+MA+02330,+United+States/@41.8123211,-70.6770879,11z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89fb36eb9ac43937:0x268447ff6f1b72d5!2m2!1d-70.3209113!2d41.6990958!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e4bf80ca0dd911:0x8a4b64bde6e9ae3!2m2!1d-70.773968!2d41.845307!3e0", "http://www.edaville.com/thomas-land/", "http://www.frommers.com/trip-ideas/theme-park/americas-only-permanent-thomas-the-tank-engine-land-opens-images"], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T02:52:38.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
