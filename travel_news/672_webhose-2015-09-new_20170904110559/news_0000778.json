Well, pretty important, at least according to a new survey commissioned by tnooz . Looking at the web traffic of commercial airlines during the month of August, tnooz put together a list of the top 20 websites according to visits from U.S. web users. \nWhat’s immediately striking is that the size of an airline doesn’t always translate to website views — Delta is the world’s largest airline by passenger numbers, but comes in at No. 2 behind Southwest, which registered an astonishing 38,218,270 visits in August, a full 23.56% of the entire pie. That’s almost 20 million more than second-place Delta. However, this probably has something to do with the fact that Southwest does not list its prices on third-party websites. \nAirlines are working harder than ever to channel more people to their website instead of third-party sellers. In fact, some airlines, like Lufthansa, have begun charging for not purchasing a ticket on their website . Delta has removed its data from many third-party booking sites with the same goal. The numbers of this survey show that Southwest’s method of not listing with third-party sites can translate to getting more eyes on its site. \nHowever, unlike other airlines Southwest has been doing this for years, so it doesn’t risk alienating customers. The airline also has a very loyal following, thanks to its policies of not nickel-and-diming fliers with change and luggage fees. infographic by Tnooz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T23:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T05:49:54.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
