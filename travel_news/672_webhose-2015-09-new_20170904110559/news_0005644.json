For years since 9/11, families and friends of the victims of Flight 93 visited their loved ones' final resting place amid burn marks and downed trees. The crash site has now been transformed into a respectful place of remembrance and EarthCam donated its webcam technology and services, honoring the event with the release of its new time-lapse movie . To document the construction and preserve the footage for future generations, the National Park Service, National Park Foundation and Friends of Flight 93 partnered with EarthCam to record the entire process. Using time-lapse construction camera technology and high definition imagery, hundreds of thousands of megapixel photographs were captured from August 2010 to August 2015. EarthCam's in-house producers edited over 1,800 days of footage, creating a moving tribute for this beautiful memorial. \"The construction of the visitor center complex accentuates the national memorial's transformation over the years,\" said Keith Newlin, Deputy Superintendent of Western Pennsylvania Parks. \"Documenting these events allows our future visitors to witness this part of the memorial's history long after its completion. EarthCam's time-lapse composite of these events captures the thought and effort that has gone into creating a timeless place of reverence to honor the passengers and crew of Flight 93.\" Known for documenting the world's most significant memorials, EarthCam was honored to be chosen to archive construction of the Paul Murdoch-designed complex. The unique elements of the 6,809-square-foot visitor center, including hemlock patterns and coal tones, can be appreciated through the lens of EarthCam's high definition time-lapse camera. In addition to the Flight 93 National Memorial, EarthCam continues to document the rebuilding at the World Trade Center site. In 2001, just days after the attacks, EarthCam CEO & Founder, Brian Cury, personally installed the first camera to webcast the rescue and recovery for the world to see. Millions of photos of the rebuilding plus the original camera are a part of the National September 11 Memorial Museum collection.
