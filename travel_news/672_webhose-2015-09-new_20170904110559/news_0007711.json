During this time, the Dubai-based airline brought almost 1.5 million customers to the archipelago.\nEmirates started its operations to Seychelles with four weekly flights in 2005. Today, it operates a double-daily service. During the first year, Emirates carried 40,060 passengers to the country. In 2014, Emirates carried around 239, 000 passengers to the Seychelles; these came from more than 50 points around the globe.\nSpeaking at a gala dinner held at Avani Seychelles Barbarons Resort and Spa on 15 th September 2015, in the presence dignitaries as well as the travel trade, Oomar Ramtoola, Emirates’ Manager for Seychelles and the Indian Ocean islands, said: “Emirates has solidly contributed to facilitating trade between Seychelles and the rest of the world and supported the economy of the country in terms of generating revenue through leisure travelers. We are pleased to have been closely associated to the development of Seychelles over the last ten years.\n“What we are celebrating today is Emirates’ ten years of partnership with the Seychelles”, added Mr. Ramtoola. “Throughout the years, both parties have made renewed efforts to ensure that this partnership works. Indeed, it is a successful one.”\nSherin Naiken, Chief Executive Office of the Seychelles Tourism Board, also addressed the gathering. “We are indeed very grateful for the contribution made by Emirates towards the Seychelles Tourism Industry over the ten years, Emirates having been a dedicated partner of ours and having supported the industry during moments of difficulty. As we look to the future, we see more opportunities for the airline and for our tourism industry and we hope that we will have the chance to celebrate another decade of collaboration.”\nEmirates and the Government of Seychelles have signed an agreement which aims to jointly promote the destination across the airline’s global network. The two parties have engaged in the development of a series of joint activities to increase the visibility and awareness of the island in the 140+ destinations to which the airline flies.\nIn June this year, Emirates introduced the Emirates Boeing 777-300ER on the Seychelles route. This resulted in an increase in overall capacity by 1722 seats per week and has made the route an all-Boeing 777 operation.\nEmirates is a Seychelles-friendly employer. More than 70 Seychellois already work for Emirates, some of them are employed as cabin crew.\nDuring the gala dinner, Emirates Seychelles recognized the best performing travel and cargo agents for 2014-15. Sea Shell Travel won the awards for ‘Outstanding Overall Performance in Sales’ and ‘Outstanding Sales Performance in Premium Class’. Travel Plus received the award for ‘Outstanding Performance in Market Growth’.
