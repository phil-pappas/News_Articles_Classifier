Nobody was detained in the incident. \n\"Police received a threat notice warning of a bomb attack,\" spokesman Christian Altenhofen told The Associated Press. \"We ordered the plane back to Frankfurt, where it landed safely.\" \n\"It was a very specific threat and you have to keep in mind the date,\" he said, referring to the 14th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks. \"It made us take the threat seriously.\" \nRob Tobias, a passenger aboard Flight 902, said the captain announced about 15 minutes into the flight that it was turning around because of security concerns. \n\"Everyone calm and Frankfurt police and fire professional,\" he said in a message via Twitter. On the ground, \"all passengers and their luggage screened and swabbed for explosives. Also frisked. Passports also closely checked.\" \nAltenhofen said Friday's flight was canceled by the airline and has been rescheduled for Saturday. Police are continuing to investigate the source of the threat, which was sent by email, he said.
