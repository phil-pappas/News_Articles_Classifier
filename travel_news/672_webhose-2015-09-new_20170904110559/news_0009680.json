See Italy in shoulder season. “September and October are wonderful months on the Amalfi Coast and Capri,” says Andrea Grisdale of IC Bellagio . “Summer crowds are gone, and it’s warm enough to swim. Le Sirenuse is my favorite hotel in Positano.”\n2. Lock in next year’s safari. “The Great Migration of wildebeests and zebras starts in the Southern Serengeti in January, but it’s wise to book now since many seasonal camps have limited space,” says Rob Veden of Cox & Kings.\n3. Book your annual ski trip. “Reserve hotels for Presidents’ Day weekend or Spring Break now,” says Kay Merrill of Are We There Yet . Luxury resorts like Jackson Hole’s Teton Mountain Lodge & Spa and Park City’s Caledonian do sell out as the season approaches.\n4. Plan next September’s cruise. “Now’s the time to book New England and Canada sailings for next fall,” says Linda Allen of Cruises by Linda , because smaller ship lines (Crystal, Oceania) have only a few cabins available for these very popular itineraries.\n5. Think Caribbean Christmas. “There is still time to reserve a villa in St. Barts for the holidays,” says Peg Walsh of St. Barth Properties . “And with new villas just going on the market, we have additional inventory this year.”\nMore from Condé Nast Traveler:\nThe 2015 Friendliest and Unfriendliest Cities Around the World\n100 Top Hotels & Resorts in the World\n50 Things to Do in the U.S. Before You Die\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.cntraveler.com/contributors/peg-walsh?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2014-10-20/top-100-hotels-and-resorts-in-the-world-rca-2014?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://www.cntraveler.com/contributors/kay-merrill?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2015-06-27/things-to-do-in-america-all-50-us-states?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://www.cntraveler.com/contributors/andrea-grisdale?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2015-08-14/the-2015-friendliest-and-unfriendliest-cities-in-the-world?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://www.cntraveler.com/contributors/linda-allen?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://www.cntraveler.com/?mbid=synd_msn", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fAAdVEYe%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fAAdVzvl.img&description=Courtesy+Le+Sirenuse"], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T12:11:58.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
