I’m confident the team will make it a firm favourite in the city.” A city where visitors are welcomed with a warm hug and a wee dram, ibis Styles Glasgow Centre George Square is adorned with more than a few wry icons of Glasgow. Inspiration has been taken from the Duke of Wellington statue sporting the obligatory traffic cone atop his head, local hero Billy Connolly’s outrageous big banana boot and Glasgow’s proud industrial past. Style meets substance, with bold design features and subtle touches throughout the hotel. Walk along the corridor and you are transported down memory lane as the carpet detail comes alive with quotations from the local shipyard works. Weaved within them is the beloved rose emblem, a subtle nod to the world-renowned Glaswegian architect, designer and artist Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Once checked in at the industrial-inspired lobby, guests will be greeted in their room by a digital print headboard featuring iconic images of the city and traffic cone lights. There are also stencilled crane illustrations in the bathroom mirrors and on the bedrooms walls, giving the impression the TV is suspended from a height. ibis Styles Glasgow Centre George Square is the perfect place to kick back, relax and enjoy the fun filled personality that radiates from this dynamic, Glasgow-inspired hotel, after a day exploring the great city itself.
