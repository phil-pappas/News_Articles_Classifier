Head Chef Etienne Forget and his talented brigade have been working hard to achieve this highly sought after accolade following the introduction of its new menu earlier this year, focusing on home-made Great British favourites, using locally sourced ingredients. \nFrench chef Etienne has headed up the team at The Acorn since 2003. Speaking about the award, he said “I am extremely proud of our achievement. We are a close knit team striving to deliver culinary excellence in every dish, so it’s great to see this recognised”. So what would the Head Chef recommend? “My favourite starter has to be the Crab and King Prawn Fish Cakes, which we serve with a mango salsa and fresh coriander. Our steaks are ever popular, with a choice of sides and marinades. But the one dish every diner must try is our Bitter Chocolate Torte, with passion fruit sorbet and salted caramel sauce”. Mercure Bristol North, The Grange Hotel is a 19th century manor house set in 18 acres of landscaped gardens. Diners can soak up the atmosphere in the elegantly-styled Acorn Restaurant and enjoy inspiring views over the surrounding countryside. To compliment the award-winning dishes are a selection fine wines. From Australian whites to Italian reds, there is something to suit every palate.
