This week more than 25,000 gaming professionals have first access to one of the industry's most anticipated video slot machines in recent years-a successor to the popular Konami Podium™ cabinet. Featuring dual 27-inch high-definition touch screen monitors along with enhanced KP3+™ platform processing power, a 19.5-inch video topper, and a proprietary new DynamicDash™ button panel, Konami's Concerto was designed to incorporate specific customer feedback and is characterized by its ability to attract and entertain casino patrons.\n\"The new Concerto cabinet is essentially a collection of multi-sensory components harmoniously blended together to create a player experience that is both memorable and entertaining. That was the spirit behind the name Concerto,\" said Matt Reback , vice president, marketing at Konami. \"Among our customers, however, it will quickly become even more strongly associated with the magnetic performance and player attraction that operators ultimately appreciate.\"\nOne of the machine's most striking details is its signature holographic side lighting feature, to grab attention from every angle. Lying just outside the game screens, the lighting is programmed to interact uniquely with different events-bonus features, win celebrations, attract mode, and more. The machine's new KP3+ platform allows each native game theme, such as Radiant Queen™ and Fortune Stacks™, to carry unique art and design features to each of the machine's interactive display elements, for a greater level of engagement and entertainment.\n\"Our KP3+ Concerto games leverage the dual 27-inch screens with larger-than-life art and animation unlike anything before. Everything flows and interacts from the video topper, to the digital button panel, to the holographic side lighting; really leveraging the KP3+ platform in the best way possible,\" said Reback. \"At the same time, we designed Concerto so that operators can place their proven KP3 top performers like Dragon's Law and China Shores on this exciting new cabinet, so it represents the perfect combination of innovation and proven performance.\"\nAttendees are encouraged to visit booth number 1154 at the Sands Expo & Convention Center from September 29 through October 1, 2015 to explore Concerto and other new Konami releases.
