The city living experts will take visitors on a virtual journey to London, Paris or Berlin, all from the comfort of a full-sized studio apartment set up near the Eurostar. There will also be the opportunity for visitors to win stays in their apart’hotel properties all across Europe. \nThe capsule, which will also visit Gare du Nord in Paris, will show customers what they can expect to find when staying at a Citadines property, including contemporary design, living and working spaces and a kitchen. It will demonstrate what guests will experience, whether they are staying for a night, a week or a year. Citadines will be using this opportunity to educate visitors on how best to immerse themselves in the city life of London, Paris or Berlin via a giant screen and headset within the capsule. This will include tips from local bloggers, giving advice on little known places to visit and the best places to eat off the tourist track. There will be a chance to play a virtual apart’hotel-themed game. One lucky player will win a three night stay at any European property and ten others will win a weekend stay at a Citadines Apart’hotel in Europe of their choice. All visitors will also receive a London themed culinary treat after they have visited the studio. Nancy Faure, vice president of marketing sales, Citadines Europe, said: “We want to spread the word to potential new customers about our concept, hospitality, personalised service and the contemporary design of our apartments. To achieve this, we decided to go directly to the two main thoroughfares in Europe, Gare du Nord in Paris and St Pancras in London to host our Travel Capsule and demonstrate our new generation of product. The Paris station is the busiest in Europe with 180 million passengers annually, 32 million heading towards the north of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Great Britain. In London, 45 million travellers use St Pancras station each year. With the Travel Capsule we are going to meet travellers and invite them to participate in a unique and memorable experience with many prizes including stays in Europe. It is a fun and original way to educate our future customers.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T02:41:26.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
