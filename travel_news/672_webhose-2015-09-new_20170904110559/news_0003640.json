The study's findings which garnered over 800 respondents across 25 sectors of the ship building industry were then analyzed and compiled into a report titled \" State of China Shipyard and Marine Equipment Industries \".\nThe purpose of the study is to gain a better understanding of the current state of the maritime industry within Asia and specifically in China as to provide key players and the community insights towards future decisions. The research dives into the major areas of ship building, propulsion systems, electrical systems, auxiliary machinery, port technology, and offshore activities. The study examines the current production and opinions of each area as well as future planned investments and target markets. This 30+ page report is available free of charge to all pre-registered professionals to Marintec China 2015 which takes place1-4 December at the Shanghai New International Expo Centre, Shanghai, China .\nSeatrade and Marintec China embarked on this collaborative project in early 2015 in consideration of Seatrade's renowned industry knowledge and editorial objectivity combined with Marintec China's extensive access to and deep relationships with the Chinese marine, shipbuilding, and naval communities. A comprehensive survey was design by both groups to include and query the most pressing issues facing supply & demand, manufacturing, business growth, outlier influencers, as well as near future planned activities for the industry in China. The results yielded a respondent rate of over 800 of which the majority of participants stem from the manufacturer and supply segment (43.7%). shipyards and professionals from the shipbuilder segment (14.6%), and ship repair (15%).\nThe report's analysis was then translated into English alongside charts, graphs, and executive summaries and commentary per each major sector covered in the research including: shipyards/shipbuilding, electrical systems/equipment industry, ports/port technologies, auxiliary equipment and machinery, and of course an extensive section on the offshore industry. An excerpt of the study's shipyard/shipbuilding section notes: \"The shift in the product mix towards offshore could be clearly seen in which sectors of shipping respondents saw the most demand for newbuildings. In terms of where demand was for newbuildings, 41% said offshore support vessels, while 36% said offshore rigsâ€¦.\"\n\"Marintec China had wanted to field such a study for some time now and after UBM's acquisition of Seatrade Global, partners who we had already been working with for years, we now became an extension of each other's teams making this type collaboration more fluid and possible\" says Marintec China Event Director Stella Fung . \"Our intent is to make available this information prior to Marintec China 2015 so that international audiences can make the best use of business opportunities they might not be fully aware. For example, it is common understanding that the fluctuations in oil prices has affected activities for the offshore sector, however many suppliers or potential suppliers of shipbuilding may not be aware as to how far the extent and demand is today for eco-ship building.\"\nTo learn more about Marintec China 2015 - Asia's Largest Maritime Trade Fair organised by UBM Asia and the Shanghai Society of Naval Architects and Ocean Engineers (SSNAOE) - including activities, conference seminars, exhibiting companies and how to obtain a complimentary electronic copy of State of China Shipyard and Marine Equipment Industries 2015 visit www.marintecchina.com\nAbout UBM Asia\nOwned by UBM plc listed on the London Stock Exchange, UBM Asia is the largest trade show organiser in Asia and the largest commercial organiser in China , India and Malaysia .
