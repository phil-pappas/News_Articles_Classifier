Amtrak traffic between Washington and New York City was shut down for six days as a result.\nFoxx said the investigation being launched on Friday comes after Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut contacted the Obama administration about his concerns.\n\"There were a flurry of concerns raised in the wake of the accident in Philadelphia,\" Foxx said.\nHe said letters were sent to the four air carriers requesting information. He did not say how long the investigation would take.\n(Reporting by Richard Cowan; Editing by Bill Trott and Doina Chiacu)\n ", "external_links": ["http://syndication.ap.org/AP.Distro.Feed/GetFeed.aspx?idList=37895&amp;idListType=products&amp;fullContent=true&amp;showMemberBodyTemp=true&amp;format=4&amp;maxItems=10&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img.s-msn.com/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyxle.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Dashcam", "http://img.s-msn.com/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyxle.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Florida", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;travelnews&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&qu", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAdjkAm.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA42Hq5.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Feds", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAdlWvc.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BBkkQsl&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Texas", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAdms8r.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BBkkQsl&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;A", "http://img.s-msn.com/tenant/amp/entityid/AA2oHEB.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Are", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAdr2zy.img&quot;}}", "http://www.reuters.com/"], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T12:44:49.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
