While many people agreed that it looked unappetising, others jumped to the defence of the iconic ice cream and chocolate snack and praised McDonalds for being generous with the amount of chocolate on top.\nThe photo has been retweeted nearly 10,000 times.\nMeanwhile, it seems the treat has a lot of fans and it can be hard to live up to their high expectations!\nCannot believe my mum just bought the dog her own McFlurry \"so she doesn't feel left out\"\n— Darc (@darcmcdermott) July 12, 2015\nI got a free McFlurry. This is the best day ever\n— Nemisis (@NemisisWickie) July 12, 2015 It’s not the first time food has sparked heated debate online. Earlier this month a man shared a photo of a stingy bacon and egg roll on Reddit , which contained what could be the world’s smallest portions inside a seemingly unbuttered lump of bread.\nYou call that a sandwich? Source: Supplied\nAlso this month, a cake of the popular Frozen character Elsa was mocked mercilessly , before it was discovered that the cake was actually baked by a company that makes goodies for families impacted by the critical illness of a child.\nYes, the Elsa on the right bears little resemblance to the one on the left ... but it’s a dessert people!
