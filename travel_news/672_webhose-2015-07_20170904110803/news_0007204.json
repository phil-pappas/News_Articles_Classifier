In ancient times, some cultures believed that sneezing was a sign of a devil exiting the body. When Odysseus's wife hears her son sneeze in The Odyssey , she interprets it as a sign that her husband will come home safely. In Japan , a sneeze indicates that someone is speaking well of you somewhere.\nThe verbal blessings bestowed upon sneezers are often attributed to the 6th century pope Gregory the Great, who invoked \"God bless you\" as protection against the bubonic plague that was raging through Europe at the time. However, while an American sneeze is likely to garner a blessing, other cultures respond to a snot rocket differently. Here are six international alternatives to \"bless you.\"\n1. \"Health!\" The common German-language response to sneezing, \"Gesundheit! \", simply means \"health.\" \"Gesundheit\" came into American vernacular by way of German-speaking immigrants. Other languages have equivalent exhortations, like the Spanish \"Salud!\" or the Maltese \" Evviva !\" The Russian version is a more forceful \"be healthy.\"\n2. \"Live long and prosper.\" The full Turkish response to a sneeze is straight out of Star Trek : it means \"live long and prosper,\" though it's often shortened just to \"live long.\" The response literally translates to \"you see it, too.\"\n3. \"God smother you!\" A common Portuguese response to sneezing is \"Santinho!\", or \"Little saint!\" However, you may also hear \"Deus te abafe,\" a phrase that roughly means \"God smother you!\" (It's translated by some as \"May God put a blanket over you,\" which is a far better thing to imagine.)\n4. \"To your wishes!\" In French, it's polite to express a hope that all your sneezy companion's wishes come true. The French version of bless you, \" Ã tes souhaits ,\" means \"to your wishes.\" A second sneeze is greeted with \"A tes amours, \" or \"to your loves.\"\n5. \"The weather will be nice tomorrow!\" After the first two sneezes, the Dutch welcome a third sneeze with the phrase, \"Morgen mooi weer!\" or \"The weather will be nice tomorrow!\"\n6. \"Grow!\" In his 1976 ethnography of Zulu culture, author Axel-Ivar Berglund reports that \"of a man who sneezes, it is said \"Thuthuka.\" Or, inother words, \" grow .\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.microsoft-ice.com/amp/document/editor/AAdlcjh/version/2", "http://mentalfloss.com/", "https://www.academia.edu/249838/Reply_to_Sneezing_in_Jewish_Tradition_Intercultural_Parallels", "http://french.about.com/od/vocabulary/a/atessouhaits.htm", "https://www.howtosayinturkish.com/contents/bless-you/", "http://www.asahikawa-tourism.com/asahikawa/interesting/superstitions3.html", "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5435812", "http://journals.rcni.com/doi/full/10.7748/ns.29.30.27.s26", "http://www.linguanaut.com/english_maltese.htm", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fAAdlcjh%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fAAdkZgm.img&description=6+Responses+to+Sneezes+From+Around+the+World+-+iStock", "http://europeisnotdead.com/audio/sounds-of-europe/european-sneeze/"], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T09:38:11.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
