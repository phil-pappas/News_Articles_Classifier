I wouldn’t do that to the boys\n“At the time it was just, ‘Righto, you’re going to have to give it away and stay home with the boys and be a dad’, and that was the most important thing, and I was all right with that.\n“Obviously the outcome, Audrey is all right now and it’s a lot better. It’s great that she’s healthy again.\n“But yeah, that was pretty rough there for a while, thinking about everything, the boys not growing up with their mum, me not playing golf anymore, not having a wife.\n“It was just everything. Unfortunately it probably happens every day to people around the world. We were just really lucky that she’s on the mend.”\nLeishman said he would dedicate an Open victory to his wife.\n“Obviously it would be massive,” he said. “That’s the goal now. Today the goal was to shoot a good round and get myself so I had a chance tomorrow (Monday AEST).\n“It would be great to get a hold of that trophy and nice to take it back for Audrey and the boys.\n“But there’s obviously a lot that has to happen between now and Monday night to do that.
