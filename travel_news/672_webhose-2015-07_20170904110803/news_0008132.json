If you want to book a private jet, most companies hope you simply know which service you want to use and choose them. But startup JetSmarter is looking to change the process for such customers. The Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based company, which just secured $20 million in Series B funding from Jay Z , the Saudi royal family, and others, aims to gather and give easy access to prices and plane availability for more than 800 private flight providers nationwide , as TechCrunch described. But its business doesn’t end there. As the post also described, JetSmarter also aims to serve frequent fliers by offering a $9,000-per-year package that promises unlimited trips from a set of pre-purchased flights. On the surface, the pitch for that level is pretty clear: Do you pay $9,000 per year to fly commercial? Why not fly private? Business Insider spoke to founder Sergey Petrossov, and quoted him expressing frustration with the the process of booking private flights, \"I kept thinking to myself, 'Why hasn't this service been brought into the digital world?'\" At the moment, that report noted, JetSmarter has several tiers of service. JetDeals offer one-way flights at economy levels, JetShuttle is for first-class seating, and JetCharter is for people who want to book their own custom itineraries. According to the company’s web site, JetDeals and JetShuttle seats are available for free to paid subscribers , and the company also offers complimentary helicopter service to and from New York-area airports. \nWant New York Technology news in your inbox?
