Epicurean playground \nBring on the celebrity chefs and the master cooks, artisan purveyors and sustainability pros, local farmers and area fishermen, Sunset magazine’s own experts and the region’s best brewmasters for a long weekend of tasting, exploring and education. The main event takes the shape of a giant food-and-drink tasting at the historic Santa Margarita Ranch, with 100-plus producers, demos and tours. \nSunset Savor the Central Coast, Sept. 24-27, Santa Margarita Ranch, 9000 Yerba Buena Ave., Santa Margarita, (805) 540-3214, www.savorcentralcoast.com . \n2. Zip lines \nin the vines \nThis would qualify as an adventurous wine pairing. Margarita Adventures does zip-line canopy tours in partnership with Ancient Peaks winery on the northern boundary of SLO wine country. Fridays during the summer, they even offer “night tours” starting at 7:30 p.m. One of the five zip lines covers 1,800 feet, soaring over a mountain forest before zooming over a Pinot Noir vineyard. \nMargarita Adventures, 22719 El Camino Real, Santa Margarita, (805) 438-3120, www.margarita-adventures.com. \n3. Apples in Avila \nThe Avila Apple Trail connects seven farms and ranches with one user-friendly tour during the September-to-December apple season. It includes stops at Kelsey See Canyon Vineyards, which does dynamic wines in addition to hard ciders. A bonus: The town of Avila celebrates its apple heritage with the two-day Avila Apple Festival in September. \nAvila Apple Trail, www. avilavalleyappletrail.com ; Avila Apple Festival, Sept. 20, www.avilaapplefestival.com. \n4. Wine festival \non the water \nIts wineries are an average of just 5 miles from the ocean, so setting SLO wine country’s signature harvest season event next to the Pacific makes sense. Nov. 7, local wineries and chefs alike converge at Avila Beach Resort for the Grand Tasting and Wine Auction as part of the larger Harvest on the Coast weekend celebration. Food and wine from more than 60 establishments star on Saturday. Friday, Nov. 6, is the Collaborative Winemaker Dinner. Sunday, Nov. 8, those who attended Saturday’s Grand Tasting can take their ticket for complimentary tastings at wineries throughout the area. \nHarvest on the Coast, Nov. 6-8, tickets start at $125, www.slowine.com/events/harvest-celebration.php. \n6. Adventurous Alsatians \nFormer German studies Professors Claiborne Thompson and Fredericka Churchill started Claiborne & Churchill in 1981 to honor their taste for Alsatian varietals. They’re now well positioned to welcome in widening wine audiences seeking atypical aromatics. Zocker Gruner Veltliner, Tangent Albarino, Clesi Pinot Grigio and Sinor Pinot Gris reinforce the area’s ability to lead on the frontier of edgy and interesting white wine, but if you’ve got just one stop to make for mineral-rich whites, make it Claiborne & Churchill and try the dry Rieslings, Gewurztraminers and rosés. \n2649 Carpenter Canyon Road, San Luis Obispo, (805) 544-4066, www.claibornechurchill.com. \n7. Live music \nand peacocks \nKelsey See Canyon Winery’s creekside lawns are always bordered by an indoor-outdoor wine-and-cider-tasting bar and home to roaming wild peacocks. On summertime Sundays from 1:30 to 4:30 p.m., lawns fill with music lovers — who often bring their pooches and picnic fixings — tuning into everything from live Hawaiian to folk to bluegrass. Rotating foodstuffs like wood-fired pizza complement the decorated lineup of wines, as does the distinctive coastal art in the tasting room. \nKelsey See Canyon Vineyards, 1947 See Canyon Road, San Luis Obispo, (805) 595-9700, www.kelseywine.com. \n8. Pink buildings and beer \nBetween the unique, wildly colorful and strangely themed guest rooms, rock bathrooms and bands playing every night, there is no shortage of reasons to visit the iconic Madonna Inn. But here’s a good one nevertheless: an Oktoberfest celebration anchored by nearby pioneers in beer Firestone Walker Brewing Co., with live polka, classic rock, hearty German food, commemorative steins and lots of lederhosen. As one promotion puts it, “Oompah at its best.” \nOktoberfest 2015, Oct. 2-3, Madonna Expo Center, 100 Madonna Road, San Luis Obispo, (805) 543-3000, www.madonnainn.com. \n9. Delicious history \nSextant Wines occupies a beautiful old general-store-style spot in historic Old Edna, the former town center that locals still jokingly call the area’s “urban hub.” Vintage bicycles decorate one tall outdoor wall over a welcoming porch available for wine tasting, though the sleek square tasting bar inside is tough to resist. Nearby Babydoll sheep, who are in charge of weed-eating, are the only thing cuter than the historic barn and adorable vintage cottages available for vacation rentals or private parties. The best part, though, would be the wine, particularly the Sextant Windemere Premier Cuvee Pinot and X-Series Syrah, sourced both on the property and from the family’s Paso Robles vineyards. \nSextant Wines, 1653 Old Price Canyon Road, San Luis Obispo, (805) 542-0133, www.sextantwines.com. \n10. Professional home brew \nThe nonprofit Central Coast Brewers Consortium and its breweries tap a tribute to the homemade beers that helped launch their careers Aug. 22. Fifteen members like Bang the Drum Brewery, SLO Brew and Tap It Brewing Co. revisit an original or inspirational recipe from their home-brewing days and brew it exclusively for this “Garage Brews Revisited” event, and pour a current signature brew to bring palates from past to present. \nCCBC Garage Brews Revisited, 1-4 p.m. Aug. 22, 1234 Broad St., San Luis Obispo, www.ccbrewers.org. \nMark C. Anderson is a freelance writer. E-mail: travel@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @Monterey.MCA \n5. Picnic pairings \nPaul Doering and Sophie Boban-Doering loved the sidewalk cafes’ Champagnes, the boulangeries’ just-baked breads and the poissonneries’ fresh fish, but it was Paris’ cheeses they couldn’t stop thinking about after they returned home to San Luis Obispo. The cravings ultimately birthed the area’s newest and most definitive European cheese palace. \nBoban-Doering works closely with importers to curate the most seductive cheeses from Italy, Switzerland, France, England, Scotland — while stocking Oregon, Vermont, Indiana and California cheeses too — plus charcuteries, pâtés, imported mustards and local honeys. . \nBoban-Doering highlights three pairings perfect for summer picnics. \nFromagerie Sophie, 1129 Garden St., San Luis Obispo, (805) 503-0805, www.fromageriesophie.com \nHarbourne Blue , a pasteurized goat’s milk blue cheese from Sharpham Barton, South Devon, in southwestern England, with Claiborne & Churchill’s Dry Gewurztraminer . The wine pulls out the sweetness in the cheese, and the cheese highlights the wine’s white peach and grapefruit character. “This pairing is the warm sun to me,” she says. “A vacation in my mind.” \nLangres , a pasteurized cow’s milk cheese from the Champagne region of France, with Kenneth Volk Vineyards’ 2011 Santa Barbara County Pinot Noir . Volk’s 2011 Pinot Noir becomes jammy with plum notes and, Boban-Doering adds, “finishes with a spiciness that hugs the springy texture of the cheese.” \nTomme Périgourdine Affinée , a delicious, creamy pasteurized goat’s milk cheese from the Perigord region of France, presents the scent of nuts and mushrooms and a long, tangy and clean finish to go with Niner Wine Estates 2012 Twisted Spurheart Hill Vineyard Estate Reserve blend of Petit Verdot, Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. “You are in heaven.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T03:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T18:13:17.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
