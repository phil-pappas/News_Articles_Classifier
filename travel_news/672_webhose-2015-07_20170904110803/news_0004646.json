(Operator instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chris Stent, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Stent, you may begin. Kevin Ozan (CFO): Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook; and Chief Financial Officer Kevin Ozan. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by phone, webcast and podcast. Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are our reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. And now I would like to turn it over to Steve. Steve Easterbrook (President, CEO): Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. In May, I shared the initial steps we're taking to fundamentally reset McDonald's business and reassert our leadership. Today, I will share the progress we've made since then. Our turnaround plan represents a significant step change for McDonald's and establishes the foundation for our transformation as we work toward becoming a modern progressive burger Company. Our number one priority is to return critical markets to sustainable growth by regaining customers' trust and loyalty. These efforts must be led by the markets, local management and franchisees working together to deliver what people want from McDonald's , great tasting, quality food at a value, delivered with a better service each and every time they visit. Our focus over the last several months has been execution, transformation, and challenging the organization to evolve more quickly, taking bold steps to change the way we think and operate starting first with our structure. We've made a fundamental shift in the way our business is organized effective July 1 to eliminate redundancies, maximize talent, and create a greater sense of urgency amongst Company and operator leadership staff, as well as with our suppliers. This restructure arguably represented the biggest organizational change in our history. Yet from inception to execution, we completed it in just two months. It required significant change inside the Company and we are already realizing some of the benefits; stronger discipline, sharper customer focus, and more acute sense of urgency, and a deeper understanding of what legacy thinking and actions to challenge and how. For example, market teams in Australia and Hong Kong have recognized and acted upon the need to offer greater choice and personalization with our hallmark product, burgers. They are aggressively deploying elements of experience in the future and seeing encouraging results. In Germany, our brand relaunch highlighting new taste and a better overall restaurant experience is giving customers reasons to think differently about McDonald's . We've also recruited fresh outside perspectives as part of this restructure. Our new Chief Communications Officer, Robert Gibbs, and Chief Operating Marketing Officer, Silvia Lagnado, are highly respected, talented leaders who will bring a wealth of experience and outside perspective For the next several months, we are taking further action and reasserting our leadership. We must operate better restaurants. That is why we are recommitting to operations excellence which, frankly, has been lacking in some markets. Simply speaking, we need to be better at serving hot, fresh food, providing faster friendly service in a contemporary restaurant at the value of McDonald's . Today, I will highlight the steps we are taking and the progress we have made. While our financial results remain disappointing in the second quarter we are seeing early signs of momentum. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect positive global comparable sales led by growth in our newly created international lead market segment and China's continuing recovery from the 2014 APMEA supplier issue. 1 of 13", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T04:21:20.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
