In addition, fellow non-executives Ruth Markland and Paul Skinner will leave by the end of the year. \nWinters is keen to put his own stamp on the emerging markets bank, which, although still very profitable, has delivered diminishing returns of late. The former co-head of JP Morgan’s investment bank and former member of Sir John Vickers’ independent commission on banking, Winters spent the month before his official start date fact-finding on what went wrong for Sands. \nAlthough, as banking turnarounds go, his job at Standard Chartered (Other OTC: SCBFF - news ) is more one of fine tuning rather than radical change, he was rightly keen to work out how the bank operates and where the problems were. \nBill Winters \nA considered businessman, Winters was not one to rush into wholesale changes on arrival. His note to staff on his first official day pinpointed the recent disappointing performance, admitting the company had “made mistakes”. He also set analysts and investors wondering whether a rights issue may be in the offing, given his comments that he would review “all aspects of our capital strength”. \nSince that missive, however, Winters has managed to keep himself largely off the radar, until he chose to announce, at 7pm on Sunday night, wholesale changes to the way the bank is run . Eight regional divisions have been cut to four, and the bosses of each will report to Winters. He is also taking control of direct reporting from the bank’s big three businesses - investment, retail and commercial banking. \nMike Rees, the bank’s deputy chief executive, previously had responsibility for all three divisions. Instead, Rees is left with brand and marketing, working on “key clients”, and advising Winters on strategy. Rees has gone from day-to-day management of the bank’s key operations to what could be viewed as a senior advisory role. \nThere are obvious reasons for this. Winters is the new man in town, and wants to take control. Rees was given the prize of overseeing the three arms in the fallout from much admired chief financial officer Richard Meddings’ surprise departure in January 2014, with Sands keener to focus, it seemed, on wider matters. Although Sands took the fall for the bank’s problems, Rees, a 25-year veteran of the bank, has to take some of the responsibility. \nInsiders suggest that if Winters had wanted Rees to go now, this would have been the obvious opportunity for him to do so. But they emphasise that given the amount of institutional knowledge that has been lost with the various personnel changes, it is important he stays around, at least in the short term. \nThe weekend’s announcement saves Rees for now. It gives him a role, and allows it not to look like he is being pushed out. But although the bank’s advisers would deny this, in truth, if he were not before, the latest shake-up at the bank’s Basinghall Avenue headquarters firmly places Rees in the departure lounge. \nThe question is simply a matter of when, rather than if, he chooses to depart. \n= Betting on change = \nAfter news of talks between bookmakers Ladbrokes (LSE: LAD.L - news ) and Coral leaked last month, many in the industry were somewhat incredulous as to how the merger might actually work. \nWith 4,000 betting shops between the FTSE 250 constituent and its private equity rival, analysts questioned how many the pair would be forced to sell. Those 4,000 shops are equal to 45pc of the 8,700 bookmakers in the UK. Given competition regulators like to push companies down to an approximate 30pc share in such situations, the impact of a tricky ruling from the Competition and Markets Authority could have the potential to dilute the many benefits of the deal. \nBut when the duo outline their merger in full sources indicate the offer will be announced later this week it is expected both management teams will make a solid push for digital betting to be included in the regulatory mix. \nJust as the banking industry is trying to convince the competition regulator that it is not all about high street branches, a fight it slowly seems to be winning, so these two leading lights of the gaming industry will urge the regulator that the betting market is far more than just traditional, brick and mortar betting shops. \nOne other facet of the deal which was much speculated on last month was the role of Andy Hornby, Gala Coral’s chief operating officer. \nAlthough Hornby, who was chief executive of HBOS at the time of its emergency takeover by Lloyds at the height of the financial crisis, will retain a senior management role in the enlarged company, he will not, I understand, join the main board. \nWhich, given both sides are keen to remove as many hurdles as possible from the merger, is probably very wise. \njames.quinn@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T03:20:31.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
