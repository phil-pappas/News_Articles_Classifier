Blue | Bloomberg South Florida's Uber supporters — including business owners and some of the tourists that the region spends so many dollars to attract — were quick to blast their disappointment on social media platforms about the ride-sharing service's departure from Broward County as of July 31. \"Just when you think your city is taking strides in the right direction they take 10 steps backwards,\" Marc Falsetto , co-founder of JEY Hospitality in Fort Lauderdale and owner of popular concepts like Rok:Brgr and Public House, wrote on Instagram. \"They keep this up I'm moving to LA or New York.\" Read his full post among the compiled social media reactions below. Falsetto wasn't immediately available for further comment to the South Florida Business Journal. Related Content 5 things to know, and where not to use Uber Since Uber's expansion to Broward County in August, the taxi alternative has, at least, made traveling around South Florida easier for passengers among Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport's 12.3 million arrivals last year, and Port Everglades' 4 million cruisers in 2014. Seemingly unaware of the news announced Monday, one Twitter user asked Uber whether there will be rides available from Broward County's port. See his post below. The missing amenity may be a glaring issue for tourists from bigger cities that are used to Uber, having to instead utilize the region's outdated taxi service (some cabs still don't accept credit cards.) Uber has launched in 57 countries and hundreds of U.S. cities. The company hasn't said it will stop service in Miami, and will still drop travelers to Broward County after July 31, but not pick them up. \"This is a lose-lose situation for citizens and tourists of Broward County,\" tweeted Pete Vazquez, a Fort Lauderdale resident. See his full in the slideshow.
