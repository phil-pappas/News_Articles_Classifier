And if the thought of four weeks away from grey British weather isn’t enough to tempt you, here are eight very good reasons to head south to escape the gloom. 1. The weather In November, the average daily high in the Costa del Sol and the Algarve is about 20C. At the same time in London, it’s just 12C – and a shivering 9C in Manchester. Reckon on a lot more sun and a lot less drizzle, too, down on Europe’s coasts. Even from December to February, the south of Spain and Portugal can be very mild. You may need a jacket in the evening, but during the day the sun on your face warms your spirit as much as your skin. 2. A real holiday An extended winter break is not just a chance to escape the UK’s weather. It’s an opportunity to explore a region without the crowds. Many people prefer the southern shores of Europe without the blistering heat and bustle of summer. The countryside remains green, the golf courses are in their prime and a trip into a city presents the ideal opportunity for checking out the shops and museums. In the evenings, you can cook up a treat in your apartment with fresh regional produce or dig into a pile of seafood at a local restaurant. With four weeks to play with, you won’t feel rushed to cram in everything. That’s a real holiday. 3. Lower cost of living With the euro at much lower levels against the pound than in the recent past, sterling goes further in Spain and Portugal. In fact, Portugal is one of the cheapest places in Europe for a holiday and you’ll be amazed at what a feast you can have for less than £15. Spain is not much more expensive. And all those bargain bottles of wine and liqueurs lining the shelves of the local stores? With your own car, you can bring back as many as you like (and check out the duty-free bargains on the Brittany Ferries cruise-ferry, too). 4. Freedom There are plenty of flights to southern Europe in winter, but to make the most of your trip you will need to rent a car - which can be costly over four weeks - and you’ll be severely restricted on luggage, unless you stump up an excess fee. Book your extended sojourn through Brittany Ferries and you’ll have the freedom of having your own vehicle with you and no limits on how much you can pack. The golf clubs, the walking boots, the books, the laptop, clothes for all eventualities – and why not take the bikes on a rack, too? After all, the weather may well be perfect for cycling. 5. Quality accommodation Booking through Brittany Ferries, you’ll know the apartment waiting for you in Spain, Portugal or France will have been carefully assessed. Your accommodation complex will have on-site management, usually a swimming pool and be close to shops, restaurants and places of interest, making it the ideal base for a leisurely stay. The one- and two-bedroom apartments have well-equipped kitchens, including washing machine, plus home entertainment such as satellite television. A regular cleaning and linen service is also included, so you get to avoid those household chores. 6. A memorable journey Getting to your holiday destination in the south is all part of the holiday. After a relaxed and enjoyable overnight cruise from Portsmouth or Plymouth to Santander or Bilbao, you can take your time to reach your accommodation. You could use the motorways to get south as quickly as possible, but why not ask Brittany Ferries to book hotels en route, perhaps a luxurious Parador, and break the journey over two or three days? That way, you can devise a route that takes in dramatic countryside and medieval towns. For an altogether shorter journey, but with equally beautiful landscapes, why not sail from Portsmouth, Plymouth or Poole to one of five ports in northern France, then snake your way down to the glamorous Côte d’Azur. 7. The heating bills While you may want to leave your central heating on its lowest setting while you’re away, the cost of your fuel bill will be much lower than if you were huddled by a radiator at home. Most of the accommodation offered by Brittany Ferries comes with utility bills included, so even if you do need to pop the heating on for an hour, it won’t cost you any extra. 8. Terrific value With prices from just £539pp for a four-week holiday, Brittany Ferries’ extended winter sun holidays are a bargain. Don’t forget that price includes the cruise-ferry crossing, with accommodation in an en-suite cabin when travelling to Spain, and four weeks in a quality serviced apartment. There’s also the financial protection that comes with booking a holiday as a package.
