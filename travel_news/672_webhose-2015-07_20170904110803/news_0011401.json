When there are six guests, the farm is “full”. “If it was up to me I would delete [Little Corn] from the map,” says Paola, her beloved English mastiff and Great Dane keeping watch by her feet. “The more people [that come] the worse our life will be. But you can’t stop development.”\nLittle Corn has changed a lot since Carminiani arrived, but as a first-time visitor I had to pinch myself upon seeing that such an unspoilt Caribbean island still endures. From the “lighthouse” (a lookout on the highest point of the island) there are no bloated all-inclusive resorts obstructing the view, nor is the birdsong interrupted by traffic noise — because Little Corn has neither cars nor roads. In the distance a handful of restaurants and a small village are clustered around a crescent of golden sand, but otherwise it’s all verdant jungle and azure seas.\nNicaragua is fast emerging as an exciting travel destination thanks to its imposing volcanoes, diverse wildlife, pretty colonial towns and excellent surfing. But Little Corn is still off the beaten track and its ethnic mix is markedly different from the mainland. The 1,000-odd inhabitants are mostly black Creole, rather than Hispanic, and they speak a range of languages including Creole, English, Spanish and Miskito. The vibe is cool, unhurried and relaxed.\nLike the rest of Nicaragua’s storied Miskito Coast, this island was once a haven for British and Dutch pirates. Little Corn became a British protectorate in the 17th century before reverting to Nicaraguan rule in 1894.\nOffbeat reggae rhythms echo in the village from simple green, blue and pink corrugated iron-roofed homes. Chickens and dogs roam unencumbered and children play pick-up basketball.\nThere isn’t much to do on Little Corn but that is part of its charm. Laze in a hammock, gorge on cheap lobster, plantain chips and coconut bread, kayak, fish and dive and you have pretty much completed the list.\nLiving out a castaway fantasy here is simple. The island never feels crowded and at its more remote reaches it is not uncommon to have an entire golden cove to oneself.\nBefitting a place that frowns upon motorised transport, I hitch a morning ride on the Capt’n Maike, a traditional Miskite sailboat. A five-strong crew sailed the hand-carved 40ft vessel to Little Corn from their home near Puerto Cabezas on the Miskito Coast, navigating only by the stars.\nIn brisk winds they sit precariously upon a long wooden plank extended out over the water for balance. “Tomorrow I’ll teach you how to sail it,” says crew member Giovanni with a smile.\nLittle Corn’s population began to fill out around a decade ago, but until recently most of the tourists were hardy backpackers who slept in cheap and basic wooden cabanas on the beach.\nThese gap-year kids still congregate each sundown at the Tranquilo café in the village to watch the paddle-boarders out in the bay, to fill up on two-for-one cocktails, cheeseburgers and fish tacos, and to tell tales of the barracudas, stingrays and turtles they’ve seen that day at the reef.\nBut in 2013, the opening of a 16-cabana luxury yoga resort and spa called Yemaya at the northern tip of Little Corn began to draw a new wealthy, health-conscious clientele to the island. Yemaya’s cabanas overlook lush, undulating lawns and the island’s best beach.\nEach boasts crisp linen, mahogany furniture, a huge bathroom and private terrace. A smoothie bar whips up nourishing concoctions throughout the day — the $8 Lean Green Machine features green tea, yoghurt, coconut, cashews, honey and cinnamon — and in the evening guests dine barefoot on coconut lobster, rack of lamb and plum-glazed duck breast.\nAt around $400 a night, Yemaya marks a radical departure for a poor island where the minimum wage is about $5 a day. The bartender received a $150 tip during one shift and the concierge took home $800 in gratuities for one month’s work. The resort now employs roughly 10 per cent of the island’s residents.\n“Now you see a lot more smartphones, bicycles and new snapback [baseball] hats . . . Everybody is making more money as our guests also go to the village and spend,” says Michael Bitton, the manager.\nSetting up a luxury resort in such a remote location was a challenge, he concedes. “Most of our staff weren’t literate, a lot of them couldn’t sign their own name . . . Not only had they never worked in a hotel — they’d never been to a hotel, nor sat down in a nice restaurant,” he says. “But the loyalty and genuine love they have . . . and language skills, are amazing.”\nLittle Corn islanders are a friendly yet superstitious bunch. The lights must go on before sundown, as this is when the ghosts are said to come by; sudden changes of temperature — taking something from the oven and then going to the refrigerator — are to be avoided.\nWhen the resort entertained the idea of shipping a decorative Buddha to the island, pious locals went down to the port to protest. The statue wasn’t allowed ashore.\nNicholas Martinez, 23, grew up in nearby Bluefields on Nicaragua’s Miskito Coast. He has a lanky frame, kindly demeanour and a wisp of fluffy beard. Training to be a yoga instructor, he helps out with the classes at Yemaya which take place under a huge open-air palapa pavilion in the jungle. Some villagers accused him of trying to summon the devil through his practice, but he is slowly winning them over; many of Yemaya’s staff do yoga before their shifts.\n“Yoga gives me a release in my body and my mind — it takes away all my problems,” he says.\nYoga is not yet the biggest sporting draw on the island. The jungle path from Yemaya to the village crosses a baseball diamond, from where young players hope one day to be scouted, backed by several rows of bleacher seating.\nLobster fishing was once the predominant industry on Little Corn but overfishing has vastly depleted stocks and now only five boats serve these waters, a fraction of the old 60-strong fleet. Tourism is therefore the last big hope for a better standard of living, but could Little Corn’s charms could be ruined by too much development?\nI sit for a glass of water with a member of the communal government — known to all simply as “Mr Rory” — whose silver moustache and glasses lend him an air of seen-it-all wisdom.\n“People used to live more together. Development is good but it brings a lot of change. People get independent,” he reflects. “People come here saying they want to build a house to live in but they live in it for one week and rent it for six months . . . so we said that’s got to stop . . . But we’re not trying to close it off, we can’t do that as this island lives off tourism now.”\nThere are reasons to hope that Little Corn will not become yet another expensive, identikit Caribbean bolt-hole. Due to its small size, the island’s fresh drinking water supplies and refuse collection facilities are already under strain, and there is also a limited supply of land.\nBut the biggest barrier to mass tourism is the journey required to get here. Visitors must take a one-hour flight from the capital Managua to Big Corn, Little Corn’s larger and more developed sister island. Then they must take a 40-minute ride in a panga — a small, open-top boat with a motor attached.\nPassengers are obliged to wear life jackets — for good reason. On the beach at sundown I run into Barry and Wendy (they did not provide their surnames), who recount a particularly horrendous crossing in January. Hailing from Chatham, Cape Cod, where they work in the shellfish industry, they have been coming to Little Corn for seven years but say this panga trip was the worst yet. “There were 10 to 12ft seas. We had water up to our knees and were taking waves right into the boat,” says Wendy. Several passengers vomited when they finally made landfall.\nYemaya has launched its own private panga service to provide guests with greater comfort and convenience, but it can’t fix the capricious seas. “If it was easy to access, the island would be overcrowded,” says Bitton.\nBack down the beach, at Farm Peace & Love, where fragrant cinnamon and ylang-ylang trees rustle in the breeze, Paola Carminiani and her dogs are keeping a watchful eye over her beloved island. “It’s a paradise here — we have a quality of life that not even a millionaire can buy. I just hope it is maintained — it’s very fragile.”\nDetails Chris Bryant was a guest of Yemaya . Double rooms cost from $330 per night. Cottages at Farm Peace & Love cost from $90 a day. Flights from Managua to Big Corn island are from $182 return with La Consteña airlines\nPhotographs: Chris Bryant; Alamy\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.littlecornhotel.com/", "http://www.ft.com/", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fAAd9iaE%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fAAd98pG.img&description=The+Yemaya+Island+Hideaway+on+Little+Corn+Island+-+Provided+by+Financial+Times"], "published": "2015-07-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T04:04:39.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
