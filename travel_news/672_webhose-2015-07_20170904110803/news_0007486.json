From the cultural north, to the island beaches topped off with the vibrant city of Bangkok - the four groups will have so much to share, they’ll be Thailand experts by the end of the trip.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T13:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T16:36:08.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
