Vienna’s ten top markets in the first half of 2015 were Germany with 1,283,000 bed nights (+ six per cent more than the same period in 2014), followed by Austria (1,243,000, + seven per cent), the USA (348,000, + nine per cent), Italy (328,000, +13 per cent), and United Kingdom (237,000, +11 per cent). Places 6 to 10 were taken by Russia (217,000, -32 per cent), Switzerland (209,000, +12 per cent), France (165,000, – two per cent), Spain (156,000, +16 per cent) and Japan (127,000, – two per cent).\nVienna also reported particularly strong growth compared to 2014 from South Korea (86,000 overnights, +29 per cent), Serbia (79,000, +25 per cent), Turkey (71,000, +28%), India (40,000, +41 per cent) and Taiwan (36,000, +57 per cent).\nDespite the expansion of Vienna’s hotel accommodation between June 2014 and June 2015 – an increase of 3,700 to 63,800 beds- room occupancy rose from 65 per cent to 66 per cent over the same period.\nNorbert Kettner , director, Vienna Tourist Board said, “Vienna demonstrated its tourist attraction in the first half of 2015 with an increase of 5.4 per cent to some 6,330,000 visitor overnights. International overnights account for more than 80 per cent of Vienna’s total volume of overnights. This not only reflects Vienna’s continued attractiveness, but also shows that our systematic internationalisation strategy of diversifying into many different markets is paying off.”\nVienna’s target is to reach 18 million overnights by the year 2020.\n 11:22 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T18:22:26.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
