Wall Street interests and Republicans in Congress fiercely opposed the agency.

They also argue that it should not be headed by just one person and that President Barack Obama illegally appointed the agency’s director, Richard Cordray, during a congressional recess. Cordray was later confirmed by the Senate. \nA three-judge panel of the appeals court said those arguments could proceed. Judge Brett Kavanaugh said the bank did not have to intentionally violate the law in order to launch a constitutional challenge. \nBut Kavanaugh said the bank could not challenge the constitutionality of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, created by the financial overhaul law to designate certain financial companies deemed “too big to fail” for additional regulatory oversight. \nThe court also rejected the bank’s challenge to part of the law that allows the Treasury secretary to order liquidation of a failing financial company that poses a risk to the financial stability of the U.S. government. \nThe government has argued that the bureau’s structure and powers are constitutional.
