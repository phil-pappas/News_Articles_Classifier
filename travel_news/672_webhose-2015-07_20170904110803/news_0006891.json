It currently handles more than 30,000 passengers a year. \nThe cruise operator’s strong performance under Bridgepoint has been due to a number of factos, including increasing and upgrading the capacity of the fleet by 11%, geographical expansion of sales offices and the acquisition of sales distribution channel TDI. \nJean-Emmanuel Sauvée, co-Founder and president of Ponant, said: “We have worked well with Bridgepoint during a period of expansion for our business. \n“In the last three years we have introduced our specialist luxury cruises to new customers, launched new ships and grown our business significantly. \n“Today, we are entering a new period with a similar shareholder who shares our vision and ambition for Ponant within specialist luxury cruise market.” \nXavier Robert, partner of Bridgepoint in Paris, added: “The transformation and progress achieved by the company have been outstanding and we are proud to have worked with the management team and contributed to its success. \n“The planned transaction ensures the continuity of the company’s ambitions with the acquisition of our interests by a likeminded long-term shareholder.” \nThe transaction is subject to standard Works Council and other EU clearances.
