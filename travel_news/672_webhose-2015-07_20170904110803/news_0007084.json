I saw the weather clearing so jumped in my campervan and hit the road for a four-hour drive to start my run by midday. The trail is not technical and so even a novice would be able to tackle it, but it is strenuous, so adjusting expected completion time according to experience would be smart. As a bonus, the trail also includes Mt. Snowdon, the highest mountain in Wales. I have found very few people are aware of how stunning the Snowdonia ranges are! After travelling the northern hemisphere for over a year, Snowdonia National Park goes down as a \"glad I didn't miss it\" memory and an area I hope to return to one day. \nHorse Shoe Bend, one of the stops in a three-month road trip of the US. \nOn the shore of Lake Tekapo, while cooking breakfast, I captured this photo of my girlfriend Abbie in the snow, watching the sunrise. \nThe photo captures Sherpa children playing in the Thame Valley, Sagarmatha National Park. I was trekking with my partner for a month in the national parks of Nepal. The dramatic landscape is a photographer's dream and the warm people make it a truly amazing experience. Unfortunately, it is these communities who were majorly affected by the recent earthquakes. \nSan Fransisco's Haight Ashbury - the home of The Grateful Dead and a super-hip suburb that loves to surprise. When I saw these legs, my only response was to capture the scene so I hope \"she\" didn't need any help! (Sorry, I don't know her name...) \nCarly and Jasmine overlooking our \"glamping\" huts in the Moroccan Sahara Desert, which was part of a camel safari near Merzouga. Awesome! \nDuring my recent 49-day tour of Europe I visited the stunning cliff-top monasteries at Meteora in Greece. Slightly off the beaten tourist track, this was one of the more tranquil and stunning places I visited. You could take the time to sit on a cliff edge (literally, there's no barriers here!) and just soak up the atmosphere. \nOn our trip to Italy, we made an effort to see an outdoor opera. We went to the opening night of Aida in the Arena Verona - a spectacular arena to see a even more spectacular opera. The colour, the props, the sound - all utterly magnificent. Glad to have ticked this one off the ol' bucket list... \nDos Palmas Island Resort and Spa - one of the most beautiful and relaxing places we have visited in the Philippines. \n29 days, four countries. Sailing through the Mediterranean. A coach tour around Italy. What earth-shattering beauty there is in our world! And I was lucky enough to experience it all. I could leave the long-haul flights (sardines in a can come to mind), but the end result of discovering some of Europe's most idyllic places was worth it. From the chaos of Athens to the serenity of the Tuscan countryside, my heart skipped a beat with every new experience. But I was reminded by many people who had toured NZ how lucky I am to live in such an idyllic place. I have brought back some wonderful memories, many beautiful pieces of art and, of course, heaps of photos. I loved my great adventure and feel blessed to call NZ home. 1 of 10 « Previous « Previous Next » Next » \nThis week's travel photo entries take us glamping in the Sahara Desert and trail running in the mountains of Wales. \nDo you have a holiday snap that you'd like to share with the world?
