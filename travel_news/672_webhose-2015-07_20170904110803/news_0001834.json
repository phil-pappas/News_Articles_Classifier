It's home to artwork dedicated to black culture.\nThelma Golden, its curator, says the 47-year-old museum has outgrown the space.\nIt's currently housed in a 1914 building that has air conditioners droning in galleries. Currently, the museum has to shut down when it changes exhibitions because it's so disruptive to operations.\nNew York City is contributing $35.3 million to the project and the Ford Foundation is kicking in $3 million. The rest will be raised from other sources.\nConstruction is due to begin in 2017 and be completed by 2019.\n___\nInformation from: The New York Times, http://www.nytimes.com\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T17:41:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
