It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton . Please go ahead, Jessica. Jessica Hansen (VP - IR): Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to our call to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of FY15. Before we get started, today's call may include comments that constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For your convenience, this morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.DRHorton.com and we plan to file our 10-Q later today. After the conclusion of the call, we will post updated supplementary historical data on the presentations section of our Investor Relations site for your reference. This supplementary information, which we encourage you to review, includes historical data on gross margins, changes in active selling communities, product mix and our mortgage operations. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David Auld (President, CEO): Thank you, Jessica and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I am pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our D.R. Horton team delivered an outstanding third quarter. Our pre-tax income increased to $334 million on $3 billion of revenues. And our pre-tax margin improved 330 basis points to 11.3%. Our sales and fortunes continue to improve during the quarter as our homes sold increased by 22% from a year ago, on only a slight increase in active selling communities. This reflects strong performance in our core D.R. Horton communities and the growth of our Emerald Homes and Express Homes brands, which have enabled us to expand our product offerings and our industry-leading market share. Our continued strategic focus is to leverage our operating platform to produce double digit growth in both revenue and pre-tax profits while generating positive cash flows and increasing our returns. During the third quarter, we generated $357 million of positive cash flow from operations. With the sales backlog of 12,761 homes at the end of June, solid sales trends in July and a well-stocked supply of land, lots and homes, we are well-positioned to finish our year strong and have an even stronger 2016. Mike? Mike Murray (EVP, COO): Net income for the third quarter increased 96% to $221 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, compared to $113 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 94%, to $334 million in the third quarter, compared to $132 million in the year ago quarter. And home building pre-tax income increased 90% to $302 million, compared to $159 million in the prior year quarter. 1 of 14", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T01:23:30.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
