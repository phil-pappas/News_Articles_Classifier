With its new cloud-native Itesso Enterprise Lodging System (Itesso ELS), the company is leading the industry towards a new generation of property management solutions. Itesso also currently provides PMS technology to 1,800 properties worldwide.\nThis deal brings Amadeus closer to its vision of bringing together systems known today as Central Reservation Systems (CRS), Property Management Systems (PMS), Revenue Management Systems (RMS), Sales & Catering and others, into a cloud-based community model platform which is fully centered around the guest experience.\nThis will enable the simplicity of a tightly integrated solution which shares data from all primary hotel applications to give a single view of the guest, and full visibility and control of the business across brands, groups and properties. Customers can subscribe to the full offering, or individual applications for specific use cases, which can plug into hotel proprietary or third party systems – all backed by award-winning customer service and an ‘easy-to-do-business-with’ mentality.\nAmadeus believes the industry is ready to adopt this model, and the integration of the cloud-native Itesso ELS accelerates our delivery against this vision and promise. This acquisition marks another step in Amadeus’ path to deliver on its commitment in the hotel IT sector following its acquisition of Newmarket, the US-based groups and events specialist in 2013, and solidified by its agreement to work with InterContinental Hotel Group to develop a next generation GRS (Guest Reservation System).\n“Property management technology is a critical component of our strategy and we assessed numerous options to extend our capabilities in this area,” said Paco Perez-Lozao, Senior Vice President of New Businesses at Amadeus. “It was critical that we found a company with the right expertise that was focused on customer success and shared our vision. We believe we have a great cultural fit with Itesso. Their technology stands out, and as a cloud-native PMS can be tightly integrated with our overall offering.”\nAs a result of the transaction, all of Itesso’s employees, which number approximately 100, including the management team, are expected to move to Amadeus bringing complementary hospitality and property management expertise built up over 20 years. “The team and I are delighted to become part of Amadeus,” said Bas Blommaart, Managing Director of Itesso. He continued, “Integrating the Itesso ELS as a key module of Amadeus’ cloud-based platform for the hotel industry opens up a whole new spectrum of possibilities for our customers – current and future.”\n“A lot of hotels and chains are facing important and challenging decisions over the modernization of their IT platforms,” said Jeff Hiscox, CEO of Newmarket, an Amadeus company. “We’re committed to working with the industry to address these opportunities and meet their needs. The acquisition of Itesso helps us build and deliver solutions which will offer unprecedented visibility, control and functionality to hoteliers so they can provide a simply great experience to their guests.”\nTags: amadeus , Central Reservation Systems (CRS) , GRS (Guest Reservation System) , Itesso , Property Management Systems (PMS) , Revenue Management Systems (RMS)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T10:47:44.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
