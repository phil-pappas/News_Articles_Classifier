Also, a collection of Cowshed products will be available in many of the carrier’s United Club locations and other lounges. Since its founding in London in 1995 as a private members’ club, Soho House has expanded to include Houses across Europe and North America, as well as restaurants, cinemas, spas and hotels, with Condé Nast Traveler naming Soho House Chicago to its 2015 list of the hottest hotels. Lauded by Cosmopolitan magazine UK as a “super-stylish beauty brand,” all of Cowshed’s award-winning products are made in England from the best in organic, wildcrafted and fairly traded plant extracts and essential oils. United customers will enjoy formulations inspired by the scents of an English country garden, with playful names designed to lift spirits and relax travelers. “Soho House’s Cowshed skin-care products – which received very positive feedback from customers and flight attendants – will be a fresh addition to the products and services we offer premium-cabin customers on United Airlines,” said Tom O’Toole, United’s senior vice president and chief marketing officer. “This is another step in enhancing our customers’ experience in flight and on the ground.” “This marks an exciting time for Cowshed. We are very proud of our humble beginnings in the English countryside more than 16 years ago and are looking forward to sharing Cowshed products with United passengers around the world,” said Nick Jones, founder and CEO of Soho House & Co.
