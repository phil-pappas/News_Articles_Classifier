Thankfully, help is at hand. This spring, Labour demonstrated its seriousness about immigration by selling mugs emblazoned with the phrase CONTROLS ON IMMIGRATION . At the time, these mugs were mocked by commentators; some even called them racist. Lazily, the commentators had failed to read the instructions. For the benefit of those who haven’t already ordered their mug, I reproduce Labour’s guidance below. \"If you spot a migrant in your home, simply trap it under your CONTROLS ON IMMIGRATION mug, as with a spider.\" \"Now slide a postcard underneath. It is common for migrants to lose one or two legs in this process, but please be assured that they do not suffer.\" \"Carry your mug to the nearest window. Now release the migrant into the garden or yard below.\" \"If you suffer from a phobia of migrants, enlist a family member to dispose of the migrant on your behalf.\" This (sometimes) charming man Irrespective of how his music sells, Morrissey will always be with us. Every couple of weeks or so, he wafts back into the news with his latest complaint or theory. On Wednesday, he alleged he’d been sexually assaulted at San Francisco airport by a security officer, who “groped my penis and testicles”. A spokesman for the airport said they reviewed the CCTV footage and saw nothing untoward. I’ve been a fan of Morrissey and his former band The Smiths since I was 15, and was lucky enough to interview him once, in 2011. It was an experience. One moment, he would be droll, conspiratorial, almost even cheerful – the Morrissey you’d always hoped to find. The next moment, without obvious cause, he would stiffen, frostily, as if offended. A moment later, all charm again. It made it impossible to know quite what to make of him. Maybe that was the point. The man himself - by turns charming and frosty (Photo: Reuters) Regardless of what he may be like as a person – which I doubt anyone, even his family, really knows – he remains the most extraordinary pop star this country has seen. I suspect, however, that he’ll have to die before we realise. The three stooges A curious fact I learnt this week about the 1955 election. That year, the seat of Anglesey was a three-horse race. The candidates’ names? Hughes (Lab), Hughes (Lib) and Hughes (Con). All unrelated. One can only imagine the dire warnings from the rival camps (“Go to bed with Hughes, wake up with Hughes”), but in the end the result was clear. Hughes won, with Hughes second, and Hughes a disappointing third. Hughes – the Labour Hughes, that is – held the seat until 1979. In 1964, he beat Jones (Con), Jones (Lib) and Jones (Plaid Cymru). @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T21:39:38.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
