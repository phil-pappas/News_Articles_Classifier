For visitors to the Milan Expo, they need travel no further than the China Pavilion to get a taste of classic China culture, or a bit of contemporary charm. Peking Opera, acrobatics and lion dances in the auditorium; plates of Beijing Roast Duck in the exhibition hall, which was designed like a traditional Chinese canteen; and, of course, a full performance of Marco Polo. And that’s just what was organised for Beijing Week. Until the close of the expo, on October 31, the pavilion will focus on 16 Chinese provinces and municipalities, dedicating a week or day of celebrations to each. “Beijing Week covers a wide range of activities with various themes, ranging from agriculture to food safety, to fully display the glamour of the city,” said Wang Jinzhen, commissioner-general of the China Pavilion. The Chinese capital took centre stage for seven days on May 30. Along with the cultural attractions, organisers held a business forum to help Beijing companies connect with potential European partners as well as promoted the city’s bid to stage the 2022 Winter Olympics. Beijing Week covers a wide range of activities with various themes, ranging from agriculture to food safety, to fully display the glamour of the city Part of the pavilion was also given over to a horticultural display, to give people a glimpse of what to expect when Beijing’s Yanqing county stages the 2019 International Horticultural Expo. And the fun was not confined to the pavilion. Artistic performances, as well as presentations on tourism and fashion, were held at venues throughout the expo garden. “We’re here to make sure Beijing shines at the expo, to deepen mutual understanding and boost people-to-people exchanges,” Li Wei, secretary- general of the Beijing municipal government, said at the ceremony to launch Beijing Week. As a city with a history of 3,000 years, including 862 as the nation’s capital, he said the city boasted a unique blend of rich traditions and modern vitality. “Beijing is open to global communication, and it will strengthen co-operation with cities around the world in various areas, including economics, technology and culture,” Mr Li said. “We’re eager to work closely with other cities, and we hope our friends from around the world will continue to support our development.” Officials behind the city’s Winter Olympics bid will also be hoping the expo can help take them past the finish line. In the pavilion’s landscape garden was a photo exhibition of the potential Games venues in the capital and partner city Zhang jiakou in Hebei province, as well as China’s most celebrated athletes. Beijing Week coincided with the city receiving a positive assessment in a report from the International Olympic Committee’s evaluation commission. Evaluation teams visited both Beijing and rival bidder Almaty, in Kakhstan, this year. The IOC was to announce the host city in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on July 31. “The entire population of Beijing has participated with great enthusiasm toward our candidacy to stage the 2022 Winter Olympic Games, and it is fully prepared for the event,” said Xiong Jiuling, chairwoman of CCPIT Beijing, a group that promotes Chinese international economic interests. Stefano Gatti, general manager of participants for the Milan Expo, said he believes Beijing is a strong candidate for the Games, “considering the expertise it has developed by hosting high-level international events”. The city had the right climate and a mountainous environment perfect for the Winter Olympics, and “all the means to provide the infrastructure and transport systems that are the real challenge for such a big event”, he said. “The Milan Expo is the right place for Beijing to promote its bid,” he added.
