Both have pleaded not guilty.\nThai police and prosecutors say forensic evidence strongly points towards the two 22-year-old suspects with both men's DNA found on or inside the body of Witheridge.\nBut the defence claims the men have been scapegoated by an under pressure police force who bungled their investigation and coerced confessions from the pair which they later retracted.\nThey had asked trial judges on the island of Koh Samui to independently retest all the police's DNA samples. On Friday the court ruled that they could do so.\nBut there was confusion about which samples left in police possession were still in a suitable state for retesting - particularly the crucial swabs taken from Miller and Witheridge's bodies.\nLead defence lawyer Nakhon Chomphuchart told AFP on Sunday that only a handful of items found near the crime scene can be re-examined.\nIt is not clear how useful a re-test on the available items will prove to either side. A witness testified to removing and washing down the garden hoe when he came across it shortly after the holidaymakers' bodies were found.\n\"The Court order means no possible retest on DNA samples from Hannah and David's bodies,\" Andy Hall, a Thailand-based British rights activist who has raised money for the accused and advises their legal team, told AFP.\n\"Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo (Win Zaw Tun) now have no chance to retest crucial Thailand based forensic evidence implicating them in the crimes they are charged of,\" he said, adding that the integrity of the police investigation\"has been seriously undermined\" by the lack of retestable samples.\nHowever, Hall said the team plan to introduce evidence at the trial which was obtained in Britain which they say contradicts the prosecution's case.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T14:12:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
