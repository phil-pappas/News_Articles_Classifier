Some of you have already reached, and passed that magic number (whoa!). Several of you are making fantastic progress (despite exams, shifting homes and everyday distractions). And to all those who've just begun: Welcome! So, what have you been reading? Something picked randomly off the bestseller list? That hyped-up award winner? The new publishing phenomenon everyone's talking about? Part 3 of a trilogy you feel obliged to complete? The same-old classics you've been hearing about for decades?Yawn!There's so much more to great reading - undiscovered gems from a different era, surprisingly good reads from a genre you've never tried, stories from lesser-known writers just waiting to captivate you. So we got book lovers from varied walks of life to recommend what you should read next - no self-help titles, no populist fiction, no well-known classics, no big new releases.It didn't go quite as planned. Some people just couldn't commit to a single book; they bombarded us with three, sometimes four, picks. Others called us back, days later, to gleefully change their choice to something better. One greedily wanted to know which books had been mentioned so she could start reading them. (We didn't tell her!) But everyone we spoke to spent time picking the unusual books they'd read, loved and remembered well. \nUncommon Wisdom by Fritjof Capra Uncommon Wisdom: Conversations with Remarkable People challenges our limits and understanding of the many ideas that we think are fundamental to our existence. The writer talks to physicists, philosophers, economists and politicians and offers us deep insights. His conversation with Werner Heisenberg, Alan Watts and J Krishnamurti in [the chapters] \"Howling with the Wolves\" and with Gregory Bateson in \"The Pattern Which Connects\" are my favourite parts of the book. BONUS: You should also read The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera. I am reading it for the tenth time probably, and I just can't stop myself from picking it up again. The effortlessness of the master writer to dwell on the extremes of tragedy and comedy in this extraordinary work is amazing. If you have not already tried it, then I say it's a must-read. \nMyra Breckinridge by Gore Vidal I was going to recommend Franny and Zooey by JD Salinger but I think I'll go with something even more unusual - Myra Breckinridge by Gore Vidal. It's the most inappropriate book - an irreverent, semi-pornographic journal about the fictitious Myra Breckinridge. It was released in 1968 but is an incredible book to read today, in a world where Bruce Jenner has transformed publicly to Caitlyn, because it forces you to examine gender identities, how gender itself is a social construct and is interchangeable. It was super controversial when it came out - but became a bestseller and was then turned into a movie that was panned by everyone including the author. Gore Vidal said it was a piece of s**t, basically, so the film is not at all what I recommend.But the book is absolutely worth it. I read it about 15 years ago and I'm looking forward to re-reading it again in today's world after so much has changed and so much has stayed the same. Given that we live in a post-Kardashian reality, it's important to understand the impact of someone's identity, frivolity, popularity and the psychology of society today. And Gore Vidal did it back in the '60s. \nAmerican Gods by Neil Gaiman First you need to understand that Neil Gaiman is the most talented fantasy writer on the planet today! He mines myths beautifully. He's the guy who knows the gods and goddesses, whispers, urban legends and folklore of every major culture that has probably ever existed, and presents them in highly fictionalised, very contemporary stories. American Gods is about a battle between the old gods and the new, but set in contemporary America. So Norse gods like Loki and Odin versus new gods created by television and the Internet, which appear larger than life today. His premise is that a god is simply that which enough people believe in - a god is only as powerful as the number of his followers. So the new \"gods\" are now usurping the old. I read it three years ago and it blew my mind, pretty much. I've read it twice overall. It's a cracker of an epic story! \nThe Girl On The Train by Paula Hawkins and The Truth About The Harry Quebert Affair by Joël Dicker I've just finished reading them both. My most favourite genre at the moment is the whodunit and these two books were absolute page-turners. I didn't know what was going to happen till the end! The thrill of not knowing and the pressure of keeping your ego intact by guessing the murderer well in time, is exactly what I love about mystery novels. I devour books by the dozen and only take a couple of days to finish one. So by the time your article goes to print, my answer will be long obsolete! \nNarcissus And Goldmund by Hermann Hesse Spending more than 250 days in a year on the road can allow for a lot of time to read. A lot of my work is in remote areas where there is poor or expensive mobile network service or there is not enough power to recharge one's gadgets. I work on my own; there is no conversation partner. So, after any photo or film project, a book helps me wind down. I don't like to read on a flight. Planes are for the flicks I missed watching. One of my all-time favourites is Narcissus and Goldmund by Hermann Hesse. The book was given to me in my somewhat lost years by my ex-partner. It talks about the struggle of creativity versus the temptations of life (including the material comforts that always conflict with the larger journey). It was an epiphany about my own process-orientation or a goal-driven end. As an artist, reading this book put me into a space where I questioned a lot of what I did as I went forward. BONUS : I also recommend It's a Long Story: My Life , by Willie Nelson. It is time we read about this American icon, an old-school liberal in music. I was never a big fan of country music but Willie's political stand is not about Left or Right, it is issue-based. This is inspiring, considering that today music is more about packaging and less about writing. Sample the romance in the lyrics of Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain: In the twilight glow I see them/ Blue eyes cryin' in the rain/ When we kissed goodbye and parted/ I knew we'd never meet again…These days, I am reading Jenny Nordberg's The Underground Girls of Kabul . It has given me the opportunity to reflect on issues relating to the girl child today. Apart from being interestingly written, it also reflects on gender issues in conflict areas and further marginalisation of the female of the species. \nThe Prophet by Kahlil Gibran I came across Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet at an airport five years ago and I was surprised by how much it resonated with me. The story touched on everything, from love, marriage, children, giving and eating to law, freedom, money and death. Shortly after I read the book, someone close to me died and the book gave me great comfort to think of them in the afterlife. Today, we pretend death or major illnesses will never happen to us and we're surprised when it does. We try to avoid it with anti-ageing products, surgery and the pursuit of everlasting life. We need to re-learn to accept all that life has to offer - the joy and the suffering. A message from the book is still with me: 'You are far, far greater than you know - and all is well'! \nHoly Cow by Sarah Macdonald Reading helps me relax and keeps me updated on several levels. Today, if I have to excel in my field, I need to keep abreast of a lot of things. So I pick up cookbooks from various regions and countries and books that talk about culture of a specific region. I do scan bestseller lists but the books I end up buying are usually the ones recommended by my family and friends. I loved Holy Cow . I bought this book at Amsterdam airport some years ago and enjoyed it thoroughly. I could easily relate to it because like the author, almost every foreigner who comes to India does so with a preconceived notion about the country, the people and the food. They feel that there is no concept of fine dining here and Indian food is only about spices and chicken tikka masala. It's only when they spend some time here or experience the real India that they realise how wrong they were. BONUS : The Flavour Thesaurus by Niki Segnit works well for anyone interested in food. It covers the art of combining flavours - how to pair your food and wine or even think of using unconventional flavours together. It works wonders for me, as I'm always experimenting with food, but it will interest just about anyone curious about the subject of how we eat. \nThe Wealth Of Nations by Adam Smith It's true. I am recommending a book about economics. The Wealth of Nations is so insightful. Economics is the queen of the sciences for a reason - it is the study of incentives, and incentives are fuelled by humans. So economic behaviour is basically human behaviour - it involves psychology, history, politics, geography and other social sciences. As a middle-class child, money is a pretty foreign conceptto me. I just don't get how people create wealth or talk about one crore-two crores.And you can read it for pleasure! I first read it at 19, when I was studying economics, then I read it all over again forthe joy of it. Adam Smith was writing in 1776 but he makes you a part of it. I didn't feel alienated. I remember going over his Broken Window theory like a hundred times because it was so fascinating.Two boys on the street hurl a stone at the baker's window, setting off an economic chain reaction: The baker has to contact the glazier, who has to contact the pane maker, who has to find the man who makes the glue for the pane, thereby creating an economy in a way you didn't expect. It was one of the most entertaining things I read in college. BONUS : More people should read The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood. As middle-class Indians we inhabit a world of certain privilege. We don't scrounge for food and shelter every day. But when you place mankind in a dystopian or post-apocalyptic situation, you end up boiling things down to the basics. You are reduced to your most primitive function: survive and procreate and that's what happens to the women in the book. My hair stands on end recalling some scenes. Another super book is Robert A Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land about a person (his parents perished on a space station), who is rescued by a new mission years later. This guy is human in form but knows nothing of life and society, and questions, naïvely, everything you do. He's alien to his own culture and it makes you re-examine your own reality.Can I add one more? - this is so awkward! - The Fran Lebowitz Reader . She's one of my favourite comediennes of all time. Oh and everyone should read Desmond Morris's books - The Naked Ape, The Human Zoo and so on. It's pop evolutionary biology. I add pop because it was very easy to read, I couldn't stop turning the pages. And it's full of great mysteries: Why do we have eyebrows? How and why does your body store fat? Great stuff! I want to say that I've avoided the Game of Thrones books because only the cool kids are doing it! \nThe Kenneth Anderson Omnibus At the moment, I'm embarrassed to say that my reading habits have atrophied. I usually read just before bedtime. And it has to be a hardcopy book and not something on a Kindle. I stare at screens all day, whether it's a laptop or a phone. So I don't want to do that while reading. I am a fan of flicking the pages and taking in the smell of a book.I am not a big fan of depressing tales where everybody is suffering. I recommend the Kenneth Anderson Omnibus . Anderson was a British hunter who was born and lived in India, and wrote about his adventures in the jungles of South India in the '50s and '60s. On one hand, the book depicts the end of the Raj in India, on the other, its narrative and the clarity with which he describes the jungle is very poetic and engaging. You sort of get a glimpse of the forest through his words and descriptions. And especially for a wildlife enthusiast like me, who goes on a lot of safaris and photographs tigers. It is incredibly charming.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T17:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T13:34:35.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
