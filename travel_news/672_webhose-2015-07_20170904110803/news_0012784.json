Nielsen, who's been with the department for about 10 years, flew both the Confederate and American flags from the back of the truck. He said neither his town nor his department had anything to do with it. \nNielsen said he's not for slavery, but did it because he was fed up with political correctness. \n\"It was my decision and I didn't think it was going to be a big deal, but boy was I wrong,\" Nielsen told The Associated Press. \nHe said Hartland Fire Chief Trent Wangen suspended him Sunday pending an investigation. \n\"More than likely I'll probably be asked to step down,\" Nielsen said. \"I respect that and will do that if they want.\" \nThe killings of nine people at a historically black South Carolina church last month have sparked debate nationwide about the appropriateness of displaying the Confederate flag. The man charged in the shooting deaths had posted photographs of himself with the flag on social media. \nNielsen said he didn't think flying the flag would draw as much flak as it has. It's been the subject of critical tweets and Facebook postings. He said a woman wearing a Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party patch came up to him and criticized the flag before the parade, but other spectators stood up and clapped as the truck flying both the U.S. and Confederate flags passed by. \nFriday's parade was organized by the Albert Lea Chamber of Commerce. Its executive director, Randy Kehr, said the display was \"unfortunate\" but within the firefighter's rights. He told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis he didn't know ahead of time that the truck would carry the Confederate flag, and probably would have respectfully asked Nielsen not to fly it if he had known. \nNielsen said he was told the Chamber of Commerce is having a special meeting on the subject Tuesday. He said he's willing to go and make a public apology. \n\"I'm sorry for what I caused my town, the Hartland Fire Department and even my family,\" Nielsen said. \nNielsen, who is white, said he's not a racist. \n\"I don't see race,\" he said. \"Black and white are the same to me. My belief is that 'politically correct' is going too far.\" \nThis story has been corrected to show that the parade was in Albert Lea, not Hartland. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T00:22:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
