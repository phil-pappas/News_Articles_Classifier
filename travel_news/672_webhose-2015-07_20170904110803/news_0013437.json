Even now, I’m not entirely sure why they did it. Was it to avoid some tiresome neighbours? Or perhaps to save a few pounds of council tax? Is Wiltshire not posh enough? There have been a few stories about houses being re-located like this, and, now we know it can be done, it opens up exciting possibilities. • Famous buildings that have moved It could help with divorces; instead of selling the marital home and sharing the proceeds, divorcing couples could split the house into two semis and move one half a safe distance away. In some cases, couples might decide to stay together for the sake of the chimneys. Sarah and Adam Howard's house in Wiltshire before they had it dismantled (SWNS Group) A husband, noting that his wife has removed exactly half the tiles from the roof might get an inkling there was something wrong with his marriage.

The New Forest (Alamy) For what it must be costing, I think the owners could have posted every single brick of the house by Royal Mail (first class) to some other spot in the country. I’d suggest it to them if I could think of a tactful way of putting it. I suppose I could tell them I’ve heard very good things about Uley.
