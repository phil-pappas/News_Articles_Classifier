One reason is that the last three to four Eids have come during the summer holidays,” said Nadeem Khanzadah, head of omnichannel retail at Jumbo Group.\nOnmichannel retailers (having physical and virtual stores) are offering special discounts on virtual stores on certain products to boost sales. \nHe said that smartphones are still growing at a healthy pace but tablets and cameras are declining. \nSome retailers are offering close to Dh1,000 as cash back or on bundled offers on smartphones and Dh4,000 as bundled offers on TVs. \nBhatnagar said that TVs are expected to do well after mobiles as people look for bigger screen sizes to entertain visitors. \nWith DSS (Dubai Summer Surprises) set to kick in, retailers expects sales to pick up further as tourist are pouring in as some Gulf countries have declared one-week holidays for Eid Al Fitr. \nBhatnagar said that tourists can only spend time at the malls due to the hot weather outside. So sales at major malls are expected to pick up. \n“Tourists buy smartphones rather than TVs while point-and-shoot camera sales are already down due to the cannibalisation of smartphones,” Khanzadah said. \nMany retailers are offering zero per cent financing options in tie-up with major banks and this is making a big difference in sales for some retailers. \nZero per cent financing option has made a difference but not so much for Jumbo. The mindset of the people is to “pay by cash or use credit card,” according to Khanzadah. “It is not a buying culture on instalment here. The offers are quite good during this week,” he said. \nBut it has made a big difference for Emax. “It helps buyers to upgrade and go for better products,” Bhatnagar said. \nBy Naushad K ?Cherrayil Staff Reporter \nGulf News 2015.
