The planes could be taking off by the minute from small inner city airports with ski-jump runways, served by metro rail stations for direct ease of access. The shuttle planes could link with major hub airports for long- haul flights. Ticketing with the supporting local rail lines could be integrated with an easy transfer – off the metro and across to the plane.\nJohn Burns \nWorld powers, giant business and banking cartels already know that fossil fuels will become depleted at the rates they are being consumed at. The only way forward is for the banking, oil and power industries to start ploughing real investment into these new sciences and away from fossil fuels. Renewables are only a small part of the answer.\n\"Towag\" \nPlastic planes maybe, but not battery powered. Many of the world's brainiest people and millions of dollars have been applied over many years to the aim of getting a battery light enough for flight, but we are still a long way off. It is more likely we will find a new propulsion system for planes before that happens.\nDerek Colman \nPassenger windows should be done away with, thus making the fuselage more streamlined. Wingtip cameras and overhead screens would allow passengers to see the outside world, or even a selection of films.\n\"Revolting pensioner\" \nSpanish fiestas \nYou have left off the best one in Galicia. Forget the ham and go to the festival of San Juan in the city of A Coruña on Playa de Riazor.\n\"Joe Public\" \nTunisia off the map \nTunisia relies heavily on its tourist industry. The Foreign Office is effectively putting a lot of people out of business. As their ambassador says, desperation only opens up more radicalisation possibilities. This action may well lead to short-term gains, but long- term losses.\nRichard Flynn \nSo, the FCO is calling for Brits to leave a country where the risk of a terror attack is \"highly likely\" and to return to a country where the risk of a terror attack is \"imminent\". Interesting logic!\n\"ChrisR8\" \nWell done the scaredy Foreign Office. You've handed a fabulous country to the terrorists by letting one lone gunman win. The Foreign Office is clearly unable to conduct a reasoned risk assessment. Germany and France are not so scared.\nWendy Graham \nAfter the Tunisia attack, I couldn't believe your comments suggesting Isis will now try to find another area of the Mediterranean to attack. Your comments will cause complete panic in an already unstable industry.\nName withheld \nGreece is the word \nI kept \"Meet me in the Tsipras Taverna\" because the advice it gives seems so wrong. Holidays consist of so much more than food and memories. People often get ill, and need to go to a pharmacy. What happens if there is no medicine? The hospital service may have broken down.\nJohn Easey \nRyanair offers 1m bargain tickets \nFifteen years ago we bought plenty of flights for £1, £2, £4 each way to Pisa or Paris. We were lucky: no APD and silly prices. We love Ryanair and easyJet for the travel opportunities they have given us.\n\"Chris Engineer\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T15:49:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
