It is one of five Saudi new builds being rolled out by the hospitality firm over the next four years, with two planned for Riyadh, one for Al Khobar and the 233-key Mvenpick Hotel City Star Jeddah.\n\nSet to occupy a prime location on Prince Sultan Road, Mvenpick Hotel Heraa Jeddah will be ideally placed to capitalise on the city's growing popularity as a business and leisure destination, with several major infrastructure developments underway designed to cater to the on-going swell in tourism numbers.\n\n\"The hotel is just five minutes from Jeddah's King Abdulaziz International Airport, which is currently undergoing a US7.2 billion expansion to take its ultimate capacity to 80 million passengers annually. We will therefore be the first point of call for travellers stopping in Jeddah en-route to the two Holy Cities, Makkah and Madinah,\" says Andreas Mattmller, Chief Operating Officer, Mvenpick Hotels & Resorts, Middle East and Asia.\n\nHe was speaking after a management deal for Mvenpick Hotel Heraa Jeddah was recently inked with Dr. Mohamed Ali Al-Turki, Chairman/CEO of Mohamed Al-Turki Group of Companies. The signing ceremony was attended by Jean Gabriel Prs, President and CEO of Mvenpick Hotels & Resorts.\n\n\"Mvenpick has a strong track record in managing properties in Jeddah and across Saudi Arabia, which made the hospitality firm a natural partner for this exciting new venture,\" said Dr. Mohamed Ali Al-Turki. \n\nThe hotel will be in close proximity to high-profile mega developments such as the Kingdom Tower and Jeddah Waterfront. Several \"stand out\" food and beverage outlets including two signature restaurants, plus a ballroom, seven meeting rooms, health club with gym, and seven stand-alone villas will set Mvenpick's new Jeddah property apart from the competition. \n\nAbout MÃ¶venpick Hotels & Resorts \nMvenpick Hotels & Resorts, an international upscale hotel management company with over 16,000 staff members, is represented in 24 countries with 82 hotels, resorts and Nile cruisers currently in operation.
