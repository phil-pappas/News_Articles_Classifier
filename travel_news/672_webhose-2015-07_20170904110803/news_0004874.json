You imagine back to when it wasn't in that state and just kind of think about how time takes over things,\" Pagani said. \n\"That appeals to a lot of people... You imagine back to the day when this ship was on the water just doing what it did,\" he said. \nA decaying tug boat. Photo: Reuters \nIn the case of the PC-1264 submarine chaser, its role was to hunt German U-boats in an effort to protect allied merchant convoys crossing the Atlantic Ocean. It was one of two US Navy ships in World War II to be manned by a largely African-American group of enlisted sailors, according to NavSource.org, a naval history website. \nNearby sits the rust striped shell of YOG-64, its middle eaten away by corrosion that chewed a lacey pattern into its metal sides, long removed from its heyday as a World War II gasoline barge muscling its way across the Pacific Ocean for the US Navy. After the war, YOG-64 participated in nuclear weapons tests at the Bikini Atoll in the South Pacific in 1948. \nRavaged by storms and the passage of time, some boats that Pagani saw on earlier trips are now rotted beyond recognition. \nFor instance, searching for the Abram S. Hewitt, a coal-fired fireboat used by the Fire Department of New York from 1903 until 1958, Pagani struggled to find an identifiable porthole or smokestack among the wrecks sinking below the surface. \nDecayed and partly submerged ferries, tugs and military vessels.
