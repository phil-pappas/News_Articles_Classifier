At the Irish pavilion, there was Irish music and entertainment, as well as culinary treats from the Irish chefs and Irish brewers – giving Canadian attendees a real taste of Ireland. There was also a fun photo-booth, where festival-goers could place themselves in iconic spots around the island of Ireland and ‘jump into Ireland’ – to be in with a chance to win a holiday here.\nWith more than 35,000 people attending the three-day festival, it was an ideal platform to showcase the island of Ireland and our fantastic food and craft beer scene. Dana Welch, Tourism Ireland’s manager Canada, said: “We were delighted to join forces with Toronto’s Festival of Beer to present this showcase of Ireland’s craft beer, food and music. The island of Ireland’s food and craft beer scene is blossoming right now, with lots of new microbreweries, gastro-pubs, craft distilleries and local eateries serving the freshest ingredients – all sure to appeal to prospective Canadian visitors.\n“2014 was the best year ever for Irish tourism from Canada – with visitor numbers increasing by +30% over 2013. And the outlook for 2015 is positive, particularly given that the number of airline seats from Canada is set to increase by +22% in the peak summer months. With new, year-round direct air access from Toronto to Dublin, our message for Canadian holidaymakers is that the island of Ireland has never been so convenient or more affordable to get to.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T22:12:23.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
