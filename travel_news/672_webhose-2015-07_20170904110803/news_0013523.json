The Living Wage commitment will see everyone working at RefTech, regardless of whether they are permanent employees or third-party contractors and suppliers; receive a minimum hourly wage of £7.85 - significantly higher than the national minimum wage of £6.50. \nMargaret Reeves, RefTech managing director said: “I believe we are the first event industry supplier to gain this award and we urge our fellow suppliers to follow suit. We pride ourselves in offering a great service to our clients – but we may not be the cheapest because we pay our staff properly. I believe that many event suppliers simply cannot pay the living wage to staff because they do not charge a fair price for their services. This culture of knocking down prices and buying as cheaply as possible is damaging the industry and the wider UK economy and has to stop. I urge agencies and corporates not to simply buy on price alone, but to look at the ethics and ethos of their suppliers. If a quote is extremely cheap or a client knocks it down to an unworkable amount then it is the staff who will suffer. This then impacts on the UK economy too in the form of increased reliance on state provided ‘top ups’. Paying the living wage as a minimum is a very important commitment to our staff and I urge more industry suppliers to commit.” Living Wage Foundation Director, Rhys Moore said: “We are delighted to welcome RefTech to the Living Wage movement as an accredited employer. The best employers are voluntarily signing up to pay the Living Wage now. The Living Wage is a robust calculation that reflects the real cost of living, rewarding a hard day’s work with a fair day’s pay.” Employers choose to pay the Living Wage on a voluntary basis. The Living Wage enjoys cross party support, with public backing from the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition.
