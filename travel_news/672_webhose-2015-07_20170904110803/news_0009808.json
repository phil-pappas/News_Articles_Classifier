Since announcing the launch of the show last year, to date over 500 companies have signed up and 15,000 registrations have been received. In response to this early success, Media 10 have confirmed a five-year deal with the Birmingham venue. \nUK Construction Week will bring together the newly acquired Timber Expo, the Build Show and the highly successful Grand Designs Live, all of which were previously held at the NEC. In addition, a further six dedicated events will accompany UK Construction Week to create the most comprehensive construction focused event in the UK. Richard Morey, Group Events Director of Media 10, said: “The impact of UK Construction Week is going to be enormous, not just for the sector or the events industry but for the economy, for policy makers, and for everyone working in the construction sector. Each of the component shows will have a wealth of content so when you combine this nine-fold we will end up with an event that no visitor or exhibitor in the construction sector – from architect to designer to builder and contractor - can afford to miss.” The NEC offers a flexible space for organisers to host any type of event with over 182,000 square metres of covered indoor space across 20 interconnecting halls and 34 conference suites. The venue’s flexibility is a key factor in enabling Media 10 to merge and grow a number of exisiting shows to create one large scale event. Louise Conway, NEC Account Manager, said: “We are delighted to be hosting the first ever UK Construction Week. We have a fantastic long standing relationship with Media 10 and are looking forward to continuing to work with them to make their newest show a success. Exhibitions that launch at the NEC have an average growth of 31% in year two and 13% in year three and we are confident that this level can continue into year five and beyond.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T14:00:40.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
