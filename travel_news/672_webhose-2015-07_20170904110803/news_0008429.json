Over the weekend the city's police themselves reported two sightings of a big cat. Armed police converged on a ravine on Sunday after one officer saw a \"cat-like\" creature in the area and on the same day another officer spotted what appeared to be the same animal. On both occasions the \"lion\" escaped containment lines. The \"lion\" was first spotted last Monday, since then, dozens of people have called police to report sightings. Milwaukeeans are captivated by the possibility that a lion is roaming their city. \"We found the Milwaukee lion,\" proudly proclaimed Ken Kenitz, as he sped along with Nicole Anderson, who was dressed as a lion, covered in bronze body paint while wearing fake white whiskers, fluffy ears and long black fingernails. Mr Kenitz, a body painter, and Ms Anderson, his canvas, had just finished a photo shoot at several city landmarks as a way to document the lion craze that has consumed Milwaukee the sightings last week. • Big cat Britain: the sightings Many residents also fear for the lion's well-being. On Tuesday, a pit bull was shot in the paw when a gunman thought he had the large cat in his sights. \"I would only shoot it as a last resort .... I hope they can tranquilise it,\" said Reggie Bonds as he did maintenance work around two stone lions outside of a Milwaukee funeral home. \"I am wondering how it got here, but it probably was someone's pet.\" Wisconsin is one of six states that do not prohibit the owning of a lion as a pet, but Milwaukee ordinance bans ownership of dangerous animals. Police gather to set up near the area to contain a reported lion in Milwaukee (AP) Some have taken to social media to compare Milwaukee's lion to the Cowardly Lion in the movie Wizard of Oz. The Milwaukee lion was \"spotted in our parking lot dancing and singing with a girl in red shoes!\" the Nonprofit Center of Milwaukee tweeted. • Helicopters deployed in search for Essex lion A handful of social media accounts posing as the lion have also been created. \"I love gazelles ... but there is sort of a manhunt going on right now,\" one Tweet said. Playing off the city's nickname from its brewing history, the tagline of a Facebook account was \"Just a cat that hangs out in Brew City.\" Businesses have also got into the act, such as the Roman Coin, a tavern on the city's East Side, that deems itself a \"lion safety zone\" on its sidewalk sign. A billboard company is also posting messages such as \"let's play hide-and-go-seek\" with portraits of lions on boards throughout the city. \"It's a fun way ... to look at what's going on,\" said Kurt Weis, a vice president of Lamar Advertising. A local print shop has even created and sold more than 90 \"I survived #MkeLion\" T-shirts. \"We are just having fun with the craze,\" said Brad Kuehl, the general manager at Eggers Imprints. The Milwaukee Zoo, where several lions reside, assured the community that no lions were missing from its facility before it posted a few Tweets making light of the sightings. \"On Wednesdays, Milwaukee County residents receive reduced admission. But remember, that's humans only,\" it Tweeted with a photo of a lion. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T08:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T06:08:07.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
