The most amusing analysis I’ve seen comes from people who say that the Greek referendum on whether or not to accept \"austerity\" is a \"triumph of democracy\".\nTwo points here. The word \"austerity\" is really a victory of euphemism over dictionaries. It has a few meanings that can apply to architecture or fashion or whatever. But as a state of being it is to be without comfort or luxury, and yet it is brandished by the perpetually furious as though such a way of life for the severely indebted is a great crime against humanity.\nSecondly, the referendum was absolutely a triumph of democracy. And, let me tell you, if it was put to a vote I might well burst into song: \"They tried to make me pay my credit card and I said, ‘oxi, oxi oxi’.\"\nThe reason people think this outcome is a \"triumph\" is that they think it is a triumph over capitalism. They think it’s a victory over Germans and their evil banks. But this just goes to show how very little the left understands about what has happened here.\nBecause, actually, I agree. Greek debt should have been left in the hands of the private banks that took the risk to lend them the money. It should never have been socialised without permission. But in order to save that great left-wing experiment and evident disaster, the euro, the debt was bought by various European federal and national central banks, and the International Monetary Fund.\nIn other words, countries such as Italy and Spain, that have endured \"austerity\" and have appalling youth unemployment, have lent Greece money so the Greeks could enjoy retiring on 90% of their final salary.\n...\nTHIS must be very nice if you’re Greek, but not so nice if you’ve sacrificed the prosperity of an entire generation in order to prop up the whole system. This means that the Spaniards and the Italians and, indeed, the Germans, also have a democratic mandate, just as legitimate as the Greek democratic mandate, to get their money back. Why does Greek democracy trump German democracy? You’ll have to ask the left that one.\nAnd in any case, converting privately held debt into sovereign debt and making the IMF and European Central Bank grab their share too, all in the name of their citizens’ children, is about as far from \"capitalism\" as I can imagine.\nAnd that the banks took up to a 40% \"haircut\" when the debt was transferred has already manifested itself as a huge debt relief for the Greeks — something nobody seems to want to remember.\nIn a capitalist world, the debt would have remained in private hands — namely, the banks — and Greece would have defaulted. This would have been bad for Greece and very, very bad for the banks. And that would have been that.\n...\nBUT people are terrified of this truth. The fact is that the whole unspeakably tragic mess has been made by governments trying to prop up private banks and a monetary union that was flawed from the beginning.\nBut because left-wingers love the idea of the European Union — a vast, quasi-elected collectivist super-state — they pretend that capitalism did this. A closer look at the crime will show that the only fingerprints at the scene are those of governments, not businesspeople.\nIt is impossible to feel anything but enormous sympathy for the Greeks. Their situation is ghastly. But this hasn’t been done to them by anybody but themselves, and it is equally within that where the answer lies.\nGrexit should not be avoided. Reprise the drachma, slash taxes and watch the magic of trade do its work is my hope, unlikely as it is.\nAs for South Africans, well there are lessons aplenty in all of this, which I’m quite sure we’ll miss as a result of our rampant exceptionalism.\nNotions of austerity in its real sense filled my mind as I drove a car the other day, and such are the negative associations with this word I am aware that this will be unavoidably misinterpreted as criticism. But it really isn’t.\nThe new Volkswagen Golf SV, or \"Sportsvan\" in other territories, is a Volkswagen Golf with a higher, more MPV-shaped roof line.\nOdd as it might seem, I’d like to start with what you don’t get with this car. You don’t get 4x4 or a raised ride height. It is not a \"crossover\". You do not get an enormously powerful engine and you do not get rear-wheel drive either. You do not get laugh-out-loud handling or acceleration.\nYou do not get satnav (although you can spec it). You don’t get seven seats and you don’t get a particularly luxurious interior. There is precious little chrome and no wood to be found. You do not get electric seats. There is no reverse camera and you pay a lot extra for an automatic gearbox.\nWhat you get is a car. You sit a little higher and you get certain added practicalities over a standard Golf, such as improved headroom for when you’re strapping in the kids, and sliding rear seats, which means you can vary your luggage space/rear legroom mix as suits your particular journey.\n...\nTHE car I drove was a TSi version with a 1.4l turbopetrol engine that averaged 6.3l/100km over my test period. We got all of our three kids in just fine, and because they are little and have short legs, there was boot space for our gargantuan and hateful double-pram.\nOtherwise, it is really just a practical Golf. Now, given that the Golf in its current form is officially All The Car You’ll Ever Need, this is just a car that perfects the almost-perfect car for families.\nTo drive it is as solid as a rock. The added weight and marginally worse centre of gravity aren’t really too discernible, and ride and handling are really very good indeed. It is quiet and refined.\nThe SV is only available with the 92kW version of VW’s 1.4l, which makes progress satisfactory if not scintillating. Getting from 0-100km/h takes a fraction fewer than 10 seconds. That might sound feeble but its 200Nm makes for good freeway ability with cruise control, the laden car happily coping with reasonable inclines in sixth gear. Steering is good and precise, if a little light, and the manual gear change is easy.\nThe standard R325,200 car I drove was enhanced with entirely sensible options such as a R7,000 towbar and R4,500 park distance control (c’mon VW, that really should be standard) and luxuriated in nice-to-have R11,500 leather seats, which you could probably manage without.\nI am aware that this is starting to read perilously like a car review, and for that I apologise, but here’s the thing about the Golf SV. I loved it.\nIt’s an example of staggeringly assured automotive packaging. It takes a scalpel to the hierarchy of needs, and boils off all the superfluous nonsense until you have practicality distilled. It has everything you need and nothing you don’t.\nSome call this austerity, I call it utterly brilliant design and engineering.
