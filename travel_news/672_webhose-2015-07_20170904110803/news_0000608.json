(AP) â€” Maximum fines for carnival ride accidents in North Carolina would rise exponentially in legislation that's now passed both chambers in one version or another.\nThe Senate voted unanimously Wednesday for a measure that increases the top civil penalties fivefold, reaching $5,000 per violation in some situations. The House approved different increases in March and must decide whether to accept the Senate's changes.\nThe original legislation was filed in response to a ride accident at the 2013 North Carolina State Fair that injured several people, three critically. Both versions also create a new felony for violations causing serious injury or death.\nThe Senate also wants the state Labor Department to study the need for regulating zip lines. A 10-year-old girl died last month in a zip line accident in Alleghany County.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T13:07:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
