The mixture of glorious beaches, lively resorts, whitewashed towns, historic architecture and tasty cuisine is irresistible – as are the superb golf and high number of sunny days. With Brittany Ferries services direct to Santander and Bilbao from England’s south coast, getting to warmer climes with your own vehicle is easy and enjoyable. Why not make it the drive part of the trip? Brittany Ferries can book accommodation in some of Spain’s most beautiful spots along the way, making for some fascinating stop-offs as you head south. You can even stay in the country’s Paradores – luxurious hotels which are often housed in historic monasteries, manor houses and palaces. The Costa Del Sol is always popular, yet many travellers do not realise that the region extends to the east of Málaga as well as to the west. An appealing place in which to stay for an extended break is Torrox, divided between a small coastal resort and a quaint hill town. Down at the shore, there’s a promenade with restaurants and bars behind a Blue Flag beach, while up in the town you can sip coffee in an atmospheric old square. About six miles away is Nerja, one of Spain’s most attractive seaside towns. Its Balcon de Europa juts out from a cliff to give far-reaching coastal views and its old quarter is full of interesting shops. Just beyond the town are spectacular show caves and a series of untouched beaches. Málaga does not always get the praise it deserves. The provincial capital has a 10th-century castle, Roman amphitheatre, Picasso museum and a new sister to France’s famous Pompidou Centre. It is about an hour’s drive from Torrox. Not much further is Granada, home of one of Europe’s greatest historical treasures, the Alhambra complex. Winter is the best time to visit, without the crowds. Inland from Torrox is the area known as the Axarquia, a wide valley filled with orchards and ringed by mountains, where there are many scenic hiking and cycling routes. The area also offers chances to engage with local culture. Look out for events such as the Festival of Migas in December, celebrating a local dish made from chorizo. In Torrox, Brittany Ferries offers the stylish Apartamentos Fuerte Calaceite for your four-week winter break. About two miles from the coastal resort, the one- and two-bedroomed apartments have terraces with good views, use of two outdoor pools (one open in winter), mini-market and bike hire. Priced from just £645pp for four weeks including your cruise-ferry crossing, it’s a great choice for a holiday that can be as active or relaxed as you like. 320 days of sunshine: Costa Blanca is an all year round holiday hot spot Another special spot is Calpe, on the Costa Blanca. Although some Brits fell in love with this seaside resort near Benidorm many years ago, it’s still something of a secret, despite the fact that it is dominated by the mighty 1,000ft Rock of Ifach that rises straight out of the sea. Here on the Costa Blanca, there are more than 320 days of sunshine per year, perfect for flopping on one of the town’s three fine beaches or exploring the unspoilt countryside. Calpe has a good sprinkling of restaurants and bars and while only the fittest will want to climb the giant rock, the old part of town is a rewarding place to wander, with ancient walls, a Moorish quarter and two museums. The local rice dishes must be tried. Hikers can head for the nearby Sierra de Bernia and its dramatic ridge and shoppers can visit Benidorm 20 minutes down the coast. Two golf courses are within a brief drive of Calpe. Alicante, with a notable basilica and huge palm grove, is an hour away and can be reached by narrow-gauge railway. Brittany Ferries suggests the Apartamentos Sol y Mar as your base for a Calpe sojourn. In the centre of town, the apartments are part of a hotel, so you get privacy and space with the facilities of a four-star hotel. The fully-equipped accommodation has access to a quality restaurant, supermarket, infinity pool, gym and a spa. A four-week holiday at the Apartamentos Sol y Mar costs from just £609pp including cruise-ferry crossing. Both the Sol and Blanca costas offer the chance for a satisfying journey down through Spain from the ports of Santander or Bilbao, perhaps stopping over at cities such as Madrid (for Torrox) and Zaragoza (for Calpe).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T00:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T19:49:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
