No Dig Trenchless Sewer has been providing sewer repair in Oakland for over 20 years. They are the market leader when it comes to helping people get the PSL Certificate to be compliant with the new Private Sewer Lateral Ordinance. The new website will make it easier for potential customers to learn more about their company. \"We are proud of the new website and the feedback we have received has been very positive,\" says Gary of No Dig Trenchless Sewer. \nOakland sewer repair contractors at No Dig Trenchless Sewer have the most advanced equipment available. This means that they can complete a trenchless pipe replacement faster, which saves homeowners money according to Gary. \"We continually upgrade our equipment because we want our crews to be as efficient as possible. Fewer equipment breakdowns and better machinery gives us a great advantage when it comes to delivering the highest level of service available. We can complete most sewer line replacements in 1 day.\" \nSewer repair in Oakland is highly regulated and a permit is required to do any complete pipe replacement. Gary says consumers should be careful when reviewing estimates. \"We see a lot estimates out there that come back with a price that is too low to believe. When we take a look at the estimate we quickly discover that permit fees and other costs have been left out of the estimate so the price looks lower. In actuality the permit fee will be added later making the price significantly higher. We do our estimates as an all-inclusive package so there are no surprises.\" Gary also warns against hiring unlicensed contractors. \nCalifornia law requires that all people performing sewer line repair or replacement be licensed. Gary says it is not uncommon to see unlicensed people trying to pose as licensed contractors to get business. \"We get calls all of the time from people who have a very low estimate and they want us to match it. When they send it over we can quickly determine that the bid is from an unlicensed contractor. This means they don't have worker's compensation insurance and it also means they can't pull a permit unless they use somebody else's license which is illegal.\" \nIn addition to being Oakland and Lafayette sewer repair and replacement contractors No Dig Trenchless Sewer also provides water line repair and replacement. \"We handle all types of underground plumbing including sewer, gas and water. We have been running into a lot of situations where people need new water pipes. We are happy to come out and give a no cost estimate for this type of work.\" No Dig Trenchless Sewer will also beat any written estimate from a licensed contractor by at least 5%. \"We want to deliver maximum value to our customers and part of that is making sure they are getting the best price available,\" says Gary. \nTo learn more about No Dig Trenchless Sewer in Oakland please visit their website.
