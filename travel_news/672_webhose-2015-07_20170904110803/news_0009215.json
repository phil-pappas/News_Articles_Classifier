It was the autumn of 1993 and I was walking through the park at Alexandra Palace with my friend and fellow long-suffering Spurs fan Tim Green. We were probably discussing the likelihood of Spurs winning the league that season when I was distracted by the sight of wild mushrooms growing in the lush grass. A little further into the park and I noticed the bramble bushes had beautiful, fat blackberries growing on them. We always used to pick them at home for my mother to make her apple and blackberry crumble or, if we were lucky, an Eve’s pudding spiked with the deep purple berries. I must have been thinking aloud when I said to Tim: “You know, you could probably make a great meal just from the ingredients growing here. Imagine a dinner party [this was the height of my ambition then] using just food from this park.” Cooking local: courgette flowers with rosemary I had read somewhere about a Chinese idea that you should only eat food from the area that surrounds you and, although I would dispute the health benefits, it was a very romantic notion. But this was all put on the back burner as I taught myself how to cook in the style that was prevalent at the time, namely modern European, as practised by the likes of Alistair Little and Rowley Leigh. • Stephen Harris: I fell for a tart and it changed my life Six years later in the summer of 1999, I was back in Whitstable and everything seemed to be falling into place. My brother Phil had come back from a spell in Saudi Arabia selling Harley-Davidsons and was keen to move forward with our idea of opening a restaurant together. At the same time my younger brother Damian was having great success with his Brighton-based dance label, Skint Records, and – thanks largely to the music of Fatboy Slim – it looked like we would have no trouble raising some money. I had found the perfect site, a run-down pub by the sea on the edge of Whitstable, and my mind was turning to the type of food I would cook as I worked out my notice at the beachside Whitstable Oyster Company. Stephen Harris sourcing ingredients near his pub in Whistable (ANDREW CROWLEY) One summer evening as the sun set over the bay, filling the room with a very flattering orange light, I looked at the dish I was sending out and my mind went back to that walk in the park. In front of me was a whole roast sea bass stuffed with rosemary picked from a bush on the beach, served with Thanet new potatoes and beans that had been picked that morning from a local farm. The bass had arrived at the back door just minutes before it was cooked. This was, to my mind, close to perfection. Simple, maybe – but simplicity isn’t easy. It requires getting hold of just-picked vegetables and fish caught hours before, but mainly it requires the guts to serve such unadorned food. The work here was in the sourcing rather than the technique of the chef. I had found the style I would serve: great, super-fresh local ingredients, cooked with skill but never allowing the wild flavours to be ruined by a chef’s ego. Little did I know then how far this idea could be taken or the story behind the land that surrounded my run-down pub.
