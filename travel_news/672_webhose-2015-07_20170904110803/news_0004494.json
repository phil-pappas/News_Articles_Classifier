We are not really a big market, although our repeated travel (figures) are very high for a small country like Singapore.” \nThe cruise industry’s growth in the last six months has been flat, said Ms Siaw, but she thinks prospects are good in the long term. \n“South-east Asia has the cultural diversity to attract the Chinese to cruise in this region,” she said. \nAside from typical cruise liners, the SCC has ventured into courting boutique ships, which cater to wealthier travellers, said Ms Siaw. “A night on boutique ships will probably cost twice or thrice as much as a night on a (cruise) ship. We court these passengers as it (will be) good for Singapore’s tourism industry.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T07:41:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
