Additionally, Argentina remains the main source, with 1.74 million visitors, followed by the United States (656,000). \nThe 2014 FIFA World Cup played a major role in this important result to the Brazilian tourism industry. In June, when the biggest soccer event in the world was held, Brazil received almost three times the usual number of tourists on that month; from 350 thousand, in 2013, to more than 1 million in 2014. \nVinícius Lummertz, president of the Brazilian Tourism Board (EMBRATUR) also celebrates this important result. “Hosting major sporting events like the FIFA World Cup last year and the Summer Olympics in 2016, represents an extraordinary improvement in the Brazilian tourism industry, without mentioning how we showcase Brazil to the world, which is immeasurable. These numbers are a record to our country and we know that the World Cup was the most responsible for this achievement,” said Vinícius Lummertz, president of Embratur (Brazilian Tourism Institute). \nThe tourism authorities in the country now aim for the Summer Olympics, in Rio de Janeiro, next year. One of the main initiatives of the government is to suspend the mandatory visa between Brazil and the United States, in order to increase the number of visitors in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T02:39:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
