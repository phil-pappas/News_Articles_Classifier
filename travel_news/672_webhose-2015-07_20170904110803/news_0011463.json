The group will mark the end of their custodianship of the landmark on Friday, July 10, 2015, less than a week after it was named a UNESCO world heritage site. (AP Photo/Eric Gay, File) \nThe prayers were recited in English, Spanish, Danish and German during the event in front of the Alamo. A group of men in period dress stood as honour guard. One of the men led cheers for the group, while another played \"The Yellow Rose of Texas\" on the bagpipe.\nTourists came and went apparently unaware of the ceremony. The Daughters ended the event by lowering their U.S. and Texas flags. Another Texas flag was run up the Alamo's flagpole.\nThe group will operate a research centre and conduct programs on the site. However, under a state mandate, the Daughters began turning authority over the Alamo to the Texas General Land Office in March. Last month, Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation that removes a representative of the group from the Alamo advisory board.\nThe Alamo was the site of an 1836 battle in the Texas war of independence from Mexico. The battle led to the deaths by Mexican troops of some 180 defenders of the besieged fort. Weeks later, those deaths provided Texas irregulars with their rallying cry that they carried to victory at the Battle of San Jacinto, which clinched Texas' independence from Mexico.\nA lawsuit for control of the archives the Daughters have accumulated at the Alamo since 1950 is pending. The group's president general, Dr. Betty Joe Edwards, has said the group will monitor how the state operates the site.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T23:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T05:20:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
