Its medieval streets are pleasant to wander and you'll be rewarded with fabulous views of the countryside along the medieval town walls. Cortona has remnants of its pre-Roman Etruscan past, Renaissance artists Luca Signorelli and Fra Angelico, and Baroque artist Pietro di Cortona. \nCortona Location: \nCortona is in the eastern part of Tuscany (see Tuscany map ), very near the border of the Umbria region and Lake Trasimeno . The closest cities are Arezzo in Tuscany and Perugia in Umbria. \nTransportation to Cortona: \nCortona is reachable by train from Rome, Florence, or Arezzo. There are two stations, both below the town, at Terontola-Cortona or Camucia-Cortona . From either station, a bus runs up the hill, arriving at Piazza Garibaldi just outside the center. Cortona can also be reached by bus from nearby towns and villages in Tuscany. If you're driving, take the A1 Valdichiana exit, then the Siena-Perugia motorway and exit at Cortona-San Lorenzo . Follow signs for Cortona. \nCortona Orientation: \nThe road to Cortona from the valley starts near the Melone Etruscan tombs.
