We expect these positive market sentiments to continue for the rest of the year,” Magazine said.\nOffice space demand in the NCR, Mumbai and Chennai also remained upbeat. Almost 53 per cent of total office space transactions in Q2 2015 was contributed by these three cities, each witnessing a healthy take-up of more than a 1 million sq ft of corporate real estate.\nThe quarter noted strong rental growth (5â€“6%) in Bangaloreâ€™s Central Business District (CBD), while rentals remained stable in the prime office districts of most cities.\nThe Kolkata CBD, on the other hand, saw a decline in rental values on the back of weak occupier demand.\nFor Updates Check Company News ; follow us on Facebook and Twitter\n 3:49 pm", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress", "http://twitter.com/financialxpress"], "published": "2015-07-10T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T15:19:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
