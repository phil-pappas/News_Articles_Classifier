Ready to embrace the child-friendly side of the city, we struggled at first but then stumbled across Les Berges, a mile-long creative playground and cultural space on the Left Bank of the Seine, affectionately dubbed Berge Street.\nKids were having a wild time, skateboarding, leaping onto climbing frames, playing hopscotch, tagging the giant slate drawing wall.

They sped off to hide in the tipis then challenged me to a game of swingball.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Renovated ship crates, known as Zzz pods Related: Top 10 museum cafes and restaurants in Paris\nWe discovered a row of glass “Zzz” pods – renovated ship crates in their own gardens that are free to hire for 1&frac12; hours to snooze or relax in – and also a five-lane running track. We grabbed pizza at Rosa Bonheur (great value and delicious), then sipped hot chocolate by a makeshift cafe strewn with board games and danced under the disco ball at Place de la Concorde, where music played through massive speakers. Later we chilled at FLOW , a cool alfresco bar that didn’t mind the little people!\nAs a family we have lost hours here; discovering something new on every visit – DJs at night was the latest. It’s free, loads of fun, forever changing and beautiful. Open all year round but in full swing over summer, it’s a fabulous place to unleash the child within and exhaust the kids.\n• From Port de Solférino to Port du Gros-Caillou, lesberges.paris.fr\nClaudette Parry is founder of the blog mamalovesparis.com", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Welcome+to+Berge+Street%2C+Paris%E2%80%99s+brilliant+child-friendly+space+on+the+Seine&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4af7a%2Fstw%23img-2", "http://lesberges.paris.fr/en/", "http://mamalovesparis.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4af7a%2Fsfb%23img-2&ref=responsive", "http://www.rosabonheur.fr/", "http://www.flow-paris.com/", "http://lesberges.paris.fr/en/envies/zzz/", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Welcome+to+Berge+Street%2C+Paris%E2%80%99s+brilliant+child-friendly+space+on+the+Seine&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Fjul%2F08%2Fparis-le-berge-street-seine-family-playground&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F7%2F8%2F1436366195738%2Fd81f45cc-55ef-4111-b633-8c17951a8beb-2060x1236.jpeg"], "published": "2015-07-08T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T23:02:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
