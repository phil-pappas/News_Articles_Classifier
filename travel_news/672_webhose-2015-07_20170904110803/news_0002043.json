Placing tourism at the heart of Government will do much to support plans to rebalance the economy. We will work closely with the new inter-ministerial group and our partners across the country to deliver on these commitments and drive growth across the regions by showcasing and developing the standout product on offer in this country to key domestic and international markets, improving connectivity, ensuring England remains globally competitive and providing world-class experiences for all visitors.”\n“We have invested £57m of Government funds in English tourism over the past five years which has to date generated over £1.5 billion growth in visitor spending and created over 28,000 jobs. We aim to build on this success with both the Northern and South West Tourism Growth Funds, and the proposed Product Development Fund recommended in the Triennial Review of VisitEngland.”\nAs part of a £5m South West Tourism Growth Fund announced by Government, a range of activity will take place to grow tourism; deliver economic growth and boost export earnings in the South West of England.\nJames Berresford continues: “Our ambition for the South West Tourism Growth Fund is to work closely with VisitBritain and partner destinations to create an additional visitor spend of £60m, supporting the creation of 1,000 jobs to boost the South West visitor economy.”\nIn addition, VisitEngland is also delivering a £10m Northern Tourism Growth Fund, working closely with VisitBritain and partner destinations from across the region to put the assets of the North firmly on the international map. The programme aims to deliver an additional 2m visitor nights to the North of England equating to £177m in international visitor expenditure and create 3,280 jobs.\nRelated Posts PROMPERÚ to tap Indian travel market World-Renowned Voices Jet In For Conflict Conference New Urban Adventure in Singapore makes stopover sightseeing easy The Future Looks Bright for English Tourism Winners of “Seychelles que j’aime” photo contest rewarded", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T20:17:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
