An invoice of almost five thousand pounds to cover the costs of his unacceptable behaviour has now been issued. He has also been given a lifetime ban and Jet2.com is intending to prosecute him for the disruption caused.\nMr Marshall was one of a party of 14 who, on a flight from Leeds Bradford Airport to Alicante on 29th May 2015, was asked numerous times to stop consuming illicit alcohol, using foul language and threatening behaviour. Due to his unruly actions, which are becoming a serious issue for the travel sector as a whole, the aircraft captain diverted the flight to Toulouse to protect the safety of the passengers and crew. He was off-loaded and handed over to the police authorities.\nPhil Ward, Managing Director of Jet2.com said: “To protect the safety and comfort of our loyal customers and staff, we openly pledged to take actions to stamp out antisocial behaviour onboard and that is exactly what we are doing. Jet2.com is a holiday airline, so we want holidaymakers to have a wonderful time from the moment they start their holiday with us.\n“More than 1,150 passengers were inconvenienced that day by Mr Marshall’s antisocial and unacceptable behaviour. This is why we issued him with this bill for the costs involved. Most passengers have a fantastic time travelling and of course know how to behave onboard, which is why we need to stop disorderly behaviour from the few like Mr Marshall.”\nSource:-Jet2.com\nRelated Posts Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building Austrian Airlines Financial Results as at 30 September 2013: Positive result gives optimism for break-even in 2013 BOC Aviation Marks 20th Year With Record Net Profit in 2013 Lufthansa Group increases result in core business April 1 Alert: WestJet moves to metric time", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T16:06:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
