I am not the world’s most avid sports fanatic, but I am married to a woman who is. Athletics on the box gives rise to shrieks that most people reserve for undergoing an attack by a madman with an axe. Test Match cricket is required viewing (Getty) Wimbledon is a holy fortnight and since Mrs T, in her youth, had a trial for Surrey Ladies Cricket Team, the Test Match is required viewing. Tickets for Wimbledon, Lords and the Oval are to her more precious than rubies and, to be honest, a seat at Wimbledon is for me every bit as exciting as it is for my wife. That said, my admiration is just as great for good commentators as it is for good sportsmen and women. Commentating is a contentious issue. Some among their number simply witter on. If they do so when nothing else is happening you can forgive them, but if they talk during a critical shot or rally they deserve to be drummed out of the commentary box. And as for moaning, there is one rugby commentator I could gladly garrotte. Novak Djokovic playing at Wimbledon this year (AFP) That said, it is no fun when a commentator is totally lacking personality. Those who have it in abundance risk being Marmite characters we love or loathe, but once they have worked their way into our hearts by virtue of familiarity and a neat turn of phrase, they add immeasurably to the pleasure of watching sport. Golf would not be the same without the avuncular and sometimes curmudgeonly Peter Alliss who can recall stories from the 1930s when his father played, as well as those from his own heyday in the 1940s and 50s. He can talk about seagulls and fusarium just as readily as he can about a mashie niblick (do they still have them?). I will listen to him happily whatever the nature of his chat. The grand tones of John Arlott still haunt the cricket world (Getty) The crusted-port tones of John Arlott still haunt Lords, the Oval and Headingly. Brian Johnston’s laughter at “the bowler’s Holding, the batsman’s Willey” is as fresh in my mind as the day it was minted. And we still have Blowers and Aggers to keep us company. Dan Maskell’s “Oh, I say!” at Wimbledon said as much about a passing shot as any analyst - so expressive was he and so conversationally economical. Alan Titchmarsh has just about got used to John McEnroe's commentary (AFP) Tennis players almost all speak in a monotone. Why? Is it years of practising breath control? I’m getting used to John McEnroe , but would far rather listen to Andrew Castle , who is informed, experienced and has a delivery of more than just one octave. But for them all I have some sympathy - they are a vital conduit between us and the sport. When they are good they are very, very good and when they are bad they at least give us something to complain about. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T10:33:41.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
