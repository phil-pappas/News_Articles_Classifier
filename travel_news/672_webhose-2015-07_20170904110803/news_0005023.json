Everywhere I look, I see fathers who have forgone the Hawaiian shirts (good riddance!), ditched wearing socks with those leather sandals, and shaken off the tyranny of the comb-over (just ick!). And perhaps even more unbelievable, these same dads who once embarrassed us with their numbskull social blunders have become, well, cool and generally safe to bring around friends. Yup, it’s a brave new world we live in. Gone are the days of the frumpy father! Long live the Modern Dad! \nAnd what, pray tell, distinguishes this newly evolved creature from his decidedly uncool ancestors? He’s hip, I tell you. He dresses better than the women that surround him. He visits the salon once a month to have his hair perfectly coifed. He’s suddenly become a tech guru a la Steve Jobs. And when he opens his mouth, behold , out of that dark cavern floweth wisdom on global matters of great import (instead of baseball stats). Seriously, who the heck is this guy? \nOf course, out with the old dad and in with the new (as great as this is), means we have to rewrite the rulebook when it comes to shopping for him. No longer will a random power tool from Home Depot suffice. No longer will an oversized polo shirt from J.C. Penny’s do the job \n(and shame on you for ever thinking that it would). Your modern dad now has modern standards. Good thing for you there’s a site perfectly designed for the new man dads everywhere have become, one devoted to modern apparel, accessories, home decor, gadgets, and more: TouchofModern.com . \nOf course, you want some specific suggestions to help navigate this new shopping territory, and we’re happy to oblige. So, without further ado, our must-haves for the modern dad: \nFor his new sense of style. The modern dad wants to look good, and you can help by purchasing him classy and sophisticated accoutrements. For instance, every modern man wears an attractive timepiece, and your dad will want one too. Find something simple and elegant that nonetheless speaks to his masculinity. And just in case you were wondering, no smartwatches. We know we said above that dads have become tech gurus, but that’s not the same things as a tech geek, and right now smartwatches can’t compete with the time-honored style of a classic timepiece . The modern dad also appreciates a pair of custom cufflinks, a personalized money clip, hip sunglasses, and dapper shoes . Any of the above will help him cultivate the suave, modern image he’s after. \nFor his tech obsession. Tech guru that he’s become, he already has a smartphone, a tablet, and a high-end laptop. So what else is there tech-wise that he could possibly need? Plenty, young grasshopper, plenty. How about a smartphone or tablet case hand carved from walnut (or any other wood you can think of)? How about an ergonomic Bluetooth mouse to help him eliminate needless cables and increase productivity while away from the office? Bluetooth speakers can make a great gift as well, and you can find them in novel shapes and various sizes. But make sure you don’t skimp when it comes to sound quality because your dad’s probably become something of an audiophile lately. And speaking of sound quality, studio-grade headphones might be just the thing for him. He’ll hear his music with a clarity and precision he never knew possible. \nFor his (finally) expanding mind. Yup, the dad in your life has said some pretty embarrassing, insensitive, offensive, and just plain dumb things over the years. But then one day he started reading the New York Times and the New Yorker. He started using words like entropy and ennui and you’re pretty sure you saw him come out of the bathroom one day with a copy of Gravity’s Rainbow in his hand. He’s cultured now. He’s stopped reading books written for moody teenagers about sexy vampires and preadolescent wizards and replaced them with, drumroll, Literary Fiction. So, why not encourage his newfound love of all things literary and cultured by getting him a gift card to your local independent bookseller? Or purchase him a subscription to one the nation’s leading literary magazines . \nYour dad’s all grown up now. He a classy, cultured, modern man of the world. It’s time you start treating him that way by purchasing him gifts that suits his new life. We hope the above suggestions will help you with that. And as we bid you farewell, let’s all take a moment to thank the heavens that we’ll never have to see our dads wear black socks with cargo shorts ever again. 0 Flares Facebook 0 Google+ 0   0 Twitter 0 0 Flares × ← Stay Beautiful with Cover Girl and Walmart #giveaway About Rob \nRob brings a new perspective to the once mommy blog.
