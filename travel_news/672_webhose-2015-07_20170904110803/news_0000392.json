Various instruments of credit that we are looking at,” said Kamath, who was here to attend the BRICS Summit in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi and leaders from other member countries participated.\n“Idea is that we will lend for developmental assistance in member countries,” said the former Independent Director of Infosys and former Chairman of ICICI Bank, who has been made the NDB President for five years.\nBRICS countries had decided last year to establish the Bank, with India getting the right to nominate the first President.\nAsked whether the NDB would consider lending to non-member countries, Kamath said, “We will primarily lend to member countries. In due course, we will look at opening membership, in the next few months.”\nSpecifically asked whether NDB could consider helping Greece which is in financial crisis, Kamath said, “I have no mandate to help any non-member… Beyond BRICS, I have no mandate.”\nAt the same time, he said, “We will talk to the Board of Governors to expand in due course.” The Board meeting is likely to take place later this month in Shanghai, the headquarter of NDB.\nKamath was asked to comment on a view that the BRICS bank has been set up to undermine the Dollar as it will lend in local currencies.\n“I will put it like this. In developing countries, particularly BRICS, there are pools of capital which can be tapped and lent. Local currency financing is what we will look at in addition to hard currency finance. We will look at all pools of capital in addition to hard currency,” he said.\nHe went on to add that local currency credit will protect the BRICS countries from currency fluctuations and volatility and “it is critical that we do it”.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, while justifying the setting up of NDB, recently said that “The international monetary system itself depends a lot on the US dollar, or, to be precise, on the monetary and financial policy of the US authorities. The BRICS countries want to change this.”\nKamath said the “main intent” of setting up the NDB is “to understand the borrowers’ mindset”.\nAsked what is that “mindset”, the NDB head said, “the borrowers’ mindset is â€“ please understand our challenges and lend accordingly. Don’t look at us from the western mindset which is that of developed countries.”\nQueried whether that is the mindset in existing institutions IMF and World Bank, he replied, “I think that is what the developing countries are feeling and that is what has been articulated. We will look at it clearly understanding ethos of the borrower.”\nHe maintained that the NDB will benefit the developing countries as the priority of the bank would be economic development of every single member country.\nKamath denied that NDB would compete with Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which was also set up recently.\n“We will work together and have collaboration and cooperation.”\nUnderlining that “structures” of the two banks are different, he said, “The world is changing and it is an opportunity to have cooperation.”\nIs $100 billion sufficient?\nIn response, Kamath said, “$100 billion is about the capital other large multilateral development banks have. So it is substantial capital. It will be used over a number of years.”\n 1:04 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T21:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T15:15:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
