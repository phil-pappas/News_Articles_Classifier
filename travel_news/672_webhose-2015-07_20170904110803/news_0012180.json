The one day event covered an excellent mix of practical exhibiting tips and must have business advice such as on-stand behaviour, data management, how to design the best stand for your budget, new ways of thinking about social media and how to humanise on stand engagement with visitors. \nAll of the sessions had an element of audience participation and engagement, keynote Han Leenhouts from Sales and Pepper went down a storm with the audience, many of whom will have gone away with Uptown Funk ringing in their ears from the interactive moments in Han’s presentation. The audience responded with an animated Q&A session led by Chair Simon Burton from Exposure Communications. Richard Mann, Market Development Director at the NEC, says: “The NEC has been 100% behind this event since it launched here in 2014 because we believe the success of exhibitors, organisers and venues is mutually dependant, and through the National Exhibitor Masterclass we can help contribute to strengthening a link in that chain. We are thrilled to have been the Strategic Partner of this year’s National Exhibitor Masterclass, and look forward to collaborating with the AEO and FaceTime again on future events.” There was a wide cross section of organisations represented in the audience from SMEs in the beauty and giftware sectors right up to large UK businesses such as JCB, Oxford University Press, the Scout Association, Severn Trent and Transport for London. Company representatives came from as far afield as Dublin, Glasgow and even Alicante in Spain to attend the event which was supported by ESSA and N200 a GES Company. Matt Coyne, Business Development Director at N200 says: “We sponsored the National Exhibitor Masterclass this year because we want exhibitors to understand that as well as tried and tested methods there are new ways of doing everything connected to exhibiting. Using the latest technology for example, enables you to capture leads and respond in real-time giving absolute control over your event data and the edge on your competition\" Andrew Harrison, Director at ESSA, says: “Another amazing Masterclass with hundreds of current and future exhibitors walking away with new ideas on how to activate their next exhibition presence ringing in their ears and hopefully a good number of them knowing where they will be sourcing their next event supplier or service provider from. We’re very proud partners of the event and well done FaceTime for continually providing a fresh and reinvigorated event for both delegates and supporters, a real industry standout event.” Jenni Jaques, Marketing Director of FaceTime, says: “We are delighted with initial feedback from delegates who have taken to Twitter to express what a thoroughly worthwhile day it was for them. We’re confident that each and every delegate took home some valuable insights and advice on how to enhance their exhibitor experience no matter from which sector or size of business.” FaceTime will be organising two further Exhibitor Masterclasses this year. The next one will be held at the ACC in Liverpool on 19th October and then the SECC on 26th November.
