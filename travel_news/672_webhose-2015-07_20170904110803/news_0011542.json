This could be a photo that represents a lifelong connection, a lasting tradition or perhaps it’s a structure that will stand the test of time. In your photographic eye – what does it mean to endure, to be indestructible, to last forever? Interpret the theme as broadly as you like and don’t forget to tell us where you took the shot. \nJudges \nYour work will be reviewed by former Time photo editor Erica Campbell, New York Times contributing photographer Jared Kohler and BBC Travel contributing editor Richard Conway. The winner will join the ranks as a BBC Travel Photo nomad and the winning shot will be featured on BBC.com. \nDeadline \nSubmissions will close Monday 13 July, and finalists will be announced the week of 20 July. Our judges will name a winner at the end of the month. \nNext month, we’ll be looking for photographs that best represent the theme of hot and cold. See last month’s finalists and the winner for the theme of epic travel selfies . \nExamples", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T23:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T02:41:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
