The seat on-board is assigned automatically.\nPassengers who travel with the new fare must check-in exclusively online at Alitalia.com, through the Alitalia app or in airports at fast check-in stations only.\nAriodante Valeri, Alitalia CCO said: “Light is a simple fare, clear and particularly convenient with average savings of 25% compared to base fares.\n“Light is not a seasonal promotional fare but a fixed component of the new Alitalia offer: an offer that meets the expectation of passengers who seek quality above all, as well as convenient prices for young travelers and small and medium business”.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-07-22T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T19:50:18.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
