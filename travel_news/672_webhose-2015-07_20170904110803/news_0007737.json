She lived, but was horribly disfigured.\nSix of the detainees were charged as suspected authors of the crime and the last as an accomplice, said Judge Mario Carroza.\nThe alleged authors are the former officers and non-commissioned officers that were in charge of the patrol that apparently set the youths on fire. The driver of the truck the others had ridden in is the accused accomplice, the judge said.\nAll seven were arrested on Wednesday after a former soldier came forward and testified about what happened during the protest march on July 2, 1986.\nThe case had been closed in the 1990s with just one military man being convicted, of negligence. The court accepted the argument that the two youths were burned after a homemade fire bomb exploded.\n“Maybe they were carrying something hidden and it exploded,” Pinochet said at the time.\nThe case was reopened in 2013 after a new lawsuit was filed by relatives of the two youths.\nRojas and Quintana were arrested that day in 1986 by a military patrol. They were allegedly doused with gasoline and set ablaze, then left for dead on the outskirts of the capital Santiago.\nRojas had just returned to Chile from the United States, where he had been living with his exiled mother. He died after four days of agony from his burns.\nQuintana suffered burns to 60 per cent of her body. She now lives in Canada.\n“I never lose faith in justice being done,” said Rojas’s mother Veronica de Negri. “But the wounds have not remained in the past.”\nPinochet seized power in 1973 in a military coup that overthrew president Salvador Allende, and ruled until 1990, although he stayed on for eight more years as head of the military, which gave him immunity from prosecution. Pinochet died in 2006.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T00:19:02.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
