The task of smartly accommodating and managing that population bulge requires an experienced, thoughtful Snohomish County executive.\nDave Somers is the best bet. He knows more about Snohomish County government than anyone. He was first elected to the County Commission in 1997 after a career as a fisheries biologist, including work for the Tulalip Tribes. He has chaired the County Council five times and developed keen budgeting skills in shepherding the county through the recession.\nThe Times recommends: Dave Somers\nSnohomish County executive\nStrengths : Strong knowledge about Snohomish County government; long record of public service\nSomers is a seasoned public official with an ability to both bridge ideological divides and to stand on principle when necessary. He would step quickly into the executive chair. ...\"\nHis expertise is deepest on land use and growth management. He differed with incumbent County Executive John Lovick, who is running for re-election, over recent updates to growth-management plans. Somers smartly seeks to channel growth into the urban core in Everett, which will eventually be served by light rail. Lovick’s recommendation would have encouraged more suburban sprawl.\nLovick’s long record of public service — in law enforcement and the Legislature — has not translated well into executive management. After the disastrous term of former County Executive Aaron Reardon, Lovick let too many Reardon accolades remain, beginning a pattern of poor personnel management. Lovick inherited massive cost overruns on a new courthouse, but then made his own mistakes as costs ballooned to $162 million. And Somers rightly criticizes Lovick for budget missteps, including leaving the county with a too-small reserve.\nSomers is a seasoned public official with an ability to both bridge ideological divides and to stand on principle when necessary. He would step quickly into the executive chair.\nDave Somers is the best candidate for Snohomish County executive.\nEditorial board members are editorial page editor Kate Riley, Frank A.
