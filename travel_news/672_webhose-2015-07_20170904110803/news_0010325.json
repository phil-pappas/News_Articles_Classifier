Writer Posted Jul. 29, 2015 at 11:01 AM Posted Jul. 29, 2015 at 11:01 AM Hannibal To say Mark Twain has international recognition is one thing; to prove it is quite another. And prove it they can, as the Hannibal Convention & Visitors Bureau announces visitors from 79 countries came to Hannibal in 2014 alone. “ Through partnership research opportunities, we have great avenues for tracking international visitors,” explains Gail Bryant, Director of the Hannibal Convention & Visitors Bureau. “Being able to show the number of countries that visit Hannibal is a testament to the international appeal of Hannibal’s greatest legacy; Mark Twain.” Canadian travelers ranked number one, with the United Kingdom, Mexico, Germany, China, Japan, Australia, Spain, Brazil and France rounding out the top 10. The number of countries that visit Hannibal is impressive for a logistical reason. “ Hannibal is a driving destination,” explains Bryant. “You cannot hop on a plane or take a passenger train to Hannibal. St. Louis, which is the nearest major metropolitan airport, is over 90 miles away, meaning visitors must drive to get here.” While the large number of countries represented may astonish some, those associated with the Hannibal tourism industry are not surprised. “ In the past few months alone, we served as host to journalist groups from Japan, Germany and all over the United States. Hannibal truly has a history to be proud of and a bright future ahead,” remarks Bryant. While Mark Twain draws visitors from around the world, the Hannibal Convention & Visitors Bureau is expecting to see more of a domestic crowd with many of the scheduled upcoming festivals and events.
