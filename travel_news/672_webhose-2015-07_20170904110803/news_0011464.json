Flannel and grunge were in style, so was the movie Clueless and Gansta Rap, not to mention the genesis of reality TV through MTV's The Real World . What's not to love? Shouldn't we bring it all back?The 10 years before Y2K also had some pretty epic TV series that, in many cases, lasted a decade or more. Let's indulge for a few minutes and reminisce on some classic 90s TV that have stuck with us. And while fans can watch re-runs of some of these shows on cable TV, Netflix ( NFLX ) , Amazon ( AMZN ) and other services, wouldn't it be great if these shows returned? Already we are seeing '90s favorites like The X-Files and Twin Peaks being revived (though Twin Peaks , which was initially scheduled to return on CBS ' ( CBS ) Showtime in 2016, has already been pushed back to 2017 ), but there are so many more great shows we wish would come back. \nOn the heels of our story, 5 Cancelled Shows That Are Returning and 13 We Wish Would Come Back , here are 12 shows that TheStreet chose as particular favorites from the decade. Of course this list is in no way complete. But after careful consideration, we came up with these 12 hits that we really wish media executives would revive. Check them out. \n1. Family Matters \nWho could forget nerdy Steve Urkel's high-waisted pants held with suspenders, thick glasses and his high-pitched, completely annoying, nasal tone? Urkel (played by Jaleel White) became the breakout star of Family Matters , one of the longest running sitcoms with an African-American cast . \nMust Read: The 10 Best TV Shows of All Time \nFamily Matters aired for nine seasons, from 1989 to 1998, and was actually a spin off from a classic 80s sitcom, Perfect Strangers. It was definitely a part of the line-up for must-watch Friday night television viewing -- what used to be a big night for network TV. Family Matters was first aired on Disney's ( DIS ) ABC and then later on CBS. \nFamily Matters centered on the Winslow's, a middle-class black family that lived in Chicago. The main characters included Carl Winslow, a policeman, his strong-willed wife, Harriette (who also played a recurring role as the elevator operator for the Chicago Chronicle in Perfect Strangers ), children -- Eddie, Laura and Judy (and later an adopted son) as well as Carl's mother, Estelle and Harriette's sister and child who all lived in the same house. But it was dorky, next door neighbor, Steve Urkel , who stole the show and the reason fans kept coming back each week. 1 of 12", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T17:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T20:07:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
