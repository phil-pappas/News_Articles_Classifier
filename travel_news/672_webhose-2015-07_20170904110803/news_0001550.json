John Hawkridge, owner of the Gallipot Inn in Upper Hartfield, placed a discarded bus sign it in front of his pub, with a pub flyer in place of the usual timetable. He told the East Grimstead Courier that he found the sign in a hedge: \"I found the sign outside the Queen's Arms in Cowden – it had been taken down because the stop was thought dangerous – so it had been stuck in a hedge for a year, I just moved it and put it outside.\" To his surprise, not only did customers start waiting outside the bus stop, the local bus company - Metrobus - replaced the flier with an official bus timetable and began recognising it as part of the route. The Gallipot Inn (Facebook) Hawkridge said: \"I just thought it would be good to have a bus stop by the pub. I put it there, I put in my own sign, and a couple of customers started queuing up and buses started stopping.” \"We are now getting customers bussing in from Tunbridge Wells and Crawley.\" Although the bus stop remains unofficial, bus drivers are happy to stop if hailed outside the Gallipot Inn. Metrobus is currently lobbying East Sussex County Council to make the stop official. Metrobus spokeman Nick Hill said: \"For many years, buses have stopped on request on a ‘hail and ride’ basis near the Gallipot Inn and we have been asking the county council to install fixed stops to make it clearer to potential passengers that buses stop there.\" \"Unfortunately the council has been unable to do this. While the stop provided by the pub is welcome, it hasn’t been formally recognised by the council and is therefore unofficial, but buses continue to stop in the vicinity.\" Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T20:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T14:52:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
