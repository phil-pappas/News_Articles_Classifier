(Bill O'Leary/WASHINGTON POST) By Jane Touzalin July 1 at 7:39 AM Follow @janetouzalin Time marches on, and so does Tom Sietsema : This week he continues his crawl of America’s Best Food Cities with a visit to Portland, Ore., where world-class local ingredients have helped to create a vibrant yet laid-back restaurant culture. There’s a story , a video , a gallery of photos , even a couple of recipes .\nAlso in Food this week: Kristen Hartke explores cheese as a seasonal phenomenon , its flavors shaped by whether the cow, sheep or goat ate warm-weather grasses or cold-weather hay. And Spirits columnist M. Carrie Allan tells us why, this Fourth of July, one of the most American things you can drink comes from Spain.\n[More Chat Leftovers: Easy-peel eggs ; the perfect white wine for a wedding ]\nSo settle in for some great reading, but don’t forget to set your Fitbit alarm for noon, when we kick off this week’s Free Range chat . Portland, cheese, the Fourth or anything else in the culinary world you want to discuss is fair game, so come with questions or comments. To help warm you up, here’s a leftover question from last week’s chat :\nI’d like to do a “campfire” dessert to end an adult dinner party: maybe something beyond s’mores. Any creative or interesting ideas? Bonus points if it is something each person can do themselves around the fire. The good part is that this would be outside our house, so we are not constrained by ingredients or tools that would need to be hiked in or stored in a camp cooler.\nI thought and thought, but you know what? I just couldn’t think of anything that’s more fun than making s’mores. You get to feel like a kid again, and then you get to eat something warm and sweet and gooey. How can it be wrong?\nSo here’s my suggestion: a s’mores bar for adults. You start with the three traditional basic ingredients — graham crackers, marshmallows, chocolate. Maybe you upgrade a little, with homemade graham crackers ( these , or maybe these ) and with homemade marshmallows, whether plain or peppermint . Or what the heck, maybe you just pick them up at the store. You’ll need good-quality chocolate; semisweet or bittersweet would add that adult note.\nThen you provide interesting substitutions or add-ins that your guests can try. Here are some ideas for what can go under the marshmallow and between the grahams: Nutella, peanut butter, caramel sauce, pumpkin butter, lemon or lime curd, berry preserves, banana slices, white chocolate, toasted coconut, nuts.\nThen you mix and match. How about chocolate, peanut butter, marshmallow? Pumpkin butter and marshmallow, as in our Round-the-Grill Pumpkin-Butter S’mores ? Chocolate, banana, caramel sauce, marshmallow? White chocolate, fruit preserves, marshmallow? Or my personal favorite, lemon curd and marshmallow: I swear, it tastes just like a lemon meringue pie.\nAnd finally, let me point you toward the Bon Appétit Web site, where local pastry chef Tiffany MacIsaac of Buttercream Bakeshop demonstrates how to make", "external_links": ["http://www.dakotalayers.com/index.php/news/chat-leftovers-easy-peel-eggs-2/", "https://twitter.com/@janetouzalin"], "published": "2015-07-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T14:58:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
