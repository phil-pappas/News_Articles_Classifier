Your Right to Know Justices refuse to hear coal magnate's defamation appeal By Andrew Jacobs THE NEW YORK TIMES • Sunday July 19, 2015 12:44 AM \nBEIJING — Nine foreign tourists who were detained in northern China this month after the police accused them of watching illegal videos in their hotel have been allowed to return to their home countries, according to the South African government and an aid group that worked for their release. \nThe tourists — five South Africans, three Britons and an Indian — were expected to fly out of Ordos on Saturday, following 11 fellow travelers who had been freed earlier. \nThe police claimed that some of the travelers had been watching “terrorist propaganda videos” in their rooms at the Crowne Plaza Ordos. The tourists were on a 47-day luxury tour of China. \nOne of the tourists, Hoosain Jacobs, 74, said the video in question was a documentary about Genghis Khan that had been purchased at a tourist site dedicated to the 13th-century Mongolian leader.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T07:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T07:48:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
