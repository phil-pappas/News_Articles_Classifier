Requires iOS8 or later.\n>> Cost: $1.99\n>> What it does : Tells you exactly when a photographer’s coveted “morning magic hour” (sunrise) and “evening magic hour” (sunset) will occur at a specified destination around the world.\n>> What’s hot : I’m an amateur photographer, so I know that the soft light at sunset and sunrise is best for taking photos. The attractive and easy-to-use Lumy app lets you set a calendar for your location and date and enables notifications alerting you to when the golden hours occur. It also gives you a heads up about the weather for even better planning. If you’re ready to step up your photography skills, you can double tap the main screen and get seven more photo-centric times such as morning astronomical twilight or evening nautical twilight, to name two. My favorite part? You can access the information offline.\n>> What’s not: I accidentally missed a “morning magic hour” in Rome because it was too easy to sleep through the 4:30 a.m. notification. For me the information is incredibly useful, but I need to set an alarm. If I had one request for the developer, it would be a community home where Lumy app users could share their photos.\n———\nJay Leo, Los Angeles Times\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T07:47:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
