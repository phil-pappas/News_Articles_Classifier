Expect more add-on fees \nCharges for checked bags, entertainment, food and seats with extra legroom, among other extras, generated $38.1 billion for the world's airlines in 2014, a 21-percent increase from the previous year, according to a report from IdeaWorks, a Wisconsin-based airline consulting firm. \nBut you can expect such revenue to continue to soar as airlines consider adopting even more fees. \nHow about a fee that ensures your bag is delivered at the baggage carousel before all the others? \nOr a charge to let you be the first to exit your plane? \nHow about a charge to put a radio frequency identification tag on your luggage so you can track its location in real time from your smartphone? \nThese were among the extras that at least 60 percent of travelers said they were willing to pay for, according to a survey of 2,339 business and leisure travelers by Flightview, a Boston-based flight information firm. An even higher rate of millennials, 75 percent, said they were willing to pay such fees. \nAmong other fees travelers would be willing to pay, according to the survey, are flight status alerts that are automatically sent to family, employers, hotels and others; a smartphone app to let you pre-order food and drinks at airport eateries; in-seat charging stations for mobile devices; and a rental car service to pick you up at the terminal curb. \nSome airlines already offer a few of these services, and others may be ready to adopt them in the future, said Flightview spokeswoman Katherine Wellman. \n\"We just wanted to pass along to airlines what people really want,\" she said of the survey. \nUnited Airlines pays out 'bug bounties' \nIn a first for a U.S. carrier, United Airlines has paid out \"bug bounties\" to cybersecurity experts who found and exposed weaknesses in the airline's website. \nTwo cybersleuths were each paid 1 million loyalty reward miles for uncovering gaps in the airline's Web security. \nThe Chicago-based carrier announced it would pay out the bounty in May, a few weeks before the latest of several technical glitches grounded flights for nearly 90 minutes. \nUnited officials say the \"bug bounty\" program was an idea that the airline borrowed from technology companies in Silicon Valley that also offer rewards to anyone who can identify cybersecurity gaps. \nAt United, the bounties are paid on a sliding scale based on the severity of the security gap, with 1 million reward miles paid to whoever can find an opening that allows someone to execute computer codes at the United website from a remote server. \nThat reward should pay for about three first-class round-trip tickets to Europe from the U.S.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T23:34:53.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
