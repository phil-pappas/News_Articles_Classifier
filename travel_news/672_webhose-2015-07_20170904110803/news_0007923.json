Maeve Higgins Sharon McGowan â€“ 22 July 2015 03:00 AM\nThe Cork funnywoman revealed to the Herald that she will feature in hit science panel show StarTalk, which airs on the National Geographic Channel this autumn.\n\"It's hosted by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, who runs the observatory in the National History Museum [in New York],\" Maeve explained.\n\"It's like a science pop-culture show and they have a comedian co-host. I'm not a scientist, I didn't even do any science subjects in school so it's my job to ask questions and be funny.\n\"Basically, it's me and two scientists talking about anything to do with science or maths. I love it and we tape it in the observatory in the National History Museum, so it's really cool,\" she added.\nWhile she's loving life in the States, the former Naked Camera star will return to Dublin this week to perform in the Vodafone Comedy Festival, which kicks off in the Iveagh Gardens tomorrow.\n\"I'm looking forward to getting home. The festival is great - as comedians we love it,\" Maeve said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T12:28:56.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
