Some Dutch appear not to have any curtains at all. The ample Dutch windows become an unabashed showcase for the people and possessions inside. Yet, ironically to some, it's considered impolite to stare inside. What is the rationale behind this unusual cultural tendency? \nDutch friends have furnished me with either one of two explanations. The most immediately obvious - especially as you take a surreptitious peek at the interiors of some of Amsterdam's fantastic canal houses - is that the owners simply want to show off. An alternative, and more frequent explanation is that the open curtains indicate that the family has nothing to hide - a reflection of the country's Calvinist undercurrents, and a token of the well-known Dutch tendency toward openness. Personally, I leave my curtains open in the daytime because I need all the light I can get on particularly cloudy Dutch days, but draw them as dusk approaches. \nIn the end, there's no consensus as to how this common tendency arose - only that it's a prevalent phenomenon to this day. But be a discrete peek into a handsome canal house or a full-on view into a chic houseboat from the water, both visitors and locals seem to relish the stealthy glances they can steal into the lives on the other side of the windows.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T14:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T02:39:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
