The hospitality company, which is one of the largest in the world, has agreed to become an official launch partner for United’s Eco-Skies CarbonChoice corporate carbon offset program. The Eco-Skies CarbonChoice program enables the airline’s corporate customers to track and offset the emissions stemming from their business travel and freight shipments on United at the enterprise level. \n“As the only U.S. airline to offer a corporate carbon offset program, United’s CarbonChoice program represents another way for us to broaden and partner with our customers on environmental initiatives outside of our normal business relationship,” said Angela Foster-Rice, Managing Director of Environmental Affairs at United Airlines. “This program underscores United’s efforts to lead commercial aviation as an environmentally responsible company and we are thrilled to help play a role in Wyndham Worldwide’s carbon footprint reduction efforts.” \nThrough the CarbonChoice program, participating corporate customers receive customized enterprise-level carbon emissions reports and can purchase offsets to counterbalance the emissions associated with their transport, effectively allowing them to ship and travel carbon neutral on United. United’s industry leading corporate offset program uses actual flight level data – recognizing aircraft type, routes, fuel consumption, payload, and customer-specific business travel and cargo shipments on United. The carbon offsets are available through United’s partnership with global NGO Sustainable Travel International and enable participants to support projects designed to help reduce greenhouse gases as well as provide social and economic benefits to communities where those projects are located. \n“Our commitment to sustainability extends across all facets of the Company,” said Joanne McNellis Coelho, senior manager, Global Travel at Wyndham. “At Wyndham Worldwide, practicing sustainability doesn’t just mean turning off the lights or using low flow faucets, it’s about being innovative and working with colleagues across all functions of the Company and with key supply chain partners to make a difference. We are excited to be one of the first members of United’s CarbonChoice program.” \nWyndham Worldwide is a hospitality industry leader in sustainability and social responsible practices and has been named to both the Dow Jones North America and World Sustainability Indices; recognized by CDP, the world’s largest global environmental disclosure system; and rated among the 2015 World’s Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Magazine, Corporate Responsibility Magazine’s 100 Best Corporate Citizens, and DiversityInc’s Top 50 Companies for Diversity. \nWyndham’s corporate offset purchase will be invested in the GreenTrees' Advanced Carbon Restored Ecosystem (ACRE) project along the Mississippi River Valley. To date, GreenTrees and its landowners have planted over 36 million trees on nearly 100,000 acres along the Mississippi Alluvial. \nUnited’s carbon offset projects have obtained independent third-party verification and are registered with long-standing, well-respected carbon offset programs. \nUnited’s Eco-Skies Commitment to the Environment \nUnited Airlines is committed to leading commercial aviation as an environmentally responsible company by taking actions today that shape an environmentally sustainable future. Through various fuel efficiency measures, in 2014 alone the company saved more than 100 million gallons of fuel, resulting in a reduction of more than one million metric tons of CO2 emissions. Since 1994, United has improved its fuel efficiency by 33 percent. United is also a leader in the advancement and use of alternative fuels, making history in commercial aviation with its partnership with AltAir Fuels to bring commercial-scale, cost-competitive renewable jet fuel to its Los Angeles hub later this year and its $30 million equity investment in Fulcrum BioEnergy, a pioneer in the development and commercialization of converting municipal solid waste into low-cost sustainable aviation biofuel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T20:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:14:15.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
