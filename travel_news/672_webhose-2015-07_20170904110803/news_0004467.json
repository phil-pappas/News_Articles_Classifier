Today it possesses the world’s only, wholly-owned fibre ring around the world – consisting of more than 500,000km of subsea fibre and more than 210,000km of terrestrial fibre. Further, 80 per cent of the world’s mobile operators use Tata Communications’ network (equating to four out of every five mobile subscribers). Tata Communications is the only Tier 1 internet services provider that is in the top five by routes in five continents. It also connects businesses to the giant clouds of Microsoft Azure, Google and Amazon Web Services, which collectively account for almost 50 per cent of cloud computing. 1868 Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata, regarded as the legendary “father of Indian industry”, founds Tata Companies, which soon becomes one of the country’s largest and most respected business conglomerates. 1986 Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL), India’s leading incumbent telecoms provider, is founded. 2002 Tata Companies acquires a 45 per cent stake in VSNL, forming a truly powerful partnership. A year later, VSNL International, the global arm of VSNL, is launched; 2002 is considered as Tata Communications’ founding year. 2005 VSNL acquires Tyco Global Network, one of the world’s largest providers of submarine cable bandwidth. The following year VSNL buys Teleglobe, growing its global reach, operational strengths and deep carrier relationships. 2008 VSNL, VSNL International, CIPRIS, Tata Indicom Enterprise Business Unit and Teleglobe unite as Tata Communications. 2009 Tata Communications, along with Tyco Telecommunications, completes a private Intra-Asia submarine cable system and a direct fibre path between Singapore and Tokyo. It is named the TGN-Intra Asia Cable System. 2010 The company opens the state-of-the-art $180 million (£116 million) Tata Communications Exchange (TCX), based in Singapore. With 66,000 square foot of data centre space, the hub increases capacity for both domestic and international firms. 2012 Tata Communications becomes the official connectivity provider for Formula One, capping 10 years of privatisation. The company also completes the world's first wholly owned cable network ring around the globe. 2013 The company brings 100G connectivity to carriers and enterprises across the US and Europe. In the same year, it enters a new partnership with Mercedes AMG Petronas, the F1 team, which sees the delivery of world-class trackside connectivity for the team at all races using the Tata Communications’ global network. It continues to provide communications and data to F1. 2014 Looking to strengthen bonds with motorsport, Tata Communications launches The F1 Connectivity Innovation Prize with a grand prize of $50,000 (£32,000). The company also releases its IZO platform to drive hybrid cloud adoption, and announces a $20 million (£12 million) deal with the KION Group, the global manufacturer of forklift trucks and warehouse technology, to provide global connectivity to the group’s 330 sites and 22,000 employees across 30 countries worldwide. Annual revenue grows to $3.2 billion (£2.1 billion) in 2013-14, with 77 per cent generated outside of India. 2015 The company is positioned as a “leader” in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Network Services, Global for a second time. Nearly one-quarter of the world’s internet routes travel over Tata Communications’ network. The company signs its first UK advertising sponsorship deal with the Heathrow Express to illustrate its role in connecting people and businesses around the world.
