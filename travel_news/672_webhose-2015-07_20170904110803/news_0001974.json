Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Jul 10, 2015 Adv: \nThe new Mirama Hills one-stop border post between Rwanda and Uganda, one of now 13 in the East African region, was during the week handed over to the border, security, and customs agencies from the 2 countries now manning the new facility. \nFunded by Trade Mark East Africa is it one of the measures taken to improve the flow of goods when trading across the region but also encourages additional travel activities by cutting down on red tape and unnecessary bureaucracy when crossing the border. Citizens of Uganda and Rwanda can travel from one country to the other using ID cards or in the Ugandan case even voter’s cards after passport requirements were abandoned when the Northern Corridor Integration Projects countries fast-tracked the movement of people and goods, something the East African Community at large had for long failed to do. \nMirama Hills is the nearest border crossing between the two countries for travelers coming from Uganda. The area is expected to also see the new Standard Gauge Railway line from the border of Uganda with Kenya, via Kampala and on to Kigali, built here and due to the terrain not likely go on to Kabale from where the Gatuna border is nearest. \nRoad developments on both sides of the border linking Uganda and Rwanda have also taken place, making travel by road easier; many people use buses between the two countries. \nThe cost of the new border post was given as just under US$8 million and was constructed by Uganda’s Dott Services construction company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T07:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T07:41:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
