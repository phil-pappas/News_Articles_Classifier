Those who love baseball may want to heed the Wizard’s warning before opening this book. \nIt may tell them things about the American pastime they would rather not know. In “The Grind,” Barry Svrluga, a sports writer for The Washington Post, had access to Washington National players and staff, including wives of players, and has compiled an enlightening inside look at the world of professional baseball. \nWatching the Nats play on a sunny afternoon, one may envy those frisky fellows who seem to be having fun while making big money. In fact, they are having fun, and most of them are making good money, but they are acutely aware of being at the top of a slippery pyramid. There is a steady drumbeat of personnel turnover due to injuries, poor performance, trades and a host of other factors. \nThe prospect of sudden removal is a source of constant anxiety to the players, especially those with families who must either uproot themselves from their homes or wave goodbye to daddy for a prolonged period of time.
