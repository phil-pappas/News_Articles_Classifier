Today, sisters Lissa and Claire Christie run the yoga activities.\nThere's no electricity or Internet on the island, making the retreat suitable for those looking for a digital detox -- or an escape from the negative headlines about Greece.\nIt's eco-friendly too.\nTwo houses, the Main House and the Villa, provide accommodation for only a handful of people at a time.\nThere are just five simply but beautifully decorated twin rooms.\nThere's also a lighthouse, a small church, 2,000 olive trees and numerous paths spreading along Silver Island's 60 acres.\nIts name, \"Silver,\" stems from the shimmering leaves of the plentiful olive trees.\nTwo hourly yoga classes per day take place in the open air, overlooking the ocean.\nThe outdoors and indoor dining space, where vegetarian and organic meals are served, enjoy equally gorgeous views.\nSilver Island ; +27 72 624 2242\nItha108 Yoga Studio - Ithaki\nDiscreet luxury: Itha108 Yoga Studio Tucked away in Piso Aetos, on the mystical island of Ithaki, this discreetly luxurious retreat is the creation of Ingrid Gottschalk.\n\"When I am on my own I sit quietly and let the energy talk to me. It is a healing and creative energy, exactly what I felt when I saw the land for the first time\", says Gottschalk.\nEach of the six bedrooms has been designed individually.\nAll of them are en-suite and air-conditioned, with mosquito nets, wood paneled ceilings and balconies with clear views across the Ionian Sea towards Kefalonia island.\nTraditional craftsmanship from India's Rajasthan state is used to decorate the venue.\nThere are also three Mongolian yurts available for one to four people, one of which has a removable roof cap, perfect for stargazing.\nItha108 offers walk-in classes for the public during the fall, winter and spring months.\nFrom May to September there are numerous retreats taking place, during which the yoga shalas are closed to the public.\nYoga classes take place in the two yoga shalas -- one outdoors and one indoors.\nDuring the cooler months, the indoor yoga shala benefits from underfloor heating while the outdoor shala \"Sundara\" is shaded by trees and cooled by Ionian sea breezes.\nItha108 , Agios Ioannis, 28300 Ithaca;
