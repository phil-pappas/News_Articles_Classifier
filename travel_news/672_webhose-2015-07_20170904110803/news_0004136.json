The country is eighth in the region in mobile transactions: 3.7 percent of the population use them.\nDownload a summary (Spanish only) of ABC’s survey results here .", "external_links": ["http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/globalfindex"], "published": "2015-07-23T22:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:54:00.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
