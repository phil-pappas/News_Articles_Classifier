Bangkok Don Muang (DMK) continued to deliver the highest growth among major airports, surging 49.6 per cent. \n\nThough passenger traffic remained resilient, the lull in trade activities and air freight traffic may put downward pressures on business travels in the coming months, said ACI in a press release.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T11:42:56.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
