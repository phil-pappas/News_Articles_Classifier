This time Spanish architects José Selgas and Lucía Cano are the team behind the design - an effervescent, candy-coloured tunnel - that drew inspiration from an unlikely source: the London Underground. Speaking to the Telegraph about their intentions, the designers said: “We like the way the Underground brings everyone together…We wanted to bring that feeling here, so we’ve created a very open space with lots of entry points and it’s up to you to find your corner.” You can learn more about their intentions, and see the pavilion for yourself, in our video .
