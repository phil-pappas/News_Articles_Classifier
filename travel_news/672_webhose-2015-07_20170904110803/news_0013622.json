Launching July 6, 2015, the OLife Advantage program streamlines and unifies all of Oceania Cruises’ advanced booking incentives, giving all guests who book a veranda stateroom category or above the same collection of complimentary amenities, including free shore excursions, unlimited internet and pre-paid gratuities.\n“We are excited to introduce this new simplified promotion strategy, which we created based on feedback received from our loyal guests and travel agent partners,” shared Jason Montague, president and chief operating officer for Oceania Cruises. “With the OLife Advantage we’re further incentivizing guests to book early with an incredible new value package of complimentary amenities, which include unlimited internet access so guests can stay connected with friends and family back home and free shore excursions to delve more deeply into history, culture, art and cuisine of the destinations visited.”\n“Equally important,” added Montague, “this simple and all-encompassing promotion allows us to focus on our travel partners, empowering them with the confidence to encourage their clients to book early for the best possible value.”\nOceania Cruises sets the standard with creative, destination-rich itineraries featuring ample time ashore and multiple overnights, so guests can explore some of the world’s most fascinating locales at their leisure. The OLife Advantage program provides three free excursions per person on sailings up to nine days, four free excursions on journeys between 10 and 13 days, and five free excursions on itineraries 14 days or more. Guests sailing on the OLife Advantage program have a wide variety of shore excursion to choose from, including a scenic visit to Ravello in Amalfi/Positano, a walking tour of Tallinn, Estonia and sea kayaking to Eagle Island in Ketchikan, Alaska.\n“As destination experts, the Oceania Cruises’ fleet sails to some of the most picturesque and iconic destinations around the globe,” explained Montague. “The free excursions offered with our new OLife Advantage program will allow guests to further immerse themselves in these incredible destinations, helping to make their cruise vacation more complete and satisfying their desire to discover new places.”\nGuests will be able to take advantage of the free Internet either through the ship’s Wi-Fi system or at the Oceania@Sea Internet café. Oceania Cruises recently upgraded the Wi-Fi system across its fleet to provide connectivity throughout the entire ship, including all public spaces, outdoor decks and all suites and staterooms.\nThe OLife Advantage program extends to all spring, summer and fall 2016 voyages in Europe, Alaska and Canada/New England. To qualify for the complimentary shore excursions, free unlimited internet and pre-paid gratuities, guests must book a veranda stateroom category or above before Sept. 30, 2015.\nThe summer 2016 collection also includes the highly anticipated maiden season for Sirena, the newest addition to the Oceania Cruises fleet. The expanded six-ship fleet provides Oceania Cruises even greater flexibility to create an unprecedented number of new itineraries for the upcoming season, offering a perfect fusion of classic and off-the-beaten-path ports. The summer 2016 itineraries, all available for the OLife Advantage program, will capture the imagination of even the most seasoned traveler.\nRelated Posts TripAdvisor touches mark of 100 million downloads for free app for iPhone and Android Jason Pomeranc, hotelier announces launch of new brand of hotel Sixty Hotels Amawaterways Introduces More Opportunities dor Solo Travelers Helsingborg Launches Destiantion Video Pixie-Dusted Disney Cruise Line Offers Fun for Families and Guests of all Ages", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T13:11:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
