The site features a booking platform that is highly visible, quick and easy for potential guests to book in two simple steps.\nIts easy-to-use interface and content management system (CMS) allows the Brudenell to edit and upload rates, promotions and events faster than ever before. In addition, the booking module is PCI compliant and provides a safe and secure method of storing and processing credit card details.\nDelighted with their new website Peter Osborne, General Manager at the Brudenell Hotel said; “We are confident the customer friendly navigation and new booking facility will generate more direct bookings. We will be able to set and manage live rates so guests can be assured of the best possible prices on our website. With the facility to add promotions and events ourselves from the CMS, the site will always be up-to-date and optimised to generate additional revenue.\n“As more lookers are converted into bookers we look forward to a reduction in online travel agencies (OTA) commissions and a corresponding increase in our rate of return. Looking ahead, we expect higher occupancy levels and an increase in room rates”, adds Peter.\nPhil Davidson, Managing Director at Guestline, commented; “With nearly half the visitors to OTAs also going directly to the hotel’s website, it is imperative hotels have eye-catching, easy to navigate pages to convert these visitors into customers.\nSource:-Brudenell Hotel\nRelated Posts TripAdvisor 40% reduction in room rates in Grand Hyatt Taipei in July and August Express your love this Valentine’s Day at Calabash Cove Resort & Spa Akaryn Hospitality Management Services Selects Agilysys Solution Suite", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T16:13:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
