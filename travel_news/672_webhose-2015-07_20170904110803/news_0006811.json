But all three options were described as “credible” in the report, offering Gatwick some optimism - at least publicly - that it could still eventually win the day. \nThe report estimates that a new Heathrow runway will boost theUK economy by £147 billion by 2050, whereas Gatwick was only likely to add £89 billion to GDP. The commission stresses that this was largely down to Heathrow’s ability to attract long-haul routes (the airport now hosts 70% of the UK’s long-haul flights), while Gatwick has “more heavily focused on the short-haul market”. \n“The north-west runway scheme is technically feasible and does not involve massive, untested infrastructure,” said Davies. “The costs are high, but financeable by the private sector.” \nIn a bid to assuage protests by local residents and their MPs, the commission has suggested measures to limit the impact of a larger Heathrow, including a ban on night flights between 11.30pm and 6am, and a series of measures to curb noise and ensure “acceptable” air quality around the airport. \nThe commission also stressed that there should be no fourth runway. \nResponding to the publication of the report last week, McLoughlin promised he would “provide clear direction on the government’s plans” in the autumn, adding: “We will need to decide on the best way for achieving planning consents quickly and fairly if expansion is to go ahead.” \nWhile this may sound positive for supporters of runway expansion - and that includes most of the major travel companies and bodies - battle lines have already been drawn in the House of Commons. \nHardened opponents of Heathrow expansion within the Conservative party, including London Mayor Boris Johnson and his potential successor Zac Goldsmith, were quick to express their dismay at the decision. All those in favour… \nThose supportive of a third runway tend to be less vocal but are believed to include chancellor George Osborne. Cameron, though, is in a tricky position after insisting in 2009 that the third runway was “not going ahead - no ifs, no buts”. \nLabour’s interim leader Harriet Harman has already spoken in favour of Heathrow’s third runway. But MP and London mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan is one of the party’s leading opponents of Heathrow expansion. \nThe industry will now have to wait to see how the government handles such a divisive issue within its own ranks. There have been suggestions that having a “free” vote with “cross-party consensus” in the Commons may be the way a third runway ultimately gets approval. \nThis would bring the block of 56 Scottish National Party MPs into play - they are already looking to ensure more flights between Scottish airports and an expanded Heathrow. SNP transport spokesperson Drew Hendry was quick to suggest these flights should be protected by law to stop the “here today, gone tomorrow service so often suffered by the Scottish public”. \nThese are just the first skirmishes in the latest battle over airport expansion in the south-east, but are we any closer to seeing a new runway being built? Aviation experts seem to be cautiously optimistic - mainly due to the comprehensive nature of the commission’s report. \nJohn Strickland, from JLS Consulting, said: “It’s a decisive and unanimous verdict for Heathrow - I don’t think Gatwick is in the running any more. Davies has given politicians a good framework to try to ensure they can’t wriggle out of it. I’m more optimistic because the report is really thorough and has gone deep into all the issues. \n“I think there’s more awareness across the parties of the need to have more aviation capacity. But we’re only at the end of the beginning - the next few months are going to be key.” \nJohn Grant, executive vice-president at aviation data specialist OAG, agreed the report provided a “set of measurable criteria” rather than relying on “presumptions and assumptions”, adding: “It will take a brave politician to turn away from the recommendations of a commission that they set up. But it will take a long time and we’re still at least 10 years away from having a new runway.” \nThere seem to be some grounds for hope that a new runway may be built some time in the 2020s, but there are evidently many hurdles to clear before we reach that point. \nFirst, the politicians will have to come up with a decision. And after that, there will be the inevitable planning inquiries and appeals, as well as the likely legal challenges from residents’ groups and other interested parties. Timeline: ﻿A history of airport indecision \n1935: Gatwick’s first terminal is built - known as “The Beehive” - with its first scheduled flights beginning the following year using landing strips made of grass. \n1944: Construction of the two runways at London Airport (the original name for Heathrow) begins on the site of a former RAF airbase. \n1946: London Airport officially starts operations as a civilian airport on January 1 - this is the last time a full-length runway opened at a commercial airport in south-east England. \n1950: Gatwick officially designated as London’s second airport. \n1968: Roskill Commission set up to look at whether a third London airport is needed to “cater for growth of traffic”. Two years later, the commission eventually recommends a new airport at Cublington in Buckinghamshire. \n1971: Conservative government agrees that there is a need for a new airport but prefers a site at Maplin Sands, Essex, instead of Cublington. \n1974: Maplin Sands project is abandoned by Labour government as it says no new runways are needed in the London area until 1990. \n1979: Gatwick signs a legal agreement with West Sussex County Council promising not to build a second runway before 2019. \n1990: Department for Transport sets up a study after CAA warns a new runway will be needed by 2005. \n1995: Options for new runways at Heathrow and Gatwick are rejected by the government. \n2003: The Future of Air Transport white paper backs a new runway at Stansted and a third at Heathrow. \n2009: Labour government confirms support for a third runway at Heathrow. \n2010: Heathrow’s third runway is cancelled by the newly elected coalition government. \n2012: Government appoints Sir Howard Davies to lead Airports Commission to look at hub runway capacity. \n2013: The commission whittles 50 proposals into three shortlisted options - two at Heathrow and a second at Gatwick. \n2015: Final report is published recommending a new runway at Heathrow but Gatwick remains a “credible” option. Readers' comments (1) Alan Bowen | Thu, 9 Jul 2015 1:00 pm \nIt is very difficult to see a political solution that will be acceptable to a substantial number of Cabinet ministers and with his attempts at re negotiating with Europe likely to take up most of his time, the PM is unlikely to want to start a major internal row. The Conservatives put off the whole issue for years with the Davies Report, and got elected as a result, I suspect Mr Cameron will look for another trick to push the idea into the long grass long enough for him to retire in 5 years time. Any runway is probably so far ahead that I will never see it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T12:12:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
