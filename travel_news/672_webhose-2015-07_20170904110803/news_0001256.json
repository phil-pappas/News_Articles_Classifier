I'm soon among the eager crowd queuing up at the theme park, stowing away in lockers our bags, eyeglasses, cameras and anything else that's too loose to withstand the centrifugal force. This is my second visit to the five-year-old Universal Singapore. The first time, in 2011, I suffered an unexpected courage malfunction after a friend described one of the double-track rides, Cylon, as \"unbearably scary\". So I sampled only the kinder, more humane ride called the Human. But this time I'm determined to soothe my inner chicken and get on board both rides, a feat of derring-do collectively dubbed Battlestar Galactica: Human vs Cylon. Universal Studios Singapore is a part of Resorts World Sentosa, spanning 49 hectares and also featuring the SEA Aquarium (one of the world's largest), Adventure Cove Waterpark and Dolphin Island. Other attractions include a Maritime Experiential Museum, an award-winning destination spa, a casino, a convention centre, celebrity chefs' restaurants and six different hotels plus the new Genting Hotel Jurong just outside the complex. The word among thrill-seekers is that Battlestar Galactica has emerged from its nearly two-year closure (\"for review\" was the official excuse) with brand-new passenger vehicles - strung in trains that seem to be barely clinging to their tracks - and promises of faster speeds and even greater turbulence. The queues are enormous, but I've got a Universal Express ticket for the fast lane and I'm soon at the boarding platform. I board the Human first to make sure I'm really ready for the scarier Cylon. Not that the Human ride isn't terrifying enough, as I well remember. But past experience has hardened me and I find I don't even need to close my eyes on the deep plunges. A friend watching from below tells me later, \"You were smiling!\" Duly toughened up by what's touted as a \"bearable level of heart-stopping ups and downs\", I jump aboard the Cylon with no hesitation - even though half the passengers getting off are looking awfully pale. The ride begins and in no time we're hurtling along at immense speed, spiralling, turning and twisting. There are moments I can't be sure whether I'm upside down or right side up. All I know is that this is as close to perfection as fun can get. Maybe the adrenaline has something to do with it, but my heart is fairly bursting with joy. If I was smiling on the Human, I simply can't stop grinning when I climb out of the Cylon train. Had I known the blue-track ride was this amazing, I would have jumped on a long time ago. Battlestar Galactica isn't the only thrill ride at the Universal Singapore, of course. There are also Revenge of the Mummy and the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, the latter now drawing more riders thanks to the release of the blockbuster movie \"Jurassic World\". And, anyway, who can resist the sight of a staff member carrying a \"baby triceratops\" in her arms? I'm allowed to touch it, and the creature blinks realistically. Elsewhere in the Rapid Adventure there's a captive Tyrannosaurus. Yes, these are just robots, but curb your cynicism for a moment and they really are marvels. Rounding out the attractions are Transformers the Ride: The Ultimate 3D Battle and the new Puss in Boots' Giant Journey, which looks set to amaze the kids and the kids-at-heart of all ages. IF YOU GO For Universal Studio Singapore's fifth anniversary there's a \"55 Play 55 Stay\" package. You pay Bt5,555 for two nights in a superior room at the new Genting Hotel Jurong (twin-sharing) with a free round-the-clock shuttle bus, an adult one-day pass, adult admission to the SEA Aquarium any day after 2pm, and a meal voucher worth S$5.
