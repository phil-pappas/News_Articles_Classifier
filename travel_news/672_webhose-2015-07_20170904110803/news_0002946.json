The tour represents the third phase of the YSEALI Generation EARTH Regional Exchange, which began with virtual learning exercises and a four-day workshop this past April in Siem Reap , Cambodia . During the workshop, 72 young leaders from all 10 ASEAN member states worked in teams to develop project ideas addressing a transnational environmental issue.

The three-week tour includes visits to five U.S. cities, beginning in the nation's capital with subsequent stops in New York City ; Burlington, Vermont ; Duluth and Minneapolis, Minnesota ; and Seattle . While stateside, the group will meet with government and educational institutions, app developers, tech startups, community organizations and NGOs to explore environmental management best practices, and learn about resources to implement their project plan and amplify it to reach a greater audience. In each host city, the five participants will take part in various cultural and educational activities, including sharing an evening of home hospitality with an American host family. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T06:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T06:44:59.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
