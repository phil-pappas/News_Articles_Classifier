UPDATED July 30, 2015 Where Debris Could Have Come From Published July 30, 2015 A computer model developed by Erik van Sebille, an oceanographer at the University of New South Wales, uses historical ocean currents data to predict the probable paths that objects could take drifting through the ocean over the course of several months. This map shows the model's predictions for an object washing up on the island of Réunion.

Several countries have searched for the missing plane for more than a year in an area off the coast of Australia. The debris was found across the Indian Ocean, more than 2,500 miles from the search areas.

Possible flight paths, according to a Malaysian government report Search Sources: Malaysian Transport Ministry, Joint Agency Coordination Centre Possible Flight Paths Published May 2, 2014 The Malaysian government released a report describing the confusion and miscommunication in the hours following the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. The report included a map showing several possible flight paths for the missing Malaysia Airlines jet. Their analysis of satellite data produced zones of probability showing where the jet could have crashed.

It has completed surveying approximately two-thirds of the focused underwater search area without detecting anything of interest.

Each of the vehicle’s missions will take one day to complete and will cover an area of about 15 square miles of seabed.

Like most of the ocean, the plateau is poorly mapped. However, the Wallaby Plateau, just to the southeast, has been thoroughly mapped as part of Australia's exclusive economic zone, and, according to David T. Sandwell of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, \"one could assume their sea floor properties will be similar.\" So, Dr. Sandwell said, the two plateaus are probably soft and smooth, making it easier to spot irregular debris in scan data.

The data is currently acquired in two ways: by ships carrying echo sounders (sonar) and by a satellite orbiting the earth that measures ocean surface height variations induced by the gravitational effects of ocean floor topography at a very low resolution. Just 10 to 15 percent of the earth's oceans — and less than 5 percent of the Indian Ocean — have been mapped by echo sounders. The rest of the depth is inferred from the satellite technique.

Smith, NOAA Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry; deepreef.org Signal Detected By Aircraft Unrelated to Black Box Updated April 11, 2014 Australian authorities said April 11 that the potential signal from a sonobuoy — a sensor dropped into the sea by a Royal Australian Air Force plane — was probably not from the flight recorders, despite hopes raised the previous day. The latest potential clue to the whereabouts of the aircraft came in the same seas off Western Australia where the Ocean Shield, an Australian ship, had already collected four sets of signals — two on April 6 and two on April 8 — that could have come from beacons attached to the plane’s two flight recorders. The average depth in that area is about 15,000 feet.
