Furthermore educational programmes in the mass media positively impacted consumers’ purchasing behaviour and consumption of sun care products. The 2014 value increase was considerably higher than the CAGR recorded over the review period due to continuous consumer demand for these products.\nCompetitive Landscape\nTwo international players Beiersdorf and L’Oréal held strong leading positions in sun care in 2014 each with a 36% value share. Both enjoyed brand recognition due to their global reputation and were positioned in mass sun care which accounted for the bulk of sun care sales. A steady increase in brand awareness of the Nivea Sun brand by Beiersdorf and Garnier by L’Oréal was triggered by massive marketing campaigns in Morocco.\nIndustry Prospects\nSun care is expected to enjoy growing and ongoing consumer demand over the forecast period. Increasing awareness of health concerns such as skin damage and skin cancer are expected to trigger higher value sales at constant 2014 prices over the period. Compared with the review period the predicted value growth is expected to be slower when compared in terms of constant 2014 prices. This will lead to increasing price competition resulting in promotional activities and price decreases. As a result sun care is set to register a value CAGR of 10% at constant 2014 prices over the forecast period.\nFull Report Details at\n - \nReport Overview\nDiscover the latest market trends and uncover sources of future market growth for the Sun Care industry in Morocco with research from Euromonitor's team of in-country analysts.\nFind hidden opportunities in the most current research data available understand competitive threats with our detailed market analysis and plan your corporate strategy with our expert qualitative analysis and growth projections.\nIf you're in the Sun Care industry in Morocco our research will save you time and money while empowering you to make informed profitable decisions.\nThe Sun Care in Morocco market research report includes:\n * Analysis of key supply-side and demand trends\n * Detailed segmentation of international and local products\n * Historic volumes and values company and brand market shares\n * Five year forecasts of market trends and market growth \n * Robust and transparent market research methodology conducted in-country\nOur market research reports answer questions such as:\n * What is the market size of Sun Care in Morocco?\n * What are the major brands in Morocco?\n * What is the most common sun protection factor?\n * How are sales of self-tanners performing?\nReasons to Get this Report\n * Gain competitive intelligence about market leaders\n * Track key industry trends opportunities and threats\n * Inform your marketing brand strategy and market development sales and supply functions\nReport Table of Contents:\nSUN CARE IN MOROCCO\nEuromonitor International\nJune 2015\nLIST OF CONTENTS AND TABLES\nHeadlines\nTrends\nCompetitive Landscape\nProspects\nCategory Data\nTable 1 Sales of Sun Care by Category: Value 2009-2014\nTable 2 Sales of Sun Care by Category: % Value Growth 2009-2014\nTable 3 Sales of Sun Care by Premium vs Mass: % Value 2009-2014\nTable 4 NBO Company Shares of Sun Care: % Value 2010-2014\nTable 5 LBN Brand Shares of Sun Care: % Value 2011-2014\nTable 6 LBN Brand Shares of Premium Sun Care: % Value 2011-2014\nTable 7 Forecast Sales of Sun Care by Category: Value 2014-2019\nTable 8 Forecast Sales of Sun Care by Category: % Value Growth 2014-2019\nTable 9 Forecast Sales of Sun Care by Premium vs Mass: % Value 2014-2019\nBiotal Cosmetics Sarl in Beauty and Personal Care (morocco)\nStrategic Direction\nKey Facts\nSummary 1 Biotal Cosmetics SARL: Key Facts\nCompany Background\nProduction\nCompetitive Positioning\nSummary 2 Biotal Cosmetics SARL: Competitive Position 2013\nExecutive Summary\nMoroccans Are More Concerned About Their Appearance\nConsumer Preference Shifts Towards Natural and Organic Products\nSeveral Changes in Distribution Channels\nBuying Behaviour Is Easily Affected by Sales Activities\nHealthy Features Are Preferred Over Functionality\nKey Trends and Developments\nNatural/organic Beauty Products Gain in Popularity\nCustomers Have More Trust in Premium Brands\nDirect Selling Gains Share Over the Review Period\nMarket Data\nTable 10 Sales of Beauty and Personal Care by Category: Value 2009-2014\nTable 11 Sales of Beauty and Personal Care by Category: % Value Growth 2009-2014\nTable 12 Sales of Premium Beauty and Personal Care by Category: Value 2009-2014\nTable 13 Sales of Premium Beauty and Personal Care by Category: % Value Growth 2009-2014\nTable 14 GBO Company Shares of Beauty and Personal Care: % Value 2010-2014\nTable 15 NBO Company Shares of Beauty and Personal Care: % Value 2010-2014\nTable 16 LBN Brand Shares of Beauty and Personal Care: % Value 2011-2014\nTable 17 Penetration of Private Label in Beauty and Personal Care by Category: % Value 2009-2014\nTable 18 Distribution of Beauty and Personal Care by Format: % Value 2009-2014\nTable 19 Distribution of Beauty and Personal Care by Format and Category: % Value 2014\nTable 20 Forecast Sales of Beauty and Personal Care by Category: Value 2014-2019\nTable 21 Forecast Sales of Beauty and Personal Care by Category: % Value Growth 2014-2019\nTable 22 Forecast Sales of Premium Beauty and Personal Care by Category: Value 2014-2019\nTable 23 Forecast Sales of Premium Beauty and Personal Care by Category: % Value Growth 2014-2019\nDefinitions\nSources\nSummary 3 Research Sources\nAbout Fast Market Research\nFast Market Research is a leading distributor of market research and business information.
