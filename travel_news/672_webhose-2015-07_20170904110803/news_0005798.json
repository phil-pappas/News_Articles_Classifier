When planning this trip, I thought I wanted to go to Spiti Valley and spend significant time in Himachal Pradesh. However, now that I'm here (Haridwar, at the moment), I've realized that I actually want to visit Kerala. (I will fly.) I plan to be there from 30 July to 18 August. I have no guidebooks, and my sole internet access is through my phone, which is inconvenient. My question: if I arrive in Cochin with NO PLAN WHATSOEVER, will it be reasonably easy to figure out a mid-range itinerary for three weeks? I want to spend some time in Cochin, do a backwaters cruise, and see tea planation. Please offer feedback on relative stupidity of this plan. Thank you,", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T10:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T15:08:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
