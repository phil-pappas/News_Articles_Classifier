However I have realized taht according to our itinerary, we will reach Delhi by plane from Leh on Thursday at 9:10. We have planned to stay one night od Delhi and go to Agra by some morning train. However I have realized that Taj Mahal is closed on Friday. So we could go directly from the airport to railwaystation and go to Agra by train on Thursday, however I am not sure whether it is make sense because of the possible flight and train delay. Second option is go to Agra on Friday morning according our proposed itinerary and see Agra Fort, Jama Masjid and Taj just from the outside, if it is worth it. Third option is not to go to Agra at all and stay 2 days in Delhi. Our flight to home is leaving Jaipur on Saturday at 20:55 so we have not a much time for itinerary modifications. Thanks for your suggestions!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T00:50:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
