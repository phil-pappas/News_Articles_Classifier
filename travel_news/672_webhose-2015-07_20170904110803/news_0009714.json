Following the fuselage section joining phase, the wings, the horizontal and vertical tailplane as well as tail cone have been joined to the fuselage. Following this, the aircraft will move to the next assembly station for structural completion, ground testing and start of cabin installation.\nThe aircraft is scheduled for delivery early next year and will be the first of 48 A350 XWBs acquired by Cathay Pacific. Cathay Pacific’s A350 XWB fleet will include 22 A350-900s and 26 of the larger A350-1000s, for operation on long- and medium-haul services.\nThe A350 XWB is Airbus’ all-new mid-size long range aircraft and the latest member of the manufacturer’s leading widebody family. It is the world’s most modern and efficient aircraft in its size category and is setting new standards in terms of inflight experience, operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness for airlines.\nThe A350 XWB has been especially successful in the Asia-Pacific region, where 11 major airlines have ordered a total of 244 aircraft out of the 781 total ordered so far. Cathay Pacific represents one fifth of the A350 XWB total orders from Asia-Pacific.\nSource:- Airbus\nRelated Posts Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building BOC Aviation Marks 20th Year With Record Net Profit in 2013 Qatar Executive To Exhibit At Leading Business Aviation Show In Dubai Airlines rated on noise performance – Heathrow Airport China Aircraft Leasing Company firms up order for 100 A320 Family", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T16:08:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
