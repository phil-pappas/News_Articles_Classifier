It might not have the everyday practicality of enrolling on a basic plumbing course or taking Italian lessons. But for sheer romanticism, learning to fence takes some beating. Although not the most high-profile sport, fencing has a thriving scene, with more than 300 clubs across the UK. So if you have been inspired by the recent TV drama The Musketeers, visit the British Fencing website to find your nearest place to cross swords. A simple way into the sport is offered with Go Fence, an initiative that aims to encourage more beginners into fencing with six hours of taster lessons. But instead of using metal swords, you learn the basics with plastic and foam ones. There is certainly a lot to take in if you are new to fencing. Simply choosing your weapon - épée, foil or sabre - can be confusing. Long-established clubs such as the London Fencing Club will guide you in these early stages. A club can also lend you protective clothing, including a mesh face mask. Fencing could turn you into a demon on the dancefloor as nimble footwork is key to the sport Sure, it may take you a while to get the hang of it. But if you do stick with fencing, you will be glad you did. Here are five surprising benefits of the sport: 1. It is a brilliant workout That non-stop backward and forward lunging, as well as the squatting-type pose you take between points, will tone your muscles. Expect to gain powerful thighs and a firm backside. 2. You'll burn serious calories An hour’s bout of fencing will burn off more than 400 calories as you try to outscore your opponent while rushing around the piste, 14m (46ft) long, the marked area where you compete. 3. It will improve your mental agility You'll need to think strategically, planning your next move while anticipating what your opponent will do. 4. You learn some new moves Fencing could turn you into a demon on the dancefloor as nimble footwork is key to the sport. 5. It's good for practising polite manners Like many martial arts, in fencing you learn respect and follow an ancient code of honour. You must show courtesy to your opponent at all times while simultaneously trying to stab them. There is a familiar adage in fencing circles that it would take you two lifetimes to master the sport. Luckily, you don’t need to be a master to get enjoyment - and health benefits - from it.
