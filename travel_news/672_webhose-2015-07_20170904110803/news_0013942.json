Oh, summer holidays,\" animal shelter Dzika Ostoja joked Wednesday in a Facebook post detailing Wandzia the badger's plight in the Baltic seaside resort town of Rewal. \"We found Wandzia drunk, surrounded by seven (empty beer) bottles. There were two more in the bushes, so it's possible Wandzia began partying there. Haha.\" The badger is believed to have stolen the booze from fellow beachgoers, before removing the beer caps with her teeth. The black-and-white omnivore was unconscious for two days straight, shelter head Marzena Bialowolska told AFP, adding that the badger had partially recovered but was still unable to sit up. \"She's been sleeping, drinking (water) and eating chick meat,\" Bialowolska said. If all goes well, Wandzia will be released back into the wild by the end of the week. Photos and a video of the badger recovering can be viewed on the shelter's Facebook page Wandzia is not the first of her kind to have experimented with alcohol. In 2009, German police were called to clear a road of a badger that was \"drunk as a skunk\" from gorging itself on over-ripe, fermented cherries. advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T13:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T15:54:31.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
