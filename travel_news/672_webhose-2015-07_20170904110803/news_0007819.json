Trail of destruction: The world heritage tourist sites wiped... 15 shares A further 20 per cent admitted to doing so at least once a month.\nBut their deceptive claims are relatively harmless, and sometimes, the lies are simply crafted in hopes of boosting their own self-esteem.\nLuxury hotels, restaurants and clubs are the most popular locations to exaggerate on social media\nThe main motivation for doing so is to impress friends, while 29 per cent admit to fibbing in a bid to make themselves feel better.\nBut it seems those friends might be onto the fauxbookers among us, with 35 per cent admitting they have suspected a friend of exaggerating their true location at some point.\nThe biggest giveaway seems to be a lack of picture to accompany a post or the time of day the post is made.\nThe study also found that those aged 18-24 were the biggest social airbrushers, while those over the age of 55 were least likely to embellish their true location.\nAnd it also appears that men more frequently exaggerate.\nThose polled reveal that they often check in to fake places in order to impress friends or boost self-esteem\nPhil Cameron, Founder & CEO of UK based No1 Lounges said: 'We've been amazed by the fauxbooking phenomenon but it's no surprise to see people wanting a slice of the jet set lifestyle.\nThe study revealed that almost half believed access to a VIP airport lounge would cost in excess of £50 when in reality it's more like £25.\n'Fortunately we've made it possible for everyone to use these facilities, regardless of their airline or class of travel, making pre-flight luxury with a big price tag a thing of the past.'", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1CWMBzf"], "published": "2015-07-23T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T01:49:36.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
