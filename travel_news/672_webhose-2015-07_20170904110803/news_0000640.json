Highlights include A One-Stop MICE Wonderland: Multi-destination Programmes in ASEAN , a panel discussion on how multi-destination programmes can be put together in the region; Learning from Success: Case Studies , which will see industry players sharing mini case studies on their events in relatively “fresh” ASEAN destinations; and Discovering ASEAN: A Rising Star for International Exhibitions , which looks at the region’s current exhibition performance and its future. \n\nThe organisers are targeting a turnout of 50 to 100 delegates, of which a majority will be buyers, exhibitors and the media. \n\nThe ASEAN MICE Forum is open for free to all IT&CMA delegates.
