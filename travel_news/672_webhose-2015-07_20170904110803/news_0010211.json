Jazz Jennings, a transgender teen and LGBTQ activist from Broward County, was recently confirmed as one of the keynote speakers for the conference taking place at the 500-room Bonaventure Resort & Spa from Sept. 30 to Oct. 4. Organizers estimate the event will attract close to 1,000 people to its 25th annual celebration. Jennings, 14, is the star of the reality show I am Jazz , which premiered on TLC Wednesday. She has been raising awareness about transgender issues since she was 6, which is the subject of her book which has the same name as her show. She will also hold a book signing at the conference, said Stefanie Schumacher , who's on the board of directors for Southern Comfort. \"I am a huge fan of this young woman, she has done so much in her life,\" said Schumacher, who personally invited Jennings to the event. Additionally, Zackary Drucker, the associate producer of the recently Emmy-nominated Amazon.com TV series Transparent , is also expected to attend. The series chronicles the coming out process of a transgender woman named Maura, played by Jeffrey Tambor , who transitions later in life. Transgender actress Laverne Cox , of Netflix's popular prison drama \"Orange is the New Black,\" may also make an appearance, Schumacher added. But her attendance has not been confirmed by the conference. Caitlyn Jenner , currently one of the most high-profile transgender women, likely won't attend as she is in high demand, Schumacher said. Formerly known as Bruce, Jenner is a retired athlete best known for winning the men's decathlon at the Summer Olympics in 1976 and the E! reality show Keeping Up with the Kardashians . He came out as a transgender woman this year. Formerly held in Atlanta, the Southern Comfort Conference provides access to more than 100 authors, entertainers, leaders and doctors from the national transgender community. A 2011 study by UCLA estimated there are 700,000 transgender people in the U.S. The conference is collaborating with the Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention & Visitors Bureau, which is focused on attracting more transgender travelers to the region, in addition to its efforts to draw more gay, lesbian and bisexual tourists to South Florida. Registration opened for the Southern Comfort Conference in January at SouthernComfortConference.org. \nWant South Florida Travel news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
