Guests can enjoy a drinks reception before they make their way down the grand circular staircase and arrive in true Hollywood style. The venue will be tastefully decorated Hollywood style and each table will be beautifully set with festive decoration, Hollywood memorabilia and crackers. There will be Hollywood classics playing on screen and after dinner there will also be a great DJ that is sure to get the party started.

With free range and corn-fed turkeys from farms in Norfolk , fish from British shores and most of the vegetables from two suppliers based in Kent: one of whom is a unique farm co-operative working with a number of specialist farmers from across the Market Garden of England. ￼ All surplus profits from events at the venue will go to charity.
