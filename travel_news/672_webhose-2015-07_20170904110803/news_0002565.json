Don't expect to buy any Confederate merchandise at the Ohio State Fair this year . WOSU reports the event's organizers have banned the sale of the controversial flag , noting \"a lot of sensitivity\" around the symbol of the old South in recent weeks. \"It's long been a policy of ours that we will prohibit the sale of any merchandise that has offensive lettering, offensive graphics, logos, that type of thing, and so with this year's fair we're really impacting a new prohibition that would prohibit the sale or display of the Confederate flag or Confederate flag merchandise,\" the fair said in a statement. Columbus is buying a lot of bricks for German Village . The city is closing Mohawk Street in phases over the next couple months to repair and replace the neighborhood's iconic brick streets .

The banana company was acquired for $1.3 billion by private equity firms Cutrale Group and Safra Group in January. Cincinnati hit a home run hosting the Major League Baseball All-Star Game . The Cincinnati Business Courier reports the event had a $70 million economic impact on the city , which hosted hundreds of thousands of visitors during the three-day festivities. It was also the highest-rated All-Star Game and Home Run Derby since 2010. And visitors opened up their wallets, buying up more merchandise than any All-Star Game since the 2008 contest during the final year of the old Yankee Stadium. Here in Ohio, we're getting ready for another onslaught of political ads targeting voters in the battleground state. In Denver, viewers are about to see the first pot ad targeting consumers in the legal marijuana state . The Daily Beast reports Denver ABC affiliate KMGH will air an ad for vape pen maker Neos before Jimmy Kimmel Live , a time slot meant to keep in compliance with Colorado's strict rules on advertising pot. \"The world is changing, evolving, and we need to constantly take a look at things,\" KMGH's GM told the site. \"After careful deliberations, we have elected to accept ads from what is now a legal business in Colorado and apply some of the same restrictions and standards that we do for similar adult products, like hard liquor.\" \nWant Columbus Travel news in your inbox?
