The fire incident destroyed the dream of the La Digue couple but they confirmed that they want to rebuild their small hotel. \"I encourage you both to rebuild and assure you both that the Ministry of Tourism and Culture will stand by you and try to facilitate you in the rebuilding of your property\" said Minister St.Ange as he assured that he will encourage every Government Department to facilitate the rebuilding that will be based on the same building plans they had used to construct the property in the first place. \nMarlette said that she was already fully biked for the coming 15th August feast of La Digue and was now trying to relocate guests holding reservations at the Villa Hortensia small hotel on La Digue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T09:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T11:08:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
