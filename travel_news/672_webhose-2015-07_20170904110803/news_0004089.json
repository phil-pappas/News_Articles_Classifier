Business wins included those from the technology and not-for-profit sectors. The continued popularity of event spaces such as the Conservatory and the Concert Hall have seen the Barbican cement its position as Europe’s leading combined arts and conference venue. Recent success at The Meetings Show has also boosted enquiries for the Barbican. \n“Enquiries and confirmation of contracts are coming in every day,” says Jackie Boughton, Head of Sales at Barbican Business Events. “The team has worked hard developing leads and we have noticed a really sharp increase in business. We are very excited about the future following what has been a very successful time for us.” Unlike many other venues, the Barbican was specifically built with the dual purpose of holding conferences and arts events, presenting a diverse range of art, music, theatre, dance, film and creative learning under one roof. Recent high profile events include Wikimania in 2014 and The Spectator debate held at Milton Court. Jackie continues: “Our profile both domestically and internationally is continuing to grow and the confirmed contracts are just one result of our increased visibility. Enquiries are coming in thick and fast so we fully expect to get stronger and stronger as 2015 progresses.” With the Barbican set to announce its ‘package of packages’, organisers are urged to book events with space now limited particularly in August and September.
