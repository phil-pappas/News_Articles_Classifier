Hotels - Airlines - CVBs - Destinations - people Jetstar: Ash experts determined it is safe to resume Bali flights Adv: \nJul 04, 2015 Adv: \nMELBOURNE, Australia - Budget Australian airline Jetstar says it will resume flights in and out of Bali on Friday which were suspended because of a volcanic eruption. \nMt Raung erupted this week, with ash drifting from East Java to Bali potentially obscuring visibility at Denpasar international airport. \nJetstar said in a statement that ash experts had determined it was now safe to resume flights. \nThe Indonesian island of Bali is a top holiday destination for Australians. \nReturn flights to and from Cairns, Perth, Melbourne and Sydney and one-way flights to and from Singapore, Adelaide and Sydney were effected by the suspensions. \n\"Our team will work hard throughout the day to get our passengers moving to their destination as quickly as possible, and we [will] fly an additional Boeing 787 return service between Bali and Australia to help do this,\" the budget airline said. \n\"We regret the impact these cancellations have had on our passengers, particularly during the busy school holiday period, but we will always put safety before schedule,\" it added. \n'Thin emissions' \nVirgin Australia also flies to Bali but a spokesman said its flights were operating on schedule. \n\"Safety is always our highest priority and we are closely monitoring the situation to ensure our flights are unaffected by any ash emanating from Mt Raung,\" the Virgin spokesman said. \nAn Australian Bureau of Meteorology spokesman Jackson Browne told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) the Mt Raung eruption was unlikely to cause a major ash cloud. \n\"In fact the ash emissions were so thin that they weren't able to be identified by satellite imagery,\" he told the ABC. \nMr Browne said other eruptions have produced cubic kilometres of ash and that the Mt Raung eruption was \"magnitudes apart\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T05:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T07:14:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
