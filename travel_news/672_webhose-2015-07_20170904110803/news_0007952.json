Startlingly, according to a Cheapflights.com's sixth annual Airport Affordability Index released late yesterday, Chicago's O'Hare International Airport is now the nation's fifth most affordable airport to fly from with an average airfare of $251. O'Hare skyrocketed from 65th place last year on the list of 101 airports nationwide to its fifth-place position this year. But the Index's even more surprising revelation this year is that Chicago's Midway Airport , which is dominated by low-fare behemoth Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV), plunged to 36th place in the 2015 Index from sixth place last year. Cheapflights says the average airfare out of Midway is now $346, nearly $100 more than it is at O'Hare. On the surface at least, the data suggests that carriers operating out of O'Hare, include behemoths United Airlines (NYSE: UAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) and several smaller discount carriers such as Spirit and Frontier, are starting to aggressively compete on price. And consumers may be the beneficiaries. But Southwest, which practically has Midway to itself now, may be using its hugely-dominant position at the airport to quietly raise prices on flights from the airport even as the airline continues to tout itself as a low-fare leader. Certainly, Southwest's record second-quarter earnings reported yesterday clearly indicate the carrier is generating plenty of revenue, with profits to match. For those travelers who like to compare airfares, at the very least Cheapflight's new Affordability Index results suggest it may pay more than ever to check fares on Southwest against competitors operating out of O'Hare before booking. But the news about Chicago's two airports is only part of several surprises in the Index that indicate the ranking of airports offering the lowest fares can change dramatically in just a year's time. The two most affordable airports on Cheapflight's new list, No. 1 Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport and No. 2 Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, were No. 77 and No. 73 respectively on last year's list. To create its index, Cheapflights.com looks at average airfares travelers found on its site during the month of June to a mix of domestic and international destinations. That data is used to rank the 101 airports on the list. \nWant Chicago Media & Marketing   Industries", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T20:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T21:08:59.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
