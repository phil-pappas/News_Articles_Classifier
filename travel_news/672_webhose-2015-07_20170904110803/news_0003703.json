Source: NewsComAu \nTHIS is not a dusting of icing sugar. It’s the full pavlova. \nSnow has fallen in Queensland, and not just the speck or two we saw earlier this week, but actual snow which you can turn into snowmen or throw at your best friend or put in a cup and take inside to make a lemon cordial slushy, if that’s what takes your fancy. \nHere’s a picture from a backyard in Stanthorpe today. The town just north of the NSW border is 800 metres above sea level, which is just high enough to cop snow which has been falling across most of NSW (and beyond) above about 700 metres overnight. Christmas tree, check. Snow, check. Now all we need is Santa. Pic by Joyce Fletcher. Source: Supplied \nAnd here’s another. The minibus has turned blue with cold. Pic by Joyce Fletcher.

Snow shuts down major NSW highways, turns Queensland town into winter wonderland: http://t.co/3WTNXnVoUC #9News pic.twitter.com/6qtXbcu0nL — Nine News Australia (@9NewsAUS) July 16, 2015 \nHeavy snow has also closed numerous major roads in New South Wales in both directions overnight, leaving countless motorists stranded and deeply frustrated this morning. Train services could also be affected. Passengers on the Blue Mountains line urged to allow extra travel time today due to heavy snow. @TrainLinkWest #9News pic.twitter.com/Uao8pRXJNX — Nine News Sydney (@9NewsSyd) July 16, 2015 \n• The Hume Highway, the main artery between Sydney and Melbourne, is closed in both directions at Berrima due to snow and ice. Berrima is about an-hour-and-a-half west of Sydney. \n• The Great Western Highway is closed between Mount Victoria and Wentworth Falls. It’s the main road over the Blue Mountains, also west of Sydney. \n• The Mitchell Highway is closed between Orange and Bathurst for the second time this week. \n• The New England Highway in the state’s north is also closed between Glen Innes and Armidale. It’s one of two major routes between Sydney and Brisbane. \n• The Bells Line of Road is closed between Bell and Mount Tomah. It’s the other major road through the Blue Mountains. We’ll keep changing this image throughout the morning.

Here's my wife's shot of our yard in Blackheath at about 5am, its even thicker now. pic.twitter.com/XQzIEJoyy4 — Blackheath Weather (@BlackheathWx) July 16, 2015 \nSnow lovers Darren White and his mate Brad Nixon left the Penrith area at 4am this morning. Their plan was to make first tracks at Perisher in the fresh snow. Unfortunately, the only snowy tracks they’re leaving are on the highway. \n“We’ve been stuck for about an hour around Bowral,” the aptly named Mr White tells news.com.au . \n“I got out of the car before before and my foot was entirely engulfed by snow so I’d say there’s about 10cm on the ground. We’re totally stopped. We’ve travelled the length of two semi trailers in the last hour.” An hour out of sydney and we are snowed in on the Hume Highway #snow #nowherenearperisher … https://t.co/NnLacnmbow — Darren White (@dazzawhitey) July 16, 2015 \nAnother man suffering the same frustrations is Alex “Chumpy” Pullin, the dual snowboard cross world champion who carried Australia’s flag in the opening ceremony of last year’s Sochi Winter Olympics. Heading down to the snow and its a white hume hwy near Berrima. #winterdownunder pic.twitter.com/T1hBAjbCPj — Alex Chumpy Pullin (@chumpypullin) July 16, 2015 \nWe gave Chumpy a bell and he, too, confirmed he was going nowhere for now. \n“I’m just off the highway near Bowral and we’re dead stopped. The trees are all covered with snow, which I’ve never seen on the highway before. I’m more used to seeing this sort of thing on the autobahn.” \n“I’ve got a few things lined up for today and I’m going to be late which is not really my style, but I couldn’t be more happy to see this much snow in Oz at the moment.” The blob. Be afraid. Source: NewsComAu \nThe snowfalls are now well north of the Australian Alps, whose ski resorts are basking in fresh snow and sunshine. Hopefully all those keen skiers and snowboarders get through sooner rather than later. Thredbo posted this image on Facebook this morning. Because they love showing off.

We’ll keep you posted on the wild weather and on road closures (and hopefully openings) on this story throughout the morning. The scene at Wallangarra in Queensland this morning.

Could it all be down to a phenomenon called the jet stream? Could it be blamed for everything from Hurricane Sandy to the recent freezing winters?
