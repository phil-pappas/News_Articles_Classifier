Similarly, JPMorgan's trading revenue gained 7% due to bond and stock market activity. Overall, JPMorgan's sale s climbed 4% to $24.8 billion in the three months through March, while Goldman Sachs revenue gained 14% to $10.6 billion. \nThe gains were particularly impressive because trading revenues have been down for the big banks since 2010, when Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, which included a ban on short-term proprietary trading. Prior to the Volcker rule, named for former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, banks were allowed to engage in speculative trading using their own money. Critics of proprietary trading said that led banks to make riskier trades that put the firms at risk. While Dodd-Frank still allows trading on behalf of customers as well as market-making and underwriting, many banks dialed back or even eliminated trading activity. \n\"Trading performance was quite good in the first quarter,\" said Kurt Wilhelm, Director of the OCC's Financial Markets Group. \"We expected strong results, due to the well-established seasonal effect in trading activity. But results were even stronger due to dislocations in currency markets at the beginning of the year, which created uncertainty and spurred client demand for risk-management products.\" \nDespite continued global financial turmoil, including in Greece and China -- which would seem to bode well for trading activity -- analysts expect trading was flat, or perhaps even down in the second quarter. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T18:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T18:51:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
