Besides having one of the most stunning harbours in the world, Sydney is the city I've lived in for the longest period of time (I lived there while I was at school and Uni for four years then tried Melbourne for a year before moving back to Sydney). \nLiving on the Sunshine Coast definitely has its merits but when I yearn for the bright city lights, Sydney is the city that calls to me. \nWhenever I visit, a glimpse of the Opera House and Sydney Harbour never fails to lift my spirits. \nSince I lived there things have changed so much. I'm amazed at the raft of cool bars that have popped up in Sydney's alleyways. The last time I went on a bar crawl I felt more like I was in Melbourne than Sydney. \nAnother aspect of Sydney that I love is wandering around the CBD, Pitt Street (I'm amazed at how much the shops of changed over the years) and the Queen Victoria Building. The QVB is a classic Sydney spot to wander aimlessly around during the day. \nAnyway, I'll stop rambling. If you're planning a trip down south here are some of the best things to do in Sydney .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T04:17:12.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
