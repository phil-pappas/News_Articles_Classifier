Photo courtesy of Boeing In part one of this series, we took a look Seattle-based Boeing’s fleet from the 707 to the 747 . In part two of this series, we look at the 757, the 767, the 777 and the 787. Click here to see my post on competitor Airbus .\nThe twin-engine 757 and the widebody 767 were developed concurrently, so both shared the same technological advances including computerized flight decks, allowing pilots to easily qualify to fly both.\nThe first 757 rolled out of the Renton, Wash., factory on January 13, 1982, with the first flight on February 19, 1982. The aircraft had received 136 orders from seven carriers -- Air Florida, American Airlines, British Airways, Delta Air Lines, Eastern Air Lines, Monarch Airlines, and Transbrasil.\nThe first delivery to launch customer Eastern Air Lines occurred on December 22, 1982. On Nov. 28, 2005, Boeing ended the 23-year run of the 757 by delivering the final jet to Shanghai Airlines. The airplane was the 1,050th Boeing 757.\nThe first 767 was rolled out on August 4, 1981, and had 173 firm orders from customers including Air Canada, All Nippon Airways, Britannia Airways, Transbrasil, and TWA. On September 26, 1981, the prototype took its maiden flight. The first delivery occurred on August 19, 1982, to United Airlines. The 767 family includes five passenger models — the 767-200, 767-200ER, 767-300, 767-300ER and the 767-400ER.\nThe twin-engine long-range 777 was the first entirely new Boeing airplane in more than a decade.\nIt was also the first jetliner to be 100 percent digitally designed using three-dimensional computer graphics.\nThe program was launched in October 1990 with an order from United Airlines. For the first time, eight major airlines – All Nippon Airways, American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Delta Air Lines, Japan Airlines, Qantas, and United Airlines – helped develop the jet. On October 14, 1990, United became the 777 launch customer, with an order of 34 of the type. The first flight took place on June 12, 1994, with the first 777 to United Airlines on May 15, 1995.\nBy 2014, the 777 was available in six models: the 777-200, 777-200ER (Extended Range), a larger 777-300, two longer range models, the 777-300ER, which rolled out Nov. 14, 2002; and 777-200LR Worldliner (the world’s longest range commercial airplane) and the Boeing 777 Freighter. The 777X is Boeing’s newest family of twin-aisle airplanes.\nOn Jan. 29, 2003, Boeing gave a development designation to name to a new super-efficient, mid-sized airplane — the Boeing 7E7 — and released the first image of the airplane concept. The aircraft, named the 787 Dreamliner , was developed with an international industry team as a 200- to 250-seat airplane.\nOn April 26, 2004, Japanese airline All Nippon Airways became the launch customer for the Dreamliner, with a firm order for 50 aircraft with deliveries to begin in late 2008. In May 2007 final assembly on the first 787 began at Boeing's Everett, Washington plant. After seven delays, the first flight took place on December 15, 2009.\nAs much as 50 percent of the primary structure on the 787, including the fuselage and wing, is made of composite materials. General Electric and Rolls-Royce provide engines for the 787. The 787 program opened its final assembly plant in Everett in May 2007. On Oct. 28, 2009, Boeing announced the facility will be the location for a second final assembly site for the 787 Dreamliner, breaking ground less than a month later.\nThe 787 made its first appearance at an international air show at the Farnborough Airshow, United Kingdom, on July 18, 2010. The first 787 was officially delivered to All Nippon Airways on September 25, 2011.\nOn January 16, 2013, both major Japanese airlines ANA and JAL voluntarily grounded their fleets of 787s after multiple incidents involving different 787s, including emergency landings. At the time, these two carriers operated 24 of the 50 Dreamliners delivered. The grounding is reported to have cost ANA some 9 billion yen (US$93 million) in lost sales.\nOn January 16, 2013, the FAA issued an emergency airworthiness directive ordering all U.S.-based airlines to ground their Boeing 787s until yet-to-be-determined modifications were made to the electrical system to reduce the risk of the battery overheating or catching fire.\nFollowing the FAA approval in the U.S., Japan gave permission for passenger airlines to resume Boeing 787 flights in the country effective April 26, 2013. On April 27, 2013, Ethiopian Airlines took a 787 on the model's first commercial flight after battery system modifications.\nOn Nov. 17, 2013, the jet received its 1,000th customer order when Etihad Airways announced an order for 30 787-10 Dreamliners. The Dreamliner family had reached this sales milestone faster than any other widebody airplane in aviation history, and eight years faster than the popular 777.\nAs of July 2015, the aircraft has a total of 1,095 orders, with 292 deliveries.
