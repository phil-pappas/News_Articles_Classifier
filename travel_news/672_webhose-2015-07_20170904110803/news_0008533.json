The permanent display entitled \"The `Beautiful Game' Turns Ugly\" will open at the National Museum of Organized Crime and Law Enforcement in downtown Las Vegas on September 1. It will feature photos, media clippings and narratives about alleged bribes and other criminal activity in the Federation Internationale de Football Association. A U.S. indictment citing the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, a federal law known as RICO, was filed against senior FIFA officials in May. The museum's executive director on Tuesday said in a statement that the new feature on the world's most popular sport would be of interest to Vegas' many foreign visitors. The non-profit museum opened in 2012.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T21:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T04:09:04.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
