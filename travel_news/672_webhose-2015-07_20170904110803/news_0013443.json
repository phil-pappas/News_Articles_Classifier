Now She's Speaking Out. The Huffington Post Canada | By Jesse Ferreras reddit \nChristine Flynn was ready to fly home to Toronto from a weekend in New York when another passenger requested that she change seats on Monday. \nThe executive chef with Toronto's iQ Food Co. was settled into a Porter Airlines flight when a man dressed in Orthodox Jewish clothes came up the aisle, turned to another man and said, \" change ,\" The Toronto Star reported. \nThe man apparently refused to sit next to the woman for religious reasons. And the situation now has her asking for an apology from the airline. \nFlynn was initially confused by the request. But she soon discerned that the man didn't want to sit beside a woman. \n\"He came down the aisle, he didn't actually look at me ... or make eye contact,\" she told CBC News. \nFlynn told the Star that she would have moved if the man had addressed her directly and explained why they couldn't sit together. \n\"But to not be included in the conversation, to take away my words and my right to choose ... this is the 21st century,\" she told the newspaper. \nPorter said that Flynn declined when a flight attendant asked if she would take another seat. The Orthodox man was eventually seated next to another male passenger. \nBut Flynn still wants an apology. \n\"He could have made a plan, he could have put in a request,\" she told CBC News of the Orthodox man. \n\"Leaving it to the last minute and expecting me to move is appalling.\" \nPorter Airlines spokesman Brad Cicero told The National Post that while this isn't the first time such an instance has come up, it doesn't happen often . \nHe said the company is looking at making a formal policy for such encounters. \n\"This was not a situation where she was forced to move; we always want to accommodate all of our passengers,\" he said. \"But we are looking into formalizing the informal ways in which we've handled this in the past.\" \nWhile they may not be common occurrences on Porter flights, such situations are coming up more often than they used to, with more and more airline passengers are relating instances of ultra-Orthodox men refusing to sit next to women, The New York Times reported. \nThere are Jewish religious laws that prohibit women and men from touching if they're not married, said Rabbi Avi Shafran, a spokesman for ultra-Orthodox organization Agudath Israel of America, told the paper. But he added that many ultra-Orthodox men are fine with sitting next to women while travelling, so long as they're not trying to derive any sexual stimulation from accidental touching. \n\"The [ultra-Orthodox] men I know ... have no objection to sitting next to a woman on any flight,\" Shafran said. \nSeat changes on airlines aren't confined to Orthodox Jews. \nThe Post noted that flights leaving Saudi Arabia often see changes to seating arrangements to accommodate both women and men who don't wish to sit together. \nAs for Flynn, she is happy that Porter is looking at changing its practice around such conflicts. Religious Women Breaking Down Barriers of   Reverend Libby Lane was consecrated as the Bishop of Stockport, and the Church of England's first female bishop, in January 2015. \"I am very conscious of all those who have gone before me, women and men, who for decades have looked forward to this moment,\" Lane said at a December press conference. \"But most of all I am thankful to God.\" Despite being excommunicated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Mormon activist Kate Kelly tirelessly continues working on the movement to ordain women in the Mormon church. Speaking after she lost her final appeal to rejoin the church in February, Kelly said: \"I am proud of what I have done. I am proud of the women and men who have taken a stand with me in this struggle for gender justice. We will continue to act with integrity and courage. Mormon women and their legitimate concerns cannot be swept under the rug or summarily dismissed by one 'Court of Love.'\" L.A.-based professionals M. Hasna Maznavi and Sana Muttalib became co-presidents of what may be the first Women's Mosque in the United States in January, providing a space where women can come together to pray, learn and deepen their faith. Pastor Renita Lamkin, Rabbi Susan Talve, Rev. Jennifer Bailey and many other women of faith offered countless hours and resources to the #BlackLivesMatter movement, working to promote equality, justice and an end to police brutality.

In January 2014, Angela Warnick Buchdahl was elected head rabbi of New York's historic Central Synagogue, becoming one of only a few women -- and likely the only Asian-American -- to lead a major U.S. synagogue. Many describe Buchdahl as a \"pioneer.\" Linda Sarsour, director of the Arab American Association of New York, co-founded the hashtag and accompanying resource website #TakeOnHate in 2014 to challenge growing misconceptions of Arab and Muslim Americans. Championing the power of social media activism, Sarsour told Religion News Service: \"Hashtags are temporary, but knowledge is not temporary… Once you learn something, you won’t forget you had that experience, that conversation. And you don’t have to wait for national TV to call to get your message out.\" Seventeen-year-old Malala Yousafzai won a Nobel Peace Prize in December, alongside children's rights activist Kailash Satyarthi. Since being shot by the Taliban in 2012, Yousafzai has become a world-renowned peace activist and champion of children's rights. Sister Cristina Scuccia won \"The Voice of Italy\" on June 6, 2014 with breathtaking renditions of popular songs like Alicia Keys' \"No One\" and Cyndi Lauper's \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.\" Scuccia subsequently released her first album in November and performed at a Vatican holiday concert. It turns out that even nuns want to have a little fun now and then! In June 2014, Rev. Amy Butler became the senior minister and first woman to hold the job at the historic Riverside Church in New York City.
