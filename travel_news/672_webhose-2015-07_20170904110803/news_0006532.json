Victoria’s Ashcombe Maze and Lavendar Garden and the Tangled Maze at Springmount, Victoria were ranked fifth and eighth respectively on a list of the world’s top ten mazes compiled by design website DesignCurial. The Ashcombe’s organic evergreen design and the Tangled Maze’s thorny rose puzzle had judges in raptures, ranking them ahead of the Andrassy Castle Maze in Hungary, and Vienna’s Schonbrunn Palace maze. Topping the list was Hawaii’s Dole Plantation featuring a large pineapple maze, followed by Richardson Adventure Farm in Illinois, which changes its design each year. Third place went to the 300-year-old Villa Pisani Labyrinth in Stra, Italy, which is famed for Napoleon once getting lost there. The UK was the most represented country featuring three times on the list, with the Peace Maze in Northern Ireland, Penpont Maze in Wales and Hampton Court Palace Maze in England. “The goal was to identify some of the most beautiful and iconic mazes in the world while uncovering some of the more exotic and unexplored labyrinths,” said DesignCurial web editor Katherine Houston.\nThe best cure for jet lag is down time to recover. Picture: Thinkstock Source: Supplied\nBEATING JET LAG\nJET lag is not all in the mind, with new research revealing the physical toll switching time zones can take on the body. The study undertaken by 1Above flight drink found even a relatively short trans-Tasman flight can disrupt the body’s circadian rhythms for a day, and the more time zones crossed, the longer it will take to feel human again. The general rule is one day of recovery for each time zone crossed, meaning those flying to the UK or Europe should factor in a recovery time of three days. 1Above CEO Stephen Smith said the research highlighted the need for business travellers in particular, to be given sufficient time after flying to get back to their best. “Flying takes a toll on the body which in turn can affect how well people perform when they arrive and need to go straight into back to back meetings,” said Smith. He said the best advice for minimising jet lag was to remain well-hydrated during flights, and factor in some light exercise wherever possible. “Always book the aisle seat if possible, because studies have found people in the window or dreaded middle seat, tend to move around the least out of fear of disrupting other passengers,” Smith said.\nThe peaks will be the scene of a new Whisky Trek devised by Santis Malt Whisky and Switzerland Tourism. Source: Supplied\nHAPPY HIKING\nTRAVEL insurers will love this adventure. Switzerland has launched its very first Whisky Trek, combining cloud-scraping heights with alcohol. Based in the beautiful canton of Appenzell, just a 90-minute train ride from Zurich, the trek explores the history of whisky production in the region. Although Switzerland is not traditionally known for whisky, the Santis Malt Whisky made in Appenzell has won many international awards due to the special barrels in which it is produced. Director of Swiss tourism Mark Wettstein told Check-Out the unique story coupled with unbeatable alpine scenery was an “extraordinary experience for any visitor”. “This trek not only highlights a very well-preserved and traditional side of Switzerland but also shows off the country’s rugged and untouched nature,” Wettstein said. Trekkers have the opportunity to taste whiskies slumbering for months in the cellars of 27 mountain inns, surrounding the famous summits of Hoher Kasten, Ebenalp, Kronberg and Santis. www.saentismalt.com\nThe Mt Buller Sled Dog Race, held on July 28 and 29. Source: Supplied\nCOOL RUNNINGS\nA NOVEL new attraction hits Mt Buller in the Victorian snowfields this week. Held over two action-packed days, the Mt Buller Sled Dog Quest will see up to 30 teams from across Australia compete over two challenging courses. Starting at twilight on Tuesday July 28, teams of two and four dogs will head off from the Village, up the Bourke Street ski run and around a course that skirts the ski fields. Teams of six and eight dogs will tackle a longer course the following evening, heading towards Mt Stirling. The races are tipped to add to the experience of skiing Mt Buller, and introduce guests to the Sled Dogs which also host tours of the resort. All going well, the event could become a fixture on the Australian snow season calendar and attract international competitors.\nThe movie inspiration behind The Marigold Suite at the Intercontinental Melbourne The Rialto. Source: Supplied\nSTAR QUALITY\nMOVIES have served as the inspiration for many holidays. Just think of what Lord of the Rings did for Wellington in New Zealand, and what almost every Woody Allen film has done for New York. Now Intercontinental Melbourne is trying to tap into the enthusiasm for The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel by transforming one of its rooms at The Rialto, into a scene from the much loved film. Melbourne stylist Kali Cavanagh mined her own memories of India as well as inspiration from the movie to create “The Marigold Suite”. Available for the next five weeks at a cost of $360 a night, the spacious room features amazing attention to detail, from the thoughtfully-placed copper urns and trinkets, to pots of burnt orange marigolds. All guests who stay in the suite will score a copy of the movie on DVD, and go into the draw to win a precious piece of Indian design for their own home. www.melbourne.intercontinental.com\nVanuatu’s Breakas Beach Resort in Port Vila is among those back up and running after Cyclone Pam. Picture: Breakas Beach Resort\nVANUATU REVIVAL\nIT was only five months ago that Vanuatu was devastated by Cyclone Pam, and the islands’ all important tourism industry left in tatters. After an intense period of rebuilding, the island nation is now back in business with all but five of Flight Centre’s contracted hotels up and running again. To help Vanuatu back on its feet, the travel agency is encouraging Australian travellers who are chasing the sun to reconsider the Pacific Island gem. Head of Flight Centre Australia Tom Walley told Check-Out, key Port Vila resorts such as Breakas, Warwick Le Lagon and Mangoes were all back to normal. “If you were in town you wouldn’t even know a category five cyclone had been through just a few months earlier,” Walley said. “There are still some hotels closed but most will reopen before the end of the year and only two have been closed permanently.” Other attractions, such as Vanuatu’s second most popular island Espiritu Santo, had not even been affected by Cyclone Pam, so the pristine white beaches and great dive sites were all ready and waiting, Walley said. Fares starting at $608 return from Sydney, and from $539 return from Brisbane are now available for travel in coming months.\nParis beyond the Eiffel Tower in Michael Saint James’ coffee table book Bridges of Paris. Picture: AFP/Loic Venance Source: AFP\nBRIDGES OF PARIS\nJUST when you thought the coffee table book had gone the way of, well, coffee tables, comes a new offering from Francophile and photojournalist, Michael Saint James. Bridges of Paris is billed as “Paris beyond the Eiffel Tower”, and features 350 original images of the city and the bridges that lay at its heart. Incredibly 37 bridges cross the Seine River, and Saint James’ book includes portraits of all of them, as well as “intimate riverside moments”. The author spent a full year in Paris getting to know the bridges, the culture and people in order to best capture the essence of the French capital. He says he hopes the book helps people “experience a new culture with an open mind”.", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/21/1227450/997317-8a1cf714-2e88-11e5-a24e-db314d4219bf.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/21/1227450/997222-e206a008-2e72-11e5-a24e-db314d4219bf.jpg", "http://fly1above.com/", "http://www.flightcentre.com.au/", "http://www.bridgesofparis.com/", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/21/1227450/997092-1a1546a2-2e73-11e5-a24e-db314d4219bf.jpg", "http://www.melbourne.intercontinental.com/", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/21/1227450/997694-fd976adc-2e72-11e5-a24e-db314d4219bf.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/21/1227450/996429-99e47d2c-2e86-11e5-a24e-db314d4219bf.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-26T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T15:15:43.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
