The question I have always asked myself is 'How can one carry such weight?' I believe there are some people out there with the same question and more unanswered questions. \nThe trick is simply broken down to whether or not you know how to pack a backpack correctly or not.This will define the convinience or inconvinience you will experience. \nHow to Pack a Backpack Correctly - Steps \nChoose the correct backpack \nIt may seem like a small factor in the whole process but it is essential you have the correct size, right material and the needed capacity to fit your needs and the usage intended. For example if you are going mountain climbing you will want the least load on your back, however, you will have to carry the essential climbing equipment and the heavy warmer clothing thus you will need a bigger backpack. Backpack capacities are measured in liters and this can range anywhere between 25 to 90, the larger the figure the more the capacity. \nWeight distribution \nDespite how heavy the load may seem,where it is placed will determine everything. Items with the most weight need to be placed high between the shoulder blades and as close to your back as possible. This distributes the weight on the hips making the load seem lighter. The lightweight gear like your blanket or sleeping bag should be placed at the bottom while the middle weight load should be placed towards the top and outside portions. For the average user the backpack total weight should not exceed 30% of the total body weight. However the experienced backpackers should be able to carry more weight. \nBackpack organisation \nYou will need to consolidate some items so as to create space for more load.For example if you have food and a pot or a dish then it is advisable to place the food inside so as to save on space.The better organised the items are the easier it will be to access them. \nKeep it tight and tidy \nDon't just throw in the items, you will need to arrange them well.Most importantly, you will have to keep the essentials handy.This will avoid incidences in which you will be forced to remove all the overlying load just to get to the necessities such as food, toiletries, utensils etc. \nExtras \nIf need be or if you enjoy it then you can attach some extra load to the backpack.The load needs to be as light as possible and preferably the most essential or easily damaged items. You may choose to attach the load at your waste facing the front or at the back just below the backpack. \nAlso,it may be necessary to use a trash bag when packing the items. This depends on the nature of your use and will save you a lot in case of water spillage,rain or exposure to liquids. \nThe above guidelines are essential to follow to make thing much more easier for you. Anyone can apply them.To get maximum result don't just try one,follow every step. Try it next time and am sure you will not regret.
