We have not taken this decision lightly but our first priority will always be the safety of our citizens. \n\"In the days and weeks ahead, we will continue to keep the situation under close review and to work with the Tunisians to further understand the threat and to strengthen their security response to it.\" \nIf you are in Tunisia, you should contact your tour operator or airline who can help plan your return. Anyone travelling independently should look to return on commercial flights. \nWe keep our travel advice under constant review.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T03:30:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
