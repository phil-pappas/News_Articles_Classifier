According to the report, the department sent a letter to major U.S. carriers demanding copies of all communications between the airlines, Wall Street analysts and major shareholders about their capacity. The Justice Department did not confirm which airlines were being investigated. Four airlines — American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines ­— still stand after bankruptcies and mergers and now fly more than 80 percent of all domestic passengers. “If not for the radical consolidation we have seen in the airline industry in the last few years, we probably would not even be having this conversation,” said Roger Dow , president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association , in a statement . “Now that four carriers control 85 percent of domestic routes, ‘collusion’ is a thought that’s constantly going to be in the back of the minds of federal regulators.” He said Congress has a remedy to this problem and it should make adjustments to airport financing so individual airports can raise money to expand terminal space. “More competitors significantly lessens the possibility that collusion can occur, and the pressures upon prices and service would be tremendously favorable to travelers, and therefore the broader economy,” Dow said. \nWant Nashville Travel news in your inbox?
