The $289 million Omni Hotel & Resorts project planned for downtown Louisville is being subsidized by $139 million in state and local tax dollars, and its design faces complaints from those who fear the 30-story development could disregard history and kill a major city street in downtown Louisville. The Omni design was subject to a public hearing that lasted for more than four hours Wednesday morning at the Old Jail Auditorium on West Liberty Street. Louisville-Jefferson County Metro Government's Downtown Development Review Overlay Committee heard from city leaders and officials with Dallas-based Omni Hotel & Resorts as well as from people who believe the current design does not address the needs of downtown Louisville. No action was taken this morning, and the public hearing has been continued to 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, July 29. The design and its impact on Third Street Plans call for the Omni to occupy two-thirds of the block bounded by Second, Third and Liberty Streets and Muhammad Ali Boulevard. Most who spoke this morning said they welcome Omni and support the project but feel changes are needed to the design. One of the key concerns raised this morning was the desire by Omni to have loading docks and a six-story parking garage front Third Street. The main entrance for the 600-room hotel, which would also have 225 apartment units, would front on Second Street and have a significant restaurant and retail presence on the first floor. Two full-service restaurants — a three-meal concept and Bob’s Steak & Chop House — are planned, and there would be a coffee shop, more than 70,000 square feet of meeting space, rooftop bar and pool concepts, a speakeasy and other amenities incorporated into the overall design. A 20,000-square-foot urban market is proposed at the corner of Third and Liberty Streets, said Ed Abeyta, a principal with Dallas-based architects HKS Inc. , the lead architect on the project. Apartment access would be centered on Liberty Street, said Mike Garcia , chief financial officer and senior vice president of acquisitions and development for Omni. But, as detractors of the design noted, none of the complex's amenities are reflected at street level on Third Street. Instead, passersby would see only loading dock doors and the unwelcoming site of the garage, which many referred to as a pedestrian traffic killer. Scott Kremer , an architect and member of the DDRO committee, also noted that trucks pulling into the loading docks could significantly delay or stall traffic on Third Street during key moments of the day. Kremer said he would like to see retail options fronting Third Street and the loading dock doors reconfigured, possibly to have trucks load off an alley facing toward Muhammad Ali Boulevard. Marianne Zickuhr , executive director of Preservation Louisville Inc. , an agency that works to preserve the city's culture and history, said the design essentially would turn Third Street into a \"dead zone.\" And local resident Claude Stephens called it a \"canyon\" that would generate no activity for that corridor. Kremer said he supports the project but likely would vote against it if these changes are not made. Garcia said Omni is open to exploring retail along Third Street but did not indicate what that could look like. Jeff Mosley , deputy chief of Louisville Forward , the city's economic development agency, said Omni and the city will pursue two-way traffic on Third Street, likely between Main Street and Broadway, to improve traffic flow. That would require a traffic study and state approval. Another concern raised was the incorporation of more green technology into the design in hopes of reducing the energy and heat produced by the the building. Former Louisville Water Co. building The stretch of Third Street that the Omni would occupy currently is the site of the former Louisville Water Co. building, and some preservationists would like the building to be saved. The Omni parking garage will be owned and managed by the Parking Authority of River City. Some who spoke at the public hearing proposed locating the parking garage underground and incorporating the water company building into the design, but city and Omni officials said that option is not financially feasible for PARC. In particular, Mosley said, incorporating the former water company building into the Third Street design would have have added $6 million to $12 million to to the cost, and PARC could not afford that. The city now is looking to move the former water company building to another site in its entirety or disassemble the facade and other portions of the building and move them into storage for future reuse. The DDRO Committee must give its authorization to move all or part of the former water company building and is considering those proposals as it reviews the Omni design. Several speakers said they would like to see more effort made by Omni to incorporate the water company building into the design, and many said the building would be lost if the building is disassembled because facades removed are rarely reused elsewhere. Zickuhr called on the committee to reject the current design and push for something that would create beauty and energy while also preserving the history of the corridor. No plan for the rest of the block Some members of the committee said they were concerned that Omni has no workable plan for one-third of the block that is not part of the hotel development. Omni will be deeded the entire block by the city, but Garcia said Omni has no immediate plans to develop that space, which is partially occupied by Odd Fellows Hall. Garcia said the site will be used as a staging ground for construction and will likely be developed by Omni at some point, though Mosley said Omni will have the right to sell the undeveloped property if it chooses. Pressed by the committee, Garcia also would not commit to preserving Odd Fellows Hall from demolition. A sale is unlikely, Garcia said, because Omni would want to have control over who occupies the space to ensure it is compatible with the development. Barbara Sexton Smith , former president and CEO of Fund for the Arts Inc., suggested that Omni use the remainder of the block to create a public park or greenspace area. Speakers also pushed for more public art displays, greenspace and pedestrian-friendly features on the exterior of the building. Smith said the current design creates a false sense of inclusion. Referring to metal screening proposed on the parking garage, Smith said: \"Metal screens don't invite me to come in.\" \nWant Louisville Commercial Real Estate news in your inbox?
