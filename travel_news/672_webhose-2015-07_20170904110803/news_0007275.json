Two months ago however, chief executive Peter Fankhauser said although it was “early stages”, bookings had not suffered from a backlash among British customers.

Your or Thomas Cook correspondents should be aware that they were no mas killings in Greece. Furthemore the cash recommendation of whatever authority is out of date since foreign tourists with credit or debit cards issued abroad could in any ATM withdraw cash money all over the Coyntry! The 2006 accident in Corfu remembered now is concerning only Thomas Cook employees! Greek justice has dealt with.! Unsuitable or offensive?
