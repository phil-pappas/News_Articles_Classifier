These apps have improved my passenger travel experience so much that I wonder how I survived all these years without them. Below are five of my picks, along with what makes them so great for travelers.\nAndrew Bret Wallis/Digital Vision/Getty Images 1. GateGuru Free in iTunes , Google Play and the Windows Store . GateGuru is like a travel manager in your hands. The Journey Card section provides all your day-of-travel information in real time, including security wait times, flight delays, gate changes or layover time adjustments. The Airport Card is what launched GateGuru by offering terminal maps, crowd-sourced reviews of food/beverage and retail outlets and weather. And when you have a tight connection and want to make sure you get something to eat for the plane ride, this app is a godsend.\n2. Kayak Pro 99 cents in iTunes and free for the basic version in Google Play . You need a reliable app that helps you check on airline fares (except for Southwest Airlines), and this is it. But the Pro version does so much more. You can check hotel and rental car deals, book hotels, track an manage flights, check bag fees, view information on more than 100 airports (powered by GateGuru ), set up air fare price alerts and follow flight search trends.\n3. Next Flight $2.99 in iTunes and Google Play . This app is perfect to get you out of a flight delay or cancellation, or if you just want to catch an earlier or later flight. Type in your city-pair and travel date, and the app shows all the flights available that day, by airline, both non-stop and connecting. So when you're on the phone trying to get help from the ticket agent, you've already done the heavy lifting, making it far more likely that you'll get on a new flight.\nMyTSA app. Transportation Security Administration 4. MyTSA Free in iTunes and Google Play . I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised that the Transportation Security Administration was able to create an app that uses crowdsourcing to tell how long security lines are at airports and if there are any flight delays. It also allows users to type in an item and check if they can bring it in their carry-on or checked baggage. Finally, it offers a guide that answers travelers' most common security questions.\n5. Hotel Tonight Free in iTunes and Google Play . Many travelers have experienced having their flight delayed or cancelled, and finding themselves stuck. This app offers some great same-day deals at hotels in dozens of cities across the world. And these are not budget-type hotels. Brands appearing on the app include Kimpton, Hampton Inn & Suites, Embassy Suites, Residence Inn and Sheraton.\nShare ", "external_links": ["https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gateguru-featuring-airport/id326862399?mt=8", "https://itunes.apple.com/app/next-flight/id296474127?ign-mpt=uo%3D6&mt=8", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gateguruapp.android", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/c/F/Picture1.jpg", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.touchmeme.android.nextflight", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/L/5/G/142309131_HighRes.jpg", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.dhs.tsa.mytsa", "http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/gateguru/950ac585-594f-499b-b1d7-928caa88585c", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kayak-pro/id338227344?mt=8", "http://www.gateguru.com/", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/5/G/142309131_HighRes.jpg", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hotel-tonight/id407690035?mt=8", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kayak.android&hl=en", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-tsa/id380200364?mt=8", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/L/c/F/Picture1.jpg", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hoteltonight.android.prod"], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T19:33:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
