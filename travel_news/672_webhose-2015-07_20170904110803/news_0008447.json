Airport officials said Monday that a car parked curbside outside a terminal was searched and no threat was found. Authorities say the 26-year-old man somehow got through a Transportation Security Administration checkpoint Sunday night despite not having a ticket. The then man boarded a commercial flight. An airport agent contacted law enforcement after the man boarded. He was arrested on a charge of criminal trespassing. The man's name hasn't been released. The flight was delayed because of the incident. Additional details about the flight weren't released. TSA spokesman Mike England says the agency is reviewing the incident and has added more barriers to screening areas at the airport.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T05:13:18.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
