Beachgoers walk past Hollywood mogul David Geffen's home on Carbon Beach. Source: AP \nIT’S known as “Billionaires’ Beach” lying on one of Malibu’s most exclusive stretch of coastlines, and it’s now open to the public. \nCarbon Beach was off limits to the general beach goers for decades after wealthy homeowners, Lisette and Norman Ackerberg, refused to build a public access path as required by the state. \nThe quarrel dates back to the 1980s when the California Coastal Commission gave the Ackerberg’s permission for building permits on the proviso that they build a public accessway beside their house to the beach. After decades of wrangling it’s finally accessible to the public. Source: Splash News Australia \nHowever the Ackerbergs stalled the path, filing lawsuits and erecting a nine foot wall, placing large boulders in the area and building a tennis court to keep the public from the beach. \nAffluent residents have taken extensive measures over the years to keep beachgoers from their elite stretch of sand that is home to billionaires such as Larry Ellison, former chief executive of Oracle Corp, movie mogul David Geffen and former Dodgers CEO Jamie McCourt. John Travolta and Courteney Cox were also former resident of the billionaires row. It’s a victory!

She was ordered to pay $1.1 million in fines and build and maintain the public path. \n“It’s a small victory in a very large battle,” Graham Hamilton, chairman of the West LA/Malibu chapter of the Surfrider Foundation, told Business Insider . It will open between sunrise and sunset. Source: AP \n“We hope that any development that is going to take place in the future remembers the citizens’ rights under the California Coastal Act and state constitution, which allow public access to coastal lines.” The views aren’t too shabby.
