Carnival Corp. (NYSE:CCL) has gained approval from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the U.S. Department of Commerce to begin offering travel to Cuba, the Miami-based cruise giant announced Tuesday. The company plans to add a Cuba itinerary to its new cruise line, Fathom, which will launch its maiden voyage in April 2016 to the Dominican Republic from PortMiami. Travel to Cuba on Fathom's ship is expected by May 2016. It is authorized under current U.S.-to-Cuba travel guidelines that allow licensed travel companies to transport approved travelers to Cuba to engage in activities that support the island's residents, the company said.
