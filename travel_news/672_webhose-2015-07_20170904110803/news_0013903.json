This is one of the certainties on which life is founded. The sun rises, the earth revolves, the stars twinkle in the night sky, and Ireland’s leading low-cost airline comes up with another inventive way to convince you to fly off to Tallinn for £24.99 (one-way, plus a few little fees and charges). It is, of course, easy to be cynical about a carrier which has long flirted with controversy (even embracing it at times) – and yet has grown to such an extent in its 30-year history that it carried 82 million passengers in 2014. Equally, it is easy to roll the eyes at a man whose enthusiastic belief in the idea that there is no such thing as bad publicity has seen him pitch such concepts as his customers having to pay to visit the toilets on his aircraft. • Ryanair bans duty-free alcohol from Ibiza flight But Mr O’Leary’s latest pronouncement makes for interesting reading. The fresh targets in his sights are flight comparison websites – those digital babies of the last decade, portals such as Skyscanner ( skyscanner.net ) and Cheapflights ( cheapflights.co.uk ), which purport to show you (and help you to book) the least expensive way from Airport A to Destination B, without being affiliated to any of the airlines whose prices they unearth. Inoffensive stuff, you might think – the modern information industry doing its job. And doing its job to the benefit of the likes of Ryanair, to boot. A quick search of Skyscanner for the most affordable route between London and Copenhagen in September has just redirected me to the Ryanair site with the promise of return flights from Luton for £19.98. Michael O'Leary says that flight comparison websites \"shouldn't exist\" (Photo: Getty) But Mr O’Leary is unhappy, declaring in his new broadside that “those kinds of websites shouldn’t exist.” This, he argues, is a card the main carriers should be playing themselves. “I think it is something the big airlines could and should work together on,” he continues, “because it makes no sense for third-party comparison websites [to be part of the process]. If the airlines were competitive and had a competent digital offering, those kinds of websites shouldn’t exist.” The response from the comparison sites has been predictably swift and defensive. “Third-party meta search sites like Cheapflights.co.uk ensure customers have a transparent view across the market and are thoroughly informed when booking travel,” told Travelmole. “Customers put trust in third-party sites because they know they are independent – so to suggest they are unnecessary is surprising,” said Hugo Burge, the CEO of Cheapflights. • Why I miss the bad old days of Ryanair But what is more interesting are Ryanair’s plans for superseding Cheapflights et al. Mr O’Leary has, he says, been in touch with four other (unnamed) airline groups (probably easyJet, Lufthansa, British Airways/Iberia and Air France/KLM), and asked if they would be willing to launch a service that will see them display each other’s prices in a gesture of open competition. Ryanair’s website, he says, will have a comparison facility by autumn. “We are keen that the major airlines offer a price comparison feature on each other’s sites,” he adds. “It’s not that we would take a lot of passengers from [the other airlines] – [more that] we would supply some traffic to them when Ryanair is full.” “When we launch this new facility later in the autumn, we will have a price comparison service available to passengers so that they can come to Ryanair.com, make a booking – and see what’s available on rival airlines as well.” Flight comparison websites have boomed in the last five years Now this sounds lovely. Very even-handed and friendly. Good of this low-cost behemoth to offer a no-strings-attached leg-up to little British Airways and tiny Dutch start-up KLM. Sarcasm aside, though, the obvious question is why any airline – not just Ryanair – would willingly want to subject their prices to bare scrutiny while effectively advertising their rivals. Why would you announce that the cost of your service to Rome on a given day is a full £50 more than that of your opponents – and at a rather earlier and less inviting hour? The answer, in both cases, is that you would not. So why is Ryanair – which, until, March of last year (when it overhauled an archaic website which was as much an exercise in making consumers tick and un-tick boxes for unwanted extras as a way to book a flight), was something of a internet dinosaur – now coming across as a technological innovator? Trying to second-guess a brain as sharp as Michael O’Leary’s is a fool’s errand – but I would suggest there are two reasons why Ryanair may want to dabble in ‘show and tell.’ The first is that – presumably – Michael O’Leary thinks Ryanair will emerge as the ‘best’ option on a regular basis. This is borne out if you perform a search on Skyscanner or Cheapflights, where Ryanair often tops the list, partly because its headline prices do not include the add-ons (allocated seating, checked-in baggage) which later inflate the figure. • VivaCam: Ryanair's low-cost model is heading for Central America The second is that such a head-to-head service would frequently produce Ryanair as the only choice. Such is the scale of the airline’s operations – it flies to over 180 airports in Europe, north Africa and the Middle East – that its presence will always be visible on a comparison website. For example, it is currently the only airline to operate direct flights from the UK to the Slovakian capital Bratislava (from Birmingham, Liverpool, Stansted, Luton and Edinburgh) – a distinction worth trumpeting, even if the airline has, in the past, mischievously marketed the airport as ‘Bratislava Vienna’ (the Austrian capital being just the 41 miles and one country to the west). And it is the only airline to run a year-round service to the south-westerly French city of Biarritz. Search for flights to this pleasing coastal hotspot and surf-friendly destination during October half-term, and a comparison website will tell you that easyJet’s connection from Gatwick finishes in mid-September.

Obviously, all this is moot. The prospect of BA or easyJet offering their data and prices to their main competitors is a dream of the fluffiest and most cloud-dwelling type. And even if Europe’s major airlines do decide to dive into some new epoch of share-and-share-alike, it is unlikely to be at the behest of Ryanair’s oh-so-clever public face. Still, no harm in asking. Skyscanner, Cheapflights and their users can rest easy for the foreseeable future.
