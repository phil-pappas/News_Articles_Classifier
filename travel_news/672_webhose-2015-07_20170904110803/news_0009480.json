It will also create thousands of jobs, making it a vital part of our long-term economic plan.\n“Today’s announcement isn’t just about new technology, it’s a key way to improve customer journeys, by increasing reliability and making sure they have the right information at the right time. We have seen huge growth in the number of people travelling by train and this investment will play a key role in keeping those customers moving safely, reliably and comfortably.”\nThameslink Programme director Simon Blanchflower said: “Providing a frequent and reliable service through the heart of the city to a host of new destinations will only be possible thanks to this technology.\n“Traffic management technology will provide extra guidance to our signallers and work with in-cab signalling and automatic train operation to deliver 24 trains per hour between London Blackfriars and St Pancras International. It will also improve the time it takes the railway to recover from delays and deliver enhanced customer information, to improve performance and passengers’ experience of our railway.”\nKaren Boswell, managing director of Hitachi Rail Europe, said: “This is a fantastic achievement for Hitachi Rail in the UK, following on the back of the Class 395 high speed trains in 2009, the InterCity Express Programme (IEP) contract in July 2012 and Abellio’s ScotRail contract signed in March this year.\n“Hitachi Rail is determined to strengthen its railway-related business in the UK and I look forward to working with Network Rail to deploy our proven Traffic Management System, which will bring significant benefits to rail commuters.”\nNetwork Rail’s core Thameslink contract with Hitachi Rail Europe covers a distance equal to 20 minutes’ travel time on either end of the central section between Blackfriars and St Pancras International. In addition, the contract includes options to expand the scope to cover the whole of the Brighton Main Line and part of the East Coast Main Line.\nTraffic Management systems are used extensively in Japan, notably on the high-speed Shinkansen lines and busy commuter railways.\nSource:- Network Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T04:13:28.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
