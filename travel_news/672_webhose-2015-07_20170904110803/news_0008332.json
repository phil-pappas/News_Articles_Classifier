You’re stuck at your desk and the day seems to be going on forever. Your mind start s to wander — at first to “anywhere but here,” but then to exotic, faraway lands where your everyday problems and stress melt in the presence of true paradise. You want to go to there, and we want to go with you. Every day at 3 p.m. Eastern, we’ll send you a picture of the place we at Yahoo Travel are daydreaming about so we can all take that mental vacation together. Let’s go to… \nPhoto: John Kroll/Flickr \n…The Eiffel Tower!!! It’s at the top of every Paris bucket list, and for good reason! Aside from being the most recognizable Parisian landmark, it’s frame stretches high above the streets of Paris making it impossible to miss. In this daydream, there are no crowds. Just you, your loved ones and perhaps a nutella crepe. If the tower isn’t your thing, there are plenty of other things to see and do in Paris. There is Ladurée dessert shop, that has the best macarons in all of France, The Louvre Museum (home of the Mona Lisa), The Seine, The Jardin du Luxembourg, Centre Georges Pompidou, Montmartre (where parts of “Amélie” were filmed), Versailles, The Panthéon, Notre-Dame de Paris, The Arc de Triomphe, even a drive to the countryside is not out of the question. To quote Charles Dickens “What an immense impression Paris made upon me. It is the most extraordinary place in the world!” Tumblr", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T22:23:52.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
