Roughly ten times smaller than London, sitting just off the coast of Turkey, Kos could be the surprise package you are looking for.\nHere are five reasons the magical little island is worth visiting...\nPeace and quiet or the night life - it's your call\nOn Kos, everything's up to you.\nFor those of you looking to kick up your heels and dance like nobody's everybody's watching - there's Kos Town: busy, noisy and with a nightlife that lives up to it's TV reputation, you wont have any trouble finding a dancing partner.\nAlternatively for those looking to keep this a little more low key, there's a wide range of hotels offering the quiet life, peace, seclusion and a real chance to get away from the hustle and bustle of daily life.\nActivities galore\nTying into that, there is plenty to do on the island. For those into their sports, most hotels and villages have facilities, football pitches, tennis courts and more.\nAnd, when it comes to the water, virtually every populated beach has its choice of scuba diving, paragliding and jetskis.\nFor the riders amongst you, there are brilliant go-karting tracks - and the cycling routes in Kos are quite unique. Along the coast, feel the breeze, soak in the sun and enjoy roads with few cars even at the busiest of times.\nTemperatures for your tan\nIt gets hot - really hot. So, if you are a sun-seeker, look no further. Even in June, the island averages in the mid-30s (celsius), although windy days can feel a little cooler. July and August see the numbers soar...\nIf you aren't a fan of the heat, though, give it a good think: some of the island's hotels aren't exactly famous for their air conditioning.\nZia - an unforgettable experience\nOne aspect of Kos that will be universally enjoyed, however, is something rather special: Zia by night.\nAn evening trip can be booked with a number of holiday providers while on the island, Zia is an unforgettable, breathtaking place that will make a lasting impression.\nTaking a coach ride up into the mountains, this tour sees you settle into a cosy, homely market village full of shops, cafes and restaurants - from which you can watch the beautiful sunset whilst overlooking Turkey. Very few places in Europe will offer a view like it.\nOne for the scientists\nThere's something for everyone on Kos - and the scientists among you will love the fact the island boasts one of only 10 of the world's active volcanoes. You can take a day-trip to the volcano itself and it's 'bubble beach,' where natural springs blow bubbles from underneath the water to create a natural Jacuzzi effect.\nSEE ALSO: Evangeline Lilly negative about Ant-Man comics\nNB. For those of you worried about how the financial crisis may affect your holiday : The official advice from the Foreign Office is: “Make sure you have enough euros in cash to cover emergencies, unforeseen circumstances and any unexpected delays.” It may be a good idea to make sure you have paid for large expenses such as hotels and car rentals before you arrive. On the flip side, the £ is particularly strong against the € at the moment so holidaying in Europe in 2015 will be easy on your wallet!", "external_links": ["http://cdn3-i.hitc-s.com/249/beach_sun_bath_greece_127780.jpg", "http://cdn3-i.hitc-s.com/249/zia_greek_island_of_kos_127762.jpg", "http://cdn3-i.hitc-s.com/249/kos_greece_pool_127771.jpg", "http://cdn3-i.hitc-s.com/249/vulcano_at_nissyros_127789.jpg", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/4658593/04-noNetworks-noAdsense-mpu&sz=300x250&t=vertical%3Dlifestyle&mob=js&c=", "http://cdn3-i.hitc-s.com/249/bikes_in_tigaki_127744.jpg", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/4658593/04-noNetworks-noAdsense-mpu&sz=300x250&t=vertical%3Dlifestyle&mob=js&c="], "published": "2015-07-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T20:36:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
