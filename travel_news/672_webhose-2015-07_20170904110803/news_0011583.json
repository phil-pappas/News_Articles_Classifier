What is important to you when you travel? \nToday, a 5-star rating is generally equated with luxury. \nBut how honest is that? Surely most of us do not fall into that 2 percent of the world population that can readily take a trip that takes advantage of luxury options. \nThe more decadent the hotel or airline, the higher the number of stars it can achieve. \nBut at eTurboNews, we believe whether it is an airline or a budget hotel, whether it is going first class or in coach, or whether staying in a 5-star dream hotel or a youth hostel, a 5-star rating should apply more to how smart an entity is. \nHow smart are they about their services, the items and amenities they provide, their staff? What truly should be worthy of an honest 5-star rating? \nThey say in life it’s the simple things. And it is likely those simple memorable things that makes a traveler return over and over again to the same airline, the same hotel, the same restaurant, the same little shop, or the same destination. \n\"Achievements are something that a destination needs to earn – honestly – in ways that truly mean something to travelers,” said eTurboNews Publisher Juergen T. Steinmetz. \nWe know that a traveler’s needs, wants, and desires are all about personal perception. And this award is not about rating how “luxurious” something is; it is more about rating how much something is appreciated or is different. \nAlso it's important that an entity responds to feedback and how honest they are about their product. And this is what has spawned the idea for the eTN Honest Travel Awards. \nHow does it work? \nWhether as a traveler, you have something positive or negative to say or a request or suggestion to make, the Honest Travel Awards is the place where you can say it. We are encouraging readers to send us feedback. It can be done online simply by going to honesttravelawards.com \nIt should be a first-hand observation. \nOf course there are those business that simply won’t change or will not be responsive. eTN will still provide them a rating based on the following: \n5-stars: Superb experience and response 4-stars: Good experience and response 3-stars: Acceptable experience and response 2-stars: No response 1-star: Negative response \nWe welcome our readers – and anyone else for that matter – to tell us their stories about the good, the bad, the ugly, and the stupendous – just make sure it’s honest. \nIt's about celebrating travel and tourism!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T02:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T04:05:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
