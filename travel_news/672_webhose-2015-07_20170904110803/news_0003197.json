Industrial action must be backed by at least 40% of those entitled to vote.\nCredit: PA We know that these brutal new anti-union laws are specifically targeted at our members in the transport sector who have shown in recent months that they have the guts to stand up and fight for jobs, pay, services and safety.\n– Mick Cash, RMT General Secretary London Underground workers are due to stage a second strike over pay and new night shifts on August.
