It was food. \n\"I just wanted to sit down and have a meal, cooked by somebody else,\" Clark said. \nClark, who once spent three years of his life bedridden after a car crash fractured his vertebrae, officially completed the trail last week after launching from the Alabama-Georgia border on May 20. \nHe spent almost two months paddling his canoe from the Coosa River north of Gadsden all the way across Alabama to Fort Morgan, where Mobile Bay meets the Gulf of Mexico. He spent his nights camping alongside the river and eating mostly packaged trail foods supplemented with edible plants or fish he was able to catch along the way. \nHe was able to make one notable exception late in the trail, when helpful American Legion members who had heard about his journey took him to Wintzell's Oyster House in Fairhope before his final push across Mobile Bay. \nHe liked the food so much, he went back to the same Wintzell's location for dinner on the day he finished the trail at Fort Morgan. \nThe last time Clark spoke with AL.com , he was paddling down the Alabama River through the Black Belt, about to enter the Mobile-Tensaw Delta. \nClark said that once he got into the Delta, the sights and sounds changed. He said it was nice to have different sounds to fall asleep to, but not all the Delta sounds were soothing. \n\"I heard some mysterious screaming noises, it sounded like a crazy person cackling or screaming out in the woods,\" Clark said. \"I still have no clue what that was.\" \nIn Mobile Bay, Clark said he had a pair of dolphins accompany him for part of the trek. Closer to Fort Morgan, he was joined by a curious shark. \n\"I never got a really good look (at the shark),\" Clark said. \"It stayed about 20 feet away and circled around my canoe a couple of times and then I didn't see it again. It was probably just trying to figure out what that 16-foot green thing in the water was.\" \nClark said the last day was one of the hardest, as strong headwinds worked against him as he paddled to reach the finish line at Fort Morgan and two-foot white caps splashed over into his canoe. \n\"Any time I quit paddling to drink water or anything, I'd lose like 50 yards,\" he said. \nA few days after his return, Clark said he was happy to have completed the trail. \n\"It was a great trip,\" he said. \"I loved it. There were times when it was pretty rough, but I'm glad I kept pushing on. \n\"It's a beautiful trail, it was just so cool to be able to go from the foothills of the mountains and just to go through those different ecosystems and see the plants change.\" \nHe spent the weekend back in civilization, staying with his family in Hoover, but still had some adjusting to do after spending almost two months on the trail. \n\"The past two nights I've woken up in a panic, thinking I was asleep in my boat, and that I'd floated off in the middle of the night and was stuck in the cypress knees,\" Clark said. \"I would instinctively not move because I didn't want to tip the boat, and it would take me a minute to realize 'Oh, those are lamps and I'm in a room.'\" \nClark's whirlwind summer continues, as he is now heading to Brazil and then Peru to study herbal medicine with local experts there for the summer. Clark credits herbal medicines with helping him recover from his car accident and break his dependence on prescription pain medications. \nIn the fall, he will return to his previous home in Seattle to work in a research lab at Bastyr University. Next year, he hopes to enroll in the University of Mississippi's highly competitive doctoral program in pharmacognosy , which the school defines as \"the study of bioactive natural substances found in terrestrial and marine organisms.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T01:59:19.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
