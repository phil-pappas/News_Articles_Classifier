It's become a symbol for Key Largo's John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, which is part of the sanctuary.\nThe statue, a replica of a sculpture in Italy, is a tourist attraction for snorkelers, divers and passengers on glass-bottom boats who can see it from the surface.\nTo mark the anniversary, the Amoray Dive Resort in Key Largo is sponsoring a contest with a prize of an underwater wedding at the statue and a stay at the resort for the best 100-word essay from a couple who would like to be married under the sea. Submission deadline is July 31; details at http://www.fla-keys.com/news/news.cfm?sid=9152 .\n___\nERIE CANAL TRAIL\nThere's more than one way to travel the Erie Canal and it doesn't have to be by boat.\nA new website http://www.CycletheErieCanal.com is all about cycling the mostly flat 360-mile trail that runs alongside the famous waterway in upstate New York between Albany and Buffalo.\nThe website includes rider reviews, an interactive map, places to stay and suggestions for things to do and see along the way, from the Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown to the Susan B. Anthony House in Rochester.\nThe canal was built to transport goods by boat in the early 1800s.\n___\nCOUCHSURFING COMMUNITY\nThe Couchsurfing community is getting out and off the couch with a series of events called Couch Crashes organized by local Couchsurfing hosts.\nCouchsurfing.com connects travellers with people willing to host them in their homes.\nThe accommodations-sharing network kicked off this summer's Couch Crashes with events in the Twin Cities and San Diego. They continue with a beer and cheese event, pub crawl, lake outing and picnic brunch in Madison, Wisconsin, July 23-26; a city tour and tango event among others in Buenos Aires, Aug. 15-17; and a tram party and more in Milan, Italy, Sept. 24-27.\nTo attend, register for the Couchsurfing community and sign up in the events section. Need a place to stay? Use the \"create a public trip\" function on the site for the time and place of the Couch Crash you're interested in attending, and potential hosts in the area can reach out.\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T09:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T03:10:23.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
