BAC has announced its 2016 Mono blasted up the hillclimb course at the Festival of Speed in June in 47.9 seconds – comfortably faster not only than the 51.33 seconds laid down by Anthony Reid in the Noble M600 which won the Michelin Supercar Run this year, but also the 49.27-second track record for road cars set by Jann Mardenborough in a Nissan GT-R Nismo at 2014's Festival. However, the Mono wasn’t eligible for timing as it featured a new 2.5-litre engine, prepared by engine tuner Mountune, which is still at the pre-production prototype stage. As a result, the car had to run in as a prototype in the First Glance class, rather than as a production road car. Nevertheless, BAC says it’s confident it’ll be able to return next year with the new engine installed and type-approved for production. BAC’s time was recorded using its own on-board telemetry system, and Oliver Webb, BAC’s test driver, who drove the car at Goodwood, said he was happy the company could come back and repeat the feat officially in 2016. “As Goodwood regulars will know, this class is not timed but our on-board telemetry showed that all of our runs were comfortably sub-50 seconds. “Our time would have been faster than the quickest time set in this year’s supercar shoot out and would even have beaten the fastest road car time ever recorded on the hillclimb, by the Nissan GT-R Nismo Time Attack car. “Clearly, our times were unofficial, but I would love to come back next year and challenge for the record officially, on new tyres and with our latest-spec Mountune engine.” Fighting talk from BAC, which means it looks like rival low-volume British supercar firm Noble will have a challenge on its hands if it’s to retain its crown at next year’s supercar show-down.
