Readers particularly showed interest in the sporty AMC Javelin driven by Alabama State Troopers in the early 1970s. \nCliff Antrobus of Orange Beach shared this fun story via email: \"I got pulled over by an Alabama trooper, who had a 1971 Javelin, for speeding. I saw him pulling out of the woods so I waited for him because I did not recognize the car type. I got out of my car before he did. When he got out I stated that I had never seen one and that it looked very nice. He stated that it looked even better on the inside and told me to hop in. I was very impressed with the inside, as well. I kept on telling him how nice his car was and finally he stated that he had to get back to work. He never gave me that ticket.\" \nAntrobus' fascination with the car continues to this day. \"In 1973, I bought a Javelin for my own,\" he wrote. \"A person hit me in that car and I eventually had to sell it. I bought a 1974 Javelin with the AMX package in 1991 and fully restored it. I still have that one.\" \nCheck out the Javelin interior and other vintage police cars in the accompanying gallery. \nIf you'd like to add a photo to the gallery, email kkazek@al.com .
