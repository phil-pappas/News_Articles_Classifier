The TSA confirms a man tried to put his cat through an airport security x-ray machine last week. Getty Images Airport security would have been the optimal spot to let this particular cat of the bag. Literally. A passenger traveling through Los Angeles last week had a cat in a bag — not a pet carrier case — and sent the tabby through the X-ray machine at LAX, the Transportation Security Administration confirmed. \"The passenger put the bag and cat through one of the TSA X-ray machines at passenger security screening,\" the TSA said. The cat was discovered by the TSA officer looking at the X-ray machine monitor. The cat was apparently not harmed.\" According to people who claim to have witnessed the event, chaos ensued when the agent discovered the cat in the bag. Sara Benincasa, a comedian and author from Brooklyn, tweeted: \nStanding in front of guy at TSA. I hand him a bin. I turn away and go through the scanner. I hear screams. HE PUT HIS CAT IN THE BIN. — Sara Benincasa (@SaraJBenincasa) July 1, 2015 \nThe TSA folks at Terminal 3 at LAX are animal lovers. They lost their s*** when that dude put his cat through the scanner. RAGE. — Sara Benincasa (@SaraJBenincasa) July 1, 2015 \nI have seen people pulled out of the TSA line for knives. Guns. I have never seen the rage of the TSA when dude just put his cat in the XRay — Sara Benincasa (@SaraJBenincasa) July 1, 2015 Comedians Randy and Jason Sklar also got in on the tweeting. \nThe amount of screaming that's happening in the Jet Blue terminal at LAX is incredible right now and yet it feels completely appropriate. — The Sklar Brothers (@SklarBrothers) July 1, 2015 According to the TSA, people trying to X-ray their animals is \"not an unusual occurrence.\" The official TSA Blog reads: \"We do not X-ray pets. However, there have been many occasions where passengers have assumed their pet needed to go through the X-ray. You can imagine the surprise of the X-ray operator when they see Fluffy’s skeleton roll across their monitor.\" Cue the screaming. The right way to bring your pet through security ? Take the pet out of its carrier. Walk it through the metal detector, either in your arms or on a leash.
