But it is the furnace in which the priceless asset of our National Parks was forged. Look at a geological map of Britain and you will see one of the most complicated geologies of a land mass our size anywhere in the world. And it is the primary reason we are blessed with such a huge variety of inspirational landscapes. There are 15 National Parks in mainland Britain – 10 in England, three in Wales, two in Scotland – and in a land as crowded as ours, they are more precious than ever. As well as an invaluable recreational resource, they are biodiversity hotspots, a final refuge for endangered species such as the golden eagle in the Cairngorms or the swallowtail butterfly in the Norfolk Broads. • Britain from above: 12 glorious views from the sky • Quiz: how well do you know Great Britain? Over the years I’ve walked, cycled, caved, climbed, swum, coasteered, sailed, kayaked, dived, ridden or flown a paraglider in every one of our National Parks bar one (Loch Lomond and the Trossachs, I promise to visit soon). Singling some out for special mention feels like a betrayal, like naming a favourite child, and is based more on my own particularly fond memories than any objective pecking order of merit. Described in detail are the six I know best. Dartmoor Like first love, I will always burn a flame for my beloved Dartmoor . It gave me my first experience of true wilderness. I was 19, and along with a school friend, a rucksack, some nylon sleeping bags and a one-man tent, we strode out confidently one summer evening long ago. Like first love, things did not go smoothly. We wandered into bogs that tried to suck us under and nearly died of fright mistaking Dartmoor’s ponies for wandering ghouls in the dead of night. But, in between, we swam in the translucent whisky-coloured waters of the River Dart, followed the footsteps of innumerable forgotten ancestors along stone rows and into stone circles – Dartmoor has an amazing 1,208 ancient monuments – and discovered the spiritual home of Tolkien’s Ents in Wistman’s Wood, one of three high-altitude dwarf pedunculate oak woodlands and one of the most powerfully atmospheric ancient forests in the country. The park is the largest open space in southern England and the Two Moors Way that runs 102 miles north-south across Devon is a great introduction to both Dartmoor and Exmoor. South Downs The South Downs have been my home for the past 15 years. In that time I have walked the South Downs Way from Winchester to Eastbourne (96 miles out of a total of 2,000 miles of public rights of way) and galloped at sunset over Firle Beacon while looking out over the south coast (Seven Sisters and Beachy Head) with the North Downs clearly visible more than 30 miles away on the horizon. I have criss-crossed the chalk downland on my mountain bike and I ride for an hour most days on my road bike through the Sussex Weald (still within the park’s borders) through some of the quietest country lanes in the country. It was here I learnt to paraglide, ridge soaring for hours at a time over Mount Caburn and flying cross-country from Devil’s Dyke. The newest National Park, created in 2010, we have Bronze Age barrows, Iron Age hill forts, Saxon and Norman churches and the largest number of conservation areas (165) of any UK National Park, testament to the biodiversity of its flora and fauna, including rare orchids and butterflies. Pembrokeshire Coast Named for its 260 miles of coastline, the park contains almost the whole of the 186-mile Pembrokeshire Coast Path , which has been voted among the best hiking routes in the world. The coastline attracts clichés like a magnet for good reason. My jaw has dropped, my breath been taken away, and my mind blown on numerous occasions. Often called a “peninsula of peninsulas”, its numerous headlands, creeks, bays, estuaries, lakes, lagoons, wooded valleys, coves and remote, idyllic beaches hide numerous historic sites, from Iron Age hill forts to the beach where Henry Tudor landed his forces before defeating Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 (Mill Bay on the Dale Peninsula). It is also home to seven National Nature Reserves including my favourite, Bosherston Lily Ponds, in the far south west. The surrounding Marine Nature Reserve mostly falls within the park boundaries and I can personally verify it is one of the top locations in the UK for outdoor sports including walking, cycling, riding, surfing, kayaking, climbing and some sublime coasteering. Yorkshire Dales I have loved the Yorkshire Dales ever since I was unleashed into the all-embracing arms of its patchwork of drystone walls, flower-rich hay meadows, fells, valleys and impossibly beautiful Dales villages as a 16-year-old schoolboy on a Duke of Edinburgh expedition along the Pennine Way, England’s first National Trail. As well as learning the hard way that there is a reason walkers carry water with them on a hot summer’s day, I heard about the extraordinary properties of karst and those underground cathedrals of eroded limestone that include 2,000 caves and potholes and more than 250 miles of surveyed passages. I have returned many times to go caving (Long Churn and Alum Pot) but always with an expert guide, as flash flooding is an ever-present possibility. Gaping Gill, on the southern slopes of Ingleborough, is high on my list of must-dos. With a 330ft main shaft, the interior would engulf York Minster and is the largest cavern in the UK. During Winch Meets (May and August bank holidays), members of the public are winched down and the cave is floodlit. • Britain's most tranquil places • Britain's best castles The Broads A recent overnight boat trip through the Broads , usually known as the Norfolk Broads although they extend down into Suffolk, was all it took to convince me that I had missed out for too long on what was a magical watery experience. One of the best places in the world for simply messing about in boats. The smallest of our National Parks it may be (117 square miles), but the Broads have charisma in bucketloads. Often mistakenly assumed to be natural – the truth of their man-made history was not discovered until 1952 – the Broads were dug out for peat (turbary) during the medieval period and flooded when the sea level rose in the 14th century, forming the shallow lakes we know today. They are made up of 125 miles of free-flowing waterways with seven rivers connecting 63 lakes and only ever up to around 13ft deep. The waterscape is made up of marshland fields, reed beds and tangled woodland and is home to a quarter of Britain’s rarest species, including the swallowtail, Britain’s largest butterfly, and the Norfolk hawker dragonfly. Cairngorms Even its name resonates with grandeur, and the Big Daddy of our National Parks has some impressive statistics to back up its fearsome reputation. It’s the largest (1,750 square miles), with the highest peak in a National Park, Ben Macdui (4,296ft), and contains a third of UK land space over 2,000ft. This is easily the most dramatic mountain landscape in Britain, in winter cloaked in an arctic blanket of isolation and majesty. It contains a quarter of Scotland’s native forest, the largest area of native woodland in Britain and many of Britain’s purest fishing rivers. Golden eagles, peregrine falcons and osprey cruise its majestic peaks while roe deer, reindeer, mountain hare and red squirrels inhabit the woods and moorland. Other rare birds include crossbills and capercaillie, the largest species of grouse, with its dramatic fan-tailed mating display. My experiences have all been based at Glenmore Lodge, the Scottish national training centre for outdoor activities, an institution that cannot be praised too highly. From here, the mountains, both in winter and in summer, are your oyster and, most importantly, you will always be in safe hands. Brecon Beacons Rugged and remote, right, its prominent hilltops, broad valleys, gorges, waterfalls, caves and sinkholes were forged by Ice Age glaciers . Culturally Welsh to its core. Exmoor Dominated by high ancient moorland with views over both the north and south coasts, the park also contains some of the most dramatic stretches of the South West Coast Path. Lake District Attracting the largest number of visitors per year (14.8 million), its fells and lakes are internationally renowned for their distinctive beauty. Highest concentration of outdoor activity centres in the UK. Loch Lomond and the Trossachs Its mountains, moorlands, lochs (22), rivers and burns (50) are home to some of the most species-biodiverse habitats in Britain. Home of the West Highland Way , with wild camping allowed in some sections. New Forest A living remnant of medieval England awaits among the ancient oaks, heathland and coastline of what was once William the Conqueror’s hunting ground . Northumberland Ancient history from the Stone Age to the Romans (Hadrian’s Wall) is writ large among the upland moors, rivers and woodland of the Cheviot Hills and borderland country. North York Moors Hugely atmospheric upland moorland scenery , valleys and ancient woodland inland with fascinating Ice Age geology, cliffs and sheltered harbours on the coast. Peak District The UK’s first National Park (it opened on April 17 1951). It comprises a distinctive mix of high moorland, woodlands, stone walls, field barns, hamlets and villages. Snowdonia Its nine mountain ranges include many peaks more than 3,000ft. It boasts more than a hundred lakes, steep river gorges, waterfalls and some 23 miles of coastline.
