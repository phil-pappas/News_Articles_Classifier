PUBLISHED: 07:49, Fri, Jul 17, 2015 | UPDATED: 09:07, Fri, Jul 17, 2015 BBC John Challis and Sue Holderness as Boycie and Marlene in Only Fools And Horses \nSue Hodge and Jeffrey Holland will be helping Boycie and Marlene entertain the 750 passengers on Marco Polo as it sails from Tilbury to Amsterdam, Antwerp, Rouen and Honfleur in an unusual cruise that takes in the Nordsee Canal, River Scheldt and River Seine. The much-loved comedy stars will be interviewed on stage in Q&A sessions, as well as performing the acts they currently tour around British theatres. \"After being interviewed it will be thrown over to the floor, so people can ask us embarrassing questions,\" jokes John, who says he loves boats and travel, so this is his perfect gig. He will also perform his stage show, telling stories about his life and career in some of the most popular British television comedies. One of the stories he is asked to tell is about the Only Fools And Horses episode with blow up dolls. \"One time when the prop boys were trying to get the dolls back to the hotel they took them fully inflated and got into a lift and the doors opened and one of the guys said 'it's not what it looks like, because we're filming them', which was no help at all! \"That version of that situation actually got into the show when Del and Rod take the dolls out fully clothed and end up pretending they are taking the dolls out for the evening.\" The show's television spin-off, Green Green Grass, was written after John and his wife moved to Herefordshire and held a party attended by their new neighbours but also lots of old London friends. \"One was John Sullivan, the writer, who came to the party and saw me completely out of context and that inspired him to wonder what would happen if Boysie did the same.\" Sue Hodge, who played saucy waitress Mimi Labonq will be telling passengers behind the scenes stories about 'Allo 'Allo with her husband Keith Paddington Richards, who she met when he was manager of the Theatre Royal in Lincoln, where they still live.
