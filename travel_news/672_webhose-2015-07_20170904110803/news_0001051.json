Travel website TripAdvisor announced the results of its annual 2015 Travellers’ Choice awards for amusement parks, water parks, zoos and aquariums around the world today (July 15). \nThe zoo in Mandai not only came up tops in Asia, but also took the third spot in the world rankings, losing out only to San Diego Zoo (at No 1) and Spain’s Loro Parque. \n“As Singapore marks its 50th anniversary of independence in 2015, Singapore Zoo is proud to contribute towards highlighting the nation on the world travel map,” said Dr Cheng Wen-Haur, Chief Life Sciences Officer, Wildlife Reserves Singapore. \n“Being recognised as top zoo in Asia and among the top three zoos in the world by TripAdvisor travellers is a great honour, and indeed a nod to our work in wildlife conservation, education, and recreation.” \nOther Singaporean attractions that made the list include Universal Studios, which beat Hong Kong’s Ocean Park to clinch the No 1 spot in Asia for amusement parks, while the South-east Asia Aquarium ranked second for aquariums in Asia (behind the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium). The Adventure Cove Waterpark ranked ninth in the water park category. \nMr Jason Horkin, Vice President of Attractions, Resorts World Sentosa, said: “We are honoured to be recognised once again by TripAdvisor Travellers’ Choice 2015 for the strong appeal of our attractions to the travellers around the world. Universal Studios Singapore continues to be the best amusement park in Asia and we are also excited that S.E.A. Aquarium and Adventure Cove Waterpark are now ranked second Aquarium in Asia and ninth Water Park in Asia. As Asia’s ultimate destination resort, we strive to provide the most memorable moment for our guests, from thrilling rides and adventures to unforgettable oceanic journeys.” \nThe results of the awards are determined using an algorithm that takes into account the quantity and quality of reviews for amusement parks, water parks, zoos, and aquariums worldwide, which have been gathered from TripAdvisor users over a 12-month period. — TODAY More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T06:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T06:40:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
