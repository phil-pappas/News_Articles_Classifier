The Crafty Traveller: Why that lovely villa in the... The Crafty Traveller: How to make sure you and your pound go... The Crafty Traveller: Package holidays are in rude health... Even so, Thameslink services from Central London to Gatwick – which can be as quick as the Gatwick Express – will work out cheaper.\nThe Heathrow Express is currently offering an online Duo Saver deal, saving a couple £20 on a return trip – and, since the spring, children under 16 have travelled on the trains for free.\nHowever, for a couple it still works out at least £9.60 less to take the slower Heathrow Connect Paddington-Heathrow service, while for a family or couple it’s much cheaper using the Underground’s Piccadilly line.\nOn longer train journeys, travelling at peak times to/ from the airport can be exorbitant. In which case, look at much more affordable coach options with National Express .\nParking prices at airports vary by up to 50 per cent depending on how far in advance you book\nParking\nYou can often make considerable savings by booking well in advance.\nFor example, for a week’s parking at Manchester Airport’s Long Stay Terminal 2 car park, I’ve been Quote: d £79.99 booking two days ahead; £69.99 three days ahead; £59.99 a fortnight ahead; £54.99 a month ahead; and £39.99 four months ahead.\nThe pricing pattern is similar at Luton Airport, though not at all airport car parks.\nEven if you haven’t booked long ahead, do still pre-book to avoid paying massively dearer turn-up rates. You normally need to book at least 24 or 48 hours ahead to get a good advance booking deal.\nCheck which car parks and booking agents have the best rates using comparison website airport-parking-shop.co.uk .\nOff-airport car parks can be cheaper (stick to ones with Park Mark status), but not always, and given that bus transfers from them can be longer, small savings over using an official on-airport car park are not necessarily worth it.\nIf you need parking, using an airport hotel can be particularly appealing, as stay-and-park packages can be great value\nHotels\nGot an early-morning flight? Staying the night before at an airport hotel can make sense.\nAgain, book as far ahead as possible to get the best rates.\nFor example, for most nights in November, Premier Inn currently has rooms for under £40 at its London Heathrow Airport (Bath Road) and London Gatwick Airport (North Terminal) hotels, and at the Hampton by Hilton London Gatwick, conveniently joined to the North Terminal, rates are a reasonable £71 B&B.\nIf you need parking, using an airport hotel can be particularly appealing, as stay-and-park packages can be great value.\nHoliday Extras is good for comparing airport hotel rates, with and without parking.\nGet the airport in good time to avoid the need to pay for fast-track privileges, which can add up if you are in a large party\nSecurity\nSome airports offer fast-track privileges through security for a fee.\nAt Luton, Liverpool and Bristol airports, fast track costs £5 if you haven’t pre-booked, £3 to £3.95 if you have.\nThe charges are per person, so quickly add up for a family. To avoid the need to use fast track, arrive at the airport in good time.\nThe above airports, and some others, charge an extortionate £1 for resealable transparent bags to take liquids through security – bring your own.\nInstead of pricier alternatives, opt for a sandwich from food outlets such as M&S Simply Food\nFood\nTempting but costly restaurants at the major airports have proliferated – such as a Jamie’s Italian at Gatwick North, and Gordon Ramsay’s Plane Food at Heathrow’s Terminal 5.\nSave by buying sandwiches at an M&S Simply Food airport outlet – note that restrictions through security apply to liquids, not food.\nSome Heathrow restaurants are running ‘kids eat free’ offers until September 6: see heathrow.com/shops-and-restaurants/special-offers/kids-eat-free .\nRead more: Stansted Express - Trains and Transfers to Stansted Airport from London Stansted Express - Trains and Transfers to Stansted Airport from London Trains to Gatwick from Victoria | Gatwick Express | Gatwick Express Welcome to Thameslink & Great Northern Heathrow Express Trains | Trains to Heathrow from London Paddington Heathrow Connect - Home National Express Coaches | Coach, Rail & Bus Travel Throughout The UK Compare Airport Parking prices at 32 UK Airports including Gatwick, Heathrow and Manchester Premier Inn Hotels | Book Direct for Our Saver Rates Hampton Inn Hotels by City, State, Provence, and Country Airport Parking and Airport Hotels from HolidayExtras.com.
