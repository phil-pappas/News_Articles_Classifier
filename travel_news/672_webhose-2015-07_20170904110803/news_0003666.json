The status of Malang airport in East Java remains unclear. \nAirlines are warning passengers at the reopened terminals to expect significant delays, with dozens of flights backed up until the late afternoon. \nIndonesian flag carrier Garuda was due to resume flights to and from Surabaya on Friday afternoon, and had chartered two larger planes to help clear the backlog on its more popular routes. \nBut flights to the closed airports have been cancelled, with Garuda promising to evaluate the situation as it develops. \n\"Garuda Indonesia flights to and from destinations will only be resumed as each airport is reopened by the competent authority,\" the airline said in a statement. \nAirAsia had already on Friday cancelled or rescheduled half a dozen flights from Surabaya after the ministry had earlier ordered the airport to remain shut. \nIn recent days, people across the vast archipelago have taken to planes, boats and cars to head to their home towns and villages to celebrate Eid, which marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan and falls on Friday. \nAir traffic is regularly disrupted by volcanic eruptions in Indonesia, which is home to 130 active volcanoes. \nThe main concern for airlines regarding volcanic ash is not that it can affect visibility but rather it could damage aircraft, as it turns into molten glass when sucked into plane engines, according to experts.
