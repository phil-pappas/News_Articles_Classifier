It is the first time Spain’s football league has sold the broadcasting rights for its top two divisions collectively, rather than each team being free to market its own rights. More Marston’s cooks up recipe for success \nThe sale of TV rights for La Liga outside Spain is expected to yield another €600m, according to Javier Tebas, LFP president. Although a deal has yet to be announced, it is expected that the international rights will be marketed by Mediapro, a Spanish media group. \nTelefónica has been keen to boost Spain’s under-developed pay-TV sector and regards football as crucial to attracting new subscribers. \nLess than a third of Spanish households have a pay-TV subscription, significantly below rates in the UK and France. Telefónica hopes that the ability to offer all matches on one platform will boost its paid-for Movistar+ service, although competition rules mean it will also have to offer match rights to other providers. \nTelefónica will pay €600m for the 2015/2016 season, only marginally higher than the €588m that the league was paid for the domestic rights last year. The increase is expected to be more pronounced when it comes to selling the international rights, which last season were worth only €200m to the league. \nMr Tebas, the league president, has argued that collective deals — which are standard in most top European leagues — will boost Spanish clubs’ overall revenues. The rights deal is also aimed at stabilising, and possibly easing, the financial divide between the country’s top two clubs, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona, and the rest of the league. \nSpain’s top football clubs are among the most successful in the world, both on and off the pitch. According to an annual ranking by Deloitte, Real Madrid is the richest club in the world, with FC Barcelona occupying fourth place. Between them, the two Spanish teams have won four of the past seven Champions League titles, the most coveted club trophy in the game. \nIn terms of TV revenues, however, Spain has long been in the shadow cast by the English Premier League . That will probably remain so in the coming years despite the lucrative new deal. \nThe Premier League announced in February that it had auctioned the domestic television rights to its games for £5bn for three seasons beginning in 2016, a 70 per cent rise on the previous £3bn deal. The Premier League is in the process of selling its international rights but is expected to earn a further £3bn globally. Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
