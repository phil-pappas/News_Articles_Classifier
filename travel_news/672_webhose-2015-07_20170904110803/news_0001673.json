The Bureau along with the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre (SECC), academic institutions, venues, VisitScotland Business Events team and other city partners have secured almost £75million worth of conference business in the first six months of 2015 as the city’s global profile continues to soar. \nBetween January and June this year, Glasgow has confirmed an additional 229 conferences on the books until 2022 which equates to more than 65,000 delegates travelling to the city from global destinations across this period. The Bureau has reported strong sales success for the first six months of the year with bids won including: • The European Climate Change & Adaptation Conference will take place in the city in 2017 and will welcome 3,500 delegate. This is worth £1.3million to the local economy • International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering will be held at Glasgow’s SECC in 2019 and will attract 1,000 ploughing £2million into the local economy • In 2022, more than 1,000 delegates will travel to Glasgow to attend the British Association of Dermatologists at the SECC with a local economic impact of £1.5million The city beat off global competition from Barcelona, Paris and Amsterdam to secure conference bids won in the first half of 2015. The announcement comes in the year that Glasgow City Marketing Bureau confirms £1.2billion in sales figures since its inauguration a decade ago. Aileen Crawford, Head of Conventions at Glasgow City Marketing Bureau, said: “Last year was undoubtedly the most historically significant in Glasgow’s history and our profile has never been so prominent to clients and media in the meetings and conferences arena. “2014 provided us with the unique opportunity to prove our capacity, capability and credibility to the world; and we met that challenge head on. “We’ve marked the first half of 2015 with outstanding sales figures. Our proven partnership approach to bidding and winning UK and International conferences across a wealth of strategic key focus areas is reaping dividends. “We have a world class venue portfolio, world leading academic research which all contribute to a world class city; it’s a winning combination.” Kathleen Warden, Director of Sales at the SECC, said: “2014 was a massive year for the SECC and for Glasgow, it was the year the world looked to Scotland and saw just how well we can accommodate major events. However the legacy of these events is firmly in the conference and business event industry and the recent success for ourselves and the GCMB only underline this. “This year the SECC will host over 30 international association events and bring thousands of professionals to an up-skilled, up-weighted, successful and confident events city.” Neil Brownlee, Head of Business Events at VisitScotland, said: “The Glasgow Commonwealth Games thrust the city into the global spotlight like never before and there is no doubt that it has had a hugely positive effect on its business events industry. “This is an outstanding result for Glasgow and the number of high-yield conferences, several of which have been supported by the VisitScotland Conference Bid Fund, is testament to the city’s world-class facilities, its outstanding attractions and the warm welcome of its people.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T19:45:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
