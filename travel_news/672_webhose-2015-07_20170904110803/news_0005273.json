PriceWaterhouseCoopers estimates the sharing economy in the UK is currently worth £500 million and that the figure could be £9 billion by 2025. Meanwhile, the latest figures from innovation charity Nesta reckons that 25 per cent of the UK population used the internet to share assets and/or resources in the past year. So, whether it’s a spare room, a designer dress you only wore once or your gardening skills that you have to share, it’s possible to make extra cash out of them. 1. People are making an average of £465 a year renting out their driveway through JustPark .

House-swapping through LoveHomeSwap is typically saving users in London £3,300 on accommodation costs. 4. No-one to walk your dog while you’re at work? Join BorrowMyDoggy and rent him out to dog lovers who don’t have a pet of their own. 5. If your car spends more time sitting on your drive than on the road, consider sharing it via EasyCar Club , from which people can make £1,800 a year. 6. A ride-sharing service, BlaBlaCar , matches riders looking to hitch a ride with drivers interested in getting some help with fuel costs for long journeys. Riders pay a set fee directly to the driver for a seat, which is enough to help with motoring costs. 7. Got a field going spare? You can rent it out for events, such as weddings and parties, on Fieldlover . 8. Streetbank allows neighbours to share with each other. According to its website, there are currently 64,710 neighbours sharing 68,025 things – everything from tools and instruments to sofa beds, handbags and skills. There are tax implications, of course. At the moment you must pay tax on any money you make from sharing above £4,250. And if you’re sharing out your home then you need to check your insurance cover. • Learn about smart meters and find out how you can save money and time to spend on the things you love.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T18:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T14:53:58.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
