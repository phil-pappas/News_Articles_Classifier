Boats are made of anything that won’t sink, from floatable flotsam like PVC, buckets, pool noodles and lawn furniture.\nTeams paddle through Blackwater Sound during the ½-mile dash through a buoyed course between the Caribbean Club and Sundowner restaurant at mile marker 104 bayside.\nKristyn, left, and George Silver paddle their Coke float watercraft in last year’s Anything That Floats Race in Key Largo. This year’s race is Aug. 15. Photo by Bob Care of the Florida Keys News Bureau To propel themselves, teams use oars, paddles, arm power or may even hoist old T-shirts as a sail.\nThe race, which is free to watch, begins at 3 p.m. and is followed by a celebration.
