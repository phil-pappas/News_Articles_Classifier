British Airways were among the airlines affected \n\"We are sorry for the disruption to our customers' travel plans and are advising them to check their flight on ba.com.\"\nTravellers took to Twitter to vent their frustration after the demonstration caused delays around the world, leaving people stuck on runways at airports including Tel Aviv and Newcastle.\nRead more: Anti-expansion activists block Heathrow runway \nCommission report backs third runway at Heathrow \nBoris Johnson in furious row over Heathrow plans Two women on their way home to Dublin after watching the tennis at Wimbledon were angry after their flight was delayed.\nLouise Rogers, 35, said: “It's affecting an awful lot of people's lives.

Both runways are open, although there will still be delays and a few cancellations – we are sorry for the disruption to passengers. Our priority remains to ensure the safe running of the airport.”\nEarlier this month a long-awaited report recommended that a new runway should be built at Heathrow rather than its biggest rival, Gatwick.\nAfter three years of investigation, the Airports Commission said Heathrow was best placed to provide “urgently required” capacity but environmentalists warned that building a new runway there will make it harder to reduce air pollution and emissions contributing to climate change.\nAdditional reporting by PA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T16:07:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
