Total passengers for June amounted to 162,787, a 79 per cent increase compared to the same month last year. \n\n\n\nThe strong growth can be attributed to its additional flights to Osaka-Kansai and Tokyo-Narita since early June, as well as the launch of new routes to Lanzhou and Dunhuang in China and Magong in Taiwan, said Andrew Cohen, CEO of HK Express, in a press statement. \n\nThe airline has also added 17 weekly flights to popular Asian cities including Chiang Mai and Danang to cater to high demand for travel during this summer season, he added. \n\n“These additions were made possible with the delivery of two additional (Airbus) A320 aircraft into our fleet, for a total of 12 with one more aircraft to come before year-end,” Cohen said. \n\nIt is launching services to Bangkok-Don Mueang today, while flights to Siem Reap and Jeju will start on September 1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T11:42:57.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
