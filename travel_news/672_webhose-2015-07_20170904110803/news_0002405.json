One thing stands above the rest though, and that's a helicopter tour of the Grand Canyon. You can pick different tour options to create an experience you're sure to love. If you want a luxury experience or if you need something kind to a tight budget, you can find a tour that fits. It only takes about an hour to fly from Vegas to the Grand Canyon by helicopter since they are only about one hundred miles apart. Besides the canyon itself, you'll also see breathtaking views of landmarks like Hoover Dam and Lake Mead on the way. When you take a helicopter tour out of Vegas, you can land at the canyon for a while or you can just fly over it and return to the city. Landing tours are the most comprehensive, because you can go within the canyon to land at the bottom, or on the rim of the canyon near the world famous Skywalk. There's even a tour that includes a picnic at the bottom next to the Colorado River. Landing Tours With Extras If you book a tour package that includes a landing on the canyon floor, you can add on a scenic boat ride. You'll float along the smooth water section of the Colorado River where you can view the canyon from a truly unique perspective. If you're feeling extra adventurous, you can also land at the top and take a walk out over the Skywalk. This has become the most popular attraction at the canyon, and when you step out 70ft over the edge you will understand why. Basic air tours are available if you have a limited budget. A basic tour offers a sightseeing experience that is about equal to that of the other tours, you just have to sacrifice some comforts. For instance, they don't lift off from a convenient location in Vegas, the take off from nearby Boulder City instead. If you want extra comfort and convenience, then book a deluxe tour, but don't worry about sacrificing sightseeing on a basic tour, because they both provide awesome scenic views. Perks Of Tours On Deluxe Grand Canyon Helicopters The deluxe tours come with some nice perks. The tours come with complimentary limousine transportation to and from your Vegas hotel, and the flights lift off from the Vegas Strip. This means you will also be treated to a flyover of The Strip, adding even more value to the tour. Deluxe tours fly on EcoStar 130 helicopters that are made for the purpose of sightseeing in comfort. Not only do they feature a massive 180 degree viewing window, but they also feature seating designed so that everyone inside has a 'front row' seat. They're quieter than other helicopters, and they're more spacious too. Dress For The Weather The Grand Canyon gets very hot during the summer months. Air tours are climate controlled so you'll be comfortable in the cabin. For those who choose landing tours, prepare with high SPF sunscreen, sunglasses, a cap, and lightweight clothing that covers as much skin as possible. It can often hit 100 degrees at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. Conclusion If you're looking for the ultimate sightseeing experience, then you should definitely take a helicopter tour of the Grand Canyon. You have a lot of choices in activities and can choose a landing tour or air tour and can pick it in a basic or deluxe version. Book your tour about two weeks in advance so it won't be sold out. Book it online too because you'll find the lowest price there when you use the Internet discount. An air tour of the Grand Canyon is an experience you'll never forget, so don't put it off another year. \nGrand Canyon expert Lea Fallon recommends these superior South Rim helicopters and these extraordinary tours that depart daily from Las Vegas: http://www.grandcanyonhelicopters.org/las-vegas/   09   1  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T03:46:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
