That’s a real sweet spot for any national tourism organisation and why we’re so focused upon developing a targeted event strategy to maximise the tourism potential and economic return of Australia’s year round calendar of top quality events,” Mr O’Sullivan said. \n\n\nMr O’Sullivan said that the publication of the PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report was timely, coming just days after the launch of the Australian Government’s ‘sports diplomacy’ strategy at Parliament House. \n\n\nHe said Tourism Australia would continue to work closely with event organisers, state and territory tourism partners and its own overseas offices to identify and promote those events which it believed appealed mostly strongly to consumers in its target inbound markets. \n\n\nThe Australian Government’s sports diplomacy strategy aims to bring together government and sporting organisations to leverage Australia’s sporting skills, facilities and knowledge to promote Australia and help strengthen international relationships with countries around the world. \n\n\nA key element of this sports diplomacy strategy is to highlight Australia’s excellent track record in hosting major sporting events like the ICC Cricket World Cup, and the opportunity they provide to showcase Australia more broadly and generate long-term economic, diplomatic, tourism and community benefits. \n\n\nThe release of the PwC report comes just days after international arrivals data from the Australian Bureau of Statistic (ABS) revealed a 46% spike in visitor arrivals from India during. the month of March, coinciding with their team’s appearance in the semi-final of Cricket World Cup.
