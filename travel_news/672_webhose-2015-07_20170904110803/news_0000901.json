Should you arm yourselfexpecting a shower, or dress for a bright, sunny day? We pose these questions to Archana Walavalkar , stylist to actors like Imran Khan and Alia Bhatt, and co-founder and creative director at StyleCracker, a personalised styling platform. \nFOR WOMEN Work “Pair a bright-coloured, shift dress with water-repellent ballet flats. Layer it with a colourless, sheer rain cape and let it be the hero of your look. It’s uncomplicated, keeps your attire wrinkle-free, and lets you flaunt your OOTD (outfit of the day).” \nBrunch “Match a wrap-style romper with cut-off shoulders and fun-coloured Havaianas. If you feel indulgent, opt for an embellished pair. Finish the look with a khaki parka. It’s versatile, utilitarian and my personal favourite for this season.” \nNight out “Keep your clothing fuss-free if the weather looks dicey. Cut-off shorts with a slouchy, oversized top is a safe bet. Complete the look with block-heeled gladiator sandals.” \n***FOR MEN Work “A mackintosh (waterproof coat) suits both formal and casual looks; it’s also practical to carry while travelling. If it’s the brisk look you’re after, opt for a smart rain pea coat instead.” \nBrunch “Keep it minimal with rolled-up chinos, a collared T-shirt and low-cut waterproof leather slip-ons. Their slightly raised platform will keep you out of puddles. The waterproof, matte rain sneaker (a hybrid of the rain boot and sneaker) is a great-buy for the season.” \nNight out “Match an ultra-lightweight windcheater with a casual tee and make it a part of your look for the night. Keep the colours of your jacket zesty to disrupt the dreary weather.” \n(Photos: StyleCracker)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T18:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T02:32:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
