When he passed by the basilica, somehow he felt the need for a confession.\n\"He heard no voices, saw no visions, but that confession was a transcendental experience. He left with a strong conviction that he had to become a priest.\"\nWhat about his friends?\n\"He forgot about them and went home.\"\nOutside, Vega gives us the back story.\nHow the Bergoglio family had a candy store in Portacomaro, in Italy.\nHow they left for Argentina on the steamer Giulio Cesare in January 1929 to escape the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini.\nDaniel adds that delays in selling their shop made them miss the earlier sailing of Principessa Mafalda.\nPope Francis's boyhood kindergarten. Papal ice cream\nIt sank in October 1927 off the coast of Brazil with the loss of 314 lives.\nWhether true or false, this act of apparent divine providence has already entered popular mythology.\nThe Pope's popularity has helped local businesses.\nIn front of us stands a pizzeria, cheekily named \"Habemus Pizza y Pasta\" after the traditional \"Habemus Papam\" announcement following a pope's election.\nA team of Argentinian ice cream makers have already presented His Holiness with his own ice cream flavor: vanilla and lemon, in the papacy's traditional colors of white and yellow.\nWe stop in front of a white one-story terraced house at Calle Varela 268.\nThere are bars on the windows and the twin external doors lead to two separate flats.\nIt's all so ordinary except for the plaque: \"Pope Francis was born here.\"\nUntil October 2014 another address at Calle Membrillar was considered to be the Pope's childhood home.\nIndeed, when this tour started Pope Francis asked: \"Which house do they go to?\"\nWhen asked what he meant, he waved it away: \"Let the poor neighbors live in peace.\"\nNot any more.\nThis address was discovered by historian Daniel Vargas who dug out the Pope's birth certificate and sent a copy to the Vatican.\nImagine his shock when his office phone rang: Pope Francis wanted a word.\nIt was a word of confirmation.\nLittle Jorge Bergoglio spent the first five years of his life here.\nPapal pizza. Love letter\nOnly when the family expanded did they move to a bigger house at Calle Membrillar.\nThere's no doubt about our next stop a few blocks south.\nA bright red exterior announces Escuela Pedro Antonio Cervino, a mixed primary school that Pope Francis attended.\nThe pervading silence is a reminder that it's summer vacation time.\nAfter Cardinal Bergoglio's election as pope, an elderly neighborhood woman claimed to have been his childhood sweetheart.\n\"He wrote me a love letter\", she insisted. \"And said that if I didn't marry him, he'd become a priest!\"\nThe media demanded to see the letter.\n\"When my father saw it, he tore it to pieces,\" she said.\n\"We were only 12!\"\nThe media swooned.\nFurther south, the barrio becomes more residential.\nA small breeze hits us as we climb uphill.\nWe walk by several freshly painted colonial-style houses with well-tended patios.\nThe Pope's father was an accountant and was comfortably off.\nAt Membrillar 531 we find the house where Jorge Bergoglio spent his youth.\nAs a marker of the Pope's past it scores high in disappointment, because it's been comprehensively rebuilt.\nThe Buenos Aires Tourist Board must have been greatly relieved when the more photogenic Varela residence was discovered.\nThe birth place of Pope Francis. Soccer saints\nOpposite there is a square where Pope Francis played soccer as a kid.\nHe's still a card-carrying fan of his local team San Lorenzo de Almagro (nickname: The Saints).\nAfter his election San Lorenzo wore his image on their shirts for the next match.\nThey won 1-0 after their opponents scored an own goal.\nNo one here doubts it was a miracle.\nThe final stop blessed by the presence of Pope Francis is the kindergarten in the Misericordia College.\nThis is where he had his first communion and learned to count to 10, jumping down the entrance steps.\n\"He returned to the college afterward as archbishop of Buenos Aires\", says Vega.\n\"They still remember how he helped wash the dishes\".\nIt's probably because of memories like these that Pope Francis has his own tour.", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150611103330-pope-hometown-argentina--childhood-home-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150610100302-pope-hometown-argentina-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150611103330-pope-hometown-argentina--childhood-home-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150611122155-pope-hometown-argentina--kindergarten-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150611122155-pope-hometown-argentina--kindergarten-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150610100302-pope-hometown-argentina-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150610100302-pope-hometown-argentina-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150611103330-pope-hometown-argentina--childhood-home-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150611122155-pope-hometown-argentina--kindergarten-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150611122155-pope-hometown-argentina--kindergarten-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150610100302-pope-hometown-argentina-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150610100302-pope-hometown-argentina-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150611122155-pope-hometown-argentina--kindergarten-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150610100302-pope-hometown-argentina-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150611122155-pope-hometown-argentina--kindergarten-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150611103330-pope-hometown-argentina--childhood-home-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150611103330-pope-hometown-argentina--childhood-home-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150611103330-pope-hometown-argentina--childhood-home-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150611103330-pope-hometown-argentina--childhood-home-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150611122155-pope-hometown-argentina--kindergarten-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150610100302-pope-hometown-argentina-exlarge-169.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-15T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T13:23:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
