Monument to the LeBlanc sisters, Magnolia Cemetery, Mobile\nIn Magnolia Cemetery, two thoughtful cherubs mark the graves of Margaret Langdon LeBlanc and Jane Stewart LeBlanc, sisters who died as children – Margaret at 18 months in 1919 and Jane at age 4 in 1918. The Neo-Renaissance statue was erected by their grandmother, Jane Stewart LeBlanc.\n2. Victor Valentine Manfredo, Elmwood Cemetery, Birmingham\nFigural memorials in the likeness of the deceased are rare, and rarer still are the figures of men.

Syx Family, Maple Hill Cemetery, Huntsville\nA statue featuring an angel reaching to the top of a cross marks the plot of the Syx family in Maple Hill Cemetery in Huntsville.\n4. You Only Live Once, Elmwood Cemetery, Birmingham\nThis marker draws photographers not because of its intricate design but because of its inscription. On its front, it says, \"You Only Live Once.\" On the next side, it says, \"But If You Do It Right...,\" followed by, \"Once Is Enough.\"\n5. William Rufus King, Live Oak Cemetery, Selma\nThe mausoleum of William Rufus de Vane King (1786-1853) is set at the entrance of Selma's historic Live Oak Cemetery. Although it is not a particularly decorative monument, it is popular because it marks the grave of only vice president of the United States who was from Alabama. He served in both the U.S. House and Senate and helped found Selma in 1818. He was sworn in as vice president in 1853 but died six weeks later of tuberculosis.\n6. Mattie O. Blunt Keith, Live Oak Cemetery, Selma\nThe grave of Mattie O. Blunt Keith (1858-1886) is located in Live Oak Cemetery beneath drapes of Spanish moss hanging from a nearby oak. The mourning figure amid the ethereal plant makes a haunting subject for photos.\n7. The Glover Mausoleum, Riverside Cemetery, Demopolis\nThe Greek Revival mausoleum built in 1845 on a bluff overlooking the Tombigbee River is one of the largest in Alabama. It holds burial vaults for 30 people. According to RuralSWAlabama.org, tt was built by Mary Anne Glover, the second wife of Allen Glover. \"Allen Glover died in 1840 and was initially buried elsewhere. The bodies of Allen Glover, his first wife, and a daughter were moved to the vaults after it was completed in 1845. A Gothic Revival cast-iron fence was later added around the vault in 1858. Ann Glover allowed other family members to be buried around the mausoleum in later years, and in 1882 she began to sell lots to the public. This led to the establishment of the site as Riverside Cemetery. The fence has experienced considerable vandalism in more recent years and has been largely removed.\" It was recorded in the historic American Buildings Survey in 1934 and listed on the National Register of Historic places in 1974.\n8. Ben Matthews, Maple Hill Cemetery, Huntsville\nThe marker for Ben Matthews, who died in 1899 at age 4, is decorated with one of the numerous statues in Maple Hill Cemetery.

It was built in 1853 by John Hope. RuralSWAlabama.org says, \"The unusual splayed eaves and vaulted, or 'compass' interior ceiling, of this grave shelter can be traced to Eastern Seaboard church yards in Delaware and Virginia. This is believed to be the only grave shelter of its type in Alabama. The shelter covers graves of six members of the John Hope family.\" It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.\n10. William Joseph Melton, Friendship Baptist Church Cemetery, Pine Apple\nAnother rare figure of a male, the statue of William Joseph Melton (1846-1900) in Friendship Baptist Church Cemetery in Pine Apple stirred controversy when it was arrived in the small community. The two-thirds life-size statue was commissioned by Corrie Melton, the daughter of the wealthy Wilcox County plantation owner. \"The statue was shipped from Italy to Claiborne, Ala., by boat,\" according to RuralSWAlabama.org. \"When it arrived at Pine Apple, church members stopped the statue from being erected in the cemetery because they felt it was a graven image, prohibited by the Ten Commandments. Eventually, permission was to given to place the monument in the cemetery, but only if it was lying down.\" Years later, the statue was erected in its upright position.\n11. Elodie Todd Dawson, Live Oak Cemetery, Selma\nElodie Todd Dawson (1844-1881) was the half-sister of Mary Todd Lincoln and, thus, the sister-in-law of Abraham Lincoln when he was president. She was married to Col. N.H.R. Dawson, a Confederate colonel who was also a member of the Alabama legislature and served as Speaker of the House. According to RuralSWAlabama.org, the grieving Dawson ordered the statue in the likeness of his wife from Italy. \"When it arrived in Selma, Col. Dawson wasn't satisfied with the hair, as it was not as beautiful as his wife's, so he returned it to Italy to be redone.\"\n12. Philip Ross, Elmwood Cemetery, Birmingham\nThe statue of a World War I soldier marks the grave of Phillip Ross (1886-1937) in Elmwood Cemetery.\n13.
