She told eTN in her email: \"I would prefer not to pursue legal means but am willing to, as there is nothing we take more seriously than our reputation for safety.\" \neTN decided not change the headline and left the question of safety open. \nToday, the US Department of Transportation’s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposed a $911,000 civil penalty against SkyWest Airlines of St. George, Utah, for allegedly operating two aircraft that were not in compliance with federal aviation regulations. \nSkywest operates on a regional airline level and is a member of the Regional Airline Association. SkyWest Airlines flies to 189 cities, in 43 states, including Washington DC, 6 Canadian provinces, 11 cities in Mexico, and the Bahamas. The airline serves as a feeder airline, operating under contract with various major carriers. It flies as SkyWest Airlines in a partnership with Alaska Airlines, as United Express on behalf of United Airlines, as Delta Connection on behalf of Delta Air Lines, and as American Eagle on behalf of American Airlines. \nThe FAA alleges SkyWest failed to inspect the cargo door skins on two Bombardier CL-600 jets at required intervals. The inspections were required by an Airworthiness Directive (AD) issued in 2006 after cracks were discovered in the aluminum cargo door skin of a CL-600 during fatigue testing. The FAA determined that regular inspections of that type of aircraft for similar cracking could help prevent a situation in which a cracked skin could lead to an accident or unsafe condition. \nSkyWest allegedly operated the aircraft on a total of 15,969 flights when the inspections were overdue. \n“Safety is our top priority,” said FAA Administrator Michael Huerta. “We expect operators to comply fully with all FAA regulations and directives.” \nSkyWest has 30 days from receipt of the FAA’s enforcement letter to respond to the agency.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T21:48:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
