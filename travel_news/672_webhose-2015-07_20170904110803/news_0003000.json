Source: Supplied\nIt is said that Monet, on the hunt for a new family home, fell in love with this former cider farm in the hamlet of Giverny, near the Normandy village of Vernon, as he saw it from a railway carriage window. He moved in, and over the next decades diverted a waterway to create a willow-washed ornamental lake and selected and tended plants to create a legacy not only for the art world but for garden lovers around the globe.\nAs the artist’s quest may have done on that auspicious day, my journey to Giverny started at Gare Saint-Lazare, a railway hub itself immortalised by Monet in a series of paintings 130 years ago. The smoking steam engines he committed to canvas are long gone, but Saint-Lazare is still one the busiest stations in Paris.\nIt’s easy enough to catch the train 45 minutes to Vernon and from there find a cab, hire a bike or even walk to Giverny. But after a few days alone in the French capital, I was ready for some company. I headed to Platform 22 where, amid the morning commuters, I joined about 35 others embarking on a day trip to Monet’s Garden with Fat Tire Bike Tours. As the name suggests, the company, founded by an American 16 years ago to show Paris to English-speaking visitors, specialises in seeing the sights on two wheels. On the bike path to Monet’s Garden.

Soon we rolled into Giverny, past the village church where Monet lies in a crypt with other members of his family.\nThe serenity, after the busyness of Paris, was refreshing. And so was not having to queue to get into the gardens for more than a minute or two – one of the benefits of being on a “skip-the-line” tour.\nBehind the stone walls was the Japanese-style water garden that Monet painted over and over at different times of the day and different times of the year.\nThough most visitors filing around the lake had phones at the ready to take snaps of its famous wooden bridge, a few traditionalists sat on benches with watercolours and sketchbooks. A second formal flower garden called Clos Normand is arranged in blocks of colour like an artist’s palette in front of Monet’s house. Paintings of Clos Normand are less common, though if you visit the Musee D’Orsay in Paris, as I had just days earlier, you can see a gilt-framed sea of irises along with some of his other Impressionist masterpieces. Quintessential French picnic.

A team of gardeners works like invisible menders, tidying up and removing spent blooms to keep everything looking its freshest. The studio where Monet painted his vast waterlily murals, prized in art institutions around the world, is now a giftshop selling souvenirs ranging from postcards through to designer jewellery and dinnerware.\nI left with a book detailing the planting schemes for the gardens throughout the seasons, and daydreamed on the bike and train ride back to Paris of re-creating an impressionist garden bed on the other side of the world.", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/602149-995f2e96-290a-11e5-b088-701fc9b6d408.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/601734-6fdf3236-260e-11e5-b856-d650f72d3e25.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/601786-71d00e44-260e-11e5-b856-d650f72d3e25.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/602255-73241132-260e-11e5-b856-d650f72d3e25.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-20T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T20:34:35.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
