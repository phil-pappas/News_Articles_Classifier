Sir Michael founded British Midland Airways (BMA and later BMI) and sold the carrier (and its Heathrow slots) to Lufthansa. \nOver the last quarter century nearly 150 distinguished members of the aviation industry have spoken in the Nash Room of the Institute of Directors. For many the most exciting moment was 6 July 2005 when the then Qantas Chief Executive, Geoff Dixon, announced to the assembly that London had won the Olympics for 2012. It was afterwards into Trafalgar Square for the celebrations. \nThe first speaker, in February 1990, was Cecil Parkinson, then Secretary of State for Transport. Michael Bishop was next up, both introduced by Peter Sanguinetti, the founding Chairman. \nAttendance is welcome by members and guests but needs pre-booking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T03:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T09:38:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
