Air Canada advises that a small number of flights may be cancelled today as a result of the rollover effect from yesterday's disruption. The airline is working to transport all customers safely to their destinations as quickly as possibly and thanks customers for their patience during the disruption. Prior to leaving for the airport, customers should check the status of their flight at www.aircanada.com or call Air Canada's automated flight information system at 1-888-422-7533. A revised ticketing policy for customers booked on affected flights to facilitate changes to bookings remains in effect until July 5 . Those customers wishing to make alternate travel arrangements can do so without penalty, space permitting, using Air Canada's online rebooking tool to check alternate travel options currently available; re-book and check in before arriving at the airport.
