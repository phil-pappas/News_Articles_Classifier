Mancham, who is active in association with the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation and who is a member of the Board of the Institute for Cultural Diplomacy, has called upon world leaders to support diplomacy and not war. \n\"Todayâ€™s long-awaited announcement of a deal between Iran and the P5+1 is a significant achievement for those who believe in the power of diplomacy to overcome differences. As we read day after day in the news, it was not easy for the parties to reach a compromise agreement, but they did it,\" Sir James stated - adding - \"Unfortunately, there are people in positions of power who still believe that war is the solution, despite the many recent tragic examples to the contrary in the Middle East.\" \nThe Nuclear Age Peace Foundation works for the abolition of nuclear weapons worldwide. \"We feel it is important that, while we work tirelessly for global nuclear abolition, we also work to uphold deals such as this one that demonstrate the power of cooperation over violence.\" \nFounding President Mancham leaves Seychelles on Friday on the way to London where in his capacity as the Chairman of the African Chapter of the Berlin-based Institute for Cultural Diplomacy, he has been invited to deliver a keynote address at the International Symposium on Cultural Diplomacy in the Commonwealth which will take place in the House of Lords from the 22nd to the 24th July 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T10:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T11:54:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
