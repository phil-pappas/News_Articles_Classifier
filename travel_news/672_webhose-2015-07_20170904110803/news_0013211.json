Around each bend, dangerous creatures — alligators, tigers and even cobras — awaited.\nThe river widened at the spot where a herd of elephants was cooling off, some spouting water toward the boat's passengers.\n\"Take as many pictures as you want. They all have their trunks on,\" khaki-clad guide Megan told her groaning passengers.\nThe bad joke is probably as old as the Jungle Cruise itself, one of the original attractions when Disneyland debuted 60 summers ago.\nStanding alongside knights on horseback at the gates of what's now Sleeping Beauty Castle, trumpeters heralded the arrival of America's first true theme park.\nTSA pays millions in baggage claims, including in Chicago Alison Bowen Travelers might be skeptical as they watch their bag move out of sight on a carousel behind the check-in counter at the airport. Travelers might be skeptical as they watch their bag move out of sight on a carousel behind the check-in counter at the airport. ( Alison Bowen ) \"Open the Fantasyland Castle in the name of the children of the world!\" a booming voice commanded. Characters from Disney films raced forward, followed by a rush of children.\nOn that Sunday, July 17, 1955, the lines were long. Temperatures were in the triple digits, and the drinking fountains didn't work. But no one seemed to care as Walt Disney welcomed the first guests to what he called \"this happy place.\"\nIn the preceding year, $17 million had been spent transforming 60 acres of orange groves into a brand now known around the world. There are Disney parks in Southern California, Central Florida, Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai. Company COO Tom Staggs proudly points to their combined visitor total, which is approaching 3 billion.\nA maker of cartoons and movies, Walt Disney's aim was pretty simple when he launched the theme park industry.\nl Related Travel Going solo at Disneyland helps the imagination go wild See all related 8 \"He was frustrated taking his own children to fun fairs and carnivals where there weren't a lot of things for families to do together,\" spokesman John McClintock explained.\nIn 1955, admission was a dollar for grown-ups and 50 cents for kids. The 20 or so attractions cost extra. A ticket for the Jungle Cruise was 30 cents.\nWhile the number of rides has tripled and now includes thrill rides such as the Indiana Jones Adventure and Star Tours, many of the 1955 originals remain. The horse-drawn streetcars still make their way along Main Street USA. Kids still soar skyward on Dumbo the Flying Elephant. And at the Mad Tea Party, families still spin in giant teacups.\n Of course, the older attractions have gone through technological upgrades over the years with Disney \"imagineers\" guiding the way. Traveling through the dark sky aboard Peter Pan's Flight, the glowing \"stars\" that now twinkle are fiber optics. Sixty years ago, they were pingpong balls dipped in fluorescent paint.\nVisitors this summer can enjoy three new nighttime shows created for the diamond anniversary.\nThe \"Paint the Night Parade\" shares eight different Disney stories as performers and floats wind through the park. The parade is billed as the first to be almost fully illuminated by LEDs. Only Rapunzel's lanterns and the tip of Tinker Bell's wand use incandescent lighting.\nAlready famous for its nightly fireworks, Disneyland takes pyrotechnics to new heights this year. The \"Disneyland Forever\" extravaganza begins with glittering pixie dust that's followed by fireworks blended with high-tech visual projections. Depending on their location, guests experience one of four unique shows.\n\"World of Color — Celebrate!\" is staged at nearby Disney California Adventure Park. Hosted by actor Neil Patrick Harris and Mickey Mouse, the new attraction takes guests on a colorful journey of imagination.\nThe new shows were designed with Southern California's 22 million residents in mind. McClintock said hundreds of thousands of them hold annual passes and need reasons to return. Even at Disneyland, the rides can apparently get tiresome after a while.\n\"We have to do things bigger and more creative in the show department on a regular basis,\" he said.\nOne local who never grows tired of visiting is Jeff Reitz, a native of nearby Huntington Beach. He's been to Disneyland every day since Dec. 31, 2011. He will mark 1,294 consecutive days on the 60th anniversary.\nReitz was unemployed when he was given an annual pass as a gift.\n\"It forced me to get up and get out of the house instead of moping around,\" he explained.\nNow employed by the Veterans Administration in Long Beach, Reitz heads to Disneyland after finishing work in the late afternoon.\n\"If I get here and it's so packed that there's an hourlong wait for Space Mountain, I'll do something else because I can always do it tomorrow,\" he said.\nReitz, who admitted that quite a few people have said he's crazy, though not always to his face, said he has no plans to stop his daily visits anytime soon.\n\"No day is ever alike,\" he concluded.\nThe small clusters of visitors wearing earbuds attached to small receivers are probably exploring the park on a behind-the-scenes tour.\nThough it costs $109 — that's in addition to the price of admission — the \"Walk in Walt's Disneyland Footsteps\" tour provides an intimate, three-hour experience chock-full of little-known lore.\nShortly after greeting his guests, guide Kory Alvarado led them to the firehouse, where a vintage red engine was parked. He said that upstairs, on the second floor, there's a small apartment that Walt used from the park's opening until his death in 1966.\n\"This is the only park that Walt Disney ever set foot in,\" Alvarado pointed out. The Orlando area's Walt Disney World was on the drawing boards in 1966, he said, but it didn't open for another five years.\nThe 60th anniversary won't bring any special activities to the Florida park, allowing the spotlight to shine solely on Disneyland, now trademarked as \"The Happiest Place on Earth.\"\nFifty years ago, on the park's 10th anniversary, Walt Disney declared its destiny, a Quote: that still echoes through Anaheim.\n\"Disneyland will never be completed,\" he declared. \"It will continue to grow as long as there is imagination left in the world.\"\nJay Jones is a freelance reporter.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5595b7cf/turbine/sc-trav-0702-tsa-baggage-loss-claims-20150702", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5596d211/turbine/sc-trav-0707-disney-anniversary-20150701", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5595a566/turbine/la-ca-mn-disneyland-60th-anniversary-solo-20150705"], "published": "2015-07-03T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T16:35:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
