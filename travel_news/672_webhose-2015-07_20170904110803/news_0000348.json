Check The Baggage Fee. Suzy Strutner Associate Lifestyle Editor, The Huffington Post Posted: 07/14/2015 | Edited: 7 minutes ago getty \nIf you think you've scored a \"cheap\" plane ticket, take another look to be sure. \nChecked-bag fees can add major costs to your trip . But many travelers often fail to realize that cheaper, \"low-cost\" airlines are sometimes where you'll wind up paying high prices in checked-bag fees ï»¿. \nSpirit Airlines, known for its super-low fares , charges those outside its \"fare club\" $30 to $100 per checked bag depending on how the tickets are booked, per the Business Insider guide below. When the average price to check your first bag is $25, that's not such a stellar deal. \nAnd be careful with some budget airlines abroad: On easyJet , you'll pay about $18 to $34 if you register your checked bag online. But make the mistake of waiting till the airport, and the price will be anywhere from about $50 (at the bag drop area) to about $70 (at the gate) . \nIn short, budget airline fees can really get you down you if you don't plan ahead. \nOf course, there are exceptions: Southwest is a winner in the baggage department , where both the first AND second checked bags fly free. And JetBlue -- which only recently started charging for checked bags -- costs $20 if you check in online or at a kiosk. \nWant to know how much your next trip will really cost, all fees considered? Check out Business Insider's guide below.
