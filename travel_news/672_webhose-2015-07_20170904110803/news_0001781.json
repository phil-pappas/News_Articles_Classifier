Although it has been adjusted and reshaped, it remains one of the most demanding and hazardous race tracks in the world, with its many chicanes, curves and traps. Britain’s three-time Formula One world champion, Jackie Stewart, called it The Green Hell for the unrelenting concentration and effort it requires of the racers. The name stuck. \nFrom March to October each year it hosts car, truck, cycling and motorbike events, including 24-hour and 1,000-kilometre races. It frequently opens to ordinary drivers eager to test – or discover – their racing skills. It is also a venue for rock concerts. \nIn 1975, Formula One driver Niki Lauda set the circuit’s record, covering the 22.8-kilometre distance of the Nordschleife, or Northern Loop, in under seven minutes, his average speed being some 196 kilometres per hour. The following year, in the midst of the season’s pitched duel against Britain’s James Hunt, he had a crash that set his Ferrari on fire and left burn scars on his face. \nDeemed too fast and dangerous, the Northern Loop was shortened in the early 1980s to just under 21 kilometres, and a Gran d Prix loop – the GPStrecke – of some five kilometres was added. By shortening the distance, the Grand Prix loop allows fans to see the racers more often than on the long track. It also helps cut fuel and maintenance costs. \nMore than 500 drivers in some 160 cars entered a recent spectacular 24-hour race on the long loop that winds around the foot of the ruins of a medieval castle, but only half of them crossed the finish line, a show of true endurance and determination. The track and the adjacent tiny town of Nuerburg offer many other attractions, dedicated to entire families: a museum of the circuit’s history with some celebrated cars and trucks, a carting track, race simulators and exhibitions and shops related to motor sports. \nSitting atop a hill, a stone tower of a medieval castle reveals a breathtaking panorama of the wooded mountains, the track centre and the town. \nIF YOU GO \nNuerburgring: Car-racing track in Nuerburg, Germany; nuerburgring.de .
