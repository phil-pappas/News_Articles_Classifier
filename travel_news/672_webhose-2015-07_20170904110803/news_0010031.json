Photograph by: Snelson Stock , Fotolia \nTime travelling through a series of extraordinary southern Alberta sites offers a glimpse into a nomadic culture that existed for millennia before the arrival of the outside world. \nThe buffalo-hunters of the western grasslands left little evidence of their 10,000 year-long occupation of the plains. Like the wind, they moved unencumbered. Southern Alberta has hundreds of ancient buffalo jumps – like the UNESCO World Heritage Site at Head-Smashed-In near Fort MacLeod – and the extraordinary, but singular, collection of petroglyphs at Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park outside Milk River. \nThere are also 50 surviving medicine wheels (large stone circles), including the Sundial Medicine Wheel , located on a hilltop east of Carmangay . To scientists and Aboriginals alike, the stone circles and the Milk River petroglyphs are mysteries – their purposes lost to time. Only the buffalo jumps have a function that’s understood. \nThe Sundial Medicine Wheel, situated on a remote butte near the Little Bow River, is the best preserved stone circle in Canada. The trick is finding it. The gravel road due east of Carmangay is long and dusty. Farms are few and the rolling plains endless, almost desolate. \nFor 23 kilometres, there are no clues to what lies ahead. There’s an X on the hand-drawn map I got from an Alberta archeologist, but where is the location of the X on the land? Off to the right, just before the road tips downhill into the Little Bow River valley, an unmarked, two-rut, dirt track winds through the grassland for a kilometre or two toward a high butte with an unusual nipple-like protuberance on top. It marks the centre of the Sundial Medicine Wheel. \nI ascend the hill and prairie wind riffles the slope’s bunchgrass. Directly in front of me, two near-parallel lines of low, lichen-covered stones jut from the hardened soil and mark a 15 metre-long ceremonial funnel toward a half-collapsed central cairn of boulders. \nMore curving lines of positioned stones lead away left and right – like the rings of a bull’seye. \nI follow the route around the 27-metre-diameter outer ring, then the 17-metre-diameter inner ring, trying to fathom what went on here. Research indicates the wheel – like all the others – has no apparent celestial purpose, no alignment to a particular compass direction. It’s possible that, as occurred at other medicine wheels, people once fixed a vertical wooden pole amid the central cairn’s boulders, whose shadow would sweep around the circles like a sundial. \nThe Blood, the Blackfoot, the Stoney, and the Piegan peoples passed this way centuries ago – just as the buffalo once did on their journey to near annihilation. From the butte’s crest today, there’s nothing visible in any direction except hundreds of square kilometres of grass that bends before the prairie winds. \nRock art Sometime during the last 3,000 years, nomadic buffalo-hunters arrived in the bizarre, hoodoofilled valley of southern Alberta’s Milk River and recognized a site suitable for ceremonial transformations. Using sharpened bones and antlers, they began writing on a seven-kilometre section of sandstone cliffs. Today, Writing-On-Stone Provincial Park, located 100 kilometres southeast of Lethbridge, contains the largest collection of Aboriginal rock art in North America. \nArcheologists say this is where the dead were brought. Local Piegan peoples, members of the Blackfoot Nation, believe it’s where their ancestors’ ghosts still reside. The bodies were trussed to the branches of the big cottonwoods lining the Milk River and lodged in the caves above. Nearer to the sky, it was said, the dead could see the distant Sweetgrass Hills, and – by going there – reach paradise. However, no one knows the meanings of the magical symbols, abstract patterns, and stylized human and animal scenes, carved by the thousands into the river’s nearby cliffs. \nEven the Piegan name the place in the past tense – Aysin ‘eep (“It has been written”). The petroglyphs existed before the Piegan came. \nThere are stick-men images, geometric shapes, dream-creatures, and modern graffiti – one reads ELVIS PRESLEY – inscribed on the rock. Here are centuries-old depictions of spirits with symbolic power-lines radiating from their heads. There are abstract shapes and curlicues; and warriors with thrusting, flag-draped spears. \nWhen the first horses appeared in the region in the 1720s, they were recorded in the petroglyphs bearing shield-carrying attackers who battle Blackfoot warriors on foot. Then there’s an intruder – a 19th century white man, no doubt, from the Abraham Lincoln-style top hat. There’s also a covered wagon and, ominously, a whisky bottle. The phantasmagoria of images flow together in a scrambled stone diary of those who came and left. \nThe wildly eroded cliffs take on, in the early evening, the appearance of skulls. The hoodoos assume the shapes of ancestral ghosts. Cottonwoods follow the valley’s meanders and through it a milk-coloured river runs, as spectral as bone. \nBuffalo jumps I first heard about buffalo jumps from the late archeologist Richard Forbis, who spent his life exposing the buried evidence of Aboriginal presence in southern Alberta. In 1957, Forbis heard that a flash flood had exposed thousands of bleached buffalo bones below a 15-metre sandstone bluff on Squaw Coulee near Cayley. \nHe soon learned that Blackfoot myths described the site as an old buffalo jump, one of hundreds of cliffs used by Aboriginals to drive herds of plains buffalo to their death. \nWorking downward with shovels, Forbis and his crew descended into the past. Some layers were full of bone, hair, and decomposing buffalo hide, others white with the ashes of burnt bone. Some contained exquisite, fluted and notched projectile points, rounded scrapers, and heavy choppers whose shapes indicated their age. By the time he and his team hit groundwater, Forbis had uncovered 2,000 years of continuous human usage of the buffalo jump. \nForbis soon learned of other such cliffs, including the now-famous UNESCO World Heritage Site at Head-Smashed-In , near Fort MacLeod and 75 kilometres south of his original dig. Today, the terrific, ultra-modern museum and outdoor trails at Head-Smashed-In make clear how – for 5,500 years – Aboriginal hunters utilized the sloping topography of the Porcupine Hills and the skills of buffalo runners, men tasked to propel the buffalo along well-established, cairn-lined drive lanes. The panicked animals, running at 50 km/h and oblivious to the precipice ahead, plunged headfirst over the 10 metre-high bluff there. In all, it’s estimated that 100,000 buffalo died at Head-Smashed-In. \nWalking the grassland above, the ingenuity and the co-operation required of the Aboriginals – without horses until the early 1700s – is apparent in such large-scale operations. The buffalo runners dressed as wolves to frighten and direct the stampeding herd. \nDozens more waited below the precipice to dispatch the fallen and injured buffalo, with others nearby ready to butcher the animals – meat, sinews, bones, and hides – so the people could survive a prairie winter. \n“I’d like to have a time machine,” Forbis told me wistfully of his life’s work, “and be able to go back and … and live with the people who were living then – hear their songs, hear their stories. What made them happy. What made them sad. But you can’t get that out of archeology. You can only catch the briefest glimpses of the tribes of the plains.” © Copyright (c) Postmedia Network Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T18:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T20:30:21.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
