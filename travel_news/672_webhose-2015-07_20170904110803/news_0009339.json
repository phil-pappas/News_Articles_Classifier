Airport cell phone service is important to everyone involved. \nMobile phones are essential travel tools. They're used for everything from voice calls to texting to popular travel tasks like making hotel reservations, finding ground transportation and much more. \nThat's why, twice each year, the experts at RootMetrics survey the quality of mobile phone connections and data speed at the 50 busiest airports in the U.S., as provided by AT&T ( T ) , Sprint ( S ) , T-Mobile ( TMUS ) and Verizon ( VZ ) . \nCovering the first half of 2015, the latest survey examines speed for uploads and downloads and considers the overall service quality travelers encounter. RootMetrics then ranks the 50 airports for cell phone service. \nCell phone coverage at New York City area airports ranks in the middle of the country's busy airports for service. Newark Liberty International (EWR) scored 13th and John F. Kennedy International (JFK) came in 21st, with T-Mobile the top provider in both locations. LaGuardia (LGA) placed 38th, with AT&T the top carrier there. \nHere are the top 10 U.S. airports on the new list: \nHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International (ATL) \nAtlanta's airport offers the best cell phone services in the country. \nAccording to the February, 2015 survey, AT&T provides was number one with a composite score of 99.7. Verizon was close behind with a rating of 99.1. T-Mobile was also near the top with a score of 98.4. Sprint trailed the pack with 91.5. \nWhen surveyed previously (September, 2014) the Atlanta airport saw Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T sharing the top honors. 1 of 10", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T19:27:38.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
