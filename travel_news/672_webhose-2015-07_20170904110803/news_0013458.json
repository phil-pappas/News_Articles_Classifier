Univision says in a statement the lawsuit is \"factually false and legally ridiculous.\"\nThe lawsuit claims breach of contract, defamation and speech violations. It says Univision cut ties with Miss Universe because Univision's owner supports Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton.\nUnivision says it will continue to fight Trump over derogatory comments he made June 16 about Mexican immigrants when he announced his run for the presidency.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-30T13:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T04:07:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
