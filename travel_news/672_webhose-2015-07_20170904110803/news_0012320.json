Yet in the longer term, the tragedy may underpin the popularity of the package holiday — the mainstay of Tui, which owns Thomson and First Choice, and its rival Thomas Cook. \nA concept that seemed outdated in the internet age, the package deal has been making a quiet comeback as a series of natural disasters, geopolitical upsets and macroeconomic worries has made consumers more aware of the benefits of a holiday where the tour operator bears the financial risk.Research for the ABTA, the industry trade association, shows that 51 per cent of consumers took a package holiday last year, up from 37 per cent in 2010. Just three in 10 went on self-organised holidays, down from a peak of 42 per cent in 2011. \nTour operators are legally responsible for their customers during the holiday, which involves looking after them in the event of natural or geopolitical crises. \nJohn Hays, founder of travel agency Hays Travel, recalled footing the bill for a family staying in a “very expensive suite” in the New York Waldorf Astoria when Hurricane Sandy struck the US eastern seaboard in 2012. “People see the benefit of packages in crisis situations,” he said. Tour operators are legally responsible for their customers during the holiday, which involves looking after them in the event of natural or geopolitical crises \nThe ash cloud spewed by Eyjafjallajökull, the Icelandic volcano, which shut down much of Europe’s airspace for six days in 2010, and the Egyptian revolution of 2011, when Foreign Office travel guidelines forced tour operators to evacuate their clients, also proved extremely expensive. Tui Travel, which merged with its German parent last year to form TUI Group, put the combined cost of the two incidents at £153m; for Thomas Cook the figure was £133m. \nThe Tunisian massacre is different because the Foreign Office has stopped short of declaring the country unsafe for travel. \nInstead it warned: “Further terrorist attacks are likely, including in tourist resorts, and by individuals unknown to the authorities, whose actions may be inspired by terrorist groups via social media. You should be especially vigilant at this time and follow the advice of Tunisian security authorities and your tour operator.” The political tensions in north Africa and Turkey have benefited the traditional sun-and-sand hotspots of the Iberian peninsula, where visitor numbers have continued to rise \nThe evacuations carried out by the two main tour operators from Tunisia since the terror attack have therefore been voluntary. \n“All travel companies massively focus on customer loyalty. Looking after them at times like these is absolutely critical,” said Alistair Pritchard, lead partner for travel at Deloitte. \nThe attack may also prove costly for Tunisia , which relies on tourist spending for about 15 per cent of its economy, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council. \n“I feel so sorry for the Tunisian government,” said Mr Hays. “It’s the one Arab Spring country that has embraced democracy and tried really hard.” \nThe political tensions in north Africa and Turkey have benefited the traditional sun-and-sand hotspots of the Iberian peninsula. Spain was already Britain’s most popular holiday destination in 2010, but visitor numbers have continued to rise, reaching 12.2m in 2014, according to official data. \nMr Long said growth was particularly strong this year for Tui’s resorts in the Balearic and Canary islands. “Families with children in particular don’t like the uncertainty. They go back to old favourites.” \nTUI shares fell 7 per cent to 1,034p on Monday but have since recovered 1.7 per cent to 1,052p. Thomas Cook shares fell 3.7 per cent to 139p on Monday and have continued to fall; they were trading at 132p on Friday.
