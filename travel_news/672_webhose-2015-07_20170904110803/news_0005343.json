You’re stuck at your desk and the day seems to be going on forever. Your mind starts to wander — at first to “anywhere but here,” but then to exotic, faraway lands where your everyday problems and stress melt in the presence of true paradise. You want to go to there, and we want to go with you. Every day at 3 p.m. Eastern, we’ll send you a picture of the place we at Yahoo Travel are daydreaming about so we can all take that mental vacation together.

Located in Olympic National Park, Rialto is a stunning beach known for its dark sand, piles of driftwood, tide pools, and striking seastacks. The many fans of Rialto rave on about its expansive beauty, saying it’s just as magical on a foggy, rainy day as it is when the sun is shining bright. No matter the weather or your outdoor inclinations, there’s a lot to see and do in and around Rialto. Between the beach and the adjacent forest, there are plenty of opportunities for picnicking, camping, hiking, swimming, and paddle boarding, just to name a few.
