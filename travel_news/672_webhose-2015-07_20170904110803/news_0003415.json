Resdar? Cafedar? Anyway, within seconds I can tell if a place is going to be good or bad. Sure, there are obvious signifiers: laminated menu, disengaged staff, those plastic banners outside, or an A-board quoting “The best steaks in town!” without bothering with tiresome attribution.\nBut some are more subtle: increasingly (and to my chagrin, because I shelled out for the originals 10 years ago), knock-off Tolix furniture . Anywhere that still uses Philippe Starck Louis Ghost chairs : brrr. “Brick” walls that are fake brick tiles. Over-long menus. “Medleys” of this and “nestling on beds” of that. Menus featuring the foods of too many counties. Outbreaks of boards and slates and jamjars. I could go on.\nLocation, too. I have a fondness for restaurants off any kind of beaten track, possibly formulated by my excitement when first led up the dingy, piss-fragranced alleyway to Hakkasan ’s opium den opulence. (Of course, it’s now just another overpriced, corporate-owned tosserama.)\nWithin seconds of entering Howard Street in Belfast, my resdar is saying, “Nope.” Despite being championed by Stephen Toman , chef at the city’s celebrated Ox , not much bodes well. The outdoor seating area, which is less pleasing alfresco space and more traffic-fumed smokers’ ghetto; the acres of brick, including the bar; the raucous noisiness. The menu galumphs around Thai tom yum, seafood hotpot, crispy chilli beef, throwing in dollops of Irishness – meat from Inch Abbey, Ewing’s smoked salmon, Fermanagh lamb – then forgetting again with French onion soup and gruyère croutons. There’s one wine on the list that, we’re told by the friendly, clued-up staff (and do read this in full Lady Bracknell tones ) comes from a box. A strong smell of frying hangs in the air. I’m meeting a restaurateur and writer of an unconventional cook book, and his first impressions are identical. I brace for yet another Not-London savaging. Oh, hooray.\nOf course, you know by now from the bloody spoilery ratings below that the food is great. Chef/owner Marty Murphy can cook, even if he is partial to a gallivant around the globe. And it’s considerably more sophisticated than the surroundings suggest: complex, intricate stuff, with multiple components realised in a thoughtful way that never teeters into overkill. Coconut soup with tom yum – wait a minute, isn’t tom yum already soup? Soup with soup? Anyway, it’s gorgeous – the sour, pungent, fragrant Thai flavours soothed by coconut, its depths thick with fat prawns, crisp Asian veg, spring onion. A slate bears little Irish goat’s cheese fritters, their richness tempered by little gem, slow-baked tomatoes, blobs of mustardy dressing and house-pickled vegetables. On a pretty rectangular celadon plate (sorry, I’m bemused by the myriad presentation styles) comes suave chicken liver parfait topped with a wafer of the bird’s crisped skin and with stewed grapes and hazelnut vinaigrette alongside: touches to transform an old warhorse into an intriguingly textured contemporary contender. These three dishes have an air of coming from different kitchens, but if they taste wonderful (and they do, who cares?\nHoward Street’s duck dish: ‘Every element works in blissful, quacking harmony.’ Photograph: Youcef Boubetnikh for the Guardian The daily special is a thick slab of hake. The skin is crisp, the flesh flaking languidly to the fork: perfect. A vivid fricassée of broad beans and peas with pancetta, plus potato and caramelised onion gratin, complete the line-up. I’m assuming from the fine flesh and juicy tenderness of my Cherry Valley duck that the name refers to the breed rather than its genesis at the vast duck “production” plant in Lincolnshire. It’s startlingly good: croquettes of duck with a little crunch, sour-sweetness from balsamic cherries, chargrilled spring onion, silky carrot puree and roasted weeny carrots, red wine jus. It sounds too much, but it so isn’t: every element works in blissful, quacking harmony. Cinnamon apple bread-and-butter pudding has the toffeed veneer of best crème brûlee, crackling through to a fruity, buttery squidge; there’s homemade honeycomb ice-cream, too, although I wish they’d called it Yellowman, local parlance for the Crunchie stuff, which always makes me hum, “ Sensimilla is irie. ”\nSo much for my instant critiquing ability. Even the noisiness turns out to be people having an excellent time. Howard Street has confounded my snap judgment and scrambled my resdar.
