Manathai Hotels & Resorts embraces 'Thainess' with opening of Surin Phuket Luxury Boutique Resort Leading luxury hospitality group MANATHAI Hotels & Resorts is preparing to offer travellers more insight into Thailand and Thainess when the latest in its unique collection of luxury boutique properties, MANATHAI Surin, Phuket opens on November 1, 2015. Located at the edge of the sophisticated and up-market Surin Beach on Phuket’s west coast, the 66-room boutique resort is only thirty minutes from Phuket International Airport and has easy access to a broad range of upscale restaurants and cafes as well as shopping and entertainment venues. MANATHAI Surin Phuket will be the fourth property of the independent Thai hospitality group, the other three situated in Hua Hin, Khao Lak and Koh Samui , as the group makes good its promise of unveiling four resorts in its first year of operations following its launch at World Travel Market in London late last year. \"We have moved ahead with purpose and remained true to our objectives of opening four resorts in 12 months, all in high quality beachfront locations and offering a uniqueness by embracing Thai culture and values,\" said MANATHAI Hotels & Resorts Chief Operations Officer, Christoph Berger. \"MANATHAI Surin Phuket compliments our vision perfectly, especially in the elegance of its design that presents a refined and contemporary interpretation of traditional Thai styles and service concepts, establishing a true sense of place for guests, and a quality and cultured experience.\" Thainess is found in particular in the way the resort is designed, with Thai textures, fabrics and flavours featured extensively in the resort’s modern facilities. Materials used include rattan and carved wooden Thai motifs, offset by vibrant local silks under the high ceilings of the public areas. Rooms will also be enriched by this approach with terracotta flooring and fashionable fabrics and hangings. In a very Thai touch, lotus ponds will grace the resorts’ pool and outer areas, which are enclosed by three-metre high hedges, creating a calm and naturally cloistered open space that ensures absolute privacy and a peaceful retreat-like ambiance. Cuisine features prominently in the experience for all guests. The pool bar offers light fare while signature restaurant Pad Thai features the iconic Thai dish and a range of other traditional Thai food cooked with authentic precision. Pad Thai serves breakfast before seguing into an all day dining restaurant in the day and a specialty Thai experience for dinner. Cooking classes are also available.
