Of course, summer spending can be something of a danger zone for consumers: half of Americans recently surveyed by Experian admitted they'd racked up credit card to cover their vacations. Some 68% of respondents used plastic to cover overnight accommodations and 67% did so to pay for air travel.\"Even though the economy is improving, everybody is looking to save money and get the most bang for their buck when they take that summer trip,\" said Matt Schulz, senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com. \"The right credit card can help you do that.\" That's why it's high time to start making the cards work for you. \"The interest in credit cards, as a whole, has increased as the economy has improved,\" said Schulz. \"People are spending more and banks are more willing to give out credit. It's actually a really good time to be out there looking for cards.\"According to Creditcards.com , these five credit cards may best suit your needs this summer. Best for Gas \nGas is the hot commodity for the Chase ( JPM - Get Report ) Freedom Card starting in July and lasting until September. Chase is offering 5% cash back on gas this month up to $1,500 on combined purchases. Each quarter, Chase announces additional categories and merchants that receive the 5% cash back reward. Next quarter, all of your Amazon ( AMZN - Get Report ) purchases will receive this perk. \"If you are someone who wants to keep track of those rotating categories and will remember to take advantage of them, then they can be a good deal,\" said Schulz. \"It's a matter of finding a card that is the best fit for you.\"Other notable benefits are the $100 bonus after spending $500 in your first three months, 0% APR for 15 months on purchases and balance transfers and 1% cash back on all purchases.\"If you're interested in traveling abroad, take into account the fact that this credit card has a 3% foreign transaction fee,\" said Jill Gonzalez, credit card expert at CardHub. 1 of 5", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T15:37:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
