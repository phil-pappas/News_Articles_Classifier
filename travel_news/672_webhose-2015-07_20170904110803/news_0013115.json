The new service is a triangular service starting from Hong Kong to Gold Coast, and continuing to Cairns enroute back to Hong Kong. Airbus A330 aircraft with 292 seats including 32 business class seats will be deployed on the route, operating on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. Hong Kong Airlines and Gold Coast Airport today held an agreement signing ceremony in Gold Coast.\nMr. Li Dianchun, Commercial Director of Hong Kong Airlines, said, “Hong Kong Airlines is delighted to announce this long-anticipated triangular service between Hong Kong and Australia. The route is designed to cater to the growing demand for tourism in Gold Coast and Cairns, both of which are popular destinations for leisure travel. Leveraging our connectivity in Asia via the international hub Hong Kong, we believe the new service will be well received by the passengers especially those from Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chengdu, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Okinawa, Bangkok and Taipei, bringing them more travel options.”\nMr. David Collins, Chief Operating Officer of Gold Coast Airport, said that the introduction of services from Hong Kong Airlines is a positive step forward in strengthening the Gold Coast’s partnership with the airline, and ultimately, the greater China market. “Our Business Development and Marketing team have been working with Hong Kong Airlines and distribution contacts in China for two years to bring this service to fruition. We are well aware of the demand for services between Gold Coast and China, and are confident this thrice-weekly service will perform strongly during the extended charter period.”\nAustralia has seen a steady rise of Hong Kong travellers visiting Australia in the past 6 years. According to the statistics of Tourism and Events Queensland, holiday makers contribute to 72.5% of Hong Kong visitors to Queensland in 2014. Total visitor count from Hong Kong to Queensland also rose notably by 15% year-on-year in the same period.\nThe flight schedule for the Gold Coast/ Cairns route is as follows:\nFlight no.
