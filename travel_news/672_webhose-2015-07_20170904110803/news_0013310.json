But how did the city develop such a reputation for producing hit musicals? \nVisitors to London staying in Kensington will be situated very close to the famous ‘Theatreland’ area – which is a veritable conglomeration of top-quality theatres and venues. Many world-famous dramas are staged there but the area is also very well-known for musicals, and particularly British musicals. \nIf you're staying in Kensington and plan to attend a few West End shows, you might find it interesting to learn where this association with big production musicals stems from. \nThe 1950s \nThe West End musical didn’t start in the 1950s; what is arguably the case, though, is that in the decades immediately preceding and then after the war, many musicals were either of U.S. origin or pale homespun imitations of the same. \nThere were some notable exceptions. The hit “Me and My Girl” was written in the 1930s and included timeless classics such as “The Sun Has Got His Hat On” and “The Lambeth Walk”. Noel Coward and Ivor Novello also produced musicals that were extremely popular in their day but, on the whole, up to and through most of the 1950s, American musicals were sweeping the board. At this time, they would have constituted the vast majority of the options available to people staying in Kensington hotels looking for a night out in the West End. All that was about to change though. \nThe 1960s and 1970s \nHistorians of music and even sociologists continue to argue about just what were the driving forces behind the explosion in British popular music that started in the earlier 1960s with groups such as the Beatles. \nSome say it was purely spontaneous, while others attribute it, to a degree at least, to the financial cushioning offered by the British social state, as opposed to the USA. Young musicians could survive and be ‘free to fail’ while they were struggling to make an impact. Yet other theorists say it was all to do with the huge imperative in the UK to throw off the austerity of the 1940s and 50s. \nWhatever the cause, by the late 1960s British popular music was dominating the global pop charts to an extent that was entirely disproportionate to population size and investment base. It seems likely that this was connected to the subsequent vast outpouring of British creative talent in the 1970s through 1990s in the field of musicals. \nAs the 1970s arrived, one name stands out above all others as part of this phenomenon - Andrew Lloyd Webber. \n1970s – \nAndrew Lloyd Webber began to make an immediate impression, and within the next 20 years he produced a series of now legendary hit musicals, the names of which have become part of folklore - including Jesus Christ Superstar, Evita, Cats, Starlight Express and The Phantom of the Opera. He wasn’t alone though. For example, The Rocky Horror Show was a low-budget musical written by English actor Richard O’ \nFor visitors to London, the great tradition of British musicals is almost a rite of passage.
