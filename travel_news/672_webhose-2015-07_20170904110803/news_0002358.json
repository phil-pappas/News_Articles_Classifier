The AAP government has claimed that they have made proper arrangements to tackle waterlogging issue across the national capital. “200 mm rains in last 36hrs. Govts continuous monitoring and intervention. Much less waterlogging than last years. We’ll keep improving,” Kejriwal tweeted. \nDelhi has been receiving heavy rains since Friday, causing waterlogging in different parts of the national capital. Traffic jams are also being reported from across the capital. PWD Minister Satyendar Jain on Friday released a 24X7 centralised helpline [1800118595] where residents can call and register their complaints about waterlogging. Releasing the helpline number, Jain had said water draining system cannot be improved immediately in the Capital but as soon as government would get information of any waterlogging a team would be sent to pump out water from the area. “There are many points which are prone to waterlogging. So to deal with it we are installing 150 mobile water pumps,” Jain had also said.
