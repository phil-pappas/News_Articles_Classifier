This could be the most famous rooftop in the world. Source: Supplied \nSOMETIMES when you’re a travel writer, the place you’re visiting just fails to connect. That was certainly how I was feeling during the early days of my recent adventure to Saigon. \nCertainly, this gleaming modern metropolis now known as Ho Chi Minh City offered plenty to see, with its grand Independence Palace, French colonial architecture, statue of Ho Chi Minh, the harrowing War Remnants Museum and the intriguing wartime Chu Chi Tunnels. All worthwhile, but the impact left me, to be blunt, underwhelmed. \nAnd then that all changed in one brief moment. It was a forgotten and faded part of the city that gave me an insight into its past, and connected me with the defining image of 1975’s fall of Saigon that had been burned into my memory from news stories of long ago. \nFour days into my visit, it was late one afternoon that I found myself standing on the rooftop of 22 Ly Tu Trong Street in Saigon’s District 1. A scene captured by Dutch photojournalist Hubert van Es in one of the most iconic and dramatic photographs from the Vietnam War unfolded on this very spot. \nThe famous photo showed a desperate line of South Vietnamese people clambering up a ladder to reach a US helicopter perched atop an apartment-building elevator shaft. It was taken on April 29, 1975 and showed the last chance of escape for these people before the Communist forces claimed the city one day later. \nDespite being only a small helicopter, the pilot managed to evacuate 15 people away to a new life.

This rooftop and the building are not on any tourist map, but remain one of the most famous places in Vietnam, if not one of the most famous rooftops in the world. \nI discovered the location days, before during a visit to the historic Post Office. Once outside, our tour guide quietly pointed to one block over the craggy old building with the nondescript elevator engine room at its peak that created an unusual silhouette against the glass wall of the new tower behind it. \n“That is where the famous helicopter evacuation by the Americans took place,” she confided. \n“People always think that picture was taken blocks away at the American embassy, but it happened here. The CIA were posted in that building during the war.” \nCould that be right? \nI quickly snapped a shot. Later in my hotel room and on my computer, it only took minutes to find the iconic van Es shot. When I put my new shot alongside the old picture, sure enough, it was the same rooftop. Some of the cladding had changed over the past 40 years, but the balcony area gave it’s past away. There it is ... Source: Supplied \nDays later, while wandering the city, I realised I was on Ly Tu Trong Street and actually walking right past number 22 with its famous rooftop. There are no signs, no historic plaques commemorating the role in history this building played. \nSeeing a driveway tunnel to its right side, I walked through to the courtyard at the back, which looked like little had changed since the 1970s. It was then I began to imagine the machinations of wartime these walls witnessed and the stories it could tell. \nIt was as I stared up at the rooftop that the man walked out of a doorway and approached me. He did not utter a word, but nodded and just beckoned me to follow him. \nHe walked inside the foyer and pressed the elevator button. As it arrived, he stepped in, pressed the top floor and gestured for me to enter as he stepped out. It was almost like he was eager to share with me the building’s forgotten history.

As I looked around, all I could think about was the chaos of those extraordinary hours in 1975, imagining ladders being placed against the walls by desperate people as the helicopter came down to land. \nThoughts of the distress of the people, their terror from the years of wartime and how they felt as they clung to ladders while wondering if they would make it onto the helicopter, and what life ahead would be like if they didn’t, hit me like a wave. \nI actually felt myself catch my breath. If it is true that you can feel the emotions of what has gone on in the past in some places, then this was indeed one of those places. \nFrom the rooftop, you can also see the expanding, boom city unfolding, and with the demand for space, there can’t be room for old, tired buildings like this for much longer. It is surely only a matter of time until it will give way to a new office tower, and history will be swept away by the bulldozers. And along with it, stories that are just too painful to recall from the very worst of times. There are still old ladders propped against it. Source: Supplied \nOn this rooftop, I finally found my connection with this conflicted city with its damaged and troubled past and its present where just about anything seems possible. But it also gave me a connection to the news stories and pictures I had grown up with in history books, and heard about in far greater, more vivid detail in the past few days during my museum visits. \nIt was then I heard the lift door open and the silent man stepped out. He just nodded and beckoned me back. I’d had my moment, but it was time to leave. This is not a place visitors are welcome, but he had made an exception. \nWe rode down in silence, but I found I did not want to speak, still too consumed with the insight into the past I had just experienced nine floors up. As I walked away from the building, I felt I had ‘got’ the city, at last. \nThe building and its history belong to Saigon, while the present belongs to the modern, frantic city of Ho Chi Minh, very busy with its eye keenly on the future. I also wondered for a moment if the building would still be standing in years to come on a future visit. I doubt it. The building on Ly Tu Trong Street.
