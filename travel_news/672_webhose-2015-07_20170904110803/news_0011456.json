A beer brewed with guava and mango and papaya and passionfruit from a strain of yeast known for imparting a Band-Aid aroma to wines.\nA happy, fruity, smelly beer does not scream schooner to me, but the Bossa Nova is no ordinary beer, and Garage Project no ordinary brewers.\nIn the Aro Valley, just outside downtown Wellington in, yes, a converted garage, for the past four years brothers Pete and Ian Gillespie and mate Jos Ruffell have been brewing iconoclastic beers that have won worldwide acclaim. What began as the ambitious 24 in 24 project — where they brewed a different beer each week for 24 weeks with kegs rolled out to the craft bars in town — has grown into an operation that includes a busy cellar door and distribution throughout New Zealand and now Australia.\nThe waterfront is alive in New Zealand’s capital city, Wellington. Source: Supplied\nAn aim “to make unique and beautiful beers” has resulted in such cult craft brews as the Hops on Pointe, a pilsner brewed with champagne yeast; the La Catrina, a blonde lager made with habanero chilli, watermelon and rose water, or the Pan Pacific amber ale which features golden syrup, toasted coconut and oats.\nThe thing that stuck me most while tasting the range at the cellar door — all while a steady stream of locals dropped in to chat and fill up their two-litre flagons to go from the draught taps — was that though the ingredients are eclectic and certainly eccentric, the beers are all surprisingly delicious and exceptionally well made. Even that fruity Bossa Nova won me over, the tropical fruits tempered with hops, the “brett” yeast adding just a hint of funky flavour.\nNext month, the brewery will create the Garage Project Milk Bar pop-up, where, in a homage to the corner store of yore — or dairy as they’re called in New Zealand — for four days a range of beers will be served that include a Cereal Milk stout, Ziggy’s Carrot Cake (brewed with carrots) and the Two Pot Flat White, a double coffee stout topped with a nitrogenated cream ale that has been wowing the bearded brigade at beer festivals around the world. These brews will be matched with pies from local bakers Dough Momma to create a genre-bending beer experience from a craft brewery at the top of its game.\nThe Garage Project in Wellington is changing the taste of beer to people’s delight. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nThis pop-up is just one of more than 130 events that make up Wellington on a Plate , a food festival that takes over the New Zealand capital for a fortnight in August. Now in its seventh year, the festival has grown into the country’s largest showcase of food, where individual ticketed events are complemented by dining experiences ranging from two-course set menus at the city’s best restaurants, through to burgers and beers.\nBurger Wellington is a now annual battle, where 80 eateries serve up their original take on a bun that’s then matched with a Garage Project beer (three of which will be brewed specially for the festival). At one of the capital’s favourite eateries, Boulcott Street Bistro , I was treated to a sneak peek of their tilt at the title: the Black and Gold, a paua (or as we know it, abalone) patty served in a karengo-seasoned bun (karengo is a wild NZ seaweed similar to Japanese nori). Served with local potato and kumura (sweet potato) crisps, it’s as delicious as it is decadent (an abalone burger!) for my Aussie tastes.\nHannahs Laneway Banquet, pictured last year, is a huge hit in New Zealand’s capital. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nThat abalone makes up just one of the three hero ingredients for the Intercontinental Hotel’s Delux Burger should indicate just how they intend to how to out-decadent decadence. The two-hour, three-course affair begins with a gold-flaked vodka martini (a single drip Elixir Absolut infused with lemon and lime) that’s matched with local crayfish and black truffle in a burger made from windmilled stoneground flour. It’s a burger of real beauty, generous with the lobster, heady with truffle, matched perfectly with the zesty martini.\nThat is then followed by a groper burger — the fish (also known as hapuka) beautifully cooked and pan-tanned, the bun with a hint of saffron — that’s served with a teaspoon of Beluga caviar on the side. Oh, and with glass of Krug champagne. As you do.\nStarting to feel a cross between a Lord of the Manor and Mr Creosote, the final burger of poached Wellington paua served with a Pernod-spiked hollandaise in a karengo bun almost pushes me over the edge, and I would stop eating if it weren’t so annoyingly delicious. It is extravagance writ largest, and at $350, the most expensive (by far) event on the program, but as a showcase of the best of the best local produce, it’s an experience as memorable as the bill is big.\nThe Intercontinental Hotel’s two-hour three-course Delux Burger. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nBut it’s not all about big ticket items. In fact, Wellington’s real charm lies in its laid-back big village atmosphere, where walking the CBD is effortless and where the food offering — from cool cafes to fine diners, secret bars and a world-class craft beer scene — is well out of proportion for a city of just 200,000.\nI get a real sense of the collegiality of the various operators here over my extended weekend visit, which at just a 3½ hour flight from our east coast capitals, makes for a very doable proposition.\n“It’s very much a plus-plus game,” says Rachel Taulelei, of local food company Yellow Brick Road , which supplies restaurants with local sustainably caught seafood. “What’s good for one operator is good for us all, and the industry as a whole is incredibly supportive.” Former lawyer Roman Jewell makes peanut butter in Hannah’s Laneway. Source: Supplied\nIt’s this support that fosters an atmosphere of innovation, collaboration and excellence evident throughout the city, nowhere more so than at Hannah’s Laneway. A buzzy strip of provedores, producers and purveyors of fine tastes, here you’ll find a handful of unique operators all focused on producing the best, whether it’s former lawyer turned peanut butter maker Roman Jewell , or Joseph Slater with his range of organic sodas at Six Barrel Soda . There’s a great craft beer bar — Golding’s Free Dive — where you can order pizzas to be delivered from Pizza Pomodoro (oft cited as the city’s best pizzas) which is across the way. Add a Fair Trade chocolate maker ( Wellington Chocolate Factory ), beaut bakery ( Leeds St bakery ) and a coffee roastery/cafe ( Red Rabbit Roastery ) and you have food lovers’ paradise all within a hundred metres.\nThat peanut butter is hands down the best I’ve tried. Look out for the small window where tastings of the four Fix and Fogg varieties — smooth, super crunchy, dark chocolate and the chilli/paprika-laced Smoke and Fire — are offered out of the working kitchen. The secret, apparently, is in peanuts that undergo a much darker, longer roast than is customary, but whatever the mechanics, all I know is that this jar of magic holds the answer to the best-ever toast breakfast (Smoke and Fire on sourdough, topped with fresh tomato and slices of avocado. Wow).\nIn fact, they are just the type of ingredients that could just find their way into a Garage Project beer. And you know what? I reckon they would make it taste delicious.\nGO2\nWELLINGTON\nWHAT’S ON\nWellington on a Plate runs Aug 14-30 at venues throughout the capital and surrounding areas.\nFor info and tickets, wellingtononaplate.com\nGETTING THERE\nAir New Zealand has direct flights daily from east coast capitals, see airnewzealand.com.au\nSTAYING THERE\nIn the heart of Wellington adjacent to the harbour waterfront, the InterContinental has 232 recently refurbished rooms and makes for an accessible base to explore the city.
