Events will be judged by an impartial panel of consumer event experts on specific event criteria and general areas such as demonstrated sound business practices, stability and exceptional customer service.\nNew for 2015: The Top Public Events program criteria will remain the same as year’s past, but the submission process will now be housed within IAEE’s Art of the Show Competition platform. IAEE has implemented a new, easy-to-use online system that streamlines the submission process. Public Event producers may also use this platform to enter as many as 15 categories in the IAEE Art of the Show Competition, which recognizes excellence in the development of promotional and marketing materials for any trade or consumer event.\n“The new online application system is more user-friendly and allows for greater exposure for public events,” says Public Events Council Chairperson Bob Morgan, General Manager, Dulles Expo Center. “It is a great opportunity to recognize the impact that public events have on the overall exhibitions and events industry. We are very excited about this year’s changes, and have reduced the fee for participating in both programs to give public event organizers an opportunity to fully explore them.”\nSource:- IAEE\nRelated Posts Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium IAEE Updates The Art of the Show Textbook IAEE Signs Agreements with Global Organizations to Expand Education and Membership Opportunities IAEE Now Accepting Applications for the 2014 Top Public Events IAEE and NACS Collaborate to Create New CEM Module and Program Specific to Consumer Exhibitions and Events", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T01:02:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
