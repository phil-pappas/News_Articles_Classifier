The Pharmabox Kiosk carries over 140 of the top selling merchandise typically found in a Target or Walgreens store, including cold and allergy medicines, stomach and digestive products, men's and women's personal health items, pediatric medicines, beverages, suntan lotions, contraceptives, batteries, and much more. It's like having a major retail store in a self-service automated kiosk, that can be located anywhere, and is available 24-hours a day. \"We are building out our plan for where to locate these wonderful systems, but we don't want to miss any areas where the demand for these products may be high, but the ease of purchasing is low,\" said Alejandro Rodriguez , Founder and CEO Pharmabox. \"Accordingly, we are accepting suggestions from the general public on where to locate a Pharmabox.\"Potential locations for the Pharmabox would include anywhere that people may need to pick up medicines, personal items, or beauty products, quickly and easily. This could be a high traffic location such as an airport, train or bus station; a university; a business center; or other area where it is not convenient to travel to a CVS, Target or similar store. Additionally, the Pharmabox would also be ideal for areas where people do not have access to convenient transportation, or there are simply no stores located nearby. \"Millions of people from every walk of life and every economic strata could benefit from having a Pharmabox somewhere near their work, home, or school,\" Rodriguez commented. \"We want to hear from them.\" 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T17:44:00.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
