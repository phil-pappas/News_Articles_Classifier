An eight-point safety check follows before we begin to pull ourselves around the 70m track inside the netted dome that is the zoo’s aviary.\nWe pass 8m above the first enclosure, where eastern grey kangaroos Martha and Daphne reside alongside four agile wallabies, before continuing to the crocodile enclosure, which we soar 12m above.\n“It’s the only installation of its kind in the world because it’s something we designed specifically for this purpose,” Merlin Entertainments’ general manager of Darling Harbour attractions Steve Hinks says.\n“It’s about putting guests in the environment of the animals and seeing the world from the perspective of our birdlife — a self-paced experience through the tree tops. Guests can interact with the birds in their environment and you’re looking at them at eye level while they’re flying.\nJournalist Angela Saurine takes to the air. Photo: Bob Barker.

It’s quite a lot of fun. I think the longer this is in place the more comfortable they will become.”\nChildren under 12 must be accompanied by an adult, with most people taking about 20 minutes to complete the activity.\nLauren Muddell, from West Ryde, and her 10-year-old daughter Mikayla were among the first to try the attraction.\n“It’s fun,” Mikayla says. “We saw lots of birds — budgies, lorikeets and finches. We could hear them screeching a lot. We could see the crocodile enclosure and see out to the water. I’d give it a score of 10 out of 10.”\nFollow Angela Saurine on Twitter: @angela_saurine\nWild Life Sydney, 1-5 Wheat Rd, Darling Harbour; entry adult $40, child 4-15 years $28, Wild Flight $15, 1800 206 158, wild-life.com.au\nRex the saltwater crocodile.
