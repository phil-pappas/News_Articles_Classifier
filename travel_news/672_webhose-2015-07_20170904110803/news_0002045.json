This article describes a day spent on a luxury safari staying at a good lodge or tented camp where game drives and activities, as well as meals and most drinks are typically included. A day on safari follows the general rhythm of the African bush and the wildlife that surrounds you. It is often tremendously exciting and relaxing at the same time. You don't have much control over what you are going to see, nor you can't just take off on a solitary walk, and there's no TV and often no Wifi -- but you won't miss any of that for a second. You can enjoy a safari whether you are young or old, fit or out of shape. You'll eat fantastic fresh food , homemade bread and cookies, sample delicious wines and be able to see the stars at night like you've never seen them before. For some, a safari is the only time they'll enjoy \"camping\" ... because it's really glamping. For those who camp more often, you'll love the feel of clean sheets and a comfy mattress while still getting the benefit of waking up to the sound of birds and hippos. Anouk Zijlma 1. 5:30 am -- Wake Up Call \nThis may not sound like much a vacation, but game drives start early because it's the best time to see the animals at their most active. Your wake up call is usually a gentle \"good morning\" from your guide followed by coffee, tea and a light breakfast. Anouk Zijlma 2. 6:00 am - 10:00am -- Morning Game Drive \nThis is what you're on safari for, the game drive. Make sure to wrap up warm if you are on safari between May - August, it can get chilly. Your guide will drive following tracks of animals you would like to see. Guides on different vehicles may radio each other if they spot something exciting like a hunt or kill. You'll generally stop after a couple of hours for some hot coffee, tea and light snacks. Game drives can take a little longer or shorter depending on what you find. Every drive is unique. Anouk Zijlma 3. 10:00 am - 11:00am -- Breakfast Time \nYou'll be pretty hungry at this point after a long game drive, which is good because breakfast is usually an all-English full fry up with bacon, sausages, eggs, fruit, yoghurt - the works. If your drinks are included don't forget to add a mimosa or bloody mary for fun. Sometimes you may be surprised with a \"bush breakfast\", but generally you'll be eating back at the lodge or camp. Anouk Zijlma 4. 11:00 am - 1:00pm -- Siesta \nFinally you get to enjoy your lovely tent or room and laze around the pool during the heat of the day. Often there's still plenty to see around camp as animals come up to enjoy the waterhole (if there is one close by) or occasionally drink from the swimming pool itself. This is my favorite time to do a little birding around camp. Most people use this time to have a nice nap. This is also the time that you can enjoy a short bush walk close to camp if your guide is available and you are staying on a private concession. 5. 1:00 pm - 2:00pm -- Lunch \nYes, it's time to eat AGAIN. Usually a light lunch is served, with lots of different salads and cold meats. If you are still napping, don't worry because tea is around the corner so you won't go hungry. Anouk Zijlma 6. 2:00 pm - 3:30 pm -- Siesta time again \nAnother period of rest before another chance to eat. Make the most of the pool if it's hot, or lie down for a while because even though you basically just sit during a game drive, the bouncing around, dust and excitement is very tiring. It's also nice to spend time chatting to the staff and fellow guests during this quiet period, so check out the communal areas of your camp or lodge. They usually have a good library, a comment book (always fun), bao , board games and cards. Anouk Zijlma 7. 3:30 pm - 4:00 pm -- Tea \nAh the British influence reigns supreme and tea is served along with lots of fresh baked goodies and tarts. This is where you really can't believe they can produce such fare in a \"bush kitchen\". Ice tea, coffee and other cool drinks are also usually served. Anouk Zijlma 8. 4:00 pm - 7:30 pm -- Game Drive \nThe afternoon game drive is my favorite, the light as the sun goes down is just magical. After a few hours of wildlife viewing your guide will usually stop somewhere scenic for \"sundowners\". This is where you really learn to love gin and tonics (or a cold beer) while watching the sunset and listening to hippos snort. Your guide will make sure it is safe to get out of the vehicle. In southern Africa do try the biltong and droewors you'll often get as snacks (I know, more food ...). If you are on a private concession your slow drive back to your lodge or camp will be in the dark. Your guide or tracker will hold up a spotlight and see if you can find cute bush babies, bat-eared foxes, leopard and other nocturnal animals. Anouk Zijlma 9. 7:30pm - 9:00pm -- Dinner \nDinner is usually a three course affair with lots of wine. Communal dining is popular at smaller, luxury camps and lodges. If you're on a romantic vacation you can certainly request (or have your safari consultant request) a private dinner either near your suite, or at a quiet spot away from other guests. If you are staying for three or more nights, you may get lucky and be treated to a boma dinner where traditional foods are served and guests sit around a fire. Often the staff will perform traditional song or dance. It's all very festive, and the stars put on a fantastic show on clear nights as well. Anouk Zijlma 10. 10:00pm -- Lights Out \nSafaris are social and it's really fun to meet people from all over the world, and enjoy good wine and stories around the campfire at night. But by 10 pm most people will likely be tucked away in their beds, after a guard escorts you to your suite/tent of course. It all starts again in a few hours ... and you can dream of even more exciting sightings as you fall asleep to the roar of a lion, and the bark of hyena.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T06:55:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
