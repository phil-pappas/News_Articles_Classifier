In addition, the initiative will help achieve sustainability standards by reducing the consumption of paper required for printing brochures, replacing them with interactive screens that provide much more detailed information and interactive experience. \nSCTDA stated that using ITS, tourists and visitors at Sharjah's major hotels will be able to access comprehensive content about Sharjah and its tourism facilities, services and attractions. ITS will also enable users to identify the cultural centres in the emirate and know more about its geographical nature and key locations. Speaking on the occasion, HE Khalid Jasim Al Midfa, Director General of SCTDA, said: \"Technology has today made it possible to enhance the tourism experience through increased connectivity. Sharjah Commerce and Tourism Development Authority is keen to make use of the latest technological advances as one of the key pillars of the Sharjah Tourism Vision 2021.\" \nHE Al Midfa pointed out that the latest technology allows visitors to plan their trips well in advance, enabling them to enjoy all the tourist destinations at their convenience. \"We believe that ITS will contribute further to establishing Sharjah as a leading tourism destination,\" HE Al Midfa added. ITS focuses on highlighting the identity and culture of Sharjah by providing easy access to information and promoting the diverse tourism products in the emirate. The initiative comes as a major step towards enhancing the quality of tourism in Sharjah and complements Sharjah's position as the 'Capital of Arab Tourism for 2015'.\nThe interactive touch screens provided by SCTDA offer information on universities and restaurants in Sharjah as well as details about the investment and business opportunities in the emirate. As an added advantage, ITS allows users to experience virtual tours of the emirate's landmarks. \nSCTDA recently launched Sharjah Tourism Vision 2021 by focusing on four main pillars - Ideal Family Tourism Destination, Innovative Tourism Approach, World Class Tourism Facilities and Capabilities, and International Cultural Hub - to strengthen the status of the emirate as a leading destination for family tourism. \n-Ends- \nAbout SCTDA Sharjah Commerce and Tourism Development Authority (SCTDA) was established in 1996 by Emiri Decree No. 5, with the objective of promoting commercial and tourism activities in the Emirate of Sharjah. \nSCTDA endeavours to develop these sectors through various events, activities and issuances, and promotes the emirate at all local, regional and international levels. \nConsequently, it carries out all the work and activities necessary to achieve their goals by way of planning and drawing up strategic plans to further development and to promote the tourism industry in all its forms.
