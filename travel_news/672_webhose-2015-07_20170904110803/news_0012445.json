It also sells a variety of business insurance.\nThe combined company plans to use the Chubb name and will have its main offices in Zurich, Switzerland, where Ace is based.\nChubb's Warren headquarters will contain a substantial portion of the headquarters function for the combined company's North American unit. Ace will keep a significant presence in Philadelphia, where its current North American division headquarters is based.\nChubb shareholders will receive $62.93 per share in cash and 0.6019 shares of Ace Ltd. stock. The price is a premium of about 30 percent over Chubb's Tuesday closing price of $95.14.\nChubb's stock jumped $25.62, or 27 percent, to $120.76 in New York Stock Exchange trading Wednesday.\nAce shareholders will own 70 percent of the combined business, with Chubb shareholders owning 30 percent.\nThe push to combine could be driven by weak insurance pricing, Citi analyst Todd Bault wrote in a note to investors.\n\"In that light, M&A is the natural historical play,\" he wrote, referring to mergers and acquisitions.\nAce Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Evan Greenberg will serve in those roles for the combined company. Chubb President and CEO John Finnegan will serve as executive vice chairman for external affairs of North America.\nGreenberg, 60, the son of former AIG CEO Maurice \"Hank\" Greenberg, has been expanding Ace through acquisitions around the world, gaining scale and diversifying risk, rather than focusing on share buybacks as Chubb had preferred. Ace has bought businesses in Brazil, Thailand and Mexico in recent years.\nThe company's board will expand to 18 from 14 members, with the addition of four independent directors from Chubb's current board.\nThe acquisition is anticipated to immediately add to earnings per share, with about $650 million in cost savings by the third year after closing.\nBoth companies' boards unanimously approved the transaction, which is targeted to close in the first quarter of 2016.\nThe deal still needs approval from Ace and Chubb shareholders.\nAce's stock rose 81 cents to $102.49 in New York Stock Exchange trading.\nThis article contains material from Bloomberg News.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T09:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T14:16:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
