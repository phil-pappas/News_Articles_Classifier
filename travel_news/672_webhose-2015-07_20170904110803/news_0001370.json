SAN FRANCISCO’S NEW NEIGHBORHOOD MUSEUM The new Tenderloin Museum in San Francisco, which opened late last week, aims to celebrate the still gritty neighborhood and its artists and activists with exhibitions, walking tours and evening events. A district once synonymous with vice, the Tenderloin offered a sanctuary for Asian refugees after the Vietnam War, incubated the gay and transgender movements and drew artists including the Grateful Dead, Miles Davis and Dashiell Hammett, subjects covered in the 3,200-square-foot museum’s permanent exhibition. In addition, the museum serves as a starting point for daily one-hour walking tours of the Tenderloin ($10) led by locals. Sites include the garages where Davis and the Dead recorded albums, single-room-occupancy hotels where Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray Robinson boxed, and sites key to the LGBT rights movement. A 90-minute evening tour will be offered on Thursdays for adults only ($20). “We’re trying to encourage understanding of the current Tenderloin by walking through the neighborhood and really making people feel connected,” said Randy Shaw, a board member at the museum. Upcoming events include film screenings, lectures and poetry readings.
