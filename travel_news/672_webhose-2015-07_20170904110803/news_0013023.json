The fire was reported on July 21 and led to the closure of an 18-mile section of the scenic Going-to-the-Sun Road.\nWinds caused some fire spotting on Thursday. Higher temperatures, wind and low humidity could lead to more flare-ups on Friday.\nFire officials gave media members a tour through the still-closed fire area on Thursday, noting improved views of St. Mary Lake through the burn area. Fire information officer Thomas Kimpton pointed out a waterfall that was newly visible.\nCrews expect the area will continue to burn until it snows.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T13:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T19:06:33.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
