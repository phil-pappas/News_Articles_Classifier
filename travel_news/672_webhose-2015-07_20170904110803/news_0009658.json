But, Cheapflights.com discovered, there are lots of other things you can rent, as well. Some may seem far-fetched but might actually be extremely useful to you on your next trip. While you might write them off at first, you may find yourself wondering, \"why didn't I think of that!?\" Close Top 10 weird and wonderful things you can rent of   Cheapflights begins its quest for quirky vacation rentals at the front of the line. Why waste your vacation time standing in line for show tickets, restaurants or anything else? Rent someone to do it for you. With companies like TaskRabbit and SameOleLineDudes, you can spend less time waiting and more time doing the things you want to do on your vacation. The price may vary by location, but SameOleLineDudes (located only in New York) charges $25 for the first hour and $10 for each additional hour. Image: See-ming Lee, waiting via Flickr CC BY-SA 2.0 A lot of us would agree that one of the best parts of traveling is showing off your amazing photos afterwards. But sometimes your pictures don’t turn out like you imagined. Or you’re not in a single photo because you were behind the camera the whole time (and aren’t a devotee of the selfie stick). Let Flytographer help. Flytographer connects local photographers in 150 different destinations with travelers to capture the best moments of their trip. You’re guaranteed great photos and your local photographer will be able to show you all the best (and, sometimes, least-known) picture-perfect spots. Image: epSos.de, Best Wedding Photographer Picture via Flickr CC BY 2.0 Does the idea of traveling solo not appeal to you? But none of your friends or family can travel when you can? Solve the problem by renting a friend. Rent a Friend allows you to hire a person to show you around a new town, teach you a new skill, introduce you to other people, go to a movie or restaurant with you and more. With a local by your side you’ll feel more comfortable in an unfamiliar place and, perhaps, make new lifelong friends. Image: Mike C, Silhouette via Flickr CC BY 2.0 Many of us have had to learn the hard way about roaming charges. A lot of people will go off the grid entirely when traveling to avoid fees while others will hop from café to café trying to access free WiFi. Solve the problem a different way by renting a phone. There are a few companies that offer this service, like OneSimCard and Cellular Abroad, and pricing varies, so be sure to do your research. Whether you opt for a daily fee or a pay-as-you-go plan, renting a phone may be a convenient and money-saving option. Image: Kenny Louie, iPhone again via Flickr CC BY 2.0 A camping trip is a great way to get away from it all and enjoy nature, but costs can add up. Before you know it, you’re spending just as much buying a tent, sleeping bag, first aid kit, burner stove, lantern, etc., as you would on a night in a 5-star hotel. Then, after your trip, you’re left with all this expensive equipment that you may only use once or twice a year. Avoid the cost and hassle by renting camping gear. Companies like Mountain Side Gear Rental or Rent a Tent Canada provide complete kits for one to four campers or let you pick and choose what you need separately. You can also connect with fellow campers on GearCommons, where you can rent what you need or, if you did buy your own gear, rent it to other campers and make some of that cash back. Image: Steven Cadman, Camping on Trannish Island via Flickr CC BY-SA 2.0 We get it. There is definitely an urge to go shopping before a vacation so you’ll have the cutest, most stylish accessories for your trip. But, between the cost of a trip and the cost of new accessories, you might find you’re a little over budget. What if we told you that you could tote that cute new bag on your travels without breaking the bank? Well, with Bag, Borrow or Steal, you can. Rent the latest designer bags for a month at a time for a fraction of the price. Want it longer than a month? No problem. You can rent the bag until you’re ready to send it back. Image: Maegan Tintari, lounge chairs+marc jacobs dress+louis vuitton bag via Flickr CC BY 2.0 Yes, you read that right. You can actually rent an island for your next vacation, and at a lower price than you might think. While there are islands that will cost you $50,000 a week, there are a few islands that are less than $3,000 a week, which could be a steal if you plan on splitting it with a large group. Each island is equipped with different levels of amenities, but they all offer the luxury of spending time on your own private island. Check out Rent My Island and Private Islands Online to see what little (or big) piece of paradise you can call your own, at least for a while. Image: Breezy Baldwin, Virgin Islands via Flickr CC BY 2.0 Finding a place to park can be a pain, especially if you are in a tourist-filled area. JustPark solves that problem by pairing up homeowners who aren’t using their driveways with people in need of a parking space. Whether you want a spot for a day or a week, it can be yours for less than what you’d pay a meter for the same amount of time. Image: Decorative Concrete Kingdom, Decorative Driveway Resurfacing - Fort Wayne via Flickr CC BY 2.0 As we mentioned earlier, one of the best parts of traveling is taking pictures and showing them off to your friends and family. And, while a smartphone camera is easy and convenient, sometimes it doesn’t do the moment justice. So, for trips where you know you’ll want a lot of great pictures, opt for renting a camera that will give you the best quality images. This is also a great way to test out cameras before you buy them. Borrow Lenses has a very large selection of cameras and video gear available for rent. You can browse their options, select rental duration and decide whether or not you’d like to use their rental insurance. In just a few days you’ll be ready to start snapping. Image: Alfie Ianni, My Canon EOS camera via Flickr CC BY 2.0 Although going on a trip is a lot of fun, too much time away from your furry friend may leave you feeling a bit deprived of puppy love. Fix that by renting a dog for the day. Walkzee (in beta test) allows you to search the area you are in for shelter dogs who need some human time. You can also contact local shelters on your own to see if they have any dog walking programs that allow outside visitors to walk their shelter dogs. Borrow My Doggy and Part time Pooch also allow you some puppy time while the dogs’ owners are at work or out of town themselves.
