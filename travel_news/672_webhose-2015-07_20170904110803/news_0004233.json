San Diego-based Balboa Travel , a leading TMC serving corporate clients in 93 countries, aggressively deployed TRIPBAM to help clients optimize their hotel programs. Balboa is already seeing noteworthy results on behalf of their clients. \nOne of TRIPBAM’s enhancements enables TMCs to use automation to easily identify commissions on published hotel rates that are better than non-commissionable rates. The ability to seek out commissionable rates, while simultaneously seeking lower rates at preferred properties, has cascading benefits for both the TMC and their corporate clients, particularly those clients who earn incremental revenue via hotel commissions. Balboa turned on this new functionality midway through the second quarter, and the resulting commissionable hotel bookings on published rates drove tens of thousands of dollars in newfound incremental revenue for their clients. \n“TRIPBAM’s commissionable rate detection feature on published hotel rates has the potential to be a truly impactful piece of hotel shopping technology for both agencies and corporations,” said John Cruse, chief operating officer of Balboa Travel. “In this climate, with hotel rates in North America consistently on the rise, this feature helps level the playing field for travel managers who are challenged to keep hotel costs in line.” \nSTR , the recognized authority on hotel industry trends, noted that the average daily rate (ADR) at U.S. hotels in May was up five percent year-over-year, with hoteliers seeing their revenue per available room (RevPAR) increase by nearly six percent. RevPAR has increased for 63 consecutive months – more than five years running – in the U.S. \nTRIPBAM uses patent-pending “cluster” shopping processes to find savings on more than 60 percent of hotel groups searched, with average savings of more than $100 per stay. Half of America’s top TMCs, as well as a growing number of the country’s 100 highest-travel-spending firms, are engaged with TRIPBAM today. TRIPBAM AUTOMATION SPURS MORE USE OF PREFERRED HOTELS \nBalboa also uses several other recent TRIPBAM enhancements, including: Enhanced hotel cluster functionality that only applies a cluster if the traveler is staying at a non-preferred hotel and creates clusters consisting of only preferred properties. This feature allows a corporation to improve traveler compliance with their preferred hotel program. A Last Search Option that searches for lower \"restricted\" rates at the traveler’s booked hotel in the 24 hours prior to check-in. This allows a corporate traveler to take advantage of distressed inventory situations saving even more money at the same hotel. Enhanced email templates that dramatically improve traveler acceptance of lower rate offers. These templates include maps showing the distance between hotels and placeholders for customized wording to allow a company to set the tone. \n“Balboa’s performance is indicative of the results we are seeing for all our clients,” said Steve Reynolds, founder and CEO of TRIPBAM. “With corporate hotel RFP season underway, and travel managers challenged by hoteliers driving rate increases, these features meet the twin goals of driving more use of preferred properties and saving money. Correspondingly, we are seeing more TMCs transition from pilots to broader TRIPBAM deployments as we move into the second half of the year.” \nAbout TRIPBAM™ \nDallas-based TRIPBAM is a new hotel shopping service used by corporations, hotels, travel agencies and travelers.
