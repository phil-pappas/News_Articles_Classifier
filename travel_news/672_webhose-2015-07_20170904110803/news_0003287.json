Will costs rise for those remaining in the UK?“Is there a crunch point where the whole thing becomes untenable?” \nHe also expressed concerns about the practicality of policing companies under the arrangements, adding: “How does the regulator know what business is being conducted in those countries? \n“Before this directive comes into force, some sort of network may develop between the regulators in different countries.”Mason argued that while customers could suffer as a result of the changes, by being unable to find an English speaker in the country where their company has gone bust, he believes the change was made in their interests. \n“If it is good for their [holiday companies’] business and cuts prices, then it could be considered good for customers too.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T19:22:28.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
