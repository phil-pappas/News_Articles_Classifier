Now,” he said with a dramatic pause. “I have a bottle of champagne to open.” If the literary world was abuzz when news emerged of a long lost Harper Lee novel , nowhere has excitement been greater than her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama . Finally - with a pop - Julia Stroud, who had waited four and a half hours for the honour, was let into the shop to collect the very first copy. \"I think it's very exciting for our county. It brings a lot of recognition to Monroe County,\" she said. \"To share the excitement with our friends and family - you can't get better than that.\" The first Harper Lee book holds a special place in American consciousness, dealing as it does with questions of race and justice in a small Southern town. The fictional town of Maycomb is modelled on Monroeville. Its courthouse, where Lee used to watch her lawyer father at work, was the model for the film version, which starred Gregory Peck. Many in the queue said the book launch was something very personal for the local population, many of whom knew Lee and her family, and had long been protective of the writer and her legacy. Harper Lee will publish her second novel, Go Set a Watchman, more than 50 years after the Pulitzer Prize-winning \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" .

Inside, they wrote notes that Mr Madrie promised would be delivered to Lee. He has ordered 11,000 copies with an option on a further 16,000 to satisfy demand. That means two per cent of all first editions are destined for his book shop in Monroeville. But while the new book is set in the mid Fifties, it hold parallels with modern America’s struggle with race and some difficult truths. According to early reviews, Finch is not the moral crusader of To Kill a Mockingbird, but a bigoted figure railing angrily against desegregation. Cerith Mathias, a scholar of southern literature who had travelled from Cardiff, said the character had taken on a life of its own, going far beyond the figure portrayed in the book in the American popular imagination. “I hope the new book inspires people to go back and read To Kill a Mockingbird a little more closely,” she said. “Atticus Finch was always working within the confines of the system.” Perhaps America and the people of Monroeville need Finch as their hero and as a way to deal with an uncomfortable past. All but a handful of the faces queuing for books on Monday night were white. The cover of Harper Lee's novel. Billy Ghee, county commissioner and one of the few blacks in the crowd, said Lee could write what she wanted but it would not change his view of Finch as a man who stood up for what was right in a deeply racist society. “You can do things but you still have to live in Monroeville,” he said, referring to the real town rather than the fictional Maycomb. “He went against the grain. He’s still my man.” He added, that it was the equivalent of taking down the Confederate flag – as South Carolina has recently under pressure from anti-racism campaigners: it may not be enough but it is a start. Quite what it all means for Eric Richardson, who strolled among the crowds in a linen suit and Panama hat, dressed as Gregory Peck playing Atticus Finch. He may no longer be in quite such demand from book clubs. \"You have to remember what Atticus Finch himself said, that to understand a person until you consider things from his point of view … until you climb into his skin and walk around in it,\" he said. \"And anyway, they'll still need someone to play him in the movie.\" Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T17:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T21:13:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
