Four members of the team died on the descent.\nThe solemn silence on the Matterhorn — underlined with the threat of a 5,000 Swiss francs ($5,290) fine — was part of a series of events marking the anniversary, which also included a light display along the route of the original ascent.\nAuthorities have also taken longer-term steps to calm the crush of mountaineers trying to reach the iconic 4,478-meter (14,692-foot) Alpine peak that Switzerland shares with neighboring Italy. The Hoernlihuette base camp refuge, also reopened Tuesday, has been reduced to 140 beds from 170.\nAn anniversary ascent by a team of climbers from Britain, France, Italy and Switzerland — reflecting the nationalities on the first ascent — is planned for Friday.\n< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 3 NEXT SLIDE > Authorities in Switzerland have declared the iconic Matterhorn mountain off-limits for a day on the 150th anniversary of the first ascent.
