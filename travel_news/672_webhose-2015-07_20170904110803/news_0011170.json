What a waste. A waste of tuition fees. A waste of time. A waste of opportunity. Of course students drink, they always have done. Back in the day, when parents were objects of fear and authority, drinking was a major reason to leave home. My tipple of choice during happy hour (four drinks at half price) was a triple vodka and orange poured into a pint of cider and blackcurrant. It looked revolting – like orange milk – so nobody nicked it while I shook my shoulders to Sisters of Mercy. It tasted pretty revolting, too, so I drank it slowly. It did the trick – and I still made it to my 9am Middle High German tutorials. Then again, my course at Edinburgh was nine to five and afforded few chances to fritter afternoons in the boozer. But here’s the thing: even if it had, I wouldn’t have gone. Firstly, because I couldn’t have afforded it; but, more saliently, because I had books to read and ideas to explore. I may not have paid fees or saddled myself with debt – I was one of the last tranche of students to receive a grant – but I was conscious of the need to make the most of the experience. Tertiary level education is supposed to instil the valuable virtues of self-motivation, independent study and reading round the subject. Yes, some courses are too sparsely timetabled, but simply opting out and going to the pub isn’t exactly the most productive response. I would hazard that students studying humanities courses who genuinely can’t think of anything better to do with their free time than get hammered probably shouldn’t be at university in the first place. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T12:53:01.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
