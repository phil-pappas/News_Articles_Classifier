The Riverdance Trinity College Dublin International summer school The Riverdance Trinity College Dublin International summer school Emma Jane Hade – 30 July 2015 09:24 AM\nBut Emily McFadden (13) is just one of the 290 budding dancers participating in the Riverdance International Summer School in Trinity College.\nThe American teenager, whose father hails from Donegal, has been dancing since she was five and made the long journey from Washington DC to participate in the Riverdance “crash course” in the Lir Academy.\n“I really love it. I started home-schooling this past year so I can have more time for dance,” the dedicated young woman said.\nRiverdance lead dancer Padraic Moyles was on hand to deliver directions to the 84 eager students on day three of this week’s workshop.\nThe three-week school teaches students – all aged between 12 and 30 – from 23 different countries. The three batches of students will be put through their paces under the watchful eye of the Riverdance troupe and will learn five key routines in a week.Some of the lucky participants may be selected to join the troupe on the road.\n“On week one, we took four of them and put them on stage in the Gaiety to dance in their first ever show. Last week it was two, this week it will be a number as well.\n“That’s what we do here, they learn the choreography and at the end of the week we put on a show here as well for all their parents,” he said.", "external_links": ["http://www.independent.ie/incoming/article31415020.ece/4ca48/ALTERNATES/h342/Riverdance3.jpg", "http://www.independent.ie/incoming/article31415022.ece/1226b/ALTERNATES/h342/Riverdance1.jpg", "http://www.independent.ie/incoming/article31415021.ece/15222/ALTERNATES/h342/Riverdance2.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-30T17:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:02:18.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
