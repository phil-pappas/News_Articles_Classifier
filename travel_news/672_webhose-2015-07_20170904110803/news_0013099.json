Source: AFP\nENGLAND pace ace James Anderson has been ruled out for the remainder of this Test match — and the fourth Test at Trent Bridge next week.\nAnderson badly strained his side while bowling late on day two and it is unknown whether he will bat if Australia pulls off a miracle and sets a target it’s able to defend today.\n“Obviously it’s going to be a big loss for them, but we’ve seen what Steven Finn can do,” Aussie batsman David Warner said.\n“Look what he did today, produced a fantastic spell. We know what Woody is capable of as well, so they’ve got bowling stocks.\n“For us, we’ve got to worry about scoring runs. What happens in their camp is in their camp.”\nJUST IN: James Anderson ruled out of the remainder of the third Test, as well as the fourth Test, due to a side strain #Ashes\n— cricket.com.au (@CricketAus) July 31, 2015 Stuart Broad tells Sky that Anderson will miss Trent Bridge but is very hopeful he'll be back for 5th #Ashes Test @surreycricket #Ashes2015\n— CricketBadger (@cricket_badger) July 31, 2015 The Aussies begin day three at 7/168 in their second innings with a lead of 23 runs. Peter Nevill (37 from 117 balls) and Mitchell Starc (7 from 29 balls) carry the hopes of the visitors.\nAnderson’s absence means Stuart Broad and Steven Finn will open the bowling today and look for the quick kill.\n— with News Corp’s Ben Horne\nDay 3 - Third Ashes Test (Frame content direct link: http://embed.scribblelive.com/Embed/v7.aspx?Id=1404372&ThemeId=27311 .)\nOriginally published as Live: Huge blow for England", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/australia-vs-england-third-test-day-three-at-edgbaston/story-fnu2penb-1227465353466", "http://embed.scribblelive.com/Embed/v7.aspx?Id=1404372&ThemeId=27311", "https://twitter.com/surreycricket", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ashes2015?src=hash", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/31/1227465/353438-64f503ca-3764-11e5-9208-acda9fc3b494.jpg", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ashes?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/cricket_badger/status/627055077908443136", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/31/1227465/392999-5c37d864-373e-11e5-abab-c01a58cce53e.jpg", "https://twitter.com/CricketAus/status/627044011153444865"], "published": "2015-08-01T03:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T13:36:51.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
