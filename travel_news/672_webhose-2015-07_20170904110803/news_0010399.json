Molinelli said detectives from his office's narcotics task force partnered with police in Dumont and Cresskill as well as officers from the Bergen County Sheriff's Office's K-9 Unit and the Bergen County Regional SWAT Team to raid a Stratford Avenue home on July 1. The residence had been under surveillance sparked by a tip to police.\nOnce inside the home, officers found marijuana packaged for sale, Molinelli said. Allegedly, there also were tabs of LSD inside the house along with codeine and promethazine syrup, digital scales, drug baggies and a heat sealer.\nMolinelli said officers detained the home's residents — 19-year-old Angel Nicasio and Mariana Tuero, 38 — and a New York City man, Ernest Daney, who is 32.\nAuthorities said marijuana also was seized from Tuero's bedroom and Daney’s vehicle, which was parked outside the residence.\nNicasio was charged with a single count of possession with the intent to distribute marijuana and possession with the intent to distribute LSD, with additional charges possible, Molinelli said. He was released from the Bergen County Jail after posting $75,000 bail.\nTuero and Daney were charged with possession of less than 50 grams of marijuana under 50 grams and were released on their own recognizance.\nEmail: harrisc@northjersey.com", "external_links": ["http://northjersey.mycapture.com/mycapture/lookup.asp?originalname=MC_Angel"], "published": "2015-07-08T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T04:37:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
