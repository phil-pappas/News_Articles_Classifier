Along the ruler-straight track, bordered by tundra that rolls towards snow-topped mountains, cars come to an abrupt halt.\nDoors are flung open and people jump out excitedly. 'Another bison jam,' says my guide, Anthony. The sight of buffalos nonchalantly crossing the road is a common one in these parts.\nAmerica's most famous protected wilderness - located in the north-west - has been luring visitors for thousands of years.\nA really wild show: Buffalo graze in Yellowstone National Park - which crosses the Idaho state line\nNative tribes first settled in this land of waterfalls and hot springs more than 11,000 years ago. These days, it's tourists, hikers and campers.\nThe vast majority of the park is in Wyoming, but a small slice (roughly one per cent) lies across the state border in Idaho, a place best known for its potatoes - a claim to fame that even features on its car registration plates.\nBut there is much more to this overlooked state than sensational spuds.\nInside the park, we drive along some of the 141 miles that circle Yellowstone Lake, keeping our eyes peeled for the wolves, elk and grizzlies that stalk the pine forests and snow-dusted peaks.\n A different side of San Francisco: Gazing at the Golden Gate... New York's playground: Mohonk Mountain's faux-Gothic... A wild sort of horseplay in the American West: Elegant... Beating the Vikings at their own game: A family cycling... The park's most sought-after sight - which sits firmly on the Wyoming side of the state line - is Old Faithful, a geyser that earned its name for its regular eruptions (roughly every 90 minutes).\nA large crowd gathers around and anticipation is high. 'Any minute now,' says the American woman behind me. 'Do they turn the geyser off at night?' asks her husband.\nMy loud scoff is drowned out as Old Faithful blows, shooting a plume of steam more than 100ft into the air.\nThe great outdoors is what Idaho does best.\nSlither on through: Idaho is home to dramatic waterways like the Snake River - which dissects Hell's Canyon\nRivers teeming with trout snake through valleys while woodlands are criss-crossed with mile after mile of walking and biking tracks.\nOne man who sings its praises louder than most is Jon Huntsman.\nThis self-made billionaire (he invented the egg box) has recently returned to his childhood state to launch his latest venture, Huntsman Springs - a sprawling estate in the blink-and-miss-it town of Driggs, 30 miles from Jackson Hole in Wyoming.\n'I grew up in a two-bedroom house with outdoor plumbing, but I always loved the majesty of the mountains and the tranquillity of the land,' he tells me.\n'It's the last remaining pristine place in America.'\nDotted around the landscaped property are mountain-style lodges of stone and wood, as rustic as they are grand, with antiques, hand-woven rugs and leather armchairs.\nEpic: Yellowstone National Park offers some of the most famous scenery west of the Mississippi\nElsewhere, there's an award-winning golf course, fly-fishing ponds and a spa. Plans are under way for a five-star hotel set to open in 2017.\nA large tract of the estate - around 500 acres - has been set aside as a nature reserve, with a two-mile boardwalk erected over the wetlands and ponds.\nWaiting beside one is John Pehrson, the resort's fly-fishing guru.\n'It's all in the flick of the wrist,' he tells me, as I haul a trout from the water.\nDriggs is an early-to-bed kind of town, but there's still fun to be had after dark.\nDinner at Forage, a quiet downtown restaurant, consists of roasted bison (with Idaho fries, naturally) and a glass of fruity Idaho Tempranillo.\nOut of town, hungry locals queue for spud buds (fried cubes of Idaho finest root vegetable) at the Spud Drive-In cinema, its entrance flanked by a model of a pick-up truck carrying a giant over-sized potato.\nPart of the furniture: John Huntsman (with wife Karen) owns the Huntsman Springs luxury lodge\nAll is quiet on Main Street. Cars pause momentarily at the town's only traffic light while those on foot pop into Big Hole Bakery for a quick bagel.\nOver a creamy huckleberry milkshake from the Corner Shop, I spy a notebook on the counter inviting shoppers to 'record their memories of the store'.\nNext to that sits a stack of local newspapers. 'Grizzlies spotted in South End' screams the headline.\nTucked away on page nine of the Teton Valley News is the Sheriff's Report, a weekly log of the 911 calls and how they were resolved.\nOne involved an alarmed woman, who reported a suspicious-looking man peering through her windows.\nInvestigating officers gleaned it was her estranged husband and, according to the Sheriff's Report, the couple 'were going to work out their differences by phone'.\nSurely it's nothing that a night at the Spud Drive-In and a plate of Idaho fries couldn't fix.\nTravel Facts: Plan your own long-distance adventure in Idaho Flights from Heathrow to Jackson Hole via Dallas with American Airlines (020 7660 2300, www.americanairlines.co.uk ) start at £660.\nA four-bedroom Mountain View Lodge at Huntsman Springs (001 208 313 5222, www.huntsmansprings.com ) costs from £290 per night.\nMore information on Idaho at www.visitidaho.org .\nRead more: American Airlines - Airline tickets and cheap flights at AA.com Huntsman Springs | Driggs Idaho Real Estate | Jackson Hole Real Estate www.visitidaho.org", "external_links": ["http://www.visitidaho.org/", "http://www.americanairlines.co.uk/", "http://www.huntsmansprings.com/", "http://dailym.ai/1LSAOVv"], "published": "2015-07-06T23:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T14:43:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
