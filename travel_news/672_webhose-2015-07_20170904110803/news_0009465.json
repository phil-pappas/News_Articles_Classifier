Supported with the newly introduced QA Marque, the association aims to establish a standard accreditation model to build recognition of the fast-growing industry. To qualify for the QA Marque, Oakwood Worldwide® was subjected to a rigorous review by independent ASAP assessors who also evaluated the overall customer experience provided by Oakwood Worldwide®. The QA marque was subsequently awarded to Oakwood Worldwide® as a result of their exceptionally high standard of service. “We are proud to participate in the ASAP programme and to have achieved the QA Marque with flying colours, underlining the hard work and dedication of our team,” said Debbie Lundon, managing director, EMEA at Oakwood Worldwide®. As we expand our offering in EMEA, we take great care to provide a superb standard of service for our guests, and it’s encouraging to see this is recognised by the industry.” We take great care to provide a superb standard of service as well maximum value for our guests.” ASAP Managing Director James Foice commented: “The success of global players like Oakwood Worldwide® is testament to the increasing profile of the serviced apartment industry internationally. After outstanding growth in our membership in the UK, Ireland and across Europe we are now very excited to be rolling out our quality accreditation in the USA this year, following a successful pilot scheme with key operators this spring. “The QA Marque has an important role to play in helping business travel buyers recognise the standard of quality and service they can expect from serviced apartment providers.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T18:36:22.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
