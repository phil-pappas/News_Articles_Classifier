A new 13-point scale will be introduced alongside the honours system to allow businesses to sift through increasing numbers of graduates with higher grades. A 300 per cent increase in the number of firsts awarded has been recorded since 1990, while seven out of every 10 graduates now takes away a first or 2:1 degree. Jo Johnson, the universities minister, said the current system was “no longer capable” of giving employers the information they need. Jo Johnson, Universities Minister He also warned that “benign forces are at work” after the Higher Education Academy found that nearly half of institutions had rigged their degree algorithms to ensure their students were “not disadvantaged compared to other institutions”. Mr Johnson said: “Students across the country have just finished their exams and are looking for good graduate jobs. The class of 2015 is more career-oriented than ever before. They rightly want hard work at university to be recognised and for their degree to be a currency that carries prestige and holds its value. “At the same time, businesses need a degree classification system that will help them identify the best applicants for their firms. Graduates achieving a First or 2:1 degree Year Graduates with First or 2:1 Mid-1990s 47 2009 63 2014 70 “The UK’s standard model of classes of honours is on its own no longer capable of providing the recognition hardworking students deserve and the information employers require.” A new US-style system was tested by 20 universities during a two-year government pilot and is deemed to better portray the gradient of student achievement. The new framework, which all universities will be expected to sign-up to by 2020, could also include a league table measuring quality of teaching. The amount graduates earn could be a key metric in the scoring of institutions. • UK degree system 'in need of overhaul' Higher education leaders have already expressed fears that they could be unfairly penalised under the system. Professor Paul O’Prey, vice-chancellor of Roehampton University, warned that his institution could score lower because 75 per cent of his students are women whose earning potential can be less than that of men. He said: “When I think about my own university and graduate earnings, 75 per cent of students are women and their graduate earnings over a lifetime will be affected. “Over half of our graduates go into teaching or other public services. They make a great contribution to society but they are not in the City. “Over half of our first years are from BME backgrounds and lower social economic groups who do not have the social platform to launch a graduate career in a fast way. It takes them much, much longer to get established. “I wonder how this is going to affect a university like mine.” Mr Johnson also refused to rule out an increase in tuition fees for a second time, insisting that he wanted to achieve “value for money” for both students and taxpayers. Sally Hunt, the University and College Union general secretary, said: “Experts have highlighted the dire problems with the current system. “We need a system where universities receive stable public funding, staff are properly rewarded and secure in their jobs, and students are not deterred from study by rising levels of debt.” Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T17:50:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
