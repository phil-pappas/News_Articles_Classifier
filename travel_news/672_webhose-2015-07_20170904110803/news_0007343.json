He wants to transform the southernmost city of Guangdong province into an economic powerhouse that can rival cities such as Foshan and Dongguan. He has successfully courted a number of state-owned petrochemical, steel and papermaking giants to the city. But Wang’s vision also encompasses the environmental and social implications of development as he wants to turn Zhanjiang into an eco-city, he tells Zhao Huanxin in this Q&A session. After two years of construction, Baosteel’s massive steel and iron plant in Zhanjiang begins trial operations in September, at a time when the industry is beset by overcapacity and there are growing concerns about the industry’s impact on the environment. How will it overcome these headwinds? It must be noted that the new plant, with an annual output capacity of 10 million tonnes of top-quality steel, has been accompanied by the phasing out of 16.1 million tonnes of obsolete capacity in steel production in all of Guangdong province. As the strategic upgrade of the Baosteel Group’s 30-year-old, Shanghaibased plant, the Zhanjiang plant is endowed with an unrivaled logistics advantages, namely the deepwater Zhanjiang Port that makes the transport of iron ores from Australia and Brazil and exports of finished products to southern China, Southeast Asia and beyond more cost-effective than almost anywhere on the mainland. Meanwhile, there has been a massive investment to make the steel plant as environmentally friendly as possible. Based on the current budget, for each tonne of steel produced, at least 700 yuan (£72) is being spent to minimise the discharge of pollutants. We have also made breakthroughs that turn the waste and other byproducts from either the steelmaking or petrochemical plants — which are 500 metres apart on Donghai Island — into the raw materials and energy for the other. We call that the circular economy. I have confidence in this state-owned steel company. I’m sure people will still be able to relish seafood worry-free after these modern industrial complexes go into full operation in Zhanjiang. You were a blast-furnace man 30 years ago, shoveling raw materials into the furnace for two years. Last week, you pushed a button to start the trial operations of the plant’s converter. How have things changed over the years? There has certainly been a sea change in China’s manufacturing sector over the past three decades. Still, I miss the days when I enjoyed the cool evenings with my co-workers beside a simple fan after sweating for a whole day by the blast furnace. Slightly more than a century ago, the French occupied Zhanjiang Port, which was then a minor fishing port. It was returned to China in the late 1940s. How has the port developed and what are its prospects? Zhanjiang Port as we see it now was one of the first key projects undertaken during China’s first Five-Year Plan (1953-57). It is China’s first, self-designed modern port. Before the 1980s, it was used for exports of materials to support countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, and for imports from a limited number of countries such as Poland. It took the port 18 years to increase its cargo throughput from 10 million tonnes to 100 million, and then six years to increase the throughput to 200 million tonnes. You can imagine its prospects now that the country has launched its Belt and Road Initiative In a few years, we anticipate the throughput capacity at Zhanjiang Port will expand to 300 million tonnes, and the port channels will be expanded so vessels of 400,000 tonnes can berth. At present, the maximum is 300,000 tonnes. The port boasts the shortest route from the Chinese mainland to Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe and Oceania. You can imagine its prospects now that the country has launched its Belt and Road Initiative, a trade and infrastructure network that will connect Asia, Europe and Africa. Exports of seafood to European and American markets used to exceed 1 million tonnes a year. Exports are now declining. How will Zhanjiang respond? Shrimp exports to the United States dropped in the first half of this year, and so it is with other seafoods to other countries. Actually, we are attaching equal importance to developing the domestic market, which is huge. Last year, Zhanjiang hosted a national aquatic product fair and such events will be held in the city annually to boost consumption. You envision Zhanjiang having a “slow traffic lane of 300 kilometres” to support the “Footprint City” action plan. But we seem to have all embarked on a fast-track way of life. It all boils down to cultivating a way of living, whether you want to have your life dependent on polluting private autos or cutting your carbon footprint by using more public transport, bicycles or simply by walking. Here is where the government should play a guiding role. Countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia and Finland have facilities and designs that make pedestrians and cyclists fare well in cities. For Zhanjiang, we don’t necessarily have to build new roads for pedestrians and cyclists, we just need to reallocate the rights to use the roads, such as reserving lanes for walkers and bicycles and even for e-bikes. We anticipate the ratio of lanes designated to pedestrians and cyclists will take up 40 per cent of the roads in Zhanjiang. By then we can call it a modest “footprint city”. You mentioned Russia, Finland and Germany, and you seem to have visited them a lot in recent years. What have you learned during your visits? Like many Chinese officials, I used to pay a lot of attention to industrial development when I travelled abroad. But now I focus on social development, like why there are so many smiling faces in every city I visit. How have the culture and environment been protected in these developed countries amid their economic booms? You actually become more modest and humble after you communicate with other people... In Odense, the third-largest city in Denmark, places for residents to park their bicycles can be seen everywhere, many households have at least two bicycles for different purposes. There are a lot of things that Zhanjiang could do in the same way. You are a fluent English speaker. Does this help sharpen your vision and expand your horizons? You actually become more modest and humble after you communicate with and get to know the insights of other peoples and immerse yourself in different cultures. You become more open-minded, open to different views, to criticism. As a mayor, I know I am not the best, but in everything I do, I do my best. What they say... Before I came, I thought the city would be less developed because it is located close to China’s southern end. Seafood here is fresh and cheap, and the service is good, too.” Zou Ming, chief editor of Phoenix New Media “Zhanjiang feels like a resort city. I was amazed by its tidiness. It’s even prettier than Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Zhanjiang should let more people know about its beauty.” Yang Gu, CEO and chief editor of mw.cn, the online platform of Guangming Daily “I’m confident that Zhanjiang, which used to be a starting point on the ancient maritime Silk Road, will achieve faster growth under the country’s Belt and Road Initiative.” Xing Yujun, editorial board member of dzwww.com, a major news portal in Shandong province “Ecology is Zhanjiang’s best ‘name card’. I’m impressed by its beautiful sea and blue sky. The city is marching into modernisation while taking good care of the environment.” Song Nanjian, director of the information centre of Northeast Online READ MORE: • Web companies asked to support 'digital Silk Road' • Risks growing for cyber security • A traditional art form takes off as economic lifeline for Chinese town This article was originally produced and published by China Daily . • Read more about Chinese society at China Watch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T07:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T07:13:37.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
