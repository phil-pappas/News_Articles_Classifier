The challenger bank received the first part of its banking licence at the start of the year, and hopes to gain full approval to start trading over the summer. Mr Ardalan was previously vice-chairman of public policy and government relations at Barclays, and believes the experience dealing with regulators will help in his role at the new bank. “There has been a pretty dramatic change in the regulatory environment, and small banks are subject to just the same regulations as the big banks,” Mr Ardalan said on Monday. OakNorth hopes to start trading later this summer The new chairman replaces Ratan Engineer, a former Ernst & Young executive who died in April. OakNorth’s board also includes Lord Adair Turner , the former chief of the Financial Services Authority. The bank wants to focus on entrepreneurs and growth businesses, which Mr Ardalan argued were poorly served by existing banks. He said that the bank aimed to offer services such as cash flow finance, which are needed by rapidly-growing firms, as well as the more traditional small business products such as asset finance. Mr Ardalan hopes the bank will be quicker and more nimble than the big banks, and be better value than the peer-to-peer lenders that have sprung up to offer alternative sources of loans to small businesses. He added that he expected OakNorth to grow to a respectable but manageable size within the niche of enterprise finance. “As share of the banking market, we don’t necessarily see growth to more than a few percent. But that would take you into a few billion in assets over five to seven years. You don’t have to be very large to have a very viable, effective institution,” he said. George Osborne introduced a new bank tax in the Budget The likely launch of the bank onto the market comes just after Chancellor George Osborne increased taxes on smaller banks, pledging to gradually reduce the impact of the bank levy on the giant banks , while implementing a new 8pc tax on profits on top of corporation tax, for banks with profits of above £25m per year. Other challenger banks have complained at the move , but Mr Ardalan is hopeful that any significant damage could be reversed in future. “If I look at the track record of the government, it has tended to be very pragmatic,” he said. “If the changes result in a negative impact on the sector, I am sure the government will look at it, as they have done with levy.” Follow the Telegraph on LinkedIn.
