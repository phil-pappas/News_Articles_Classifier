Parade him not his brother,” the actor had tweeted. Tiger Memon, who is believed to be in Pakistan, is one of the prime suspects in the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts that killed 257 people and injured 1,400.\nSalman Khan said he had been wanting to tweet about the issue for some days but was afraid.\n“Been wanting to tweet Tis fr 3 days n was afraid to do so but it involves a man’s n family. Don’t hang brother hang tha lomdi (fox) who ran away,” he tweeted.\n“1 innocent man killed is killing the humanity,” Salman Khan tweeted.\nAs his tweets sparked a furore and were dubbed as “objectionable” and also led to protests by BJP workers outside Salman Khan’s residence in suburban Bandra, BJP and ally Shiv Sena demanded cancellation of the actor’s bail in the 2002 hit-and-run case. A Shiv Sena spokesperson Manisha Kayande even called Khan anti-national.\nUjjwal Nikam, the special prosecutor in the 1993 Mumbai blasts case, took a strong exception to Salman Khan’s tweets in defence of Yakub Memon, and said the actor must withdraw them.\nNikam said, “Tweets made by Salman Khan are highly objectionable” and were an attempt to “undermine the image of the Indian Judiciary.”\nTADA Judge P D Kode who sent Yakub Memon to the gallows, said Salman Khan’s tweets are his ‘opinion’ and that everyone has a right to his or her opinion as a right to freedom of speech but the question is how “relevant” it is.\nDeleting his earlier tweets, Salman Khan said that his father Salim Khan called him and said he should retract his tweets as they had the potential to create “misunderstanding”.\nSalim, a veteran Bollywood scriptwriter, is Quote: d as having said that his son is “ignorant” of the issue and people should not take him seriously, describing the star’s earlier remarks as ridiculous and meaningless.\n“My dad called & said I should retract my tweets as they have the potential to create misunderstanding. I hereby retract them.\nI would like to unconditionally apologise for any misunderstanding I may have created unintentionally,” he said in a series of tweets in the evening.\nSalman Khan said he also strongly condemned those who are claiming his tweets are “anti-religious”, adding, “I have always said I respect all faiths and I always will.”\n“I had tweeted that Tiger Memon should hang for his crimes and I stand by it. What i also said is that Yakub Memon should not hang for him. I have not said or implied that Yakub Memon is innocent. I have complete faith in the judicial system of our country.\n“Many lives were lost in the Mumbai blasts. And I have repeatedly said the loss of one innocent life is equal to the loss of all humanity,” he said.\nSalman Khan, who has 13.1 million followers on Twitter, also asked Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to send Tiger (Memon) to India if he was in his country.\n“Sharif Saab ek darkhaust hai k agar yeh aap k mulkh mein hai toh plz iktila kar deejiyeh.

No one is above the law of the country. The case has been going on in various courts of law for last 20 years.”\nCongress said the Supreme Court verdict should be respected and all must “follow the course of the law”\nSalman Khan’s friend and Congress leader Milind Deora tried to do some damage control. He tweeted that he had spoken to the actor last night and today and Salman Khan “doesn’t believe Yakub Memon isn’t guilty & was only spotlighting YM’s brother’s cowardice.”\nSenior advocate Abha Singh criticised Khan for his remark on Yakub saying the actor’s statement is against the rule of law.\nCriticising Salman Khan, a twitterati said, “Salman KHan is a Double Convicted Person..He should have confined to his Home..OK he has no shame…”\nHowever, the social media had some tweets coming out in support of Salman Khan’s remarks on Yakub.\nShatrughan Sinha, actor and BJP MP, said, “Agar usne aisa kaha hai to aap uski bhaavnayon ko samajhiye (If he (Salman) has said so, then you must understand his feelings).”\n 26, 2015 5:55 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T22:35:50.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
