Subscribe now to 3 photos Chef John Rivers pulls a brisket from the smoker in the kitchen at 4 Rivers Smokehouse… more It took Chef John Rivers 18 years to perfect the 18 hours needed to smoke an amazing brisket. In fact, the owner of Winter Park-based 4R Restaurant Group used to sleep in a hammock by the smoker to make sure the temperature stayed consistent. “That dang brisket didn’t come together until 2008. That’s when it wasn’t just good — it was exceptional.” He admits his passion for barbecue turned into an infatuation, and he’s not alone. A growing number of barbecue restaurants are popping up in Orlando, and many small family barbecue businesses are building strong reputations to stand out from the large locally based chains like Sonny’s BBQ and Smokey Bones. Customers don’t mind lining… more Home of the Day See All Homes of the Day They’re all part of the emerging local barbecue scene, which may not contribute as much to Orlando’s economy as tourism — but if the two industries worked together, barbecue could mean even bigger business for the region. And that’s just part of the secret to the sauce. Orlando’s barbecue reputation also needs a dash of branding and a handful of marketing. Several key players in the city’s barbecue industry have been featured in national publications, including USA Today , which helps spread the word that Orlando is a burgeoning barbecue destination. And the eyes of many food enthusiasts will be on Central Florida in November as Kissimmee hosts the World Food Championships, which is expected to bring up to 10,000 people per day during the six-day event that includes a barbecue competition. “The more competitions and events that focus on and feature barbecue in Central Florida, the more it will make it a barbecue destination, which will lead to more desire and more restaurants,” said Mike McCloud , president and CEO of World Food Championships. So what else will it take to put Orlando on the map for barbecue? Here, local chefs, tourism executives and barbecue experts, share their recipe for making the city’s barbecue reputation a smoking success. Finding Orlando’s smoking style For Michael Reaves , owner of Cecil’s Texas Style Bar-B-Q, cooking barbecue isn’t work, it’s a way of life. He grew up in Texas where there’s a mom-and-pop barbecue joint on every corner. Now he’s continuing what his father, Cecil, started in Orlando more than 20 years ago: a family barbecue business with recipes passed down for generations. “Teaching people barbecue isn’t easy. It’s not normal cooking. I don’t use a thermometer — I use a fork and go by the eye, feel and touch. It takes talent.” He and others also may have the talent needed to bring attention to Orlando’s barbecue scene. For example, Cecil’s is known for its Texas-style barbecue, and other local restaurants have brought flavor and sauce profiles from barbecue hot spots like Memphis, Tenn.; Kansas City, Mo.; and the Carolinas to the region as well, making Orlando stand out as a melting pot for barbecue — something that could be used as a tool to market the region as a barbecue destination. “Here, now you’re getting more blending of the styles all together,” Reaves said. “Bubbalou’s does Carolina style, we do Texas, Sonny’s has southern Florida barbecue. You have everything here.” In addition, unique flavors have emerged in Central Florida. For instance, Pig Floyd’s Urban Barbakoa in the Mills 50 district near downtown Orlando has brought both Puerto Rican and Asian flavor profiles to the city’s barbecue scene. The menu offers tacos, and black beans and rice, while the ribs have an Asian flavor. Restaurants that introduce new flavor profiles to Orlando help redefine its barbecue style and build the city’s barbecue brand, said Darren Tristano , vice president of food industry research firm Technomic Inc. “Ultimately, it can be contemporized and built for a new generation versus the older barbecue that’s geared toward a lower income and lower-quality meats. It can be brought more upscale with new flavor profiles.” And while Orlando still may be searching for its barbecue style, some local chefs say that isn’t necessarily a bad thing when building the city’s barbecue brand. “It’s an advantage for consumers not to have one style,” Rivers said. “It’s good to have traditional and some with a unique flair. We’re all cooking it the same way with a closed smoking system for the most part, and that’s going to produce some consistency, but the differentiator is the type of wood, temperature and seasoning.” So how will Orlando become a barbecue destination without a distinct flavor? The answer may be found in the city’s 62 million annual visitors. “I’m not sure Orlando has a unique barbecue flavor or profile. However, it is a unique destination,” McCloud said. “What Orlando has going for it is it’s so good at marketing to and welcoming tourists. So if they can carve out a barbecue niche different than the Carolinas’ mustard vinegar-based sauce, Tennessee’s pork, Kansas City’s sweet and tangy, and Texas’s brisket, then it’d be a perfect addition to the community known for welcoming tourists.” Tapping into tourism In fact, some local barbecue restaurants already are popular with out-of-towners. For example, if you walk into the Winter Park and Winter Garden locations of 4 Rivers Smokehouse on Fridays and Saturdays, the restaurants not only will be filled with locals, but also a healthy helping of tourists. Rivers said he’s had people come in straight from Switzerland without even going to their hotel first. And once a group from China came in, didn’t speak any English and had everything from the menu spread out on their table. “We’re finding more of the tourists going online to see who people are talking about or to find the local staples or something that’s new and rising,” Rivers said. While Orlando does not yet have a distinct barbecue style that draws people to the region, teaming up with area attractions and local municipal tourism boards and the region’s visitors bureaus can help the city become a bigger barbecue destination. For example, Reaves said getting hooked into Walt Disney World or even SeaWorld’s Band Brew & BBQ event could help get local barbecue restaurants’ names out to visitors. Meanwhile, Thomas Ward , owner of Pig Floyd’s Urban Barbakoa, said he’d love to have an airport location to tap into the region’s tourists, too. And, as further evidence of Orlando’s growing foodie cred, Experience Kissimmee lured the fourth annual World Food Championships to Central Florida. The six-day event — referred to as the Olympics of food and the largest food tournament in the world — previously was held in Las Vegas for three years. “Kissimmee has an open-ended annual renewal option on the event right now,” McCloud said. “We very well could be there for the next 10-20 years as long as things go well and we have enough room to expand. We’d like to be there long term.” Central Florida Hotel & Lodging Association President Rich Maladecki said the World Food Championships is another example of how well Orlando understands all elements of tourism promotion. He added that he can see the area becoming known as a foodie destination. “It starts with having good food, and if barbecue restaurants in town are coordinating competitions, it leads to the best of the best,” Maladecki said. “If it leads to an opportunity for a barbecue food festival, I would look for the tourism industry to help build that brand. Food is very family-oriented, and we’re the top family destination of the world.” Building the brand Meanwhile, Ward has some ideas about opening the eyes of barbecue enthusiasts to realize Orlando can become a barbecue destination. Ward’s journey with barbecue began on Thanksgiving just two years ago. Thanks to instructions from a YouTube video, Ward successfully smoked a turkey — even though his mother brought a back-up turkey just in case. From there, Ward said he breathed barbecue, opening Pig Floyd’s Urban Barbakoa in late 2014. And he credits YouTube videos from brisket master Aaron Franklin of Austin-based Franklin Barbecue and his PBS show BBQ With Franklin for opening his eyes to barbecue even more. Ward believes that type of TV exposure is a surefire way to bring even more attention to the local scene. “If my quality is superb, my concept is different and I can get a TV show from the Food Network to do something cool about it, that would create a buzz and bring more people to the scene.” Further, Ward’s story is a good example of how Orlando can learn from major traditional barbecue destinations and then put a modern twist on its growing barbecue brand to build up the local scene — such as the idea of promoting it as a melting pot of styles. In addition, Ward said camaraderie among barbecue industry chefs would help promote the region’s offerings. Reaves agreed, saying a co-op would boost the industry’s local economic impact. Another modern idea: Reaves wants to create a Florida barbecue road map app, and is looking for local app developers to help make it happen. The app would help visitors find local barbecue hot spots. “What started me on it was a pizza app I heard about, and it helps you order a pizza from wherever you are and I thought, ‘Why don’t we have a barbecue app?’ ” Further, Rivers believes a namesake Orlando food event featuring celebrity chefs, rather than a traditional barbecue competition, would draw visitors and boost local businesses, especially if it “has a barbecue tent and big names from across the country — people want to see the big-name chefs who are on TV and write cookbooks. Doing so benefits the scene in Orlando. You can reach a larger audience with big names at food events.” Tristano agreed that showcasing the local restaurants along with big names in barbecue may be the start of Orlando’s recipe for success. “It’s a good entry for Orlando to build a barbecue brand, attract chefs and build awareness around the barbecue restaurants that exist to get more growth in that part of the industry.” Meet the pitmasters John Rivers , chef and owner of 4R Restaurant Group , which owns the 4 Rivers Smokehouse chain Favorite BBQ entree? Brisket Secret to your sauce? I blended multiple flavors from the region to create a balanced flavor. Favorite ingredient? Pepper BBQ role model? Chris Lilly out of Alabama. He’s the all-time leader of world championships at Memphis in May. I bought his DVD of how to make pulled pork, and that’s how I learned how to make it. Your longest-prep dish? Brisket. It takes 18 hours. Most challenging dish to create? Brisket. It’s the toughest piece of meat to smoke and to make moist and tender on a consistent basis. Michael Reaves , owner, Cecil’s Texas-style Bar-B-Q Favorite BBQ entree? Brisket sandwich What’s the secret to your sauce? There’s no secret. We have three: mild, hot and sweet, and mild has a kick to it because Texas always has a kick. We dry cook everything, and most meats don’t need or use sauce. Favorite ingredient? Black pepper BBQ role model? My father Your longest-prep dish? Brisket Most challenging dish to create? The coleslaw and our hot beans. Both took about six months. Just trying to get the right mayonnaise for the coleslaw and the sweetness of the slaw took a long time. Finding the right mayo was the key. Thomas Ward , owner, Pig Floyd’s Urban Barbakoa Favorite BBQ entree? My Plain Jane, with pulled pork and slaw on our coconut pineapple roll. The ribs are second. What’s the secret to your sauce? It has citrus in it. Favorite ingredient? Salt BBQ role model? Franklin Barbecue in Austin, Texas Your longest-prep dish? The brisket takes 14 hours. Most challenging dish to create? The ribs, because of the whole process: We dry rub them, and in the middle of cooking, we take them out and baste them.
