Show more respect. Be more positive in your body language. These are some of the suggestions being thrown Nick Kyrgios’ way following the Aussie young gun’s performances at Wimbledon over the past 10 days.\nThe 20-year-old was the talk of the tournament more so for his behaviour than his tennis ability, as his abrasive personality divided opinion on whether he is good for the game or if he’s on the path to becoming one of the country’s most hated sportsmen.\nHowever, if there’s one person he should listen to when deciding how he wants to progress both as a player and a person, it’s his mum.\nSpeaking on Channel 7’s Sunrise on Thursday, Nill Kyrgios admitted her son needs to get better at the emotional side of his game.\n“We acknowledge the fact that he has to get better at controlling his emotions,” said Nill.\n“It’s good to question things that you believe are wrong but it’s just the way of going about it that’s the main thing.\n“There’ll be many more times when he’ll have to step back and say, ‘OK, how am I going to deal with this now?’”\nResponding to questions about whether Kyrgios would seek professional help to deal with his emotions on the court, be it from a sports psychologist or other experts, his mother said they would explore all their options.\n“We’re looking into what help we can get. Tennis Australia is behind us, they’re giving their support saying whatever we need to do to help Nick and we’re talking.\n“We will have to deal with it.”\nIt’s surprising Dawn Fraser didn’t make an appearance here to snatch the Australian flag away from Nill Kyrgios. Source: News Corp Australia\nThe fiery youngster was a lightning rod for attention during his run at the All England club, with his audacity simultaneously drawing the ire and praise of the tennis community. He said “dirty scum” when arguing with an umpire, bounced his racquet into the crowd, defied stewards by climbing onto a wall to watch a doubles match on an outer court, was accused of tanking and copped a racist attack from Australian swimming legend Dawn Fraser .\nWhile that list would make for good dinner table conversation, Kyrgios’ mum said she wasn’t going to talk tennis with Nick straight away after he returned home to Canberra on Wednesday night.\n“For the next few days we’re just going to let Nick be Nick at home, not discuss it too much,” said Nill.\n“I think he felt so relieved just to walk through that door.\n“I gave him a big squeeze, which he needed, and I love having him home.”\nKyrgios should take a leaf out of his mother’s book when it comes to dealing with emotions. Nill said she had to manage her own feelings when seeing all the negative publicity her son attracted at the year’s third grand slam.\n“I wasn’t expecting it to be so vicious I guess but it will go away. It’s upsetting. I just have to contain my emotions and don’t get offended or upset.”\nFrenchman Richard Gasquet ended Kyrgios’ run at the tournament in the round of 16.\nGasquet will take on defending champion Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals after disposing of Stan Wawrinka in the quarters, while Roger Federer will do battle with Andy Murray in the other semi-final.\nOriginally published as The one person Kyrgios should listen to", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/sport/tennis/nick-kyrgios-has-had-another-run-in-with-wimbledon-officials/story-fnu2pjj2-1227426401502", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227435/004668-8db3388e-25cd-11e5-b2b1-af71b9aa897c.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/sport/tennis/olympic-legend-dawn-fraser-launches-racist-attack-on-nick-kyrgios/story-fnu2pjj2-1227431907759", "http://www.news.com.au/sport/tennis/nick-kyrgios-is-widely-condemned-for-explosive-wimbledon-win/story-fnu2pjj2-1227422140798", "http://www.news.com.au/sport/tennis/nick-kyrgios-mum-has-some-pertinent-advice-for-her-wild-child/story-fnu2pjj2-1227435004707"], "published": "2015-07-09T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T06:34:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
