This will replace four of Qantas’ B747 Sydney-Los Angeles services per week and one Qantas B747 Melbourne-Los Angeles service per week.\nToday’s decision also allows Qantas to begin selling new codeshare services operated by American Airlines on the Sydney-Los Angeles route using their state of the art B777-300ER aircraft.\nQantas and American Airlines are now working to finalise the schedule of new services with fares available in coming weeks.\nServices will initially operate on peak days and ramp up to six per week in January from 27 January 2016. Sydney-San Francisco services will not operate on 23rd, 24th, 25th and 31st December 2015.\nSource: Qantas.\nRelated Posts Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building Austrian Airlines Financial Results as at 30 September 2013: Positive result gives optimism for break-even in 2013 BOC Aviation Marks 20th Year With Record Net Profit in 2013 Virgin airline named top u.s. airline in conde nast traveler’s 2013 readers’ choice awards Lufthansa Group increases result in core business", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T11:26:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
