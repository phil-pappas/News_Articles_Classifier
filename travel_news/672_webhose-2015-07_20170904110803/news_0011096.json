Clark The 40-foot-tall tower on a 200-foot-high bluff at High Cliff State Park provides sweeping views of Lake Winnebago. By Brian E. Clark , Special to the Journal Sentinel July 4, 2015 6:00 a.m. (0) Comments Madeline J. Clark David Lacount walks on a slackline hung between two trees at High Cliff State Park. Slacklining is popular with rock climbers. \nI've driven by Lake Winnebago perhaps dozens of times over the past decade on my way to Appleton, Green Bay, Manitowoc, Door County and other points north. \nBut it wasn't until I climbed a 40-foot-tall tower on a 200-foot-high bluff in High Cliff State Park recently that I got a true sense of how big Lake Winnebago is. From this perch, on the northeast corner of the lake, my daughter and I had a sweeping view of the huge body of water, carved by a glacier around 15,000 years ago. \nThere are more than eight miles of hiking trails in the forest-covered park. There's also a wetland where birds and butterflies often gather, a small museum in an old general store that tells the park's history, effigy mounds, a lakeside marina and 120 family camping sites, including eight for groups. \nOn the drive or hike up to the tower from the lakeside, it's easy to see where from 1855 to 1956 workers cut stone from the exposed Niagara Escarpment to be baked and turned into a kind of mortar. From the tower, we could also see down into a crevasse between two sections of limestone that had pulled apart centuries or even millennia ago. \nOne of the best ways to get a good feel for the escarpment is to hike the 3.4-mile Red Bird Trail or the 1.7-mile Lime Kiln Trail. The former goes along the top of the ridge and leads to a 12-foot statue of Winnebago Indian Chief Red Bird, while the latter requires a climb up through the cliffs and passes a number of abandoned lime kilns. Another popular path is the 0.6-mile Indian Mound Trail. \nThe limestone cliffs in the park are part of the Niagara Escarpment, which developed more than a million years ago when an inland sea covered much of the Midwest, said Cynthia Mueller, the park's naturalist. The escarpment has an arc of more than 1,000 miles, she noted, starting in southeast Wisconsin, running along the east side of Lake Winnebago and continuing north through Door County. It then dives under Lake Michigan, pops back up in Ontario, Canada, and ends at Niagara Falls, where the Niagara River plunges 165 feet over Horseshoe Falls and two smaller cataracts. \nMueller said geologists and biologists from around the world come to study the Niagara Escarpment in High Cliff State Park and the \"unique biosphere\" it creates. \nMost of the 1,200-acre park was once owned by the Western Lime and Cement Co., which began operations in the mid-19th century and included a company town known as High Cliff. The park's general store museum includes artifacts from the early days of the limestone mining company and the town it supported. An amusement park also operated on the land, Mueller said. \n\"Even before Western Lime closed, the state was looking to create a park here,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, it didn't have enough money to do that in the beginning. But some folks, who were the environmentalists of their time, got together to buy land as it became available. They were led by Gordon Bubolz, a state senator whom a nature center in Appleton is named for.\" \nShe said it wasn't until 1964 that the recreation area — the only state park on Lake Winnebago — was officially opened. \nMueller, who has worked at the park for nearly 20 years, said she has a special connection to the people who lived and worked here for more than a century. \n\"My great-grandparents moved here in 1855, so for me it's a real privilege to come to work here each day,\" she said. \"When you come to the park office, that was their front yard. Great-Grandpa Joe came here from Germany to work. My grandfather followed in his footsteps, and so did my father for a time. They all worked at the lime plant.\" \nMueller said her forebears quarried the rock, broke it up and transported it to the kilns, which cooked the limestone at 2,200 degrees for six hours, turning it into a powdery substance that was made into a mortar. They also processed crushed lime. \n\"Eventually, the company ran into a substandard rock and closed these quarries down,\" she said. \nCharlotte Barribeau, president of Friends of High Cliff State Park , said she never tires of walking the park's trails in any season. \n\"It's wonderful now in the summer, of course,\" said Barribeau, who moved to the community of Sherwood in 1998 and lives less than a half mile from the park. \"But in the winter, it sometimes becomes what I call a 'crystal palace.' \n\"The trees get all frosty and sparkle when the sun hits them. We go cross-country skiing and snowshoeing or just walk the roads. I'd say we go there almost every day of the year that we are here. It really is a wonderful, serene place.\" \nBarribeau said the Friends group raises money for the park, buys equipment for the maintenance workers and donates time and labor for park projects. \n\"That's especially important because of cuts to the state parks budget,\" she said. \"We've helped with the butterfly pond trail, which has bridges and a waterfall. It's a beautiful wetland and sometimes you'll see deer there. It's paved, too, so it's accessible to wheelchairs.\" \nShe said her grandchildren, who range in age from 2 to 21, like to visit the park. The teens, she noted, are especially fond of hiking up to the tower and then climbing it for the views. \nIn addition to hiking, Barribeau said she likes to sit on the cliff and watch the sun set over the lake in the west. \n\"That has to be my favorite thing,\" she said. \"The sunsets from up there are just phenomenal.\" \nGetting there: High Cliff State Park is on Lake Winnebago just outside Sherwood, about 100 miles northwest of Milwaukee via I-41 and Highways 151 and 55. \nMore information: The park is open year-round from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. For more information, see dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/highcliff or call (920) 989-1106.
