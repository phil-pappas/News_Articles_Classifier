JOHNSON The Associated Press \nCHICAGO (AP) — Aretha Franklin’s spokesman said the Queen of Soul was grateful and exclaimed “Hallelujah!” after the state of Illinois helped out when her tour bus broke down on the way to Chicago and left her stranded along a highway. \nTransmission problems stopped the bus around 1:20 a.m. Monday a few miles from downtown on eastbound Interstate 290. Franklin’s assistants started calling car services to transport her from the side of the road, but they had no luck. \n“All were closed or had no vehicles because of the late hour and the holiday weekend,” Franklin spokesman Clarence Waldron said. \nThat’s when the Illinois State Police stepped in.
