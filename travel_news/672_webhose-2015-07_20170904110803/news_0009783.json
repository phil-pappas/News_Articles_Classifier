I wish Mittu all the very best in his future endeavours.” \nSridhara joined Tui in March 2012 with his main focus being to transform Tui Group into a digital online business that is able to serve its customers “Anywhere, Anytime, Anyway”. \nHe is now being replaced by Bailey who joined the Tui UK and Ireland in October 2009 as its director of IT strategy and planning, moving up to be IT director in October 2010. \nEbel said: “I am pleased to announce the appointment of Chris Bayley as new group CIO. \n“I have been particularly impressed at how Chris has led his team to deliver the Phoenix project, building large technology change across all aspects of the selling systems, tour operator systems and the introduction of customer system capabilities. \n“I am confident that Chris and his team will successfully drive forward our digital agenda, implementing common IT platforms across the TUI Group.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T12:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T13:24:41.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
