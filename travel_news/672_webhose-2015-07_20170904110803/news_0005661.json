Now it's up to Congress to decide whether the boundary of the Antietam battlefield near Sharpsburg should be adjusted to include the 510-acre site across the Potomac River.\nCongressional authorization would enable the park service to acquire land or conservation easements.\nThe Shepherdstown battle was the final engagement of the Maryland Campaign , which included clashes at Harpers Ferry, South Mountain and Antietam.\nThe Battle of Shepherdstown is also known as the Battle of Boteler's (BUT'-lers) Ford. It was fought Sept. 19 and 20, 1862, two days after the battle of Antietam. It resulted in more than 600 casualties.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T11:14:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
