Louisville’s largest convention will return to the city this fall with more than 60,000 students and advisors.\n“Last year, not only did we see students attending from all over the country, but people made the trip just to volunteer their time,” said Rose Caple, volunteer coordinator for the LCVB. “Last year more than one-thousand volunteer hours were donated to the FFA convention and we are looking to grow that number for 2015.”\nVolunteer positions include working at the FFA MegaStore inside the expo, city information assistance and accompanying groups on off-site educational tours. Volunteers will receive training and a Louisville shirt to wear during the shift.\nThe National FFA convention will run from October 28-October 31 at the Kentucky Exposition Center. Attendees will learn about careers in the agriculture industry, compete for scholarships, volunteer in the “Days of Service” program and shape the future of the National FFA Organization.\nSource:- LCVB\nRelated Posts ‘Earn While you Learn’ Programme – India Seoul to Host UIA Associations Round Table Asia Meeting in October Refreshed March Marketplace a success Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre announces a record 2014 as it celebrates its 10th anniversary Hometown Tourist Celebration Kick-off & Attraction Showcase", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T17:37:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
