The answer is no. (Back off, mojito). When it comes to seasonal sipping, sangria fits the bill for the fairest season of them all. Simply put, sangria tastes like a holiday in Spain and who wouldn’t want a drink like that? Here, with the help of Pedro Carvalho, cocktail mastermind and operations director at Ibérica Restaurants, we deconstruct the ultimate sangria. El Clásico “A classic sangria was originally created to flavour cheap wine with fruits and other alcoholic beverages in order to make a light, refreshing cocktail that is perfect for the hot weather,” says Carvalho. But despite its threadbare roots – and although sangria is often made with cheap plonk today – for the best punch, Carvalho says, always make sure “each ingredient, including the wine, is of superb quality”. So much as you’ve wanted to get rid of it, give that bottle under the kitchen sink with the label hanging off a wide berth. Wine wisdom The other ingredients in the traditional sangria are brandy (or other strong liquor), a mixer and seasonal fruit. Wine, however, is the main star. “The wine needs to have good body and flavour to stand up to the strong flavours of other alcoholic ingredients such as brandy,” says Carvalho. “The wine we use in our red sangria for example is the Marqués de Caro – a wine using 100 per cent tempranillo grapes from Valencia.” Pick your wine carefully - not just any old plonk will do (ALAMY) Other possible varieties include Garnacha, with its rich fruitiness and acidity, and Zinfandel with its jammy kick. Merlot and Shiraz will also work. Lesser-known grape varieties might offer a cheaper option, such as Bonarda from Argentina, with its plummy richness, and the dark but juicy Nero d’Avola from Sicily. Made of stronger stuff It would be easy to think that the perfect sangria is made with Spanish brandy, but that’s not the case according to Carvalho. At Ibérica they experiment. “We not only use brandy, we also use peach liquor to bring in a fruit flavour for the summer,” he says. “Gin is a great alternative as well because the botanicals within the spirit brings a different taste to a classic drink.” Other options include the motherland favourite Licor 43, a liqueur made with citrus fruits, herbs and spices; Cognac is a worthy option, as is Southern Comfort with its sweet and smoother notes. Dark rum or even whisky are both last chance saloons and the balanced sweetness of fortified wines such as Marsala or Madeira will suffice. Vodka – despite what you might read – is probably a bit too harsh. Mix it up As it's packed full of alcohol, we need something to slow this booze train down. In Spain they use La Casera, a fizzy drink which is similar to American0style ‘soda’ (our lemonade). However, soda water, lemonade, orange juice or grapefruit juice – for tartness – and even fizzy orange drinks such as Fanta, Orangina or Tango work well. Whatever you chose, ice is a must-have ingredient and not just to keep the drink cool. “Approximately 20 per cent of the jug size should be filled with ice,” says Carvalho. “The proportion of ice used as opposed to the liquid is important to ensure the cocktail doesn't become diluted and tastes the same with every glass.” Feeling fruity In sangria the fruit isn’t just for garnish, it’s a pivotal part of the drink’s flavour. Marinating in the fridge for at least a few hours is the key to getting a super fruity punch, as the fruit will absorb the alcohol, which in turn will mingle with the fruit’s oils and juices, creating a fruity depth. Carvalho says to change the fruit you use in your sangrias depending on the season. However “the typical fruits are apples, oranges, lemons, limes and grapes.” Peaches, strawberries and bananas can also work and whacking in a few cinnamon sticks won’t hurt either. You can use many different types of fruit in sangria... but maybe not this much (ALAMY) Beyond the classic “People's palettes have changed and trends evolve so at Ibérica we have been innovative and creative, offering white, cava and beer options,” says Carvalho. The latter includes strawberries and pineapple, peach liqueur, apple and orange juices and Estrella Galicia. Makes a change: sangria with white wine (ALAMY) If you’re making a white sangria, Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon work well, as do Torrontés, Chenin Blanc and Riesling. A splosh of rose doesn’t go amiss, either. However, wine certainly isn’t the only way to go. There are some white sangria recipes which include a generous helping of sake. When it comes to sangria, it’s time to experiment. Try this at home: Iberica’s Cava Sangria Recipe MAKES A jug (1.5 litres) INGREDIENTS 375 ml cava 15 ml peach liqueur 15 ml Cointreau 125 ml orange juice 125 ml lemonade 2 tbsp granulated fine sugar ½ orange 4 strawberries 4 raspberries 4 blackberries 1 tbsp pomegranate seeds 6 mint leaves Ice METHOD Pour all fruits, peach liqueur, sugar, mint leaves, orange juice and few ice cubes into a jug.
