(AP) â€” The scientist who led a crew to excavate ice age fossils from the mouth of an unexplored cave in the Black Hills is updating the public on what's been found so far.\nJim Mead and a team of researchers began excavating Persistence Cave in June. During their two-week field camp, the researchers removed sediment from the cave that contains ice age fossils.\nThe fossils date back potentially 11,000 years. They'll provide clues of past climates and help researchers study how animals have adapted to changing environments.\nMead will be at Wind Cave National Park on July 25 to give the public an update on the fossils found so far. There will also be an update on efforts to expand the small cave that could connect with the larger Wind Cave.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-07-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T15:26:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
