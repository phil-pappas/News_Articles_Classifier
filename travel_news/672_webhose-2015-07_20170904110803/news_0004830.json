Working adults need to plan for time off; kids' schedules need to be accommodated. And some families need time to save for travel expenses.\nDon't go it alone: The more people involved in the planning, the more people will feel invested in the event. Planning a reunion, especially a large one, is not a one-person job. Put someone in charge of securing lodging, another in charge of food, a third can plan activities.\nFamily reunions: By the numbers 63 percent: Americans who say they have attended a family reunion\n5 days: Average length of a reunion trip\n8 adults, 4 kids: Average size of family gathering\n28 percent: Reunion-goers who say \"drinking too much\" is the top way to offend family members (in second place: \"paying too much attention to your phone\")\nSource: HomeAway Family Reunion Survey, 2014\nSize matters: How do you define family? Siblings, grandparents and grandchildren? Cousins, uncles and great-nephews? In general, the larger the group, the more planning time required. If this is your first reunion, it's best to start small – and then grow.\nLocation, location location: Choose a place that's equidistant for everyone, or a long way from all; a place you've been before, or a place you've always wanted to explore. National and state parks are popular choices; so, too, are urban centers (though consider booking hotel rooms in the suburbs to save money). Almost any place a family can vacation will work. Many larger hotels and resorts have group planners who can help you get organized. Or check with the region's visitors bureau for itinerary ideas.\nActivities for all: Survey your family to find out what's important: golf, shopping, fishing, nightlife? \"Some older family members may be fine with a comfortable folding chair under a shade tree,\" said Wagner, though that's usually not enough for the majority. Young adults are the most difficult to attract to reunions – so plan some activities specifically for them.\nRemember, too, the importance of down time. Too many activities can be as much of a problem as too few.\nPay attention to price: Young families, in particular, typically don't have a large travel budget. Keep finances in mind when you're considering potential destinations.\nChoosing the date: Some families tie their reunion to an important event – a milestone wedding anniversary or birthday. Other groups build their gathering around a holiday (July 4 is a popular choice). Whatever date you choose, don't move it once it's set. Invariably, someone won't be able to come. But as soon as you move the date for one, you'll be pressured to move it for another.", "external_links": ["http://reunionsmag.com/"], "published": "2015-07-15T17:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T20:50:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
