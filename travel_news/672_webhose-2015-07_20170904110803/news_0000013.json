The half-Brit, half-Spaniard has more than 20 years’ experience in the hotel industry, working for some of the world’s top luxury hospitality brands including Inter-Continental, Ritz-Carlton and Fairmont. \nHaving enjoyed high-profile roles at a number of locations worldwide including London, the Middle East, China and Tenerife as well as, most recently, in Barcelona, Adrian is relishing his new task of helping La Manga Club build on its established reputation in the sports and leisure industry as Spain’s flagship resort. He said: “La Manga Club is a name that is famous all over the world and it’s a great honour to be given the opportunity to shape its future, both in the short and long-term. “The resort is renowned for delivering outstanding service to its guests and has made significant investment recently to help maintain its position as Europe’s premier sports and leisure destination. I believe I have a lot to offer La Manga Club and can enhance it in many different areas so we can match and exceed the high standards already in place.” Set over 1,400 acres in an area three times the size of Monaco, La Manga Club has set the standard for sports and lifestyle destination resort since its inception in 1972. Among its recent accolades, the resort was named as Spain’s leading golf complex at the 2014 World Golf Awards and handed the accolade of ‘Best Golf Resort in Spain’ by UK readers of Today’s Golfer magazine for the fourth year running and named as one of the top five golf resorts in the world at the prestigious 2015 UltraTravel Awards. Boasting three 18-hole golf courses, La Manga Club’s extensive facilities also include a new Leadbetter Golf Academy – the only one in mainland Spain – a 28-court tennis academy, a new High Performance Sports Centre and 2,000m² spa and fitness complex. In addition, there is a five-star hotel, four-star serviced apartments and townhouses and more than 20 bars and restaurants for members of all the family to enjoy.
