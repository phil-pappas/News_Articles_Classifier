So extreme were his notes, the FBI initially believed the letters were an extortion attempt.\n“I have gotten that desperate and that mad and would come up with ideas that ... it scares me that I might come up with some crazy or really dumb idea,” he writes.\n“I might hurt someone with some crazy idea and not realise how stupid an idea is until after I have done it. That really scares me.”\nIn almost a year and a half, the unidentified fan sent 66 letters to Houston and a further 10 more to representatives of the star, including Houston’s father. All went unanswered.\n“Many times when I think about you I will start to shake. Miss Whitney, what am I doing wrong? I am in love with you. I really and truly am in love with you. Whitney, please, please give me a chance.”\nHouston eventually contacted the FBI for help.\nThe golden days: Whitney Houston in 1987. Picture: David McGough Inc.

Source: Supplied\n“Upon [blank] receiving the letter and determining its contents contained vague and non-specific threats, [blank] became concerned with Houston’s wellbeing,” reads the 1988 FBI report.\nMuch of the FBI report on the case remains redacted, including the identity of the fan except for his hometown of Vermont, in northeast U.S.\nIn an interview with the FBI at a later date, he was described as 170cm, 65 kilograms with brown hair and brown eyes. He was unemployed at the time but had served with the US Army.\nHis letters, postmarked Burlington, Vermont, tell a different story.\n“I am not a love struck kid,” he defends.\n“I am 28 years old, a former combat engineer sergeant and I am now a political activist”.\nHe writes how he first fell in love with Houston in March 1986, the month she released The Greatest Love of All .\n“Miss Whitney, you are a beautiful lady and a beautiful person.\n“I really and truly am in love with you.”\n”Why can’t you respond to my 70-plus letters?” Source: Supplied\n”You probably think I’m crazy. Well maybe I am”. Source: Supplied\nIn another letter, the fan pleads with a close aide to Houston, explaining his desire for the singer to receive his letters expressing his undying love.\n“When I first fell in love with Miss Whitney I tried to ignore what I felt towards her,” he writes.\n“After 5 months I had to do something and so I started writing letters. I have tried to stop writing the letters and to give up twice but after a few weeks I had to start writing again. I just have to keep trying.\n“I have tried to forget what I feel towards her a few times. I have gotten mad at her a few times, a few of the letters have not been very nice. I have gotten so mad and desperate.”\nHe describes himself as “sort of a loner” who is “not very good with people.”\nHe explains he has been to nine of Houston’s concerts “and have tried to give her flowers twice. Miss Whitney is the first lady that I have ever given flowers to”.\n“When I think about you I will start to shake”. Source: Supplied\n“I almost broke down”. Source: Supplied\nIn another letter, he describes how he “almost broke down” when he read a tabloid suggesting Houston was married.\n“I am sure they made it up ... I have been sick for the last several days. I cannot stop thinking about it and I just shake and feel sick in my gut.\n“You probably think I am crazy. Well, meebe (sic) I am. I just can’t give up. I have to keep trying. I really am in love with you.”\nOn June 8, 1988, after the 79th letter to Houston — including six to her father and a further 16 to family acquaintances — the FBI finally knocked on the man’s door to find a “small, cluttered one-room apartment”.\n“He advised that he had no intention of threatening Houston or anyone else with physical harm,” the report reads.\n”In conversation with [blank] it was apparent that he is obsessed with Whitney Houston.\n“He did not appear to interact well socially with the interviewing Agent in that he was very uncomfortable.\nThe FBI eventually concluded, “based on the facts presented” the fan “did not constitute a violation of Federal Law”.\nAnd with that, the case was closed.\nA copy of one of the envelopes addressed to Whitney Houston.
