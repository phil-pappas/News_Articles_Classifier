The Hogs and Heifers country and western-themed honky-tonk bar, its walls and ceilings lined with bras contributed by female patrons, was the last hold-out from an earlier era in the Meatpacking District. The area is now the definition of gentrification and hipsterdom, with designer clothes stores and swanky clubs pushing out dive bars and 24-hour diner s. There are still a few of the slaughterhouse businesses after which the district is named, where workers in bloodied smocks load carcasses into refrigerated trucks at dawn, but their numbers are dwindling fast. Back in 1992, when Hogs and Heifers opened, the bar’s rent was $3,000 a month. Paul McCartney, Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt were among the host of celebrity guests at the raucous locale (and Roberts famously was among those who left her bra behind). Julia Roberts was one of many celebrities who partied at the bar (Photo: AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Nathan Denette) The owner, Michelle Dell, had already seen the rents rise to $40,000 a month, but the new landlords have just hiked the figure to $60,000 for the 1,250 sq ft site. The rate is not astronomical by the standards of the ’hood, but it is much more than Mrs Dell can pay selling Pabst Blue Ribbon beer for three dollars a can to her loyal clientele. “There is no room for the small, independent business in New York,” Mrs Dell said. “This is a city that is throwing its history to the kerb.”  The “G” word – gentrification – is one subject guaranteed to enliven debate around any New York dinner table. On the one side are those who cite how life improved under the mayorships of Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg, as crime was cut and once “no-go” areas reclaimed. On the other are those who complain how the city has lost much of its edge and has been priced into blandness. But it’s not just the price of property, rented or bought, that is such a challenge for new arrivals. The legendarily haughty boards of New York apartment blocks add to the complications with their demanding requirements for aspiring residents. New York is indeed one of the most rule-obsessed cities in the world. And this week, I have been reminded how hard it is not to just to move in to the city – but also to move out. I have had to fill out countless forms in quadruplicate just to arrange for my possessions to be shifted from my apartment. Even charity stores here have become incredibly sniffy about what they will take as a donation. And then, in such a litigious city, there is also the welter of insurance documents required for every workman crossing the front door – a slew of $1 million liability cover notes made out to the building’s owners and managers, in case a scratch is inflicted. When I left my flat in London, I simply coughed up for the removal company and that was is it. Oh, for those easy times.

That is a startling turnaround from the sentiment on Barack Obama’s first election night victory seven years ago, when two thirds of Americans believed the opposite. I was in Chicago’s Grant Park that evening for the euphoric celebrations as the city’s blacks, whites, Latinos and Asians mixed joyously to celebrate the election of the country’s first African-American president. And then, as they streamed home, they parted ways. The whites headed into the city centre and towards the northern suburbs. The blacks overwhelmingly turned right and headed for the city’s South Side, the country’s largest African-American community. Chicago was indeed a racial microcosm of America that heady November evening – both in Grant Park, where the hope of a better future was played out so inspiringly, and in the reality of where the city slept that night.
