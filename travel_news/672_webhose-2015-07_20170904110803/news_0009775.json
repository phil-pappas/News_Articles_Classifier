It will be followed by a half-day tourism forum on The Singapore Tourism Experience on July 17, at which participants will be introduced to best practices in the South-East Asian island city-state.\nThis forum will examine six main areas relating to Singapore’s strategic approach to tourism. These include planning and development, product development, partnerships, investment and financing, marketing and education and training.\nThe programme also includes informative and thought-provoking discussions from a panel of tourism experts, led by the CTO’s secretary general, Hugh Riley.\nRelated Posts TripAdvisor touches mark of 100 million downloads for free app for iPhone and Android Expanded Train Services From Decmber 2013 – Scot Rail Siemens to realign regional organization and strengthen corporate units BOC Aviation Marks 20th Year With Record Net Profit in 2013 Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T21:43:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
