And I was like ‘no, this is just me’. They were so shocked by how loud and confident and out of control I was, I don’t think they were expecting it. They always say a few champagnes give you confidence but I was like ‘I have enough confidence as it is!’” OK, calm down Sandra. Source: Channel 10\nSandra, 27, a primary school teacher from Victoria. Source: Channel 10\nSandra got a large proportion of the airtime on the debut episode, largely due to her confrontation with fellow Bachelorette Reshael.\nSo if first impressions are everything, why did she decide to confront one of the girls so early in the game?\n“Emotions are running high, the public only sees an hour of the whole filming, but we were there for so long. The most important thing for me is that I’ve got a really positive\npersonality and if I need to defend myself, I will. I want to air things and get them out, I hate bottling things up and I wanted to address it with Reshael, tell her how I felt, clear the air and move on.\n“I don’t regret anything I said or did although it did escalate more than it needed to when other people who weren’t there got involved. Hopefully Australia will like the funny side of me and not the out of control trying to attack people side of me.”\nSandra says she is mindful of the scrutiny her big personality might attract, but isn’t worried about how the public will perceive her because she knows she was her authentic self on the show.\nSandra needs her dosage adjusted #TheBachelorAu\n— MandyKerr (@MandyKerr) July 29, 2015 OMG SHUT UP SANDRA! HOW ARE YOU A TEACHER. YOURE GOING TO GET PUNCHED! #TheBachelorAU\n— Jess (@jess_kate26) July 29, 2015 Sandra and Reshael had a little confrontation on night one of The Bachelor Australia. Source: Channel 10\n“The advice I’ve been given is to not worry about it,” she says of the “feedback” she might receive on social media. “I’m the type of person who does take things to heart, but people at home don’t know me, they only know five minutes of me on TV and I only care about what my friends and family say about me.”\nShe adds that she is aware she may come off as an “attention seeker” but can’t help if her positivity is misconstrued.\n“If you’re looking from the outside, you could probably see it that way, but if you get to know me, you’ll see that I’m so excited about everything in life, I see the good in everyone and everything. I give 200 per cent to everything in life, I’m just a big kid really and the people that know me will agree that I’m like this 100 per cent of the time.” The contestants of the new season of The Bachelor, seated with Sam. . Source: Supplied\nOne can’t help but think that being 200 per cent of yourself all the time must be exhausting.\n“I do get tired, I’m human and that’s obvious, but when I have Sandra time, I don’t sit in a corner being quiet, I’m at the gym or I’m dancing, I’m never sitting around, I’m still burning energy.”\nSo why then, with all that energy is this bubbly, bold and beautiful brunette still single?\n“Most men are intimidated by my big personality, they lack the maturity to handle Sandra.”\nBest of luck with that Sam.
