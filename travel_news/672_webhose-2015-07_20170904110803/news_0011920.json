Located at 566 Aguajito Road, atop Gentry Hill, Tres Paraguas is an eco-friendly, secluded complex comprised of five pueblos covered by soaring steel roofs. Currently listed for $18.5 million , the property will sell at or above an $11.5 million reserve on August 15th in cooperation with Mike Canning of Canning Properties Group, with Sotheby's International Realty. \"Tres Paraguas pairs stunning design with ocean views that uniquely come together to present a world-class property,\" Canning said. \"The architecture is a striking display of modern art, on a scale unlike any other. This property is a must-see â€” words and photos just cannot do it justice. We invite all interested parties to make an appointment to see this extraordinary estate in person.\"Tres Paraguas features four bedrooms, four full bathrooms and two half bathrooms over 12,481 square feet. The master bedroom offers an asymmetric metal fireplace and bay views from a private terrace, and the master bath suite includes both a man's and woman's dressing room. The property's 18-foot ceilings and 12-foot disappearing sliding glass walls make way for seamless indoor/outdoor living, complete with panoramic ocean and forest views. Outdoors, the half-acre complex enjoys a generous enclosed courtyard with a perfectly-manicured lawn, raised pool and cantina with outdoor bar and kitchen. Two guest suites feature large custom bathrooms and private entrances off the courtyard, in addition to a separate guest pueblo. \"When I was shown this property, I thought - this is an opportunity to create a home living environment that is totally complete and private,\" stated Mann. \"This property at the top of this little hill would become it's own world, and I wanted to capture that; I wanted to enclose it and give whoever is trying to live in this environment a world of their own. It was almost impossible. I absolutely feel I accomplished it.\" \"Working with Ron Mann , my family and I spent many years creating a home with a distinct appreciation for the natural beauty and splendor of California living. This is reflected in every aspect of Tres Paraguas, including the use of environmentally-conscious and locally-sourced materials,\" stated the seller, Robert Carroll . \"We are confident that the fortunate next owners will appreciate and fall in love with our hidden escape, just as we did years ago.\"Located in between Los Angles and San Francisco along California's scenic coast, the Monterey Peninsula offers some of the most beautiful views, weather and recreational amenities. Made up of the cities of Monterey , Carmel and Pacific Grove and the resort community of Pebble Beach , each of the peninsula's seaside communities offers its own individual version of the idyllic California coastal lifestyle. The exclusive region includes two luxury hotels and multiple golf courses, including three at the famed Pebble Beach Resort, five-time host of the U.S. Open Golf. It is also home to the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, an automotive charitable event held each August on the Pebble Beach Golf Links, which is considered the most prestigious of its kind. Carmel was recently ranked by Travel+Leisure magazine as one of the best cities for romance thanks to the town's quaint cottages and shops, art galleries, restaurants, white-sand beaches, landscaped bluffs and natural parklands. \"The architecture and design of Tres Paraguas is exquisite. It truly is a work of art,\" said Laura Brady , president of Concierge Auctions. \"The auction format is ideal for bringing interested buyers together and identifying value for properties like this, just as it has been proven for centuries with other one-of-a-kind art assets.\"Concierge Auctions will host a preview event at the property from 10am to 1pm on July 28th . The property will be available for viewing daily from 1pm to 4pm and by appointment. The auction will be held on August 15th . Brokers are protected.
