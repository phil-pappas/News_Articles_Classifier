A follow up meeting with ESPN vice president John Walsh was effectively sabotaged by then-Gawker editor A.J. Daulerio—in the form of a human telegram dressed in a gorilla suit, singing the SportsCenter theme.\nCraggs did not end up getting the Grantland job. However, he doesn’t seem to hold it against Simmons.\nIn 2014, Craggs was complementary of Simmons’ talent as a producer, editor, and curator of talent—even is he was less than fanatical of Simmons’ writing style:\nHe’s generally a force for good in Bristol. “30 For 30” is excellent—it’s what can happen when the best impulses of Bill Simmons align with the best impulses of ESPN—and Grantland, for all its faults, pays real money for writers I like a great deal to write about the things that interest them. It turns out Simmons has better, more catholic tastes than his own writing would suggest, which is the best thing you could ever say about an editor-in-chief\nAs editor-in-chief, Simmons led Grantland to critical acclaim , if not absolute financial success ; while Craggs was promoted from Deadspin editor to the executive editor of all of Gawker Media.\nNow, for the time being, they are both without jobs.\nSimmons is waiting out the reminder of his contract, after John Skipper decided ESPN would not be renewing their deal . Craggs resigned Monday (along with Gawker.com editor Max Read) after the business managers of the site voted to remove a post —an anonymously-sourced post outing a Condé Nast executive who tried to hire a gay porn star for sex. Craggs had previously stated he would have to quit if the post was taken down, citing a breach of editorial independence.\nNow the Craggs speculation begins, as it has for months now for Simmons.\nThe 15-year ESPNer was being chased by HBO, according to The Hollywood Reporter , but is said to have “several suitors.”\nWith Simmons’ popularity, Sport Illustrated media reporter Richard Deitsch wrote , “Simmons could use his high profile to start his own multimedia platform with investment from private equity.”\nAccording to multiple reports , some Grantland editors/writers are looking to follow Simmons wherever he goes.\nMaybe Craggs could be one of them.\nStay Up-To-Date On Top Stories — Follow Boston.com Follow Us", "external_links": ["http://recode.net/2014/12/10/gawker-media-shuffles-org-chart-names-tommy-craggs-top-editor/", "http://www.si.com/more-sports/2015/05/08/bill-simmons-espn-part-ways", "http://deadspin.com/5789851/espns-corporate-blog-finds-rock-bottom-somewhere-in-this-idiots-office", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hbos-real-life-game-thrones-802764", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/09/sports/bill-simmons-and-espn-are-parting-ways.html?ref=sports", "http://deadspin.com/no-one-knows-what-espn-is-doing-to-grantland-1718037323", "http://adage.com/article/media/grantland-earns-national-magazine-award-nominations/296627/", "http://deadspin.com/my-full-quote-which-is-little-kinder-than-the-stray-pi-1569398469", "http://gawker.com/gawker-is-removing-story-about-conde-nast-cfo-1718582003", "http://gawker.com/tommy-craggs-and-max-read-are-resigning-from-gawker-1719002144", "http://deadspin.com/5796720/an-exclusive-interview-with-tommy-craggs-about-the-bill-simmons-grantland-project", "http://web.archive.org/web/20081203142702/http:/www.grantland.com/text/siteintro.htm", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bill-simmons-what-he-might-794630", "http://deadspin.com/5807569/albino-man-pink-gorilla-singing-sportscenter-theme-song-a-story-about-deadspin-and-espns-grantland-project", "http://www.businessinsider.com/grantland-and-fivethirtyeight-traffic-2014-10"], "published": "2015-07-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T03:13:54.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
