Kitty O’Sheas will vie for a second Golden Noodle Award, which will go to the restaurant in each session with the winning recipe. Tickets are $60 per session and will be available Aug. 31 through macandcheesechicago.com or Ticketmaster. Entry (attendees must be at least 10 years old) includes all you can eat plus five drink tickets.
