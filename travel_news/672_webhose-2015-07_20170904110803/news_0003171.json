The latest incident happened in Rome in the early hours of Monday, when at least three American tourists – two young men and a woman – stripped off and waded into the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (the Fountain of the Four Rivers), in Piazza Navona, one of the city’s most elegant squares. In a pale imitation of the most famous scene from La Dolce Vita, the classic film in which Anita Ekberg waded into the Trevi Fountain in a black evening gown , the visitors laughed and joked while splashing in the waters of the fountain. They were watched by a group of council refuse collectors who did nothing to stop them. The huge stone monument, which was completed in 1651, is one of the most extravagant and acclaimed works by the sculptor Bernini. Rome's famous Trevi fountain (Alamy) Four immense human figures represent the longest rivers of the four continents that were known at the time – the Nile in Africa, the Danube in Europe, the Plate of the Americas and the Ganges in Asia. On the same night, a group of young Belgian tourists leapt into another fountain, featuring the figure of Neptune, just a few steps away. “Three in the morning and the fountain in Piazza Navona is used like a swimming pool, right under the eyes of rubbish collectors,” said Nathalie Naim, a local councillor. “By night Rome’s monuments are abandoned and used in improper and damaging ways. We need a police presence and intervention from the authorities who work in these places.” Tourists regularly clamber over priceless monuments and statues in Italy, either intentionally damaging them or inadvertently snapping bits off . Italians, who in general drink modestly and abhor public drunkenness, often find themselves taken aback by the behaviour of tourists. Last week a pair of Australians was caught having sex on a bench along the Arno River in the middle of Florence. Passersby called the police and the couple – a man aged 20 and a woman aged 23 – were booked for committing an obscene act in a public place. Last month in Rome, a couple was caught having sex in broad daylight in Rome’s historic Trastevere district, just across the river from Piazza Navona. Also in June, a young British tourist was arrested after having sex with a Ukrainian woman in a public park in Trieste in the country’s north-east. In May a pair of tourists damaged a monument featuring statues of Hercules, in the town of Cremona, by clambering on to it in order to snap a \"selfie\". In February dozens of drunken Dutch football hooligans invaded Piazza di Spagna in Rome, damaging a boat-shaped fountain known as the Barcaccia. It had only just been restored. Dario Franceschini, the culture minister, has decried such behaviour and said Italy would rather welcome a more refined class of visitor. He said the country wanted more “quality tourists” to off-set the millions who tread a well-worn trail between Rome, Florence and Venice, inundating those cities while ignoring hundreds of lesser-known attractions . “We want to see the return of cultured visitors and we need to tempt them away from the Rome-Venice-Florence route,” the minister said. “For this reason we are devoting funding to less well-known sites. Even in Rome, Venice and Florence, there are places that hardly anyone visits.” Follow @telegraphtravel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T23:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T04:32:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
