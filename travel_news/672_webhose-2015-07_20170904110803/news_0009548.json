After the city’s week-long appearance at Expo Milano 2015 in July it is likely to have even more fans. • Work to create entrepreneurship city gets going At the expo, visitors watched Chengdu’s promotional video, which showcased cute pandas, delicious hotpot and the city’s rich cultural and historical traditions. The video became reality as visitors could try authentic Chengdu food, enjoy local performances and paint pictures of pandas. A city view of Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province Hotpot is probably the most popular dish associated with Chengdu. As the birthplace of Sichuan cuisine, one of four major Chinese styles of cooking, it has a lot of dishes to offer. One of German chancellor Angela Merkel’s favourite Sichuan dishes is kung pao chicken, which she learnt how to cook when she visited the city last year. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization named Chengdu a City of Gastronomy in 2010 , making it the first city in Asia to be awarded the accolade. Local Sichuan Opera also has fans across the world. As one of China’s oldest operas, it features intricate masks, swordplay, fire breathing and face-changing that impresses both Chinese and overseas audiences. Yu Jia, an actress from the Chengdu Opera Art Research Institute, said as increasing numbers of overseas visitors went to see the opera, they received more offers to perform abroad. “I have just been to Japan, Egypt, France and the United States, and the audiences there showed even more enthusiasm than those at home,” she said. A woman works on woven embroidery, Shu brocade, another legacy of the Chengdu culture The delicately woven embroidery, Shu brocade, has long won international praise and is another legacy of the rich Chengdu culture. “People in the Roman Empire used silk from Chengdu. Chengdu’s brocade was popular in Japan during the Tang Dynasty (AD 618-907),” said Wang Yi, curator of the Chengdu Museum. Sheme, a local shoe brand that combines traditional Chinese elements and Western fashion, is restoring Shu brocade’s popularity. Late in 2013, Sheme, headquartered in Chengdu, debuted its Butterfly and Blossoms collection at London Fashion Week, becoming the first Chinese footwear brand to make it to the renowned event. Now it also has stores in Beijing and Shanghai and is planning to make inroads to London, Paris, Milan and Hong Kong. Named as one of the 52 places to go in 2015 by The New York Times, Chengdu’s popularity is also rooted in its large number of places of interest. The city’s Jinsha Ruins have been hailed as a significant archaeological discovery as they show a thriving culture existed in Chengdu more than 3,000 years ago. The Dujiangyan Irrigation Project, known as one of the major water conservancy projects during the Warring States Period (475-221 BC), was designed and built by Li Bing, a major official in the region in about 256 BC. The project is still functioning today. Qingcheng Mountain, 12 miles from Dujiangyan, is the birthplace of Chinese Taoism. Many Taoist temples still stand on the mountain. Chengdu has also been at the forefront of reforms and opening-up of western China Chengdu received 1.97 million overseas visitors last year, a rise of almost 12 per cent from the previous year, and the local tourism bureau said the city would continue to upgrade tourism facilities and services to meet local, domestic and international demand. Chengdu has also been at the forefront of reforms and opening-up of western China. The city’s GDP passed 1 trillion yuan (£104 billion) last year, 8.9 per cent higher than in 2013. The local statistics bureau said foreign investment in the city hit $10 billion (£6.4 billion) last year. As an exceptionally large city in Southwest China, it is located at the intersection of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the Yangtze River Economic Belt. The Belt and Road Initiative is expected to reach 4.4 billion people, 63 per cent, or almost two-thirds of the world’s population, with a collective GDP of $21 trillion, or 29 per cent of the world’s GDP. Since the launch of the Chengdu-Europe express railway in April 2013, commodities worth $580 million have been exported from Chengdu to Europe. The line is an artery for economic exchanges between the continents of Asia and Europe and influences the development of China’s western region, Europe and Russia. “Since the opening of the Chengdu-Europe Express Rail Service, wide-ranging mutual co-operation between the two countries at both ends of the railway has greatly increased,” said Katarzyna Kacperczyk, Poland’s deputy foreign minister. Chengdu is the fourth city where Poland offers consular services in China, following Shanghai, Guangzhou in Guangdong province and Hong Kong. It is also the first city in western China to adopt the 72-hour visa-free policy, which allows passengers from 51 countries to spend three days in the city if they have valid third-country visas and flight tickets to onward destinations.
