Stephanopoulos apologized, saying that he should have disclosed to viewers and to ABC that he had contributed $75,000 to the foundation over three years.\nBut some Republicans howled. They called the donations a conflict of interest, particularly since Hillary Rodham Clinton is the leading Democratic candidate and because Stephanopoulos served as a presidential adviser and top aide to Bill Clinton before joining ABC News in 1997. Republicans such as Sens. Rand Paul (Ky.) and Mike Lee (Utah) questioned whether Stephanopoulos could be neutral and objective during the presidential campaign.\nBut those concerns appear to have been quickly forgotten. They certainly haven’t come up in the many interviews Stephanopoulos has conducted with Republicans since the donation flap arose.\nIn the weeks since the story flared, most of the Republican candidates have appeared on Stephanopoulos’s Sunday show, “This Week with George Stephanopoulos.” The list includes Rick Santorum, Ben Carson, Scott Walker, Carly Fiorina, Bobby Jindal, Mike Huckabee and Rick Perry. His guest on Sunday was Donald Trump, the GOP front-runner. However, Paul, who is also running, has not appeared on the program.\n[ Is Stephanopoulos controversy like Bill O’Reilly’s or Brian Williams’s? ]\nAt the same time, the controversy doesn’t appear to have dissuaded viewers. “This Week” still finishes­ behind ratings leader “Face the Nation” among all viewers, but it has been the most watched Sunday-morning public-affairs show for seven straight weeks among those ages 25-54, the most coveted audience for advertisers on news programs.\nThe ratings may help explain why some Republicans seem to have shrugged off any concerns about Stephanopoulos, said Tim Graham , director of media analysis at the Media Research Center , a watchdog group based in Reston, Va.\nWith a field of 16 Republican candidates, most are eager for any national television attention, Graham said. “You might suggest that those voters who have never trusted him because of his Clinton connections were the only ones who will remember” this controversy, he said. “But other journalists with close ties to presidents have labored to develop an image of independence. I don’t think Stephanopoulos ever has.”\nABC News spokeswoman Heather Riley sees it differently. In a statement, she said it was “great” that viewers and guests were continuing to come to Stephanopoulos’s show “for smart and fair interviews.” She offered no direct comment on the donation controversy.\nRiley said that Stephanopoulos was unavailable for comment Tuesday because he was busy interviewing Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the latest Republican to jump into the presidential race.\nStephanopoulos has already made one concession to accusations of bias from conservatives: During the donation controversy, he said that he would recuse himself from moderating an ABC News-sponsored debate of Republican candidates in February. But it wasn’t clear whether his recusal was prompted by the donation issue or by earlier criticism from Republicans about his questioning of Mitt Romney in a Republican primary debate in 2012.\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in May that he objected to Stephanopoulos’s return as a GOP debate moderator. “How can I as chairman of the national party have the former employee of the Clintons, who’s running on the other side, be the person on the stage deposing our candidate?” he said on Fox News. “This was a done deal as far as I was concerned.”\nPresidential scholar Kathleen Hall Jamieson applauded Stephanopoulos’s recusal from the debate because, she said, questions about his impartiality and fairness would have been a distraction from the event.\nBut Jamieson said the same issues aren’t as prominent in his role as host of “This Week.” Unlike a debate, “if reporters write about Sunday show interviews at all, the focus on the host is unlikely and, if it occurs, is of little consequence to the reader,” she said. What’s more, candidates can choose to forgo a Sunday show; they can’t skip the debates, she said.\nThe mild Republican reaction to Stephanopoulos’s involvement with the Clinton Foundation “isn’t very surprising,” said Matthew Continetti , editor in chief of the Washington Free Beacon , the publication that first raised the contributions issue with ABC. “Most of the people who would be upset about this don’t watch ‘Good Morning America’ or ABC in the first place,” he said. “They’ve given up on most establishment media anchors.”\nUnlike Brian Williams, the NBC News anchor who was suspended for exaggerating his reporting experiences, Stephanopoulos is a well-liked figure in media and political circles and “has a lot of friends on the Republican side,” Continetti said.\nBut the issue shouldn’t be framed as just a Republican one, he added. Given Hillary Clinton’s presence in the Democratic field, Continetti said, “I’m surprised [Democratic candidates] Bernie Sanders, Jim Webb, Martin O’Malley and Lincoln Chafee didn’t raise any objections” to Stephanopoulos’s contributions.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@farhip", "http://www.mrc.org/", "http://archive.mrc.org/bios/graham/welcome.asp", "http://freebeacon.com/author/matt/", "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2012/02/14/paid-democratic-hitman-stephanopoulos-bizarre-debate-question-suddenly-makes-much-more-sense/", "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/05/14/rand-paul-stephanopoulos-shouldnt-moderate-2016-debates/?_r=0", "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/stephanopoulos-clinton-foundation-republican-presidential/2015/05/14/id/644750/", "https://www.leeforsenate.com/videos/fox-news-mike-lee-questions-george-stephanopoulos-objectivity/", "http://abcnews.go.com/Press_Release/week-ranks-adults-25-54-seventh-consecutive-week/story?id=32493590", "http://freebeacon.com/"], "published": "2015-07-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T02:38:36.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
