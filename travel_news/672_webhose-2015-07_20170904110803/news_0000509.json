I was born and brought up in the north of England and we went to Norfolk when I was seven or eight. I can remember everything about that holiday: the smell of the sea, the seaweed, the rocks – just seeing the sea for the first time was fantastic. I don't think I've ever had such an exciting experience, really. \nAND THE BEST HOTEL YOU'VE STAYED IN? \nIt wasn't a big hotel, but it was in the Torres del Paine national park in Chilean Patagonia. It's a wonderful, wild landscape there, all rugged peaks and glaciers. Anyway, there was a little place with a few cabins and they had this fantastic 20-year-old whisky and if you wanted ice, you had to go outside and chop off your own bit of ice from the glacier. So you had 20-year-old whisky paired with 20,000 year old ice. \nWHAT DO YOU ALWAYS TAKE WITH YOU? \nA notebook – that's number one. Even if I'm not doing a series, I always try to remember what I've seen, and a notebook is much more important than a camera for me. It's not written out like a piece of prose, just my impressions here and there. I keep them all, I even have the notebook from my first trip to Australia many years ago. \nWHAT DO YOU NEED FOR A PERFECT HOLIDAY? \nI think you need to clear your mind before you go. I need peace of mind while I'm away, which means making sure that you take care of all outstanding work and chores before you go. Also, coming from London, sunshine is high on the list of priorities. \nWHAT'S YOUR BEST PIECE OF TRAVEL ADVICE? Ad Feedback \nUse every journey to learn something for yourself. Any way you can have some contact with a local is important. When I travel, I don't just want to look at a ruin or eat a particular food, I want to find out something about the people and why the country is the way it is. \nAND YOUR WORST EXPERIENCE ON HOLIDAY? \nI think it was probably a trip with the children to Tobago. As soon as we arrived they went to the beach and promptly returned a few minutes later crying, \"The sand's black, Dad!\". I thought Tobago was a lovely place, but obviously the volcanic sand wasn't to their liking! \nWHAT IS THE BIGGEST PACKING MISTAKE YOU'VE MADE? \nTo spend ages packing and then forget the one vital thing you really need. Thankfully, I'm quite good at packing now; I had to be because of all the journeys I've done. My trick is to just take six of everything: six shirts, six pairs of underpants, six pairs of socks etcetera. If you do that every time, then you know that something's missing. Standardise your packing, that's my boring tip. \nWHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO NEXT? \nI think about this all the time. I've been to Kolkata a couple of times and visually it's so amazing and intellectually it's fantastic. It involves all your senses. I'd like to get to know it a bit more and perhaps even do a show there, but don't quote me on that. \nFor more information on Michael Palin and his travels see palinstravels.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T04:15:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
