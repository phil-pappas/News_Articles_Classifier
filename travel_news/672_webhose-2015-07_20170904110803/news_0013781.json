The consumer position was represented by Flyers Rights, the National Consumers' League, and Travelers United. Charles Leocha of Travelers United invited me to participate, and as a participant, I can report cautious optimism on both issues.\nExcessive Change Fees. Typically, on the three giant legacy lines, if you unexpectedly have to cancel a nonrefundable air ticket -- the kind most consumers use -- you can retain some of the ticket's value, but only after paying a hefty exchange fee. Fees are typically $200 for domestic travel or $300 for an international ticket, but they can go as high as $700 in some cases.\n-- The current government position is that the Airline Deregulation Act allows airlines to set fees at whatever level they want. Although the DOT retains the authority to require that fees for international tickets be \"reasonable,\" it so far has declined to exercise this authority.\nc Comments Got something to say? Start the conversation and be the first to comment. Add a comment 0 -- The current airline position is to assert, with some validity, that nonrefundable tickets allow them to keep fares low. But they fail to address the claim that current fee levels are excessive, and their recommendation to consumers remains what I call the \"Marie Antoinette\" position: \"Let them buy nonrefundable tickets\" that cost 3-1/2 times as much.\n-- Consumer advocates want a reasonable cap on fees: Flyers Rights suggests $100 and has called for action in a formal Petition for Rulemaking.\nDeceptive Hotel Pricing. Hotels in popular tourist areas -- especially Florida, Hawaii, and Las Vegas -- routinely carve out part of the full room rate, post the resulting low-ball figure as the rate, then add the carved-out portion back in as a mandatory \"resort\" fee. Although the DOT has no authority to regulate hotel pricing, as such, its current rules say that airlines must include all taxes and fees in any packages that include air travel. But they do not include hotel fees in air/hotel package prices; instead, hotels collect them from travelers on arrival or departure, and airlines now generally disclose them. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has authority to regulate hotel fees, but so far is doing nothing more than advising hotels to disclose mandatory fees adequately before purchase.\n-- The current DOT position is that its all-up pricing rule applies only to payments that a travel seller -- airline or travel agent -- actually collects, and because the consumer's payment to the travel seller does not include the fees, sellers need not incorporate them in the total posted price. The FTC position is that although the practice represents a problem, it is not per se deceptive, a threshold necessary for broad-scale action.\n-- The hotel position is to justify the fee by featuring all the services and features the hotels claim the fees cover.\n-- The consumer position on any such fee is \"If it's mandatory, it's part of the price\" and that disclosure is an inadequate remedy. The laundry list of services fees are supposed to cover is a smokescreen; an excuse, not a reason. Moreover, precedents at FTC and in state actions demonstrate that the practice is, in fact, deceptive per se. And as to why DOT should get involved in the case of air/hotel packages, although travel sellers don't collect the fees, they do obligate consumers to pay the fees at the time of purchase. I submitted a Petition for Rulemaking on this issue in 2013.\nWhat Happens Next. The ACACP committee will meet, consider the evidence and testimony, and make recommendations to the Secretary of Transportation. Although nobody made any commitments, we consumer advocates came away from the meeting believing that some action on both excessive fees and deceptive hotel pricing may be forthcoming.\nOn the hotel pricing issue, we also believe that our submissions may have motivated the FTC a bit; moreover, we may see some action at the state level. All in all, \"cautious optimism\" is the current watchword.\nThe meeting also examined the current muddled situation on checked baggage, which I will cover next week.\n(Send e-mail to Ed Perkins at eperkins@mind.net .
