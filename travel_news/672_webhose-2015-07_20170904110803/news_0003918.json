TAT and THAI are both celebrating their 55th anniversary this year.\nThe activity forms part of THAI’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects to integrate social activities with business operations. THAI first organised a similar educational tour for Thai children and teenagers in 2003, and this year marks the seventh edition as well as the first time that it was held in partnership with TAT.\nMr. Sugree Sithivanich, TAT’s Deputy Governor for Marketing Communications said, “TAT has long admired THAI for their initiative in organising this educational tour for Thai youths. This year, we are joining THAI to host the project as we’d also like to offer the chance for Thai youths to learn the various aspects of the country by visiting places of historical significance. We believe that this will help instill the love in Thai cultural heritage and inspire them to become proud of being Thai and lead them towards being good hosts in the future.”\nTAT helped in selecting 100 underprivileged children and teenagers, aged between 12-15 years, with impressive education records, good behaviour and good health. Participants came from various schools, including Lamphun’s Chalerm Prakiat 48th Year School under the Royal Patronage of Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, Phuket’s Plook Panya School under the Royal Patronage of Princess Petcharat Ratchasuda Sirisopa Punnawadee, Phuket’s Tesaban Ban Bang Niew School, Phuket’s Ban Bang Thong School, and Phang-nga’s Ban Lam Kaen School.\nAs for the educational tour activities, TAT led all participating children and teenagers to visit the Grand Palace where they also had the chance to pay homage to the Emerald Buddha before continuing their trip to the Rattanakosin Exhibition Hall, Ratchdamnoen Contemporary Art Centre, the Golden Mount (Wat Saket Ratcha Wora Maha Wihan), and the Royal Chitralada Projects as well as to learn about the ecosystem at Sea Life Bangkok Ocean World.\nPrior to the ‘discover Thainess’ trip with TAT, all the 100 participants also had the opportunity to marvel at Southeast Asia’s largest aircraft maintenance hangar, which is under the supervision of THAI’s Technical Department.\nMr. Jarumporn Chotikasathien, THAI’s Managing Director said, “As the national carrier, THAI has realised the importance of youths as the valuable human resources of society, and the company wants to be a part that helps children and teenagers to get outside classroom education by offering them the chance to travel on the plane and get them inspired, so that they have more choices for their future careers, grow up to be quality personnel, and be essential human resources for the country’s development in the future.”\nSource:- TAT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T22:12:25.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
