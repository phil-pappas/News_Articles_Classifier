Saying it would be is simply not true.”\nHe said the airport averaged 55 flights a day — not 80 — and 50 used the southern ­approach, meaning an average of only five a day would use the northern approach.\nThe ILS would operate from the northern runways meaning southern flights would ­actually have to fly further if they were to use the system.\n“That means more fuel and the flight will be late so there is a huge disincentive to use the ILS unless it is a matter of safety,” he said.\n“It has been a very slick campaign, obviously pushed by people who are skilled and well resourced financially.\n“We have had people in tears after anti-ILS campaigners doorknocked their home and told them the planes would pass just above their house.\n“The campaigners have been out the front of schools telling people the noise will ­affect their children’s education which again is simply not true.\n“It’s despicable. It’s been a campaign of blatant scaremongering.”\nThe videos have attracted comments like: “Why would anybody want to ruin our beautiful beaches and city with aeroplanes roaring overhead???”\nSome opponents have even compared the impact of the ILS on the Gold Coast with St Maarten island in the Caribbean with its world famous, very low final approach landings passing over a popular beach at the end of the runway.\nBut critics were also quick to respond, with one resident posting: “Stop asking the people. Just install it. Move forward no one will even notice only the whingers with nothing better to do.”\nSubmissions for the proposed ILS closed Monday and the airport has been flooded with thousands of comments.\nMr Collins said results would be systematically processed before a final decision was made.\nThe ILS requires a flight path that is an 18km straight line. All planes could use the flight path from Surfers Paradise to Coolangatta in poor weather, but it would be a last resort.\nLast week, Gold Coast Airport also unveiled a $200 million revamp and expansion of the facility to be substantively completed before the 2018 Commonwealth Games.\nThe prospect of planes roaring over quiet neighbourhoods when using an Instrument Landing System as claimed by opponents to the proposal has been challenged by Gold Coast Airport’s chief operations officer who has labelled their campaign as “deliberately misleading”.\nOriginally published as Airport protest’s ‘scare tactics’", "external_links": ["http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/news/gold-coast/gold-coast-airport-bosses-slam-anti-ils-campaign-tactics-as-blatant-scaremongering/story-fnj94idh-1227445565596", "http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/gold-coast-airport-ils-plan-opposed-by-qantas-jetstar/story-fnihsrf2-1227447093686"], "published": "2015-07-20T00:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T11:48:45.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
