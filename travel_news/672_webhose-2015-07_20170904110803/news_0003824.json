Columbia took the traditional vulcanized shoe design that’s been around for decades via the likes of Vans and PF Flyers and put a whole new spin on it. Unlike those traditional shoes that can leave the soles of your feet hot and sweaty, these Vulc N Vent ones have vents built into the side that let the heat out. \nIt’s a little thing, but it makes a big difference. We’ve been reviewing a few shoes with Gore-tex Surround and although this design isn’t as fancy—it’s not meant to be waterproof since these are untreated canvas—the general idea is the same. All that sweaty hot air underneath the soles of your feet can vent out through the insole and side vents instead of staying trapped there until you take off your shoes. \nThis is not the kind of footwear you take traveling because you’re looking for a lot of features. You won’t go trail hiking in these and there are probably better options for eight hours of walking tours on sidewalks. For casual travel though where you want your feet to stay cool, especially in hot places, these Vulc N Vent shoes are a nice casual option that doesn’t look clunky. \nThese are solid shoes that feel well-made, but they’re not all that heavy: just over a pound for the two of them. They have solid non-marking rubber soles and the vented footbed is comfortable enough that you could wear these all day. They come in five colors, with varying degrees of subtlety when it comes to the lace and vent colors. Sizes range from 7 to 15. \nBesides the lace version pictured at the top, there’s also a loafer version if that’s more your style. Of course with those you get the added advantage of getting through the airport security line a little faster. \nThe Vulc N Vent shoes from Columbia retail for a reasonable $55 and you may find them on sale for less. Get them direct from Columbia or check online at Zappos or Backcountry . \nThere’s also a women’s version in slip-on and lace-up styles. First time here?
