Dublin, Ireland-based Accenture said last week that it would sell the Navitaire business to Amadeus IT Holding of Madrid in a deal worth $830 million. Navitaire, which employs 550 people (about 60 in Minneapolis), will run independently from Amadeus and its management will stay on. The Star Tribune has a follow-up on the deal that goes into Navitaire's roots as as software project launched by Northwest Airlines Corp. and Accenture's predecessor, Andersen Consulting. In the early 1990s, Northwest wanted to create software to handle revenue tracking and ticket imaging; the resulting product, called PRA, was also sold to other airlines and is still used by carriers like Air Canada.
