This is a great new opportunity for hotels to monetize activities that their customers typically require thus offering an enhanced service whilst also driving up revenues.\nHotels can also utilise the platform to upsell activities direct to the customer online. This can happen in a variety of ways – either a customer books a room via the hotels website and then is presented with an array of activities (either on the site or via a link in a post-purchase email). Or, the customer can book a room and activities as part of a bundle pre-trip.\nMusement’s bundling option provides hotels with a simple and effective means of avoiding the issue of parity rates. If a hotel wants to sell a room for less than that advertised via an OTA, they can now reduce the room rate as required and, using the activity bundle option, still respect the parity rates and comply with the booking site’s contract by offering a better package to clients. In this way the hotel can reduce a room rate, the OTA contract is honored and the guest can enjoy a favourably priced travel package.\nSource:-Musement.com\nRelated Posts PROMPERÚ to tap Indian travel market World-Renowned Voices Jet In For Conflict Conference New Urban Adventure in Singapore makes stopover sightseeing easy Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium UK-based tour operator offers weekend trip to other side of planet", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T15:22:08.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
