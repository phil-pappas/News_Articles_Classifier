Senior academics from nine universities met at the Barbican to map a research agenda with the intention of helping to boost the competitiveness of managers working in the industry. \nThis follows ABPCO’s strategic decision to create a new membership category specifically to connect academic research, researchers and professional practice. “Universities are often seen by practitioners only in relation to issues associated with the flow of students to the industry,” comments Rhodri Thomas, Professor of Tourism & Events Policy at Leeds Beckett University. “That’s important but universities can offer more. A significant volume of research is produced by academics that, if presented appropriately, might prompt practitioners to re-think some of their practices or help them answer some of the questions that challenge them from time-to-time”. ABPCO’s Caroline Windsor introduced the event by stating that gaining access to research produced in universities was one of ABPCO’s five priorities and the links between ABPCO and leading Universities has never been stronger. “We recently undertook a poll of our members and this issue came out top,” said Caroline. “There is a thirst for more knowledge and we hope that this collaboration will help create a flow of useful research to help quench it”. A finalised subject for the research will now be decided upon based on the needs and wants of the industry following this initial meeting.
