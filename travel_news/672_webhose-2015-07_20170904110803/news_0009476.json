I think there’s a lot of hurdles, but I’m of the full belief that you put everything in or you put nothing in.\n“I love footy, I love trying to develop people ... I would certainly talk to him [ Adelaide CEO Andrew Fagan ].”\nMalthouse was sensationally sacked by Carlton in May after the Blues disastrous 1-7 start to the season.\nBut Bartlett believes Malthouse “ticks all the boxes” to coach Adelaide.\n“Malthouse has the experience as the game’s longest serving coach to again give Adelaide the direction, confidence, standing and culture the club strives for,” Bartlett said on SEN 1116.\n“It’s going to be a tough gig taking over from the much-loved Walsh on a full-time basis.\n“They (Adelaide) need someone with extraordinary skills of leading men and Malthouse ticks all the boxes as a three-time premiership coach.”\nHawthorn assistant coach Brendon Bolton is considered a frontrunner for both the Adelaide and Carlton senior coaching positions.\nWest Coast premiership coach John Worsfold, appointed Adelaide coaching director following the death of Walsh, also remains in contention.\nMalthouse will be in Adelaide next month for a sportsman’s night at Central Districts Football Club.\nOriginally published as Mick: I wouldn’t rule out a move to Adelaide", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/mick-malthouse-wants-to-coach-again-not-ruling-out-move-to-adelaide-football-club/story-fni5f4l8-1227460805582"], "published": "2015-07-29T08:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T07:38:41.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
