It’s addressed to one Thomas Machell, and tells him how much the city has changed since he was first there. Machell, by then, had been dead for nearly 140 years. In Deeper than Indigo, Jenny Balfour Paul performs something of a resurrection. Travelogue, memoir, history, detective story, love story – her book is partly each of these, and wholly compelling. \nAt the end of 1999, Balfour Paul, who had established herself as one of the world’s experts on indigo, was preparing to deliver the first lecture of the new millennium at the Royal Geographical Society in London on her travels in pursuit of dye and dyers when she was tipped off about an obscure manuscript in the British Library written by a Victorian, described as a “midshipman in the merchant navy and indigo planter”. \n• Which locations from famous novels do you know? \nIt turned out to be one of five volumes, totalling almost 3,000 pages, chronicling Machell’s travels and expat life – though their author had predicted he would write seven, and expressed the hope that they would be “lighted upon in some musty library in the 20th century and quoted by some descendant”. \nBalfour Paul didn’t qualify as a descendant, but she felt their meeting was somehow predestined. They had indigo, diary-keeping and wanderlust in common. In what he called his “Talking Papers”, originally addressed to his father, she felt he was striking up a new conversation with her a century and a half on. By February 2000 she was setting off with her husband on the Machell trail, and acknowledging that her marriage “now seems to include a third person”. Ten years on, with her husband dead, she would still be keeping company with a very unusual Victorian. \nMachell, the son of a clergyman in Beverley, Yorkshire, in 1824, was clearly hardier than three of his siblings, who died in infancy, but considered a runt among the surviving nine. A limp made him unfit for the military (unlike his younger brother, Lancelot, who would become “one of the best riders in the Punjab”) and he was expected to stay at home and be a clerk. At 12, however, he abseiled from his bedroom window, Lancelot dogging his heels, and the two got as far as Brighton before being returned to their anxious parents. \nAs a teenager, he sailed to India then China, where he witnessed the First Opium War and the signing of the Treaty of Nanking. He went around Cape Horn on a ship carrying coal and guano to the Marquesas Islands of Polynesia, where he had a passionate affair with a “nut-brown maiden of the sea”, the daughter of a cannibal chieftain. Returning to India, he worked in indigo in Bengal, coffee in Kerala, and bullock transport in the centre of the country. All the while – even when the house was so full of grasshoppers that they filled his nose and got impaled on his pen – he scribbled his journals, sprinkled with whimsical watercolours, and posted them home, along with specimens of the local wildlife, among them a hooded cobra bottled while still alive. \n• The best books about flying \nMachell was far from an imperialist. “The White man,” he wrote, “is not the regenerator but the annihilator of the uncivilised races, he brings no blessing to the savage.” He was ahead of his time in his concern for virgin forest felled to make way for coffee bushes: “…one cannot help a feeling of regret that those splendid trees should be cut down and burnt like so many useless weeds and rubbish”. And he was homesick, and nagged by a feeling that he hadn’t done anything “useful”. \nBalfour Paul, who describes herself as Machell’s “besotted admirer”, thinks her travels pale beside his, but it turns out that in following indigo dyers she had herself smuggled into Oman, where visiting women were unwelcome, and was shot at in Yemen. She’s similarly determined in her pursuit of Machell, and aided by coincidences worthy of Dickens. When, for example, she wants to visit an obscure town where Machell lived, Jessore (now in Bangladesh), she discovers that friends of hers, development workers, happen to be stationed there at just the right time. \nWhat take longest to clear up are questions over whether her subject wrote more diaries and where he was buried in 1862. In her efforts to answer them, Balfour Paul risks her reputation as an academic with an assertion that Machell, the man who began by speaking to her, went on to speak through her. Whether he did or he didn’t, she makes him live on the page. Travel books of the week Channel Shore: From the White Cliffs to Land’s End \nBy Tom Fort (Simon and Schuster, £14.99) \nHaving driven from Hampshire to the Cornish Riviera for his bestseller The A303, Tom Fort swaps car for bike to travel along the edge of the Channel . Why, he wants to know, do so many choose to live within sight and sound of it? Between St Margaret’s Bay in Kent and Land’s End, he chats to anyone who will give him the time of day. He draws on the literature of the coast as it was, sees for himself how it is, and hears the mad schemes of numerous planners on how it ought to be. Reflecting on how far he’s come from Dover, he says: “I had not solved any great mysteries nor uncovered any startling truths.” But he doesn’t need to; an eye for oddity and eccentricity and a gentle wit take him a long way. “You can never get bored by the sea,” he’s told by a couple of pensioners in Bexhill. They might have been talking about Fort himself. \nAvailable from Telegraph Books (0844 871 1514; books.telegraph.co.uk ) at £12.99 plus £1.99 p&p. Coming into the Country: Travels in Alaska \nBy John McPhee (Daunt Books, £10.99) \nDaunt Books is not just one of the best travel bookshops in London; it is also a publisher in a small way, dedicated to introducing works by fresh voices or reissuing lost classics. \nThis, by the Pulitzer Prize-winning McPhee, falls into the latter category, having been published in Britain in 1977, the year the first barrel of oil was taken from what he calls “America’s ultimate wilderness”. It began life as a series for The New Yorker and is really three books in one: the story of a river journey McPhee made in 1975; an exploration of “urban” Alaska; and sketches of the locals – from American Indians to oil drillers – who had “come into the country” around the town of Eagle. In 2015, as Robert Macfarlane puts it in his introduction, it reads “like a combination of prophecy and elegy”. \nAvailable from Telegraph Books (0844 871 1514; books.telegraph.co.uk ) at £9.99 plus £1.99 p&p. 1519: A Journey to the End of Time \nBy John Harrison (Parthian, £10.99) \nWhen the Spanish met the Mayans and the Aztecs in 1519, both sides believed they were running out of time. The latter, who saw life in cycles, thought they were living in the final one. Many of the former believed Christ’s millennium was approaching, and that their last duty was the conversion of the natives of the New World. John Harrison spent four months travelling through Mexico in the footsteps of the conquistadors and the people whose land they invaded. He did it while dealing with an invader of his own: throat cancer. In this brave and beautifully written book, he combines travel, history and a meditation on mortality. He also confounds his doctors. When, according to the best medical opinion, he should be six feet under, he joins in festivities marking the Day of the Dead. \nAvailable from Telegraph Books (0844 871 1514; books.telegraph.co.uk ) at £10.99 plus £9.99 p&p. The Saffron Road: A Journey With Buddha’s Daughters \nBy Christine Toomey (Portobello, £14.99) \nAn encounter in India with a Buddhist nun who had been jailed and tortured in Tibet prompted Christine Toomey – a foreign correspondent of 25 years who has documented the suffering of women – to explore the lives of Buddhist nuns throughout the world and their motivations for entering holy orders. Along the way she met nuns in Nepal who seek spiritual empowerment in kung-fu, Switzerland’s first female commercial pilot and a former catwalk model in Paris. “In a world numbed by the amount of attention paid to violence, terrorism and political and religious power struggles,” she writes, “I find it profoundly refreshing to come across women whose lives are dedicated to nurturing the opposite.” So will her readers. \nAvailable from Telegraph Books (0844 871 1514; books.telegraph.co.uk ) at £12.99 plus £1.99 p&p.
