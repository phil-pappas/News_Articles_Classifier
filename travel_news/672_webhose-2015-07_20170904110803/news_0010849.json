What's driving it, economics or culture? \nSoon after graduating from high school in the 1970s, I couldn’t wait to get my own place (if only there had been apodments then!). This was a near universal sentiment shared among baby boomers. \nOne’s own apartment meant freedom and adulthood (back then a coveted status). Our stodgy parents certainly wouldn’t have allowed us to bring a girlfriend or boyfriend home overnight (nor, ick, would we have wanted to do so). Rebelling by moving out seemed a right-of-passage. \nThat arrangement has been changing for some time, but this week’s report from the Pew Research Center shows that more young adults aged 18 to 34 are likely to be living with their parents than during the Great Recession. Sixty-seven percent of young adults were living independently this year compared with 71 percent in the initial years of the downturn. \nThe reason this matters for the economy is that new household formation helps drive spending.
