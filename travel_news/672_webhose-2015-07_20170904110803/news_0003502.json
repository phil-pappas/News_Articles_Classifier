Users click on photos of looks they want to recreate in a home, and Zillow provides a cost estimate for materials and labor, along with links to advertisers who sell those goods and services.\nThe suit, filed Thursday in federal court in Seattle, alleges that Zillow discussed with VHT the possibility of licensing its photographs for use on the Digs site, but never did so. VHT alleges that Zillow has a limited license to use its photographs only in listings for homes for sale.\nMost Read Stories How Edgar Martinez is already making Mariners hitters better Traffic death of boy stirs outcry in Issaquah The jury’s in: ‘True Detective’ Season 2 is not so hot Mount St. Helens, still steaming, holds the world’s newest glacier Bush’s 'work longer hours’ remark may follow him for a long time In a statement, Zillow said it “has abided by the terms of the licenses agreed to by the parties who provided these photos.” The company said that it respects copyright protections but “will vigorously fight the allegations” made in the suit.\nVHT said it serves more than 75,000 real estate agents. It claims the nation’s largest database of residential photographs, with more than 4 million unique images of home interiors and exteriors.\n“The more interesting thing here will be the broader issue on how photographs are disseminated on the Internet and attempts by photographers to control that,” said Margaret Esquenet, a copyright lawyer at Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett & Dunner in Washington, D.C. “What are the rights of licensees? Are the licensees needing broader rights than they’re getting?”\nVHT alleges that after it complained in writing to Zillow in mid-2014 about the photos on Digs, Zillow began encouraging users on its home listings site to add the photographs themselves to the Digs site, where Zillow tags objects in the images and links them to advertisements.\n“Zillow cannot hide behind safe harbors and blame others for its own brazen theft,” VHT said in the lawsuit.\nWhile VHT did not say how much it seeks in damages, it did say it found at least 316 of its images used without authorization on Zillow Digs. It also said that VHT’s customers pay between $10 and $100 per photograph.\nSanjay Bhatt: 206-464-3103 or sbhatt@seattletimes.com .
