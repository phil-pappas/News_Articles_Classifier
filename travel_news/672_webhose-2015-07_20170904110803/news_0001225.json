Bodega Bay is 115 miles and about 2.5 hours from Stockton. » Social News Shorebirds, sea lions, quaint towns and spectacular Pacific coastal scenery — just 2.5 hours from San Joaquin County! With arguably the most scenic stretch of California coastline and late summer/early fall the best time of the year to visit, the coast from Bodega Bay north to Mendocino is too close not to make it a near-term destination. It’s relatively undiscovered even in the busiest of vacation months, so leave the crowds behind and enter a world where time moves a bit slower. We have been there numerous times, on both day trips, extended camping trips, with a few motel overnights thrown in for diversity. This piece of California offers impressive vistas, spectacular food, great camping options and wonderful places to stop for the night, if you aren’t into camping. Recently, we headed northwest with our Scotty teardrop trailer in tow. Bodega (the town is different than Bodega Bay) was our first stop, just off Highway 116 west of Santa Rosa, and offers the old school where portions of the 1963 Hitchcock classic movie \"The Birds\" was filmed (rent the movie to view that night). This cute little town is worth the short detour, for both the quaintness of the town and the cinematic history. Just six miles north, one reaches Bodega Bay (also appearing in Hitchcock’s film), on the water, home to a variety of fine restaurants and several nearby beautiful campgrounds. Stop at the Tides Restaurant for delicious breakfasts or lunches, and check out a myriad of state parks for tenting or trailering options. Our favorite campground, Wright's Beach State Park, between Bodega Bay and Jenner, offers campsites right on the ocean (reserve well in advance, through reserveamerica.com). Heading north on Highway 1, one soon crosses the languid Russian River and reaches the cute town of Jenner, where the Russian River spills into the Pacific. Stop at River's End Restaurant for great food and stunning views; looking down from their deck above the river, a cadre of harbor seals usually is visible sunning themselves on a sandy spit (the restaurant offers a telescope for a closer view). Shorebirds are also visible and swoop through the air off the restaurant deck. If you have the time, detour off Highway 1, up the Russian River to Guerneville, the unofficial river headquarters with plenty of shops, restaurants, river-floating options and overnight accommodations. Returning to the coast just north of Jenner, one soon reaches Ft. Ross, the old Russian settlement active from 1812 to 1841. The fort was Russia’s southernmost outpost in its attempt to colonize North America, and functioned as an agricultural base, a center for shipbuilding and was the site of California’s first windmills. The Rotchev House remains from the 1830s, with the balance of the fort, stockade, blockhouses and chapel all reconstructed as original, now a part of Ft. Ross State Historic Park. Take the kids to get a feel for early settlements on the rugged California coast; docents lend an air of historical authenticity and hands-on experience. A favorite campground, where you can camp on a bluff above the ocean, is Ocean Cove Campground. It’s a private campground and store, with stunning scenery, fishing and snorkeling right at your doorstep, with reasonable pricing from primitive but scenic campsites. Pressing north up Highway 1, stop at the Stewart’s Point General Store, for a snack and drink and admire an historic outpost that looks much as it did almost 100 years ago. Just north is Salt Point State Park, where American Indians once gathered salt that was captured in depressions on the ocean’s rocky outcroppings; hiking and birding and watching for sea lions is the attraction. Pretty campsites on a bluff over the Pacific can fetch late afternoon winds that can level a tent … beware! Traveling north, several cute coastal towns like Sea Ranch (stop at the Sea Ranch Lodge for breakfast or lunch and spectacular, if pricey, overnight accommodations) and Gualala (Bones Roadhouse offers a fine lunch choice of barbecue or fish dishes) offer neighborly stops. Gualala County Regional Park just south of Gualala offers very pretty and secluded campsites. As you continue up Highway 1, take the detour two miles off Highway 1 to check out and tour the Point Arena Lighthouse, for stunning coastal views. Some of my best coastal photos were shot looking north along the rugged coast with the old lighthouse as the backdrop. Further north, one passes through Manchester, then Elk, Albion, and into Mendocino. Mendocino is the quintessential California coastal town, with trendy shops and several restaurants. It’s old main drag is on a bluff overlooking the crashing Pacific below. Don't miss Mendocino Headwaters State Park, just west of town for superb ocean views and rocky bluffs. If you are camping, Van Damme State Park is just south of the city, with secluded campsites in a deep riparian forest, and the ocean beach is just steps away, including kayak rentals. Ft. Bragg is just north of Mendocino, if you have time to extend your journey on the gorgeous California coast.
