The camera has 15 lenses, each pointed in a different direction to create a 360-degree panoramic view.\nGoogle Trekker footage allows viewers to go on a personalised virtual trek with the viewer deciding which path to take and which direction to look.\nGoogle Maps Australia and New Zealand Product Manager Andrew Foster said by loaning Street View Trekker to organisations like Tourism NT, they were able to share Australia’s diverse landscapes with the world.\n“Whether you’re planning your next adventure through Kakadu or simply a digital explorer relaxing on your own couch, you’ll soon be able to take a virtual trip to some of the Northern Territory’s most iconic landmarks on Google Maps,” Mr Foster said.\nTourism NT employee Chris Frankenfeld, who helped travel the Territory with the Google Trekker, said the equipment weighed about 18kgs and had tested his endurance in the warm weather.\n“The hardest part was traversing steep terrain such as Gunlom Falls and Wangi as the Google Trekker should be kept upright at all times,” Mr Frankenfeld said.\n“Some of the step ups were tricky and you have to keep in mind not to get yourself in the frame, such as when reaching out to grab hold of a tree.”\nThe Google Trekker project follows the successful launch of Tourism NT’s innovative Virtual Journeys website, which allows travel agents to experience the Northern Territory through over 200 online videos filmed using first person perspective technology.\nRelated Posts TripAdvisor touches mark of 100 million downloads for free app for iPhone and Android Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium Sabre developing travel services for emerging wearable technology Critical storm alert in Queensland’s coastline", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T18:07:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
