We do not expect 2015 to be a stellar year, however our low unit cost and expanded network will allow us to take full advantage of market recovery when it comes.”\nAir Astana recently concluded an agreement with for seven Airbus 320 family NEOs, including 4 A321 Long Range aircraft, to be delivered from 2016.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-07-20T17:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T21:34:16.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
