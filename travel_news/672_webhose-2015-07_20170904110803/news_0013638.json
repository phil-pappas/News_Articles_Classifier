The normal average high during the month is around 29.4 C (85.0 F). \nWith the arrival of slightly cooler air from the north, the high is expected to be around 32 C (89 F) both Friday and Saturday. This would be the coolest day since the middle of June. Along with the cooler air the front will spark showers and thunderstorms across northern and central Spain on Friday. \nCordoba will also feel this cool down with daytime high temperatures ranging from 34-35 C (93-95 F) on Friday and Saturday. While the cooler air will reach Cordoba and southern Spain, no rainfall is expected from the frontal passage. \nThis front will also bring cooler air and thunderstorms to northern Italy. Showers and thunderstorms will rumble through Milan on Thursday as the cooler air arrives. The high temperature is expected to be around 28 C (82 F) through Saturday. \nAcross the Balkan Peninsula the worst of the heat will end, though temperatures will remain above normal across the region much of the time though Sunday. \nA ridge of high pressure will build back over southern Europe bringing another round of extreme heat from Spain to the Balkan Peninsula next week. \nMeanwhile, comfortable conditions will prevail from southern parts of the United Kingdom into France and Germany through this weekend. \nDays will feature partly to mostly sunny skies with seasonable temperatures and little to no rainfall. \nA cold front will cross northern Europe early next week bringing rainfall and another shot of cool air.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T03:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T02:59:26.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
