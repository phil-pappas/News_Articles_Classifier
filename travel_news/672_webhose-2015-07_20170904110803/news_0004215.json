(John Jay Cabuay) July 17 at 1:10 PM There is no “i” in pop star, but there certainly is one in diva — and in the names of the three women who are headlining big concerts here this week, Ariana Grande, Shania Twain and Nicki Minaj. The hail from different musical genres, representing different decades and three different nations. One had huge sales, but the others boast a much larger presence on social media. (In the 21st century, which is more important?) All are represented by their own scents, and each has spent time as a reality-show judge. All are diminutive. Two have even worked together, with Grande and Minaj teaming up on the hit “Bang Bang” with Jessie J.
