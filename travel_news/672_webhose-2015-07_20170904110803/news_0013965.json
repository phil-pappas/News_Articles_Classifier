The exhibition has brought 22 of these monochromatic works together, the biggest gathering of them in one place, along with others including Summertime: Number 9A (on loan from the Tate Modern). A Jackson Pollock painting at the Tate Liverpool Photo: GETTY “These works clearly shouldn't be written off, as they have been, as mere exercises in gloom, early symptoms of Pollock's decline after his triumphant (alcohol-free) spell in the late Forties,” says The Telegraph’s Alastair Smart. “They actually represent a last hurrah. Proof that, after scaling art's heights, he did have somewhere left to go other than the drinks cabinet.” For those unable to make it to Liverpool, here are more places to see Jackson Pollock’s work and explore his legacy. Cody, Wyoming Jackson Pollock was born in the small Wyoming city of Cody on January 28, 1912. While it doesn’t possess any of his art, it is an interesting destination in its own right. It is named after William Frederick Cody, better known as “Buffalo Bill” , the renowned scout, bison hunter and showman. Much of the town’s tourist attractions revolve around Cody’s Old West heritage, including the Buffalo Bill Historical Centre and the Old Trail Town, containing 25 restored buildings. Cody calls itself the “Rodeo Capital of the World” and hosts nightly events throughout the summer. It is also a good launching point for trips to Yellowstone National Park. • On the trail of Buffalo Bill • 10 places to get a sense of the Wild West Los Angeles, California Pollock stayed just 10 months in Wyoming. The rest of his childhood was spent in a variety of locations in Arizona and South California, depending on where his father found work. He first studied art at Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles. The city’s Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) contains a handful of his paintings, including No. 1, 1949; pictured below. Lucie Young, Telegraph Travel Los Angeles expert, describes the city as “one of the world’s most creative cities”. “Its museums and burgeoning gallery scene have an experimental edge that is often missing in other cultural capitals,” she adds. As well as the MOCA, she advises visiting the Getty Centre, which houses a “world class collection of American and European photographs, European art and furniture”. • Los Angeles city guide New York City The artist moved to New York in 1930, at the age of 18, settling in Greenwich Village and studying at the Art Students League. His first exhibition was at the Brooklyn Museum in 1932. In New York he met Peggy Guggenheim, the niece of Solomon R. Guggenheim, whose eponymous museum opened on Fifth Avenue in 1939. She became a major supporter and gave him his first solo exhibition. New York’s Museum of Modern Art contains numerous works by Pollock, including Autumn Rhythm, Number 30 (pictured above), as does the Guggenheim , including Ocean Greyness (pictured below). “Known the world over as MoMA, the glassy Yoshio Taniguchi-designed Midtown building houses one of the most influential collections of modern art in the world,” says our New York expert Douglas Rogers. “ Van Gogh, Cézanne, Matisse, Magritte, Picasso, Pollock and Warhol are all here. But aside from the painting, sculpture and photography galleries there is also performance art, architecture, design (marvel at the Bell helicopter in the design gallery), and a collection of 22,000 films, with frequent screenings and retrospectives. “The iconic, conch-shell shaped Guggenheim, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, has been drawing contemporary art lovers since it opened in 1959, its unique cylindrical shape a work of art in itself,” he adds. • New York city guide Long Island, New York “It was in 1945 that Pollock - trying to escape the booze and depression tormenting him in Manhattan - moved with his wife Lee Krasner to a tumbledown wood cottage in the East Hampton village of Springs,” explained Douglas Rogers, back in 2007 . “Willem de Kooning soon followed, and for much of the 1950s Springs became the cradle of the Abstract Expressionist art movement, a bohemian enclave of painters, dealers, critics and curators. “The demons eventually caught up with Pollock - he killed himself in a drink-drive crash in Springs in 1956 - but he did his greatest work here and today the Pollock-Krasner House is a museum. Incredibly, little of the house, (as seen in Ed Harris's 2000 film Pollock), or the stunning view of meadow and marsh rolling down to Accabonac Creek, has changed since his time, but more remarkable was the rustic studio out back. Pollock famously painted on his knees, in a kinetic ballet movement, and walking across the paint-splattered studio floor (in slippers provided) you are literally stepping on the paint from his masterpieces.” The artist at work at his studio in Long Island Photo: ALAMY The house is open to visitors from May-October on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. See the website for more information . He also spent the odd summer on Martha’s Vineyard, at friend and fellow painter Thomas Hart Benton's summer home, AND created Seascape (1934) and T.P. Boat's in Menemsha Pond while there. • The Hamptons: open to anyone Venice Closer to home, the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice contains several of Pollock’s works, including Alchemy (pictured below). “Everyone’s favourite eccentric art collector, the redoubtable Peggy Guggenheim, assembled a remarkable yet still intensely personal portofolio of modernist and surrealist art, including major works by Picasso, Magritte, Max Ernst (her husband for a while), Giacometti and Jackson Pollock,” says our Venice expert Anne Hanley. “The display case is equally original: just one storey high, the 18th-century Palazzo Venier dei Leoni on the Grand Canal was never finished by the Venetian family that commissioned it.” • Venice city guide Best of the rest The following museums also contain works by Jackson Pollock. Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Philadelphia Museum of Art; University of Iowa Museum of Art; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Dallas Museum of Art; the New Orleans Museum of Art; the National Gallery of Art, Washington; the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; and the National Gallery of Australia. Jackson Pollock: Blind Spots is at the Tate Liverpool from June 30 – October 18, 2015. Free for Tate Members; Adult £11; Concession £8.25.
