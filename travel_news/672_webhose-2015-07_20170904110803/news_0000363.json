Guests are asked to evaluate everything from reservation, check-in and check-out to food and beverage, hotel services, facilities, cost and fees. \nAnd one of the biggest mitigating factors for driving up rates of satisfaction? Old-fashioned hospitality, says the report. \n“There is a 50 per cent reduction in the average number of problems experienced when staff members greet guests with a smile ‘all the time,’ compared to when guests are only greeted with a smile ‘sometimes.’” \nThe finding flies in the face of the fast-growing trend for digital or automated customer service within the industry, with hotel brands replacing concierges with tablets or kiosks in a bid to show that they’re on the leading edge of technology — a strategy developed to appeal to the coveted Millennial generation and frequent business travellers. \nMeanwhile, another way hotels have been winning the good favour of guests has been to proactively anticipate their needs. \nIn fact, authors credit this service strategy for helping to drive down the number of guests reporting problematic stays by 20 per cent from 2014. \nThe index is based on the responses of 62,000 guests in Canada and the US, who stayed in a North American over the past year. \nThe report also ranked the top-rated hotel brands amongst respondents. In the luxury category, guests who stayed at The Ritz-Carlton reported the highest rates of satisfaction, followed by the Four Seasons and JW Marriott. \nAt the other end of the spectrum, Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham, Red Roof Inn and Howard Johnson Express were given the highest marks in the economy and budget category. \nHere are a few of the top-scoring hotel brands for different categories: \nLuxury: The Ritz-Carlton \nUpper Upscale: Omni Hotels & Resorts \nUpscale: Hyatt Place \nUpper Midscale: Drury Hotels (previously ranked highest in the Midscale segment for 9 consecutive years) \nMidscale: Wingate by Wyndham \nEconomy/Budget: Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham (for a third consecutive year) \nUpper Extended Stay: Homewood Suites by Hilton (for a third consecutive year) \nExtended Stay: Candlewood Suites (for a second consecutive year) — AFP/Relaxnews More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T05:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T06:40:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
