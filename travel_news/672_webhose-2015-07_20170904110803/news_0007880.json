Two huge fires have swept through the Peljesac peninsula this week, forcing evacuation of villages and destroying large areas of olive groves, pine forests and vineyards. The blaze has occasionally cut off the main road and power supplies since it erupted early this week. Hot winds, often changing directions, have hindered efforts to contain the wildfires. Winds on Friday reignited some of the blazes that firefighters had managed to curb after an all-night battle, authorities said. Fires also have swept through the islands of Korcula and Brac and on several other spots amid extremely high summer temperatures. Though backed by planes and helicopters, as well as the military, firefighters were stretched to the limit. \"It's all burning ... if one more fire breaks out who knows what will happen,\" said firefighter Romano Levanat. \"We are doing our best, we have been switching, but we are very tired.\" Also Friday, Croatian police said they have detained an unidentified 24-year-old woman suspected of deliberately setting several small fires on Korcula.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T02:10:02.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
