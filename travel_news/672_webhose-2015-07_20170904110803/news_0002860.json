One of the more newsworthy was the Chancellor’s pledge to have a public sale of the Government’s remaining shares in Lloyds Banking Group. In an attempt to capture some of the spirit of the Eighties when Baroness Thatcher led the first major wave of privatisations – in companies as iconic as British Telecom and British Gas – George Osborne vowed a public sell-off would take place. It was one of those pledges which felt vaguely familiar – having been speculated about for some time. But while it was useful in helping the Conservatives to deliver a feel-good policy ahead of May 7, in reality it may never happen. Late last week, UK Financial Investments – which holds the Government’s stake in Lloyds and in the Royal Bank of Scotland – confirmed that it had sold another 1pc of Lloyds shares, taking its holding to just shy of 15pc for the first time. This is a considerable achievement, given UKFI owned a 43.4pc stake as recently as September 2013. While UKFI initially favoured selling major chunks at once – using a well worn process known as overnight book-building – its latest strategy of drip-feeding shares in to the market appears to be even more successful. At the current rate, UKFI, through Morgan Stanley which is leading this so-called “trading plan”, is disposing of approximately 1pc of Lloyds shares every nine or ten days. Antonio Horta-Osorio, chief executive of Lloyds If this were to continue at the current pace, UKFI could be free of its Lloyds holding by the end of the year. However, because trading volumes are lower in August and in December, the continuation of that pace seems less likely. By the turn of the year, when the trading plan expires, UKFI is likely to still have around a 5-6pc stake in the bank. It could be that the Government decides this is enough to launch a public sale. That stake, at current prices, would be worth approximately £3.7bn, which could be deemed enough to justify the costs of a public offering, costs which have to be borne by the bank itself. But the length of time and amount of work involved in a public offering may lead the Treasury to consider it is best to simply extend the trading plan into 2016, and dispose of the shares that way. A public offer requires a prospectus, which would need to be based on audited numbers, and so the sale could not begin until next spring at the earliest, after Lloyds publishes its 2015 financial results in late February. The other factor which counts against a public offer is that, unlike the Royal Mail or RBS, Lloyds shares are already widely held by the public. In fact, thanks in part to the way the bank we know as Lloyds today was formed, not least the Halifax privatisation in 1997, and its long run as a public company, Lloyds has one of the biggest shareholder bases in Europe. Although a public sale may be symbolic for the Chancellor, he might be better to keep his powder dry for the RBS public offer given he already has a very workable option to rid himself of the taxpayers’ remaining stake in Lloyds. --- On the subject of Lloyds, TSB, its former subsidiary, will this week deliver its first set of numbers since being bought by Spain’s Banco de Sabadell group last month. On Thursday, chief executive Paul Pester will oversee the publication of its results for the six months to June 30. As a result of the takeover, no forecasts are available for the half year. However, what is clear is that, with its new owners behind it, TSB is an increasing force to be reckoned with on the British banking high street. On its initial divestment from Lloyds in June 2014, there were many who felt that TSB had a chance of being a leader of consolidation among the smaller challenger banks. Following the announcement of Sabadell’s intentions earlier this year, some felt that potential was now a thing of the past. But in reality, the takeover means that TSB is in a better position than it was as a standalone entity to consolidate the challenger market. Indeed, at the end of June, following regulatory approval for the deal, Sabadell chairman Josep Oliu described the move as “a milestone that enables us to enter a market with vast opportunities.” Pester went further, referencing his Spanish parent’s “extra firepower”. And that’s the point. Sabadell views the TSB purchase as a form of geographic diversification. Before the deal, only 5pc of its assets were outside Spain. After it, that figure now stands at 22pc. With a stronger balance sheet behind it than TSB had on its own, the bank will be in a better position to take advantage of changes in the sector. Those include organic changes, such as leverage to be able to attract more customers through its doors, both retail and small business, as well as acquisitions. Given the increasing plethora of challenger banks in the UK, at some point in the near future, consolidation will have to take place – the economics of so many small banks just doesn’t stack up in the long-term. When that time comes, TSB is now in a good place to lead from the front, rather than be one of the hunted.
