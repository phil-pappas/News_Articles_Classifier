A Unite spokesperson told the newspaper that preparations were being made to give easyJet the seven days notice required, but there was still the opportunity to return to the table for talks to continue. \nThe airline has said it will go ahead with a pay award to staff of a 4.1% rise and 5.1% for cabin managers over the next two years, despite this being rejected by union members. \n“We believe it is right to make the award now since cabin crew, the majority of which are not union members, have been waiting for a conclusion to the pay discussions for a number of months,” the airline said. \n“EasyJet is disappointed that in a recent Unite pay ballot members voted to reject the offer however we note that the majority of easyJet’s cabin crew are not members of Unite and we estimate that only one in five of easyJet’s UK cabin crew voted against the offer.” Readers' comments (1) Anonymous | Mon, 6 Jul 2015 2:08 pm \nTypical Union only thing of themselves and not the thousands of families who have saved very hard to afford a family holiday. Bet if you stopped one of unites members going on a holiday they would be up in arms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T11:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T14:26:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
