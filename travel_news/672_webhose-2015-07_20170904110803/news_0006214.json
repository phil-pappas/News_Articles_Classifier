Beach holidays were the most popular holiday style for future bookings (33%) followed by city breaks (25%). \nKim Watson, media and marketing manager of the company publishing Gay Times and Diva magazines, said: “This was a real surprise. For many years we’ve carried a lot of advertising and promotion for circuit parties and presumed our audience was very interested in partying but that’s not necessarily so.” \nLGBT travellers are likely to spend far more on holidays than the national average, according to the figures. The survey revealed more than a third (38%) of respondents spend between £1,000-£1,999 per person on their main holiday, versus a reported national average of £860 per person for non-LGBT travellers. \nThe survey was answered by 480 readers of Gay Times and Diva magazines. \nTTG’s first LGBT conference was held at the Roof Gardens in Kensington, in conjunction with conference sponsors WTM and Philippines Airlines, and TTG LGBT Network sponsors Celebrity Cruises, Holiday Extras, Virgin Holidays and Abta.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T14:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T07:16:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
