They enjoyed a fun rivalry, with Jack scoring first on tarponâ€”a 70-pounder. The very next day, Kae one-upped the boy with an 80-pounder. And one day later, Jack landed a 60-pounder, leaving the score at 2-1. They both also caught plenty of bones. Jack put together the cool video mash-up from their trip above. \nBTW, there are still two more Bonefish Bonanzas scheduled for this year, in October and November. The young man got off the mark with this sweet 70-pound tarpon.
