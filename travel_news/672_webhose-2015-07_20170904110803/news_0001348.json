At 4,844sq ft (450sq metres), this six-bedroom residence is now the largest hotel suite in London. Costing from £24,000 a night, it is also one of its most expensive. \nRead more: London's supersuites in pictures \nFor that outlay guests can expect constant pampering. Attentive, intuitive butlers are at their beck and call, an advanced media room caters for parties and additional services, such as having a pianist perform using the suite's white grand piano, can be arranged in a jiffy. \nThe hotel itself is impressive too. A basement pool and busy gym cater to those who wish to keep fit, but it's more fun to spend an evening sampling exceptional cocktails downstairs at Artesian , voted the world's best bar for the last three years in a row, or simply taking a private lift to the executive lounge directly above the suite and spending a lazy day reading the papers and enjoying afternoon tea. \nTo make a reservation call 0207 636 1000 or visit langhamhotels.com/london . \nFor the Telegraph's latest luxury-travel news, reviews, features and galleries, visit telegraph.co.uk/luxurytravel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T00:59:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
