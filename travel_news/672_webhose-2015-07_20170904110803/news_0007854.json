Series on my trip to ARGENTINA - visiting El Calafate and El Chaltén (Province of Santa Cruz) - Patagonia and San Martin de los Andes (Province of Neuquén) - From July 18th to August 7th 2015 - #002 ! Click HERE for a much LARGER VERSION ! Click HERE for the WS VERSION (different level of sharpness / less sharpness) ! MONTE FITZ ROY Y CERRO TORRE - EL CHALTÉN! MOUNTS FITZ ROY AND TORRE - EL CHALTÉN! I rented a car to see those mounts from the road, traveling from EL CALAFATE to EL CHALTÉN and back. However, the weather was terrible (including the worst blowing winds I've ever faced in my life) and I couldn't see them. But I had planned to stay longer in EL CHALTÉN, for some walks and shooting pictures. So I traveled by bus and had the great chance to see those mounts from a certain distance, when the bus driver, fortunately, pulled over. The weather was better and after checking in, I did my first short walk (SENDERO DE LOS CONDORES / TRILHA DOS CONDORES / CONDORS TRAIL) and had some great views from FITZ ROY AND TORRE! Here's one of the views! Unfortunately, I've been for two days in the village and couldn't get out of my room, because weather's been terrible again, with snow, rain and cloudy skies! O well, we cannot win all the time!!! Some picture data:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T06:12:11.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
