Starr fell ill in September. \nThe younger Starr said his father hopes to return to Lambeau Field on Thanksgiving night, when Favre's No. 4 will go up on the stadium's interior facade, joining other retired numbers. \n\"I have my fingers crossed that he'll be there for that ceremony,\" Favre said. \"And Bart Jr., has promised me he's going to be here — we're getting him in tip-top shape — so I'm looking forward to that.\" \nThe younger Starr said his father wants to greet Favre at midfield at that game to give him a hug, and to thank fans for their well-wishes. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T06:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T08:19:56.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
