It announced that \"the destination is very much open for business” and that all its guided programmes to Greece are functioning as planned. \n\nThe statement also pointed out that issues related to currency access “are relevant only to local residents and are not impacting international visitors”. \n\nDynasty Travel Singapore’s director of marketing communications, Alicia Seah, also reported zero impact. \n\n“The peak season for tours to Greece runs from April to October. We will have another 250 travellers to Greece over the next three months,” said Seah. \n\nThat said, Dynasty Travel is keeping a close watch on travel advisories issued by relevant ministries and advises its travellers to “bring sufficient cash as we anticipate that some small shops may not accept credit card payments at this juncture”. \n\nSingapore’s Chan Brothers Travel has also not seen any cancellation or postponement, shared spokesperson Rebecca Chia. \n\n“ We have one group departing in mid-July although new enquiries for Greece will (slow down by now) as its peak holiday season is almost coming to an end,” Chia said. \n\nOver in Malaysia, travel specialists say demand for the historical destination is still strong. \n\nHoliday Tours is maintaining weekly departures to Greece, while Parlo Tours will have two departures this month. \n\nParlo Tours general manager, Kerry Tam, said there have been no cancellations, and operators in Greece are providing support and updates. \n\n“So far, there is no problem,” Tam remarked, adding that the company has also been receiving forward bookings for the September school holidays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T19:14:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
