Here by the jetty at Miami Beach’s southernmost point, locals jog, meditate, swim, paddle, bird-watch and sip coffee.\nCotter starts every day here, doing yoga and, when the ocean’s calm, snorkeling amid rainbow-hued parrotfish and striped pennantfish. Before bicycling to work, she freshens up at South Pointe Park’s wavy open-air shower-towers, changing room and elevated sun deck. Who needs a gym or spa when this place is free and offers spectacular views?\nShe shared some of her locals’ tips with me. Insiders know that South Beach’s finest pleasures lie beyond nightclubs. Their favorites have become mine.\nSouth Pointe Park Hidden between ritzy sky-scraping condos and the inlet linking the ocean to Miami’s port, 22-acre South Pointe Park is where locals stroll, picnic, toast passing cruise ships, even practice karate moves. Pristine trails wind around dunes, native grasses and palm trees; a coral-flecked walkway runs along the inlet to an elegant new pier.\nAfter dark, artful towers beam pastel hues that don’t confuse sea turtle hatchlings during their moonlight crawls from sand nests to ocean. Folks in business suits and tracksuits walk dogs by a quirky lighthouse sculpture to a field to romp and fetch coconuts. Lucky dogs.\nSouth of Fifth The park anchors the casual-tony “South of Fifth” Street neighborhood just below the island’s traffic-clogged club scene. SoFi attractions include the Jewish Museum of Florida, which profiles natives from Miss Florida winners to philanthropic gangsters, and distinctive lodging.\nOne oceanfront gem is even child- and pet-friendly. The art-deco-era Stanton has retained its character through major expansions. Its recently renovated rooms offer peace and value rarely found in more touristy blocks. The beaches? Free access, pretty and spacious.\nAt the Third Street lifeguard stand, people gather for free yoga classes at sunrise and sunset. Cool- downs are done in the ocean.\nSunken treasure beckons 150 yards southeast of Second Street’s lifeguard stand: the Jose Cuervo Reef. “Sinko de Mayo” 2000 celebrants submerged a concrete margarita bar, with bar stools, creating an artificial reef frequented by tropical fish. Swim there right from the beach or rent a paddle board from F1rst Surf Shop a short walk away.\nCool bars The reef bar’s not the only joint free from cover charges, dress codes and attitude. The Stanton’s beachfront bistro lures condo-neighbors with zesty mojitos flavored by locally distilled Miami Club rum. At Radio Bar, which hugs a sky-high transmitter, fruity and fiery cocktails energize regulars stacking blocks, shooting pool and pitching popcorn.\nOther local favorites: Purdy Lounge for funk, hip-hop, reggae and dancing. Foxhole, a warehouse with firearms as decor. And the Broken Shaker, which is tucked in the poolside courtyard of the 1930s art deco Indian Creek Hotel (now Freehand Hostel).\nIt offers board games, bocce, pingpong and drinks and bites crafted from fresh ingredients (shiitake bitters and flatbreads).\nPrefer a cosmopolitan vibe? At the Local House, you can sip ethereal potions with Miami entrepreneurs.\nGood eats Breakfast regulars arrive early to snag tables at century-old Joe’s Stone Crab and patio seats at Lee & Marie’s Cakery, an all-about-local bakery-cafe. For bargain gourmet fare, dine alfresco at the Cafe at Books & Books.\nFor huge plates of comfort food nearly round-the-clock, hit whimsically retro Big Pink for its TV Dinner specials served on metal trays. Or cool off with a salad, juice or smoothie at Pura Vida. Cotter’s usual: the Best (fresh-squeezed spinach, ginger, pineapple, strawberries). Mine: a supersize acai-laced Loco Coco.\nThe promenade Outclassing boardwalks, a lovely landscaped promenade curves along the beachfront. It’s buffered from Ocean Drive’s crowds and heat by flowering sea grape and palms. Locals walk, skate and pedal, often on bikeshare rides, cooled by ocean breezes.\nThe promenade turns west along the inlet, eventually reaching the west-facing marina and Monty’s Sunset tiki bar, popular for local bands, hot DJs and hypnotic bay views.\nCotter just called in another a tip for finding bliss: CryoTherapyMiami’s ice-bath, her $79 “fountain of youth.” I’ll save that one for a rainy day.\nRobin Soslow is a freelance writer based in Florida.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T02:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T11:50:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
