Japanese reported 58 percent satisfaction, and Chinese 54 percent - with security an issue. \n'Cultivating hospitality shows the world that each visitor is welcomed. It also encourages jobs and growth,' the statement said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T06:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T22:12:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
