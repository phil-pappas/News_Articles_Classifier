Savy Insurance Companies who had accepted to join the association's social gathering for what is considered to be their most important meeting of the year. Particular mention went to Alain St.Ange, the Minister who is responsible for Tourism, for his continued support of the car hire businesses and for working alongside them to help grow the tourism industry of Seychelles. \nMr. Vincent Padayachy thanked his association members for a good and fruitful AGM 2015 and said that he would work with the authorities to try to solve challenges that today faced the Seychelles Car Hire Operators Association. He also thanked everyone who have been trying to not only understand, but to also appreciate the challenges that the association was facing. \nWhen he was asked to address the lunch event, Minister Alain St.Ange said that he was taking the floor on behalf of his colleague, Minister Benstrong, as well as on behalf of the government. \"Today, as we are together, we need to reflect all together on our country's tourism industry. We do not have a tourism industry that benefits the car hire operators and another one that benefits the hotel industry. We do not have a tourism industry for the government and another one for the private sector. We have but one tourism industry, and it is the Seychelles tourism industry that belongs to our country and that is for all of us - you and us included,\" Minister St.Ange said. \nThe Minister went on to appeal to the car hire operators and everyone else working with the tourism industry to know what their operating licenses authorizes them to do. Minister St.Ange said that one's right and responsibility must end when the rights and responsibility of the other player starts. \"Let us respect each other. Let us not step on the foot of the next operator, and let us remain united, because that will make us strong as an industry,\" the Minister said. \nMinister Alain St.Ange then spoke about the importance of tourism for Seychelles. \"Today, we look at the car hire operators and say that you are part and parcel of the tourism industry. Our industry that remains vital for the economy of Seychelles is nevertheless very volatile and is affected by internal as well as from external forces. When our key source markets for example sneezes, our tourism industry and then the economy of Seychelles catches the flu that arrives with its fever,\" the Minister said as he ended his address to the large number of Car Hire Operators Association members. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
