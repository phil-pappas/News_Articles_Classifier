Get Some Retail Therapy \nToronto has a range of shopping experiences for the thrifty to the indulgent. If the weather is not agreeable to a walk down Queen Street - my favourite shopping outing - indoor malls abound. \nThe Eaton Centre - though it no longer houses the iconic Canadian department store that is its namesake - is the city's top draw and offers more than 250 stores. The bright and airy domed shopping mecca is also part of the PATH, so you can access miles and miles of more retail space underground. \nOther shopping centres in Toronto include Yorkdale - featuring many high-end retailers - on the Spadina subway line and the Pacific Mall, which is North America's largest Chinese Asian mall. \nAlso in the neighbourhood: The AGO is right in the middle of the city's bustling Chinatown .

Ponder the Past at the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) \nRight next to the \"Museum\" subway stop, the ROM is a great indoor pursuit on a rainy day. \nHighlights - aside from the striking architecture of the building itself - include one of Canada's largest permanent collections of dinosaurs bones, Chinese temple art and a bat-cave simulation. \nAlso in the neighbourhood: The Gardiner Museum of glass and ceramics, the Bata Shoe Museum and Yorkville shopping district.

An underwater tunnel has you walking right through Dangerous Lagoon, full of sharks, barracudas and more. \nThe aquarium is not home to dolphins, seals or other mammals.

The CN Tower \nA rainy day may not be the best time to take in the panoramic views of Toronto you get from this 1,815 ft ft high tower, but the city’s number one attraction will probably be less crowded. In addition, if the weather forecast calls for the rain to end, try making a reservation for the restaurant. Enjoy a sky-high meal and then visit the observation deck afterwards. Admission to CN Tower is included in your restaurant reservation and you will skip any entrance line-up. More » Body Blitz has two locations in Toronto. Photo © Body Blitz 10.
