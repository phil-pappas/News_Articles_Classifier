Çamlıhemşin District Governor Aziz Gölbaşı said, \"In order to offer different activities to tourists who come to Ayder Highland, we have arranged horse-riding tours to one of the highest waterfalls in Turkey, Bulut Waterfall.\" Gölbaşı explained that Rize is home to the 4,000-meter-high Kaçkar and Altıparmak Mountains and is an important nature tourism center. He added that Ayder highland was one of the most attractive tourist zones and had the capacity to host 600,000 tourists. Gölbaşı stressed that this capacity was increasing as well. \"I invite everyone to enjoy this natural beauty,\" Gölbaşı said. Highlighting that they were planning to redo the road heading to the waterfall as a pedestrian walkway, Gölbaşı said: \"The district government has worked with the Kaçkar Tourism Association. Thanks to this cooperation, we built a walking path for tourists who came to Ayder Highland. We wanted to preserve the natural fabric of the area, so we shied away from using concrete. We only allow horse-riding tours to reflect local traditions. This project has caught the attention of many Arab tourists in particular.\" Çamlıhemşin Mayor Osman Haşimoğlu said: \"This waterfall can only be visited by horse-riding tours and hiking. I recommend that everyone should come see this waterfall in its undisturbed, natural environment.\" An owner of a local business, Mustafa Memoğlu, said Gölbaşı and Haşimoğlu rearranged the area to bring variety to the tourist activities available in the region. Memoğlu added: \"Tourists can enjoy the waterfall after a 2-kilometer-long horse-riding tour. In particular, when the track was first opened, Arab tourists were very interested. This way, we have added to our tourist options, which are usually thermal or cultural tourism and horse-riding tourism. Onur Aydoğdu, a visitor from İzmir, said: \"It is amazing to see this natural beauty on the back of a horse. Everyone should experience this. Bulut Waterfall is one of the most beautiful waterfalls in the Black Sea region. The unpolluted air and high oxygen levels make you dizzy. This place is literally like heaven. To do this trip by horse is an interesting adventure. It is impossible to describe the joy you get when first arriving at the waterfall. That's why everyone should come and see this place.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T00:25:25.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
