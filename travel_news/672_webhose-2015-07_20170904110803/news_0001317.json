Depp brings Captain Jack Sparrow to life (and back to life) in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, and latter-day buccaneers, wenches and scaliwags can explore some of the real-life Caribbean destinations where the Disney films were shot -- including the latest (final?) film, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides . \nPuerto Rico \nMuch of the fourth POTC film, released in summer 2011, was not even filmed in the Caribbean, but rather in locations throughout Hawaii . However, the movie's final beach scene was filmed near the east coast city of Fajardo , Puerto Rico -- on and near the small offshore islands of Palomino and Palominitos, to be precise. Palomino Island should be familiar to guests of the iconic El Conquistador hotel, which stages beach and water activities there. Other scenes were shot in Old San Juan , at the San Cristobal Fort . \nDominica \nMajor sequences of the original Pirates of the Caribbean film were shot in the jungle island of Dominica , and the film helped put this lush tropical island on the tourist map the way that The Lord of the Rings films spotlighted the natural wonders of New Zealand . \nDominica's northeast coast, with its dramatic cliffs and lush foliage, provides the backdrop for some of the key moments in the second film, Dead Man's Chest , including boat scenes filmed on the Indian River, a cannibal village where Jack nearly becomes the main course, and a fight sequence involving a huge water wheel. Sets were built in Soufriere and Vielle Case, and scenes were shot in locations like Pegua Bay, Titou Gorge, High Meadow, Pointe Guinade, and Hampstead Beach. \nBreakaway Adventures has designed a nine-day Dominica walking tour that takes in many of the same vistas seen in the films, including the Indian River (the stand-in for the movie's \"Pantano River\"), \"Cannibal Island\" in the Valley of Desolation, and the films'\"Shipwreck Cove\" near Capucin Cape. \n\"With all the hype surrounding the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' sequel, we thought it would be fun to offer a tour that allows travelers to see the sites they'll view this summer on the big screen,\" says Carol Keskitalo, co-owner of Breakaway Adventures. \"Guests will see why this amazing island was the perfect natural stage for sword fights, secret missions and swashbuckling adventures.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T20:08:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
