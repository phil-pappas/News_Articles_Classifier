The portion for retail investors, who also gets a 5 per cent price discount, was over-subscribed 4.49 times.\nInstitutional investors bid for 9.49 crore shares, representing 1.80 times of the 5.28 crore shares on offer.\nThe floor price of Rs 254 a share was at a discount of 2.14 per cent over Friday’s closing price of Rs 259.55.\nShares of PFC closed at Rs 254.05, down 2.12 per cent over previous close, tracking the broader benchmark Sensex which fell nearly 2 per cent on fears of Government curbs on investments through P-Notes.\nPFC is the second PSU to be divested in the current fiscal under the government’s disinvestment programme. In April, the government had sold 5 per cent stake in REC for Rs 1,550 crore.\nAt present, government holds 72.80 per cent equity in Power Finance Corporation. After sale of 6.60 crore shares representing 5 per cent stake on offer, government’s holding will be reduced to 67.80 per cent.\nPFC is the first disinvestment under the modified OFS rules of Sebi under which companies are allowed to disclose stake sale plans two ‘banking’ days ahead of the issue.\nThe Department of Disinvestment had approached Sebi in March saying they do not want trading days in-between the announcement and stake sale.\nEarlier, the companies were required to give an advance notice of two trading days before the OFS, which the government says gave scope for speculators to beat down the share price of the disinvestment-bound PSU.\nThe department has a Rs 69,500-crore target from PSU disinvestment in the current fiscal, of which Rs 41,000 crore would come from minority stake sale and Rs 28,500 crore from strategic stake sale.\n 12:30 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T18:36:08.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
