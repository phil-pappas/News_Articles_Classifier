'When taking photos, I love capturing the amazing colours that are created when the sunlight is reflected and refracted off the water.\n'Each wave and each day is truly unique and has something special to offer.\nRemarkably, Marck's photographic is yet to be his profession - his day job is as an online derivatives trader - but that is something the 28-year-old wants to change. And with scenes such as this, who can blame him.\nBotha, who has been surfing these breaks off the coast of Natal for more than 20 years, using his experience to get in the best positions\nThe 28-year-old captures the colours and formations of the waves as they rise and fall from above and below the surface\nHe says the perspective he gets from the water is something most people 'don't have the pleasure of experiencing from the beach sand'\n'It's an amazing experience to be in the ocean, surrounded by its beauty, immersed in nature, and experiencing the raw power of the ocean as its waves beat relentlessly,' he says.\nMarck's shots capture waves rising high with buildings dotted along the shoreline, while others capture unique perspectives of the surging forces of nature from underneath the water.\n'I have incredible fun in the ocean capturing waves. When conditions are good, I find myself bubbling with energy and excitement, especially when I line up with a really great wave,' he says.\nFor Botha, despite using his home breaks as his muse, 'each wave and each day is truly unique and has something special to offer'\nThe combination of the surf's beauty, being immersed in nature and the raw power of the ocean keep bringing Botha back\nHe says, as an artist, the most appealing element is 'the amazing colours created when the sunlight is reflected and refracted off the water'\n'Excitement is often later mixed with some nerves - nerves that I may have had the angle of my shot off, or that water droplets clung to my lens.\n'After racing home to check my footage, I'm normally pleasantly relieved and super stoked with what I have managed to capture.'\nMarck's experience in the water, ever since he represented Natal at the South African Body boarding Championships as a 12-year-old, is a great advantage in helping him catch the perfect moments in often dangerous conditions for all of us to enjoy.\nWhen most surfers line up a wave it's with the intention to ride it, but Botha finds himself 'bubbling with energy' about his next shot\nBotha says he gets nervous about whether he did justice to the incredible scenes, but is usually 'pleasantly relieved and super stoked'\nWhile many of Botha's images capture a truly recognisable scene, he often creates an other-worldy pattern like beautiful blown glass\nBotha's prints are available for sale as the online derivatives trader bids to turn his photographic passion into his profession\nRead more: Marck Botha | Art Prints | Art and Photography", "external_links": ["http://www.digitalgallery.co.za/marckbotha/", "http://dailym.ai/1SQI2bY"], "published": "2015-07-31T19:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T15:56:07.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
