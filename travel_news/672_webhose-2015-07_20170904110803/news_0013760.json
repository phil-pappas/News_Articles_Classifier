The South African government expects the industry to generate nearly $600 million a year by the end of the decade and create 225,000 new jobs. \nThe industry employs over 700,000 people in South Africa, according to industry watchers. \nGhana's Deputy Tourism Minister, Dzifa Gomashie, who was a key note speaker at the event, lauded the Brand South Africa – the umbrella organization that promotes South African tourism – for its success at creating a compelling image for the country. \nShe said her ministry is working with Brand South Africa to promote tourism in Ghana and Africa as a whole. \nDzifa Gomashie said her ministry’s relationship with South Africa tourism will persist “as long as we have interest in one another and realize that there is a brand called Africa and Africans owe it themselves to tell the our story; for as long as we all have that passion, that realization that there is a need for emancipation of mind, of self and seeing that a story about South Africa ultimately affects Ghana, because the world doesn’t look at South Africa and Ghana and Kenya…the world looks at Africa as a country”. \nThe workshop was well attended by representatives of the Ghana Tourism Federation (GHATOF), the Ghana Tourism Authority (GHATA) and travel and tour agencies from both Ghana and South Africa, among others.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T12:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T12:40:15.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
