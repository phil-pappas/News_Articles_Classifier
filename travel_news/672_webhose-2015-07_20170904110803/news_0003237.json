The donors included French Sulpician priests who seemed to have no qualms about contributing financially to pay tribute to a British war hero. \n“We tend to think of Montreal as a sort of gated community: the French, the English, the other ones,” Bumbaru said. “The fact that you have a monument to a British admiral paid by French Catholic priests tells a lot about the…complexity of Montreal society.” \nOld Montreal contains a trove of historical monuments within a few blocks of each other — some newer than others. \nThe Maisonneuve monument in Place d’Armes Square is a tribute to the city’s founder, Paul de Chomedey, sieur de Maisonneuve, and was built in 1895 by Louis-Philippe Hebert, one of the province’s best-known sculptors. \nA more recent statue in Old Montreal depicts Marguerite Bourgeoys , who founded several girls’ schools in the 1600s and was canonized in 1982. Artist Jules Lasalle shies away from traditional religious depictions in his 1988 sculpture and shows the pioneering educator leading two children through a fountain. \nDorchester Square, at the corner of Peel Street and Rene-Levesque Boulevard, contains an array of monuments, including those of Sir Wilfrid Laurier (who faces off with Sir John A. Macdonald’s across the street), a Boer War memorial and a statue of Scottish poet Robert Burns . \nAccording to Bumbaru, this collection of monuments is a fitting allegory for Montreal’s complex and sometimes divided history. \n“The problem with Montreal’s identity and reality is that it’s better told by a number of voices than just by one,” he said. \nIn recent decades, the city has renewed efforts to create public art. Unlike the early monuments, these are quirkier and spread around different boroughs around the island. \nAMONG HUNDREDS OF PIECES, A FEW ARE MUST-SEES \n— Alexander Calder’s iconic “ L’Homme ,” an abstract steel sculpture designed for Expo 67, located in Parc Jean Drapeau. \n— Raymond Mason’s much-photographed “ Illuminated Crowd “: a polyester-resin statue featuring a crowd of 65 people showing what the inscription calls “the flow of man’s emotion through space.” That is on downtown McGill College Avenue. \n— The imposing one-ton figure of legendary Quebec strongman Louis Cyr in the city’s Saint-Henri neighbourhood where he once lived. (Parc des Hommes-Forts, St-Antoine Street, near de Courcelle) \n— And John Seward Johnson Jr.’s sculpture “Catching Up” depicts a man reading a life-size, readable bronze copy of the Montreal Gazette from July 4, 1985. ( 4141 Sherbrooke W ). \nEven more art can be found within institutions such as universities and government buildings and even in the city’s subway, due partly to a government program that requires developers to allocate a fraction of their budget to art. \nIn a city known for festivals, Bumbaru says there’s an increasing desire among Montrealers to have a cultural contribution that’s more permanent. \n“It ensures we’re a cultural city that can have different times and different seasons,” he said. \nIF YOU GO \nThe City of Montreal’s public art department maintains a list of more than 300 works of city-owned public art at artpublic.ville.montreal.qc.ca/en/ E-mail this Article", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T18:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T21:20:13.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
