A number of other companies were forced to wait until the outcome to learn if they would be able to recoup the millions they have also paid out.Now TTG has learned that almost 18 months later, these companies are still waiting for a resolution.HMRC refused to disclose the full amount of VAT it is still disputing with the companies, as well as the names of the businesses, citing a series of legal exemptions. However, it is believed a total of £100 million could be at stake.Companies still wrangling with the taxman are believed to include Hotels4u and Alpharooms.The most recent accounts for lowcosttravelgroup Ltd also reveal a figure of £1.1 million in disputed VAT, which is being withheld by HMRC.“HMRC is treating the Medhotels case as a one-off and are therefore continuing to not repay the various other cases that were standing behind Medhotels,” said Chris Photi, senior partner at White Hart Associates. “They are trying to assert it is a differentiated case, however, they are still trotting out all the old arguments.”Thomas Cook-owned Hotels4u was due to have its case heard at the end of last year, but the hearing was cancelled.“It’s my view that they [the other companies] are not substantially different to Medhotels but its HMRC’s view that they are,” said Rob Smith, VAT manager at BDO.The taxman has already come under fire from senior figures in the travel industry for leaving travel firms in the lurch. Steve Endacott, founder of On Holiday Group, blamed the collapse of his online travel agency in 2014 on HMRC. At the time of its administration, the firm was still trying to get its hands on £4.5 million VAT it claimed it was owed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T12:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T14:56:36.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
