Neil Perry and his merry band of sommeliers and ‘mixologists’ for Qantas Source: Supplied \nMORE surprising than the fact Qantas has taken sommeliers and mixologist on board is the fact that our national carrier is the third biggest purchaser of Australian wine. Yes, THIRD. \nThe airline has announced a new team of wine experts and ‘mixologists’ from the Rockpool Group, who’ll be responsible for choosing the wine, champagne, spirits and other liquid refreshments for the airline’s domestic and international flights and lounges. I’ll have the Pinot Gris, oh, hang on, hand me a Chardy instead ...

Cap’n Perry & Co at Rockpool Source: Supplied \n“Qantas’ new holistic approach to food and beverage will mean not only matching our menus with the perfect wine, but with the perfect cocktail or champagne,” said Mr Evans. \n“We invest over $15 million dollars in the Australian wine industry every year, so we take the \nselection process very seriously. We are really proud to showcase Australian wine to the world, and we’ll keep supporting boutique Australian wineries as well as the iconic drops that have defined Australia’s global winemaking reputation. \n“Qantas is the third largest purchaser of wine in Australia and we also invest significantly in training our own teams to ensure they are equipped with the knowledge to recommend wines to our customers,’’ added Mr Evans. \nAmong the group is Head of Sommeliers Australia, David Lawler and one of only two Master Sommeliers in Australia, Sebastian Crowther, as well as head bartenders of Rockpool restaurants around the country.

They also provide recommendations while the Rockpool mixologists will create monthly cocktails. \nMore than 150 cabin crew are currently trained as on-board sommeliers and more will be joining this group this year while over 2000 Qantas Cabin Crew have completed an introductory, intermediate or advanced level of wine training. \nCheers!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T13:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T20:49:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
