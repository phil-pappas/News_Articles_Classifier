As celebrity superstars prepared to tee off on the 18 th hole, Korbel challenged them to show off their best champagne celebration skills as part of the Celebrity Spray-Off. Rypien took home top honors after he popped the cork on a bottle of Korbel and it traveled the furthest distance - 87ft. Close behind finishing in second place was retired American Speed Skater World Champion Dan Jansen who shook the bottle of Korbel in style before launching the cork 85ft. In third place was 10-time LPGA Champion Annika Sorenstam with a 79ft blast followed by fourth place finisher former NFL Pro Bowl Quarterback Trent Green . A total of 34 celebrities joined forces with Korbel to participate in the Spray-Off which is judged on cork distance (although style and champagne spray added to the excitement for the fans). Although he was not crowned the champion, Nine-Time Grammy Award Winner Justin Timberlake showed off his champagne spraying skills when he soaked the crowd after popping a long distance cork. Comedian Larry the Cable Guy, Season Nineteen Dancing with the Stars Champion Alfonso Ribeiro and Duck Dynasty star Willie Robertson won over the crowd with their explosive champagne sprays and animated cork popping. In addition, NFL fan favorites Brian Urlacher , Aaron Rodgers and Emmitt Smith drove their corks down field traveling distances over 70 ft. \" Korbel has been toasting the American Century Championship for years and we're excited to be back for this great event with our great partners,\" said Gary Heck , owner and president of Korbel Champagne Cellars. \"The Celebrity Spray-Off is a chance for the players to have fun for a great cause through the Korbel Toast Life Foundation.\" Football Players and Coaches: Cris Collinsworth , Trent Dilfer , Herm Edwards , John Elway , Trent Green , AJ Hawk, Aaron Rodgers , Mark Rypien , Alex Smith , Emmitt Smith , Joe Theismann , Brian Urlacher Basketball Players: Ray Allen , Shane Battier , Vinny Del Negro , TV Personalities : Larry the Cable Guy, Alfonso Ribeiro , Willie Robertson , Justin Timberlake , Baseball Players: Josh Beckett , Joe Carter , Roger Clemens , David Cone , Tom Glavine , Greg Maddux , Bret Saberhagen , Tim Wakefield , David Wells Other participants : Mardy Fish , Bode Miller , Annika Sorenstam , Dan Jansen , Chad Pfeifer , Brian Baumgartner Complete list of participants: Shane Battier : NBA Forward - Miami Heat Josh Beckett : Former MLB All-Star Pitcher Joe Carter : Former MLB All-Star OF Roger Clemens : Former MLB All-Star P Cris Collinsworth : Sports TV Analyst, Former NFL Wide Receiver David Cone : Former Major League Baseball Pitcher Vinny Del Negro : Former NBA Player and Coach Trent Dilfer : Former NFL Pro Bowl QB Herm Edwards : Former NFL Head Coach John Elway : NFL Hall of Fame QB Mardy Fish : Professional Tennis Player Tom Glavine : Former MLB Pitcher Trent Green : NFL Color Analyst/ NFL Super Bowl Champion AJ Hawk: NFL Pro Bowl LB - Green Bay Packers Dan Jansen : Former American Speed Skater World Champion Greg Maddux : MLB Hall of Famer Bode Miller : US Ski Team - Olympic Gold Medalist Alfonso Ribeiro : Actor - Season Nineteen Dancing with the Stars Champion Willie Robertson : Duck Dynasty Star Aaron Rodgers : NFL Pro Bowl QB - Green Bay Packers Mark Rypien : Former NFL Pro Bowl QB Bret Saberhagen : Former MLB P/World Series MVP Alex Smith : NFL Pro Bowl QB - Kansas City Chiefs Emmitt Smith : NFL Hall of Fame RB Annika Sorenstam : Retired Golfer: 10 LPGA Major Championships Joe Theismann : Former NFL MVP Justin Timberlake : American singer, songwriter and actor Brian Urlacher : Former NFL All-Pro & Pro Bowl LB Tim Wakefield : Former MLB Pitcher David Wells : Former MLB All-Star Pitcher Larry the Cable Guy: Comedian: Blue Collar Comedy Tour Chad Pfeifer : Bush Center Wounded Warrior Champion Vinny Del Negro : Former NMA Coach and Analysis with NBA TV Brian Baumgartner : American Film and Television Actor 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T19:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T19:52:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
