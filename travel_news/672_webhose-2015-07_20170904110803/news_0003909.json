Comment Posted Jul. 21, 2015 at 11:30 AM By The Associated Press Posted Jul. 21, 2015 at 11:30 AM Over 1,000 subcontracted airport security officers, baggage handlers and wheelchair attendants at New York City's two major airports plan to strike starting Wednesday night. Service Employees International Union Local 32BJ says picketing would begin at 10 p.m. Wednesday at John F. Kennedy Airport and 6 a.m. Thursday at LaGuardia. The union says workers' demands for better treatment \"have been met with illegal repression.\" It says their employer has threatened to fire workers for striking and otherwise violated their organizing rights. They work for Delta subcontractor Aviation Safeguards. Its parent company, Herndon, Virginia-based Command Services Corp., hasn't immediately returned a call about the strike vote. It's not immediately clear how the planned strike would affect travelers. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has no immediate comment.
