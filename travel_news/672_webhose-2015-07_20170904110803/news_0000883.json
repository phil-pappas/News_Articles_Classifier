Source: Supplied \nFOREIGN Minister Julie Bishop has described never-before-seen footage from the MH17 crash site as “sickening”. \nVideo obtained by News Corp shows Russian-backed rebels ransacking the luggage of passenger and crew after shooting down the Malaysian Airlines flight, and has been released one year after the crash. The footage shocked the Foreign Minister who has been in close contact with the families of Australian victims who were on board. \n“I saw that footage this morning, it is sickening to watch,” she said in an interview with Nine’s Today. \n“And twelve months on from the downing of MH17 it’s deeply concerning that this footage has emerged now.” The video shows militia going through an Australian passenger's personal belongings. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \nMs Bishop said the chilling video, which shows the moment Russian-backed rebels realise they   plane, was consistent with intelligence received at the time that a commercial flight had been shot down by missile in eastern Ukraine. \nPrime Minister Tony Abbott has also commented on the vision, saying it showed the “enormity” of the tragedy. \n“It highlights the fact that this was an atrocity, it was in no way an accident,” he told ABC. \n“They may not have known that they were shooting down a civilian passengers plane, but \nthey were deliberately shooting out of the sky what they knew was a large aircraft.” \nThe footage is expected to contribute to the investigation into MH17, which is likely to lead to an international tribunal . \nMs Bishop said it was crucial those responsible were held to account. \nAsked whether she was frustrated at the last of action 12 months after the plane was downed she acknowledged that “these things take time”. \n“The investigation has been exceedingly thorough,” Ms Bishop said. The footage was taken within two hours of the plane being shot down. Source: Supplied \nThe wreckage of the plane had been transported back to the Netherlands for investigators to reconstruct and they had already determined that it was brought down by “high energy objects”. \nThe next report, due out in October was expected to establish who was responsible and Ms Bishop said it needed to be thorough so that an independent criminal tribunal, which Australia has called for, could commence its investigations without delay. \nAmong the 298 passengers and crew who all perished aboard the Kuala Lumpur bound flight were 38 Australians. \nMs Bishop said 200 family members were expected to gather in Canberra today to mark the one year anniversary of the downing of MH17. \n“(It’s) going to be a very emotional day,” she said. \n“Their grief is inconsolable and the burden of grieving and then seeing this footage will be almost too much to bear,” she said. \nHowever, she said the government was determined to see those responsible for bringing the plane down would be brought to justice. \n“We will not leave any stone unturned in our quest for justice for the families of MH17”.
