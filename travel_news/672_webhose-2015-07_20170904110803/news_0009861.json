We need clear, strong solutions,” State Minister Nikos Pappas told the weekly Ependysi in an interview published on Saturday.\nApart from the terms of a new loan, Greece and its lenders are also expected to discuss the sustainability of its debt, which is around 170 percent of GDP. Greece has repeatedly asked for a debt relief and the IMF has said this is needed for the Greek accord to be viable.\nEuropean Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told Italy’s La Stampa daily in an interview that a recent analysis on the issue “justified some concerns”. He added a Greek exit from the euro was “certainly out of the question now”.\nTsipras, who is by far the most popular politician in Greece according to opinion polls, has said his priority is to secure the bailout package before dealing with the political fallout from the Syriza party rebellion.\nAccording to a poll by Metron Analysis for Parapolitika newspaper on Saturday, 61 percent of Greeks had a positive view of Tsipras against 36 percent who disapproved. An overwhelming majority – 78 percent – still wanted Greece to stay in the euro zone against 19 percent in favour of going back to the drachma.\nTsipras insists there is no viable alternative to the bailout but has been wary of striking out against his party opponents in a bid to keep it together, at least while talks proceed.\nFlabouraris called on Syriza rebels to drop their opposition.\n“They are still my comrades and I urge them to get back to their senses even at the last moment,” he told Skai television. “They should realise that the Left movement is now in power. It’s not an opposition party. Now we have to discuss the new landscape.”\n 26, 2015 9:19 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T17:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T14:10:45.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
