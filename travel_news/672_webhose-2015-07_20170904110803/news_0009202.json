The bus driver, Edip G., was detained by the police immediately after the incident and the woman's body was taken to a local morgue. \nThe unfortunate incident came amid recent isolated attacks by Turkish nationalists on tourists who appear to be Asian after reports of China banning religious activities during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and abusing the minority Muslim Uighurs in China's Xinjiang region. The reports sparked some demonstrations in Turkey and resulted in attacks on Asians.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T01:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T09:38:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
