The Dh100m project was completed last year, according to the Department of Municipality and Planning. \nIn May, Ajman’s tourism department said it was aiming to attract 5 million tourists a year by 2021. \nThe total number of guests who checked into the emirate’s hotels and hotel apartments last year was 850,000. \nThe new R Hotels property would join Ajman’s two mid-market properties, both by R Hotels, and four luxury properties. \nThere are nine one and two-star hotels in the emirate. \nOberoi, an Indian hotel operator, and the Mauritius-based Lux Resorts & Hotels group are expected to open hotels in Al Zorah in the next two years. \nThe area is run by the master developer Solidere International. \n“[Ajman Tourism Development Department] has been actively tapping different markets like China, and our hotels are also beefing up our nationality mix with arrivals from Turkey, Germany, Oman and Eastern Europe,” said Sumair Tariq, the managing director of R Hotels. \n“We are expecting higher room demands in the next couple of years, as confirmed by the opening and announcements of new hotels in Ajman.” \nTourists from the Middle East, excluding those from the UAE and the Arabian Gulf, form Ajman’s largest source market, followed by Russia and the CIS states last year, according to the department. \nAlthough traffic congestion is among the top challenges for Ajman’s tourism sector, the emirate has signed a deal with Whitelake Consortium to develop an airport in its Al Manama enclave, 52 kilometres east of Ajman city. \nThe Dh2.1 billion Ajman International Airport is expected to be completed in 2018, and it will be capable of handling more than 2 million passengers a year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T02:48:00.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
