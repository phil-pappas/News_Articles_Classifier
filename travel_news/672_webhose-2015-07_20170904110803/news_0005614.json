Against global competition, the Centre’s TenOnCall (TOC) offering beat 13 finalists to win her first International Association of Convention Centres (AIPC) Innovation Award 2015.\nReceiving the award at the AIPC Award Dinner held in conjunction with the organisation’s 2015 Annual Conference and 57th General Assembly in Boston, USA, recently, Deputy General Manager, Simon Lomas conveyed that “winning this prestigious AIPC Award for a ‘home-grown’ innovation as we celebrate our 10th year (of operation) makes the victory Lomas shares that TenOnCall was conceptualised in November 2008 to address low-occupancy and under-utilised meeting rooms on what was then the Centre’s level 4.\n“TOC comprises 10 flexible meeting spaces offering a differentiated meeting experience for short-lead bookings or just-in-time meetings, where clients can walk in, select their pre-set room configuration and execute a same-day meeting for 15 to 150 persons.”\nOnce off the ground, TOC’s unique full- and half-day meeting packages with no hidden costs became a point of difference between the Centre and her competition. “The all-inclusive packages comprise complimentary WiFi access, use of audio-visual equipment and an AV technician on standby, built-in LCD signage at the entrance foyer plus its signature, innovative all-day dining concept that includes free-flow lifestyle cuisine and beverages, enjoyed in an open central atrium, throughout the meeting duration,” explains “Besides delivering an innovative, flexible and value-added solution to clients that had not existed prior to its launch, TOC has provided an additional revenue stream. The popularity of TOC has also grown significantly, registering a 357% and 343% increase in events held and attendance numbers respectively, since its first full-year of operation (2009) and last year (2014).”\nBearing testimony to TOC’s success is the fact that several venues have made an educational and knowledge exchange visit to the Centre with a view to implementing the TOC innovation while on the home front, many venues (primarily hotels) have made efforts to imitate the offering which has spurred interest and demand for just-in-time meetings in Kuala Lumpur.\nThe Centre has since expanded on the TOC offering with additional innovations such as TenOnCall PLUS which extends the TOC benefits to three more function areas of varying sizes with the ‘PLUS’ being a unique space with natural lighting, own personal free-flow lifestyle cuisine and beverage service, and a dedicated private meeting room and an outdoor balcony as a designated smoking area; as meeting designs become more prominent, TOC Beanie Experience with cosy and comfortable bean bags, versus standard banquet chairs, provides an innovative and relaxing out-of-the-norm meeting experience that comes with takeaway latte, cappuccino, coffee or tea, and complimentary Bean-ovation value-adds such as titbits, energy booster drinks and energy bars, comfy slippers and a stress ball; and TOC ‘Sundown Hour Packages’ so clients can bring their meeting programme to a relaxing conclusion with a two-hour cocktail hour of free-flow beverages. This provides a perfect social hub to maximise interaction.\nAIPC represents a global network of 170 leading convention centres in 54 countries and boasts the active involvement of more than 950 management-level professionals worldwide. The Innovation Award reflects AIPC’s mission of Encouraging and Recognising Excellence in Convention Centre Management and is designed to recognise innovations and creative thinking in all areas of convention centre management, marketing and operations.\nSource:- KLCC\nRelated Posts Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre announces a record 2014 as it celebrates its 10th anniversary Seoul to Host UIA Associations Round Table Asia Meeting in October MIA Director, National Counterparts Travel To Washington, D.c.
