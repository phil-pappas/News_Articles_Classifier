Boasting of a vibrant lifestyle and spectacular attractions, the city eludes typical Far East travel parameters and stands tall as a unique and fascinating destination. Most people invariably book one of the Hong Kong Macau packages for their first experience of the city. However, what astounds most tourists is that the city has just so much more to offer, even when you've covered all the usual sights and experiences. Whether you've already been on a Hong Kong vacation, or are visiting for the first time on one of the Hong Kong packages, here are some brilliant off-beat attractions and activities that you simply must visit and try:Kandoorie Farm:This beautiful place stands in stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong. It is a botanical garden and an animal reserve that often serves as a fun picnic spot for families. Spend some time here to simply revel in the beauty of nature or gather your thoughts and enjoy a few minutes of peace and solitude.Chungking Mansions:Hong Kong has no shortage of global travel attractions and culinary adventures. But most travellers are looking for authenticity rather than glamour. Underneath the world food platter and sparkling places to see, exists the real Hong Kong. This mansion is one of the places where you can witness authentic Honk Kong. All the ethnicities of the world can be found in the hustle and bustle here. From African traders to Chinese merchants and backpackers to holiday goers mingle and socialise together in the local restaurants here. Join the crowd and enjoy one of the most amazing experiences you'll ever have on your Hong Kong Macau packages.Lantau Island:This island is a great addition to any of the Hong Kong packages. A getaway to this island makes for a wonderful day trip. Other similar options for island getaways around the city include Lamma Island and Cheung Chau Island, but Lantau Island is by far the best amongst them. Here you can enjoy some great water sports and adventures or simply pamper yourself with relaxing massages.
