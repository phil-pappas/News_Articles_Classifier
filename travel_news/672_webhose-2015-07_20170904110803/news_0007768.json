That afternoon, another truck will deliver a 90-ton section of the device, which will be the key component in a $120 million project to combat cancer. Traffic might slow as the trucks approach the Liberty Township campus, which is at the intersection of Interstate 75 and Ohio State Route 129. The trucks, whose trailers take up two lanes, are traveling from the East Coast at 40 mph. The first is set to arrive around 9 a.m. Wednesday depending on weather and highway construction. The second is expected around 4 p.m. Each will take I-75 south to State Route 129 and get off at Cincinnati-Dayton Road. They will make a right onto Liberty Way, where the medical center is located. The trucks will circle around to the back of the hospital. “There is a police escort, but they don’t have to shut down the highway,” hospital spokesman Terry Loftus said. “As they pull off the highway onto Cincinnati-Dayton Road, it gets a bit more tricky. It could create delays, but the Ohio Department of Transportation and local police are involved with us all the way through Ohio to provide escorts for this big load coming to the Liberty campus.” The smaller piece of machinery will be mounted atop the bigger one to form what’s called a cyclotron. Manufactured in Germany by Varian Inc., the machinery arrived in Baltimore by ship earlier this month. The trailers carrying the equipment are 210 feet long. They have 15 axles and 62 tires. The crane that will lower the cyclotron into place weighs 800 tons. Maxim Crane Works of Wilder said it took more than 40 semis to deliver the parts for the crane to the construction site. The Varian ProBeam proton therapy system will focus radiation treatment on the tumors of children and adults with cancer. Such an approach avoids radiation exposure to healthy surrounding tissue. UC Health is contributing $12 million toward the Proton Therapy Center. The Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center/UC Health Proton Therapy Center will include two clinical treatment bays, which are also known as gantries. One will be used to treat children and the other to treat adults. A third gantry will be used for research purposes. Each of the gantries weighs 300 tons, and they were assembled on site. About 100 full-time employees will be added once the proton therapy and research center is operational. Construction began in 2013, and the first patients will be treated in 2017. The Avondale-based hospital opened the Liberty campus in 2008. The proton therapy center project is a joint venture of Messer Construction of Cincinnati and the Linbeck Group of Houston. TK&A Architects of Cambridge, Mass., is handling design work. \nWant Cincinnati Travel  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T21:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T21:47:41.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
