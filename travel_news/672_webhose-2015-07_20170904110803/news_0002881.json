Rugs full of love hearts, garishly coloured stools and original paintings on the wall can be expected. \nThere's also a strong Fairtrade ethos – best seen in the little shop which sells trinkets, souvenirs and artworks from township artists. \nSee backpackers.co.za \nLIVING LOUNGE, LISBON, PORTUGAL \nYour individually designed room at Living Lounge might be painted to look like a silvery woodland, have curtains in the style of a fado singer's scarf or have lights hanging down inside bird cages. It's also sociable at dinnertime and three-course group dinners cost just 10 euros ($14). They also run tip-based \"free\" walking tours. \nSee livingloungehostel.com \nYHA YAMBA, YAMBA, NSW \nPurpose built and smack bang in the middle of Yamba's main street, the lobby/ café bar is a popular hangout for locals too. \nThe rooftop pool and games room with pool table are handy, but it's the activities on offer that stand out. Surfboard and wetsuit hire are bargain-basement cheap, as are the morning surf lessons and raucous Steve Irwin-esque town tours. \nSee yha.com.au \nJUMBOSTAY, STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN \nParked outside Stockholm's Arlanda airport, Jumbostay is as the name suggests – an old Boeing 747-212B that has been converted into dorm-style accommodation. \nThose wanting to splash out and perhaps join the mile-high club are best off with the special suite in the cockpit. \nSee jumbostay.com \nMOSAIC HOUSE, PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC \nMosaic House straddles that line between hostel and design hotel, with the recently refurbished dorm beds all having their own reading lights and storage shelves. The private rooms come with robes, rain showers and huge black and white photos spreading across the back wall. \nThe La Loca bar downstairs, meanwhile, isn't just for cheap beers – it regularly hosts live music gigs – while the hostel also hires out e-bikes and Segways for guests wanting to explore the city the lazy way. \nSee mosaichouse.com \nMONTREAL CENTRAL, MONTREAL, CANADA \nAnother that straddles the hostel/ hotel boundary, Montreal Central's strength is in how it tag-teams with sister hostel, M, a block away. \nThere's a huge emphasis on activities and events, with beer pong competitions, live bands, comedy performances and karaoke nights spread between the two. \nOf the pair, Montreal Central is slightly quieter and more polished.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T03:20:02.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
