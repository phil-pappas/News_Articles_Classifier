Check one off the bucket list in a destination with a reputation for a cheerful and inviting culture as well-known as its stunning landscapes with a stay in real-life medieval Ashford Castle , the crown jewel of Ireland's most iconic hotels. \n\"Ireland is a warm, friendly country with an ancient culture where people are valued, accepted and equal, every guest is consistently treated with this consideration,\" said Catherine Reilly, managing director of Brendan Vacations' Dublin office. \"We live up to our reputation of one hundred thousand welcomes or as we say, 'céad míle fáilte ' (kaid-meela-fallcha). Whether it's an LGBT couple, family or solo traveler, when we're all sitting around a table laughing and sharing a meal or a pint, you quickly realize that we are more similar than we are different. That is the magic of traveling to Ireland.\" \nIreland's referendum makes history as the first country in the world to establish marriage equality through popular vote rather than through legislation or judicial action as with the other 19 countries - a clear indication of the friendly acceptance of a majority of people in Ireland. Same-sex couples residing within the U.S. and choosing destination weddings can now be legally recognized within any of the 50 states because of the recent U.S. Supreme Court marriage equality decision. \n\"A country's support for equality deserves to be rewarded with an increase in LGBT travelers,\" said International Gay & Lesbian Travel Association President/CEO John Tanzella. \"It's wonderful to see our member, Brendan Vacations, creating a new package to celebrate Ireland's historic vote.\" \nA dedicated team of experts with in-depth local knowledge handles guest needs every step of the way on the 10-day Private Chauffeur Romantic Ireland trip from $5,750^ available to book now. Authentic experiences from exclusive connections are featured on this vacation custom-designed around each traveler. This sample itinerary can be personalized to meet guests' needs, accommodating for shorter or longer stays, different stops along the way or off-the-beaten-path activities. \nBrendan introduces guests to instant friends taking you personally within the destination that includes LGBT-friendly hotels and local experts on the new Romantic Ireland trip. \n\"Irish hospitality knows no bounds, it's extended to and experienced by all our guests,\" said Dan Mullane, owner of The Mustard Seed at Echo Lodge, a longtime Brendan featured hotel highlighted on the new itinerary. \"It's always been this way but we are so proud the Irish people voted yes for marriage equality. Nobody blinks an eyelid here, everyone is equal at The Mustard Seed at Echo Lodge. \" \nAdditional luxury hotel accommodations include 800-year-old medieval Ashford Castle , recently re-opened after an extensive renovation. \n\"While Ashford Castle has long been a favorite of LGBT travelers, in the wake of the vote, couples tying the knot or celebrating their honeymoon will be some of the first to experience the properties' completely renovated Victorian and East Wings which house the grandest suites, the elegant George V dining room and Connaught Room,\" said Niall Rochford, Ashford Castle general manager. \nWhat's Included: Sightseeing highlights including Dublin city walking tour in the 200-year-old capital, guided walk to Torc Waterfall, Muckross House and Killarney National Park, Cliffs of Moher scenic cruise and greenway cycle along the Wild Atlantic Way Hand-selected accommodations at four and five-star hotels like The Merrion Hotel, Cliff House Hotel, The Malton Hotel, The Mustard Seed at Echo Lodge, and the luxurious five-star Ashford Castle Breakfast daily and tasting highlights including local produce at the English Market in Cork City, St. Tolas Goat Cheese on its working farm, Irish coffee at Foynes Flying Boat Museum, and a fine dining experience at Ashford Castle Private airport transfers upon arrival and departure in Dublin Transportation in a Mercedes-Benz with a private chauffeur who also serves as a personal guide Free Wi-Fi at hotels (conditions apply) and in private car All ground taxes, service charges and tips for baggage handling \nSample itineraries below featuring other Brendan Vacations trip styles offer a hassle-free tailored experience designed for individual travel preferences including: \nHome of Thrones Self-Drive 8-day vacation from $999^ Charming seaside villages, mysterious landscapes and a ton of filming locations, Northern Ireland is the place to be if you're a fan of the hit cable network show with a record-breaking amount of viewers.
