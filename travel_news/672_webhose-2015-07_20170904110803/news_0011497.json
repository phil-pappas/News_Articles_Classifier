The aircraft was stationary waiting for the aerobridge to be connected. The AAI operator was unable to safely align the aerobridge to the aircraft as he was too fast and thus unable to control its movement. He lost control of the aerobridge causing this unfortunate incident. Customers booked on the onward Chennai-Port Blair flight and those on other subsequent flights, have been re-accommodated on our flights tomorrow or on other airlines. As assessment of the damage is being done, following which further course of action shall be initiated.”\nDGCA has ordered a probe into the incident.\n 2:08 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T15:07:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
