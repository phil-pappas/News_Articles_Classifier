The reports have come from various locations, including in the Deschutes National Forest near the Lava Cast Forest and at a bank building along U.S. Highway 20. \nPandora moths are easy to recognize because of their size and appearance. \nAt rest, the moths form about a 1 1/2-inch triangle, Eglitis said. In flight, they have a wingspan of about 3 inches. Those gray wings have jagged black lines on top and pink on the bottom. The females have thin yellow antennae. The males have feathery antennae of the same hue. \n\"They look like ferns,\" Eglitis said. \nNative to Central Oregon, the pandora moth has a two-year life cycle dependent on pine trees. They munch the trees' needles like mad while they are caterpillars, but they do not cause deadly damage like gypsy moths and other invasive insects, Eglitis said. \nEven during the 1990s outbreak, the moths did not dent Central Oregon's woods. \n\"It was really hard to find any trees that were killed by these things,\" he said. \nThe moths emerge from the ground and fly around this time in odd years. The caterpillars are out eating pine needles in spring and summer of even years. \nWhat triggered the 1990s outbreak, which lasted about a decade and moved through different parts of Central Oregon, is unknown, said Stephen Fitzgerald, a forestry professor at Oregon State University in Corvallis. But scientists do know it was a virus that ended the outbreak around Bend and brought the number of moths back in check. \nInformation from: The Bulletin, http://www.bendbulletin.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T21:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T00:16:38.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
