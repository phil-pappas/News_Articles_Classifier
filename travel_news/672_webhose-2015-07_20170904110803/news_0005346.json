(Photo by Abi Skipp. Used under… more A little more than a year after its grand opening, the John Hancock Center’s Tilt attraction is set to re-open with several changes after closing for a few weeks for renovations. Previously, the Chicago Business Journal’s Lewis Lazare described changes put in place at the tower last month , but now word is coming out about further tweaks to the Tilt, itself. Those changes include a different “motion pattern” , adjustments to the sound system, and adjustments to changing-color lights, Tilt general manager Nichole Williamson told DNAinfo Chicago. More specifically, Williamson told DNAinfo those lights would “change with the mood of the city.” The admission prices Lazare reported in June will remain in place, DNAinfo added, with a base price of $19 to go to 360 Chicago at the top of the Hancock tower, then another $7 to step into the Tilt and look down on the city. Children’s admission to 360 Chicago will remain $13. \nWant Chicago Travel news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
