More Hyatt and Wyndham back Airbnb rivals \nEvergrande , the Chinese property company that co-owns the team with Alibaba , the ecommerce group, said on Thursday it had applied to list the shares on China’s over-the-counter exchange for small companies. \nListing on the National Equities Exchange and Quotations System , known as the “third board”, behind the main Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets, would enhance corporate governance, attract strategic investors and promote its corporate image, the company said. \nFlush with cash from its wealthy owners, Guangzhou Evergrande, which is based in China’s third-largest city, has spearheaded a drive by President Xi Jinping to revolutionise football in the world’s most populous nation. \nIn 2013, the club notched up a significant victory for China when it won the Asian champions’ league, which has long been dominated by teams from bitter rivals Japan and South Korea. \nAlthough football is popular in China, lacklustre performances by the national side and most domestic clubs have been a source of embarrassment. China’s national team ranks 79th in the world, behind minnows such as Haiti, Togo and the United Arab Emirates. \nAnalysts say Chinese tycoons have rushed to invest in football at home and abroad to ingratiate themselves with President Xi, who has released a national plan to transform China’s footballing reputation. \nGuangzhou Evergrande, Chinese league champions, last month signed Luiz Felipe Scolari, the former Brazilian national coach, as manager, and Paulinho, the Brazilian midfielder, completed a $15m transfer from Tottenham Hotspur, the English Premiership side. Robinho, his national team mate and former Manchester City striker, has also been linked to a move to the club. ©AFP Former Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari arriving in Guangzhou in June \nBut Guangzhou Evergrande has taken a more serious approach to building its business in China, trying to follow the lead of British clubs such as Manchester United and Arsenal, which see themselves as consumer brands as much as football clubs. \n“Politics has had a massive influence on investment into football in China, but Evergrande is a bit different,” said Christopher Atkins, who writes about Chinese football for ESPN, the US sports network. “From a business perspective, they understand that the real estate market won’t keep growing forever and they’re using football to help promote their brand as they branch out into other industries, like bottled water and cooking oil.” \nAlthough they are planning to list their equity, Guangzhou Evergrande’s investors are not selling any shares at this stage. Last year Jack Ma’s Alibaba bought a 50 per cent stake in the club for Rmb1.2bn ($193m), although Evergrande subsequently bought back 10 per cent to give it 60 per cent ownership. \nRowan Simons, who promotes grassroots football in China , said that Guangzhou Evergrande has also brought a more professional approach to the sport, building the world’s biggest soccer school among other initiatives. \n“They have led a change in thinking in Chinese football from when match fixing and gambling were the main priorities to winning being the main priority,” said Mr Simons, author of Bamboo Goalposts , a book about football in China. “They’ve done it by spending a huge amount of money to sign the best players from China and around the world.” \nBut he warned that most Chinese clubs have “no possibility of ever breaking even on these investments” because of the low fees paid by state-owned broadcasters to show games, and their inability to raise additional income from events and corporate hospitality at state-owned stadiums.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T15:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T22:42:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
