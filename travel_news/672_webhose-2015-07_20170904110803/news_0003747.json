Angie James, the ag teacher and FFA instructor at St. James HS, has long been a catalyst for Ag in Motion, and she said six students from St. James High School, along with two more from Madelia High School, made this trip. Though Madelia students have been part of every Ag in Motion trip, this was the first year for St. James students--Sydney Holland, Nora Schmidt, Jadyn Anderson, Zach Orvis, Derrick Beilke, and Brandon Hjelmer. James said Colorado came highly recommended, “there’s lots to do,” and, perhaps most crucially, it’s far enough away from here to lure students, but not so far as to make the trip financially untenable. James and her cohorts have learned that the farther away the destination, the more students want to be involved. Colorado was the farthest they’ve yet ventured, but it wasn’t cost-prohibitive, James said. “The Watonwan County Corn and Soybean Growers were very generous, and donated $2,000 to cover the overall cost of the trip for all of the students.” On the Colorado trip in late June, students were able to tour the stadium of the Denver Broncos, go hiking, spend time at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre, go whitewater rafting, spend time in the animal science area at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, tour the U.S. Mint in Denver, go on a Miller-Coors Brewery tour in Golden, and take in a Colorado Rockies vs. Arizona Diamondbacks baseball game at Coors Field.
