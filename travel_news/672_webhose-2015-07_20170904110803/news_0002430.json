Photo by John Fischer, licensed to About.com \nFor most of the last two decades during which I have written about Hawaii, the Turtle Bay Resort and its adjoining lands have been the topic of major political as well as visitor industry controversy. \nDuring that period a state of hostility has often existed between the property owners, management, workers and local community - often pitting one or more of these entities against the other(s). \nProposed expansion of the property has long been a hot topic for locals and their cultural and political allies. \nWhen I first stayed at the resort, over ten years ago, much of the staff was on strike as part of a long-term dispute with management. It seemed like these tensions would never end. \nNew Ownership \nIn February of 2010 new ownership took possession of the property and brought in their representatives to handle property and resort management Vancouver-based Replay Resorts . \nOver the last few years the new owners and their management partners have worked hard to make peace with the very diverse local community, state government legislators and lobbyists as well as their own staff. \nPrivate-Public Partnership for Conservation \nFinally in the summer if 2014 a $48.5 million agreement was reached between Turtle Bay Ownership and the State of Hawaii, by which the owners agreed significantly to reduce the amount if land that will be developed and the state and people of Hawaii secured a conservation easement on 665.8 acres of land, the use of which will be permanently limited in order to protect the ecological, recreational and open space characteristics of the North Shore. \nThere will, however, be development of other portions of the property. \nMedia Invited to Experience Resort’s Rebirth \nIn October of 2014, the resort hosted a large group of international media, including myself, to celebrate the official celebration of the resort's re-launch following not only significant upgrades to the property but also the beginning of a new, more visitor and local community supportive mindset. \nThe new management team worked very hard to get the message of their new vision across to us over the course of several days. Without downplaying their efforts, however, their message came across best when they allow the beauty of the resort and its surrounding area as well as their on-site staff to speak for themselves. \nIn a marked change from my visit of over 10 years ago, most staff seem generally happy and content with management and the new direction for the property. As someone who makes a point to speak with workers ranging from valet and bell staff, front desk staff, housekeeping as well as bartenders and restaurant servers, I can definitely say that there is a positive vibe going forward. \nSome labor relations issues are still pending, but none of these are sensed by guests and management is optimistic that these will be resolved. \nNew management is an interesting combination of successful Canadian developers as well as a number of long term North Shore residents. Their advisory staff consists of some of the iconic names in North Shore culture and water sports. As odd as that combination may seem, they all seem to share a joint vision for where they want the resort to be within the next few years. \nIt's hard to complain about their vision for activities and events which will engage the entire north shore community. \nChallenges Still Remain \nChallenges remain ahead as the proposed development begins. There will be those opposed to more hotel rooms, long term rentals, increased traffic and the impact on the existing environment. A degree of protest is common with any development in Hawaii. \nThe property's new managers are smart people who have a detailed, planned strategy and cohesive company line that comes through in most discussions with them. If nothing else, they share a very common vision. \nAs one who has watched these developments at Turtle Bay for almost 20 years, I'd like to believe that the promises I heard are promises which will be kept. I really want to believe that they will be. \nI recognize, however, that the investors bought a property to make money - as is their right. Will the activists on the North Shore accept their plans and a happy median come to exist between all parties? I suppose only time will tell. \nI, for one, will be watching with great interest. \nComing Soon \nIn Part 2 of this series we’ll take a closer look at the six core values by which Turtle Bay operates and serves their guests . \nThen in Part 3, we'll look at the six guiding principles, or pillars , that encompass the rebrand of this North Shore resort. \nFinally, we’ll look in detail at the numerous activities available to guests of the resort. \nWe’ll also take a special flight on the iconic Magnum P.I. helicopter now flying from Paradise Helicopter’s location at Turtle Bay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T00:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T07:30:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
