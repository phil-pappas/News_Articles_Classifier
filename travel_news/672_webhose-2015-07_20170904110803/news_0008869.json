Envisioned by the award-winning designer Joanna Cooke, the private house features two en suite rooms with adjoining en suite children’s rooms and bathrooms. The abode was named after Nomad founder Mkombe Mniko, a guide who cherished introducing families to the wonders of nature. The home—which accommodates 10—is ideal for families who want to experience the majestic African plains firsthand. \nResort amenities include a private dining room and lounge, a swimming pool and children’s pool, and outdoor spaces that offer one-of-a-kind views of the African bush. An array of helpful staff—including a housekeeper, chauffeur, housekeeper, waiter/butler, and guard—cater to every whim. Guests can coordinate daily menus with the in-house chef, who utilizes fresh local produce and ingredients to craft authentic Tanzanian cuisine. Personal safari guides plan individualized itineraries for families, guiding them across the grassland plains to spot buffalo, wildebeests, elephants, lions, crocodiles, and other African wildlife. Other popular activities include picnicking on the plains and stargazing on the outdoor “star bed” for stunning views of the heavens. Nightly prices start at $625 per person with a minimum of four adults.
