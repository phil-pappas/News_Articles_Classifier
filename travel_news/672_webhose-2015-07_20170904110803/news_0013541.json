Here are some of the most recent travel blunders. Travel Alberta: Alberta's tourism marketing agency apologized for overlooking Canada's largest territory. In a June 2015 advertisement promoting the ease and affordability of travelling to Alberta from major American cities such as Los Angeles, Houston and Chicago, the map of Canada used by Travel Alberta is missing the border lines for Nunavut. Travel Alberta promptly admitted the design error and apologized. Read the full story here. (Supplied Photo) \nTourism Prince Edward Island: Up for a visit to Prince Edward Island? The man on the 2015 P.E.I. visitor's guide certainly looks like he is! A photo of a man and woman lounging on the beaches of the island province raised eyebrows on social media when residents started sharing the cover photo, saying it looked like the man was sexually aroused. Tourism P.E.I. had printed more than 180,000 copies of the guide, BuzzFeed reports, and has already changed the cover photo on the online version of the guide. Read the full story here.

The ad has since gone viral on Twitter, with many users calling out Air Canada for suggesting Atlantic Canada was a separate country. Read the full story here. (Twitter) \nAll Nippon Airways: A travel campaign for Japanese airline All Nippon Airways was pulled after being criticized for using 'whiteface' and having racist overtones. In the commercial promoting the range of destinations available to fly to from Tokyo, two Japanese businessmen talk about changing the image of Japan before one dons a blonde wig and a big nose. \"Our intention was to show Japanese becoming more active and essential to the world,\" a spokesperson said.

The government launched a sexy ad campaign and even funded a steamy photo shoot for Maxim magazine. An Israeli ad agency similarly decided to promote the country with a racy ad considered by some to be offensive to women. The accompanying slogan - \"No Wonder it's called the Holy Land\" - likely didn't sit well with religious groups either. (YouTube) \nTurkey: Oscar winner Julianne Moore was reportedly dropped as the face of a new tourism campaign in Turkey. The star agreed to shoot a short promotional film for government officials in 2014, but representatives at the Culture and Tourism Ministry were reportedly unhappy with the footage. Ministry sources claim the ads were scrapped as a result of Moore’s “poor acting” during the shoot. Read the full story here.

The Sports Illustrated 50th anniversary film featured half-naked women explaining safety procedures. A petition on Change.org calling for the video to be removed had more than 7,000 signatures. The airline denied it pulled the video due to public pressure. Read the full story here. (Air New Zealand) \nThailand: A new ad promoting tourism in Thailand ended up being more creepy than inspiring. In the commercial, a lonely man begins following a woman around Thailand after seeing her photos on Instagram and becoming determined to meet her. They eventually do meet and begin to travel together. See the video here. (YouTube) \nNew York City: In 2014, New York City announced Taylor Swift, a native of Pennsylvania, would be the new face of the city around the world. Many New Yorkers and media commentators were disgruntled about the choice of spokesperson, including Sex and the City star Chris Noth, who said Swift represented the wealthy elite of Manhattan. Singer Billy Joel eventually stepped up to defend Swift , telling USA Today \"Let her in. That's what New York is all about. I say, 'Welcome'... I think she's a talented songwriter.\" (New York City Tourism) \nIsrael: Israeli supermodel Bar Refaeli has hit out at officials in her home country after she was criticized for starring in a new tourism campaign without completing her mandatory military service. Refaeli reportedly avoided being drafted into the Israeli armed forces as her modelling career was beginning to take off by exploiting a loophole in the law which meant married women would be exempt from the two-year stint, which is compulsory for men and women over the age of 18. She allegedly wed a family friend and then filed for divorce once she had been given exemption from the military. Read the full story here.
