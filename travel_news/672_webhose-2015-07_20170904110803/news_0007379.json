Ian Botham smoking a fat cigar; a glowing Michael Vaughan wearing a grin as wide as the M62; Allan Border holding a tinny of Castlemaine XXXX in one hand and the Ashes urn in the other. But what does a dressing room look like after defeat? A defeat as comprehensive and catastrophic as, say, England’s by 405 runs at Lord’s? “It was quite quiet,” Stuart Broad reflects with the benefit of a few days’ distance. “Cricket’s a really big team sport, but individually it’s so obvious when you’ve had a bad game, a lot of the players were internally thinking: ‘What have I done this week that’s been so wrong? How can I put that right for Edgbaston?’ ” There were no recriminations or post-mortems after Lord’s, no blazing rows or punitive double training sessions. Instead, new coach Trevor Bayliss simply told everyone to go away and forget about cricket for a few days. “There were still a lot of emotional people in the changing room,” Broad explains. “The chat would have been frustrated rather than constructive.” Bouncing back: Stuart Broad recovered from defeat by playing golf So Broad went home to Nottingham and buried himself in one of his other passions. He spent Monday watching the final round of the Open golf with Graeme Swann, and felt a sudden urge to dig his clubs out again. “It gave me the bug,” he says. “I went up to The Belfry on Wednesday to play with [Nottinghamshire team-mates] Michael Lumb and Dan Christian. Actually, Ian Bell was up there as well with Chris Woakes and Brendon McCullum, all having a hit.” Golf has always been something of an escape for Broad. Earlier this year he read a book called The Unstoppable Golfer by Bob Rotella, the psychologist who helped Darren Clarke win the Open in 2011, which gave him a new insight into performing under pressure. But it serves a more therapeutic function, too. Andrew Strauss once observed that watching cricketers play golf is often a revealing insight into their character. “Stuart Broad,” he wrote, “just wants to hit the ball as hard as he can. He doesn’t mind how many shots it takes to get the ball in the hole. For him, it’s an ego trip to say he can hit the ball further than anyone else.” So while his team-mates decompress by spending time with the family or working on their suntans, Broad whacks the hell out of golf balls. It is easily forgotten now, but midway through the 2009 Ashes series, Broad was struggling, and there were rumours that he might be close to the axe. So after the third Test he treated himself to a short break in Loch Lomond with his father Chris: playing a few rounds, generally trying to think about cricket as little as possible. Refreshed and recharged, he went on to take six wickets at Headingley and five at the Oval to win the series. The hope is that golf can do the trick again. “In Ashes series it’s so crucial to be mentally and physically fresh,” Broad says. “Trevor just said: ‘Look, have three or four days relaxing as much as you can.’ \"It’s crucial that we don’t get to Edgbaston still hung over or fearing what happened at Lord’s. We need to be quite clear that we performed badly, but this is a new week.” Broad has no easy answers for England’s capitulation at Lord’s, just days after winning so handsomely in Cardiff. } Concerned: Stuart Broad with captain Alastair Cook at Lord's But he is clear that while England neither batted nor bowled well enough, the placidity of the surface made it a crucial toss to win . Australia won it, and ended the first day 337 for one. With hindsight, it is tempting to say that the game was already gone at that point. “By day two the wicket had quickened up,” Broad says. “We beat the bat more, we got edges. Whereas on the first day, it was just dead. \"The groundsman was quite conscious that he’d over-prepared it. I don’t think it was ready before the game. Edgbaston and Trent Bridge are generally pitches that are more fun to watch cricket on. “I’m not moaning about the Lord’s wicket, because it’s the same for both teams. But both teams want to play fun, exciting cricket, and you want the pitches to match that. If I’m paying to watch, I want to see nicks, I want to see dropped catches, I want to see boundaries. \"I don’t want to see the ball bouncing twice to the wicketkeeper. You want to be able to play fun cricket that excites the world. It’s quite hard to do that on pitches like Lord’s.” None of which quite explains the fact that England were bowled out for 103 on the fourth evening. There was a familiar architect to their downfall: Mitchell Johnson, who finished with match figures of six for 80. Amid all the talk of reopened wounds, Broad insists that the ghosts of the previous series have already been laid. “The conditions are very different,” he says. “Back in 2013-14, where Johnson got 37 wickets, he probably bowled as well as any bowler in the history of the game. \"I don’t think he’s bowling as well as he did then, but he’s obviously had great success at Lord’s. Guys who haven’t faced much of him find it a bit different. \"The Aussies used him well. He only bowled short spells, so you don’t get time to really settle in against him.” Interactive: England stats after Lord's Broad reckons that it was England, rather than Johnson, who were most culpable for their defeat. “In the first innings especially, the 10 wickets we lost, they weren’t good balls. We gave them 10 wickets, and in Test match cricket you’ve got to make teams work hard for their wickets. “I think when we get to Edgbaston you’ll see a very determined, steely, skilful batting line-up for England. I think it’ll be a big change from Lord’s.” Naturally, it will take more than fighting talk to blunt Australia’s psychological edge, but Broad believes that England’s Midlands strongholds can swing things their way. “Let’s not forget that Edgbaston and Trent Bridge [the venue for the fourth Test] are two fantastic grounds for the England cricket team,” he says. “We should have a lot of confidence. The last Test I played at Edgbaston, Cooky got 294 [against India in 2011] and we won by an innings.” It is always interesting to study athletes in the wake of defeat. Generally they will be full of positive words about picking themselves up and bouncing back, but often their demeanour gives them away. Broad, on the other hand, has suffered enough heavy defeats and crippling setbacks to know a disaster when he sees one. This is not it. “It’s a huge week,” he says. “I read somewhere that England haven’t won the third Ashes Test since 1981, which has got to change. A lot has been written this week about it being the end of the world, like we’re losing 10-0. \"But actually, it’s 1-1. They’ve played fantastically one week, we’ve played fantastically one week. Let battle commence.” Stuart Broad surprised online shoppers by making grocery deliveries for Waitrose in Nottinghamshire on Friday. Waitrose are sponsors of England cricket.
