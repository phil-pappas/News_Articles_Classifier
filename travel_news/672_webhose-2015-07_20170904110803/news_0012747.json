She asks: I want to open a pop-up shop. How do I go about this? Business expert Rachel Bridge replies: Pop-up shops are temporary shops that can be set up in any kind of empty space for a day, a few days or a few weeks. There are now more than 10,000 of them in the UK, and last year between them they sold goods worth £2.1 billion. Pop-up shops can appear in empty retail premises or in non-traditional venues – anything from a village hall to a garage. Businesses like them because they are cheap and low risk, and customers like them because they feel they are getting something unique. To find a space for your pop-up, there are several online portals that connect would-be pop-ups with vacant space – check out thestorefront.com , wearepopup.com and appearhere.co.uk . Choose somewhere that is easy to find, has other relevant retail businesses nearby and lots of people walking past. Make sure there is parking and public transport nearby too. When you sign the lease, ensure your repair obligations are limited to returning the premises to the landlord in a clean and tidy condition – you don’t want to be landed with expensive repair bills for long-term problems. To publicise your pop-up, contact local newspapers, bloggers and get busy on social media. On the opening day itself hand out flyers. And make sure you have a lot of helpers to work the tills and get a mobile payment system. If possible, work out a way of collecting email addresses from everyone who visits the shop – by holding a competition, perhaps – so you can stay in touch with them after your pop-up has closed down. Kathy McArdle is chief executive of Nottingham’s Creative Quarter , home to independent cafés, boutiques, vintage stores and design shops. Her team recently launched the CQ Pop-UP Centre and “Made in Nottingham” pop-up in Broadmarsh Shopping Centre. She adds: You must understand why you want to open a pop-up – yes, it’s a cool and exciting idea, but be clear on the overall benefits to your business. Having clarified this, ensure you’re ready for the realities of running the shop itself. Make sure you know the terms and conditions of your venue’s licence and get some advice before signing. You need to be clear about what your liabilities are from the outset. Consider everything from insurance and staffing to the processing of sales. It’s worth getting an iZettle machine so you can take card payments as well as cash. Identity is key so plan your branding carefully to ensure that you pop up with a bang and maximise the footfall to your shop. This needs to be supported through strong local PR and social media and it’s worth considering a launch event or special promotion to generate a buzz. Finally, enjoy it. It could be the best thing you ever do for your business. Nikki Rooke, head of corporate communications, events and sponsorship at Volvo Car UK, which has used pop-up shops in shopping centres to tell people about their cars, also says: Pop-up shops were a great way to engage potential customers that might not otherwise visit a Volvo showroom. We set out to create a Swedish-inspired, relaxed environment where people could get to know our latest models in a no-pressure, friendly setting. We wanted to show what the Volvo brand meant, as well as the cars we sold. By going to high-footfall shopping centres and taking our cars to where people are, we created a unique opportunity to speak to a whole new set of prospects, adding Volvo to their consideration list for their next car purchase. • Whether you’ve got a pop-up or a bricks-and-mortar shop, the right company car, financed in the best way, will make good business sense.
