The combined reservations, airport check-in, ticketing, inventory management system, and eCommerce will usher in a new era for Caribbean Airlines and its customers as part of the airlines’ overall customer-centric strategy.\nBy unifying these systems, every customer touch point will be consolidated with the ability to provide comprehensive real-time information. Also, a more versatile website would enable passengers to better manage their travel experience.\n“Amadeus is a leading technology partner for the global travel industry which provides reliable, modern and cutting edge solutions to over 120 airlines worldwide. Caribbean Airlines is thrilled to have signed this important contract to become a strategic partner with them. Given the fiercely competitive nature of the airline industry, this acquisition is a good commercial tool to compete against formidable airlines” stated George Reeleder, CAL’s Vice President Commercial Operations.\n“An integrated IT platform provides unique capabilities and efficiencies for airlines seeking to stand out against the competition in a busy marketplace, and we are delighted that, following a thorough evaluation of available solutions, Caribbean Airlines has chosen to partner with Amadeus to benefit from the industry-leading Amadeus Altéa Suite,” said John Dabkowski, VP Airline Commercial, Amadeus.\nDabkowski continued: “Our next-generation technology will enable Caribbean Airlines to deliver its vision for a customer-centric travel experience, and we look forward to working together to achieve this.”\nBy March 2016, Caribbean Airlines expects to complete the full migration. The first phase will be finished by the end of November 2015.\nSource:- Amadeus\nRelated Posts Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building TripAdvisor touches mark of 100 million downloads for free app for iPhone and Android Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium AERTiCKET extends strategic partnership with Amadeus to bolster its global expansion plans Blacklane and Amadeus partner to deliver the first true door-to-door travel experience for all points of sale", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T11:27:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
