Shuffling the world's greatest chefs around the world\nFor foodies, there could be few gastronomic experiences more exciting than sampling a unique, unrepeatable meal.\nHalfway around the world in Paris, where chef David Thompson is dishing up Thai-inspired French cuisine at Alain Ducasse's opulent Plaza Athénée restaurant, the diners are equally as privileged.\nAs are the punters at the 35 other restaurants across the globe participating in the global Grand Gelinaz! Shuffle .\nOrchestrated by Andea Petrini and Alexandra Swenden, founder-curators of Gelinaz!, a cooperative of culinary adventurers, the transcontinental shuffle required 37 chefs to commit to trading kitchens for a few exhilarating days.\nUpon landing in their destination, their mission was to get a crash course on the restaurant's cuisine before creating a degustation menu of dishes made with the local ingredients.\nChefs were assigned randomly and diners, who bought tickets via the Gelinaz! website, kept in the dark until they were seated (or at least they would've been had it not been for social media leaks).\nSenior members of the Nahm and Noma teams play up to the camera for a video to announce which mystery chef was in the Bangkok kitchen. It was meant to be a secret that it was Redzepi, however, rumours had already spread around town. Pulling 37 chefs out of their comfort zones\nPerhaps not surprisingly, many of the diners at Nahm were chefs and restaurateurs from Bangkok and beyond, making for a kitchen of nervous young cooks fearing failure.\nBut, as Redzepi told his team at Nahm, that's exactly what the Gelinaz! Shuffle is about.\n\"This day is about collaboration, we have to find a way to collaborate,\" he said. \"It's also about learning new things. It's about taking risks. Everybody opens up their kitchens, no secrets, just come and explore.\"\nHe added that although failure was an option, it shouldn't stop guests from having a good time.\nChef René Redzepi gives a pep talk to the team about the philosophy behind the Gelinaz! project as many of the Nahm staff were unaware of just how many of the world's best chefs had swapped restaurants on this day. The possibility of failure had been on Redzepi's mind for a few days -- and not only because of the risky nature of the venture.\nThe chefs were cooking with ingredients they'd never used in countries they'd never been and kitchens they'd never used, staffed by teams who communicated in languages they didn't understand.\nRedzepi said he took comfort in the fact that 36 other chefs were facing the same challenges.\n\"It really is a forced learning experience,\" Redzepi told CNN.\n\"Gelinaz! is all about encouraging creativity, collaboration and experimentation, and really pushing culinary boundaries.\"\nIf the event wasn't nerve-wracking enough, just hours before he was due to fly out of Copenhagen Redzepi's wife was rushed to hospital and into emergency surgery with a burst appendix.\nHe stayed behind to wait until she was out of danger, sending his two sous-chefs, Dane Thomas Frebel and Australian Beau Clugston in his place.\nA Nahm chef takes a photo of the finished soft shell crab with aubergine soup. It was standing room only in the packed kitchen as Nahm chefs jostled excitedly to see what the Danish cooks had done with Thai ingredients. Over the next two days they treated the Nahm kitchen like a laboratory, testing and experimenting with ingredients, checking in with Redzepi by phone.\nBy the time their boss arrived in Bangkok on the day of the event, Frebel and Clugston had finalized the menu.\nRedzepi listened patiently as Frebel and Clugston talked him through it, only showing concern at the mention of pork crackling in a dessert.\nHe didn't demand a change, despite a collegial phone call from Paris in which a cheeky David Thompson urged Redzepi to change the entire menu to put his staff through their paces.\nCall concluded, Redzepi passed on Thompson's best wishes to the team.\n\"David's ready. He's doing a curry sole... he's happy about that one,\" Redzepi reported back.\n\"I really want to see what he does to Alain Ducasse's restaurant. David said he wants to be here to see what's happening. I feel the same. I want to be at my restaurant too.\"\n\"They're tough critics\"\nDespite Thompson's mischievous idea, Redzepi gave his blessing to the menu.\n\"If I interfere at this point, I know I'm going to mess up everything,\" he said. \"I know I'll probably want to go in and change quite a few things. But they are the two people I work closest with so I don't doubt that we have something that represents what we do. I can see that on the menu.\"\nThree hours later, after the first sitting of diners were nearing the end of their meals, and Redzepi had delivered scores of dishes to tables, the chef returned to the kitchen, somewhat baffled and slightly exasperated by the silence in the dining room.\nAmong the 15 courses served were \"soft shell crab with aubergine\" (left) and \"corn with nahm pla raa.\" We watched Nahm's waiters hurry by us, transporting trays of stunning dishes from the pass to the dining room -- dishes like the opening course of \"green mango, coconut flesh,\" a palate-cleanser with the multifarious textures of Thai desserts that local diners adore.\nThe gelatinous flesh of young coconut, cooked and dried chewy seaweed, and a granita made from jasmine flowers, swam in the clear juice of green unripe mango, served in a half coconut shell sitting on a bed of crushed ice.\nIt was surprising, delicious and delightful, as were 14 out of the 15 courses.\nOnly one course disappointed -- an \"unripe watermelon\" that wasn't as pickled as intended.\nYet Redzepi reported back to the kitchen that he'd received very little feedback and that diners had been quiet.\n\"Nobody has said anything about the food. They're tough critics,\" he said, shaking his head.\n\"It was always going to be a risk. This business is all about expectations and who knew what their expectations were. Maybe they thought they were going to eat a Noma meal. The most important thing is, this is a learning experience.\"\nWhile there were plenty of offers to take the visiting chefs out for a night on the town, Redzepi and the Noma boys opted to celebrate with the Nahm chefs at a modest local Thai place with fried chicken, grilled pork, beer and local rum. After the last diners had left and the kitchen had been scrubbed clean, Redzepi, Frebel and Clugston eschewed a VIP after-party to join the young Nahm cooks for cold beers, Thai whiskey and Isaan (northeastern Thai) street food at a rustic neon-lit family eatery down the road.\nAll doubts appeared to have been wiped from the chef's mind.\nRedzepi sat down, after having personally congratulated every one of the proud young cooks, exchanged bear hugs, posed for group photos, and even received a peck on the cheek from a petite Thai chef who gushed that the experience had been the highlight of her life.\nHe grinned happily, sipped his beer, and said, \"This is what it's all about.\"\nGot photos of your own Culinary Journeys to share?
