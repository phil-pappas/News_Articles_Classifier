By 2020, the government aims to increase the number of foreign students in Japan by 50 % to invigorate international exchanges.\nThe panel will compile measures by around September to increase the number of foreign elementary, junior high and high school students on educational tours to Japan from the 44,000 in the year to March 2014 to the targeted level. The panel will discuss how to nurture coordinators between communities and foreign schools to arrange such programs. The Japan Tourism Agency suggested a plan to organise seminars for schools and travel agencies in other countries to provide a better understanding of the benefits of studying in Japan.\nForeign students on educational tours to Japan are mostly from Taiwan, South Korea and the United States at present and study largely in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagano.\nRelated Posts Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium ‘Earn While you Learn’ Programme – India Kerala Tourism to host roadshows across Australia and New Zealand PROMPERÚ to tap Indian travel market UK-based tour operator offers weekend trip to other side of planet", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T23:48:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
