United Airlines CEO Jeff Smisek must have just seen the results… more A sliver of good news has come for United Airlines (NYSE: UAL) in the wake of the airline's hugely-disruptive computer glitch and nationwide ground stop yesterday. Tenet Partners, a New York City-based brand innovation and marketing consultancy, has just released its list of the 15 most powerful travel and entertainment brands based on a new survey of thousands of America's top corporate executives. While United did not score at the top of the rankings (the news isn't that good!), the Chicago-based carrier did wind up in sixth place with a composite \"BrandPower Score\" of 49.0. That put United behind No. 5 on the list, archrival American Airlines , which had a BrandPower Score of 51.0, but ahead of No. 7 Delta Air Lines (47.1) and No. 8 Southwest Airlines (41.9). The BrandPower Score is based on survey respondents' familiarity with the brand and on the brand's favorability. The favorability score is determined by three factors — overall reputation, perception of management and investment potential. Some critics of United's performance in recent years might argue the airline should have been scored quite low on favorability, at least according to the Tenet survey parameters. But there's no arguing the United brand is a widely familiar one. Aside from top-scoring Walt Disney (75.8), Hilton Hotels (63.4) was No. 2 on the list, followed by Marriott International (56.5) in third place and — are you ready for this? — the Trump Organization (51.8) in fourth place. Say what you will about the Donald, the man has long maintained he is a businessman first and foremost. Clearly corporate America has some respect for what Trump's accomplished in the hotel and entertainment arenas. The Tenet survey results are based on responses from 10,000 elite business decision makers in top American corporations. \nWant Chicago Media & Marketing news in your inbox?
