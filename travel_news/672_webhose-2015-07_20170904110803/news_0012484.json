Designs with mukaish work from Rangmahal in Lahore to digital prints of India Gate — Pakistani designer Huma Nassr is all set to unleash designs from across the border in the city. Call it an olive branch wrapped in swanky couture, Nassr is planning an event, ‘Shaan-e-Pakistan’ that promises to be much more than just a display of style by various designers from Pakistan.“Apart from offering a taste of Pakistani fashion, the event is about empowerment too. Women weavers and handicraft workers, rarely realise the worth of their exquisite handiwork. Since most of the designers use hand embroidery, this will be a good opportunity for these artisans to get exposure,” says Huma, whose love affair with India began seven years ago and never really ended. Even her label, Braahtii, is an amalgam of Marwari ‘brahatam’ and ‘brahati’ from Rawalpindi. Speaking to us about her ‘never-ending mesmiration with Rajasthan’ at her cosy outlet in the city, she proudly says, “Many Pakistani designers are collabrating on multi-labels here, but I am perhaps the first Pakistani entrepreneur in India.” Her recent ‘Wagah’ collection offers a couture spin on burkhas, abayas, namaaz chadars, as well as modern outfits with Multani tarkashi and ralli embroidery. She also has a word of praise for an Indian designer. “I know he will not be too pleased but I want to be the Manish Malhotra of Pakistan,” she says.
