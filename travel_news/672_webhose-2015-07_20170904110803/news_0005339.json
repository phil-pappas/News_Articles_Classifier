This is a routine I used to enjoy, and yet the older I become the more I feel deeply and symbiotically attached to my pyjamas. Mostly I try to avoid looking at myself in the mirror until I’m properly dressed. Silly, isn’t it? I blame the Younger Me in that damned photograph for causing a reaction of mild shock should I catch sight of my 59-year-old reflection. I’m not so hung up that I chew my nails to bits every morning in a frenzy of self-loathing, because I do, on the whole, quite like myself and think that I’m doing all right, but what’s there on the outside is at odds with how I imagine myself on the inside. I look at pictures of Younger Me in nineteen eighty-something and see a pretty young woman who I recall never believed she was pretty. That’s something I hear a lot from women of my generation . Bridget Jones spent her time relaxing in her pyjamas (REX) I wonder sometimes whether it would have made any difference to the decisions she made if she’d known it. I feel sad that she didn’t know it. But to keep trying to second-guess such things is pointless and depressing... that way madness lies. It’s best to just let it go and smile at the silliness of her and at all the thought-less fun she had, because once she was me, and somewhere inside myself I am still her. Anyway, I digress. But it seems to me that it’s becoming almost impossible to balance these two selves, dress appropriately (whatever that is) , and leave the house looking halfway decent. Observing how other women do it I’ve noticed that quite a few my age adopt a sort of uniform. It’s usually trouser-based with a loose top or shirt and never, on any account, do these women tuck something into a waistband. By and large they are right. Waistbands in particular are the enemy of the middle-aged. As a middle-aged woman it can be hard to know where one’s waist is. Even if you’re stick-thin your waist will have migrated. I took my eye off my waist for a couple of months when I was 45 and it moved. It’s what they do. I finally recognise what I’ve known all along: that no one except me gives a damn anyway. Helen Walmsley-Johnson Knees undergo a similar metamorphosis. I grieve for the smooth knees of my youth: firm knees, knees that I could kneel on, silent knees, knees that made it possible to wear a chic hemline with bare legs. Or shorts. God, I miss shorts and by that I mean proper shorts, not the mid-length variety that are usually teamed with a sun visor and a bum bag. Living my life energetically via the mediums of dancing , riding and childrearing has rendered my knees unsuitable for polite company. Dancing and riding both employ knees in major ways and, inconveniently, in different directions: ballet dictates the knees are turned out while riding demands they are turned in. Thanks in no small part to this I now have only semi-functional knees, and semi-functional knees are, I suspect, largely responsible for my falling off a kerb in Kensington High Street, in broad daylight, without having touched anything stronger than a chai latte. Falling off a kerb at 51 – the shame! – damaged my dignity, my left knee and frightened a taxi driver half to death. Fortunately, internal knee wear is invisible to the casual observer (unless unintentionally revealed by slow and awkward rising from the kneeling or seated position gripping tightly to any conveniently located weight-bearing structure) but one of the most significant ageing benchmarks, the wrinkled knee, is not. Are any of us prepared for the shock of the wrinkled knee? I know the Younger Me was not. Wrinkled knees are, after all, the clear outward sign that one’s skin is losing its youthful elasticity, like a puckered, deflating balloon. I regard my own battered knees with a mournful sadness and think ‘ thank heaven for 100 denier black opaque tights ’. With black opaque tights the on-the-knee dress is again an option during autumn and winter, and possibly a little bit of spring. Perhaps even up until the end of April, which is a good seven months’ worth all told. Hallelujah. Not that it matters too much for we invisible women because it seems no one wants to take our photographs anyway, least of all us. Helen Walmsley-Johnson These days deciding what to wear is a right old faff but often a great deal easier than actually putting the stuff on; just try putting on socks or tights when you have sciatica , or fastening a bra when you have a frozen shoulder. For an entire year I was condemned to wear only one particular tartan frock because a frozen shoulder meant I couldn’t zip anything else up and pride wouldn’t allow me to ask a colleague to do it after I’d arrived at work because that would have felt like the Beginning of the End. I endured sixteen months of agony and physiotherapy to get my shoulder working again, only to be told that frozen shoulders often happen randomly at my age and will eventually put themselves right after about eighteen months. If I’d known that I could have saved myself no end of bother. Getting dressed can feel like a mission (Getty) Back in the days when I could look good in almost anything (Younger Me again) getting dressed and deciding which character I would be today was a pleasure. Now it’s almost too hard – a tough NATO-like negotiation involving tactical manoeuvring and a compromise before I can get started on everything else. I find it a struggle to decide which of my ageing bits and pieces are the more socially acceptable (and therefore merit exposure) and which might require a quick scrutiny of the Daily Mail ‘Sidebar of Shame’ to verify that fact. Do I want to be visible or would I rather fade into the background? Why is it apparently beyond the wit of man and fashion designers to create clothes for women with more than half a metre of fabric between neckline and hemline? Or that look good on someone other than a fourteen-year-old giraffe? If I can fudge something together from my wardrobe, there can be no such obfuscation where my face is concerned. Everyone looks at everyone else’s face and everyone notices the smallest mistake, except me and perhaps other women in their middle years who find their eyesight is thankfully less efficient. I like make-up. I like eyeliner and scarlet lipstick. However it’s becoming increasingly difficult to get everything in the right place and then persuade it to stay there rather than wandering off around my face before an important meeting. No one used to worry too much about this in the ’70s but now apparently we must look box fresh and photo ready at every minute of the day. Not that it matters too much for we invisible women because it seems no one wants to take our photographs anyway, least of all us. Which sort of makes it all right not to worry, I suppose; only I do... I do.There are vexing decisions to be made every day before I finally recognise what I’ve known all along: that no one except me gives a damn anyway.
