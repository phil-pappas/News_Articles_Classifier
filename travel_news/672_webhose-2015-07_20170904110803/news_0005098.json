She started painting scenes of 20 t h century plantation life in her 50s. She often included imaginary animals such as the \"gooster,\" a combination of a rooster and a goose. \nChildren can climb on the back of a giant chicken and hold on to its reigns like the plantation worker in the 1963 painting. Kids also can load and unload cotton from the back of the cart into baskets. \nKids also can create their own imaginary animal with mix and match body parts wheels. \nIn Sargent's \"Camp at Lake O'Hara,\" children can see and smell the campfire as well as explore camping gear similar to what Sargent would have used. \nAn America artist acclaimed for his portraits Sargent loved the outdoors and in 1916 went to Lake O'Hara in Canada's Rocky Mountains where he painted a number of watercolor landscapes. \nIn the scene, kids can pull back the flaps of the tent and sit inside. They can learn about identifying different trees that would have been at the campsite. At another station, children can use magnetic pieces to arrange their own camp scene. \nIn \"Corn Festival\" by Diego Rivera, children can re-enact the painting in which peasants are weaving a corn stalk into a cross and decorating it with tulips and daisies. \nRivera was a Mexican artist known for his fresco murals of Mexican traditions. In the exhibit kids can attach magnetic flowers and \"corn husks\" to the re-creation of one of Rivera's frescos from the Court of Fiestas in the Ministry of Education Building in Mexico City. \nAnother station lets children explore the use of symmetry in art with a computer program called \"kaleidodraw\" in which they create kaleidoscope designs from lines, leaves, butterflies and even letters. \nMirroring the museum's adult exhibit exploring \"The Secrets of Mona Lisa,\"\"Framed: Step Into Art\" has a version of Leonardo Da Vinci's 15th century masterpiece with the face cut out so little ones can insert their own faces and see themselves as Mona Lisa in a mirror. \nThe exhibit also includes famous parodies of the iconic image, including Fernando Botero's \"fat figure\" Mona Lisa and \"Mona Moi,\" the Muppets' Miss Piggy recast as the subject of the painting. \nIn the most immersive display, families can sit down to \"eat\" with a younger version of Grant Wood in his 1934 painting \"Dinner For Threshers.\" \nWood, an American painter know for his images of the rural American Midwest, including the iconic \"American Gothic,\" painted an event he recalled from his youth on an Iowa farm as the sunburned farmers sat down to a hearty mid-day meal after toiling all morning in the fields. \nThe exhibit has denim overalls and checkered shirts for kids to try on and they can sit down at the table with the farmers. In the kitchen are pots and pans as well as dishes and \"food\" for children to take to the table to feed the hungry threshers. \nChildren also can mix and match the shirts of the farmers and tend to a chicken and eggs outside next to the barn. \nOther activities in the exhibit include an art scavenger hunt and a chalkboard for kids to create their own mural. \nKathy.lauer@mcall.com \n610-778-2235 \n• For families who missed the traveling \"Be the Dinosaur\" exhibit which was at Da Vinci Science Center in Allentown through April, it will be at the Reading Museum though Sept. 7.
