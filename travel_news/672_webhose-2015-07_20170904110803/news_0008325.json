Front desk in the lobby of The Ritz-Carlton, Shenzhen, in Shenzhen, China.

It has comfortable rooms, great food and beverage outlets, a lovely swimming pool, and a sumptuous spa. \nI take the subway to Futian Station. The Ritz-Carlton is at Exit D. I walk into the beautiful lobby and ask to speak to the General Manager. \nMy heart sinks when I am told that it's his day off. He is the only one the hotel that really knows me. \n\"I am the Duty Manager,\" I am told. \"Can I assist you?\" \nI take a deep breath and explain the situation. The Duty Manager checks the computer and finds my record. He calls the nearest police station and explains the situation. \nLobby Lounge \n\nThe lobby lounge at The Ritz-Carlson, Shenzhen, in Shenzhen, China.

He eventually asks me to have something to drink in the Lobby Lounge while he handles the rep tape. \n\"This will take awhile,\" he says. \"Just try to relax. And try to pretend you are on vacation.\" \nWhile I'm enjoying an iced lemon tea, the General Manager walks in. He recognizes me, walks over to my table, and warmly greets me. I ask if he'd like to join me. \n\"Sorry, I can't chat,\" he says. \"I'm on my way to an important meeting. How have you been?\" \nWhen I mention that my passport has be stolen, he sits down, and says, \"I'll give you 2 minutes. Tell me what happened and how we can help.\" \nI explain the situation. He says, \"Don't worry. I'll speak to the Duty Manager. Rest assured. Everything will be all right.\" \nExecutive Lounge \n\nExecutive Lounge of the Ritz-Carlson, Shenzhen, in Shenzhen, China.

I am booked into a room for 3 nights and will have access to the Executive Lounge. \nI have stayed at this hotel before, and I know that with access to the Executive Lounge I won't go hungry - or thirsty! \nThere are 5 \"food and beverage presentations\" per day, from a buffet breakfast in the morning to a yummy lunch buffet to afternoon tea to pre-dinner cocktails to evening cordials and chocolates before bed time. \nOf all of the 5 star hotels and resorts I have stayed at, the executive lounges at Ritz-Carlton hotels are among the most generous. \nThe Executive Lounge also has 2 computer terminals and - more importantly - staff that can offer me the logistical support I will need over the next couple of days. \nMost importantly, they will offer me the emotional support I need as I figure out my next move. \nTo Be Continued \nWhere \nThe Ritz-Carlton, Shenzhen, 116 Futian San Road, Futian District, Shenzhen, China.
