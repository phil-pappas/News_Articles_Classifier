The Shoot Like a Pro: Reloaded! tour provides photographers with an insight into how to take their skills to the next level showcasing concepts, ideas and techniques to create unique images. Future tour dates will be held in Washington, San Francisco and Philadelphia. \nThe one day seminar attracted 275 photographers who participated in a number of masterclasses on topics including Really Great Lighting on a Really Tight Budget, Photo Recipes: A Cookbook of Looks (and exactly how to create them) and Scott’s 7-Point System for Lightroom (or Camera Raw). Jeff Revel, who assisted with organisation of the event, commented: “We were delighted to bring the Shoot Like a Pro: Reloaded! tour to the UK and Church House was an ideal venue for the event. It was centrally located and provided us with all the facilities we needed to ensure our delegates got the most out of the day.” Robin Parker, General Manager of Church House Conference Centre, comments: “It was a great coup for Church House that we were chosen to host the only seminar on the tour to be held outside of America. We have seen a diversification away from the traditional conferences being held within our walls in the last 12 months and this is just an example of one of the many different type of events which are now choosing Church House. We were delighted to host such a fantastic event and hope all the delegates enjoyed learning from one of the world’s most well know Photoshop experts.” Church House Conference Centre is an AIM Gold accredited venue which offers 19 event spaces accommodating between 2 and 664 guests for a wide variety of events including meetings, conferences, awards ceremonies, gala dinners and receptions.
