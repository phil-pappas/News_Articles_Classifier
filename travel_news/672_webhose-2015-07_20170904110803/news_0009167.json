This year, the youngest, who possesses an understanding of their mechanics and physics far beyond his 10 years, wrote an essay on the low probability of rider injury so persuasive that even his risk-averse mother couldn't argue with it.\nFor two years, the boys had been on a quest to persuade us to take them to Cedar Point, the amusement park on Lake Erie known as \"The Roller Coaster Capital of the World.\" Why two years? Because you must be at least 54 inches tall to ride all 17 coasters. The youngest reached that height last winter.\nI viewed the trip with limited enthusiasm. My dislike of thrill rides and my husband's chronic bad back aside, our friend and neighbor, herself a mother of three sons, had been injured the week before in the tragic Amtrak train crash in Philadelphia. Taking such a trip when someone we cared for lay in the hospital facing an arduous recovery felt frivolous. But the suddenness and violence of the crash made savoring precious family time a priority. I just wished we could have done it somewhere else.\nAren't our lives enough like roller coasters? Each morning, our family awakes at dawn, straps in, and goes hurtling in five directions, each time counting on blind faith that we will reunite at day's end. When something derails, as it literally did for our friend, it is a jarring reminder of how fragile and fleeting life is. Why would we want to engage in an activity that harnesses that uncertainty?\n\"There it is!\" someone shouts.\nIn the distance they appear: arcs of shiny steel against blue sky. I am struck by their sheer mass, this indisputable evidence of man's ingenuity in the name of fun, but also surprisingly taken by their beauty, quiet and majestic as we approach, casting swirls of vivid color across the horizon.\nUpon entering the park, we approach the GateKeeper, the tallest, longest, and fastest \"wing coaster\" in the world. Up close, it is enormous. Stretched like blue and white taffy, it undulates alongside the lake around the park perimeter. The carts, which ride on either side of the tracks, toss riders like rag dolls. Arms and legs dangle as they flip and spiral, then are threaded through two gateposts like punted footballs, trailed by screams that must carry all the way to Canada.\nWhat kind of mother allows her children to ride such a contrivance alone? One too terrified to join them, I think with shame.\nBut they have gone, disappeared into a line growing longer by the minute. My husband and I nurse our Starbucks. Instantly, I long for simpler days when the boys were content to ride in a cart that was bolted to the ground.\nAfter a while, they run toward us, in one piece, waving their arms.\n\"That was AWESOME!\"\n\"We're going again!\"\n\"Dad, you're coming!\"\nWithout evidence of a second thought, regard for his well being, or consultation with his wife, my husband rises, dumps his sunglasses and hat in my lap, and joins them. I crack open the book I brought.\nAs we visit the various coasters, I notice how happy the riders look, from the moment they scramble to their seats in anticipation to their incredulous look of triumph when they return, wild-haired and ecstatic. Each time, they break into applause, as if they had a front-row seat to a fabulous show.\nMy safe spot on the bench, surrounded by others who've made my choice, seems boring. We shield our eyes from the sun and gaze up toward our loved ones, whose screams of delight drift down like confetti from a party in the sky we could attend, too - if only we had the courage.\n\"You can do this one, Mom. It's old. It's been around for years.\"\nIt's called Mean Streak and looks like it's held together by millions of giant toothpicks. While it's not as pretty as the others, I'm done missing out on the fun. Still, at 161 feet and 65 m.p.h., Mean Streak is one of the tallest, fastest, and longest wooden coasters in the world. I will feel like a badass if I ride it.\nI buckle my lap belt and lower the bar across my legs, checking more times than necessary that it's locked. We jolt forward.\nI hear the steady click-click-click as we ascend. A gentle wind blows, and a glorious sunset appears to my left. I think of our friend, how scared she must have felt when the train derailed, her deep frustration at this change in course of her life. I know she would give anything to be sharing this moment with her boys. In her honor, I ignore my fear.\nThe clicking stops, and I feel the mechanism release. I see no more tracks before us, only air. It is so quiet up here at the summit. My oldest son turns and says, \"We're going to die!\" (Boys.) I could close my eyes and miss this experience, but instead, I keep them open, terrified. Then, I scream so loud my voice breaks.\nThe boys' laughter surrounds me. Our knuckles whiten from gripping the bar as we endure a deep twist that throws us against each other, followed by several hills that lift us off our seats. We aren't just in the front row of an exhilarating show, we are starring in it, as we scream through another gravity-defying plummet, then laugh as we level out, having cheated imagined peril once again.\nWith a screech, those adrenaline-infused moments end too soon. I catch my breath and look to my boys, who high-five me as we applaud.\nThey are proud of me, and I am proud of myself. I can tell my husband is surprised to see me smiling. The crowd has thinned, the park lights flick on, and the coasters cast their soaring silhouettes against the evening sky. Tomorrow, we will return home, to the office and school, activities and chores. We hope to hear news of our friend's journey back to wellness, likely to include steep hills and unexpected twists before she arrives there.\nWe saunter past the Maverick, a licorice-red lasso of sturdy steel with a twisted horseshoe roll.\n\"Let's do this one as a family!\" my middle son says.\nThe boys run to the entrance. My nerves spike. My newborn confidence plummets. But why would I miss this chance to share a thrill with my family, a few precious minutes of exhilaration and joy, fears be damned?\n\"Wait!\" I call. Their heads turn in surprise.\n\"Should we go?\" I ask my husband.\nHe shrugs, raises his eyebrows. \"Why not?\"\nAnd we are off, catching up to our kids to ride this last one together.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T15:42:32.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
