PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 00:00, Thu, Jul 30, 2015 NC The Thames Clippers will bring tourists close to many of London's landmarks They will be used by river bus and cruise company MBNA Thames Clippers (thamesclippers.com) to bring tourists almost within touching distance of dozens of iconic London landmarks. Although uninterrupted cruises along the full length of the Thames are impossible because of medieval bridges outside London that are too low for modern river ships, there are several options for those who want to see some of the world’s most famous sights. MBNA Thames Clippers run a hop-on hop-off commuter service but also a sightseeing and leisure service from London Bridge pier and London Eye pier to Greenwich. Visitors can explore the UNESCO World Heritage site around the National Maritime Museum, Royal Observatory and Queen’s House. There’s also Greenwich Park with the Greenwich Meantime meridian line, and the Cutty Sark to see. Other Thames Clippers routes take you from the Tate Modern to Tate Britain, and in all you can sail from Putney in west London through the heart of the city all the way to Royal Arsenal Woolwich in the east.
