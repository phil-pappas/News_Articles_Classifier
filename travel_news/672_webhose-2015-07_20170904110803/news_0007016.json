Clark Eagle Ridge Resort near Galena a scenic, active destination Madeline J. Clark The Eagle Ridge Resort in Galena, Ill., includes a man-made lake that is only open to nonmotorized boats and boats with small engines. The lake is also great for fishing. By Brian E. Clark (0) Comments Brian E. Clark Horseback riders follow a trail at the Shenandoah Riding Center near the Eagle Ridge Resort in Galena, Ill. \nIn a scene that looked to me to be straight out of the Australian movie \"The Man from Snowy River,\" a herd of more than 50 horses raced down a slope in the hills above the Shenandoah Riding Center near Galena, Ill. on a recent evening. \nThe horses halted, spun around and sprinted up the slope again, only to circle back around to where they'd started. Then, as if the gallop switch had been flicked off, they stopped, spread out over the verdant meadow and began chewing at the lush, green grass at their feet. \nI thought about those racing horses as my kids and I went for a low-key (no galloping), hourlong ride the next morning near the center with wrangler and trail guide Cassie Harper. A few of the steeds were in pastures beside the trail we used and, being intensely social animals, they whinnied heartily as we moseyed by. \nWe'd arrived at our digs at the nearby Eagle Ridge Resort the night before and watched dusk settle over Galena Lake while we dined at the Woodlands Restaurant. I had delicious baked salmon that melted in my mouth while my wife and daughter had petite filet mignon cuts that they raved about. And for my 12-year-old son, French fries and chicken fingers. (Oh well.) \nAfter walking down to the 225-acre, man-made lake to watched pontoon boats putter around and canoeists paddle smoothly over the calm waters, we drove to the riding center for a rodeo that featured fearless cowboys who rode broncs, roped and wrestled steers and tried to stay on angry bulls, as well as cowgirls who raced around barrels on their mounts. \nA few of the cowpokes were still at the center the next morning, preparing for another rodeo that night. Harper, who grew up in Florida on her parents' peanut and cotton farm, said she picked a college in Missouri because it had a women's rodeo team. Though the horses were a mellow group and used to greenhorn trail rides, Harper had to calm them down after birds flew out of a tree and made several of the horses jump, giving their riders a start. \nOne of the best parts of our stop at the Shenandoah Center came after the ride when my kids got to pet Midnight, a huge Brahma bull (the kind with a big hump on its shoulders) in a paddock. Midnight, we were told, thinks he's a horse and even gives rides. He also loves to have his ebony coat scratched, we discovered. \nBut there's a lot more to do during a visit to Eagle Ridge Resort than just go horseback riding. The resort offers sunrise and sunset hot air balloon rides, miles of bicycling and hiking trails, fishing, the Stonedrift Spa (where my wife indulged in a Swedish massage during our trail ride) and four golf courses. \nThe town of Galena, which is on the National Register of Historic Places and was once home to former President Ulysses S. Grant, is only seven miles to the west and well worth checking out. Incredibly, it's the second most popular tourist site in Illinois after Chicago. Clearly, there is plenty to keep visitors occupied in the area for a long weekend and more. \nColin Sanderson, a spokesman for the 800-acre resort, said Eagle Ridge is now in its 36th year. While most of its patrons come from the greater Chicago area, it also draws guests from all over the Midwest. The luxury resort lodge has 80 rooms, but visitors can rent 200 homes on the property, some of which Sanderson described as \"mini-mansions\" featuring six or more bedrooms with board rooms and entertainment centers. \nEagle Ridge is a major draw for golfers, most of whom come to play the three championship courses. They are the General, which Sanderson said is rated among the country's top 100 courses; the North Course; and the South Course. He said the East Course has nine holes, and has options for those who like big cups. It offers \"foot golf,\" played with a regulation soccer ball and \"hack golf,\" which has 15-inch cups on the greens for considerably easier putting. \n\"We haven't found a better name than 'hack' golf,\" he said, apologizing. \"But with a much bigger hole, people who aren't very good or who haven't played much can have more fun. But the great thing about that course is that the whole family can play at the same time in different ways and the speed is increased a lot.\" \nSanderson said one of the resort's little-known secrets is the excellent fishing in the lake, where I saw an angler land what looked to be a large bass one morning. \n\"People don't realize how good it is, one of the best spots in the Midwest,\" he said. \"There are 50 to 60 different varieties of fish in the lake, so there's a lot to catch.\" \nSanderson said the only motors allowed on the water are small engines that power the slow-moving pontoon boats because the lake is relatively small and to keep the noise level down for guests. All the watercraft, except for the pontoon boats, are free of charge for guests. \nTennis players can bring their rackets and play on four courts at the resort. For families with young children, there is a playground. When we were there, several inflatables had been set up for youngsters to play on. And if parents want some free time, the resort offers Camp Eagle for kids ages 4 to 12. \nBecause the resort is in the Driftless Area, which was not flattened by ice during the last glacial period, the resort is set on a series of hill, valleys and ridges, many of them covered by deciduous trees that change color in the fall. \n\"It looks like the hillsides are on fire then,\" said Sanderson. \"And come winter, we offer cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, sledding, sleigh rides and other seasonal activities, too. But you don't have to do anything here if you don't want. This is also a great place to simply relax and unwind.\" \nMore information: The Shenandoah Riding Center is at 200 N. Brodrecht Road, Galena. Trail rides are $45 for an hour and $75 for 90 minutes.
