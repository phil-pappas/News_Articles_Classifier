If the trend holds, traffic will be backed up at entrance stations and parking lots will fill up fast.\nJuly typically is one of the busiest months of the year at the Grand Canyon, with some 622,000 visitors last July. About 4.5 million people visit the canyon annually.\nTo cut down on vehicle traffic inside the park, Grand Canyon officials are urging South Rim visitors to use the shuttle service from Tusayan (TU'-say-ohn). Visitors then can use shuttle buses. However, those will be crowded too and require a wait.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T11:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T18:36:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
