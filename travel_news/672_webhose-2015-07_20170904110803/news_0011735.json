Chale gaye sab saara saaman nikalke (The shop folded up today after 225 years. All the men have left with the items),” said a bangle-seller who sits in the lane next to Ghantewala, known across Delhi and outside for its pure desi ghee sweets. # 2 Since Childhood I found this shop in very shabby and decaying state. What ever hype they had created about being serving to emperors was loud talk only, hardly saw any customers there. In contrast many other Halwais in vicinity remain busy. Do not think owners ever bothered to have customarily white wash on Diwali for decades. I many times wanted to try some thing from them but shelfs used to be empty. Odd Jaleba or Sohan halwa could be visible, but not much to take home. Btw which Emperors they used to talk about, or all customers are king something like that.
