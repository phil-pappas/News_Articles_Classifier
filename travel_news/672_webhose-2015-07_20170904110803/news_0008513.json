Only those can participate who are allowed to do it under the changed Sebi norms which have been introduced since 2012-13 through FPI regulations,” said the official.\nAlso read: SIT asks Sebi to clamp down on tax evaders, P-Note misuse\nThe norms now have made it mandatory for the FPIs to provide the names of the participants and also transfers to Sebi at the end of every month, and with all the details available in the market regulator’s system, any investigation can be initiated immediately, if required.\nThe official pointed out that because of the restrictions, out of over 2,000 FPIs registered with Sebi, only 40-50 are issuing PNs at present. The current norms have been formulated after Ketan Parekh scam when there was unrestricted entry of PNs in the Indian market.\nBut, disclosing all the details to the investigating agencies without suggesting manipulative or illegal activity, will be dicey.\n“The SIT wants Sebi to disclose all details, but we can’t do that,” said the official.\nIt is a fact that the investors opting for the PN route do so because they don’t want to face any regulatory hassles. The moment they are subjected to I-T department’s scrutiny, they will, in all likelihood, start avoiding India.\nThough the possibilities of entry of black money through the PN route can’t be completely ruled out, this window needs to be handled carefully as any attempt that is seen as government targeting everyone unnecessarily will result in adverse reaction from the investors which includes hedge funds and high net worth (HNI) individuals.\nThis has happened in the past and the government needs to tread cautiously here.\nTake our opinion poll:\nTake Our Poll 27, 2015 9:01 am © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": ["http://polldaddy.com/poll/8998278"], "published": "2015-07-27T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T08:18:18.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
