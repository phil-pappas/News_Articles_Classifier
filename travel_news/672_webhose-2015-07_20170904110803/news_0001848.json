Sign In Here The next projects at General Mitchell International Airport will be less visible and disruptive to passengers, who navigated through rerouted traffic during a $45 million full-scale baggage claim renovation. “Now we move to the airfield kind of things,” said Brian Dranzik , the interim airport director. “We will be looking at safety improvements that can be made or need to be made, operations improvements.” The list includes concrete replacement on the runways, modifications to taxiways and installation of new de-icer pads. All are far less prominent to regular passengers, but likely no less important. More big-ticket concourse type projects will be formulated during discussions with the airlines, primarily the six major carriers that have signed on to a master lease agreement that will take effect Jan. 1, 2016. “We’re letting the dust settle a little bit on what’s going on with the airlines and the consolidation,” said Dranzik, who stepped in when Terry Slaybaugh left after three months as executive director. “Our major projects go through a process where they are ultimately approved by the airlines. We want to make sure they are comfortable and settled in where they’re going to be at the airport.” The airlines pay about $35 million a year, combined, for their use of gates, fuel, fuel systems, jet bridges, ticket counters and baggage areas. That makes up nearly 40 percent of the annual operating budget of $89.5 million. Parking fees produce about $29 million in revenue and concessions deliver about $15 million each year. Passenger facility charges, $4.50 per air ticket, provide about $13.2 million directed to capital projects. The current leases with the major carriers — Southwest Airlines, Delta, US Airways, United Airlines, Frontier and Air Canada — expire at the end of year and will be replaced by the new agreements. “We don’t expect any big moves,” Dranzik said. “We’re trending well in terms of where air service is going.” Airport officials have touted the additions of Alaska Airlines and OneJet as providers flying out of Mitchell. OneJet is a regional carrier operating flights daily to Pittsburgh and Indianapolis, and Alaska provides daily, nonstop service to Seattle, via SkyWest Airlines. Dranzik likes the prospects for additional service from Alaska. “I think we’re in a good place because we’re on their radar now and what we’ve seen from them is a positive response with bookings,” he said. “I think they’re pleased with where things are and we want to keep that going.” Running concessions Near the end of 2015, the airport will issue requests for vendors to submit proposals to operate non-food concessions in the airport. Paradies, based in Atlanta, currently holds the contract to operate newsstands and merchandise businesses within the airport. The vendor pays a percentage of its sales to the airport. Dranzik said the airport marketing team plans to update its promotional work to attract more travelers from northern Illinois, a large and fruitful market for Mitchell. Random telephone surveys in Lake, McHenry, Boone and Winnebago counties found about 90 percent of residents knew of or heard of Mitchell International in 2008. The percentage has increased to 97 percent, Dranzik said. The percentage of residents in those Illinois counties who have flown out of Mitchell International has increased from 18 percent to 35 percent, he said. “That puts some numbers behind what has been stated in the past,” he said. \nWant Milwaukee Travel news in your inbox?
