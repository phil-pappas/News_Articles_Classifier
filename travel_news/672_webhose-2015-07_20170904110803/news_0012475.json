There are many great tips in this article to help both rookie travelers and those who have experience. \nMake sure you are careful about any food allergies you may have whenever you visit a foreign land. If you suffer from severe food allergies, make sure you are able to speak those food related terms in the native language of your travel destination. This way you can be sure to alert wait staff of your allergies to specific foods and, in the worst case scenario, be able to inform medical professionals of your condition. \nWhen traveling on an airplane, don’t rely on the airline for any of your comfort needs, even if it’s an international flight. And items you may need, such as a pillow or blanket, should be packed before your flight. If you are concerned about not getting anything to eat on the flight, bring along your own snacks also. \nChoosing a seat on the aisle will open more options for you. A window seat has a view, but a seat at the aisle allows you more freedom in accessing your overhead bags, restrooms, getting attention of the service staff, and free space on one side of you. \nIf you worry about security, pack things like a doorstop to secure your door or other small things to ensure your safety. These handy little gadgets made of wood or rubber are usually intended to hold a door open, however they can also hold them closed. \nHotel etiquette calls for tipping the bellhop and housekeeping staff. For these services, a good tip for housekeeping would be from $2-$5 per day, and $1 per bag of luggage. This will keep your relationship with the employees a cordial one and your stay pleasant. \nTravel can be used as a way of educating your family. By taking time and preparing, there is nothing to fear from the developing world. It is a great way to show other cultures to children. This is a wonderful way to create an understanding of the rest of the world and to build tolerance of others. \nShare your travel itinerary with a family member or a trusted friend. This will let them know your whereabouts at all times. Ensure your safety by regularly contacting someone back at home. Hearing from you occasionally and knowing your whereabouts eases their minds. \nA motorcycle can provide great transportation for day trips, but only if the driver has a motorcycle license. The quick movements, efficient gas use and overall enjoyment will give the trip a great start. Motorcycle traveling can be lots of fun. \nWhen reserving a hotel room, ask if they’ll be doing renovations. This can cause a lot of disturbance to you. Just don’t book during those times. \nWhen packing for your next trip, it is important to take along a light raincoat. You never know that the weather will be like. A great example of making the most of what you have is using a raincoat for cold weather, any rain that arises and even possibly as a bathrobe! \nTravel is an excellent way to educate your family members on the ways of the world. As long as you are careful, you should feel confident about visiting developing nations, as they can offer extremely enlightening experiences for your children and you. Traveling to other countries is a good way to better understand them and the world as a whole. \nIf traveling with children, bring a cookie sheet. These are great for providing the flat surfaces needed for coloring or playing games. For little ones, try bringing   educational enjoyment. \nAlways check expiration dates on of all of your passports. Most countries have passport regulations with which you must comply. A country may decide to not let you enter if your passport is expiring within a certain amount of time. These times can be three or six months, or even eight months to a year. \nIf you are visiting a country in a different time zone, you may experience fatigue. You can’t completely avoid jet lag, but extra sleep on the days before you travel can minimize the effects. In addition, do your best to get some sleep during the flight. \nWhen making hotel reservations, ask if there are any impending renovations. Nothing ruins a vacation faster than being woken up with the noise of loud construction equipment. If you find out that a renovation is upcoming, either change the dates of your stay or go somewhere else. \nIf you usually forget things in the hotel room when traveling, try to write some reminders down on a mirror using a dry-erase marker. A paper note can easily get lost, but a note written on a mirror is hard to ignore. Dry-erase markers can easily be removed from the mirror. \nWell, hopefully this collection of tips were enough to give you a great start on what to do when it comes to taking and planing trips.
