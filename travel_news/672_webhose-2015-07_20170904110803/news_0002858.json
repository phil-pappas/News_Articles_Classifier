The scenic beauty of the Palani hill station is very tranquil. \n\nPalani’s main claim to fame is the Murugan Temple. This temple is one of the adobes of the Lord Murugan. The mythological tale as it that once Narada offered a divine fruit to Lord Shiva and his wife Parvathy, they wanted to give this fruit to their sons, Ganesha and Murugan. But Narada told this fruit should not be cut into pieces, so, Parvathy declared a competition and told that whoever among them will take a round of whole world and reach first to Shiva and Parvathy, he will win the fruit. Murugan immediately climbed on his peacock and started his world tour. But, Ganesha realised it was not an easy task for him; he very cleverly took a circle around his parents. He said that as they are the creators of the world, by circled them he had circled the whole world. Thus, he was gifted the divine fruit. When Murugan returned and found, this saddened him and left Kailasa and moved to the South. Parvathy tried to console him, telling him “Pazham Nee” meaning you are the fruit itself. That is how Palani was named. A good crowd of people visit Palani every year. And so, the place is well decorated with all the necessary accommodations. There are no luxury hotels in Palani yet, but the deluxe cottages are good, during the festival you have to book the rooms earlier. \n\nThe temple is situated at a height of 1,068 feet and the devotees have to climb more than 600 steps to reach the main temple. It is believed that devotees should start climbing after taking bath at Shanmukhanadi at the bottom of the hill. Ropeway is also there and during peak season it cost Rs 50.
