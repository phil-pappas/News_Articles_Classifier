They realised it would not be possible for us to accept their ultimatum. We have waited three months and then they give us just four hours to accept. This is not serious negotiation.” \nLondon Underground's chief operating officer Steve Griffiths said: \"Our customers are advised to check the TFL website for the latest information as we seek to resolve the dispute and to keep London moving should the unions go ahead with their action. \n\"We are available for talks at Acas all day.\" \nHe added: \"Londoners and businesses overwhelmingly back the night Tube. It will make life better for everyone, cut journey times, create jobs and boost the economy. Many of our staff will not be affected by the new services as we are operating Friday and Saturday night services on five lines.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T15:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T17:13:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
