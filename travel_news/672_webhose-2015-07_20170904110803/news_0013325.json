Produced by Catherine Stubbs. News Corp Australia 03 Jun 2015 \nBURIED within every corner and crevice in Central Park lies a hidden code that not even many seasoned New Yorkers know about. \nAnd it’s no surprise, they’re not easy to spot. But once you do, they’re everywhere. And its all because of the park’s sheer size. \nFor decades the city of New York has made efforts to mark the lamp posts within Central Park with embossed, numbered metal plaques. \nThe lamp posts contain a series of numbers that to the uneducated eye might look like a serial number. But the truth is far more interesting. \nThey are in fact a map to help lost souls navigate throughout the park, which spans a whopping 843 acres along 51 blocks. For Central Park’s 45 million annual tourists, this is New York City’s urban jungle — and without the help of Google Maps, it’s easy to lose your way. \nThe code has changed over the years and different variations are seen on different lampposts, depending on its age (the first were erected in 1907). \nThe first two numbers indicate the closest cross-street in your vicinity. \nThe second two indicate the lamp post number within that block. \nNewer versions usually include a “W” to indicate you’re on the West side of Manhattan, or an “E” to indicate you’re on the East side. “C” means you’re in the Centre of the park. \nThe numbers were originally painted on the lampposts, some have sat there for decades, others have clearly been replaced with newer versions. \nIt’s easy to ignore in this modern age of technology and instant answers, but when you’re battery has run out of your phone, this might just be the lifesaver you need. An older variation: You’re on 60th Street. Picture: Matt Young Source: Supplied You’re on 61st Street.
