So, as the summer holidays approach, Guardian Travel has teamed up with the organisation for a fantastic reader offer. We are giving one family the chance to win not just one stay, but an entire year’s worth of holidays at selected YHA properties in England and Wales. The lucky winner (plus four guests) will be entitled to a total of 200 overnights in a private room at their choice of the organisation’s 160 hostels, including campsites. To enter, simply email your name, contact telephone number and email address to yhaprizedraw@theguardian.com. A winner will be chosen at random.\nThe first youth hostel in Britain opened at Pennant Hall, near Llanrwst, north Wales, in December 1930. It was closed the following year, but in 1931 another 75 hostels opened, two of which are still in use today: YHA Idwal Cottage, Snowdonia , and YHA Street, Somerset . In those early days, motorists weren’t welcome, alcohol was banned, dorms were single sex and strict curfews were imposed. Things could hardly be more different now. In place of the damp, wet-sock-smelling hostels of old are an array of comfortable, friendly hostels with en suite private rooms, bars, restaurants, glampsites and even honeymoon suites . And the organisation continues to grow. In the last five years, six new hostels have opened – Brighton, Castleton (Derbyshire), Cardiff, South Downs, Berwick and Eden, where guests stay in former shipping containers – and existing hostels have been overhauled, most recently YHA Boggle Hole in Robin Hood’s Bay , which reopened in June. \nTerms and Conditions – YHA Prize Draw 2015 \n1. The YHA Holiday for a Year prize draw (the “Prize Draw”) is open to residents of the UK aged 18 and over. \n2.
