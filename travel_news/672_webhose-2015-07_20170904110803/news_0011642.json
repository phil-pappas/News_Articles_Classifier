Until now.\nAustralia’s obsession with burgers has reached new heights, with a popular Sydney bar now serving a Spam burger.\nBloody Mary’s in Sydney’s Darlinghurst is known for its Instagram-worthy, American diner-style creations and of course, top-notch Bloody Marys made with homemade tomato juice.\nThe spam burger costs $16 and comes with grilled spam, bacon, lettuce, tomato, pineapple, mayonnaise and mustard.\n“We put it on the menu two weeks ago and it’s going off, it’s crazy,” owner Cinta Rockey told news.com.au .\nThe spam burger in all its glory.

Source: Supplied\n“Last week there were 12 people who ordered it and now that number has doubled.”\nMs Rockey says it tastes “just like a normal hamburger”.\n“People are a little bit freaked out about eating meat out of a can, but so far it’s getting a positive response. I guess don’t knock it till you try it. I love it. I’m not going to say anything bad about it. We wanted to think outside the box and bring spam back into fashion,” she said.\nWhile the spam burger certainly isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, it’s got some burger lovers super excited.\n“I’m drooling all over myself,” one user commented on a photo of the spam burger on Bloody Marys’ Instagram account. “We dig this. good stuff,” wrote another. And there was this gem from the ultimate spam fan — “spam-tastic!!!”\nFollow @bloodymaryssydney on Instagram.\nOriginally published as Spam burgers on the menu for $16 a pop", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/food/spam-burger-on-the-menu-at-bloody-marys-in-sydney/story-fn93ypt9-1227425535055", "https://instagram.com/bloodymaryssydney/", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/02/1227425/544407-28d6e128-1fa5-11e5-9bcb-f95a534f046c.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-02T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T12:31:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
