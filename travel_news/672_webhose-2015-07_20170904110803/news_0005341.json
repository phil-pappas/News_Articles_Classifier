Mount Raung, on Java, has been spewing ash into the air for more than a week, affecting visibility. \nBali's international airport, as well as two airports on Lombok and two on Java, closed last week, but all except one on Java have now reopened. However, the backlog of flights means delays and cancellations are still possible. Virgin Australia, meanwhile, are still refusing to fly to and from Bali. \nHere’s what to do if your flight or holiday is affected. Am I entitled to a refund if my airline cancels my flight? \nYes. EU regulations – which apply to anyone flying to or from an EU, Swiss, Norwegian or Icelandic airport, and with an EU, Swiss, Norwegian or Icelandic airline - require airlines to offer you either a full refund of the unused parts of your tickets, or to re-route you to your destination, as soon as possible. If your flight is cancelled outright you are entitled to a full refund. Some airlines may also allow you to rebook your flights for a later date at no extra cost. \nIf you are travelling with a non-EU airline, between two non-EU airports, then you are bound by the terms of your contract. The CAA says: “Most airlines base their terms and conditions on those recommended by the International Air Transport Association. This means that when delays happen, most airlines have a contractual obligation to offer passengers a choice between a later flight, mutually agreed alternative transportation or a refund.” Will I get compensation for any delay? \nNo. EU regulations mean passengers are entitled to cash compensation when their flight is delayed for three hours or more, unless the delay is beyond their control. Clearly a volcanic eruption fits this description. What should I do if I’m stranded abroad? \nEU regulations make it clear that, when a flight with an EU airline or from an EU airport is cancelled, an airline is liable to pay for the cost of a hotel and subsistence for all those stranded as a result, until a replacement flight is provided. Should your airline advise you to buy your own food and accommodation, keep all receipts, and keep such costs to a reasonable minimum, before making a claim when you get back to Britain. \nThose passengers on package holidays who are stranded in a destination should be looked after by their tour operator Photo: AFP \nFor non-EU airlines, the CAA says: “Some may provide refreshments and accommodation for passengers while they wait for their delayed flight. Some airlines will not. If they do not, you can try to claim for reimbursement of your expenses due to the delay. You have the right to claim for this under the Montreal Convention. Be aware that you may struggle to be reimbursed for anything other than meals or overnight hotel accommodation, so spend wisely. Keep receipts.” What about package holidays? \nThose passengers on package holidays who are stranded in a destination should be looked after by their tour operator, and the operator is legally obliged to get them home. Customers will usually be allowed to stay in their original hotel, or will be moved to one of a similar standard on a half-board or all-inclusive basis. The exact situation will depend on the operator’s booking terms and conditions. \nThose due to travel will be entitled to a full refund if their holiday is cancelled. \nThose due to travel will be entitled to a full refund if their holiday is cancelled Photo: AFP Can I cancel my accommodation? \nIf you have booked a hotel, a villa or other accommodation independently of your travel arrangements (ie not as part of a package holiday) your contract is directly with the hotel or villa and you are responsible for any cancellation. If you can’t get there, you will have to do your best to persuade them to give you a refund or rebook for a later date – but they are not obliged to do this and you may lose money. What about other arrangements I have paid for? \nIf you have booked a hire car, a hotel, a villa or other accommodation independently of your flight, and you are delayed or unable to travel, the airline is not liable for any losses you may incur. You are still responsible for paying the bill. Am I covered by my travel insurance? \nYour policy may pay out a small amount for very long delays (usually over 12 hours), but not usually enough to pay for more than a meal or two. A few policies have cover for a “consequential loss”, such as a hotel booking made independently. You will need to check the terms and conditions which apply to your policy directly with your insurer.
