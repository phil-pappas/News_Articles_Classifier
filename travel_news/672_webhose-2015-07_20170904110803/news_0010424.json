Visitors to Oahu can explore Hawaii’s special culture and iconic history, or choose from a wide variety of outdoor and indoor activities that are sure to energize the spirit. Let’s see what’s new for the summer and early fall of 2015. \nBishop Museum The Bishop Museum honors the legacy of Hawaii Olympic swimming champion and ambassador of aloha, Duke Paoa Kahanamoku , with a special exhibit, running August 8 – November 2 , 2015 in the J. M. Long Gallery. Visitors can feel the rush of Duke’s legendary mile-long surfboard ride at Waikiki in 1917 via a virtual reality 3D experience, or compete to break his 1920 Olympic men’s 100-meter freestyle swimming record with a tabletop upper-body pedal exerciser. BishopMuseum.org \nAlso the museum’s popular Dinosaurs Unleashed exhibit has gained a new character. Now through September 6, 2015 on Saturdays and Sundays at 10:30 a.m., Bishop Museum’s Face-to-Face Encounter will allow visitors to get up close with Nalala the gorgosaurus to learn about dinosaur biology, anatomy, movement and behavior. The dinosaur is actually a 15-foot long, full body costume that the museum’s trained staff bring to life. With complex internal mechanics and audio effects, the costume is extremely realistic, giving visitors a very convincing experience of a close-up dinosaur encounter. You can learn more about dinosaurs with About.com’s Dinosaurs expert Bob Strauss . \nCLIMB Works Keana Farms CLIMB Works Keana Farms , located on Oahu’s North Shore, added their final and longest zip line of over 2,500 feet this June. With this new addition, the full tour now consists of eight dual ziplines, an ATV adventure to the ridge top, four sky bridges and boardwalks, two rappels and a rope climb. This guided tour takes participants soaring over a working agricultural farm nestled in between the North Shore's famous beaches and lush mountains. \nEast-West Center Gallery The East-West Center Gallery presents A Common Thread: Textiles from the East-West Center’s Permanent Collection , now through Sept. 20, 2015.
