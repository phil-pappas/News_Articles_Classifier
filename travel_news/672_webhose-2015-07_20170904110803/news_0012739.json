Like many who love this region, I am still captivated by its vast beaches, big skies and atmospheric marshland. I never fail to be amazed at how easy it is to shake off the crowds and find a completely deserted stretch of sand, even at the height of summer and at the most popular destinations such as Holkham, Brancaster or Wells-Next-the-Sea. \nI also love Norfolk’s inland beauty: its quiet lanes, flint-built villages, unspoilt rural countryside and the large deer parks of its grand estates. The perfect day \nThis would have to include a trip to a beach, so I’d pack a picnic, park at Wells-Next-the-Sea beach and walk through the pine woods and brightly coloured beach huts to the sea. Then I’d head west towards Holkham and walk as far as time allowed to find a place for lunch and a snooze in the dunes. \nOr I’d go for lunch at the Creake Abbey Cafe & Food Hall (01328 730399; creakeabbeycafe.com ) in the grounds of the 13th-century Augustinian ruins near North Creake, where an acclaimed local chef, Alison Yetman, is head chef. \nIn the afternoon, I’d soak up some stately grandeur at 18th-century Holkham Hall (01328 710227; holkham.co.uk ) with its marble hall and statue gallery, before buying local produce for dinner. \nThe region is rich in specialist food shops, so I might head to Walsingham Farm Shop (01328 821877; walsinghamfarmsshop.co.uk ), The Fish Shed in Brancaster (01485 210532: fishshed.co.uk ) or Back to the Garden (01263 715996; back-to-the-garden.co.uk ) for Cromer crab, Brancaster oysters or a selection of Mrs Temple’s cheeses. Where I tell my friends to stay \nIt’s hard to pick from the many excellent places to stay locally, but if the friends are urban types who want a lively atmosphere, I’d suggest The Hoste in Burnham Market (01328 738777; thehoste.com ), a 17th-century inn turned stylish boutique hotel in this fashionable Georgian town. For a special treat, I’d suggest staying in the Vine House annexe, a short walk from the inn, or for smaller, good-value rooms, there’s the Hoste’s Railway House at £135 for a double room with continental breakfast. \nFor sea views, I’d point my friends towards The White Horse in Brancaster (01485 210262; whitehorsebrancaster.co.uk ), one of the few hotels with direct access onto the coastal path and marshes, and close to large sandy beaches, with double rooms and breakfast from £100. If they were in need of some pampering, the newly opened Congham Hall (01485 600250; conghamhallhotel.co.uk ) in 30 acres of parkland near King’s Lynn, would be my recommendation. Double rooms start at a reasonable £120 for bed only midweek, and prices include use of the gorgeous Secret Garden Spa with swimming pool. Favourite walk \nThe undemanding, hour-long walk along the sea wall between Morston and Blakeney is the perfect stroll on a sunny afternoon. \nBlakeney, at the end of a perfect stroll \nFrom the raised path, you get sweeping views of marshes, muddy creeks, moored boats and numerous seabirds including terns, gulls, oystercatchers and lapwings. You also get great views across the broad harbour to the National Nature Reserve of Blakeney Point, with its distinctive blue visitor centre, formerly a lifeboat station. Park in the National Trust car park on Morston Quay (signed from the A149) and head eastwards. The Moorings on Blakeney’s High Street (01263 740054; blakeney-moorings.co.uk ) is a cosy place to stop for tea before retracing your steps to Morston. Favourite restaurants \nThe Gunton Arms in Thorpe Market, near Cromer (01263 832010; theguntonarms.co.uk ), is one of the newest estblishments in the region, with a restaurant that’s as popular with locals as hotel residents (there are eight comfortable and striking rooms here). The chef, Stuart Tattersall, specialises in succulent steaks cooked on an open fire; guests sit refectory-style at long, wooden tables. Main courses from £10.50. For a more expensive treat, I’d book a table at Morston Hall (01263 741041; morstonhall.com ), where the Michelin-starred chef Galton Blackiston serves a no-choice, four-course menu at a single sitting (7.30pm for 8pm) costing £66 per person. Dishes are beautifully presented and based on local ingredients. Take my advice and… \nCheck out the Coast Hopper ( coasthopper.co.uk ), a handy bus service that runs along the coast road between King’s Lynn and Cromer. It’s perfect for walkers who want to complete a section of the Norfolk Coast Path National Trail without backtracking. See the website for suggested itineraries and timings. Dogs are welcome on board. Favourite tea shop \nIn a setting that feels almost Mediterranean (shady pine trees and sandy soil underfoot), the Wiveton Cafe (01263 740515; wivetonhall.co.uk/the-cafe ) is good for lunch or tea. In summer, you can pick your own raspberries or strawberries from the surrounding fields. Favourite pub \nMy choice is the snug, old-fashioned Lord Nelson in Burnham Thorpe (01328 738241; nelsonslocal.co.uk ). Unusually, it has no bar – drinks and food are served at tables – and its large, enclosed garden is ideal for children. Favourite family pastime \n“Gillying”– catching the spiny crabs that lurk under the sand in the shallow water along the coast. This keeps young children happy for hours, and all you need is a weighted line (no hooks) baited with raw meat (bacon works well) and a bucket of seawater to put the crabs into before gently releasing them at the end of your session. Head to the quaysides at Blakeney or Wells-Next-the-Sea, or try the shallow creeks at Morston. Perfect night out \nCromer’s Seaside Special show is one of the last surviving “end-of-the-pier” shows in Britain. It attracts a loyal and enthusiastic following who love the successful blend of comedy, dance, magic and singing. Performances run throughout the summer (01263 512495; cromer-pier.co .uk ). \nThe Cromer seafront What I’ll be doing this year \nBooking tickets for Jeff Koons at Norwich Castle Museum (01603 493625; museums.norfolk.gov.uk ), a new exhibition of ground-breaking work by the American artist, Jeff Koons - one of the most controversial artists of our time. This is the first time his work has been shown in East Anglia, and the only chance to see it in the UK in 2015. It runs until September 6 and admission costs £6 Books for inspiration \nBuilding Norfolk by Matthew Rice (£25, Frances Lincoln) explores the region’s distinctive architecture and has more than 300 watercolour illustrations. The Go-Between by LP Hartley is set (and the film was shot) in Norfolk. \nTelegraph Travel's guide to Norfolk and Suffolk , by Sophie Butler", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T16:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T18:27:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
