But despite overwhelming support and the widespread view that the AIIB is much-needed if significant growth is to take place across the entire Asia-Pacific region, this news has been met with a far from celebratory mood. I suspect strongly that there are two main reasons for this. One, the United States-led, pernicious propaganda campaign against the AIIB’s inception, and two, a lack of understanding of the AIIB and the role of China and its international emergence. China’s plans for major economic development have nothing to do with power and dominance, and everything to do with peaceful co-operation in Asia Historians and many other people around the world all agree that Chinese history persistently paints a picture of the Chinese as characterised by peace, co-operation and protection. It is abundantly clear, therefore, that the AIIB initiative and China’s plans for major economic development for western China and the Asia-Pacific have nothing to do with power and dominance, and everything to do with peaceful co-operation across Asia. Why have so many European nations rushed to become founding AIIB members? No Asian country is better placed than China to lead economic integration Simply because they appreciate the conciliatory nature of this initiative coupled with the firm belief that China is working in the interests of the region. Of course, regional development, wherever this may be, takes place much more effectively with a leader, as has been the case with Europe and Germany. Critics of the AIIB sadly and mistakenly interpret China’s leading role in Asia-Pacific economic integration as a United States-like need for absolute power and dominance. Instead, the opposite is true, and it is not just Chinese altruism that needs to be appreciated, it is also the encyclopedic knowledge and experience China has gained as a result of their economic miracle. China has also demonstrated deep understanding of the economic development needs and imperatives across Asia, with infrastructure the essential building block, and financial and political engagement needed across the entire region. Any United States-style arrogance and aggression is simply not the Chinese way No Asian country is better placed than China to lead economic integration, and with this, significant and rapid development. But Europe and the West must understand this is a leadership defined by inclusivity, not exclusivity. China will serve and support the entire Asia-Pacific region. Any United States-style arrogance and aggression is simply not the Chinese way. One cynical view that also runs counter to just about every act of international engagement carried out by the Chinese is that China has the largest percentage of voting rights and will exercise a veto on policy proposals. Once again, only a superficial glance at Chinese history leads to the unequivocal conclusion that a veto is completely anathema to the Chinese style of negotiating. China’s economic emergence has benefited Western brands enormously With the injection of almost $30 billion (£19 billion) of the authorised $100 billion capital, China has every right to have a major say in policy formation and implementation, but widespread agreement and compromise will dominate the day-to-day AIIB operation and modus operandi. Another cynical and wildly inaccurate rumour is that the AIIB is part of some push by the Chinese government to help Chinese companies expand internationally. In response to this, it is important to note the increasing international success of Chinese brands. But even more apposite is the fact that China’s economic emergence, and that of the surrounding region, has benefited Western brands enormously. The Chinese government has not only welcomed this, but continues to attract foreign investment across all parts of the Chinese mainland. Central to the USA's rant has been the suggestion that other organisations already fulfil such a role Moving on to the United States-led propaganda war against the AIIB, which has been running for at least two years, we also find untruth after untruth, and specious after specious argument. Central to the United States’ raucous rant has been the suggestion that other organisations already fulfil such a role, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The United States appears to persist with this line in spite of the fact that fierce criticism of the World Bank has been descending on the acerbic Americans for more than 10 years, and despite the fact that the AIIB has both an infrastructure and regional focus, unlike the amorphous United States-led World Bank. So, not only is there little or no overlap, it is also clear to many that a root-and-branch review of the World Bank’s operation is long overdue. Even World Bank former presidents contribute to the widespread view that it is just not working That the US-dominated World Bank has received pernicious and persistent criticism over many years might explain partly the overwhelming support by the Europeans for the AIIB. Even former presidents of the World Bank, as well as former senior members of staff, have contributed to the widespread view that this bank is just not working. Much of this considerable criticism centres on the apparent servitude shown to the United States government and its worrisome foreign policy. The World Bank’s credibility will continue to be questioned with the continuation of this state of servitude, where American foreign policy drives much of this bank’s activity. First and foremost, the AIIB is about long-term development with persistent pumping of investment into the poorest Asian economies The United States also claims the AIIB will diminish the role of the IMF. Once again, this argument flies directly in the face of the facts. First and foremost, the AIIB is about long-term development with persistent pumping of investment into the poorest Asian economies. The AIIB has been set up to support sustainable economic growth across the region, too, and is unlikely to focus investment on one country. Instead, critically important infrastructure projects across many of the poorest Asian nations will be established. The World Bank and IMF need to be redesigned to meet the challenges facing the world economy The IMF, on the other hand, is there to support specific governments with short-term liquidity challenges. The IMF is also not far behind the World Bank with the volume of increasingly vociferous criticism. Witness the Greek debt crisis for a perfect example of the IMF’s failings. Clearly, the World Bank and the IMF need to be redesigned totally to meet the challenges facing today’s world economy. Chinese cultural values —such as togetherness, friendship and pacifism — will infuse the AIIB’s and Asia’s overall development Perhaps any redesign may follow the approach taken by China and the AIIB, such as inclusivity and engagement, rather than the United States-led aggressive and arrogant approach. Fundamentally, it should be accepted the world over that the launch of the AIIB and the rise of China will inevitably lead to a consequential rise in stability, peace and prosperity across Asia, which, in time, will spread worldwide. Chinese cultural values — still shaped largely by Confucian philosophy, such as togetherness, friendship and pacifism — will infuse the AIIB’s and Asia’s overall development. There is nothing to be feared, but much for the West to gain.

What they say The formal signing (of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank articles of association) marks an important next step in our plan to build a deeper partnership among the governments, companies and entrepreneurs of Britain and the fast-growing economies of Asia. The AIIB will help to finance vital infrastructure for the Asian and world economies, and I believe that our involvement at its birth will help to unlock enormous opportunities for British companies and British jobs. George Osborne, Britain’s chancellor of the exchequer More funding for infrastructure will help the poor, and we are pleased to be working with China and others to help the AIIB hit the ground running. We view the AIIB as an important new partner that shares a common goal: ending extreme poverty. The AIIB will join us and other development banks in addressing the huge infrastructure needs that are critical to ending poverty, reducing inequalities and boosting shared prosperity. Jim Yong Kim, World Bank president We hope the AIIB will play a role as a financial institution that contributes to Asia’s development while meeting the standards of international institutions, including in governance. Yoshihide Suga, Japan’s chief cabinet secretary The Asian Development Bank is committed to working closely and co-financing with the AIIB to address the vast infrastructure needs facing Asia by using our long experience and expertise.
