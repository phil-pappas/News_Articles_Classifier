Ed Buchholz , who has overseen the Hyatt Regency Denver at the Colorado Convention Center for seven years, is leaving to take the helm at the Grand Hyatt San Antonio. Replacing him at 1,100-room Hyatt Regency will be Greg Leonard , who headed up the Grand Hyatt Denver for five years before leaving to take over the Hyatt Regency San Antonio in 2013. Buchholz oversaw the Hyatt Regency — second in rooms locally only to the Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel — during a time when the number of rooms in the core of the Mile High City nearly doubled and tourism boomed. During that time, his hotel achieved financial success, promoted more than 300 workers internally or to other Hyatt properties and was ranked among the city’s five best hotels on TripAdvisor. “I think we’ve lived up to what the expectations of this hotel were as it was being conceived,” Buchholz said of the 10-year-old property. Leonard, meanwhile, returns to a town where he spent 15 years at multiple properties and was known as a philanthropic leader for his work with charities like the Bike MS Colorado Team and the Colorado Special Olympics. Upon returning, he will oversee a renovation of the Hyatt Regency’s 60,600 square feet of meeting and event space. His return is sparking some excitement among city hospitality and tourism officials. “ Greg Leonard is a true leader, and we welcome his return to Denver,” said Richard Scharf , president and CEO of Visit Denver. “We feel his contribution in many ways from his community involvement to his efforts to improve the Colorado experience by delivering exceptional hotels for all to enjoy.” \nWant Denver Travel   Business Pulse", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T21:45:43.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
