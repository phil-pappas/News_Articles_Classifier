Air Greenland, Greenland’s flag carrier, is ERA’s newest airline member and was the third airline to join ERA in 2015, bringing the number of airlines in membership to 52.\nMcNamara’s meeting with Air Greenland underlines ERA’s commitment to working with and representing its members’ concerns. Visits to members build on the trust that Europe’s regional carriers have in the association’s influence with Europe’s regulatory bodies and ensure that the association is fully equipped to represent their interests in its lobbying and communication campaigns.\nFounded in 1960, Air Greenland offers flights to, from and within Greenland. With a fleet of 35 aircraft, Air Greenland flies domestic routes and operates transatlantic flights to Iceland and Denmark. Michael Højgaard comments: “Simon’s visit to Air Greenland has been of great value to both parties. It has given ERA a greater understanding of the challenges that Air Greenland faces operating in Arctic airspace and has highlighted the opportunities and benefits that we can expect from membership of the association as we work to develop Greenland’s tourist industry.”\nSimon McNamara adds: “Air Greenland typifies what regional aviation provides to business and communities – it flies in difficult conditions, provides a vital lifeline to its domestic community and plays a key role in opening up economic and tourist development in Greenland. This visit, along with those to ERA’s other members, strengthens the association’s relationships with members and allows a vital insight into the challenges that they face, ensuring that the association can better represent their concerns before Europe’s regulatory bodies.”\nRelated Posts Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building Air Greenland – third new airline to join ERA in 2015 Austrian Airlines Financial Results as at 30 September 2013: Positive result gives optimism for break-even in 2013 Estonian Air grows significantly!
