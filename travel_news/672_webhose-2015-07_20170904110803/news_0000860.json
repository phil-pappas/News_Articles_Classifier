They plan to undertake major investments in growing markets and attract tourists from countries like India and China. The plans include promoting sustainable, natural and eco – tourism in Sweden’s countryside and increase the number of nights spent in the country. In September, SAS will open a new route direct to Hong Kong. There are also plans to create a direct connection to New Delhi. \n\n\n“Tourism is an important industry that the government wants to focus more on. It is the combination of nature and the environment which attracts many international tourists to Sweden each year. Keeping this in mind, we will invest a total of SEK 70 million up to 2017 in the tourism industry.” says Economic Development and Innovation Minister Mikael Damberg. \n\nJan Campbell Westlind, Consul, Consulate General of Sweden in Mumbai said, “Sweden is one of Europe’s most fastest growing & popular tourist destination and India is already the country sending one of the largest groups of tourists to Sweden. The number of guest nights have doubled over the past 10 years with Stockholm reaching a new record of 11.8 million guest nights. It is primarily the international guest nights that are on the increase. Sweden is an alluring destination with plenty of things to see and do. The discerning Indian audience that has a taste for unique one of a kind experience could explore Swedish Lapland, West Coast archipelago, Gothenburg and Abisko National Park – the last European wilderness. We are also promoting Swedish cuisine in a big way. These investment efforts are primarily meant to increase cooperation between our two nations as both India and Sweden are perfectly poised for a symbiotic relationship in which Sweden could offer what the Indian traveler is looking forward to on his holiday in Sweden. We welcome you to Sweden and the heart of Scandinavia”. \n\nAbout The Consulate General of Sweden: Established in September 2012, the jurisdiction of the Swedish Consulate General covers Maharashtra, Gujarat and Goa – an area comprising of a whopping 173 million people.
