Minnesota Public Radio reports on the museum's deal to open a temporary location at the Bloomington megamall , with attractions like Ball-Rama and Curious George moving into the mall's third floor. The 4,400-square-foot space will open in September and run through January 2017. That's roughly the time planned for an expansion and renovation project at the Children's Museum, which will add more more exhibits, a huge climbing area and water-play features . About 90 percent of the funding for the project has been raised, with money coming from state of Minnesota, 3M Co., St. Paul, Target Corp. and Best Buy, among other donors. The museum will be open for much of the time but will close in fall 2016 as work is completed.
