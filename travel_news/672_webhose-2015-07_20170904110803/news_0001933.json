The British Airways flight from London to Houston was diverted Wednesday to Boston's Logan International Airport.\nProsecutors said Halliwell was drunk and began yelling at a 14-year-old girl travelling with her family. They said he became aggressive when flight attendants tried to calm him and then struck his female companion in the face with the back of his hand.\nHalliwell, 46, is from Aspull, a village in Greater Manchester, England. His lawyer did not immediately return a call seeking comment Thursday.\nAn East Boston Municipal Court judge set Halliwell's bail at $5,000. Halliwell is due back in court on July 29.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T20:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T01:27:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
