With streets lined with Burberry and Max Mara outposts as well as boutiques by Lithuanian designers, the charming 13th-century historic center labyrinth flows seamlessly into the newer boulevards, and remains a deeply integrated part of the local fabric. Much of Vilnius retains its bleak Soviet-era sprawl, which you’ll pass on the 10-minute drive from the airport, but it’s a city in transition — and with Lithuania’s adoption of the euro this year, expect the city that’s often heralded as one of the cheapest in Europe to become even more accessible to travelers. If you’re in town from Sept. 4 to 6, join the locals to celebrate the end of summer with Sostines Dienos, the Vilnius City Fiesta — when open-air concerts pop up across the city, and the Gedimino Prospektas boulevard transforms into a street market.\nFriday 1. Walking Tour | 1 p.m.\nA leisurely meander through the winding lanes of Vilnius’s Old Town is a must for getting acclimated to the mishmash of architectural influences, ranging from the majestic to the Mad Hatter-ish. Start at the 16th-century Gates of Dawn, the only surviving remnant of the city’s original defensive wall (you’ll see a steady flow of religious pilgrims heading toward the chapel erected within). Continue north along Ausros Vartu Gatve toward the main town plaza, flanked by the neo-Classical Town Hall and the imposing Baroque St. Casimir’s Church, topped by an enormous black crown. Originally built as a Catholic church in the 17th century, it became a Russian Orthodox Church soon after, and was a museum of atheism under Soviet occupation. Pass Vilnius University — established in 1579; there are guided tours for 1.50 euros, about $1.60 at $1.08 to the euro — and take a detour toward the Vilnia River to gaze upon the brick-clad Gothic spires of St. Anne’s Church, constructed for the wife of Vytautas the Great, one of Lithuania’s most powerful rulers. End your walk in Cathedral Square, home to the country’s main Catholic cathedral. The sprawling plaza is also a popular spot for concerts, street fairs and skateboarders.\n 36 Hours in Vilnius Explore street view, find things to do in Vilnius and sign in to your Google account to save your map.", "external_links": ["http://www.vilniusfestivals.lt/EN/vilnius-city-fiesta/", "http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?libraries=places&client=gme-nyt&sensor=false&signed_in=true&v=3.exp&channel=mapmaker"], "published": "2015-07-08T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T22:04:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
