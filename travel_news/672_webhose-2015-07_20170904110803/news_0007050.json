Africans and friends of Africa from the Diaspora are presented with a unique opportunity to attend and participate in The International Roots Festival 2016.\nSource:-Gambia Tourism\nRelated Posts Prince Harry enjoys New Zealand island escape Chelsea Football Club Hosts Leaders Sport Summit 2013, the world’s most Prestigious Sport Business Summit Destination NSW Regional Manager UK And Germany Appointed Are redundancies ‘a normal part of business’?
