That will increase the space available for flight operations and reduce gate delays according to the presentation. \nIn addition, the new facility will be connected to ferry and rail service. The new terminal will have three times the security screening space along with increased concession and retail space. \n\"This new investment is expected to generate an additional 8,000 direct jobs, and 18,000 total jobs in the region, middle class jobs,\" said Vice President Biden. \nBiden hailed the project as an example of the federal government cutting red tape to speed up the process of designing and approving the new facility. \nConstruction is set to begin next month with new facilities opening in 39 months, and the completed project 18 months after that. \nThe first phase of the project will cost $4 billion, half of which will come from private funds, said Cuomo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T15:57:59.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
