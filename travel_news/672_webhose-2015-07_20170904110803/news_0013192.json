Many people enjoy traveling all across Europe and other parts of the planet. The food, culture, music, and people around the world can enrich your life. However, dangers abound, especially for those who are out of the areas they are comfortable with. A few travel safety tips can keep you safe no matter where you are in the world. \n\nSplit Up Your Forms of Payment \nWhen you are at home in your comfort zone, you probably carry all of your forms of payment together. You keep your cash, credit cards, debit cards, and checks in your wallet in your pants or your purse. However, when you are traveling, it is in your best interest to keep at least one form of payment separate from the rest. You are more likely to lose your wallet or purse when you are traveling due to different factors. For one, traveling can be very distracting. You are there to see the sights and sounds so you might get distracted. This makes you more likely to leave your jacket or purse behind and if your money is in that item, you are going to be completely out of money. Also, certain areas and activities indicate to others that you are a tourist. Predators will prey on tourists because they know they will be carrying money and will likely be distracted. \n\nScan Your Major Documents \nIn the past, it was standard practice to photocopy your documents and put them in a different part of your luggage. However, that is old school. You should scan your passport, driver license, visa, and other items that you might need to identify yourself. You should then email them to yourself so that you always have them at the ready in case you lose the originals. \n\nBuy Medical Insurance \nIf you have some sort of illness, you might be wary about traveling. Being away from the doctors and facilities that you are comfortable with can be frightening. What do you do if you have an asthma attack in a foreign country? With the type of insurance provided by a company such as medicaltravelcompared.co.uk , you can insure yourself against those sorts of possibilities. \n\nTell Someone Your Plans \nWhen you leave your area, you should tell someone your plans. In the past, it was customary to alert your neighbours and have them pick up your mail so that no one knew you were away from the house. Mail and newspapers piling up is a red flag to criminals that a house in unoccupied. These days, social media is incredibly popular. This means that someone probably knows you are out of the country. However, you should be sure to let someone know where you will be and when. That way, this person will notice if you did not return when you said you were going to or are not where you said you would be. They can then alert the appropriate authorities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T15:53:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
