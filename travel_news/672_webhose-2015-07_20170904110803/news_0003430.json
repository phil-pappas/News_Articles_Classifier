This includes Broadway Macau, a hawker-style street market with live entertainment, and the Ponte 16 Macau 3D Museum, which features 3D exhibits that visitors can pose with. \n\nNew hotels such as The Ritz-Carlton, Macau and JW Marriott Hotel Macau have also been launched, spelling good news for tourists. Hoteliers, now facing new competition, are working with the government to offer more attractive rates and lure more travellers, said MGTO deputy director Cheng Wai Tong. \n\n“We’ve just launched a campaign with a hotel group, offering attractive packages to tourists from Hong Kong, Taiwan and China, starting from now to December. \n\n“There are currently 30,000 rooms available for this campaign and we expect about 20,000 visitors to enjoy the offer,” said Vong. \n\nThree hotels are currently participating in the campaign, although Vong was unable to name them at press time. More properties are expected to join if the campaign proves successful, she added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T13:44:11.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
