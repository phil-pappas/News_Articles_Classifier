ALL OTHER USE PROHIBITED. – Tips on keeping the post-vacation glow. By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM The New York Times \nA colleague recently returned from a trip to Europe with that unmistakable just-back-from-vacation glow. Striving to hold on to it for as long as possible, she deployed various strategies including placing her used boarding passes front and center on her desk and leaving receipts from the TV Tower in Berlin and the Eiffel Tower in Paris on a bedroom chest of drawers that she passes each morning. \n“It just surrounds me,” she said of the strategic placement of her vacation mementos. “It sustains that warm vibe.” \nShe also made a point of incorporating items that she bought during her trip into her daily life back in New York. \nIn Berlin, for instance, she picked up a silver Bodum milk frother with the idea that when she returned home she would make her coffee the way a friend made it for her each morning in Berlin.

Indeed, one such study, published in 2010 in Applied Research in Quality of Life, surveyed 1,530 Dutch individuals and noted that only vacationers who said they had a “very relaxed” trip benefited in terms of post-trip happiness. And even among that group, the post-vacation high lasted a mere two weeks or so. \nOne possible reason that travelers have an easier time anticipating a vacation than hanging on to its afterglow is that, in general, anticipation evokes stronger feelings and images. Research published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology in 2007 by Leaf Van Boven at the University of Colorado at Boulder and Laurence Ashworth at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, found that “the tendency to report more intense emotions during anticipation than during retrospection is robust and pervasive in everyday life.” \nAll is not necessarily lost the moment you step off the plane. There are some things you can do before you travel and when you return home that may help keep you in a holiday state of mind. \n1. Plan : Make sure that your vacation is likely to provide you with happy memories by nailing down in advance the kind of details that can trip you up. Well-planned vacations lower stress, according to research by Shawn Achor, the founder of Good Think, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Massachusetts, along with Michelle Gielan, founder of the Institute for Applied Positive Research. \n“Poorly planned and stressful vacations eliminate the positive benefit of time away,” Achor wrote in a blog series for the Harvard Business Review last year. “A positive, well-managed vacation can make you happier and less stressed, and you can return with more energy at work and with more meaning in your life.” \n2. Reminisce : Most people snap back to their particular baseline level of happiness shortly after returning from a vacation. But psychologists say that reminiscing about a trip, even long after it’s over, can bring deep pleasure in the present. \n“Flipping through a photo album or watching old video clips (us at the Grand Canyon, me driving my motorbike) helps us relive the positive experience and the positive feelings we had at the time,” writes Sonja Lyubomirsky, a psychology professor at the University of California, Riverside, in “The Myths of Happiness.” This can also be accomplished, she and others have said, by savoring the details of a trip (the smell of jasmine in the park, the sound of the orchestra in the amphitheater) and sharing them with others. \n“Rather than letting our paid-for possessions and experiences to gather dust on shelves and in closets and memories,” Lyubomirsky wrote, “we can either literally re-experience them in the present (e.g. by taking out the faded Trivial Pursuit) or metaphorically (e.g. by reminiscing about spring break).” \n3. Retreat : “Nowhere is there a more idyllic spot, a vacation home more private and peaceful, than in one’s own mind, especially when it is furnished in such a way that the merest inward glance induces ease,” wrote Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius in a translation of his “Meditations” by C. Scot Hicks and David V. Hicks. \n“Take this vacation as often as you like,” he continued, “and so charge your spirit.” \nKnowing I was in the market for post-vacation preservatives, another colleague shared with me that passage, which seems as relevant in the 2000s as it was in the 100s.
