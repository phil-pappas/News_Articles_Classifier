The hospitality industry came out in force as 1,200 people gathered at Grosvenor House to reward and celebrate individuals, companies and initiatives in the hospitality industry. A standing ovation was given to Chairman and founder of Springboard, Stephen Moss CBE who was astonished to be announced winner of the Special Award, sponsored by Filmbankmedia, for his amazing contribution to the hospitality. \n25 Years ago, Stephen was a leading figure on the London restaurant scene owning the well-known Drakes in Chelsea and as a partner in 190 Queensgate - the home of the then Restaurant Association of Great Britain restaurant industry – along with Anthony Worrall Thompson, Roy Ackerman CBE, Richard Shepherd CBE and others. He was frustrated by how difficult it was to attract home grown talent into what he regarded as an exciting industry full of opportunity and jumped at the chance to head a working party designed to address that very issue. Keen to provide a practical solution and not another report that would have no other purpose than to gather dust, the outcome was Springboard, a London-based drop-in centre providing specialist careers advice, promoting careers in the industry and focussed on reaching schools and unemployed people through its partnership with the hotel and catering job centre in Denmark Street. In 1997, with help from a three year grant from Government, the Springboard concept was taken nationwide. Since then, The Springboard Charity and Springboard UK have gone from strength to strength and, 25 years later, Stephen remains Chairman. He was also long-serving member of the executive of the Restaurant Association and a Trustee of People 1st, the Sector Skills Council for hospitality, travel and tourism. In 1992 he was awarded an MBE for services to the restaurant industry and, in 2002, a CBE for his contribution towards education and training. “For 25 years, Stephen has made a difference to people’s lives and made a difference to business through his work with Springboard. His amazing efforts to inspire and educate people about careers in hospitality and raise the profile of careers in this industry make him a well-deserved winner of this award.” Anne Pierce, CEO, Springboard. “It has been a wonderful journey and I am so proud of what has been achieved but, we couldn’t have got there as a charity without our Chief Executive, Anne Pierce, and the Springboard team and the wonderful industry support we have had from the very start 25 years ago.” Stephen Moss, CBE, Springboard Chairman He also is Chairman of Bibendum PLB Group and Bonasystems Europe. He is also a Director of Safestay PLC. Stephen was one of 22 winners at the glittering awards ceremony this evening. Other winners include The Dorchester Collection, 45 Park Lane who won The Best Employer Award.
