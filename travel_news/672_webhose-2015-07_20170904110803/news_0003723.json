Revenue fell 3% for the quarter, but still beat estimates. \nIn Europe and the U.S., the beverage maker has been rolling out smaller soda cans for higher prices and has benefited from an increased marketing budget and the \"share a Coke\" campaign. The company has also teamed up with JetBlue ( JBLU ) to share travel rewards with customers. \nMust Read: 16 Rock-Solid Dividend Stocks With 50 Years of Increasing Dividends and Market-Beating Performance \nCoke's other products include drinks such as PowerAde, Fanta, Sprite and Dasani.
