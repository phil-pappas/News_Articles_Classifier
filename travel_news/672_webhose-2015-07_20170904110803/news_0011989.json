In the company of Minister for Tourism & Culture, Alain St. Ange, P.S. for Tourism, Anne Lafortune and members of the press she gave details of the competition which is due to commence on July 29th. \n\nAs a specially made film advertising the competition played in the background, she told her audience that she hoped that the once-in-a-lifetime prize of a no-holds-barred, super VIP holiday to the islands would attract lively participation from across the globe. “Such a prize does not come along every day and, to my knowledge, this is the most expensive holiday that the Tourism Board has ever offered, including business class air tickets and VIP transfers; a 3-night stay at fabulous North Island; a 4-night stay at Seychelles’ Four Seasons Resort; an optional cruise among the Inner Islands as well as a surprise holiday package courtesy of the Tourism Board.” \n\nThe Seychelles Tourism Board is collaborating with Maven, a local creative agency specialising in print, web and TV, to assist them with the technicalities involved with running the competition which involves setting up a special website to host the uploaded videos. The video competition, which is aimed at amateur video makers who are non-resident in Seychelles, invites competitors to first register for the competition and then upload their own personal video of their Seychelles Experience which should be of no more than 2-minute’s duration. As the result of a voting mechanism that is still being refined, ten films will be shortlisted and submitted to a panel of judges to determine the winner. The ‘My Seychelles Experience’ video competition is scheduled to run from 29th July 2015 to late February 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T13:03:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
