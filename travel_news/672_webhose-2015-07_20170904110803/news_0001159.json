What crisis? Adv: \nJul 13, 2015 Adv: \nATHENS, Greece - While Greece as a nation struggles, Aegean, now in effect the national airline, flies on. It is a member of Star Alliance. \nThe carrier has put out a strong statement, which we have paraphrased slightly. The German newspaper Bild posted on its website a claim that Greek citizens could only book tickets by paying in cash. \nNot so. \nAegean Airlines and Olympic Air acknowledge the difficulties faced by the Greek people, and provide all Greek passengers with the opportunity to purchase tickets using cash, credit or debit cards. All offers are available to travel agencies. \nIn order to facilitate Greek passengers the airline has suspended the service fee of â‚¬20 for all tickets purchased with cash from ticket offices at Greek airports, as well as for tickets purchased by credit or debit card through its websites. The service fee applies only if a passenger purchases a ticket via the Aegean call centre. \nAegean Airlines, despite the current difficult conditions in Greece, maintains its relationships of trust with international banks and suppliers. Aegean was honoured with the Skytrax World Airline award 2015, as the best regional airline in Europe for the fifth year in a row.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T09:38:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
