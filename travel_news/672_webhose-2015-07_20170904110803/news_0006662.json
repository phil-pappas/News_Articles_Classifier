But the Chief Rabbinate declined to automatically renew Riskin’s appointment as chief rabbi and called for a hearing, which Riskin said he learned about through media reports.\nRiskin has been the chief rabbi of Efrat since 1983, when he helped found the settlement located in the Gush Etzion bloc of the West Bank.\nResponding to claims that some of his halachic rulings were deemed problematic by members of the Chief Rabbinate, Riskin said, “I am sure all of my decisions are based on accepted halachic precedent. Even the rulings that some viewed as too far outside the box are based on decisions by former chief rRabbis. This is a debate about differing ideological paths.”\nAdvertisement\nRiskin recently appointed a woman, Jennie Rosenfeld, to serve as a religious leader in Efrat, giving her the title “manhiga ruchanit,” or spiritual adviser. He has also come under fire from the Chief Rabbinate for his views on reforming the conversion process in Israel, supporting a government directive that was overturned by the Cabinet on Sunday that would have allowed municipal chief rabbis to form conversion courts rather than requiring potential converts to appear before four Chief Rabbinate-led courts.", "external_links": ["http://ots.org.il/female-spiritual-leader-efrat-jewish-week/", "http://www.jta.org/2015/05/28/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/targeting-modern-orthodox-rabbi-israeli-rabbinate-draws-battle-line"], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T01:49:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
