But how do you muddle through the process as a beginner and what are the potential pitfalls? See if the taxman can help “The Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS) and Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) are highly tax-advantageous schemes for investing in early-stage businesses,” says Ben Aronsten of investment hub Seedrs. “Many UK-based businesses that have raised investment on Seedrs have qualified for one of the two schemes, which investors can find highly appealing. \"Although, investors should invest in businesses that they believe in, not invest because of potential tax reliefs.” Keep plugging away Crowdfunding may sound like a system where you simply put your idea up on a website and the money rolls in, but you will need to promote your idea as widely as you can via social media and more traditional routes. You will also need to remind those who have expressed an interest and not yet made a commitment. “Like many of us, crowd investors tend to be 'pressure-prompted' so it's been in the closing weeks of our campaign that we've brought in much of our success,” says Ed Molyneux, CEO of accounting software business FreeAgent. \"There's a lot going on in everyone's lives, so it pays to keep reminding people that the offer's not open for ever.” Focus on the future “At the seed stage you may have to take investment from wherever you can,” says Grant Slatter, founder of Octer, a mobile device shopping business that achieved £1m of investment via Seedrs in just 24 hours. “If possible, choose people who can afford to invest in your next round if you perform well with the initial funds. Nothing speaks louder to new investors than your first investors participating fully in your second round.” Christian Mouysset of crowd-funded restaurant business Hummus Bros also thinks that SMEs should have their eye on future investment when seeking funds. “They need to think how much more they will need to raise over the course of their expansion,” he says. “They should get some strategic investors on board that can help the business expand and introduce them to investors that can help fund future stages. Look at alternatives to straight equity deals Convertible notes and bonds are an alternative to equity crowdfunding. Funding website Crowdcube offers larger businesses the chance to raise finance via debt-based investment bonds as well as the more usual crowdfunding for start-ups and SMEs. “Both options enable businesses to reap the rewards of crowdfunding that go above and beyond just raising finance,” says Crowdcube's co-founder, Luke Lang. “Advantages include customer engagement, a flexible approach and the competitive edge it can provide businesses in an era of co-creation.” Look at your idea as investors will “They say that no business plan ever survives contact with the market,” says Andrew Wordsworth, founder of E-Car Club, which was funded via Crowdcube. “If you haven’t achieved initial sales then there is a large amount of risk that your product isn’t actually valued by your target market, and hence it’s a much harder pitch to crowd investors. \"Customers can be your biggest advocate and our teams will often include them in the funding videos.” • For more advice on preparing your business for the tech challenges of the future, visit HP BusinessNow You may also be interested in: • Five ways to battle cybercrime • Five ways for SMEs to motivate staff to save costs • How to run a successful virtual office • Five of the best bookkeeping apps for SMEs • Top tips for SMEs on keeping overheads low", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T22:47:44.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
