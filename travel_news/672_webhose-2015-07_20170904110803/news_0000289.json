The seal swims away with the poor penguin writhing in its jaws. After landing we watch, enthralled, as the seal thrashes from side-to-side trying to remove the penguin’s skin, water spraying in an arch above it.

We head off in the other direction, winding our way through the icebergs in the silky still water.\nOur Zodiac driver spots a lone penguin lying on an iceberg and decides to cruise closer. Sure enough, another leopard seal appears. The penguin stands up, alert. The seal launches itself on to the iceberg several times unsuccessfully before taking its prize. Again, we watch as the seal thrashes about with its kill, kelp gulls and skua birds circling, waiting to devour the leftovers. A fur seal on an iceberg in Fournier Bay.

We head in that direction and soon see the whales swimming majestically along the shoreline.\nOccasionally, we hear the thundering roar of the glacier calving. Waves produced by the ice rush towards shore, sending the penguins scrambling up the beach. It’s quite a welcome.\nWhile we’re exploring, one of the ship’s scientists, American researcher Dr Ari Friedlaender, along with his team, are out taking biopsies of whales to record their age, gender, health and which population they are from. He also places video tags on as many as he can to observe their feeding patterns, sharing his findings with us back on the ship each night. Having him on board is one of the major drawcards of the Marine Mammals expedition, which is the last voyage of the season. Humpback whale fluke in Wilhelmina Bay. Picture: Angela Saurine Source: Supplied\nHaving Friedlaender on board also helps us gain access to the US research base Palmer Station, on Anvers Island, where about 40 people live during summer. Only 10 ships can visit each year, but the fact he has a laboratory there ensures we are one of them. We wander around the cluster of buildings learning about how the scientists live in such a remote location and the work they do, including conducting penguin and seal censuses via satellite, finding algae with medicinal qualities and climate change research.\nBeing a Russian ship built for scientific research, the Akademik Ioffe has more deck space than most other cruise ships and is quieter to benefit hydro-acoustic research.\nIt also has an internal ballast stabilisation system, which helps on the two days we spend crossing the notorious Drake Passage from Ushuaia, at the bottom of Argentina.\nWhile it looks rustic, the 98-passenger Akademik Ioffe is extremely comfortable, with a range of berths, a hot tub, sauna, massage room, library, basic dining room and a lounge and bar, where the cheeky Portuguese bartender Joao keeps us up late serving Antarctica-themed cocktails with ice we collect from icebergs during our daily excursions.

They include a nightclub manager from Los Angeles, a Lonely Planet guidebook author and a woman from the UK at the end of a two-year round-the-world cycling adventure.\nBefore setting foot on the mainland we stop at several islands along the Antarctic Peninsula, covering a 300km stretch of coast in a continent 1.5 times the size of Australia. First is Fournier Bay, also on Anvers Island, where we see a fur seal sunbathing on an iceberg, penguins darting in and out of the water swimming towards us, and three humpback whales puffing from their blowholes.\nWe spend the afternoon walking among Antarctica’s largest Gentoo penguin colony on Cuverville Island, home to about 12,000 breeding pairs and their chicks. We watch the comical chicks slipping and sliding on the ice, chasing their mums, begging for a feed of krill.\nPassengers are not allowed to go within 5m of penguins but they waddle right up to us, playing with camera straps and nibbling gloves.

As we break through the icebergs before us a humpback whale escorts us briefly, flicking its fluke out of the water next to the bow as it takes a dive.\nAt Wilhelmina Bay, where Friedlaender’s team counts more than 100 humpbacks, we see two whales spy hopping and breaching. At Half Moon Island we see chinstrap penguins, known for the black line across their chins, mating, fighting and practising collecting rocks with their beaks to make nests.\nOne day as we glide along the coast I am standing on the deck marvelling at the reflections of large icebergs in the glassy water and snow-capped mountains in the distance when I feel so overwhelmed by the beauty and majesty of the landscape that I start to cry. To my surprise I cannot stop for several minutes.\nI have been to some incredible places in the world, but Antarctica is the only one that has had that effect on me.\nThe writer was a guest of Chimu Adventures, One Ocean Expeditions and LAN Airlines.\nGO2\nANTARCTICA\nGETTING THERE\nLAN Airlines has seven one-stop flights per week from Sydney to Santiago, Chile on the new state-of-the-art Dreamliner aircraft with onward connections to Ushuaia via Buenos Aires, Argentina. Ph 1800 126 038 or see www.lan.com\nCRUISING THERE\nChimu Adventures offers 10-night Antarctica Peninsula Adventure on the Akademik Ioffe from US$7495 per person in a triple share cabin. Ph 1300 211 536 or see www.chimuadventures.com\nWHEN TO GO\nThe Akademik Ioffe sails to Antarctica from Ushuaia from November to March. The continent looks its most pristine early in the season while December to February is best for seeing penguin chicks, which are almost fully grown and fledged by March. Late season is the best time to see whales, when penguin chicks are becoming curious, but colonies can be smelly due to the build-up of poo.\nTRAVEL TIP\nOnly 100 passengers are allowed on shore at each site in Antarctica at a time, so it’s best to choose a ship like the Akedemik Ioffe, which carries a maximum of 96 passengers.", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/02/1227425/154995-d4eb7d80-e273-11e4-b60a-424ceb2f883c.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/02/1227425/154751-bf824438-e273-11e4-b60a-424ceb2f883c.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/02/1227425/155052-bc57a848-e273-11e4-b60a-424ceb2f883c.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/02/1227425/154641-ce6aa094-e273-11e4-b60a-424ceb2f883c.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/02/1227425/154805-d2dcd8e0-e273-11e4-b60a-424ceb2f883c.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T21:46:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
