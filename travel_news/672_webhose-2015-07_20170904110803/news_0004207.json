Further, Apple Watch sales have declined 90% since opening week according to a recent study by Slice Intelligence. As with any new product, there are critics who are poised to pounce on every glitch, hiccup or stumble. On the opposite end of the spectrum are the starry-eyed enthusiasts who are loath to believe Apple can do anything wrong.\nI don’t have either of those perspectives, but I am firmly in the camp that believes the smart watch form factor is here to stay. I also believe the day is fast approaching when the only people who don’t have a smart watch among their personal technology portfolio are the financially unable or diehard Luddites.\nWhat the Apple Watch lacks currently is a killer app . Entrepreneurs seeking to develop that app need to change the consumer’s mindset from “Why would I want this?” to “How can I live without this?”\nAs with any new product launch, entrepreneurs must focus on the opportunity context and create massive new value for buyers. The opportunity context refers to the existing conditions for value creation, such as the buyer problem, the competitor landscape or design constraints. The current opportunity context of the Apple Watch centers on factors such as its wearability, internal hardware, and battery life. However, there are three factors I believe to be most relevant for entrepreneurs seeking to develop the killer app for the Apple Watch.\nThink Wrist-Centric\nThe Apple Watch doesn’t do much the iPhone can’t do. This is a lingering and appropriate critique of the watch. Why pay hundreds for a device whose primary functions duplicate those already on your phone? The few Apple Watch apps that are wrist-centric (e.g., heart rate monitor, health sensors) are those most often cited as potentially, but not yet, killer.\nApp developers need to focus on the uniqueness of the wrist both as a body part and as a location vis-a-vis the user’s eyes, mouth, and opposite hand. The wrist is already culturally accepted as the location of important information. The traditional watch tells time not just for the user, but for others—when you wear a watch, how many people ask you for the time? Perhaps the wrist can become the location for other culturally relevant information. Good starting points may be air temperature, pollen levels, or air quality.\nAs a body part, the wrist is not particularly useful except as a sensitive access point to individual homeostatic and physiological data. Undoubtedly, at some point these will be leveraged via developing sensor technologies. How about an app that reads one’s hydration level and suggests appropriate liquid intake?\nThink Arm-Centric\nPotentially more fruitful may be thinking of the Apple Watch as arm-centric. The arms are extremely vibrant evolutionary adaptations that have been put to great use. Arms lift, throw, and hug. They also gesture and communicate (think pointing). A killer app for the Apple Watch may help us do more with our arms. Perhaps we need an app that weighs objects before we attempt to lift them completely. That could prevent a lot of back injuries, medical leave bills, and OSHA lawsuits.\nThink Interpersonal Communication\nMany killer apps (email, FaceBook, Twitter) enable deeper and better forms of interpersonal communication. The arms are highly useful communication tools for humans. Long before people created language, they used their arms to gesture, point, and nudge. These more primitive forms of communication have not left us. Just watch anyone giving a speech and notice that speakers who use their arms and hands to gesture effectively are usually superior communicators. Perhaps there is need for an app that understands speaker gestures and interprets them for listeners with vision impairments, enabling them to participate in a richer communication experience.\nThere is a killer app waiting to be discovered for the Apple Watch. I believe focusing on these three primary factors of the Apple Watch opportunity context are most likely to lead entrepreneurs to the coveted killer app.\nAlso on Forbes:\nMost Stylish Apple Watch Accessories\nUCCS :: COB :: EPIIC :: Kyron :: ansrsource :: Books", "external_links": ["http://www.thestreet.com/video/13225515/apple-ships-42m-watches-in-q2-according-to-one-wall-st-firm.html?puc=yahoov&cm_ven=YAHOOV", "http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=Thomas+Duening", "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-watch-may-not-be-ticking-with-customers-2015-07-07", "http://kyron.me/", "http://www.uccs.edu/~business/"], "published": "2015-07-21T21:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T20:49:55.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
