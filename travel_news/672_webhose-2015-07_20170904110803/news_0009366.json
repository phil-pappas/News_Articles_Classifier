Jones said the way Goodes responded to being named Australian of the Year did not sit well with the public either.\n“You know, the man is always a victim,” Jones said.\n“Then he became Australian of the Year and tells us that we’re all racists. Every time he speaks, Australia is a racist nation.\n“I mean, there are 71 Indigenous players. They are in rugby league, they are in rugby union. They are everywhere. They’re playing tennis, and people don’t boo them. They’re booing Adam Goodes because they don’t like him and they don’t like his behaviour.”\nAccording to Alan Jones, Adam Goodes always plays the victim. Source: Supplied\nGoodes is said to be contemplating to hang up his boots over the saga that has dominated headlines.\nAccording to Jones, that’s just “typical Adam Goodes”.\n“They [the booing crowds] just don’t like the fellow. And Adam Goodes can fix all this by changing his behaviour. But what’s he say today? ‘Oh, I’m going to leave. I may have to resign. I can’t hack it.’\n“Ask the little 13-year-old girl how she handled that. She was paraded over the national media as a person who really had to apologise.\n“She wrote a letter and apologised. I mean, the poor little thing, 13 years of age, disabled mother. I mean, give me a break.\n“The bloke’s a rich Australian athlete. He humiliated a 13-year-old girl who didn’t even know what she was saying, and the public haven’t forgotten it. Someone’s got to ask the question: why are they booing Adam Goodes and not the other 70 Indigenous AFL players? Adam Goodes can fix this by changing his behaviour. He again today plays the victim.”\nRoss Greenwood says will continue to boo Adam Goodes. Source: News Corp Australia\nChannel 9 finance editor Ross Greenwood, meanwhile, openly admitted to booing Goodes — and said he would continue to do so.\nSpeaking on Today , Greenwood said: “I’ve booed Adam Goodes. I’ve booed Adam Goodes every time Richmond plays the Swans and the reason is I’m a diehard Richmond supporter. He stages for free kicks, I boo him.\n“It’s going nothing to do with his race. It’s got nothing to do with me being a racist.\n“I’m a football fan and therefore as a result if I see something not right on the football field I’ll boo him.\n“That has got nothing to do with the colour of his skin.”\nAdam Goodes is said to be considering retirement. Source: AAP\nSo sensitive is the issue, two prominent football identities, former Hawthorn star Dermott Brereton and sports journalist Rebecca Wilson, traded blows in a fierce radio spat yesterday , which ended in legal threats.\nGoodes was not at Tuesday’s training and was unsure whether he would play this Saturday against the Adelaide Crows in Sydney.\n“It’s got to a point where it isn’t going away and we need to stop it,” Sydney coach John Longmire said.\n“Adam will have a couple of days away from the football club and take a breath about it.”\nFormer Swans premiership player Michael O’Laughlin, who has been a father figure to Goodes, told Fairfax the dual Brownlow medallist was “really struggling”, and wouldn’t rule out retirement.\n“There’s only so much a man can take before his legs start to buckle,” he said.\n“Adam’s a very strong person who’s done a lot for the game ... but don’t assume that these things are just easily washed over and don’t affect him in some way. he’s sick and tired of what’s been happening for a long time.”\nO’Laughlin also told of the heartbreaking moment his son, who looks up to Goodes, asked him to explain why the player was being treated so poorly.\n“Watching the footy on the weekend, I wanted to turn it off,” he told The Australian .\n“I had my seven-year-old son ask me, ‘Dad, why are they booing uncle?’\n“It was really hard to explain ... trying to articulate that to a lad who has no idea who has no idea what racism is was really hard to do.”\nGoodes’ mother Lisa Sansbury told Seven News the ordeal had been “heart-wrenching”.\n“I’m very saddened by it all,” she said.\n“I think it’s starting to take an effect with him now, and emotionally you see it’s having an effect on him.”\nOriginally published as Alan Jones unleashes on Goodes", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/sport/afl/dermott-brereton-and-rebecca-wilson-have-huge-fight-over-adam-goodes-on-melbourne-radio-station-sen/story-fndv7pj3-1227460701660", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/29/1227461/821494-0cf3b77a-35ac-11e5-a34b-af8954b82b5f.jpg", "http://www.smh.com.au/afl/sydney-swans/sydney-swans-star-adam-goodes-considering-retirement-over-booing-scandal-20150728-gimdb4.html", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/29/1227461/693222-21eb16e8-35a0-11e5-a34b-af8954b82b5f.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/29/1227461/693578-f6bf5402-359f-11e5-a34b-af8954b82b5f.jpg", "http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/afl/adam-goodes-abuse-why-are-they-booing-uncle-why-indeed/story-fnca0u4y-1227460942830", "http://www.news.com.au/sport/afl/alan-jones-unleashes-on-victim-adam-goodes/story-fndv8ujy-1227461693270"], "published": "2015-07-29T22:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T07:53:02.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
