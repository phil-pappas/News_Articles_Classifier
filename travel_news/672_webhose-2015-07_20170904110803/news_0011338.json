It may be called “Billionaires’ Beach,” but the pristine views along one of Malibu’s most exclusive coastlines are now more accessible. After a decade-long legal fight that pitted public access advocates against a wealthy homeowner who refused to build a path, the California Coastal Commission will open a third accessway a few hundred yards down the beach from Geffen's home Tuesday, July 7, 2015.(AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File) \n\"It's an amazing stretch of coast that should be open to everyone,\" said Charles Lester, the commission's executive director.\nCarbon Beach is renowned for its majestic shoreline and high net-worth celebrities and homeowners. Heavy-hitters include Larry Ellison, former chief executive of Oracle Corp.; Hard Rock Cafe co-founder Peter Morton; and entertainment mogul David Geffen.\nGeffen spent years fighting against public access before opening up a path promised in 1983 in exchange for a remodeling permit. At the time, it was one of about 1,300 promised walkways, though many never opened.\nState law guarantees the public beach access up to the mean high tide line. But in areas like Malibu, many affluent and influential residents have taken extensive measures to keep beachgoers out of their sandy backyards.\nThe lengthy legal quarrel over Carbon Beach access dates to the 1980s. The Coastal Commission issued Lisette and Norman Ackerberg building permits in exchange for providing a public path beside their house.\nThe Ackerbergs put up various impediments, including a 9-foot-high wall, large boulders and a tennis court to resist building an easement.\nIn 2009, Lisette Ackerberg, whose husband died in 2004, sued the commission to overturn its order opening a public pathway. California's 2nd District Court of Appeals ruled in favour of the agency.\nIn 2013, the commission approved a settlement requiring Ackerberg to pay $1.1 million in fines. Some of the money will go to the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority to operate and maintain the pathway and reimburse the attorney general's office for legal fees.\nAckerberg said she and her husband considered themselves advocates for both the environment and people with disabilities. She offered to build a wheelchair-accessible path to address the lack of accommodation for the disabled.\n\"If this battle brings ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) access to other accessways, that is progress and a worthy endeavour,\" Ackerberg wrote in an email.\nGraham Hamilton, chairman of the West LA/Malibu chapter of the Surfrider Foundation, said he is pleased with the opening, but he also acknowledged the remaining challenges ahead.\n\"It's a small victory in a very large battle,\" Hamilton said. \"We hope that any development that is going to take place in the future remembers the citizens' rights under the California Coastal Act and state constitution, which allow public access to coastal lines.\"\nThe Carbon Beach West pathway, as it's officially known, will be open between sunrise and sunset.\nThe commission plans to open at least 18 additional paths in Malibu.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T13:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T19:32:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
