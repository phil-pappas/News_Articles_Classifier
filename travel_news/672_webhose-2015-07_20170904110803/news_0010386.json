The era of hi-fi separates - chunky speakers, monolithic amp, CD player and a veritable spaghetti junction of cables - is over. If you're not streaming music wirelessly, you're really not with the program. The trouble is, many of us forked out a lot of money for those hi-fi separates and the sound quality some wireless streaming units offer isn't necessarily on a par with those beloved speakers we bought a decade ago. Thankfully, Gramofon, a clever little device that began life as a hugely popular Kickstarter project last year, turns your existing speakers into a bang-up-to-date music-streaming jukebox, hooked up to Spotify and a wealth of similar services. Simply plug the 8cm square box into your old stereo, connect it to your smartphone (Android or iOS) via WiFi and bingo. No need to take your old system down to the charity shop just yet. This is the Gramofon from Fon on Vimeo . Gramofon also acts as a WiFi hotspot and can bring WiFi to parts of your home that are not connected well. The really good bit?
