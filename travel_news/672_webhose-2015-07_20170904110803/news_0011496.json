Both of the issuers are locally rated Triple A credits.\nDCM bankers said they have not seen a precedent in recent times of an issuer cancelling an offering days after pricing it. The bonds were to be settled on Monday.\n“It happens only in India and that too with state-owned issuers,” said a DCM banker on the deal. “We are trying to pacify the investors,” he added.\nThe company has communicated its decision to arrangers by phone, sources said.\nBids for the Power Grid’s offering were called on Wednesday, a day on which Asian credit markets plunged, and drew 20 arrangers with submissions in the 8.49-8.60 percent range.\nOf the 20 arrangers, 17 took part in the final sale with SBI Caps taking the biggest amount of 11.22 billion rupees.\nThe bonds of both companies will be repaid in 12 annual equal instalments from the fourth year after issuance.\n 3:50 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T14:53:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
