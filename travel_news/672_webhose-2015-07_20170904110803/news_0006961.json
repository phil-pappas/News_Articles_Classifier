Since we were traveling all that way, I suggested that we visit more than one county just to get our money’s worth. We decided to add Munich to the itinerary (Oktoberfest would be happening) and the Netherlands was nearby so it seemed like a no brainer. So, I headed to Amsterdam with my friends, just wanting to have a good time. I never thought I’d meet my wife. \nWe had just finished dinner when my friend noticed a bar full of women. Obviously, we went in, and sat at the bar and ordered a drink. While sitting at the bar, a woman’s voice from behind me said, “Are you Dutch?” My response was, “Do I look Dutch?,” and we shared a laugh. \nRelated: #RealTravel, Love on the Road: India \nHer name was Lauren, and I thought she was beautiful from the moment I met her. During that initial meeting we just talked in the bar as she split her time between me and the group she was out with. I wanted to get her attention, so we went outside and shared our first kiss. I also asked her to be my girlfriend — what can I say, I’m a man who knows what he wants! \nThat night I got her number and promised to call her the next night. We were staying at a hostel, so I called her from a pay phone the next day and we made plans to met at Dam Square. When I arrived, she was waiting there with her friend Sabine and we met up with my friends at a bar not far from our hostel. I remember her asking me if I could return to Amsterdam in April for Queen’s Day (now King’s Day), and I said yes. \nWhen we left the bar that night we just walked, talked, and kissed. We agreed to see each other again the next morning, which was my final day in Amsterdam. \nSo, I ditched my friends (they totally understood) to hang out with the pretty Dutch girl. We took a canal ride, strolled around the city, and even went to Madame Tussauds. Even though we spent such a short time together, I knew she was something special. Still, the next day I left for Germany. \nInitially, we stayed in touch via email, and I still referred to her as my girlfriend. I don’t know if love at first sight is real, but I can definitely say that we clicked instantly. From the moment we met, I felt comfortable around Lauren and didn’t want to be away from her. She was also gorgeous! \nRelated: Love on the Road — They Met at a Hostel in Peru \nWhen I returned home we stayed in touch anyway we could — via email, Skype, Windows Live, text messages, and phone calls. At the time, I worked for a British company that required me to make international calls daily, so calling Lauren wasn’t a big deal. I would even leave my home computer on and remote into it from work so we could talk on messenger. \nEvery time we talked, my feelings for Lauren grew more and more. About a month after we met, I told her that I loved her. Well, actually I sent it to her in a text while I was on the way to my cousin’s wedding — but it counts. It was difficult to be in such a long-distance relationship because we wanted to be together so badly. Lauren and I were on different continents and had to deal with a nine-hour time difference! \nFinally, in April of 2008, approximately seven months after we met, I finally had the chance to visit Lauren in Amsterdam. Words cannot describe how great it was to see and hold Lauren again. We spent a few days together, I went to Mumbai for two weeks, and then spent three more days with her before heading back to L.A. After that, we never went more than three or four months without seeing each other. I had four weeks of vacation that I would use to visit, and she was a student at the time, so she would visit me during the winter and summer. Every time we had to separate after a visit was hard, so we eventually made plans for her to move to L.A. in Dec. 2010. We got married that same month. \nRelated: Love on the Road: They Met on a Cruise Ship — While They Were Working \nWe didn’t waste much time in starting a family. Our son Robert was born on October 22, 2011, followed by his brother Philip on June 23, 2013. \nLauren recently got her U.S. citizenship, and we are planning to move to Holland in 2016 after we both secure jobs and I get a VISA. \nWhen I look back at how we met, the only word that comes to mind is surreal. You can’t plan a meeting like that; it’s something you only see in movies. \nI guess it was fate. \nWATCH: Taste Testing the Microbrew Beers of Greenland \nLet Yahoo Travel inspire you every day.
