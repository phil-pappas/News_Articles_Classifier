By Paul Duginski and Brady MacDonald What will Disneyland look like in 2055 on the 100th anniversary of the Anaheim theme park? What will still be around? What will be long gone by then? And what new rides and attractions will be added? As Disneyland turns 60, let’s take a wildly speculative look at what the future could hold for the original Disney park over the coming decades. Star Wars Land Festival of the Lion King Magic Carpets of Aladdin Toontown/Big Thunder Ranch/Tomorrowland Star Wars Land \nA Star Wars Land has been the topic of much speculation now that Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Darth Vader have been brought into the Disney fold. Would a Star Wars Land fit better in Toontown, Big Thunder Ranch, Tomorrowland or an Anaheim \"third gate\"? It depends on the scale and scope of the blue-sky dreams under consideration at Walt Disney Imagineering. Toontown Toy Story Land \nA Toy Story Land similar to the multi-ride themed lands recently added in Hong Kong and Paris would work great in place of Anaheim’s Toontown. Any storytelling issues involving the disconnect of Toy Story Midway Mania residing in Disney California Adventure Park and Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters living in Tomorrowland could be resolved with a little Disney pixie dust. Fantasyland Seven Dwarfs Mine Train \nThe recent expansion of Orlando’s Fantasyland introduced the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, a rethemed Goofy’s Barnstormer coaster, a dueling Dumbo ride and a \"Beauty and the Beast\" restaurant. Disneyland completely revamped Fantasyland in 1983. Is the marquee land due for another makeover? Tomorrowland Stitch Encounter \nThe most obvious piece missing from Anaheim's Tomorrowland is some version of the Stitch attraction found in Orlando, Paris and Hong Kong. Hopefully the existence of the similar Turtle Talk With Crush attraction at Disney California Adventure Park rules out the need for any of those woeful imports. Same goes for the abysmal Monsters, Inc. Laugh Floor at Disney World. Tomorrowland Stark Expo \nConsuming an astounding 7 acres, the two least futuristic attractions in Tomorrowland — Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage and Autopia — have long been rumored to be on the chopping block. Combined with the footprint of a demolished Innoventions, a major expansion could be carved out of that space. Among the possibilities: Stark Expo based on Marvel’s Iron Man franchise. Adventureland Festival of the Lion King \nIt’s stunning that Disneyland still doesn’t have a Lion King attraction. While Epcot has a “Circle of Life” movie, the spectacular “Festival of the Lion King” found at Disney’s Animal Kingdom and Hong Kong Disneyland would be a much better fit at Disneyland. But with the cramped confines of Adventureland, the show building would have to be located backstage, like the Indiana Jones Adventure. Adventureland Magic Carpets of Aladdin \nAladdin is one of the few characters that has a home at both Disneyland and Disney California Adventure Park, although thematically he fits better in Adventureland. That said, Disneyland has never really figured out what to do with the Aladdin’s Oasis space. It’s been a restaurant, a dinner theater, a meet-and-greet area and a storytelling venue. \nThe Florida, Paris and Tokyo parks have Aladdin-themed flying carpet rides that are basically Dumbo knockoffs, but the limited space in Disneyland’s Adventureland might prevent the addition of the spinning attraction. Frontierland Discovery Bay \nThe biggest untapped space in Disneyland is a 9-acre expanse in Frontierland that includes Big Thunder Ranch and the Circle D Ranch in a backstage area of the park. \nA possibility that advanced to the scale-model stage is Discovery Bay, a Jules Verne-inspired land with a steampunk theme. Various plans envisioned a blimp flight simulator, an electromagnetic coaster, a balloon ride and a submarine restaurant. Classic Disney rides \nA hundred years after the park's opening, these rides won't have gone anywhere. Fantasyland It's a Small World \nInstalled in 1966, the ride was extensively redone in 2009 to improve the building's structure and add 37 Disney characters. Fantasyland Matterhorn Bobsleds \nWhile many of the other rides in Fantasyland have counterparts at other Disney theme parks, the Matterhorn Bobsleds are one-of-a-kind. Adventureland Jungle Cruise \nAt five acres, the popular and humorous Jungle Cruise has one of the largest footprints of any attraction at Disneyland. Adventureland Haunted Mansion \nThis New Orleans Square ride isn't going anywhere, although the Mansion’s Doom Buggies could receive a ride vehicle upgrade similar to one at Hong Kong’s Mystic Manor. Adventureland Pirates of the Caribbean \nNot only has this ride spawned an entire movie franchise, it's also the last ride Walt Disney helped design. Disneyland then and now \nDisneyland opened on July 17, 1955 with only about 20 attractions. Today, the park is home to more than 60 rides and shows. Here's a look at how the landscape of Disneyland has changed in 60 years.
