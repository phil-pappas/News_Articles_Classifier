Today, the impacts of the wildly popular lodging option has grown beyond tax compliance as resort communities grapple with how these properties might be pinching the local rental housing supply and changing neighborhoods.\nA comprehensive analysis by the Colorado Association of Ski Towns, or CAST, reveals homeowners' conversion of long-term rental properties into short-term vacation rentals as the largest rental-by-owner issue for resort communities.\nVacation rentals now join the list of challenges for mountain communities that struggle to balance the demands of their tourist-dependent economies with the need to preserve a vibrant community.\nThose two forces — fostering community and feeding the tourist machine — are intertwined yet often incompatible.\nVacation rentals are part of such community- and tourist-friendly dynamics, with locals able to earn cash by renting out their properties to visitors who want to live like a local in a neighborhood house.\nAdvertisement \"This is the second-generation issue for vacation rentals,\" said Aaron \"Huck\" Huckstep, the mayor of Crested Butte, where 15 percent of all the homes are available for short-term rental and 60 percent of the town's lodging-tax revenue comes from vacation rentals. \"It's not just identifying and making sure they are tax compliant. Now we are looking at the implications of this kind of activity and how it is impacting our communities.\"\nRegulations\nCAST commissioned the report to study the role of vacation rentals in 10 communities: Breckenridge, Crested Butte, Durango, Estes Park, Frisco, Mount Crested Butte, Ouray, Steamboat Springs, Jackson, Wyo., and Park City, Utah.\nThe 52-page report is intended as a sort of manual for other communities that are developing regulations to mitigate the impact of the suddenly everywhere vacation rental market.\nWith host websites such as HomeAway.com, VRBO.com, Airbnb.com and Flipkey.com now listing more than 2 million properties, it's safe to say vacation rentals are here to stay.\nThe report looked at a variety of cities across the country and detailed the array of customized regulations and enforcement strategies used in each location. The report came out just as Santa Barbara, Calif., approved the nation's tightest restrictions , which city leaders expect will shut down about 80 percent of the upscale beach community's short-term rental properties.\nThe CAST report discourages outright bans and onerous regulations, but it says some form of regulation and enforcement is essential.\n\"They tend to proliferate wherever there's a ban — but you can try to regulate them,\" said CAST executive director Joyce Burford. \"And I think the towns that are facing the most impact in terms of losing their long-term housing supply are the ones that are going to have to enforce the toughest regulations.\"\nThe common theme for all municipalities that are grappling with vacation rentals is \"challenge.\" It's hard to identify rental properties. It's hard to craft a permitting system that will lure property owners . It's hard to track down owners and make them pay taxes. It's hard — and expensive — to enforce rules.\nAnd the websites aren't necessarily eager to help. In 2011, HomeAway threatened to sue CAST-member towns such as Winter Park and Breckenridge if city leaders did not stop searching online listings for owners who were not paying taxes. Now, the vacation rental industry has enlisted lobbying groups to help sway lawmakers to sponsor vacation rental-friendly legislation. Groups such as the industry-funded Short Term Rental Advocacy Center work to share information about the positive role of vacation rentals.\nThe websites that offer vacation rentals see sharing user information as a violation of privacy. Any effort to get information should be directed toward the property owner, not the advertising websites the owner uses, said Matt Kiessling, executive director of the Short Term Rental Advocacy Center.\n\"The person providing the goods and services is the property owner or host. These advertising platforms don't know if a property has been rented or not,\" Kiessling said.\nThe websites VRBO, HomeAway and Airbnb aren't seeing the data supporting the idea that vacation rentals are contributing to worker housing problems in resort communities, Kiessling said. (The CAST report notes how long-term rentals remain at 9 to 10 percent of Breckenridge's housing supply \"despite fluctuations due to new construction and conversion\" into vacation rentals.)\n\"Those affordable-housing problems have been around a lot longer than Airbnb or HomeAway,\" Kiessling said. \"There are a lot of reasons for affordable-housing problems, and blaming short-term rentals is not the answer.\"\nCooperation\nThe websites are showing signs of cooperation with communities. HomeAway is working with a tax outfit to help owners pay their local taxes, and Airbnb has negotiated agreements with several communities allowing for the collection of taxes, realizing, according to the report, that allowing municipalities to tax owners reduces barriers for other communities to embrace vacation rentals.\nFour of the 10 CAST communities that were studied have adjusted regulations governing short-term rentals in recent years. Breckenridge requires a full-time resident be a contact for every vacation rental. Durango, which has amended its regulations four times since 2007, separates vacation rentals to avoid clusters and has rules regarding the transfer of vacation rental permits, parking and safety standards, and the need for local property managers.\nThe CAST report lists several communities that require licenses, charge fees for permits, and vary those fees based on use and unit type. The report details strategies used in major cities — including New York, San Francisco and Portland, Ore. — that investigate vacation rentals and enforce regulations.\nRight now, members of city councils across Colorado are studying the report, possibly finding ideas that could bolster their regulation and mitigation of vacation rentals.\n\"We don't have a particular objective in mind. There is no plan to reduce or increase VRBO activity in town,\" Huckstep said. \"This is really more focusing on what is the most appropriate policy treatment here.\"\nJason Blevins: 303-954-1374, jblevins@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jasonblevins\nPercentage of housing units listed for short-term vacation rental\nBreck 41%\nCrested Butte 15%\nDurango 1%\nEstes Park 7%\nFrisco 6%\nMt Crested Butte 52%\nOuray 12%\nSource: Colorado Association of Ski Towns", "external_links": ["https://coskitowns.com/downloads/vacation-home-rentals-report/", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewbender/2015/06/15/new-regulations-to-wipe-out-80-of-airbnb-rentals-in-californias-santa-monica/"], "published": "2015-07-19T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T09:49:25.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
