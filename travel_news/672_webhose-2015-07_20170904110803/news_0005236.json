Artistic Administrator, Nora Cosgrave, Assistant Company Manager, Nicky Kehoe and Production Coordinator, Ray Bingle will be in attendance to discuss the production and answer any questions that anyone may have about participating as an ‘extra'. The information evening will last approximately one hour.\nJealousy is at the heart of Mascagni’s blood-soaked opera, Guglielmo Ratcliff, in which a young Scot, spurned by the object of his affections, challenges anyone who woos her to a duel. The rarely performed opera will be directed by Fabio Ceresa and conducted by Francesco Cillufo, both will be making their debut in Wexford. Also making his Wexford debut is Italian tenor Angelo Villari, who will sing the title role, one of the most difficult roles ever written for a tenor voice.\nArtistic Administrator with Wexford Festival Opera, Nora Cosgrave, who is coordinating the casting said, “Wexford Festival has always thrived from the participation of the Wexford community. This is another way to participate and experience this world-renowned Festival from the ‘inside’ while working with some amazing artistic talent in a professional environment. Anyone that has acted as an extra in the past has always found it to be an extremely positive experience. Anyone interested must be over 18 years of age. No singing or acting skills are necessary, but dedication and an ability to learn staging and easy choreography are required.”\nWexford Festival Opera 2015 runs from 21st October – 1st November , for more see wexfordopera.com\nMORE: National Opera House have announced their winter season and it looks great\nMORE: Wexford Festival Opera 2015 announces its full cast\nMORE: Next month at the National Opera House", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T15:39:29.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
