LUXURY SPA OPENS IN NEW YORK The high-end beauty brand La Mer is opening its first-ever worldwide spa Wednesday at the Baccarat Hotel and Residences New York in Midtown Manhattan. Called Spa de La Mer , the 1,900-square-foot space is on the hotel’s lower level, and, like the rest of the property, was designed by the Paris-based Gilles & Boissier who wanted it to be reminiscent of a European seaside retreat. The ceilings are vaulted, and the soothing colors throughout include warm champagne and bronze tones. Also, each of the four treatment rooms have a wall with a sea kelp mural that was hand-painted by the New York artists Lynda White and Jeff Wood.

ST. REGIS BOTTLES ITS OWN SCENT St. Regis Hotels & Resorts is already known as a global luxury hospitality brand. Now, the company also wants notice for the custom scent permeating the lobbies of its 34 properties. The perfumer Carlos Huber, founder of the New York-based fragrance label Arquiste, designed the smell and called it “Caroline’s Four Hundred,” after Caroline Astor, the mother of John Jacob Astor IV, who founded the St. Regis in 1904. Mrs. Astor was often thought of as the doyenne of New York’s Gilded Age society, and the four hundred in the name comes from the number of people representing the highest echelons of that circle. Mr. Huber said his creation was inspired by the grand balls Mrs. Astor held and has notes of American Beauty roses — her favorite — as well as yellow daffodils, white lilies, and apple and cherry blossoms. “There was always a profusion of flowers at these parties, and I blended them together in a crisp and fresh fragrance that stands out when guests walk in the door,” Mr. Huber said in a phone interview. “Caroline’s Four Hundred” made its debut last month and is dispersed in the lobbies through each property’s air systems. It will be available to purchase as a candle for $80 starting Sept. 15. FAMILY TRAVEL FOR OLDER CHILDREN Most organized family-friendly trips cater to travelers with younger children, but the San Francisco-based active adventure company Backroads wants to entice older teens and 20-somethings to also vacation with their parents with its new Family Breakaway itineraries. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T12:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T13:01:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
