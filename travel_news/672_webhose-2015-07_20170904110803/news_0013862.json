Claire’s Accessories returns after a brief closure during the construction period, and Superdrug, WHSmith and The Bookshop at WHSmith have moved to new, improved units in the enlarged departure lounge.\nRefreshments options include a new-look Starbucks, which has relocated to the terminal extension, and The Cabin, offering fine wine, craft beers and locally sourced food in a relaxing atmosphere, including a stylish outdoor terrace.\nOutdoor space can also be accessed by those not dining, with a rooftop garden featuring quirky sculptures expected to prove popular. Along with a second executive lounge, this will open as part of phase two within a few weeks’ time.\nThe open air terrace is not the only feature intended to make the new look departure lounge stand out from the crowd. The terminal extension has been designed to capture the essence of the South West, with finishes, colours and textures taking inspiration from the Airport’s locale. The use of timber and reeds alongside interior planting nod to the region’s natural beauty, while a striking lighting feature makes use of Bristol’s iconic blue glass to dramatic effect.\nWork has already begun on a second terminal extension, to the western end of the main building. This £24 million project will transform the security search process for passengers when it opens in summer 2016, as well as creating an enlarged baggage reclaim area, customs facilities, arrivals retail, and meet and greet area. Once completed next year, this will take the total investment in infrastructure at Bristol Airport since 2010 to over £120 million.\nRobert Sinclair, Chief Executive Officer at Bristol Airport, said:\n“More than 750,000 passengers are set to fly from Bristol Airport during July and August alone, and we are confident they will be wowed by this new extension and the space, comfort and wider choice it provides. Combined with the west terminal extension we recently announced, this development is a significant step towards achieving our vision to provide passengers from the South West and Wales with a world-class customer experience when flying in and out of their local airport.”\nOther developments also underway include improvements to car parks and the construction of a 201 room Hampton by Hilton hotel set to be completed in 2016. Beyond the Airport boundary improvements to the transport system across the West of England, including the construction of a South Bristol Link, will enhance access from the north, east and west once completed in 2016.\nEarlier this year Bristol was named the world’s most punctual Airport in a league table measuring on-time performance compiled by leading global aviation provider OAG based on more than 43 million flight records.\nSource:- Bristol Airport\nRelated Posts Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium Arrow cars secures Bristol Airport taxi contract Concur and Starbucks enable effortless expensing and rewards for travel business spend Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building MIA Director, National Counterparts Travel To Washington, D.c.
