Find our more in our city guide below.\nFor more city break inspiration, see our guide on the 10 best destinations for a long weekend and how to do it on a budget .\nCheap return flights to Fez, under £45pp Budget airlines easyJet and Monarch Airlines offer flights from various UK airports, starting from around £43 return.\nPlan more than three months ahead for good prices - if you can, opt for a mid-week break and fares fall even further.\nKeep an eye on the sales here for cut price fares all year round.

With 14 rooms, it is the Old Medina’s largest hotel and boasts all the features you would expect in a traditional riad - kaleidoscopic stained-glass windows, central courtyard, rooftop bar - as well as luxurious extras, from fine Egyptian hand-embroidered linen down to your very own pair of leather Moroccan slippers.\nRooms from £143 based on two sharing including three-course Moroccan breakfast.\nBut there is plenty of choice for riads in the old quarter. Dars - traditional houses but without the central courtyard garden - are even less, with rooms between £25 to £35 a night.\nTop TIP: Book ahead if you are going in the high season.\nBut to really save money, stay outside the Old Medina in the 'New City’. It is just a short taxi-ride away and red cabs are easy to spot.\nTripadvisor has a great price guide on the best hotels in Fez, as well as budget stays .\nOpt to stay at one of the many traditional houses known as Dars and save pounds\nTOP TIP: If you are staying in the car-free Old Medina, remember taxis can only drop you at the gates - arrange with the hotel for a guide to meet you when you arrive.\nMust see: Explore the Old Medina The Old Medina is the true wonder of Fez. Along these winding streets we discover palaces, mosques and madrassas - Arabic schools - that can all be explored at length.\nEventually, no matter which route you take, you will come face-to-face with the world-famous shopping souks.\nHere you can buy anything and everything.\nGoods on the market stalls range from the useful - hand bags, hats, scarves and blankets - to the utterly surreal - monkeys, motor bikes and massive shisha pipes that have about as much chance of getting through UK border controls as Lord Lucan.\nRest anywhere for just a short while and glasses of sweet mint tea appear along with smiling locals promising to sell you the finest bargains in all of Fez.\nFeeling adventurous? Just head in to the maze of streets, and lose yourself in the sights and smells. But for the first time, try hiring a guide.\nExperience a hammam For a short stagger to snooze afterwards, book a place to stay with its own spa. Most offer a menu of treatments and tonics, but do try traditional hammam ritual if you can.\nIt is a focal point of Moroccan culture and a weekly activity for the locals.\nBe prepared for your hair to be shampooed, steam rooms, massage - and lots and lots of scrubbing. For more information on what to expect try this guide .\nWhere to eat on a budget Fez is famed for its street food, from aubergine fritters to kebabs, honey pastries and wood-fired breads.\nFor restaurants and cafes, there is plenty of choice - from old riads to mosaic-tiled halls tucked above shops.\nAgain, Tripadvisor has good feedback on riad meals, to cafes and cheap eats.\nMust do: Take a cooking course Your hotel may offer this, or should be able to guide you.\nAt the Palais Amani , you can learn to prepare a rich chicken tagine - called dermera - infused with freshly chopped spices including saffron and coriander and featuring juicy lemon flavoured red olives, and blowtorch the skin off an aubergine for a peppery vegetable side called zaalouk.\nAn hour later you are served your own culinary feast - accompanied, if you wish, by a very agreeable bottle of Moroccan wine.\nWhen is the best time of year to travel? High season is around Christmas, New Year and Easter, and the annual sacred music festival, usually at the start of June.\nTemperatures average between 10C to 15C between November to April. They rise to hit around 20C in June, and hit a high at around 26C in August.\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Travel-g293733-c3543/Fes:Morocco:Hammams.html", "http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotels-g293733-Fes_Fes_Boulemane_Region-Hotels.html", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurants-g293733-Fes_Fes_Boulemane_Region.html", "https://twitter.com/DailyMirror", "http://www.lastminute.com/hotels/city/hotels-in-Fez-MA", "http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g293732-d481124-r166214208-Old_Medina_of_Casablanca-Casablanca_Grand_Casablanca_Region.html", "http://www.monarch.co.uk/", "http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g293733-d1742697-Reviews-Palais_Amani-Fes_Fes_Boulemane_Region.html", "http://www.easyjet.com/en/cheap-flights", "http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Tourism-g293730-Morocco-Vacations.html", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Search?q=DARS&geo=293730&pid=3826&redirect=false&type=&returnTo=http%253A__2F____2F__www__2E__tripadvisor__2E__co__2E__uk__2F__Tourism__2D__g293730__2D__Morocco__2D__Vacations__2E__html"], "published": "2015-07-20T20:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T20:00:06.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
