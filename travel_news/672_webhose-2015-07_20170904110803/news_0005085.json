A sturdy metal staircase (inset, lower right) is an easy and safe route to the beach. © Ferne Arfin \nBirling Gap, south of East Dean in East Sussex is a peaceful, scenic beach, close enough to Brighton to satisfy nudists who are disappointed by Brighton's own Black Rock Beach (which is overlooked by a busy road and rude gawkers). The only things overlooking Birling Gap are the gleaming white chalk cliffs of the Seven Sisters . In fact, if you are looking for a splendid spot to enjoy one of the best views of the iconic Seven Sisters cliffs , this is the place. \nThough not an official nude beach, it has been used by \"naturists\" for years. Birling Gap and much of the South Downs area nearby are owned by the National Trust . There is open access to both the beach and the Downs. The few walkers in the area are used to nude bathers and won’t be shocked as long as you keep to the area that has become a nude beach by common consent. It's actually hidden in a fold of the cliffs, out of site of the access stairway to the beach. \nAs nudism is unofficial here, do keep the UK's laws on public nudity and good nude beach manners in mind. Marine Conservation Society's annual Good Beach Guide 2014 Rating: Projected - Excellent. \nFrom 2014, UK beach quality is being indicated by new standards that will be published at the end of 2015. In the meantime, beach ratings are shown as \"projected\" based on an average of the previous four years. Birling Gap Nude Beach Essentials Description: A relatively narrow shingle beach beneath the South Coast's magnificent cliffs, There are some patches of sand at low tide as well as a shelf of sharp rocks that should be avoided. The water quality is good but swimming can be dangerous because of the rocks. This is a very quiet spot and visitors often have the beach to themselves. Facilities: There is an inexpensive, pay and display National Trust parking lot as well as a café and toilets in the National Trust visitor center, once the Birling Gap Hotel. Warnings: Rocks have been known to fall off the face of the cliffs so try to avoid the falling rock zone when choosing your spot. A patch of very sharp rocks makes getting in and out of the water difficult. Best times are at high tide, when the rocks are well below the surface, or low tide, when they are exposed to view. Getting there: Birling Gap is on the south coast, off the A259 between Eastbourne and Seaford. At the village of Eastdean, turn south following signs to 'Went Hill' and 'Birling Gap'. Birling Gap was once a village with a small hotel. But the cliffs at this point are eroding and falling into the sea at a rate of about 3ft a year. All that's left is a short terrace of cottages, some of which have already fallen into the sea. At the shore, reach the beach by an enclosed metal staircase next to the National Trust visitors center. If you see any clothed bathers on this beach, they will be near these stairs. Turn right at the bottom of the stairs and walk about 500 yards to the start of the nude bathing area. The further along you walk in this direction, the quieter and more deserted the beach will be.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T20:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T01:20:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
