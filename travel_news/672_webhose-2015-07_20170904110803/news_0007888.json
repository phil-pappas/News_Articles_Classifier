It’s summer and you know you want to go somewhere. But you can’t decide just when is the best time to get the lowest fares. Experts from Airfarewatchdog.com and AirFastTickets.com are here to help with their best fare-buying tips.\nGeorge Hobica of Airfarewatchdog offered his first tip, which was a surprise to me: There's no \"magic\" day or lead time to buy the best airfare. “A lot of airfare experts think they're clairvoyant, so they know where airfares are headed or how far in advance you should start looking for a fare.\nThe latest myth is to buy exactly 54 days in advance. Others say buy on Tuesday at 3 p.m. or Wednesday at midnight or when the moon is full (just kidding),” he writes. “But airlines are unpredictable, and anyone who claims he or she knows that airfares will be lower or higher in the coming months or the coming days should trade in their crystal ball. No one can accurately predict where airfares are heading, any more than we can predict the stock market.”\nThis leads to his next tip: Search often, over a long lead time, and pounce when there's a deal. “Fares fluctuate throughout the day, and the number of seats offered at the lowest fares also changes frequently. Or someone might be holding the only seat at the lowest fare and not book it, so it goes back into inventory—and then it will be yours,” writes Hobica. “So if you don't like the fare at 10 a.m., check at 2 p.m. or the next day or the next week and pounce when the fare is affordable. It's easy to leave open the browser page where you're searching for a fare and keep on hitting the refresh.”\nHobica’s last tip is to sign up for airfare alerts by email. “This is perhaps the easiest way to track airfares. Many travel web sites offer emailed airfare alerts, letting you know when fares go down, and they all have something to offer,” he writes. “Do a browser search for \"airfare alerts\" and you'll see what's available. They all work a bit differently so sign up for more than one.” I am a big fan of Airfarewatchdog's free alerts, and suggest that you sign up here .\nAirFastTickets.com is an online booking service that claims to offers the lowest rates on flights, cruises, hotels, vacation packages and car rentals. And they have a different take on Hobica’s advice, also with some surprises. Their tips include:\nBook international flights 55 days prior to departure Book domestic flights 25 or 28 days prior to departure Never book on a Tuesday as everyone does and flights can be the priciest. If you need to book on a Tuesday, do it early in the morning before 9am. Generally the best days and times to book are either Saturday or Sunday early in the morning (before 9am) For the best service and additional benefits on board, bring chocolate for the crew (everyone expects them to take care of them but nobody does the other way around - sometimes even the pilot comes for a personal thank you) On average, prices change 5 times a week for a single air ticket by airlines. If you can, give yourself flexible days for traveling. For international flights, fly with the carrier of the local destination (i.e. Aegean Airlines to Greece or Lufthansa to Germany) because they will have more inventory/seats which translates to lower prices or rates.\nGood luck with your fare searches, and have a great summer vacation!", "external_links": ["http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/W/9/I/hdpln.jpg", "http://www.airfarewatchdog.com/fare-alerts/", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/9/I/hdpln.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T07:17:07.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
