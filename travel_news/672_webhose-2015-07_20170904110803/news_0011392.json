Adv: \nJul 05, 2015 Adv: \nLOT Polish Airlines last month was forced to cancel 10 flights and delay 12 others in response to an attack against computers issuing flight plans at Warsaw's Okecie Airport that overloaded its network. That came a few weeks after United Airlines had grounded all its flights in the US, reportedly after bogus flight plans appeared in its system. \nMalaysia Airlines is still missing a plane. \nIn May, a US Federal Bureau of Investigation affidavit claimed American security researcher Chris Roberts had hacked into aircraft systems through the in-flight entertainment system, causing the plane to drift sideways in flight. \nThis has yet to be verified but it has raised significant concerns in the security and insurance industry circles. \nAirlines are increasingly at risk of cyber attacks that could pose significant safety issues and force carriers to ground their fleets to protect passenger welfare, causing major financial damage , security experts say. \nAirline experts recommend for airlines to buy insurance plans covering cyber attacks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T09:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T14:26:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
