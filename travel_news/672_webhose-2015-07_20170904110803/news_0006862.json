Adorned with gleaming cupolas, ornate architecture and myriad museums, Russia’s capital is one of the most beautiful places to visit, yet also one of the most complex.\nShaky headlines have not deterred the stoic city, home to 12 million residents, from pressing forward with steady vigour. In June, the Garage Museum of Contemporary Art opened in its new Rem Koolhaas-designed space; and Four Seasons Hotel Moscow recently added glitz to the skyline.\nIn town for three days? Navigate the metropolis by focusing on a few neighbourhoods. No matter when you go – for the long days of summer, October’s Kremlin Cup tennis, or Moscow Fashion Week in November – the city will leave an indelible impression.\n The Mayakovskaya metro station in Moscow is one of the largest underground metro system in the world. Picure: Sefa Karacan/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Source: Getty Images\nDAY ONE\nBegin your journey at Red Square, the heart of Moscow, the cobbled expanse of which tells a storied history of razes, revolutionary gatherings and the recent Victory Parade, held to commemorate 70 years since the defeat of Nazi Germany. The reconstructed Resurrection Gate (the 17th-century original was demolished under Communism) frames a sweeping view bordered by the crimson Kremlin; candy-coloured cupolas of St Basil’s Cathedral; and 1890-built GUM – the former State Department Store is now an upscale arcade filled with designer brands and dining spots including touristy Bosco Cafe (great views), and Stolovaya No. 57, which serves Soviet-era cuisine like pelmeni (dumplings), piroshki (handheld pies) and hearty borscht in a cafeteria-like setting.\nDedicate the rest of the day to the 14th-century Kremlin. Tour the Armoury’s collection of Faberge eggs; see the superb Orlov Diamond, a gift to Catherine the Great by her lover, Count Grogory Orlov; visit Terem Palace, home to tsars and the Romanovs; or discover the enduring 1326-built Cathedral of the Assumption, with an interior sheathed in frescoes. When night falls, Red Square and the surrounding buildings are brilliantly illuminated. Splurge at the new Four Seasons Hotel Moscow – the views from Moscovsky Bar are so close, you could touch them.\n The Garage Museum of Contemporary Art in Gorky Park.

The historic Hotel National offers a traditional buffet of blini (crepes), caviar, cold cuts and pastries. Meanwhile, the top-rated Lotte Hotel serves a multicultural spread from Asian dumplings to chef-made omelets to a detox bar with wellness smoothies.\nMoscow’s metro, an artistic showcase in itself, is the best way to get around a town known for its gridlock. Head to Oktyabrskaya station and walk a short way to leafy Gorky Park, resplendent with fountains, gardens, and “beach” volleyball courts. It’s also the location of the Garage Museum of Contemporary Art, which just relocated to its new two-storey 5400sq m home designed by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas. Run by Daria Zhukova, wife of Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, the museum will present the first Louise Bourgeois retrospective in Russia, co-organised with Munich’s Haus der Kunst, in September.\nA walk along the Moscow River leads to the New Tretyakov Gallery, situated in the Central House of Artists – a Soviet-era landmark built for the 1980 Moscow Olympics. The collection of 20th-century works by Kandinsky, Chagall, Russian Impressionists and Soviet painters is exceptional.

Muscovites love Georgian food and Mizandari Cafe makes excellent khachapuri, an airy flatbread served warm from the oven and filled with tangy sulguni cheese.\nAround the corner, the Lumiere Brothers Center for Photography, housed in the former manual confectionery packing area, stages excellent exhibitions curated from its collection of photo acquisitions. There’s a well-stocked bookstore on-site, too.\nNavigate the factory’s trove of alleyways until you reach Bontempi, an Italian restaurant named for its lively owner, expat Valentino Bontempi. Locals and Russian celebrities including designer Valentin Yudashkin dine on the restaurant’s rooftop while overlooking the magnificent five-gold-domed Christ the Saviour Cathedral, opened in 2000 as a replica of the 19th-century original. Take advantage of the long summer nights with after-dinner drinks on the terrace of Cafe Kanzler at Hotel Baltschug Kempinski, just a 20-minute walk along the riverfront. Enjoy cocktails with a backdrop of St Basil’s Cathedral before strolling over Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge to the Red Square, when you’ll have the cobblestones practically to yourself.\n The Bolshoi Theatre was designed by architect Joseph Bove for ballet and opera performances and it was started to be built in 1824. Picture: Sefa Karacan/Anadolu Ajans/Getty Images Source: Getty Images\nDAY THREE\nStart the morning backstage at the iconic Bolshoi Theatre, fresh from a multimillion-dollar, six-year renovation. If you’re lucky, you’ll glimpse a ballet rehearsal for that evening’s performance, which – if you can score tickets – should not be missed.\nTravel from Teatralnaya metro station to Smolenskaya, where the Old Arbat begins. This pedestrian walkway was once the doorstep of Moscow’s creative community; today, it is lined with souvenir stores, book stalls, sketching artists, and outposts of US dining chains such as Shake Shack and Le Pain Quotidien bakery.\nPop into Smolensky Gastronom to see the abundant display of smoked fish, caviar, cheeses and baked savoury treats before continuing to the blue-painted Pushkin House Museum, where the great writer/poet Alexander Pushkin lived with his young wife Natalia in 1831. You’ll see portraits of the author’s social circle, his original desk, love letters to his wife and the home’s interior. The museum shop by the ticket office has a good selection of souvenirs.\nAt the intersection of Old and New Arbat, on Nikitsky Bulvar, stands the downcast statue of writer Nikolai Gogol. Fans of his short stories ( The Overcoat, The Nose and Inspector General ) may be interested in visiting the adjacent home-museum where Gogol spent his final years, though the exhibition is in Russian. Further along, on Bolshaya Nikitskaya, architecture buffs must seek out Maxim Gorky’s former home/writer’s club, gifted to him by Stalin. Designed in 1901 by Fyodor Schechtel and decorated with orchid friezes, stained glass windows, and floral mouldings, it’s a beautiful example of Russian Art Nouveau. Unlike most museums, entry is free. That said, photography is allowed at a charge (a standard practice in Russia).\nTop off the cultural immersion with dinner at Cafe Pushkin, located off famous Tverskoy Boulevard. The restaurant’s aristocratic townhome setting, old-world service and Russian menu calls for caviar with blini. When in Moscow, do as Muscovites do and raise a shot glass of vodka while exclaiming Na Zdorovye!, the Russian salutation for cheers.\n Hotel National in Moscow, Russia.

Interiors retain their traditional look; request a room with a Kremlin view. See national.ru\nThe award-winning Lotte Hotel is located by the Old Arbat, a15-minute metro ride from the Red Square. Expect modern finishes, technologically advanced rooms, and a well-heeled crowd. The below-ground Mandara Spa and pool are popular with guests and the fashion set. See lottehotel.com/moscow/ru\nSwissotel Krasnye Holmy Moscow is about 3km from the Kremlin, in an up-and-coming neighbourhood, a short walk from Paveletskaya metro station. Ask for a city-facing room on a high floor; otherwise, head to the City Space Bar on the 34th floor for 360-degree views. See swissotel.com/hotels/moscow\nGETTING AROUND\nMoscow is a walking city and has an efficient metro, which is always busy and heavily reliant on stairs and escalators (there are rarely elevators to assist the elderly and travellers with luggage). Trolley buses run frequently. Metro passes are available. Taxis and private cars can be pricey and subject to lengthy traffic jams.\nTOURS\nRussian Gateway Tours in Sydney specialises in visa support, flights, cruises and accommodation for Russia.
