All Leisure is also suffering from the conflict in Ukraine, which is affecting cruising in the profitable Black sea area. \nCoupled with problems in its destinations, the Aim-listed firm is also suffering from foreign currency transaction losses. \nRoger Allard, executive chairman of All Leisure, said: “I am pleased to report that the seasonal losses for the first half year have been reduced, despite the dry-dock periods for both Voyager and Minerva, which reduced available sailing time.” \nBut he added: “With the company continuing to experience these difficult trading conditions, the board anticipates that full-year performance will be below expectations and now expects the business to make a small loss for the full year.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T11:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T13:55:02.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
