While children may have been eagerly awaiting the holidays, the survey revealed only one in five mums and dads similarly look forward to the challenge.\nThere is a silver lining during the period however, with one in six saying they enjoyed holidays because it meant they didn't have to embark on the school run every morning and a similar number said mornings were far less stressful in general.\nAndrew Robertson, from Family & Friends Railcard said: 'The school holidays are a fantastic time for families to spend quality time together, but all too often, whether through lack of ideas or available funds, parents can be left wondering what to do with the kids to keep them entertained over the summer break.\nWhile children may have been eagerly awaiting the holidays, it was revealed that only one in five mums and dads similarly look forward to the challenge\n'Our latest research shows that this tends to happen very early into the holidays, with the majority of parents running out of things to do to amuse the kids three weeks into the holiday.'\nThe study also found that one in ten admitted they like the holidays because they can lie-in rather than get up early.\nAs little as just six per cent said they managed to fill the entire holidays with exciting activities.\nAround three quarters of those who took part said there came a point when the money ran out with 28 days into the holidays emerging as the average.\nThe Alice in Wonderland Garden Trail at Hyde Hall in Essex is one of the events put on at the venue to entertain children during the holidays\nWhen asked to pick words to describe the holidays 39 per cent picked 'hard work', 34 per cent said they were 'rewarding', 32 per cent said they were 'tiring' and 31 per cent said they were 'exhausting'.\nForty five per cent of parents look forward to the children returning to school after the summer holidays.\nThe 'cup half full' brigade chose 'relaxing' (28 per cent), 'fun-packed' (28 per cent) and 14 per cent even hailed them as 'amazing'.\nThirty-seven per cent of parents admitted they rely on grandparents to help out.\nAnd five per cent revealed their other half didn't take time off to help out because they'd rather be at work.\nAs little as just six per cent of surveyed adults said they managed to fill the entire holidays with exciting activities", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1SQJKKf"], "published": "2015-07-31T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T15:56:35.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
