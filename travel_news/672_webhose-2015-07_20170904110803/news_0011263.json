Details   14:45 London Gatwick passengers can now travel without their luggage to and from the airport with AirPortre Portr and London Gatwick have announced that the London-based travel tech start-up, have launched their AirPortr luggage transfer service at the airport. Gatwick passengers can now take advantage of the same-day, on demand luggage service which provides bag-free travel to and from their home, workplace or holiday destination within London, Gatwick and surrounding/ connecting London corridor*. \nAirPortr’s team of concierges and drivers collect and deliver passengers’ often-burdensome baggage between their location and the airport, within hours, at a time suited to them. Passengers can now travel bag-free, resulting in quicker, lighter and stress free journeys. Departing travellers with an afternoon or evening flight can be free to make the most of their departure day, leaving it later before making the journey to the airport as they no longer have to factor in extra time carrying their heavy luggage. Arriving passengers offload their bags with the AirPortr team when they land and travel straight to their destination, avoiding carrying luggage around with them all day. AirPortr’s service is priced deliberately as an ‘affordable luxury’. For example, two bags whatever their size or weight delivered to or from the airport into Central London costs only £30. The luggage delivery service can be booked in advance or on the day of travel (www.portr.com). Chris Walsh, Head of Customer Experience at Portr, said: “Since launching the AirPortr experience we have overwhelmingly seen how the service literally changes the way people now plan and make their journeys. Of course we are in the business of same day luggage delivery and ensuring your bags travel when and where you want them, but really AirPortr is all about the time and convenience aspect of the service that we in reality aspire to deliver. More time to do what you want and need to do versus having your luggage inconveniently dictating your itinerary i.e. what we like to think is truly travelling with ‘Luggage Freedom’.” Toby Tait, Product Manager – Premium and Business Services, said: “Gatwick is always striving to make our passengers’ travel through our airport quick, convenient and hassle-free. The arrival of AirPortr now means that the convenience our passengers experience at the airport extends to their travel to and from Gatwick. Carrying heavy bags on the journey to and from the airport can now be a thing of the past for our passengers.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T18:10:05.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
