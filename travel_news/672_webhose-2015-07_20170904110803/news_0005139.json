Some of that success may be due to how well the site engages young children without reducing the overall experience for adults. It’s a delicate balance, truly tested when my wife and I bowled up with our two young boys in tow.\nBringing old buildings to life for digital natives is an ambitious task but Port Arthur is more than equipped for the challenge.\nUpon entry each visitor is given a playing card that you then match with the recorded history of a real convict in the downstairs museum. As you follow the life journey of your alter ego, the penal system becomes tangible and alive.\nIn the “Lottery of Life” my wife became pickpocket William White. My youngest drew Walter Paisley, a teller of rude stories who went on to become a maker of fine rowing boats. Most aptly, my eldest was dealt George Hunt, a notorious rascal who took on the system, suffered the consequences and refused to learn from them. Big4 Port Arthur Holiday Park.

While punishments were unduly harsh the intention was to reform repeat offenders into literate and capable citizens. Port Arthur offered a stark choice, highlighted today inside the museum. “Cheerful, contented, cleanly and obedient” prisoners are invited in one direction while “sullen, cunning, dirty, disobedient and idle prisoners” are ushered into a darkened room lined with shackles.\nEntry passes into the site include a guided tour of the major buildings after which you’re free to explore the expansive settlement at your leisure. I was concerned my kids might find it all a bit grim but as enthusiasts of the British TV show Horrible Histories they were well prepared for stories of cruel and unusual deprivation.\nLater we joined a boat tour that took us out past the Isle of the Dead cemetery to Point Puer, home of the British Empire’s first juvenile reformatory. About 3000 boys, some as young as nine, were sent here to work, learn and obey. Life was tough and the dinner menu – “bread, junk and duff” – most unappealing. As my kids flung back hot chocolates and raced off to the foredeck, I wondered how any of those poor lads could have ever been cheerful.\nMy eldest had such a good time he haggled for a return visit to attend the nightly ghost tour, which he repeatedly assured me would be awesome. I wasn’t as certain but nine-year-olds and chance encounters with the undead are not easily parted.\nIt was a cold dark night when we returned to the Port Arthur visitors centre, rugged up in snow jackets. Dozens of tourists milled around speculating about the hour-and-a-half ahead. Our guide wore an Akubra and resembled former Nationals Leader Tim Fischer. He led us across the dark grounds to the church, a gothic construction, “born in blood and burnt down in fire”. Under the glow of a lantern he recounted the pick axe murder of Joseph Shuttleworth and my skin crawled. Family Fun Activities at Port Arthur. Interpretative Centre.

Some are lifted from the historical record and give a deeper insight into the fascinating settlement. Others concern unexplainable and most unpleasant happenings. Apparently, hauntings were noted at least as far back as 1870 with the death and subsequent return of the Reverend George Eastman. Many more unaccountable sounds, smells and crushing black depressions have crept up on people since.\nOf course I didn’t believe a word of it but at our next stop, a low-roofed dungeon housing a cold slab used for dissecting convict bodies, I felt more than just claustrophobic. All those Stephen King books I devoured as a teenager were creaking back into life.\nIn our group’s hasty retreat from the dungeon I lost track of my son. When he found me his eyes were as wide as mine and I wondered if a ghost tour was such a great idea for a nine-year-old. But he wasn’t scared, just thrilled. Our Tasmanian adventure moved on the next day but nothing excited my son as thoroughly as the Port Arthur Ghost Tour.\nGO2\nPORT ARTHUR\nGETTING THERE\nQantas, Virgin Australia, Jetstar and Tiger Air fly to Hobart.
