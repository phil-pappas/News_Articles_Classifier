The iconic building, which was built in 1525 by Cardinal Wolsey, Henry VIII’s Chancellor, was the inspiration for the Hogwarts’ dining room in the Harry Potter films. \nThe building was closed over the past 9 months after the roof was found to have death watch beetle and structural issues, which had developed over the last half century. A team of specialist craftsmen led by Cliveden Conservation has carried out a programme of significant works to the Tudor timber and the roof is now resplendently repaired. Martyn Percy, Dean of Christ Church said: “I am delighted that Hall’s magnificent roof has been repaired with such care and attention. We look forward to welcoming students, staff and visitors back into this outstanding example of Tudor architectural genius.” Christ Church is a member of Conference Oxford and the Great Hall is an important part of the conference facilities available in Oxford. In September 2015 the Great Hall will host the flagship conference dinner of the 63rd International Congress of Aviation and Space Medicine (ICASM). The college has also recently completed extensive developments to the Lodge and Undercroft (cellar bar) which can be utilised by conferences and events. The spectacular new Undercroft Bar can accommodate up to 100 people, with flexible mood lighting that can be tailored to the corporate colours of the event organiser. Conference Oxford offers a free venue finding service, providing the easiest, quickest and best value way of arranging an event at the University of Oxford. It offers a one-stop-shop for conference and event bookings and also help and advice to those organising large conferences using more than one University venue.
