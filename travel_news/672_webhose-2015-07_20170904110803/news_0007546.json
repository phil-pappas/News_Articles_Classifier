That's exactly why Metropol Parasol is so controversial and still creates so much debate around the world. \nThe design was the winning entry by Germany's J Mayer H Architects in an international competition to provide a solution to redevelop the Plaza de la Encarnacion - replacing a parking area and bus station while also protecting Roman and Moorish ruins beneath the surface - and to put Seville on the modern- architecture map. \nIt aims to create \"a unique urban space within the dense fabric of the medieval inner city of Seville\", as the architects describe the project on their website. \nWork began on June26, 2005, and due to various delays and difficulties, didn't open until May, 2011 - nearly four years past its projected completion date and reportedly costing well in excess of €100million. Photos View Photo Gallery \nThe six mushroom-like \"parasols\" are made of bonded timber beams with a polyurethane coating that criss-cross in a waffle-like weave to create the space-age-looking canopy. \nCovering 150m by 70m in total, the parasols link together for the world's largest glued structure: a massive shaded area offering welcome protection from both the harsh Andalusian sun and inclement weather. \nWhile the enormity of the public space is best viewed from above or in aerial photographs, visitors definitely feel like ants under a rubber-tree plant while sitting on a public bench, gazing upwards. \nMetropol Parasol isn't just an unusual pretty face, though. \nIt houses the Antiquarium archaeological museum in the basement, the farmers' market (Mercado de la Encarnacion), bars and restaurants and an open-air concert area, as well as 360-degree views over the walled city from 30m above ground at a large mirador (viewing terrace) at the top of the structure. \nThe jury is still out on whether Las Setas (\"the Mushrooms\", as it is known locally) is a winner for me. Big. Impressive. Unusual. \nNot distinctly Spanish. Out of place where it is. Certainly a talking point. But I couldn't help feeling like a giant had sat down one day with a meccano set and this is the end result. \nSiesta time was perhaps not the best time to visit as I wondered if the expanse was ever abuzz with music, dancing and laughter - a true meeting place for residents and tourists alike, no doubt as the architects intended. \nAt that time of day, all I could see was a virtual emptiness ... underneath a massive white elephant. Give me old-town Andalusian charm any day, but Metropol Parasol is certainly worth a visit to make up your own mind. \nTOP SUNSHINE COAST STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T02:23:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
