Both were alleged to have disobeyed requests to stop using foul and explicit language and consuming their own alcohol. In addition, their seats were seen to have been damaged, leading to a 30 minute delay to Jet2.com’s return flight to Newcastle Airport.\nThe airline has since banned both from travelling with Jet2.com and Jet2holidays for 12 months. It has also handed details over to Northumbria Police, seeking costs for the damage incurred to the aircraft.\nPhil Ward, managing director of Jet2.com said: “This incident highlights why it is important to take a stance on antisocial conduct. Such disruptive behaviour is simply not tolerated under our Onboard Together programme which empowers our crew to use numerous measures to stamp it out, including issuing verbal and written warnings and, in this case, alerting the authorities.\n“This is a growing problem which needs to be tackled by the industry as a whole. Passengers and crew should not have to put up with such offensive and unnecessary disruption and airlines should certainly not have to deal with aircraft damage.”\nSource:-Jet2.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T04:15:30.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
