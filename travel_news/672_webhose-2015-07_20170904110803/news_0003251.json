There's a list of those over here just in case you haven't made your own list. \nBut - in the words of those tacky, late-night TV commercials - Wait! There's More! You won't find any extra seeds for your chia pet in this list, but don't let that stop you from reading on. \nWhat you will find here are some really fun things to do in San Diego that you may not know about. I'm guessing that an adventurous person like you of may even want to do a few, now that you know about them. \nIf you want to know where they all are, use this handy map . Chill Out at Mission Bay : San Diego has some of the nicest public parks in the state, and this one is the best of the bunch. It's a huge park, surrounded by water where your biggest worry may be figuring out which part of it is just perfect for you. It's also a good place to get a glimpse of what it's like to actually live in San Diego. Seaside Amusements at Belmont Park : One of California's few surviving seaside amusement parks, it has a wooden rollercoaster and a small boardwalk. Take a Brewery Tours : San Diego's microbrewery scene continues to expand, but sampling too many brews on your own can be just plain dangerous. This guided tour is a safe, fun way to sample some of San Diego's best micro-brewed beers. Mine Your Own Gems : You may not strike it rich, but you can mine your own tourmaline, purple kunzite and pinky-peach-colored morganite gemstones at this unusual spot. The mine is about an hour's drive north of downtown San Diego. Visit a Camel Dairy : No, you didn't mis-read that. At Oasis Camel Dairy, you can feed a camel, ride one and at the spring, check out their adorable babies. It's about an hour's drive northeast of downtown - and on the way there, you can stop in the town of Julian for a piece of their famous apple pie. Explore One of San Diego's Arts Districts : Check out Barrio Logan's young artists and designers or enjoy art galleries, interesting food and fashionable boutiques in the North and South Park. Or try one of the other seven districts. Seasonal Things to Do Whale Watching : December through March is migration season along the San Diego coast, when mother gray whales and their babies travel north to their feeding grounds. Daily trips take you out to see them. Carlsbad Flower Fields : At this commercial flower-growing operation, thousands of colorful acres are in bloom every March. Horse Racing at Del Mar : One of the trendiest and busiest race tracks in the country - and there's a lot to do there even if you don't care for the sport.
