Don't miss the chance to see the Bayeux Tapestry if you're in the area.\" \nTravel tips: \"Renting a car allows you to maximize your time to enjoy what there is to see. Having a smartphone to access Google maps is very useful.\" Courtesy of the Ross Family SOUTH AFRICA: The Ross family is just back from South Africa, where Sunnyvale resident Aaron Ross, left; Annapolis, Maryland, resident Carl Smit; and Santa Cruz s Mike Holt attending the opening ceremony of the 2015 5O5 World Championship Regatta in Port Elizabeth.

Mike was also the 2014 champion. This was the fleet's 60th anniversary.
