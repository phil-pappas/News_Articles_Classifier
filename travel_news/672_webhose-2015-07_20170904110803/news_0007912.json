This teeny tiny picturesque Caribbean island is insanely crowded. It’s just .012 square kilometres, but somehow 1200 people manage to inhabit it, making it four times as densely populated as Manhattan.\nLocated in the archipelago of San Bernardo, it lies two hours from Cartagena, Colombia. According to local legend, it was discovered about 150 years ago by a group of passing fishermen from the coastal town of Baru, 50 kilometres away.\nThey found something very attractive about the island — it had no mosquitoes, a rarity in the area. So they set up camp.\nIt’s arguably the most densely populated island on Earth. Source: Picture Media\nThese days, there are 90 houses, two shops, one restaurant and a school. Space is so limited that many of the structures extend onto the water, and the isle is part artificial.\nAnd with no high-rises, everyone is squished onto the ground level.\nThe only empty space for people to visit is a courtyard which is half the size of a tennis court.\nLife is actually quite relaxing, although cramped. Source: Supplied\nMost of its residents work on nearby islands, and life here is described as peaceful, with children well-behaved and doors never locked.\n“Life here is calm and delightful,” says 66-year-old Juvenal Julio, a descendant of the Islote’s founders, told the Toronto Star . “We don’t have violence, we don’t need police, we all know each other and we enjoy our days.”\nStunning. Picture: A TripAdvisor traveller Source: Supplied\nDespite the lack of crime, there is a lone security guard. He’s stationed there because Colombia funds a school on the island which is attended by 80 children, and law states that there must be a guard for every school.\nNot that they need it, with children described as “docile” by their teachers.\nWhen death strikes, the bodies are taken to a neighbouring island for burial, as there’s no room for a cemetery.\nBut despite the squeeze, locals love the lifestyle, with one telling the Star “It’s a glorious life.”\nOriginally published as Life in the most crowded place on Earth", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/22/1227452/353523-3db1bd92-3009-11e5-b2ad-9354971dde2c.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/22/1227452/352428-eca12fdc-2f54-11e5-b867-298658792706.jpg", "http://www.thestar.com/news/world/2013/01/05/how_people_live_on_the_most_crowded_island_on_earth.html", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/22/1227452/352361-3d3a7026-2f36-11e5-b867-298658792706.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-ideas/life-in-the-most-crowded-place-on-earth/story-e6frfqd9-1227452353659"], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:18:36.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
