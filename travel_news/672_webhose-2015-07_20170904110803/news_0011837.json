This photo is of my wife, Marie, taken at Bow Lake, halfway between Banff and Jasper. During our stay in Canada, this weather was fairly standard - clear, crisp days, with no clouds or wind. The Rockies themselves just go on and on. Turn another corner, another snow-capped mountain range. Amazing. \nWhile on holiday in the Yucatan region in Mexico, my husband Ray never wasted an opportunity to have fun. In overwhelming heat and humidity, he brings action to a pillar at Chichen Itza - the most famous and amazing Mayan site. \nI took this photo of myself in San Pedro de Atacama in Northern Chile. The area is called Valle De La Luna, which translates to Valley of the Moon. The photo was taken shortly before the sunset of the full moon. \nI spotted these colourful umbrellas while shopping at the Temple Street night market in Hong Kong. \nWe took a desert safari out into the dunes an hour outside of Dubai in a 4WD with partially deflated tyres. This photo is of fellow tourists as we paused to watch the sunset, which featured a rich golden glow from the desert dust particles. \nThis image shows the view from the summit of Mt Rinjani, Lombok, Indonesia. The 3700m summit was reached at 6am after a day and a half of climbing. The view shows not only the beautiful volcanic crater and ridge line but also the incredible steepness of the mountain. The ocean view in the distance shows how quickly 3700m vertical can rise from sea level. The small colored dots on the ridge below are the tents we slept in briefly and the specks on the ridge line are fellow hikers slowly finishing their ascent. \nMy husband drives the canal boat as we traverse the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct in Wales. The aqueduct is 38 metres above the ground, and over 200 years old. It was a great experience. \nI spotted this shop assistant having a quiet moment checking her mobile in Hoi Ann, Vietnam. The green lanterns, yellow wall and the window frame all formed a perfect picture. \nMy friend took this photo of me whilst I was walking through a small village in Senga Bay, Malawi. \nThis view is from a beach bar near Estepona, Spain, looking out over the beach and sea to the mountains of north Africa. 1 of 10 \nThis week's travel photo entries take us from the Canadian Rockies to a sunset in Spain. \nDo you have a holiday snap that you'd like to share with the world? \nSend it to us and be in to win a Panasonic camera!
