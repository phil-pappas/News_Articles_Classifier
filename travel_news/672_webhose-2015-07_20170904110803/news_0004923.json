Photograph by: Patricia Maunder , Postmedia News \nThe Lost City of the Incas was never truly forgotten. Local farmers knew about it all along, but as far as the rest of the planet is concerned, the day they showed Machu Picchu to Yale academic Hiram Bingham in 1911 was the day these spectacular ruins high in the Andes were discovered. \nSince then, Machu Picchu has been quite the opposite of lost, particularly after it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, and an Internet poll placed it among the New Seven Wonders of the World 25 years later. \nSo here I stand, one of thousands ticking Machu Picchu offthe bucket list today, one of hundreds of thousands this year. Standing in awe, because that iconic view captured in countless photographs is now before my eyes: centuries-old stone ruins surrounded by clouds and mountain peaks, including the iconic pyramidal backdrop of Wayna Picchu. \nIt’s a majestic juxtaposition of nature and human endeavour that exceeds expectations, especially when I descend into this 15th-century city and explore its myriad spaces and structures. \nEverything that remains standing today was made using the dry-stone technique, including the perfectly planed and aligned blocks of temple walls, which harmoniously merge with the mountain’s natural stone. The site’s most important temple is dedicated to the sun, which shines precisely through a window on the summer solstice. \nAmong Machu Picchu’s other highlights are a large open space with bright acoustics that was used for ceremonies, a rock carved to point exactly north, and terraces, where crops once grew, cascading down the mountainside. The sight that seems to enthrall visitors most, however, are the grazing llamas. \nThis city in the clouds exceeds expectations, yet so does much of Peru . Like many visitors, I’m drawn here by Machu Picchu, but arrive with limited knowledge of what else this remarkable land offers. I am almost constantly intrigued, even surprised, on this journey of discovery. \nNot least among the surprises are just how many Incan structures, large and small, are along the ancient mountain “highway” now known as the Inca Trail. It’s a challenging four-day hike, peaking at 4,200 metres above sea level, so when I stumble upon these isolated ruins there are only a few fellow travellers about, rather than the crowds of Machu Picchu. \nI am further rewarded along this 43-kilometre mountain trail by Mother Nature, or Pachamama as she is known here. I encounter hummingbirds, wild orchids and lush rainforest valleys that give way to jagged, snow-capped mountain vistas. At times, I’m literally walking among the clouds, which drift and swirl around the endless peaks, while at night, Southern Hemisphere stars shine bright over our little group’s campsite. \nMy personal discovery of Machu Picchu complete, at least for now, I head to Cuzco to explore what was the Incan Empire’s capital and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The city is a fascinating dialogue between Incan and Spanish cultures of old, its modern inhabitants and the tourists who descend on their way to and from Machu Picchu. \nA golden statue of Emperor Pachacutec surveys the central Plaza de Armas , which is surrounded by grand Spanish colonial churches stuffed with gold, silver, mirrors, statues and paintings in high Baroque style – and a hint of indigenous influence. \nThe cathedral’s 18th-century painting of Jesus’s Last Supper, for example, depicts an unlikely repast of traditional Andean fare, including a roasted chinchilla. Some argue that it’s a guinea pig, a local delicacy that restaurants offer in the same style, head and legs intact, to tourists with a sense of culinary adventure. \nSome of Cuzco’s Incan walls remain as the foundations of colonial-era buildings. The most notable example is Santo Domingo monastery, which was built over a major sun temple called Qorikancha, preserving several walls of finely finished stone in the process. The workmanship is extraordinary, especially considering the Incas had no iron tools. \nEverywhere, indigenous women catch my eye with their distinctive clothes that merge Spanish and Andean design, as they pose for photos with their llamas or sell handwoven shawls and knitted hats. \nThere’s no need for such garments on the next leg of my journey. After a short flight across the Andes, I’m in the midst of something Peru is not well known for, but which makes up some 60 per cent of its land mass: the Amazon Basin. \nThe two-hour journey along the Tambopata River to Cayman Lodge gives me time to adjust to sticky jungle conditions after several days in the cool mountains. There’s also the chance to watch wildlife on and by the water: turtles, various birds, the small crocodile species called caiman, and capybara, a large, snub-nosed rodent. \nThat night, after watching a kaleidoscopic sunset from the riverside deck, we head into the Tambopata-Candomo Reserve that surrounds Cayman Lodge . Our guide, Joel, is armed with a machete and flashlight, with which he points out a shy sloth high in the trees even before we leave the property. \nThe machete is primarily a weapon, as one of the more dangerous animals lurking in the jungle, such as a puma, may approach. Small critters can be dangerous, too, though, and Joel warns us more than once: “Don’t touch anything!” Easy advice to follow when his flashlight reveals a massive, hairy tarantula. \nDuring other expeditions into the jungle and onto the river, we are surrounded by the sights and sounds of an environment that is intensely alive. Insects whir incessantly, while everything from beady-eyed black bats to flickering fireflies and brightly coloured macaws and butterflies suddenly appear. \nNature regularly surprises me at the lodge as well. Unseen creatures scuttle noisily under the boardwalks and, one evening, a frog sits silently on the sink, in the exact spot where my toothbrush had been seconds before. I turn to bring the candle closer, then look back. Like a city lost in the clouds, the frog has vanished, as suddenly and silently as it appeared. \nIF YOU GO \nGetting around: It’s difficult to arrange, and potentially dangerous to travel, the Inca Trail independently, so booking with a reputable tour operator is advisable (well in advance to secure limited trail permits). The journey described here is part of the 12-day Inca Trail and Amazon trip (from $3,010) by Intrepid Travel , which offers various Peru itineraries for small groups. \nEating and drinking: In Cuzco, try Peru’s signature cocktail, the pisco sour , at the Museo del Pisco (398 Santa Catalina Ancha), which is more lively bar than museum. At Ima Sumaq (350 Calle Triunfo), the maître d’ helps customers mix their own pisco sours, before serving traditional Peruvian fare such as guinea pig (cuy). (221 Plazoleta Nazarenas) prepares local ingredients with contemporary flair in an artfully designed space that feels more like Barcelona than Cuzco. \nSleeping: Fallen Angel is also a stylish guest house, but for a good mid-range Cuzco hotel, try Emperador Plaza (377 Santa Catalina Ancha).
