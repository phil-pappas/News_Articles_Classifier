By this time, these packing aids have been around a while, and if you travel with any frequency, you either love them and use them religiously, or don’t get what all the fuss is about. I fall in the former category, so I was happy to try MIU Color packing cubes and see how they stand up to a multi-flight travel day followed by 10 days in Hawaii. \nHow are they different than all the rest? First of all, I love that the MIU packing cubes feature a mesh panel, which allows the clothes inside to breathe, but more importantly, allows me to see what’s in each cube without having to unzip them. MIU is a great value, too: for what you might pay for one or two cubes elsewhere, you get a set of four cubes in a variety of sizes. Each has a carrying handle at the top for easy transporting, tossing, and storing in hotel room drawers, and each has a quality zipper with strong zipper pulls and reinforced lining. \nWhat you don’t get: compression. Unlike some cubes on the market, the MIU Color cubes cannot be further compressed. This may or may not matter to you. For me, I like compression cubes when my bag will be very stuffed, but find it far easier to get in and out of regular cubes. When I’ll be digging into my bag often, I opt for non-compression cubes. \nThe MIU Color four piece set comes with three clothing bags and one shoe bag. You get: 1 large cube at 17.7x13x2.8 inches 1 medium cube at 14×10.6×2.75 inches 1 small cube at 11×6.7×2.8 inches 1 shoe cube at 12.4x8x4.3 inches \nI like the large cube for outerwear for winter travel, but for the Hawaii trip I packed for, I used this cube for dresses and the few pairs of pants I wanted to take. I could fit six sundresses plus two pairs of pants, when rolled. The medium and small cube are not too different in size; either work well for shorts, t-shirts, and blouses when rolled. I used the medium for this purpose, and reserved the small for undergarments and swimsuits. In the shoe cube, I fit three pairs of sandals. In winter, I could definitely fit one pair of walking shoes, plus socks. Of course, someone with bigger fit would have less luck. The shoe cube has a firm panel on one side, which helps shoes keep their form in your bag. I wouldn’t have thought of the welfare of my shoes, but depending on the type, this could be a good feature. \nOne feature I love about just about any packing cube that definitely holds true for MIU Color: you can toss them in the wash along with your dirty clothes. I’ve found that if I don’t pack them too tight with clothes, I can toss the whole thing in the wash with dirty clothes in them. This is such a nice organizational feature when you’re traveling…and when you get home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T15:58:47.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
