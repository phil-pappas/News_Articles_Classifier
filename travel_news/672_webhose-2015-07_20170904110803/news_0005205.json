The Minister added that such articles affect the Seychelles brand of tourism and the image that the country is promoting. \"A satisfied client is a plus for Seychelles as the person will go back to his or her country and promote the good service given while holidaying here. We should all realize the importance of our tourism industry and remember that it is the pillar of the Seychelles economy,” the Seychelles Minister for Tourism and Culture said. \nMinister St.Ange saluted Mr. Michael Payet and the News Extra team at the Seychelles Broadcasting Corporation as well as the other media houses for helping the Ministry and the Seychelles Tourism Board to keep members of the public informed on the happenings in the tourism industry. \nMinister St.Ange also spoke about other points such as his door-to-door visits to tourism establishments in the country, direct flights to Paris, and the moratorium imposed on large hotel projects in the country, an announcement that was made by Seychelles President James Michel on National Day. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
