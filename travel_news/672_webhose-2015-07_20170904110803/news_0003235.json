As SACO prepares for the launch of its first European aparthotel in Amsterdam in 2016, this new position is integral to the growth of its European operations, as well as providing it with local representation and support for a growing portfolio of international clients. \nKlaschka will be based in Dusseldorf, with the role of building SACO’s presence within continental Europe. She is also tasked with scaling up operations across Europe in line with SACO’s continued European expansion. Commenting on her appointment, Ben Harper, Sales Director at SACO, said: “Melanie is a perfect fit for our growing team. Her experience in global sales roles with both Bridge Street and Furnished Quarters in New York, gives her a unique insight into the industry.” “For a company focused on people and experience, it’s essential for us to grow with both great people and excellent properties and, having already worked with one of our key partners, Furnished Quarters, Melanie has a clear understanding of the SACO values and our vision for the future.” Klashka’s appointment follows the announcement of SACO’s evolved brand approach last month, with a new campaign and brand positioning strategy “beapartofit”, aiming to drive the serviced apartment sector forward and meet the needs of travel buyers, bookers and travellers. In 2016 and 2017, SACO will be opening and operating a wide range of further properties in the UK and into Europe, taking its total number of operated apartments to over 1,600. As well Amsterdam, there will also be new properties in cities such as London, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dublin, with others to follow, some of which will be SACO aparthotels and whilst others will be the company’s new Beyonder concept.
