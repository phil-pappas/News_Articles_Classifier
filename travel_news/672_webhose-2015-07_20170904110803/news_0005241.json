Made of high-quality, soft, stretchy polyester with Spandex (elastane), these non-disposable swimsuits are fit for even the most chlorinated pools or the saltiest seawater.\n“Believe it or not, even during summer time, 20% of all hotel guests arrive having forgotten entirely about swimwear. Most of them being men,” explains Emmanuel Gohet, who is the Marketing Manager for Caractère Paris. “It’s always a bit embarrassing for the guests, but they always ask the receptionist if they have something to borrow or to buy to jump in the swimming pool during the seasonal hot weather. We’ve worked to provide an affordable solution for hospitality service providers.”\nThe swimsuits are offered in three different styles including:\nTwo piece bikini: Triangular cups with discreet padding and extra breast support, and a comfortable white lining in the bra and crotch area. Ties around the neck and on both hips, which ensures a secure and adjustable fit.\nOne piece: Scoop-cut back, with discreet padding and extra breast support, and a comfortable white lining in the bra and crotch area. Brief-style Shorts – Stretchy; lined with a comfortable, protective layer of white mesh fabric, an elastic waistband and a tie-cord.\nBoxer-style shorts: Lower thigh length, lined with a comfortable, protective layer of soft white mesh fabric and an elastic waistband to ensure a secure and pleasing fit.\nAll suits are made from 95% Polyester and 5% Spandex elastane, with fibers intermeshed for a comfortable fit. Prices vary from £32.28 to £38.88 for a pack of 6 that includes two suits for men, two for women and 2 for kids from sizes XS to 4XL to accommodate the diversity of guests.\n“Unlike most companies, we offer the bathing suits in just one color, black. This ensures a stylish, comfortable and practical swimwear look through its classic color, allowing to keep costs low for purchasers and guests who purchase them as well.”\nWhether it be a complimentary item or sold to guests of resorts, spas and public pools, Caractère Paris’s latest luxury style swimsuits adhere to regulation and dress codes that do not permit the use of other, more risqué or loose cut swimwear, providing a prime solution for hotels and guests alike. Priced at about £5 each, hospitality companies now have affordable and functional options that allow both profit and added customer service to guests in need of a swimsuit.\nAbout the company:\nFounded in 1993, Caractère Paris is a French manufacturer of disposable linens that services the hospitality industry and service providers throughout Europe, mainly markets in France and Germany. They are a trusted company with prestigious clients such as Hilton International and Accor Hotel, with a strong presence on the web with online direct sales for small B&B, beauty parlors and boutiques.\nFor media inquiries regarding Caractère Paris, those interested are encouraged to contact the company’s Marketing Manager, Emmanuel Gohet directly at + 33 1 49 89 01 83 or via email at This email address is being protected from spambots.
