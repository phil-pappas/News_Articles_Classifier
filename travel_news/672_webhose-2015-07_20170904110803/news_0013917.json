The desert metropolis which thrives on 24-hour gambling, showgirls and casinos without a clock in sight to remind revellers of the world outside.\nS ynonymous with hedonism, this adult playground has grown to attract millions of visitors annually, each bringing with them trillions of dollars to its Nevada location.\nDespite its reputation for excess and surrealism, as a natural oasis in the Mojave desert, America's City of Lights was actually established in 1829 for practical reasons . Mexican explorer and merchant, Antonio Armijo, first sought to open up the area as a trade route between Mexico and California, called the Old Spanish Trail.\nWhen the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad were created in 1905, the small settlement quickly became known as 'Sin City.' With pink limousines, tacky souvenirs and the gigantic Vegas strip, the larger-than-life city became a beacon in the desert over the years - but it didn't always look that way.\nRevealed in rare retrospective photographs are the vintage cars parked outside casinos for a weekend escape, swim-up gambling tables, and the glamour of 1950's showgirls. The city that lured Hollywood's glitterati including Elvis Presley and Gene Kelly is strikingly different to the illuminated, bustling hot spot of today.\nIn its first flush of popularity the rich and famous of the golden era were greeted by empty desert streets and a handful of burgeoning venues only hinting at their future fortunes.\nScroll down for video\nFirst glimmer: The main strip in Las Vegas during the golden era hints at its potential for growth.
