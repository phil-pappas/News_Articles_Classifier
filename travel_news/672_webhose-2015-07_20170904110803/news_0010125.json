(Shutterstock) \nIf the party animal in you is hooked to drugs like Ecstasy, you could experience sexual problems like erectile dysfunction (ED), a new study has revealed. \nAnd the problems are not limiting to ED as other side effects of amphetamines reported by participants of the study include enhanced sexual desire, spontaneous erections upon injection, delayed or multiple orgasms, reduced libido, impaired ejaculation and difficulty in achieving orgasm. \nParty drugs, a common synonym for drugs like Ecstasy or amphetamines, are a group of drugs that stimulate the central nervous system. \n\"Compared with 211 matched controls, amphetamine users were twice as likely to experience erectile dysfunction,\" says Bang-Ping Jiann, senior author from the Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital in Taiwan. \nIn a study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, researchers analysed 1,159 males who illicitly used amphetamines. \nHalf of the participants reported impacts such as reduced erectile rigidity and sexual satisfaction, enhanced orgasmic intensity and delayed ejaculation. \nThe other half of the users, however, reported that amphetamines had no effect on their sexual functions. \nPrevious research has found that amphetamine abuse can cause a wide range of changes in sexual functions. \nFuture research is required to accurately determine the effects of amphetamines on the sexual functions of men, the study said.
