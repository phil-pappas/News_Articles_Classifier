Using drone photography of the Royal Armouries Museum and New Dock Hall, in Leeds, will enable us to showcase our beautiful, modern, waterfront surroundings in a way that hasn’t been possible previously. \nIt offers clients and customers, some who have never been “up north” before, a bird’s eye view of where their next event will be held in relation to Leeds City Centre. ‘I believe using technological advances is vital in such a fast paced industry. The results of drone photography and video techniques are impressive and it’s great that we can utilise these. I’m really looking forward to seeing the reaction from our clients and believe this will bring us more business’ – James Vincent, Managing Director, Royal Armouries (International) plc.
