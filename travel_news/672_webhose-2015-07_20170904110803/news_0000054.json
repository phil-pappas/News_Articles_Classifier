The low-fare carrier announced Tuesday that it has added twice-weekly, nonstop service between PIE and Memphis International Airport starting on October 1. Allegiant is also engaged in a labor dispute with its pilots , who have twice attempted to strike but have been enjoined from doing so by a federal judge in Las Vegas, where the airline is based.
