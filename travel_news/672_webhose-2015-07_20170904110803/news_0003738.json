I’m proud to say that HomeEscape is free – from start to finish.”\nHomeEscape advertising-based revenue model allows it users to upload and view listings for free, regardless whether they are home owners or travelers. “Since we are free, we do not require any payment information, and as such, HomeEscape users will benefit from increased security and protection from any unauthorized transactions,” Vaknin stated.\n“Although our best features will always remain free, we do offer a premium service that gives preferential listing exposure to members that wish to market their properties more extensively. However, this is entirely voluntarily, and we expect the majority of our users will stay with the free service,” said Vaknin.\nContact:\nKelsey Nichols\nhttps://www.homeescape.com/contact/", "external_links": ["http://www.vrma.com/", "http://www.avivaknin.com/", "https://www.homeescape.com/why-free/", "https://www.homeescape.com/contact/&nbsp;", "https://www.homeescape.com/"], "published": "2015-07-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T00:37:50.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
