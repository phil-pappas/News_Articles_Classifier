Photo by Benet J. Wilson Travelers have come to expect airports to offer free Wi-Fi. While most of the top 24 U.S. airports do offer free Wi-Fi, there are some that still charge for the service. A Wi-Fi study by iPass notes that business travelers hit the road with an average of three connected devices.\nRespondents to iPass listed “lack of connectivity” as a huge challenge to business travel, saying finding and accessing Wi-Fi is one of the top challenges they face when they travel.\n“Looking at the big picture, business travelers really want four things from their Wi-Fi connection when they are on the road: cost, ease, security and ad-free,” it said.\nWi-Fi connectivity is the method of choice, thanks to its speed, cost-effectiveness and bandwidth, said the report. Seventy-four percent of business travelers would choose Wi-Fi over cellular data when traveling—if they can get it. Almost 77 percent reported that simple Wi-Fi connectivity is their greatest challenge to productivity when they’re on the road.
