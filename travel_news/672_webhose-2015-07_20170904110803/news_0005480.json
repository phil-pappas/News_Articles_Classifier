The exclusive One&Only collection of softly floating white cotton kaftans, dresses, shorts, shirts and shifts, adorned by colourful embroidery have been inspired by the beauty, elegance and understated glamour of the resorts of One&Only. The result is fresh and easy-to-wear pieces with a sense of holiday playfulness that effortlessly take guests from the beach to evening cocktails.\nThe new fashion label has been designed by One&Only’s Director of Retail, Preston Schroeder, and continues One&Only’s deep connection with fashion. The resorts’ NEO boutiques are stocked with a carefully curated collection of chic swimsuits, bikinis, kaftans and dresses from established global brands such as Stella McCartney and Victoria Beckham, through to up-and-coming labels and local treasures that Preston has personally identified for the One&Only guest.\nPreston is the only dedicated fashion buyer for a luxury hotel group and he attends all the major fashion weeks in New York, Paris, Milan and London to personally select pieces that One&Only guests will covet. Every year he also creates exclusive collaborations with leading fashion designers to launch bespoke statement pieces which are only available at One&Only Resorts. The 2015 season has seen One&Only partner with the world renowned fashion house Missoni to release a bespoke capsule collection and launch a Melissa Odabash pop-up store at One&Only Reethi Rah. Preston trained as a designer with Errol Arendz in South Africa in the 1990s and became an apprentice designer to Linda Cierach in London before working in management for brands such as Mulberry, Gucci, Selfridges and Browns.\n“It has been a privilege to design a dedicated One&Only fashion label as part of our commitment to offer guests something truly unique. One&Only holiday moments are a thing of beauty and joy to treasure, and it is our absolute passion to curate the very best fashion selection for our guests on holiday to truly enhance those moments,” commented Preston Schroeder. “The inaugaral One&Only collection is inspired by the beauty and style of each of our resorts, which I visit regularly. Each item of soft white cotton is embroidered with a delicate signature pattern in colours evocative of beaches, tropical foliage and sunshine. Our chic beach dress ‘Palmilla’ for example, is inspired by our beautiful Mexican resort, One&Only Palmilla. This classic shift style white cotton dress is balanced by a striking modern block of red embroidery across the neck and shoulders. Our kaftan ‘Palm’ is inspired by One&Only The Palm in Dubai and has delicate fresh green embroidery around the hem and neckline.”\nThe One&Only collection is available to buy at the NEO boutiques at One&Only Reethi Rah in the Maldives, One&Only Cape Town, One&Only Le Saint Géran in Mauritius, One&Only Ocean Club in The Bahamas and the newly reborn One&Only Palmilla in Mexico.\nRelated Posts 40% reduction in room rates in Grand Hyatt Taipei in July and August Express your love this Valentine’s Day at Calabash Cove Resort & Spa Jason Pomeranc, hotelier announces launch of new brand of hotel Sixty Hotels Melia Hotels International becomes a partner of the World Community Grid, initiative sponsored by IBM Energy recovery for metro trains and suburban trains is gathering speed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T16:50:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
