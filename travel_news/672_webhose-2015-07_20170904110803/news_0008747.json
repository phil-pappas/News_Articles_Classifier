To ride it, you'll whiz through three levels of slides via small, crystal-clear swimming pools. Then, you'll end with a dunk in the shimmering Gulf of Castellammare . Ahh .

There are restaurants, a health club and, of course, an Italian pizzeria to explore, with the glory of Sicily just beyond your guest room door. \n...but we'll probably just stay on the water slide, thanks. \nAlso on HuffPost: 11 Insanely Cool Bodies Of Water of", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T06:21:29.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
