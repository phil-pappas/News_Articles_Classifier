Picture: AFP Source: AFP \nJETSTAR has cancelled all flights in and out of Bali tonight but is hopeful of resuming services in the morning. \nThe low fares carrier had earlier delayed scheduled services in the hope the ash cloud over Denpasar might clear but it is yet to oblige. \n“We regret the frustration these cancellations will cause our customers however we will always put safety before schedule,” a Jetstar spokesman said. \n“As we’ve seen during the past three weeks, the movement of this ash cloud remains highly unpredictable.” \nVirgin Australia cancelled ten of its flights in and out of Bali, and has announced it will delay daytime flights from Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane to Denpasar tomorrow by at least an hour. \nPassengers are advised to go to airports in line with the new times, and further advice will be provided at 10am. \nThe volcanic ash cloud being pumped out of Mount Raung remains over Denpasar creating unfavourable conditions for flying. \nEruptions have gone on for more than three weeks now, but the intensity increased yesterday. \nA wind change early tomorrow is expected to again push the ash cloud clear of Bali giving air traffic a better chance of operating to schedule.
