ADVERTISEMENT \nIt also won in 2009. \nOcean City is known for its popular boardwalk, amusement rides and miniature golf courses, restaurants and bayfront boating and water sports. \nThis year, Ocean City won the online vote for best beach; best day-trip beach; best family vacation beach; and top beach for ecotourism. It is a dry town, where the sale of alcohol is prohibited. Many residents and vacationers say that contributes to the family-friendly reputation of the resort. \nAs usual, Cape May County beaches dominated the voting, taking the top five slots. \nThis year’s runners-up were Wildwood; Wildwood Crest; Sea Isle City; North Wildwood; Asbury Park; Manasquan; Belmar; Brigantine; and Long Beach Township. \nSince the contest began in 2008, either Ocean City or the Wildwoods (the three Wildwood municipalities used to compete as a single entity) has won the vote. \nThe contest is sponsored by the New Jersey Sea Grant Consortium and Stockton College as a way of making people feel more connected to and protective of the state’s 127-mile coastline.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T07:41:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
