I’m getting a cramp.”\n“Help me get an eraser out of my child’s nose.”\n*Cringe.*\nBeing a flight attendant may have its perks but it definitely also has its quirks, and some of the things they are asked to do in the sky are unbelievable.\nAccording to a survey by LastMinute.com.au , some Australians simply aren’t toeing the line when it comes to mile-high etiquette.\nWhile 6 per cent of Aussies surveyed admitted to having made a “weird” mile-high request, it seems it can be worth speaking up, with most of them having their wish granted (80 per cent of the time).\n“The customer admissions show cabin crew certainly go the extra mile for passengers, from being a matchmaking service, to giving away their perfume and even surprising customers with a birthday song over the PA system,” LastMinute.com.au spokeswoman Kate Norri said.\n“Personally, I have seen first hand some of the interesting situations flight attendants have to deal with. Once on a six-hour flight from Brisbane to Perth, I witnessed a flight attendant having to diplomatically ask an enthusiastic passenger to stop singing at the top of his voice, as it was very distracting to the other passengers on board”.\nYOUR SAY: Have you had a strange flight experience? Tell us below.\nYou’re joking, right? Picture: Michael Coghlan Source: Twitter\nHere are some of the most unusual requests Aussies have made:\n• “I asked an attendant to surprise my partner with birthday cake. They were really helpful and packaged it into her meal. To make up for not having candles, they sang over the PA system.”\n• “I asked the flight attendant to reveal the seat assignment of a passenger with my rare last name, which I discovered by accident at check-in. They did and it turned out to be a distant relative I’d never met.”\n• “I asked if I could not sit next to a male in business class — as they can snore very loud.”\n• “I asked a Qantas flight attendant for some of the crew’s Vegemite — they gave it.”\n• “I told the flight attendant my 3-year-old son would cry if they didn’t make him bacon and eggs in the middle of the night (while flying first class).”\nMake me some bacon!

The flight attendant connected us and we ended up going out for a while!”\n• “I asked for help getting my husband’s boots off on a long flight. He ignored my advice to wear slip-on or lace up shoes and wore long pull-on boots. His feet swelled up on the flight and his boots would not come off without a lot of assistance from the flight attendant.”\n• “I wanted to know the name of the flight attendant’s perfume. She ended up giving me the bottle to keep!”\nOriginally published as Aussies’ shocking mile-high confessions", "external_links": ["http://www.lastminute.com.au/", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/07/1227432/017969-ca51a9c0-243c-11e5-879d-8a7d7d6a1553.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/07/1227432/018003-99909428-2440-11e5-879d-8a7d7d6a1553.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/strange-mile-high-confessions-of-aussies/story-fnndib5x-1227432018997"], "published": "2015-07-08T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T20:16:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
