ResorTime also donated resort accommodations to the silent and live auctions, which generated more than $8,000. \n“We’re proud to count athletes such as Earl and Tyler Campbell as friends and partners in the fight against MS,” said Renee Wagner, RRP, Director of Marketing for ResorTime. “Our core purpose is ‘Enriching Lives by Creating Experiences Worth Sharing.’ There are few experiences more enriching than helping students who thought higher education was out of reach due to MS.” \nThe $2,300 check represented the proceeds from ResorTime’s First and Ten promotion, which donated 10 percent of bookings to the non-profit when guests used a specific promo code. As a thank you, guests received 10 percent discount on their vacation. In addition, ResorTime donated vacations in Hawaii, Southern California, Mexico, Napa, Palm Springs, and Lake Tahoe to the live and silent auctions in order to raise additional funds. \n“ResorTime has been a longtime supporter of our cause,” said Tyler Campbell of the Pro Player Foundation. “Their generous contributions empower us to make a difference in the lives of countless college students with MS and their families.” \nThe donations continue a longstanding partnership. At the Flavors of Austin in Texas, ResorTime presented a $2,500 check to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. The non-profit received the most votes from guests when it was featured on the ResorTime website alongside two other charities as part of the beCause Destination Matters giving program, which gives organizations a platform to share their story with a wider audience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T22:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T23:11:06.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
