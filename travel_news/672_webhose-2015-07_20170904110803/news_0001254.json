It’s worth noting at this juncture that the first day of any project always has a hint of bedlam about it, and as such I’ve always worked on the principle of managing expectations – a somewhat brutal process of telling everyone it’ll be rubbish, so if anything good happens it’s always a pleasant surprise. The snag in this theory is that we are all so absurdly excited to be here, and the rumour mill along the coast (very much a driving force of any sardine run) had gone into overdrive with talk of orcas, dolphins, and white sharks in the precise spot we were about to do our first dive. It’s tricky to manage expectations under these circumstances, but I did my best to be downbeat and low key anyway. Our first site was Port Elizabeth itself. I undermined my leadership credentials somewhat by asking at an early stage, very loudly, at dinner, with the entire team there, where the name came from. Doug Allan happened to be sitting next to me, and raised his eyebrows through a non existent hairline and leant over to say in a rather loud stage whisper: “I think it’s because it’s a Port. Named after Queen Elizabeth. So, Port Elizabeth you see, all rather clever.” Despite not knowing where the name came from, or taking the twelve seconds required to figure it out, I must say I’m rather taken with the place. A long seafront, an impressive port, and a bustling local scene only a short drive away. There’s something magical about any coastal city that has big breakers exploding onto long beaches and jetties, with cool brine and sea spray the predominant smell and taste as you walk the shore. It’s unseasonably cold here at present, two to three degrees Celsius in the mornings, but I like it. The combination of a bitter oceanic wind and fine spindrift made my skin tingle and shoulders hunch as I stood staring out to sea on this first memorable morning in Africa. But there is business to be done, the predominant part of which involves getting two boats filled with divers, scientists, and cameramen safely out onto the water and back again. This is no small undertaking. As I survey the horizon, I might be standing with my back to neat clapperboard houses and manicured lawns, but before me lies wilderness. If you take liberties when exploring this coastline in small boats, or when diving on its reefs, you will pay the price. I had a sleepless night before this first foray out to sea, endlessly turning over possibilities and probabilities, seeking solutions to limited boat space related to people and kit, both of which we seemed to have in alarmingly large quantities. Fortified by gallons of coffee (“Imagine if you will that I’m a unique type of forest fire,” I said to our baffled waiter at breakfast, “and I can only be extinguished by vats of powerful coffee. That’s how much is required”) I set out the next morning at the head of our convoy to the docks. Behind me were ten Land Rovers, two boats on trailers, and twenty people. This is probably as good a point as any to talk about pressure. I’m feeling real pressure to deliver here. Lots of people have been extraordinarily generous in helping put this project together, and there’s lots at stake in terms of producing results. We’ve planned impeccably, spending months looking at itineraries, the minutiae of the route, and risk assessing every single angle. Visibility was poor on the first day In fact, I believe I may have even written a Risk Assessment on the inherent risks involved in writing a Risk Assessment. But despite all this planning, there are two elements over which we have no control. One is the sea, and the other is the sardines. Both are a law entirely to themselves, contradictory and fickle, given to whims that defy all prediction. And so luck will play a huge part in the next two weeks as we make our progress up the convoluted bays and inlets of the coastline. But at least this morning it looked like we were certain to get onto the water if nothing else. Dawn touched a gathering of gun-metal clouds on the horizon, gravid with rain, but they were a long way off and sitting tight. As we launched our two boats, the radio crackled into life and a disembodied voice informed Louis, our skipper, that a huge pod of dolphins had been sighted in the bay. It’s @brettandersen here, beginning my Instagram takeover for @landrover. Our first full day in South Africa had us up with the sunrise in Port Elizabeth. We put our RIBs to the test, loading them up and diving off the coast at ‘Shark Alley’. We then piled into a convoy of Land Rovers, and drove a few hours to the Shamwari Game Reserve. #SpiritOfAdventure #Defender A photo posted by Land Rover (@landrover) on Jul 17, 2015 at 1:57pm PDT We had been told the previous day that orcas were also in residence, and that great whites were a lurking presence throughout the route. Once briefings had been completed, safety checks done, kit stowed on board, and everyone was in place, we opened up the throttles and headed out into the heaving waters of the Eastern Cape. The resultant dive wasn’t quite the festival of top predators we had anticipated. Perhaps it’s best summed up by the simple numbers. Maximum depth - twelve metres. Underwater visibility - one metre. Number of sharks seen - one. It was rather like diving in soup, but quite cold soup. Gazpacho perhaps. Having crawled about in the gloom for twenty minutes, myself and Doug did bump into one medium sized ragged tooth shark, which was having a snooze in a gulley. Our arrival startled it somewhat, particularly as we had abruptly appeared out of the murk at a range of 50cm, and immediately pointed a large camera at it. The shark reacted in the same way most of us would, and turned tail in disgust. And all this despite the fact that the man behind the camera was the pre-eminent underwater film maker of his generation. Doug has been at this so long that most large marine animals know him personally, and the ones that don’t have certainly heard of him. But even Doug’s stellar filming CV wasn’t enough to make this particular shark hang about, and it fled at some speed. It may well still be going even as I type. Just writing today's blog - suffice to say we saw a shark and it was considerably more surprised than we were.... pic.twitter.com/efRcsHNB0U — Monty Halls (@MontyHalls) July 17, 2015 After blundering about for another twenty minutes, we decided to call it a day and headed for the surface. In South Africa this can be an un-nerving place to be, particularly on a bumpy old day during the sardine run. Happily the boat was on us very quickly, Louis being the splendid skipper he is, and we hauled ourselves out like penguins onto a passing ice floe. Meanwhile Ivan, skipper of Ocean 5 (our other boat) was helping Meag [shark scientist and founder of the South African Shark Conservancy] get into the ideal position over the reef to deploy her remote cameras and some hand lines. The idea was to catch some smaller sharks to tag them, take some DNA samples, then return them to the water. We fished valiantly for two hours, and caught nothing. I was thinking a lot about great whites by this stage - and why not? They’ve occupied the darkest recesses of our imaginations for as long as people have been going to sea – as the recent footage of the surfer Mick Fanning shows. It’s all quite unfair of course - we as a species are utterly obsessed with anything that can potentially make a meal of us. My concerns on this day were more prosaic, as I was slightly perturbed at the thought of half of a ton of shark, driven by a furiously pumping tail and 350 million years of evolutionary efficiency, grabbing the sardine I was dangling over the side as bait (the only sardine I saw all day incidentally) and taking me with it. Waterski-ing in rubber pumps behind a furious great white might thoroughly be in the spirit of exploration and adventure, but wasn’t something I fancied on day one. Happily, my sardine went unmolested. Monty Halls's first day at sea And so we returned to the dock, somewhat chastened but nonetheless happy that we’d at least got into the water. There’s 1,000 km ahead of us, deeper dives in clearer water, and large predators that will be more than just a rumour. For now I was happy to just count all the divers out, and count them all back. The next two weeks will not be easy. The weather forecast is rather cheeky to say the least, and we will face huge challenges further up the coast as launch facilities dwindle and we begin to rely on our vehicles and lots of initiative to get out to sea. But out there lies real magic, with the promise of encounters we will remember for the rest of our lives only the spin of a propeller away. Onward, ever onward. Entry one: arrival I write this first blog in a fug of jet lag and sleep deprivation. I’m hurtling at 35,000 feet towards Port Elizabeth in South Africa , squeezed into an amusingly small seat which requires me to keep my elbows pinned to my sides, and to type this first missive with my hands held close to my chest in a look that is akin to a squirrel juggling an acorn. All of this comes at the end of a very long journey indeed, as I’ve flown in from Bali (having just completed a two week diving project there). We dodged volcanic ash over Java en route, and I’ve run the gauntlet of customs and queues in Singapore and Johannesburg. I’m exhausted, in that special way one only gets at the end of a very long series of flights. But stirring within me is a profound sense of anticipation, strong enough to prevent sleep. I’m nearly there, nearly at the end of my journey - the location of two great gatherings. The first of these gatherings is the sardine run. First reported in the Natal Mercury paper on August 4, 1853, this is one of the great global events of the marine calendar. It involves vast shoals of sardines moving north along the coast of the Eastern Cape and Natal, with numbers immeasurable to man. They are pursued by anything with teeth, a beak – or a camera. Monty prepares for an epic trip Oddly enough for an event that occurs so regularly, and is so readily accessible from shore, science still knows very little about “The Run”. It has grown steadily in commercial importance over the last few decades both for commercial fishermen and the tourist industry. The stretch of coastline where the run occurs already has some of the most exciting marine creatures in the world, riding the warm waters of the Agulhas Current as it sweeps south offshore. The Sardine Run is a biological bombshell that explodes in its midst once a year through in June and July. I am here to try to experience it, and to attempt to tell something of the tale of the animals that trail in its wake. But I will not do so alone. The second gathering is a group of scientists, adventurers and film makers who will accompany me throughout. This is no rag tag bunch of amateurs - the underwater cameraman is Doug Allan (he of Blue Planet fame, Frozen Planet fame, Planet Earth fame, and pretty much any-other-BBC-documentary-that-has-the-word-Planet-in-it-fame). Doug is short, Scottish, tough as teak, and completely fearless. One of Doug Allan's trademark images Photo: Doug Allan We could be twins actually, as I am tall, English, of questionable fortitude, and have a keen sense of my own preservation. Also accompanying us is Meaghen McCord, redoubtable shark scientist and founder of the South African Shark Conservancy. She will be co-ordinating our shark tagging and DNA sampling efforts. The team itself is made up of four young Canadian adventurers who won a global competition to join us. I ran a training weekend for them in the UK in anticipation of this project, and they are phenomenally capable outdoorsmen, annoyingly young, irritatingly handsome, and altogether made of the right stuff. They are also passionate surfers, and will be periodically riding the waves that hammer this wild stretch of coastline. Gentlemen (and ladies) start your engines. The Shoals of Agulhas Expedition begins. Watch this space for more updates pic.twitter.com/PHV9prb8Cq — Monty Halls (@MontyHalls) July 16, 2015 The essence of the project is to take a fleet (I think we’re up to a total of ten vehicles, so the term “fleet” is just about applicable) of Land Rovers 1,000km along the coast, towing two boats and carrying filming and scientific gear. We’ll be calling in on various land based conservation projects en route as well as tracking the sardine run itself. It is perhaps the ultimate wildlife road trip, certainly exciting and adventurous enough to keep a jet lagged man from sleep. Big seas, wild waters, crazy wildlife - welcome to SA @LandRover @fourth_element @SuuntoDivingUK @RaymarineInc pic.twitter.com/Oa485jkw6r — Monty Halls (@MontyHalls) July 17, 2015 And so we begin. The seatbelt light has just come on, my tray table is very much upright, and my seat returned to the absolute vertical. We have been working on the logistics for this project for several months, and in Port Elizabeth there are vehicles, kit and people waiting for the expedition to begin. Off the coast the sardines pulse and heave in vast dark shoals, riven and split by assaults from shark, dolphin, gannet and whale. Let the show begin. Essentials Monty Halls is leading the expedition to experience first-hand the sardine run, one of the world’s most spectacular marine events. Monty Halls is an ambassador for Land Rover ( landrover.co.uk ), who are supporting the Shoals of Agulhas expedition with a fleet of Land Rover Discovery Sports and Defenders including Halls’ own Marine Defender. The expedition is part of Land Rover's \"Spirit of Adventure\" competition, where the winner, Brett Andersen and three of his friends gained the opportunity to join Monty on the two-week journey.
