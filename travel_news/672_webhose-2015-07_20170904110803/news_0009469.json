Perfect for long flights or unfamiliar hotel rooms, or those times when you'd like to block out crying babies, party noise or just fall asleep to quiet tunes.\nTHE BAD For now, the mask may not fit to extend over the ears.

Topics include cultural, historic, arts and crafts, faith, food and wine, books and music. Add whether you've been to the festival, want to save it for later or are already going, and it will make a calendar list for you.\nWHAT'S HOT The site includes a huge number of small-town festivals and celebrations, many of which you've probably never heard of, like the Ramen Yokocho Festival in the Los Angeles area. You can search for festivals all over the world, though you'll get better results by search for a city hub.\nWHAT'S NOT Search results are heavy on Texas events at first, which makes sense since Everfest's founders are from Austin.

The app even adjusts vertical videos so you can use them with your horizontal ones. Need tips or inspiration? Don't miss the Instagram feed @editonthefly.\nWHAT'S NOT You can't include photos in your video at the moment, though a new feature with that ability will launch this summer.\nDreamCheaper.com (Credit: DreamCheaper.com)\nNAME DreamCheaper.com\nWHAT IT DOES Forward your hotel booking confirmation email (for hotels with free cancellation) to hotel@dreamcheaper.com. If DreamCheaper finds the same room -- or better -- at a cheaper price, it will book it for you and cancel your previous, more expensive reservation.\nWHAT'S HOT Savings keep getting bigger if you're booking more than one room for more than a day or two. The site claims to have found savings for two out of three bookings and cut rates anywhere from 15 percent to 60 percent. Visit the \"All about the financials\" section in Frequently Asked Questions if you want more information about the payment process.\nWHAT'S NOT It works best when one person does the booking.

It's a new movie-rental option found in several North American airports. It works in conjunction with a digital rental kiosk.\nWHAT'S HOT It's great if you have a long layover. The kiosk directions are easy to understand and the app downloads quickly. The best part? You don't have to rely on sluggish airport Wi-Fi because the Digiboo kiosk has its own.\nWHAT'S NOT Movies take a long time to download (15 minutes). User reviews are fairly poor on both iTunes and Google Play: User experiences seemed to differ depending on their devices and Wi-Fi strength at various airports. -- Los Angeles Times\nHotelsByDay (Credit: iStock)\nNAME HotelsByDay\nAVAILABLE iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, requires iOS 7 or later; also available for Android on Google Play.\nCOST Free\nWHAT IT DOES The app lists hotels that will let you book a room for the day (10 a.m.-4 p.m.) instead of overnight.

Subscription email alerts for personalized hotel deals or price drops are also available.\nWHAT'S HOT The \"freebies\" filter on the left navigation bar will show you how many hotels in your search result offer free breakfast, Internet, parking and child care. The search defaults to results with the best savings, but if you want to dig deeper you can sort by value, price or rating. Also make sure to use the three-star filter (not just four- and five-star properties) if you want to include big-value hotels that you might not otherwise consider.\nWHAT'S NOT The filter bar with \"Savings Types\" is a little confusing. -- Los Angeles Times\nBest parking app (Credit: BestParking.com)\nNAME Best Parking app\nCOST Free\nCOMPATIBLE WITH iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, requires iOS 7.0 or later.

You also can provide exact dates to buy tickets before a trip. It can help stretch vacation dollars, especially if you are on a family vacation and need tickets for four or more people. Some events may be a welcome surprise, such as the Wynwood Food Tour in Miami.

You may still have to answer a few questions from the passport-control officer, but you'll avoid a long customs line.

They're also square, which means they won't roll all the way to the back of the plane if your little one does knock them down.

It's a visually appealing, quick-to-use app with hostel photos, reviews and pricing upfront. If you're looking for hostels that surprise and are easy on your wallet, you'll find them here, like Casa Alto Vidigal ($12 a night) in Rio de Janeiro.\nWHAT'S NOT The review categories are extremely positive -- \"It's clean!\" \"Awesome staff!\" and \"I love this place!\" -- so if the hostel you're considering has only two out of five stars, be careful.

The handle uses Gillette Fusion blades.\nTHE GOOD This thing looks a lot more like art than something as pedestrian as a men's razor. But appearance aside, this razor is so nicely balanced in the hand, it's actually fun to shave. Most important, it was designed to easily expel accumulated hair with a single run under the water. Why can't every manufacturer do this?\nTHE BAD Expense, plain and simple.

Don't miss the \"Scout Collections\" if you're looking for the most \"extreme steeps,\" the best family resorts or lodges with the best hot tubs.\nWHAT'S NOT In the \"Browse & Book\" section, some of the pinned resorts led only to pop-up descriptions.

The book includes maps of each Disney park, information on each ride, and tips and advice galore. This is the 25th edition of the book, and the writers have each visited the parks at least 60 times.\nTHE BAD The guide also covers Universal Orlando, SeaWorld & Aquatica but these parks are addressed in far less detail. And, when the book went to press, the newer Harry Potter offering at Universal Orlando hadn't yet opened, so that area is not covered in great detail.\nCOST $21.99\nINFO Fodors.com\nStorehouse.co (Credit: Storehouse.co)\nNAME Storehouse app and Storehouse.co\nAVAILABLE FOR iPhone and iPad\nCOST Free\nWHAT IT DOES Select photos from your iPhone or iPad and turn them into a magazine-like photo essay.\nWHAT'S HOT It's quick.

What makes this book worthwhile is the way Smith integrates great writing, humor and technical knowledge. He juxtaposes wide-eyed wonder (comparing the aurora borealis, \"a quivering, horizon-wide curtain of fluorescence\" to \"G-d's laundry flapping in the night sky\") with practical, fear-alleviating answers to questions such as \"Why does a plane bump, jig and turn at steep angles during climbout?\"\nTHE BAD Airplane buffs might find the material familiar.\nCOST $14.99\nINFO Amazon.com -- Malerie Yolen-Cohen\nGolfscape.com (Credit: Golfscape.com)\nNAME Golfscape.com\nWHAT IT DOES This website lets you plan and book golf games in the United States and 47 countries from your desktop, tablet or mobile device.

There are plenty of course photos, a map and lists of amenities and weather reports, plus golfers can rate and review the courses. Users can make instant bookings in California, Arizona and Nevada.\nWHAT'S NOT You're getting just a sneak peek at features.

The Giant is great for camping, long flights and blackouts, and it's compatible with Apple products, Androids and most electronic devices. It also serves as an LED flashlight for up to 700 hours of illumination.\nTHE BAD Squat and thicker than an iPhone and weighing more than half a pound, the Jackery Giant is heftier than a \"lipstick\"-size charger, so it's best stowed in a glove compartment or large backpack rather than a small purse.

With the Picnic Plus your hands are free to scramble up to your favorite mountaintop spots.

Five pie-shaped compartments inside the bag and drawstrings on both ends of the roll allow for easy access and organization. Straps along the body of the sack reduce volume by up to 50 percent.\nTHE GOOD This lightweight cylindrical bag fits more than you think it can and compresses down to almost football size. Watch the video on the website to see how Hoboroll users fit multiple pants, shirts, shoes, puffy jacket, raincoat and toiletries in one small sack. You can fit a Hoboroll in a larger backpack along with camping gear or wear it alone.\nTHE BAD If the Hoboroll is filled to capacity, the drawstrings at each end don't close completely, so it's not watertight.\nCOST $28\nINFO GobiGear.com . -- MALERIE YOLEN-COHENN\n(Credit: Wawwo)\nNAME Packpoint\nWHAT IT DOES Constructs an easy-to-use packing list, whether you're traveling for business or leisure, taking just the basics, bringing a baby or planning to do laundry.\nWHAT'S HOT The lists made with Packpoint were smart and quick to create.

One large cargo area, with two padded dividers, can hold a laptop, iPad, Kindle, etc. Two exterior compartments can take smaller items, such as a passport and phone.\nTHE GOOD This is the perfect \"personal bag,\" as the airlines call them. That means it's not a checked bag or even a carry-on. It can slide under an airline seat while easily holding all the clothes you might need for a few days, plus an iPad and other small electronics.

Even the most hesitant camper will feel more confident strolling into his or her campsite with info such as this: \"Remember to get a fire permit as well -- gathering driftwood is allowed, but toward the end of the summer it will likely be sparse, so bring a bundle!\"\nWHAT'S NOT The pictures of the general areas were beautiful, but they don't show actual campgrounds.

That means it's more linear (and seemingly easier to fit in an overhead bin). Even with the larger bags attached behind it, they will trail you neatly so you won't have to dodge travelers with fatter suitcases.\nTHE BAD The only thing you might miss are 360-degree wheels, but the slender design helps make up for more limited two-wheel maneuverability.

The open-front waterfall cardigan flatters the figure, draping to the top of the thigh. Ruching on the sleeves keeps them at three-quarter length without constant re-scrunching. Sophisticated enough for a dress, casual enough for yoga, it's available in seven colors.\nTHE BAD When the cardigan is worn, the pocket's Velcro closure is exposed to the shirt you're wearing beneath, so there's a slight chance of snagging delicate fabrics.\nCOST $99 for the Classic (rayon and spandex) or Lotus (moisture-wicking bamboo, rayon, spandex).\nAVAILABLE FROM thepocketpoppet.com . --Chicago Tribune\n(Credit: MCT)\nNAME OVVO Optics Phoenix polarized sunglasses\nWHAT THEY ARE Sunglasses composed of a steel-titanium composite that makes them incredibly light (they weigh less than an ounce), yet seemingly indestructible.

The company claims the frames, when stretched out flat, can hold 90 pounds without breaking.

The bag comes in red, light blue and black.\nTHE GOOD The bag holds enough for a week or weekend getaway and boasts plenty of utility despite its stylish look. The glossy patent finish cleans easily.\nTHE BAD Though the bag has plenty of structural support, it is soft-sided and might appear a little lumpy, depending on how you pack.\nCOST $250\nAVAILABLE FROM lipaultus.com -- Chicago Tribune\n(Credit: Gogobot.com)\nNAME Gogobot.com\nAVAILABLE ON Android, iOS, online\nCOST Free\nWHAT IT DOES Sources where to eat, stay and play based on 675,000 recommendations and 60,000 city guides around the world.\nWHAT'S HOT Heaps of new features, including the ability to share a travel itinerary among multiple users and to organize itineraries day by day and sync them with multiple devices. You don't need to set up an account in order to use the app to book a hotel, find restaurants or discover travel inspiration.\nWHAT'S NOT Search results for restaurants and things to do are tagged with themes or \"tribes,\" which is great. Unfortunately, clicking on tabs such as \"foodies\" or \"families\" doesn't work. The only way to see or edit your \"tribes\" within the app is to click on the \"Filter\" line in the bottom nav bar. -- Los Angeles Times\n(Credit: MCT / Handout) NAME 6-in-1 Grill Daddy Camping and Tailgating Grill Set\nWHAT IT IS An eight-piece grilling kit that provides a spatula, fork, spoon and tongs. It all fits nicely into a 121/2-by-61/2-inch zippered nylon carrying case.\nTHE GOOD A camper or traveler -- with a little practice -- can quickly and easily assemble the tools for whatever grilling task is called for. Though the disassembled kit is compact, the elements themselves are not miniaturized. The spatula face, for example, is a hefty 4 by 51/4 inches, and with the provided extensions the tools are full size. The heat shield also is a valuable asset. The stainless-steel utensils are dishwasher safe.\nTHE BAD The case's inner lining is a bit thin and tears after several uses.\nCOST $39.99\nAVAILABLE FROM Buygrilldaddy.com and retailers such as Home Depot, Brookstone and Sears. -- Chicago Tribune\n(Credit: OPEN GARDEN) NAME FireChat\nCOST Free app for iPhone and iPad available from Apple's iTunes store.

Open Garden's FireChat lets devices communicate within a 200-foot range, with messages hopping from device to device to extend the program's reach. The app uses a technology called mesh networking, which works off peer-to-peer connections via Wi-Fi radios in each phone.

Need a map to pinpoint the trail location? Done. Make sure you click on the initial map to get to trail run details and extra photos.\nWHAT'S NOT Is it too techie? Depends on you.

It comes with two saw blades that stow away in the hatchet handle.\nTHE GOOD A great tool for campers but likely not backpackers wary of weight; it's 3.4 pounds. The tree saw cuts through maples 3 inches in diameter in 30 to 45 seconds. The hatchet is sharp, nicely shaped and easily wielded. Just watch out for your legs if you chop downward; if you miss the wood, you could be on your way to the emergency room.\nTHE BAD It's not a toy. I wouldn't let older children use it unless they have had plenty of instruction and are supervised.\nCOST $79.95, but watch for sales\nAVAILABLE FROM zippo.com and amazon.com -- Chicago Tribune\n(Credit: Outski.com) NAME Outski.com\nCOST $7.95 to print and mail your Travel Savings Card to you.\nWHAT IT DOES Helps you achieve your travel goals by providing a system for saving money and organizing your travel budget.

It then lets you spend your funds with a Travel Savings Card that acts like a credit card. It's also great to have the flexibility to book a trip on the site.\nWHAT'S NOT Outski.com is still in beta so you might need to be patient. If you wanted to get a Visa brand Travel Savings Card, for example, you can't. All that's available is Discover. -- Los Angeles Times\n(Credit: Trevolta.com) NAME Trevolta.com\nWHAT IT DOES Helps travelers crowdfund their global adventures.\nCOST Varies depending on whether you have a fixed or flexible funding campaign. There's also a PayPal fee (the method used to collect donations).\nWHAT'S HOT Many of the trips are purpose- driven. Your \"funding campaign\" is placed in a category such as \"Charity and Volunteering,\" \"Education and Research,\" \"Music and Arts\" and more. If you're looking to solicit funds for your post-grad round-the-world romp, there are categories for that, too, such as \"Backpacking and Hiking\" and \"Adventure and Sport.\" Unique trips get attention, such as \"20 Cities in 50 Days in a Wheelchair,\" in which two men are trying to raise $6,000 to fund researching and writing a guide to wheelchair-accessible travel in 20 major U.S. cities.\nWHAT'S NOT Many of the campaigns listed on the site had already expired.

The stakes also are tough as nails and should penetrate any kind of ground except outright stone. The batteries will keep the stakes lit for 30 hours.\nTHE GOOD For anyone who has ever tripped over a tent stake and line in the dark, these stakes are a godsend. They also work as flashlights if you're heading to the bathhouse late at night, or if you want to read scary stories by the campfire.\nTHE BAD The lights turn on by rotating the light itself, so they might easily pop on while in storage or in transit. Keep tape on them while traveling or remove the batteries.\nCOST $4-$6 for a pack of two, plus shipping AVAILABLE FROM academy.com, amazon.com and go2outfitters.com, or check well-supplied outfitters stores. -- The Chicago Tribune\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISE HERE (Credit: AwayFind) NAME AwayFind\nAVAILABLE FOR Android and iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch (requires iOS 6.1 or later)\nWHAT IT DOES It lets you filter your email by topics and people you need to hear from while you're away.

You can even fine-tune what time of day you'd like to be notified.\nWHAT'S NOT The pricing plans don't allow for a vacationer's short-term needs. A starting price of $60 a year is a lot.\nWORTH IT? Yes, if you and your business can afford it. It works great, and the setup is quick and easy. You do get two months free if you pay upfront for the year. -- The Los Angeles Times\n(Credit: Dealscoopr.com) NAME Dealscoopr.com\nWHAT IT DOES This search tool helps you discover travel deals, including airfare and hotels.\nWHAT'S HOT The site remembers your home airport, so even if you don't like what you see on your main dashboard of \"favorite\" destinations, additional travel inspiration is a click away. On the left nav bar you'll find topic lists such as \"most amazing beaches,\" \"foodie cities\" and \"family and kid-friendly cities.\" When you select a list, up pop flight deals from your home airport to a dozen locations. Dealscoopr lets you select the departing month, then choose from a variety of start dates (such as traveling on a Friday or a Saturday, or leaving any Wednesday in the month) and the approximate trip duration.\nWHAT'S NOT It would be nice to have the ability to save and compare individual trips.\n-- Los Angeles Times\n(Credit: PowerPot) NAME PowerPot\nWHAT IT IS A thermoelectric cooking pot that produces up to 5 watts of power to charge smartphones, iPods, GPS devices, etc., when heating water. The 18.2-ounce kit includes a power-producing pot and a smaller pan, plus an electrical cord that plugs into the unit. The adapter has three sizes of plugs, and the main cord has a standard USB-size plug.\nTHE GOOD This is a camping geek's dream. In a couple of trial runs on a kitchen stove, the PowerPot charged an iPod by 10 to 15 percent while the pot simmered for 90 minutes and charged a BlackBerry by 50 percent while simmering for 70 minutes. If you let the pot boil, it will charge devices faster. The anodized aluminum pot and pan seem to resist marking.\nTHE BAD Some critics say the pot is too large for backpacking.\nCOST $149\nAVAILABLE FROM thepowerpot.com , rei.com and amazon.com\n(Credit: BonVoyaging.com) NAME BonVoyaging.com\nWHAT IT DOES It's a Web bookmarking tool that lets you collect and store your travel itineraries, complete with maps and the ability to download and share.\nCOST Free\nWHAT'S HOT This site boasts a beautiful, friendly design and the ability to print out a PDF of your itinerary.

It would be nice to have another browser tab open for BonVoyaging.com where you could toggle over and then edit the date and itinerary placement for the newly added activity. -- Los Angeles Times\n(Credit: ParkMe, Inc.)

You can sort your search results by \"Best Price\" or \"Least Pain.\" At some point, it's not worth saving $3 if you have to walk umpteen blocks to get to the cheaper lot.\nWHAT'S NOT The \"Nearby Places\" feature is hit or miss -- recommended places are sometimes 14 to 30 miles away.\nWORTH IT? Yes. Who likes looking for parking spaces or lots inexpensive enough to suit your budget?

Type your destination in the search bar, then click on \"Notes matching 'Peru,'\" for example, and you can scroll through quickly.\nWHAT'S NOT Don't forget to scroll right to left for more content.

Even better is the ability to combine the type of lodging you want with the type of animals or activities you are interested in. A search for a ranch in New Mexico yielded one where there was a cattle drive. Maybe you want to visit a reindeer farm in Alaska during winter break? Too easy.\nWHAT'S NOT The app is crowded with not one but two ads for the iPhone 4S. A paid version of the app is ad-free and includes pictures and longer descriptions of the farms.\nWORTH IT?

Rent your own home or use the list to find comfortable, kid-friendly residences for the price of a suite. Big, glossy pictures of the home and local tips for big and little travelers await.\nWHAT'S HOT Home rentals are great for families because they typically are more spacious than a hotel room and have a kitchen and laundry facilities. Breathe a motherly sigh of relief at houses and apartments with toy-filled kids' bedrooms and grassy backyards. Don't miss the \"Things to Know\" within the accommodation listing to get an inside look at a property's perks.\nWHAT'S NOT The site is in beta. Although it has more than 50 gorgeous destinations, there's usually just one accommodation listing per destination.

They come in sizes extra small to extra large.\nThe good Heat Holders makes socks for men, so it's good to know the company also makes similar products for women. The tights and leggings will definitely keep you warm and toasty during those last few days of winter -- even if the temperature dips to 10 below zero -- and they also may be the most comfortable tights you'll ever wear. The leggings are extremely durable and look stylish worn with a skirt and blazer for work.\nThe bad The leggings are less effective than the tights in extreme temps, but they are thin and comfortable and could work well as an extra layer under slacks.\nCost $14.99 each on usa.heatholders.com --Chicago Tribune\n(Credit: Localeur) Localeur (Free; available for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch)\nWHAT IT DOES Provides ideas on culture, entertainment, fitness and outdoors, food, neighborhoods, nightlife and shopping in Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, Houston and Austin, Texas.\nWHAT'S HOT There's a terrific mix of tips for foodies, nature lovers and culture seekers, with topics like \"Slurp Across L.A.: The City's Best Ramen Spots.\" You can keep a running list of favorite destinations and get directions by pressing the address. The tips come only from locals and the only way you can become a \"localeur\" is by being recommended by another localeur. There are 20 localeurs in each city, with more to come in the bigger cities.

Owner and renter never meet. FlightCar has parking lots at Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco airports. HOT: Rentals start at $10 a day, depending on the year and model of the car. A search for a weeklong rental in San Francisco yielded a coupe in the 2001-2008 age range for $15 a day, including tax, GPS and insurance. An SUV of the same vintage was $24 a day for the same dates. FlightCar also offers curbside pickup and has car seats, too. NOT: Keep your eye on your mileage. Ninety miles a day are included in the price, but after that you'll pay 35 cents a mile. --LOS ANGELES TIMES\n(Credit: Handout) NAME Sportswhereiam.com\nWHAT IT DOES See what your sports options are, based on where and when you're visiting. Then jump to info on tickets, news, live scores, sports bars, memorabilia and more.\nWHAT'S HOT The premise of the site is that you don't know a city until you've seen its sports teams, so go to a game with the locals. The \"In Town From\" feature on the Event Search page lets you see what's available for a future trip. You also can filter your results by sports, teams, venues, events and more.\nWHAT'S NOT If the site doesn't have info for your destination, it defaults to another city.

Prices, if available, are displayed in a ribbon across the photo.\nWHAT'S NOT There wasn't a home or reset button so you could return to the home page. Also, filters would have helped refine search results based on price.

The main compartment seems made for the iPad, which slides in perfectly, even if it's in its own case. The bag is sleek enough to tuck close to your body with the shoulder strap, so there's no worry about pickpockets or bag snatchers. The material is tough and the buckle is polished aluminum.\nTHE BAD It's more sleek than roomy, so don't try to load too much, thus creating unequal pressure on your digital device and perhaps cracking the screen.\nTHE COST $135\nAVAILABLE FROM davekny.com --MCT\n(Credit: Handout) YOUVISIT.COM This website gives you a look at 400 college campuses and universities in the United States, Europe, Africa and Latin America.\nWHAT'S HOT Parents and prospective students can peruse college after college without getting on a plane. The tours use virtual guides, panoramic photos, videos and photo features that let you see inside the cadet chapel at the U.S. Military Academy or stroll around Pepperdine University and its Beaman Patio overlooking the Pacific.\nWHAT'S NOT The tours are thorough, but nothing can take the place of actually being there. You don't feel any energy. There are too many marketing photos of buildings and not enough \"real\" photos that capture the spirit of campus life. --LOS ANGELES TIMES\n(Credit: Handout) Airlines in the United States lose or damage about 140,000 bags a month, or about three for every 100,000 passengers. It's a relatively small loss rate. Still, several companies hope to capitalize on the frustration travelers feel waiting by the baggage carousel only to realize their luggage didn't arrive. TRAKDOT , from Los Angeles-based company GlobaTrac, is a palm-size device that travelers can toss into their bags to track luggage via the Internet or a smartphone app. It sells for $50, plus fees.\nMeanwhile, European aerospace company Airbus announced last month it is producing luggage with built-in technology that allows passengers to track their bags.

No word on the cost, but Airbus is reportedly considering letting airlines rent the bags to passengers. --LOS ANGELES TIMES\nNAME Glamping.com\nWHAT IT DOES Sources glamorous camping options the world over -- from floating lodges in Cambodia to luxe tree houses in Italy.\nWHAT'S HOT The site defines different \"glamping\" opportunities organized by destination and by categories, such as tents, villas and huts; cubes and eco-pods, and yurts and tepees. The large photos kick-start the romantic outdoor adventurist within. The boxed TripAdvisor rating with links to full reviews should soothe skeptics.

You can buy a backup battery, serviceable speaker and micro-umbrella from Genius Packer or provide your own to fit in the designated areas.

We want to visit San Francisco, and seeing which weekends are cheapest before crunching numbers was a huge help. Once you click on a hotel, you can toggle between its deal rank analysis, rates and reviews.\nWHAT'S NOT We were obsessed with hunting for an \"Awesome Deal,\" but we never found one after searching cities such as San Diego, Las Vegas and Charleston, S.C. We'd love it if DealAngel let us know, either on the home page or by newsletter, when awesome deals exist.\nNAME Pixmeaway.com\nWHAT IT DOES The website has you select three to seven pictures that reflect your emotions, then suggests your travel type and recommends four top destinations. You can compile a list of favorites, check hotel rates, see weather info and get a list of travelers with similar profiles.\nWHAT'S HOT The best part was discovering destinations we had never considered. Also, when you click over to check hotel rates, it shows TripAdvisor reviews and star ratings.\nWHAT'S NOT If you're a Pinterest fan or an avid Flickr contributor, you might be disappointed by the quality of photos used for the opening pages. Think of the photos as representing the mood or spirit, rather than the exact look, of a destination.\n--Los Angeles Times\n(Credit: MCT) NAME Coghlan's Dynamo Flashlight\nWHAT IT IS A miniature LED flashlight, smaller than a tea bag in area, that is charged by turning a small crank.\nHOW MUCH $4 to $6, depending on where you look.\nTHE GOOD The instructions: \"Wind the handle for one minute to get up to 30 minutes of light.\" On a fresh charge, the light will illuminate the inside of a tent enough to play games, read, etc. For gadget lovers, this is a winner.\nTHE BAD Something this well-made, efficient and cheap can't be bad.\nAVAILABLE AT You can find it at many online retailers, including amazon.com , and in numerous stores with camping equipment.\n--MCT\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISE HERE (Credit: Handout) SUNMATE Just push a button and this tiny (2-by-2 1/2-inch) device measures ultraviolet ray intensity using the National Weather Service 's UV index scale. If one or two bulbs light up, the risk is low or moderate. When three lights go on, the machine also beeps a warning to indicate high risk. Four or five lights, it's time to head indoors.\nHOW MUCH $10\nTHE GOOD In case of uncooperative kids (or husband), you can use this little gizmo as leverage to demand another slather of SPF 30 or a retreat from the beach.\nTHE BAD Common sense may be just as effective.\nBOTTOM LINE You can always go to epa.gov/sunwise/uvindex.html and plug in your ZIP code to get the official UV forecast\nINFO purelyproducts.com\n-- The Washington Post\n(Credit: Handout) DRY DUDZ\nHOW MUCH Men $95, women $85 ($120 with bikini top)\nWHAT IT IS A swimsuit system designed to go from lounging on the beach to water skiing, running, biking, etc. Materials are made to dry quickly and wick water from the skin. On the men's version, liners that look like compression shorts hook via a Velcro-like system. For women, a bikini-suit bottom hooks to board shorts.\nTHE GOOD The liner dries quickly and prevents chafing.\nTHE BAD The extra-large men's suit, which has a 38-inch waist, barely fits a man who typically wears 36. The women's styling is made for a younger woman with an athletic build.\nBOTTOM LINE Buy the men's version; pass on the women's.\nINFO drydudz.com\n-- The Washington Post\n(Credit: Handout) GARMIN GTU 10 GPS LOCATOR A small GPS device you can track via computer or smartphone\nHOW MUCH $199.99\nHOW IT WORKS Attach the device to a suitcase, a car, a child, a husband, a wife. When you want to see where the device is, go to my.garmin.com or the Android or iPhone app, click to locate on a map.\nTHE GOOD Despite its implications for familial espionage, we see great travel applications -- such as when you let your teen take that school trip or when you want to track fellow travelers while on the road.\nTHE BAD When trying to track friends in a big-city setting, the GPS signal was unable to navigate tall buildings, so it reverted to positioning via cell-tower signals.\nINFO garmin.com\n(Credit: Handout) NAME Scosche boomCAN\nWHAT IT IS About the size of a small Vicks VapoRub bottle or a 35-mm film canister (if anybody remembers those), this tiny speaker delivers huge volume from your MP3 player or easily outperforms your laptop speaker. It also works with iPods, iPhones, iPads, Android devices, BlackBerrys, gaming devices and more.\nHOW MUCH $24.99\nTHE GOOD You won't believe the amount of sound for the size. And it's small enough that you won't cringe at the thought of taking it along even when traveling light.\nTHE BAD Don't expect huge bass; we just don't think it's possible given the size, but you won't be disappointed otherwise.\nMORE INFO scosche.com\n(Credit: Handout) NAME Lush New! solid cinnamon and clove shampoo\nHOW MUCH $10.95 for 1.9 ounces (tins cost $3.95) WHAT IT IS A round bar of shampoo from Lush that can be kept in a travel tin.\nTHE GOOD The first time we tried New! we followed the directions, wiping the moistened bar on our wet hair a few times. And we had one of the best hair days in years. Because it's a solid, the shampoo is a natural for carrying in lieu of a liquid that bothers the Transportation Security Administration\nTHE BAD You cannot place the wet shampoo bar in its tin or let it lie flat without having it adhere to a surface. Mop excess moisture with a towel, then let it dry for half an hour standing on its edge.\nMORE INFO lushusa.com\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISE HERE (Credit: Handout) NAME Garmin Approach S3\nHOW MUCH $349.99\nWHAT IT IS A GPS device in a watch for golfers. It enables players to determine their distance to the hole and the shape of the green, and to keep score all in a watch with a touch-screen face that looks sporty; comes loaded with more than 27,000 golf courses around the world.\nTHE GOOD An alternative for golfers playing a course without GPS carts or a handheld GPS device, a watch with GPS capabilities -- and Garmin says this is the first touch-screen GPS watch for golf -- is very handy, indeed.\nTHE BAD It's a watch, so the screen is small, though yardage numbers are fairly large. It still won't help your swing.\nMORE INFO garmin.com\n(Credit: Handout) WHAT The Callet\nHOW MUCH $19.95\nWHAT IT IS A rubbery holder for your BlackBerry or iPhone with pockets on the back to carry credit cards, dollar bills, a driver's license.\nTHE GOOD Its no-nonsense design quickly slips over your phone for a snug fit, and it's available in four colors: black, blue, pink and white. Tuck in your money clip, ID, credit cards, mass-transit pass and hotel key for a less bulky way to get around on vacation. You've just reduced your Big 3 items -- phone, wallet and key -- to one out-of-the-way solution.\nTHE BAD It looks cheap and doesn't come with a transparent cover to protect your phone's screen. It's not intended to absorb shock.\nAVAILABLE FROM thecallet.com\n(Credit: Handout) NAME Trip Doc\nCOST $2.99\nAVAILABLE FOR iPhone , iPod touch , iPad\nWHAT IT DOES Gives you a place to store travel recommendations for restaurants, hotels, activities, airports; plus museum, bus, train locations\nWHAT'S HOT This app was just what we needed, as family members and friends were emailing us suggestions for our upcoming family reunion in Oahu , Hawaii. We usually use Travel Muse for a day-by-day itinerary, but in this case, we weren't going to decide what to do until after we arrived.\nWHAT'S NOT As we loaded the suggestions via the website (and using the restaurant, activity and other categories), they showed up on the map as the same red pin. It would be nice if each category had its own color or themed icon.\nWORTH IT Great for planning must-see spots.\n(Credit: Handout) WHAT Lorex Live Connect home-monitoring system\nCOST $299 on the Lorex website, but, as always, shop around.\nWHAT IT IS An easy-to-use camera system that works wirelessly through your Internet router to let you see what's going on at home from anywhere in the world through a free Skype account.\nTHE GOOD The wireless camera communicates with the base unit. You must create two Skype accounts, or just one if you already have an account. You then \"call\" that second account (which is your Lorex camera) through your first account and you have a security window into your home\nTHE BAD What you miss compared with more sophisticated systems is motion-detected recording capability, which you'd want, say, in a court case against a burglar.\nINFO lorextechnology.com or 888-425-6739\n(Credit: Handout) WHAT P-cubed pants\nHOW MUCH $99.95 for the business traveler version (khaki or brown); $109.95 for the adventure pants (green or gray)\nWHAT THEY ARE Adventure and business pants from Clothing Arts of North Woodmere that are pickpocket-proof\nHOW THEY WORK Large pockets with zippers and buttons make unauthorized access difficult, if not impossible. The front pockets not only are zippered, but each has a button flap for extra security.\nTHE GOOD Loaded up with a water bottle, reporter's notebook, wallet, two mobile phones, pens, checkbook, cash and change, they were comfortable and not clown-pants bulgy.\nTHE BAD So much storage room, you might have trouble remembering where you stashed your stuff.\nMORE INFO 516-639-0937, clothingarts.com\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISE HERE (Credit: Handout) WHAT Travalo Excel\nHOW MUCH $20\nWHAT IT IS A refillable aluminum spray container for traveling with your favorite scent without risking confiscation by the Transportation Security Administration .\nHOW IT WORKS Pull the atomizer tip off the spray bottle of your perfume or cologne, place the Travalo fill valve against the bottle's exit tube and push down repeatedly until the Travalo is loaded.\nTHE GOOD It's about the size of a lipstick, so you won't be adding to your baggage burden.\nTHE BAD If your perfume or cologne isn't in a spray bottle, there's no way to get it into the Travalo unless you transfer it to some kind of spray bottle that will mate with the Travalo.\nMORE INFO travalo.com\n(Credit: Handout) WHAT CordCruncher Headphones, earbuds whose wires are sheathed in a hypoallergenic elastic tube that keeps the wires from tangling\nHOW MUCH $20-$30\nWHAT THEY DO When not in use, the wires are recessed in the sheath. To use the earbuds, hold the jack end in one hand, the buds in the other and pull the wires to extend them out of the sheath -- as long as 3 1/2 feet. When done, hold each end of the sheath and stretch. The wires retreat back into the sheath.\nWHAT'S HOT They are perfect for a traveler or commuter.\nWHAT'S NOT You can't expect huge sound, but you can expect good sound.\nMORE INFO cordcruncher.com\n(Credit: Handout) NAME BlackTomato.com\nWHAT IT DOES This website -- using travel photos as a gateway -- creates tailor-made trips and adventures for such things as a 10-night trip cycling the Himalayas or a private wine and truffle tasting at a fine restaurant in Milan.\nWHAT'S HOT Go to the \"Browse by Need\" section and you'll have fun spinning the wheel of suggestion. Enter the month you'd like to travel, select the reason for your trip -- a retreat, a honeymoon -- and see where Black Tomato takes you.\nWHAT'S NOT The trips are so customized that not all have a full itinerary or cost. Many offer suggestions that ask you to call for more details. Annoying, but the travel ideas they do highlight will make for a brag-worthy experience.\n-- Los Angeles Times\n(Credit: Handout) NAME SeatGuru by TripAdvisor\nAVAILABLE FOR iPhone , iPod touch , iPad\nWHAT IT DOES Provides more than 700 color-coded seat maps for nearly 100 airlines. Get seat advice, search and book flights, and check your flight status with real-time alerts.\nCOST Free\nWHAT'S HOT In the air, it can find the terminal and gate for connecting flights. With restaurant info, you can plan where to eat on short layovers.\nWHAT'S NOT People are accustomed to using the comparison charts on SeatGuru.com , but we couldn't find the website on the app. You could, however, sort route info by time of day and compare planes and seats that way before booking.\nWORTH IT Android users may wish they had their own version.\n(Credit: MCT) WHAT CarryOn Free\nWHAT IT IS A bag designed to comply with Spirit Airlines ' maximum limits for a personal bag, thus avoiding fees. It comes in black and three colored patterns, and is made of polyurethane or polyester. It has a 23-inch telescoping handle, wheels and a strap handle.\nWHAT'S GOOD Roomier than you might think. In addition to the main zippered compartment, there is a smaller compartment and a handy compartment in front for boarding passes and passports. In an overhead bin, it takes up less space than a standard carry-on.\nWHAT'S BAD Designed to meet Spirit's specifications, it may not pass muster with other airlines. In many cases, however, all they require is that a personal bag fit under the seat. The bag is heavy for its size: 7 pounds empty.\nCOST $54.99 from carryonfree.com\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISE HERE (Credit: Hipzbag/MCT) WHAT Hipzbag Square Passport Bag\nHOW MUCH $28\nWHAT IT IS Faux-leather bag, 5 1/2 inches square, that clips to belt loops or to a provided waist strap that fits 24 to 45 inches around.\nWHAT'S GOOD A smaller, stylish alternative to a fanny pack for carrying keys, phone, cash, cards and a passport, which fits perfectly zipped inside the main compartment or in the back sleeve. The larger of two zippered compartments in front would make a handy cash stash. Though it's attractive enough to display, a blazer would cover it. Hipzbag markets heavily to women, but the brown and black passport bags are no compromise to masculinity.\nWHAT'S NOT The smaller zipper compartment is tiny.\nAVAILABLE hipzbag.com\n(Credit: MCT) WHAT Aircraft Toiletry Kit\nHOW MUCH $29.95\nWHAT IT IS The kit features a pouch made from super-light, recycled fabric. Stuff nonliquid items into that. A second pouch is clear plastic, detachable, has a large zippered opening and is good for those 3-ounces-or-less bottles of shampoo, etc. It attaches to the fabric portion of the kit with a zipper and gripper snap fastener. A hook allows you to hang the kit in the bathroom.\nWHAT'S GOOD It was no problem moving through U.S. or international airport security with this bag. The kit's soft structure makes it easy to pack in a carry-on case. And, as always, it's helpful to pack dry items separate from potentially leaky liquids.\nWHAT'S NOT The zippers (four), fasteners and pockets within compartments can be confusing until you figure out how to make the kit work for you.\nAVAILABLE kivadesigns.com , ebags.com\n(Credit: MCT) WHAT Stem Innovation's iZon iPhone -compatible room monitor\nHOW MUCH $130\nWHAT IT IS A small color camera with a microphone that connects to your wireless network so you can use Stem's free app on your iPhone to check on your home when you're not there.\nWHAT'S GOOD The iZon costs less than its competitors and quickly joins your network. More than 100 cameras can be connected to your network at $130 a pop, so you can cover as many rooms in your home as you'd like. You can remotely record snippets of audio and video to your free YouTube account for private viewing and remotely activate motion sensing.\nWHAT'S NOT The camera is nearly useless in lowlight settings. You can't take snapshots of the room remotely. You can't zoom or pan the camera.\nAVAILABLE steminnovation.com\n(Credit: Nerdydaytrips.com ) WHAT nerdydaytrips.com\nWHAT IT DOES Offers funky pit-stop options for road trips in the United States, United Kingdom , Europe, Australia and more.\nWHAT'S HOT Anyone can add their favorite quirky exhibits and locales to this user-generated map of eccentric museums and pit stops. It's global, so you could plan a trip to Jaipur, India , around a visit to the Jantar Mantar, a collection of architectural astrological instruments, or travel to Arcachon, France, to see the tallest sand dune in Europe.\nWHAT'S NOT The site is map-based, so clicking on pins and seeing what's there gets old quickly. It would be nice if you could navigate the great finds by category (even though there are a lot of science museums) to make trip planning more fun. Otherwise, you might never know that you could rent the same room at the Joshua Tree Inn where Gram Parsons died.\n(Credit: MCT) WHAT Space Bag to Go\nHOW MUCH $4.95\nWHAT IT IS A vacuum storage bag with ziplock-type seal. The bag rolls up, forcing air out and creating a kind of luggage \"brick\" of your clothing, dramatically cutting down the space needed. The medium roll-up is perfect for carry-ons.\nWHAT'S GOOD At a time when many travelers are trying to rid themselves of checked bags because of fees, this will give you a fighting chance to pack enough clothing in a carry-on for a weeklong trip (even if it looks like vacuum-packed TV dinners). Space Bag also offers luggage-size bags that push down rather than roll up.\nWHAT'S NOT Because it takes so much less space, you will be able to pack more clothing, but that is going to make for one heavy bag. And one neatness caveat: Though casual clothes came out wearable, a dress shirt did wrinkle.\nAVAILABLE spacebagbrand.com and retail stores such as Target.\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISE HERE (Credit: Handout) WHAT Kanex AirBlue\nHOW MUCH $49\nWHAT IT IS Bluetooth receiver connects to the Aux In of car or home stereos to stream music from smartphones or other Bluetooth devices with the A2DP profile (a Bluetooth device available the last couple of years). Powered by rechargeable 10-hour battery.\nWHAT'S GOOD Small and convenient, controls the music from about 30 feet away. Connects to sound systems that have 3.5-mm inputs or RCA phono inputs so you can listen to your phone or tablet's music over big speakers, even in your car, if it has an Aux In jack.\nWHAT'S NOT Playback will have some hiss, but music files encoded in the AAC format will fare better than MP3 music. The instruction booklet is printed in type so small that it's almost unreadable.\nAVAILABLE kanexlive.com\nWHAT Triposo\nAVAILABLE FOR Android , iPhone and iPad\nHOW MUCH Free\nWHAT IT DOES Are guidebooks slowing you down? Try an offline travel guide on your mobile device. Triposo uses algorithms and vector maps to turn travel data into comprehensive travel guides that show you where to eat and popular places to sightsee. There are more than 50 city destinations for Android , 30 for the iPhone and 20 for the iPad . At least 10 country guides for all three, too.\nWHAT'S GOOD The sightseeing feature is fantastic. Read information in a column on the left side of your iPad while you touch and browse photos on a map on the right. Keep clicking for more information on a specific attraction. Make a list of your favorites and access them once you're in the city.\nWHAT'S NOT It took a long time to download on both Android and iPad . The info is steeped in detail from open-content sources. Some categories were thin in big guidebook cities like London.\nWORTH IT? Yes, if you have time to load it before your trip.\n(Credit: MCT/Claire Schneider) WHAT Cocoon Grid-It Wrap for iPad\nHOW MUCH $30\nWHAT IT IS A protective neoprene sleeve for iPads and other tablets. It has a nest of elastic straps laid out in a grid, with a seemingly infinite number of configurations to snugly hold earphones, adapter, phone and other totables.\nWHAT'S GOOD Anything that's as big as your hand or as small and thin as a dime can nestle into the straps. There are no belts, buckles or Velcro to adjust. Slip your stuff in and go. Everything stays snug and organized, even when you're running to catch a bus.\nWHAT'S NOT No handle or shoulder strap, so you have to carry it in your hand or tuck it in a backpack, shoulder bag or messenger bag. Cocoon does, however, offer higher-priced shoulder bags with a Grid-It system.\nAVAILABLE cocooninnovations.com\n(Credit: MCT) WHAT True Utility FlashStash\nHOW MUCH About $16\nWHAT IT IS A 30-lumen LED flashlight with a compartment for stashing cash or pills or matches. It requires four lithium batteries, which are included.\nWHAT'S GOOD Made of aircraft aluminum, it's a tough, well-made light with enough power to use as a backpacking light or as an emergency light source for changing a tire. Plus, the stash compartment isn't going to attract anyone's attention and the idea of having a backup bill around, even $5, is appealing.\nWHAT'S NOT At 3 inches long, it's a bit bulky for a key chain. Directions explaining you have to peel the wrapper off the batteries would be useful.\nAVAILABLE trueutility.com\n(Credit: HANDOUT) WHAT The Simple Pillow\nHOW MUCH $40\nWHAT IT DOES The concept is straightforward enough. Citing the traveler's scourge of neck pain, a company called Method Simple has created a fancier version of this uncomplicated accessory for when lying down isn't an option.\nWHAT'S GOOD The pillow is 11 1/2 inches long, shaped like a football collar, with a meshlike moisture-wicking fabric across the bottom and a neoprene backing for traction. A built-in pump inflates an internal air chamber for a customized fit; it works, cradling the neck and head without feeling like a brace (a less-expensive model doesn't have a pump and doesn't offer as much support).\nWHAT'S NOT It was built for support, not for cramming into your carry-on bag. But if you have space, it beats your seatmate's shoulder.\nAVAILABLE methodsimple.com --THE WASHINGTON POST\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISE HERE (Credit: Handout) WHAT Leaf Peepr app\nCOST Free\nAVAILABLE FOR iPhone , Android\nWHAT IT DOES Lets users check fall color status by region or ZIP code, and also offers interactive elements like the ability to upload new reports and photos to Yankee Foliage.com's fall foliage map.\nHOW IT WORKS Users can call up areas in the Northeast and see how other users have ranked the foliage with color-coded designations for green, turning, moderate, peak, fading and gone.

A silicone-like part slips onto the faucet, channeling water into a curved piece of plastic.\nWHAT WORKS The piece doesn't take up much space.\nWHAT DOESN'T Professes to fit most faucets, but on a test run,the opening for the faucet was too small for the not unusually thick spout. The rubbery lip that slides on to grip the faucet hung up on the metal, forcing the water backward and onto the counter. When finally in place, the results were underwhelming -- the water was redirected only a few inches forward from the original flow. For most small kids, it wouldn't be enough to make a difference. The gadget is likely to block the motion-activated sensors common in public bathrooms.\nAVAILABLE peachyco.com\n(Credit: Handout) WHAT TrackerSavvy\nHOW MUCH Free ($1.99 pro ad-free version)\nAVAILABLE FOR Android\nWHAT IT IS Easily track a range of measurables, from how much you're spending on gas to how much water you drink a day to categories you create yourself. HOW IT WORKS From the home page, tap an icon: weight, water, expenses or time. From there, record your progress each day\nWHAT'S GOOD Quick and handy, TrackerSavvy Free takes hardly any time to use. Afterward, you get a good idea of how you spent your time or money, or how much you've gained, lost or consumed. With some tasks, you can set goals.\nWHAT'S NOT There's no way to print out or export reports (though you can send tweets of successes and failures).\nINFO market.android.com\n(Credit: MCT) WHAT Ballistic iPhone 4 Hard Core (HC) Case\nHOW MUCH $30\nWHAT IT IS A shock-absorbing case and holster for iPhone 4. Ballistic has a case for the AT&T version of the iPhone 4 and another for the Verizon Wireless iPhone 4. The case comes in five layered parts, including a clear protective sheet for the touch screen and a stiff holster that cradles everything and keeps it close to you.\nWHAT'S GOOD Even the rigid pieces can flex a little, so if you drop your phone, the shock of impact is absorbed by the rigid, cushy goodness of the Ballistic Hard Core case. The multiple layers of protection manage to stay out of the way when you're connecting earphones and docking cables.\nWHAT'S NOT The clear sheet protecting the touch screen is clear in name only; it bears a slight haze that will make your phone's high-definition display seem less high-def.\nAVAILABLE goballisticcase.com .\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISE HERE (Credit: MCT) WHAT Coverlugg\nHOW MUCH $30 to $35\nWHAT IT IS A flexible neoprene luggage cover that comes in numerous designs, which can make old beat-up luggage look not only new, but designer cool. Or slip it over an otherwise nondescript bag so you know the instant you see it on the baggage carousel that it's yours. The sheath slides over your bag, from carry-on size to standard-size suitcases.\nWHAT'S GOOD Old luggage will look new again. You could even make mismatched pieces look like twins. The washable covering discourages otherwise curious hands when you're not paying attention.\nWHAT'S NOT It may not be a good option for checked bags -- handlers could conceivably grab a bag by the Coverlugg and denude the suitcase in one toss. Maybe future designs could include Velcro fastening help.\nAVAILABLE coverlugg.com\n(Credit: MCT) WHAT California Sunbounce Sun-Sniper Strap Pro\nHOW MUCH $82.74\nWHAT IT IS A camera strap with muscle. A steel cable about the thickness of pencil lead is sewn into a looped nylon camera strap, which is meant to be worn across the body, extending below the waist. The idea is to prevent tourist-targeting bad guys from doing the cut and run.\nWHAT'S GOOD The strap does as promised. It takes a little getting used to, but if you carry a digital single-lens reflex camera with a short zoom and stick to that, this strap could be for you.\nWHAT'S NOT It costs $40 to $50 more than the average camera strap, so you'd better believe this is exactly what you've been looking for in a camera strap. If you're carrying a heavy DSLR, the single-point connection to the tripod socket does not inspire confidence.\nAVAILABLE bhphotovideo.com\nSign up for Newsday's Travel newsletter to plan small day trips, big getaways and more.\nRelated Media 10 stunning spas around the world Travel photographs from around the world Readers' vacation photos Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.
