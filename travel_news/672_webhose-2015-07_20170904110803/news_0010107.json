Did you mean ? \nMyths & Misconceptions | Top 10 Reasons to Visit Canada | 10 Classic Canada Vacations \nAfter talking to hundreds of travelers to Canada, we've composed this list of the most common mistakes made when visiting. Check with your cell phone provider about what costs you'll incur by using your phone outside of your own country. Photo © Scott McLean Rack Up Cell Phone Charges \nThis is a mistake no one makes twice. \nThough many cell phones will work just fine in Canada, roaming charges and other data plan fees for using a cell phone that doesn't have a Canadian or international plan can easily add up to hundreds of dollars. \nBefore arriving in Canada, contact your local cell phone carrier to get information about special pricing plans for calls, text messaging and Internet usage outside your home country. \nAnd remember, phone calls and data are two separate things. Be sure to adjust your cell phone's data settings if you don't have a plan that covers international emails, texting and such. You can always find hot spots and enable data use only at these times. Misjudge Weather Conditions \nWeather across Canada ranges dramatically. Whereas Vancouver has a moderate climate with not much snow in winter, Toronto and Montreal have hot, humid summers and freezing cold, snow-filled winters. In addition, evenings - even in the summer - can see temperatures drop significantly. Layered clothing seems to fit the bill for almost any Canadian destination, but be assured, if you are visiting some of the more northern spots of Canada between November and March, like Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal and Quebec, you will need proper winter clothing, including waterproof boots, parka, gloves and hat. Underestimate the Size of Canada \nWhen outlining your itinerary, be sure to factor in travel times, so you can actually enjoy the places you visit instead of rushing from one to the next. \nCoast to coast, Canada covers five time zones and a whopping 7,403 kilometers (4601 miles) from the most easterly capital, St. John’s, Newfoundland to the most westerly BC capital of Victoria. Driving from Canada's most popular destination (Toronto) to the second most visited city (Vancouver) would take 40 hours non-stop - and the fastest route isn't even through Canada. \nJust driving to the next province west from Toronto takes a full day. \nToronto to Montreal is a six hour drive and if you want to continue on to Tadoussac for whale watching , plan on staying in the car another four. Think the Border Guard Will Be Easygoing if You Don't Have the Right ID \nCanadians are a friendly, helpful lot, but the border guards take their jobs seriously and there's not a whole lot of gray area when it comes to the proper travel documents. Long gone are the days when just your driver's license gets you across the border. Today, necessary ID includes a passport - for everyone - and possibly additional papers, including a travel visa , custody documents or note of permission if traveling with a child or veterinary papers if your pet is in tow.

Medioimages/Photodisc Get Dinged with Unnecesary Banking Costs \nYou can use your debit cards and credit cards in Canada but like travelling with your cell phone , educate yourself on what extra charges you may incur by your cards in a foreign country. For example, when you withdraw money using your debit card, you may not only pay a transaction fee , but also an exchange rate fee. Dundas Square is a public square at one of Toronto's busiest intersections of Yonge and Dundas streets.

Historic towns, fishing villages, First Nations reserves, animal sanctuaries, lakes and protected back country, mountains and more are just some of the discoveries that are often less than an hour away from a big metropolis. \nSlow down your pace and meet some fine people by adding at least a day trip out of the city to your Canada itinerary. The toonie , or twoonie, is Canada's two-dollar coin. Photo of the Toonie Forget to Spend Your Coins Those Toonies and Loonies (the Canadian two dollar and one dollar coins) can really add up, so scour your pockets and the bottom of your purse for them before you head home. Banks will only exchange bills, so they're worthless once you take them out of Canada. However, you may want to hang on to a Toonie as a souvenir for kids. Children seem to dig this bi-metallic coin with an image of a polar bear.
