The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission voted Thursday to deny Yellow Cab of Pittsburgh's request to institute higher weekend and holiday surcharges and referred the rest of the company's application to PUC technical staff for analysis. \"To ensure that all rates charges by a public utility are just and reasonable, the Commission's Bureau of Technical Utility Services recommends denial of this tariff because Yellow Cab has proposed a variable surcharge rate that does not allow a passenger to determine if it is the proper amount, and because the amount charged appears to be arbitrarily determined,\" PUC Commissioner James Cawley stated in a motion . The motion was passed unanimously by the five commissioners. In addition, the motion states that Yellow Cab must cease and desist utilizing a surcharge that was approved by emergency order in January 2008, when Yellow Cab's most recent rate increase was approved. The company had requested surcharges of up to $8 for every trip from 5 p.m. Friday to 5 a.m. Saturday and also between 5 p.m. Saturday to midnight Saturday. It is also asked to raise the holiday and Sunday surcharge \"not to exceed $8 per trip.\" Other proposed increases that are still being considered include a \"flag drop\" charge, which is the amount charged when a trip begins, from its current rate of $2.25 to $4, and increasing the waiting time rate from 25 cents per minute to 55 cents per minutes. PUC spokeswoman Robin Tilley said there is no specific timeline for when the other items will come up for a vote again, but she said it could be as early as the commission's next public meeting on Aug. 20. Yellow Cab President Jamie Campolongo was not immediately available to comment. \nWant Pittsburgh Travel   Home of the Day", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T18:44:44.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
