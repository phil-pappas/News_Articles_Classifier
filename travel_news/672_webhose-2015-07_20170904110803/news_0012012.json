It should be a global priority to substantially reduce or eliminate sugar-sweetened beverages from the diet,” said study author Dariush Mozaffarian from Tufts University in Boston.\nAccording to a Harvard University fact sheet, ‘Sugar drink supersizing and the obesity epidemic’ , drinking just one can of soft drink a day can lead to significant health problems.\nPeople who consume 1-2 cans a day have a 26 per cent greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes than people who rarely consume soft drink. For each can consumed per day, the odds of children becoming obese increased by 60 per cent in the next 1.5 years.\nMexico had the highest death rate due to sugary beverages with a rate of 450 deaths per million adults, the report said. It was followed by the United States with 125 estimated deaths per million adults.\nResearchers also said the general quantity of sugar available in a nation correlated with the country’s frequency of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer.\nThe report also found 76 per cent of deaths related to soda and other sugary drink consumption occurred in low to middle income countries.\nFruit juices were not included in the research, which analysed 62 dietary surveys conducted between 1980 and 2010 in 51 countries.\nAustralian Beverages Council CEO Geoff Parker said this new research was “purely further scaremongering”.\n“The Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, from where the Quote: d study has obtained their data, suggests that in Australia the biggest causes of mortality or poor health include factors such as obesity, smoking, poor diet and low physical activity. Sugar sweetened beverage consumption ranked low in comparison,” Mr Parker said in a statement to news.com.au .\nDrinks 22:23 Play video\nCan diet soft drinks be dangerously addictive?
