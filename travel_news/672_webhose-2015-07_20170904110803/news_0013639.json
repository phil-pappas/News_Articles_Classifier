It hasn’t worked for 50 years. It shuts America out of Cuba’s future and it only makes life worse for the Cuban people,” Obama said.\nU.S. Vice President Joe Biden listens while President Barack Obama speaks in the Rose Garden of the White House on July 1, 2015 in Washington, D.C. Obama announced plans to reopen the U.S. Embassy in Havana in an effort to re-establish diplomatic ties with Cold War enemy Cuba.\nBrendan Smialowski/AFP\nRepublican opposition\nPolls show a majority of U.S. citizens support Obama’s efforts to improve ties.\nBut powerful Cuban-Americans oppose restoring ties with Havana’s government and could yet pose problems for further rapprochement.\nRepublican presidential candidates who have ties to Cuba, including Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, have been outspoken in their opposition to the thaw.\nRubio, a senator from Florida, accused Obama of giving concessions as Cuba continued to stifle democracy.\n“It is time for our unilateral concessions to this odious regime to end,” he said.\n“I intend to oppose the confirmation of an ambassador to Cuba until these issues are addressed.”\nIn Vienna, Kerry acknowledged the “sharp differences” between the two sides on democracy and human rights, but also highlighted areas of cooperation such as transportation and environmental protection.\nAfter 18 months of secret talks between Havana and Washington — and aided by the Vatican — the two countries agreed in December to begin warming relations.\nThe pair held a historic meeting in Panama in April — the first sit-down between leaders of the U.S. and Cuba since 1956.\nTravel and communications restrictions between the two countries have been significantly eased.\nIn May, the United States paved the way for further rapprochement by taking Cuba off the list of state sponsors of terrorism.\nHavana had vehemently protested its 1982 inclusion on the blacklist, which hampered its access to global markets.\nRead all our Cuba coverage here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T05:03:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
