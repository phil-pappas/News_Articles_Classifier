(Scott Roth/Invision/AP) By Chris Kelly July 23 at 6:00 PM Earlier this week, Nicki Minaj took to Twitter to express frustration that her eye-popping “Anaconda” video was not nominated for video of the year at the MTV Video Music Awards. The subject didn’t come up Wednesday night at Jiffy Lube Live as Minaj proved that actions speak louder than tweets.\nIn a fishnet body stocking and little else, Minaj prowled the stage, a calm and collected pop-rap queen greeting her subjects. Projection screens behind and around the stage turned the show into the attack of the 50-foot diva, with video feedback producing an infinite loop of booty.\nBacked by a crew of dancers and a full band, Minaj ran through a seamless set of the best songs on last year’s “ The Pinkprint ,” before 2010 anthem “Moment 4 Life” ended the first portion of the show. After a moment of sci-fi ambience, she returned in a golden gladiator get-up, prepared for some of her most battle-ready songs — “Lookin A--”, “Did It On ’Em” and “Beez in the Trap” — and her fierce verses on Big Sean’s “Dance (A$$)” and Beyoncé’s “Flawless.”\nAfter re-creating some of the “Anaconda” video, Minaj disappeared once again, only to be replaced by Meek Mill, whose opening set was scheduled but conspicuously missing. The Philadelphia rapper (who is Minaj’s boyfriend) is not built for amphitheaters, as Minaj is, and his generally haphazard set was a letdown. Unlike Minaj, though, he did address the day’s other Twitter battle . Regarding the shots he took at Drake for allegedly using a ghostwriter for a guest verse on Mill’s new album, Mill said from the stage: “Shout-out to Drake. Let him be great in [all of the] lanes he great in, but I’m going to still be the realest n---- in this b----.” He then garnered goodwill from the crowd by smacking down rumors that other people write Minaj’s rhymes.\nMinaj then returned, now with a pink, cotton candy tutu and matching microphone, for some of her more saccharine songs (“Super Bass,” “Starships”) and treated the audience to verses from such throwback favorites as “Roger That” and “Itty Bitty Piggy” — reminding everyone that Pop Nicki and Rap Nicki are two sides of the same coin.\nWhile opening act Rae Sremmurd missed their cue to perform alongside Minaj for “Throw Sum Mo,” Mill didn’t: The couple returned for an encore of duets, performing in front of a slideshow of what looked like engagement photos. Mill gave her a “special apology” for going crazy on Twitter, and Minaj was all smiles.\nAt one point, Minaj playfully asked the audience, “Can I stay all night with the DMV?” She added that she would play for another hour if it weren’t for the venue’s curfew. She closed her set with the apropos “The Night Is Still Young,” on which she raps, “My only motto in life is don’t lose.” While Minaj won’t be winning video of the year, she’s winning at everything else.\nKelly is a freelance writer.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZX4ooRsWs", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00OGPK4SI"], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T01:24:50.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
