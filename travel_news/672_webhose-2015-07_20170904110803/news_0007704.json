Management is scrambling to fill jobs as only three dozen of the 210 hotel positions have been hired to date. The hotel held a job fair Friday at Pearl — a long pillow toss from the historic property's front door. Yanke said the goal is to finish hiring by late next month, well before the long-anticipated hotel's targeted opening data — Oct. 5. “The designers were in yesterday, and we expect there will be some adjustments (to the interior finish out). But we are still planning on Oct. 5 unless we hear otherwise,\" he said. In February 2013, I reported that Pearl had selected Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants to operate a new four-star boutique hotel that would be owned by Silver Ventures, the company that has redeveloped the former brewery complex into a mixed-use district with retail, residential and office spaces. At the time, the 146-room project was slated to open in fall 2014. Then last December, Kimpton announced that it was being acquired by InterContinental Hotels Group for $430 million. Yanke talked about how Pearl’s plans for the former brewhouse structure and efforts to transform a portion of the building into a new hotel have taken longer than initially planned. “The whole process has gone on for several years now in terms of design, structure and concept and what fits where with the transformation of the brewery,” he said. “It’s been a long, beautiful, growing process.” Although Yanke hasn’t had to endure much of that preparation and planning, having joined the hotel team in May, he is aware that the development of Hotel Emma has been complex. “One of the challenges with a historic property is how much of it do you want to keep?\" Yanke said. Yanke said the finished product will make the wait worthwhile, providing Pearl with a new element to attract more urban visitors. \nWant San Antonio Travel   Business Pulse", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T21:08:55.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
