For as long as I can remember it’s been one of my best assets. Also for as long as I can remember I’ve been taking care of it simply by washing it and applying Oil of Olay moisturizer. I never thought I needed some fancy brand with a high price tag to get the results I always wanted. that doesn’t mean I haven’t tried other brands, I have, many; but I always go back to my tried and true Oil of Olay. \nOn a recent trip to Walmart I found really great deals on my favorite beauty products. I’m not talking about a little bit of change in your pocket, I’m talking about MONEY SAVING deals that are worth the trip. \nP&G brands like Olay and Cover Girl are staples for a woman’s life. From beauty bars in the shower to LashBlast Volume Mascara on the vanity these brands are part of my every day. \nHere is my first use of LashBlast Mascara. Just 2 quick swips and I was ready for the day. If I was getting ready for date night or dinner with the girls I would’ve added a couple other swipes and a long wing of Cover Girl Perfect Point Plus Eyeliner Pencil. With its attached smudger tip I get that perfect smoky eye every time. \nNext time you go shopping for your fave beauty products check Walmart’s great selection and value. As an added bonus for being a LookWhatMomFound…and Dad too! reader we’re giving away a $25 Walmart gift card. \nJust let us know if you have an Olay or Cover Girl product that you grab for each morning to keep your skin and face beautiful and healthy. \nEXTRA ENTRIES: To receive these extra opportunities for entries, you must fulfill the first REQUIRED entry above.
