There are plenty of warm summer days and over-the-top foodie festivals yet to come. Summer is when the beer and wine really start to flow and seafood of every description is celebrated all across New England. So let’s take a look at some of the best Summer Food Festivals yet to come: \nVermont Chocolate and Cheese Festival – 8/3 It’s no time to think about calories at this festival!

Foodies should attend the Beer Pairing Dinner at the Coleman Brook Tavern’s Wine Room where Trapp Brewing will team with Chef Scot Emerson to create a memorable dinner for $75 per person. Top it all off with live entertainment, marketplace and perhaps some crazy fun at Okemo’s Adventure Zone, and it promises to be a super weekend adventure. \nStowe Brewers Festival – 8/14 to 8/15 This is not only promises to be a great craft brew festival, but organizers plan to make their mark by producing the most environmentally and community-conscious brewers festival in the country.
