As I write though the transfer has not been completed. I now realise that there’s only one worse experience than being a Scottish Power customer. That is attempting to leave it. JC, Somerset Struggling to untie the knot with Scottish Power can be an irksome process as other readers will also testify. You have separate meters for gas, electricity and for your swimming pool, which you no longer use because you cannot afford to heat it. Some of the meter readers who came read only one meter. You begged them to coordinate and take readings from all three while there – so saving time and money all around. I wonder if this could be down to different contractors being involved? If so, this is something Scottish Power needs to look into. Frustratingly, you were accused of reading one meter wrongly yourself. Really the problem was down to Scottish Power’s agents who had muddled the meter numbers so reads couldn’t be reconciled. When I became involved you reported that a very nice person from the public relations side of Scottish Power called expressing mortification about what had happened. Your £636 credit has now been repaid plus £75 for goodwill. You are glad to have left this supplier. • If you want to contact Jessica, click here Follow @telegraph Telegraph Home Insurance Get a Quote: » Up to 25% discount for over 50's", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T20:41:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
