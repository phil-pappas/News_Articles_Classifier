Three months after the earthquake that hit Nepal on April 25th, and with the arrival of the monsoon, clearing debris from damaged homes and demolishing damaged buildings has become a priority for residents of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Bhaktapur, a city situated 12 kilometres outside of Kathmandu, where residents are receiving little to no help for clearing of debris and reconstruction. Although tourists are slowly trickling back into the country, this city which is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the Kathmandu Valley is still seeing very little tourists arriving, affecting one of the city's biggest sources of revenue. \nA seagull eats takeaway food left on the harbourside at St Ives in Cornwall, England. \nHandlers walk their camels in the early morning in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. \nTigers roam through an enclosure at Tiger Kingdom in Mae Rim, Thailand. \nJohn Nation, a guide from Bristol Street Art Tours shows a piece of the Queen by T.wat said to have been influenced by recent media coverage showing the Queen as child appearing to give a Nazi salute as part of the ongoing Upfest festival being held in Bedminster in Bristol, England. The three-day annual event - which started in 2008 and is said to be the largest free street art and graffiti festival in Europe, now attracts more than 250 artists from 25 countries to paint live on walls and surfaces around Bedminster and Southville areas of the city of Bristol, which is said to be the hometown of guerrilla artist Banksy. \nTourists look at a display during a visit to national Bardo museum, in Tunis, Tunisia. \nA former resident who is engaged by the local government to assist visiting tourists arrives in the abandoned fishing village of Houtouwan on the island of Shengshan as mist rises early. Just a handful of people still live in a village on Shengshan Island east of Shanghai that was once home to more than 2000 fishermen. Every day hundreds of tourists visit Houtouwan, making their way on narrow footpaths past tumbledown houses overtaken by vegetation. The remote village, on one of more than 400 islands in the Shengsi archipelago, was abandoned in the early 1990s as first wealthy residents then others moved away, aiming to leave problems with education and food delivery behind them. \nA Thai mother and her child ride a sled down an icy path at Harbin Ice Wonderland in Bangkok, Thailand. Over the last year, two new indoor cold weather venues, Snow Town and Harbin Ice Wonderland, have opened in Bangkok offering many Thais their first opportunity to visit a frozen, wintry landscape. \nTourists take pictures of Cubans flags in front of USembassy in Havana, Cuba. \nA visitor reacts as he visits the Salle des Fetes at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris. The national museum of the Musee d'Orsay opened in December 1986 and it displays collections of art from the period 1848 to 1914. France has been the world's most visited country since the 1980's, welcoming 84 million tourists last year. \nPeople travel in cable cars in La Paz. Bolivia already has the largest urban cable car system in the world. Now the booming country is tripling the size of the network and will soon have nine lines whizzing above the administrative capital of La Paz. \nVisitors at the Musee d'Orsay are seen in silhouette as they look behind a giant clock face at the former Orsay railway station, in Paris, Franc. \nTourists stand in front of the Parthenon temple as they visit the archaeological site of the Acropolis hill in Athens, Greece. \nPeople relax at the beach during a hot summer day in Benidorm, Spain. \nTourists react to a flock of pigeons as they visit Parque de las Palomas in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico may sport palm trees, pristine beaches and glorious weather but its tourism industry is losing out to rival Caribbean islands - and that is holding the US territory back at a time when its deeply troubled economy most needs a fillip. Hoteliers blame a variety of issues for Puerto Rico lagging in both the growth of visitors and hotel rooms: mandatory staff perks, high construction and electricity costs, as well as plenty of red tape. \nA giant yellow bicycle is seen on a hill during the 18th stage of the 102nd Tour de France cycling race from Gap to Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne in the French Alps. \nSwimmers walk with their floats on a beach covered by algae, in Qingdao, Shandong province, China. \nChildren laugh as they swim with floats at the seashore covered by algae, in Qingdao, Shandong province, China. \nTourists take a \"selfie\" in front of the Moulin Rouge cabaret in Paris, France. \nAn ethnic Yao minority woman twines her long hair near a creek, in Huangluo village of Guilin, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. The village, known for the long hair of its female residents, attracts about 80,000 tourists a year. More than 80 women in the village have hair longer than 1.4 metres, with the longest reaching 2.2 metres, according to local media.
