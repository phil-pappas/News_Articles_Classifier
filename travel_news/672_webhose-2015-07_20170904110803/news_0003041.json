In the fuzzy black-and-white image, his face is frozen in time, teeth bared in what looks like a roar of total effort as he heaves a barbell stacked with massive plates overhead.\nTwo years after the photo was taken Hatem, then called Ossim, was a starter on the Washington Huskies’ defensive line when the team won the 2001 Rose Bowl. At Washington on an athletic scholarship, Hatem quickly had made a name for himself as a strong, reliable player. Respected by his teammates and successful in his classes, he was living the college version of the American dream: a towering football player on a winning team — literally and figuratively, a big man on campus.\nYet shortly after the lights went out on his final game in college, Hatem’s life took an unexpected turn. The result was a transformation that not only brought Hatem to a new calling but changed the way he looked at the country of his birth, and showed him the dark side of the culture in which he grew up.\nMost Read Stories Mariners’ triple play hadn’t been seen since 1955 Seattle police officer faces firing over arrest of man carrying golf club 5 things you should know about Microsoft’s Windows 10 Before getting the ax, Steve Sandmeyer show was scraping by Seattle’s Panama Hotel deemed a National Treasure Now 35, Hatem looks different from the football player he once was. Although still tall and broad-shouldered, his cheeks have rounded a bit, and he has a thick beard. Standing in front of a smattering of students in a muggy classroom on the UW campus, he wears a long olive tunic, called a thobe, and a white skullcap.\n“Salaam alaykum,” he says to the students. Then the Iowa-born Hatem breaks into a flowing Arabic prayer.\nIn an hourlong informal class, Hatem talks with the students about everything from oral hygiene to how to compare large and small sins.\nIn the same booming voice that once shouted across the football field, he reads suras from the Quran and explains how a good human is, in a sense, better than an angel in Islam (because humans have to overcome base desires such as lust, a struggle angels don’t have to face).\nInstead of the life of a football star, Hatem found another place in the world: as a religious guide and teacher in Seattle’s Muslim community.\n“Formidable” on field The American dream began early for Hatem. Before being recruited to UW, he was a high-school standout who lettered not only in football, but twice in basketball and three times in track, and he finished third in the state in the shot put. His hometown paper, the Spokane Spokesman-Review, described the 6-foot-3 Hatem as “formidable” and “a defensive stalwart” who anchored his high-school team. At UW his playing weight was listed as 285 pounds.\n“He had all the qualities you’re looking for,” said Randy Hart, who coached the Huskies’ defensive line from 1987 to 2008 and now coaches at Stanford.\n“When you first go away to college, you’re 18 years old and away from home for the first time, you can make some foolish young mistakes, but this kid didn’t. He was very mature,” Hart added. “He did everything right.”\nThe future looked bright, and Hatem even thought about leaving school early to turn pro. Then, one morning soon after the Rose Bowl game, Hatem woke up with severe chest pain. Soon he was on the floor in his bathroom, barely able to breathe.\nAfter the pain subsided, doctors found the cause: three blood clots in his lungs. Because more clots could form at any time, he was put on a prescription blood thinner called Coumadin. And though the drug would save him from more clots, it came with a risk of uncontrolled bleeding that made even routine football injuries potentially lethal.\n“If I got a concussion,” Hatem said he was told, “I would bleed to death.”\nThe consensus was that Hatem should probably not play football again, and at least sit out for a year.\n“I thought my life was over,” Hatem says.\nAsking big questions After his diagnosis, Hatem considered a comeback but decided the health risk was too great. Instead of getting back on the field, he spent his final year in college asking himself big questions. The year after he graduated, he returned to Spokane, and there he had the experience that sealed his fate — a dream that made him realize religion was his calling.\n“I’m not sure it even was a dream, because it was so real,” Hatem said. “It was the realest thing I have ever experienced.”\nAfter that, Hatem began studying intensively, which, in an era before YouTube, meant reading books and watching and re-watching any videos he could find. In 2004, a year after graduating from UW and still wearing his Rose Bowl ring, he followed his younger brother to a language-and-religious-study program in Yemen. His brother went home after a year, but Hatem stayed.\nHatem came home seven years later, not to football or a corporate job, but to a role as a sheikh in Seattle’s Muslim community, and eventually as executive director of Mihraab, a nonprofit Seattle Muslim outreach group.\nAlthough often misused, in Arabic the word sheikh is an informal title bestowed on men (there is a feminine counterpart — sheikhs) considered learned and respected in a community. It can also refer to someone who takes on religious responsibilities at a mosque but is not the leader of the congregation, similar to the role of a Christian deacon.\nFor Hatem, along with leading classes on the Quran, the role means everything from teaching Tajweed — the traditional song-like recitation of the Quran from memory — to organizing youth camps and performing marriage ceremonies. He also gave advice on Quranic tradition and acted as a hospital and prison chaplain.\n“I find him very wise,” says Fazal Hassan, imam or head of the Islamic Center of the Eastside, commonly called the Bellevue Mosque. Hatem gives classes there and sometimes leads the most important prayer of the Muslim week, called jummah.\nAs a Muslim born in America, Hassan says, Hatem is especially talented at connecting with youth because he understands both the culture they grew up in and the religion around which the community is built.\nNew perspectives Yet, Hatem says, the same transformation that defined who he is today also showed him a new side of the culture in which he was raised.\nGrowing up, Hatem says, his family was Muslim but not strictly religious. As a teenager, when people heard his name they inevitably asked questions and even teased him, but his size and success in sports insulated him from any taunts that came his way. And with light olive skin, the third-generation Iowa native was almost always able to pass as white.\nIn college, the experience evolved to include hazing and pranks that singled out his ethnicity, and questions about whether he was a Muslim. But again his light skin and athletic prowess blunted the worst of it.\n“I grew up like any other American kid,” Hatem says. “I fit in very well.”\nThen, after seven years abroad, he stepped off the plane in JFK International Airport in New York.\n“The culture shock was huge.”\nThough he had been a practicing Muslim throughout his life and had even begun to wear a small beard after college, in Yemen, he began wearing traditional Islamic clothing — the long, loose thobe and a skullcap called a kufi — and a thick beard. For the first time, Hatem says, “I was obviously, publicly a Muslim.”\nWith the transformation came a change in how he was treated. Wherever he went, people stared. Derogatory comments and racial slurs began, too. Suddenly some people, Hatem says, seemed to think it was “their patriotic duty and their right to free speech to call me a terrorist, or Al Qaida or ISIS or camel jockey or towel-head.”\nThe remarks forced Hatem to become conscious of what he describes as layers of privilege — as someone who could pass for white, as an elite athlete, and even as a man — and how it felt to have them taken away.\nDescribing the change, a wry humor creeps in around the edges of Hatem’s stories. It comes as a dry laugh about being told, as a Cedar Rapids native, to “go back home.”\nOr a chuckle over finally realizing how deeply the stereotypes of Muslims run, when he caught himself looking nervously at a man dressed in Islamic clothing on an airplane, only to suddenly remember he was dressed the same way.\nYet, after the humor runs dry, it is replaced by a different sound in his voice — something more like sadness.\n“I don’t see myself as being different. I see myself as like that same little American kid I always was,” Hatem says. “But I know I’m different when I see people looking at me differently.”\nToday, Hatem says, he’ll still throw a football around now and then, especially with kids in his programs — and he’s still a Huskies fan, of course — but his priorities have changed. Where before he wanted to be accepted by others, now Hatem says he tries to focus on being accepted by God and doing what he sees as God’s work in his community.\nHis conception of that work has changed, too. Along with the classes, the teaching and the ministering, Hatem says he now sees the way he dresses and the way he acts toward others outside of his faith as a mission to break down stereotypes about Muslims.\nIt’s not everybody, or even the majority, especially in liberal Seattle, but it’s still enough to make the towering ex-football player just a little nervous when he goes out.\n“It needs a lot of work,” Hatem says. “Because there’s a lot of Muslims who don’t feel comfortable, secure, accepted and safe in this society and culture yet.”\nFor Qasim Hatem, that means it’s still enough to be a mission.\nTom James is a writer, photographer and a senior in the University of Washington’s journalism program, with a second major in International Relations.
