Posted: 07/22/2015 | Edited: 2 minutes ago File photo. | Joe Shlabotnik/Flickr \nPORTLAND, Maine (AP) â€” A Maine brewer is offering a quicker way to consume two of the state's summertime staples: beer and lobster. \nOxbow Brewing is serving up beer brewed with live Maine lobsters and a dash of sea salt. \nBrewmaster Tim Adams says the lobsters were placed in a mesh bag and suspended in a kettle full of boiling wort during the brewing process. He says the lobsters add a subtle brininess and sweetness that lobster fans will recognize. \nThe beer is a saison (say-ZAHN')-style beer brewed in collaboration with a brewery in Parma, Italy. It is 4.5 percent alcohol by volume and is available on a limited basis. The beer became available this summer. \nAdams says the lobsters that were cooked in the brewing process were later eaten.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T20:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T20:49:16.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
