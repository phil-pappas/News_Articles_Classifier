Hexagon ... An industry supplier has patented a new seating arrangement that would see passengers facing each other during flight. Picture: Zosiac Seats France Source: Supplied \nAS if flying economy wasn’t already bad enough, greedy airlines looking to increase their profits are trying to work out ways to cram even more people into the so-called cattle class. \nHorror stories of airlines trying to create “standing room only” planes — here’s looking at you, Spring Airlines and Ryanair — have been around for a while, but haven’t, as yet, been given a sign of approval (despite enthusiastic managers saying it’s “just like bar stools with belts”). \nAnd with the budget model taking off in recent years, companies which already charge an arm and a leg for the most basic of luxuries are eager to push the envelope further — by introducing a face-to-face seating configuration. \nThat’s right: Zodiac Seats France, an industry supplier, has patented a new seating configuration that rips out the middle seat in favour of one that faces the back. Sardines ... Economy class passengers are already crammed to capacity. Picture: Getty Images Source: Getty Images \nCalled the “Economy Class Cabin Hexagon”, it charmingly erases any form of privacy previously awarded to economy class passengers — such as the back-seat pocket, an eating tray, a TV screen and the chance to jam in headphones and tune out for as long as possible. \nFortunately, the idea is only a patent, according to website Wired , and Zodiac Seats has no plans — at least currently — to make it a reality. \nAirlines have recently been experimenting with novel ways of making passengers pay more while flying on a budget, with Dublin-based airline Ryanair flagging a toilet charge on top of its already steep booking fees and ancillary charges — such as paying US$40 to check in a beg, US$14 when paying with a debit or credit card on-board the plane.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T02:57:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
