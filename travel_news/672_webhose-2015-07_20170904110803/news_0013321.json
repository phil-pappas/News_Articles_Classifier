And that's for two good reasons. One, Khao Hin Lek Fai, the hill that stands to the west of the downtown area, is home to several awesome downhill tracks; and two, the local bikers are very friendly and always happy to guide visiting riders around the trails they've built. \nDuring my recent trip to Hua Hin — I had almost forgotten what its famous beach looks like — as usual my local bike buddies took me to the west side of the town, in the opposite direction of the sea. This time however, we weren't headed to the top of Khao Hin Lek Fai but to the foot of it, at a site called Chong Du, the finish point of one of the downhill tracks. \nAcross the road from that spot, beyond a small pineapple plantation, stands another hill which somehow I never cared to notice. I was told it's called Khao Nong Du. And that explained why Chong Du (translated as Du Pass) was so named. It's the channel between Khao Hin Lek Fai and Khao Nong Du. The new trail we would be riding is on the latter. \nAfter a short ride through the pineapple field where workers reacted to our hellos with smiles, we reached the foot of Khao Nong Du. The initial climb was super steep and the soil surface so loose every rider had to push his bike up. Luckily for me this difficult section wasn't too long. \nThe rest of the trail was an awesome ride. In many parts we went so fast I thought we were on one of Khao Hin Lek Fai's DH tracks. Actually, the conditions on Khao Nong Du, from the ground surface to the vegetation, were similar to its neighbouring hill. The major difference is that here there is no road access to the mountaintop so every rider has to bring the bike up on his own. \nThe new bike trail, the first on Khao Nong Du, has been designed for mountain bikers of all skill levels. But never underestimate a single track. One of the faster riders in our group was thrown off the bike and banged his knee against a protruding rock in a seemingly smooth and harmless section through a bamboo grove. I won't show you the photo of the crash moment because I don't want to add insult to injury. But trust me, if you see it you would grimace as if you are experiencing the excruciating pain yourself. \nThe new trail is another step for Hua Hin on its path toward becoming an international mountain bike destination like Chiang Mai. Knowing the diligent nature of the local bikers and trail builders, I am sure I will hear more good news from Khao Nong Du and other parts of the resort town soon. Khao Nong Du \nGPS coordinates (Chong Du): 12°33’20.18”N 99°55’45.55”E \nTrail condition: Single track in the woods. \nDistance: The trail of the hill alone is about 4 km. But actual distance will be more, depending on where you start your ride from. \nGetting there: Chong Du, the starting point, is located Soi Hua Hin Soi 88 (Road 1043). If you come from the town, you’ll have to pass the access road to Khao Hin Lek Fai and the Hua Hin Provincial Court first. \nParking: There are malls and hotels in the downtown area where you can leave your car. I left mine at Velo Hua Hin bike shop near the popular Cicada Market. \nFood & drinks: There is no shop on the hill. Make sure you bring enough drinking water. \nWhat your family can enjoy while waiting: Chilling out at the hotel, on the beach or at any of Hua Hin’s numerous restaurants and coffee shops. \nAccommodation: The resort town has plenty of choices to suit your taste and budget. The rates range from a few hundred baht to tens of thousands. \nLocal contact: Call Thagoon Laokosuwan (Ae) on 089-201-7782. \nW ell, see you here again next Thursday.
