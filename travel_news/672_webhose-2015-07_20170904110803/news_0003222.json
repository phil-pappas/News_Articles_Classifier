Listening to her stories of objects flying through the walls and people putting poison in her tea, I eventually wondered what was wrong with her. \"Ah,\" said my female relatives darkly, \"It was the change that made her go like that.\" In other words, the menopause . So I grew up expecting that \"the change\" would mean that I too, would go mad . Hardly talked about in those days, by the time I got near to experiencing this event myself, 20 years ago, the menopause industry had established itself and was frightening the life out of late forty-something women like myself. I learned that not only would my mind go bonkers, my body would pack up as well. I would experience hot flushes, put on huge amounts of weight , lose my sex drive, my hair would fall out and I would probably grow a moustache. I would be bent double with osteoporosis and shrivel up overnight into a horrible old hag. For a large majority, perhaps 80 per cent, of women, the menopause is a natural event causing few or no problems Liz Hodgkinson The risk of cancer, heart disease and diabetes, I was warned, would now dramatically increase, year by year. But wait. I also learned that I could alleviate all these symptoms, at least to some extent, by wonderful new medications and treatments that were coming onto the market, and which would replace those hormones that nature was no longer producing. HRT was hailed as an elixir of youth, and there was a parallel \"natural\", non-prescription industry emerging as well. Specialist menopause clinics were springing up and many books were being written on The Change. Suddenly, the menopause, which women have been experiencing ever since Eve, had become a major life hurdle to overcome. So what should I do? Go on HRT to prevent all these terrible symptoms? Have a hysterectomy? Or just let nature take its course? I decided to wait and see what Mother Nature had in store and what happened? Precisely nothing. Zilch. Nature did its job superbly, sprung no nasty surprises and I had no symptoms of any kind, apart from periods stopping, which took about a year all told. Actress Jane Seymour opted to use HRT to combat the menopause (Rex) So far as I know, I didn’t go mad and I certainly I had no hot flushes. I didn’t put on weight and did not lose my sex drive. I have remained perfectly well and have never taken HRT or any other menopause medication, either prescription or natural. In other words, I was exactly the same after the menopause as before. For me, it was a life non-event. So am I one of the lucky few? It appears not. Talking to my female friends, all of whom are now long past the menopause, I heard the same story from each. Not one had suffered from any of the symptoms we had foreseen as inevitable. One friend said she didn’t even notice the menopause because she was talking so much. In her sixties, Jilly Cooper wrote an article saying that in her case, the menopause came and went without any of the ghastly side effects she was expecting. My one friend who was persuaded by her doctor to take HRT, as a precaution, was horrified to put on three stone; weight she has never been able to shift. In her case, the HRT caused problems she never had before. HRT pills (Alamy) This is not, of course, to say that everyone escapes. Certainly, some women do suffer very badly during the menopause and have to take a raft of treatments to get through. In much the same way, some women have a horrific time during childbirth. But in both cases, they are the unlucky minority. After all, we are programmed as women to be able to deal with both events, and mostly, we do. If I had to put a statistic on it, I would say that for a large majority, perhaps 80 per cent, of women, the menopause is a natural event causing few or no problems and is certainly nothing to fear.
