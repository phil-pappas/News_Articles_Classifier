Until then, he said he would work to install new reforms to make world football’s governing body more honest and transparent.

He called for the creation of an independent, third party led by one or more “impartial” leaders to formulate reforms. He also implied that Mr Blatter should go now, if Fifa wanted to preserve its relationship with Visa, which became a top-tier sponsor in 2007 and recently extended its relationship until 2022. \n“We want to be proud to be associated with Fifa and hope and look forward to working with them to that end,” he said. \nMr Scharf’s remarks are similar to those made by other heavyweight World Cup sponsors, which have argued that Fifa’s efforts to improve its governance have not gone far enough. Last week Coca-Cola, which has sponsored each event since 1950, called for Fifa to set up an independent commission to lead reform, “overseen by one or more eminent, impartial leaders”. \nMcDonald’s, which has been a World Cup sponsor for two decades and is sponsoring the 2018 World Cup to be staged by Russia, said it was not satisfied with the way Mr Blatter had handled the crisis, which had “severely tarnished Fifa in a way that strikes at the very heart of our sponsorship”. \nThe new line from Visa also marks a significant toughening of its position since last month, when it responded to Mr Blatter’s staggered exit by saying: “Transparency, integrity and fair play must be the hallmarks of the new administration and Visa stands ready to work with Fifa towards these principles.” \nThis week Mr Blatter pledged that he would ensure a fresh start for the organisation by the time he steps down, including term limits for top Fifa executives and transparency on pay. But his announcement after a Fifa executive committee meeting in Zurich was short on details — and his press conference was interrupted by a British comedian who threw fake bank notes over the Fifa president to protest against corruption in the sport. \nMr Blatter’s announcement followed US allegations in May that Fifa executives took bribes of more than $150m in a culture of “rampant, systemic and deep-rooted corruption”. Last week, an official arrived in the US from Switzerland, the first of seven arrested at a Swiss hotel in May and held in connection with FBI inquiries. \nAdditional reporting by Ralph Atkins and Lindsay Whipp Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
