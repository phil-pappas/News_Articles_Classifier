Sometimes I find going for a simple walk more enjoyable than extreme mountaineering. I decided to attempt to become the youngest woman ever to climb Everest after hearing a talk by climbers Kenton Cool and Rob Casserley. It was the moment that changed my life. Two years later, aged 22, I climbed the South Col route with Kenton. But now I am walking along a delightful stone path and through sun-dappled shady woodland before emerging into the astonishing countryside. Clambering past the waterfall means crossing and re-crossing the stream, and for a moment I’m uncertain where I am. Time to check my map. Seeing walkers coming down off the peak, also clutching their Ordnance Survey (OS) maps, reminds me how important map-reading skills are. The dramatic hills around the brooding Kinder Plateau are like something out of Game of Thrones When bad weather closes in – as it can do suddenly on top of a peak – you can find your way down using just an OS map and a compass. While the handy OS Locate on my smartphone pinpoints exactly where I am using GPS, it’s reading a map that makes you a navigator. This walk is not best tackled after a big Sunday lunch as it’s quite strenuous. The brooding Kinder Plateau is up above on my right, and the dramatic hills are like something out of Game of Thrones. It’s not hard to imagine a dragon wheeling in the sky, smashing its tail on to the ravine. All you hear is sheep bleating and tumbling water. Finally I climb up to the top and gaze down over the peculiar magic of the English countryside. I am completely alone save the cawing of crows. Sitting beside a cairn 1,969ft up, eating a sandwich, I feel lucky to be able to have such a fantastic day out with amazing views. Having reached the top of my hike, I drop back down the fast way to the welcoming village of Edale. You literally follow the yellow brick road. I feel a warm glow inside knowing I have achieved something on my Sunday afternoon.
