Held on the university's Besiktas campus in Istanbul on 8 October 2015, the conference will bring together both home-grown and international students and will cover topics relevant to the air, sea and road logistics sectors. \nThis international transport logistics conference, presented as a partnership between Pegasus Cargo and Bahcesehir University's Faculty of Economics, Administrative and Social Sciences, will be of particular interest to students looking to make a career in these sectors as it will combine both education and experience. \nPegasus Airlines Vice President – Cargo Aydin Alpa outlines the opportunity for students who attend the conference to combine academic education with actual professional experience: “At Pegasus Cargo we believe that hands-on education when learning a profession is vital. Students who attend this conference will be able to meet with and benefit from the experience of some of the international logistic sector's most seasoned professionals.” \nProfessor Necip Cakir, Dean of Bahcesehir University's Faculty of Economics, Administrative and Social Sciences, comments on the importance of strong collaboration between universities and the world of business: “Universities are very important both from the point of view of the academic world and the world of business. At Bahcesehir University we aim to be one of Turkey's leading providers of university-level education. We want to give our students a complete education which ranges from A to Z and we are working on achieving this. When Bahcesehir University's Faculty of Economics, Administrative and Social Sciences was founded our aim was to expose our students to strong collaborations between higher education and the business world in the best ways available. Thus the international transport logistics conference that we are presenting with Pegasus Cargo is of great importance to us in securing these aims.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T21:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T22:07:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
