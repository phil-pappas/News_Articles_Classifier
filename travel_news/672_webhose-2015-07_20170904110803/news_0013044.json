The races become fiestas for German and foreign fans alike.\nNuerburgring, in the Eifel Mountains, opened in 1927. Although it has been adjusted and reshaped, it remains one of the most demanding and hazardous race tracks in the world, with its many chicanes, curves and traps. Britain's three-time Formula 1 world champion, Sir Jackie Stewart, called it \"The Green Hell\" for the unrelenting concentration and effort that it requires of the racers. The name stuck.\nFrom March to October each year it hosts car, truck, cycling and motorbike events, including 24-hour and 1,000-kilometre (621-mile) races. It frequently opens to ordinary drivers eager to test — or discover — their racing skills. It is also a venue for rock concerts.\nIn 1975, Formula 1 driver Niki Lauda set the circuit's record, covering the 22.8-kilometre (13.7-mile) distance in under seven minutes, his average speed being some 196 kilometres (117.6 miles) per hour. The following year, in the midst of the season's pitched duel against Britain's James Hunt, he had a crash that sent his Ferrari into flames and left burn scars on his face.\nDeemed too fast and dangerous, the track was shortened in early 1980s to just under 21 kilometres, called the Nordschleife, or the Northern Loop, and had the Grand Prix loop, a new track of some 5 kilometres added. By shortening the distance, it allows fans to see the racing cars more often than on the long track. It also helps cut fuel and maintenance costs. In 1983, German driver Stefan Beloff driving a Porsche 956 set the short loop's average speed record at 201.7 kilometres (125 miles) per hour.\nOver 500 drivers in some 160 cars entered a recent spectacular 24-hour race on the long loop that winds around the foot of the ruins of a medieval castle, but only half of them crossed the finish line, in a show of endurance and determination.\nThe track and the adjacent tiny town of Nuerburg offer many other attractions, dedicated to entire families: a museum of the circuit's history, with some celebrated cars and trucks, a carting track, race simulators and exhibitions and shops related to motor sports. Sitting atop a hill, a stone tower of a medieval castle reveals a breathtaking panorama of the wooded mountains, the track centre and the town.\n___\nIf You Go...\nNUERBURGRING: Car racing track in Nuerburg, Germany; http://www.nuerburgring.de/en/home.html .
