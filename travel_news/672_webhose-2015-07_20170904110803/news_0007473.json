There are travellers on board with young children. Please do not swear. Thank you.'\nBut it appears many of those on board were keen to get the party started even before they had set foot in the haven for raving, that hosts clubs such as Amnesia, Space and Pacha.\nAnd of course phones were at the ready to record the impromptu rave.\nRELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next What crisis?

Share this article Share The video has been 'liked' by thousands of people on Facebook.\nOpinion appears to be split as to whether the behaviour was inappropriate, judging by comments on the social-networking website.\nA user named Robert Quote: : 'Scumbag behaviour... what about the other passengers?'\nRyan Scott added: 'Ban kids from Ibiza flights!'\nThe actions prompted the cabin crew to warn those on board to stay quiet and not to swear\nEmma Kivell was similarly unimpressed with the actions on board, writing: 'Put everyone's safety at risk cos they think it's funny.'\nAnd there was no doubt which side of the fence Toni Everson was on, adding: 'One thing to go on holiday and have a laugh, but there's families on the flight you can clearly hear the flight attendants trying to control the crowd. Just rude, immature idiots with no manners.'\nHowever, some saw the funny side of a mass chorus, despite the cabin crew resorting to special announcements to tone down the noise.\nTrudy Gourlay, who was apparently on the flight, writes: 'I loved the Ibiza flight. Kept me amused the whole way. It's only banter.'\nAnd Adam Murray said: 'On the way out this is how it should be.'", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1JbBALV"], "published": "2015-07-20T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T18:06:27.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
