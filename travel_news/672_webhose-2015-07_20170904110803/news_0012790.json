So were the alpacas and vicuñas whose silhouettes occasionally interrupt the deep orange sunsets that reflect off the calm waters of Lake Titicaca . They were all but obliterated from this island by water-gobbling eucalyptus trees native to Australia that made it uninhabitable for both plants and people. The flowers are resolutely back, in no small part because of Martha Giraldo, who became the island’s steward for nearly two decades after buying it in 1988, cleared the trees to make way for native species, cleaned the rubbish that washed ashore and built a solar-powered hotel. This spring, after a nearly decade-long absence — during which one of the few hotels in the middle of the lake was run by Casa Andina, Peru’s largest hospitality chain — Ms. Giraldo has returned to the helm and once again sustainability is the focus of tourism there. The region deserves “a country house in the middle of a magical lake,” said Ms. Giraldo, 64, a sociologist who has worked on environmental conservation projects in Peru for decades. “My proposal is a break with the touristic commercialization scheme in Titicaca.” Peru is perhaps best known for Machu Picchu , but the lake draws a considerable number of tourists who flock to its man-made islands, which offer a packaged look at indigenous communities. But the lake has a smattering of naturally formed islands with complicated ecosystems, including Suasi Island. I visited it in December with my friend Harriet Riley. Ms. Giraldo had not yet reclaimed the hotel at that time, but we were already spellbound. At first glance, Lake Titicaca’s vastness and beauty eclipse the filth that has accumulated on its bank. Aboard the ferry from Puno, the largest city on Titicaca’s shore, we marveled at the blue-beak ducks bidding us farewell from the pier. The farther we got from Puno, the less Titicaca resembled a typical weekend retreat lake and the more it appeared to be a limitless ocean. It was easy to imagine the 3,200-square-mile lake — more than twice the size of Rhode Island — in its oldest form, an ancient inland sea. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Yet the real protagonist that day was not the lake but the clouds. They were so low they seemed to be caressing the hills encircling the undulating coastline, forming a crown of pinkish popcorn all around. The rest of the sky was impossibly azure. Navigating slowly, the boat made a stop at Suma Kurmi, one of the floating islands that the Uro indigenous population had constructed out of reeds. The tour included a brief demonstration by the president of the island, population 15, who spoke in Aymara of how the archipelago has been built using totora root, or reeds; a peak into the handful of sparsely furnished, single-room, raised houses; and a chance to buy handmade textiles from the families inhabiting the islet.

A group of women descended from its hilltop and set up their textile-making tools in front of our small group as they talked hushedly among themselves. An older man, wearing traditional garb, demonstrated how a small native plant could be transformed into natural detergent, holding up before-and-after pieces of wool as if on an infomercial. I was craving a less gimmicky experience by the time we embarked on the last leg of the journey toward Suasi. The island provided that instantly. We walked uphill toward the hotel on the western tip of the island alone, the silence pierced only by the sound of mating ducks and our heavy breathing. The air is thin enough that travelers to Suasi often require a dose of oxygen from a tank in the hotel lobby. Even Ms. Giraldo gets soroche, or altitude sickness, from time to time, she said. We were almost immediately greeted by an outdoor barbecue that included alpaca and trout in one of Ms. Giraldo’s lush gardens, followed by several cups of coca leaf tea to ameliorate creeping headaches, one of the first signs of soroche. After lunch, the handful of guests on the island scattered, some to curl up with a book in the hammocks and sun chairs, others to their bedrooms for a nap.

A couple from Lima, Peru’s capital city; another from Switzerland; and Harriet and I congregated near the lobby shortly before sunset to follow the hotel guide toward the highest point on the island (Suasi is 12,500 feet above sea level). It was a brief walk with a slight incline, vicuñas grazing to our right and the Bolivian shoreline to our left. Big chunks of terrain look barren, a legacy of the eucalyptus trees that depleted the soil of what little water there was, according to Ms. Giraldo. The sun crept below the horizon, obstructed only by thin strips of clouds and the occasional gliding of an Andean gull. The sky was tinged with a half-dozen shades of pink for a few minutes that seemed both frozen in time and fleeting. Back at the hotel, the kitchen hummed with activity. Harriet and I shared a meal because we had been warned to eat lightly, our digestion slower than at sea level. We were ready for bed, anyway. Warm bottles nestled under our thick blankets and a lit stove had transformed our room into the promised land for two tired explorers fighting to stave off the effects of oxygen deprivation. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T16:02:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
