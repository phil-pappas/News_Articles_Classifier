However, if you eliminated the end points, Valencia, Tarragona and Rome, the trip becomes much shorter--you eliminate 770 kilometers. Now, if you only do the three-smile towns, and spend 3-4 days in each-you might be able to do the trip in two weeks. \nWouldn't you rather ask your boss for the time off? I mean, that plane ticket over is mighty expensive; it's much cheaper to have one long vacation than two short ones. Transportation--What Rail Pass Should I get for the Mediterranean Itinerary? \nGood Question. Rail passes are more cost efficient when used for longer journeys. If you're doing the short version, with frequent stops at smaller destinations along the route, you might not need a pass at all--just buy your rail tickets at each station. Rail passes, even if they aren't cheaper than point-to-point tickets, can be more convenient though--considering that you often have to stand in line these days to get tickets. \nSo, I recommend the dual country Spain/France Pass , especially for those doing the longer routes (and remember, if you're coming from Paris or Madrid to start your journey, the pass will help you out there, too). Italy's trains are cheap, so you'll usually find point-to-point tickets the better deal. \nResources: Choosing the Right Rail Pass | Buying Point to Point Rail Tickets | Tips for Train Travel in Europe The Mediterranean Itinerary by Car \nYou can also do this itinerary by rental or buy back lease car, but you'll have to face parking issues in major cities like Barcelona and Rome. You really want to avoid this. You can, of course, avoid the big cities entirely. It's relatively easy to park around Avignon, for example. Also consider: in Summer, road will be full of Europeans looking for their August beach spot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T01:26:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
