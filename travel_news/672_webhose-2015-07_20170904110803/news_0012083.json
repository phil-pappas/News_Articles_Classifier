Collusion Case By HILARY STOUT Supported By Photo Waiting in line at Reagan National Airport in Washington. Many passengers complain that air travel is increasing difficult, expensive and annoying.

She used to buy tickets for the San Francisco-based band, Y&T, two months in advance; now she makes it three to ensure seats for the eight-member entourage. Even so, when she recently tried to book a trip to Europe in late September, she said, “I couldn’t believe how few seats there were. It was crazy.” As a United Airlines MileagePlus member with premier silver status, she used to get free upgrades to economy plus and two free checked bags for each person. Now she regularly spends about $800 on the band’s baggage fees (there are instruments as well as suitcases). She paid an additional $696 for two upgrades to economy plus. “Booking air travel is my own personal hell,” she said. News this week that the Justice Department is investigating the major domestic airlines for possible collusion has Ms. Meniketti and plenty of other passengers cheering the government on. After a wave of airline mergers, the once-struggling industry is enjoying an unusual period of profitability after years of struggles. And its success comes at a time when passengers’ ire is rising. Add-on fees for everything from bags of pita chips to exit row seats, ever-shifting luggage rules and increasingly crowded and cramped planes have left many travelers feeling powerless and infuriated.

Credit Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Net profits of American carriers hit $12 billion last year, according to a recent Deutsche Bank report. Most of that belongs to the four major carriers — American Airlines , Delta Air Lines , United Airlines and Southwest Airlines — which together control roughly 80 percent of the market, up from 60 percent for the four major carriers in 1999. But while declining competition has pushed up prices on some routes, the overall price of domestic tickets has declined since 2000 after adjusting for inflation, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Those softening fares have resulted in a growing list of ancillary fees, piled on in an environment of waning competition, some consumer advocates said. Statistics on the overall cost of such fees to consumers are hard to find, but according to the transportation statistics agency, Delta, American and United alone earned more than $2 billion on baggage fees in 2014. “Let’s not think this is just about fares and capacity,” said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, a nonprofit organization that advocates fair competition and enforcement of the antitrust laws. The issue of capacity, or seat availability, is a focus of the Justice Department probe. Industry data shows that the daily supply of seats on domestic flights has fallen sharply since 2007, but has begun to rise. An industry outlook report prepared for Airlines for America, a trade organization, using data from Innovata, found that the daily average of seats available on domestic flights shrank by nearly 300,000 from 2007 to 2012. It has since been edging up, and so far this year the daily average has risen by 81,000 to about 2.37 million seats per day, according to the group. (The supply of international seats has never been higher.) \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T04:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T05:10:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
