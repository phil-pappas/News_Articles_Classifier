Guests were invited to savour fragrant cocktails from Isola delle Rose; hand pick culinary treats from Sant’Erasmo, the lagoon’s famed vegetable island; learn about the delicate art of Burano lacemaking and admire the colours of the world famous glass from Murano. With music curated by renowned DJ, Rob da Bank, and a deconstructed orchestra featuring the premiere violinist Lizzie Ball and the Classical Kicks, the Gala event not only enticed all the senses but brought the traditions of Venice to life. Each immersive and culinary experience told the stories of the Venetian lagoon whilst showcasing the 40 acre island, which includes beautifully landscaped gardens and olive groves as well as four restaurants, five bars, a cooking school and wine academy, a rooftop pool overlooking St Mark’s Square, a restored 19th century church and the largest spa in Venice.
