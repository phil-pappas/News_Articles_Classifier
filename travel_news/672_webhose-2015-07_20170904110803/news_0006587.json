The next three WGS satellites will incorporate Boeing’s advanced digital payload design, which doubles payload bandwidth and further improves connectivity. WGS-8 is scheduled for launch in late 2016. Boeing will deliver a total of 10 WGS satellites to the U.S. Air Force.\nSource:- Boeing\nTags: Boeing", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T22:56:14.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
