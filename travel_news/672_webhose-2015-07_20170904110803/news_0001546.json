The skies opening up brought relief to residents of the town at the heart of California's extreme drought, which hadn't seen significant rain in more than two months. The community located at the base of the Oroville Dam is home to the leading water source for the entire state, but locals have seen water levels drop on Lake Oroville in recent years and, as a result, less money spent on tourism.\nThe downpour couldn't have come at a more symbolic time, passing through just as event crews made final preparations for a Fourth of July fireworks celebration that Oroville won, in part, because of the drought.\nOut of more than 2,600 entries, Oroville was one of two towns that won the \"Red, White, and You\" contest, a nationwide competition that asked Americans to put their patriotism on display and share moving stories of why their hometowns deserved an all-American Independence Day celebration.\nThe third annual contest, in partnership between USA TODAY and cable TV channel Destination America, awarded two deserving communities a one-of-a-kind, all-expenses paid patriotic party.\nOroville resident Deliah Robison submitted the winning nomination for her town on behalf of local veterans, her husband included. \"It means a lot to those families and their community to celebrate and remember what their service was for,\" she wrote in her prize-winning entry. For years, the town traditionally hosted a large fireworks show from atop the dam but costs became too high as a result of the drought and fundraising efforts fell short.\n\"The few drops of rain brought a smile to my face and the feeling that we will be OK. Not just here in Oroville but the entire state of California,\" said Mayor Linda Dahlmeier.\nThe party commenced with family activities and local entertainment, followed by an impressive fireworks show that skyrocketed to the top of the dam as 20,000 event goers watched from their boats on Lake Oroville. The week before, Destination America also partnered with the Feather River Nature Center, a beloved nature park in Oroville, to organize a community cleanup of the park and offer a $5,000 donation that will ensure a family-friendly place for visitors.\nOn Saturday, rain also passed through Waveland, Miss., the other grand-prize winner of Red, White and You, but the quickly moving showers were nothing compared to what residents endured nearly 10 years ago when the town was almost wiped off the map by Hurricane Katrina.\nWaveland celebrated their remarkable recovery with its first Fourth of July fireworks display in a decade. Residents from Waveland and neighboring communities came together for a celebration that not only honored Waveland's journey to rebuild but paid tribute to the entire Gulf Coast region's tenacious spirit.\n\"I've been told by everyone that this celebration was the best and biggest that Waveland has ever had,\" said Mayor Mike Smith, who was the town's assistant fire chief during Katrina, putting him on the front lines of the emergency response. \"I have also been hearing how friendly the crowd was with no problems. That's amazing itself with an estimated crowd of 30,000 people. Great atmosphere and a great celebration.\"\nThe beach-side event took place alongside the newly reopened Garfield Ladner Memorial Pier, which was destroyed in 2005, then rebuilt only to be damaged again by Hurricane Isaac three years ago. Now it's an attraction that local officials hope will draw potential homeowners back to Waveland.\nAcross town, Ellwood Bourgeois Memorial Park is next in line for a much-needed facelift. Ground is set to break at the park in August on a new playground thanks to the Where Angels Play Foundation, a New Jersey-based nonprofit that helps restore joy in communities in need. The park will be dedicated to members of the Bane family who lost their lives during Katrina. At the Red, White and You celebration, Destination America presented a $10,000 donation to help fund its construction.\nThe spirit of Waveland's Fourth of July event seemed to reflect the hopes of local resident and business owner Donna Estopinal, who submitted the winning nomination. \"Waveland is coming back stronger and better than before. Everyone in the City of Waveland works hard every day,\" she wrote. \"What better place to show off our determination in rebuilding than Waveland by having a 'Red, White and You' celebration, fireworks and all!\"\nThe memorable Independence Day festivities in Waveland ended with a high-energy performance by popular New Orleans cover band Category 6 before the night concluded with a grand fireworks finale over the Gulf.\nDestination America worked closely with local officials of each town to create a celebration that was all-American but still unique to each community's local flavor.\n1 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1IOteJW TOP VIDEOS", "external_links":
