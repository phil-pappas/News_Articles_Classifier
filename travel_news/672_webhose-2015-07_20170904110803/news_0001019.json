Sheraton Macao Hotel’s General Manager of Sales and Marketing, Ms. Daniella Tonetto, said: “Our clients tell us that these four options take up the bulk of every meeting planner’s budget. We are confident that the value and cost-savings that they stand to enjoy from our Meet for Free in Macau package will encourage them to continue to book their business with us.\" Meeting planners who book a two-night stay for up to 750 rooms or 1,500 attendees at Sheraton Macao Hotel can choose one of the following complimentary options*: • Stay for Free – Receive one night free when booking a minimum of 2 nights • Meet for Free – Get a free meeting package when booking meetings across 2 days or more • Eat for Free – Receive up to HKD500 food and beverage credit with every HKD500 spend per delegate • Travel for Free – Get round-trip ferry tickets between Hong Kong and Macau and coach transfers to and from the ferry terminal *Terms and conditions apply. To enjoy this offer, meeting planners must contract a minimum of 50 rooms per night for two consecutive nights. Bookings must be made between now and December 31, 2015 for meetings held by August 2016. Ms. Tonetto added: “Macau has definitely matured into an attractive MICE destination in the last decade with more infrastructure, products and services being developed to suit this segment. With Meet for Free in Macau, there is no better time than now to experience all the city has to offer!” Having hosted more than 6,000 events with 200,000 attendees since opening in September 2012, Sheraton Macao Hotel has raised the profile of Macau as a MICE destination and was recently recognized by its peers as the “Best Meetings and Conventions Hotel in Macau” at the TTG China Travel Awards in 2015. As the largest Sheraton in the world and one of the largest hotels in Asia with nearly 4,000 guestrooms and suites, the property boasts expansive meetings facilities offering more than 14,000m2 of meeting space, while versatile enough to cater for more intimate gatherings. The meeting venues at Sheraton Macao Hotel have also been thoughtfully designed with meeting planners in mind, so that delegates can directly access them from their guestrooms with the touch of an elevator button. Attention to detail is crucial, so for every meeting or function held at Sheraton Macao Hotel – whether large or small – all events are assigned a dedicated event concierge. Each event concierge will deliver a very personalized level of service that delegates have come to expect.
