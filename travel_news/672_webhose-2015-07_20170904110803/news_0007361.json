OPINION: \nThe big OE is the Kiwi middle class' right of passage, the chance to see the far-away world and conclude that there's no place like home. \nIt once felt easy to just up sticks and head off with a backpack stuffed with undies and a heart filled with wanderlust. \nIt is a life opportunity that offers so much. I myself still count the year and a bit I spent in Latin America as the making of me. \nLike many things in life, it has been complicated by politicians determined that young people must suffer the consequences of their own actions. \nA big OE needs a lot of planning, and as young people are not always inclined to careful planning, I am writing this column for their parents and grandparents, who have an interest in mitigating some of the risks youngsters need to take seriously before heading off. \nNow when I headed off, I didn't even have a credit card, let alone any credit card debt to service and it was before anybody had enormous student loans. I also didn't take travel insurance. \nIn short, I was a ruddy idiot, and had disaster struck, it would have been my poor parents who would have faced digging deep to bail me out. \nRemember that song Send lawyers, guns and money? That pretty much encapsulates the plan in a worst-case scenario. \nHere's the planning list: \nIf you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel. \nIn the middle of last year one Kiwi got run over in Mexico. \nLong story short: nasty fractures, air ambulance to LA, hospital stay, flown home. \nSouthern Cross Travel Insurance paid the $167,000 bill. \nAppendicitis in the US. The bill was $76,5000. That happened too. \nI was bullet-proof at 21. I did several things that I look back on now with utter bemusement. One at least, I am sure, left a permanent mark on my kidneys. Carry the emergency contact number for the insurer with you at all times while abroad. \nRead the policy. Know what it covers. Know the \"exceptions\"- the things it will not pay for. \nStudent debt: \nIf you're going overseas for 183 consecutive days or less (about six months), you're still considered to be a New Zealand-based borrower and you don't have to do anything. \nThat means no repayments, if you are not earning, and no interest mounting up. \nBut, if you're going overseas for longer, you'll be considered an overseas-based borrower. And, that means you have to make payments, and you are charged interest (currently 5.3 per cent on your debt. If you do not make payments, you get charged penalty interest on the missed payments, which is 9.3 per cent. \nYour debt could spiral up, if you are caught. Immigration gives data to the Inland Revenue (IRD), so there's a good chance that'll happen. \nThe good news is that you can apply for a \"repayment holiday\" with the Inland Revenue Department. If granted, there will be no interest and no payments to make for up to a year. \nThat was designed with OEs in mind. If you are earning while overseas, at least there are fee-free deals with the likes of Western Union to help you make payments. \nBone up on the IRD website page on going overseas . \nYour money system: \nYou need to devise yourself a money system when heading overseas. How will you pay for things? How will you carry funds? \nI became a cash economy in Latin America, which worked pretty well as I was based in one city, working away. \nThe supermarket, the landlord, the bar tabs - everybody got paid in cash. \nI had no need to do cross-border transacting, which was just as well because back then I probably didn't even know that Western Union existed. \nMine was a bad system, not set up in any way to give me access to emergency cash to get me out of a fix. \nThese days, your money system will probably involve a debit card. \nIn the old days, taking money overseas meant travellers' cheques in your sock. These days it is going to be an international debit card from your bank, preloaded with spending money, and able to be reloaded online with a transfer from another account, or in a branch by either you, or your folks. \nYou can even preload some of them with the currency of the country, or countries to which you are heading. New Zealand has a volatile currency, and that gives you the chance to lock in an exchange rate you like before you go. \nThese debit cards are now offered by all banks. They run off the Visa and Mastercard systems, which means they are accepted all over the world. \nThey are also blockable, and replaceable, if stolen. And they are PIN-protected. \nEmergency funds: \nOnly so much can be asked of the Banco de Mum and Dad. \nA credit card with a line of credit on it can also form a part of your plans, but it also brings a big temptation and once drawn down on, minimum payments have to be made. Make sure your bank knows your plans. \nOther debts: \nPersonal debt is a stone around your neck. It is to be avoided. Overdrafts at the bank, personal loans and credit cards are hurdles to heading overseas. \nIt is tempting to head off overseas while leaving debt here, perhaps to pay them from income earned overseas. Making debt repayments from overseas earnings is possible, but it is costly, and if exchange rates move against you, it can get even more costly. \nRunning New Zealand accounts from overseas is possible nowadays thanks to the internet, but be jolly careful what devices you use to access accounts, and do not trust overseas free wi-fi. It often isn't safe. \nIf humanly possible, deal to the debt before you go. \nActually taking on a debt to pay for the trip is a bad idea. The more debt you have, the greater the risk you carry, and the further away from ever owning a house you are. \nWhat you do on the OE: \nGive this some thought. \nMy Latin American experience gave my CV a kick-start, which helped when it was over. I was an English teacher there. Solid work experience. My first out of university. \nCostly wandering has its attractions over one-place working. \nBoth have a value, but working is much easier to talk to prospective employers about. \nIf you are sufficiently well-educated, you can even land jobs overseas straight out of university. Law grads often end up getting snapped up by London law-firms, for example. \nMake use of family connections and any right to work overseas that you may have by dint of having that overseas passport. \nAnother option is to get overseas by volunteering, which usually involves you having to do a bit of charity fund-raising beforehand. \nThere are some inspiring stories to be told on volunteering.
