While the basic gameplay remains the same – essentially catapulting a variety of birds at a group of heavily armoured pigs – there are now multiple stages in each level and new spells, including \"blizzards\", \"magic ducks\" and \"hot chili peppers\". There are also new characters, including a bird called Silver, which Rovio claims grew up in Pig City and has acquired \"porcine habits and an odd sense of humour,\" but whose flying skills make her a \"powerful new member of the flock\". Fans can challenge other gamers worldwide and, for the first time, choose their own birds to fling, according to Rovio. “Design technology has evolved dramatically since the original game launched in 2009,” says Rovio co-founder Niklas Hed. “With Angry Birds 2 we wanted to bring a level of expressive depth and detail seen previously only in a console game or animated series – and create a new game that kids and adults alike won’t be able to put down.” Although it is possible to play the whole game for free, Rovio has introduced a new life system that encourages users to make in-app purchases – a bit like Candy Crush Saga . Unlike the old Angry Birds games, the player is given a maximum of three lives, and when they run out, they either have to spend 60 \"gems\" to continue, or wait 30 minutes for their lives ro regenerate. Gems can be earned during the course of the game, or purchased using real money. \"For Angry Birds 2 we put a lot of effort into making it fair, so that you feel justified in spending money, that you get your value from that spend,\" Patrick Liu, creative director at Rovio told BBC News . \"We have no interest in tricking or exploiting our fans. You can access the whole game without spending anything.\" Since launching in December 2009, the original Angry Birds game has been downloaded more than 2.5 billion times. However, despite releasing 10 other spin-off titles, Rovio has failed to replicate the success of the original title. The company reported a 9 per cent fall in revenue last year, and some experts have questioned whether it has become too dependent on the Angry Birds brand. However, according to the latest games index from app analytics firm AppAnnie , Rovio was ranked number 8 for top companies in games worldwide by download across iOS and Google Play. \"Angry Birds is the quintessential first mobile gaming success story with their first hit in 2009,\" said Fabien Nicholas, vice president of marketing communications and community at AppAnnie. \"Rovio was a true trailblazer, being one of the first studios to truly turn their app into an empire, leading to versions on all major app stores and eventually console , merchandise and soon, a movie .\" telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T23:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T14:54:21.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
