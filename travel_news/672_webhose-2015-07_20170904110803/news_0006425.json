So here is a run down of the top five family fun destinations, with plenty to do whatever your age. \nThe Canary Islands \nThe Canary Islands have long been established as a family favorite, with year round sun it is perfect for that winter get away. Lanzarote is famous for its water sports, from surfing to banana boats there will be plenty to keep the water baby in your life entertained. If food is more your thing, you’ll never get your kids to eat a fish finger again once they’ve tried some of Lanzarote’s fresh fish. \n2. Turkey \nLooking for a quiet, relaxing holiday with an interesting culture to match? Head out on an all inclusive to the lesser known Sarigerme to escape the crowds. Offering you a tranquil time lying by the pool or taking in a boat trip, the region proivides a great escape from the hectic 9-5 routine. Featuring some great all inclusive hotels, complete with water slides, bowling, basketball and even an aerial assault course, there is loads for the little ones to do while you unwind. \n3. Portugal \nThe Algarve is a great destination for families whatever their budget, perhaps consider staying in a Villa; paying a bit more upfront allows you to save while you’re there, giving you the option to make your own meals (lots of them even include an outdoor kitchen and BBQ area). Portugal is also famous for its dolphin population, who make a delightful addition to any boat trip! \n4.The Balearic Islands \nConsider Majorca for your next family holiday, if you and the kids get restless sunbathing by a pool all day then consider spending the day exploring Majorca’s capital city, Palma. You can head down to the water front to take in some lunch, and see how the other half lives. Where the rich and famous congregate to show off their latest sports car or yacht, its bound to leave the man in your life drooling. \n5. Egypt \nBlessed with scorching sunshine all year round, Sharm El Sheikh has become increasingly popular for family holidays. By day, it is best to soak up the sun, or take the kids swimming. By night, head into Naama Bay (most hotels will offer a free shuttle service) it is great if you want to take the family out for dinner. \nSo there you have it, these five destinations have plenty to offer every family, the hardest decision you’ll have now is trying to pick just one. \nImage by cortto used under the Creative Commons License. 0 Flares   Twitter 0 0 Flares × ←   About Rob \nRob brings a new perspective to the once mommy blog.
