They also want advice on what to do when things go wrong.\nWhen I'm asked what or how much to pack, I ask a series of questions:\nWhere are you traveling to? How long will you be gone? Why are you traveling (business, pleasure or both)? Carry-on or checked bag? Once those questions are answered, I can get to the meat of the advice. Below are three scenarios, based on the answers given, that will help you become the perfect packer. Please use these as a guideline, and feel free to adjust for your own needs. And check out this link to help with buying the right bag for the right trip.\nScenario 1 -- two- to three-day business trip\nLet's say you're going to a convention. Pull out a rollerbag that fits into an overhead bin. Choose a base color of clothes (black, navy blue or brown). For example, I'll wear a black pair of nice cotton or worsted wool pants, a black blazer and a dark shirt with a scarf for a splash of color. I'll also wear a pair of stylish loafers. I'll take another pair of black pants or a neutral colored dress/skirt and two more shirts, usually a button-down and a nice tailored t-shirt. I'll also throw in a few colorful scarves to mix it up.\nI work out, so I take a t-shirt, shorts, and tuck in a pair of tennis shoes. I always take older undergarments that can be thrown away on the road.\nI roll undergarments and stockings (if the destination is cold) inside the shoes. I use a travel toothbrush, small toothpaste, store samples of perfume and small deodorant. I also take a bar of soap I buy at a dollar store.\nScenario 2 -- longish weekend vacation trip\nAgain, I take the roller board for this kind of trip. I will wear nice jeans, a nice t-shirt or casual blouse, loafers or tennis shoes and a blazer on both legs of my flight. If it's warm, I'll pack 2 pairs of shorts, a casual dress and my beloved Switchflops with ribbons to match the outfits. I'll also take the workout clothes, older undergarments, and travel items described above.\nScenario 3 -- week-long trip mixing business and pleasure\nBring out the larger suitcase, because you're going to have to check a bag. I still follow the base color rule (I go with black), but I also pack a dress that can be used for business and pleasure. Add in a pair of jeans, a pair of shorts, and one or two shirts that can do double duty for work and play. I wear the loafers on the flight and pack tennis shoes and Switchflops during the summer or casual closed shoes in the cooler weather.\nShare ", "external_links": ["http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/S/H/3357-1013-B0788.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/L/S/H/3357-1013-B0788.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T19:34:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
