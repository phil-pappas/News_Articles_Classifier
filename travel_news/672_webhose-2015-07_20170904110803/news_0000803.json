Try Shed in Healdsburg By Angela Hill Posted: 07/28/2015 12:00:00 PM PDT Updated: 07/28/2015 09:44:57 PM PDT It's hard to know where to start, because I want to start with everything and be sure I miss nothing. \nDo I pause at the coffee/juice bar for an immersion-drip, or maybe a fresh beet/carrot/ginger/lemon juice? Or do I go nose first into the tin buckets of roses and bluebells? Oh, but here's the deli counter. Hmm, smoked trout mousse. Pickled smelt. Apricot chutney. Honey hazelnut pate. Perhaps I can swing by the milling room for a bag of just now (like-five-minutes-ago) stone-milled heirloom grains. \nPlus, I could use a couple of chic stoneware bowls, get my chef's knives sharpened, pick up some books on outdoor cooking, check out the beekeeping kits and the gardening tools, eye the fermentation bar ... oh heck, I'll just start in the cafe for a brunch of baked eggs with forest mushrooms, chimichurri and house-made focaccia and later take a class on dying fabrics with native plants. Then my life will be complete. People gather at Shed in Healdsburg on May 31, 2015. Shed's mission is to celebrate and nurture the connection between good farming, good cooking and good eating. Shed is the vision of Doug Lipton and Cindy Daniel, of Healdsburg. (Susan Tripp Pollard/Bay Area News Group) \nThis is Shed. Not \"the\" Shed. Just Shed. It's a little bit of everything that makes for gracious living, all in the space of a modern, airy, glass-clad, barn of a building just steps from Healdsburg's central plaza. It's all about farm-to-table and everything in between, but not in the trendy sense of that overused phrase. \nThis is the down-to-earth version. \nShed is the creation of Cindy Daniel and husband Doug Lipton, who moved to the Dry Creek Valley two decades ago to farm and raise a family, planting themselves deep in the community of local farmers and ranchers. To celebrate \"good farming, good cooking, good eating,\" they opened Shed -- what they've dubbed a \"modern grange\" -- in 2013 and it quickly hit its stride, winning a James Beard award in 2014 for restaurant design, and recently listed in the Eat Well Guide of hand-picked restaurants, farms, markets and other sources of local, sustainable food across the nation. Advertisement \n\"Once we got to the point of our kids getting older, we got this idea to start something new, to highlight that path from the farm to the table,\" says the warm, friendly Daniel as she leads me on an introductory tour of the place. \"People talk about (farm-to-table), but it's always compartmentalized. We wanted to really illuminate it, connect the dots. Good farming takes you to good eating. In between is good cooking. And the idea is to do it all with love.\" Farm love Indeed, Shed is far more than a restaurant. Beneath the high, exposed-ductwork ceiling -- painted the bright white of sun-bleached sheets -- it's a market, a pantry, a larder. It's a store with distinctive kitchen and garden wares, seed packets of blonde cucumber and Chioggia beets. A floral stand -- with flowers and herbs from Lipton and Daniel's own 16-acre farm. Part educational center with classes on everything from pickling to seed saving. Upstairs, it's a community gathering space for panel discussions, film presentations, private events. There are farmer lunches and farmer meet-ups for local growers to feature their products. \nShed bustles on this weekend morning. The crowd is a comfortable mix of families, couples on a weekend outing, people of all ages. There's barely a seat at the coffee/juice bar, so we move on to the small glassed-in mill room where they stone-grind and bag about eight varieties of heirloom grains, locally sourced of course. \n\"My husband has become the miller,\" Daniel says. \"He loves to do it. He does it on Saturdays when there are so many people here. He invites kids in to learn about the process.\" \nShed chefs also make their own vinegars, and use them at the fermentation bar in a signature beverage called a shrub -- no, not a plant ripped from the back porch, but a nonalcoholic refresher made with macerated fruit, sugar and vinegar mixed with carbonated water. Chelsea Heffner is delighted when she finds a tree loaded with oak tree galls and tells her natural dye class students they are great to use in dying at HomeFarm in Healdsburg on May 31, 2015. (Susan Tripp Pollard/Bay Area News Group) \n\"It's actually an old-fashioned beverage, once used to refresh farm and field workers,\" says Guiliana Marchesi, cafe manager and fermentation crafter. I sipped a blood-orange shrub with bay leaf and sherry vinegar, then tried a tangerine version with cloves and rice wine vinegar. Cool and delicious -- no bitter, vinegary tang, just a fresh, bright drink. The bar also offers 18 wines on tap, honey meads, hard ciders and house-made kombucha. Time to dye, naturally It's around noon and time for my \"natural dyes\" class. Most classes are held on the back porch of Shed proper, but if a large group signs up, a few are held at Daniel and Lipton's \"Home Farm\" -- their own property about 10 miles up a winding country road. About 18 of us -- mostly women, a couple of men -- are gathered out in the orchards on this perfect sunny Healdsburg day. Guest instructor Chelsea Heffner is down from WildCraft Studio in White Salmon, Washington, and gently introduces us to the world of natural dyes. We soon discover there's much to learn. \n\"You can be as simple or as geeky as you want to be about this,\" she encourages, noting she'll send us home with a dyed scarf of our own making and six dye samples from various plants on different fabrics. We learn about mordants -- today, we're using alum and iron-based -- which allow the fiber to receive color from the dye bath. Dyes can come from many parts of a plant: stems, roots, blossoms, berries. They're cooked in cast iron pots, low and slow, Heffner says, \"Like making a stock for a soup.\" \nAfter more instruction, she leads us to long tables where we pull apart long stems of fennel and red plum leaves and stuff them in big cast iron pots. I'm at the fennel table, and it's fun to rip and shred and laugh with the other natural-dye newbies. My hands smell like licorice. Daniel -- ever the elegant hostess -- comes out with a tray of pistachios, plus Shed juices and teas. \nHeffner sets the clippings to cooking, and then takes us on a plant walk through the orchards where we collect more dye possibilities, some black fennel, horsetail and walnut. Upon our return, the fennel and plum dyes are ready to go, so we dip and steep our samples and scarves, setting them on a drying rack in the sun. I do a little of each, and my scarf comes out a mild yellow-green with pale pink edges. \nIt's the end of our four-hour class and getting late in the afternoon. I have eaten well, shopped well, sipped well, learned a bunch of cool stuff and hand-dyed my very own scarf. I have done everything, and I'll miss it all.

If you go Shed is a \"modern grange\" in Healdsburg -- a market, cafe, garden shop, fermentation bar and more, featuring locally sourced, sustainable foods and products. It's bustling on the weekends with families, locals and tourists, but a must-stop when in the area. Be sure to try a shrub, the signature nonalcoholic drink made with seasonal fruits, herbs and vinegars.
