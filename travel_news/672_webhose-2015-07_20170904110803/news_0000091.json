Besides Europe also North America is an important inbound market for the Kingdom. \nThe United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given Thailand 65 days to address shortcomings found in its aviation safety standards, Thai Transport Minister Prajin Juntong confirmed to local media in Bangkok on Friday. \nThai-registered carriers will face a ban on launching flight services to the US if the flaws cannot be fixed within the deadline. \nCurrently Thailand's National carrier Star Alliance member Thai Airways has one daily flight from Bangkok to Los Angeles. Since this flight has been operating, it would not be effected by this deadline. \nThe second largest carrier Bangkok Airways has no flights operating to the United States. \nRecently U.S. authority downgrades Thai aviation safety evaluation for 3 problems. \nAn FAA team concluded its initial testing of air safety in Thailand and found three areas needed to be fixed within 65 days. \nThe problem appears to be staff related. \nThe three problems were lack of an aviation inspector and lack of qualified staff for aircraft being operated in the country, an incomplete aviation manual, which might be due to lack of staff, and improper testing, which was also possibly due to inadequate staffing. \nThe Thai Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) is planning to fix problems. The Thai Cabinet earlier approved a plan to hire more experts as well as to bring in foreigners to help ease such problems. \nAn FAA team arrived in Bangkok on Monday to investigate aviation safety after the International Civil Aviation Organization raised a \"red flag\" for Thailand. \nAside from testing the aviation agency, the team of four experts also examined national carrier Thai Airways International, and Bangkok Airways, one of the largest private airlines. \nThailand was downgraded to second tier, which will affect flights to the US. \nThe ministry is also ready to talk and sort out the issues with foreign aviation authorities. \nA revised safety manual has already been completed. \nThe minister also said that foreign airlines operating in and out Thailand would move to talks with third countries over impact if received reaction from downgrading Thai aviation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T00:12:18.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
