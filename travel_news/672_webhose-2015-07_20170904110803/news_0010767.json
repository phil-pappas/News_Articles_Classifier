Explore with the help of OS maps - now available as a free digital download when you buy the much-loved paper maps. Swallow Falls, near Betws-y-Coed, Wales Distance: 5 miles Betws-y-Coed is a small village within the Snowdonia National Park, from which there are a number of trails exploring the surrounding area. One of the most popular is the woodland walk along the River Llugwy to Swallow Falls, the highest continuous waterfall in Wales. En route you can stop at the Tŷ Hyll (literally “ugly house”) - a dry stone wall cottage that now claims to be one of the best tea rooms in Snowdonia. The walk is around five miles, so takes between two and three hours. Paths can be muddy and slippery, though, so make sure you have appropriate footwear. Wastwater, the Lake District Distance: 5 miles There many spectacular walks in the Lake District. But Wastwater - the deepest (260ft) lake in England - with its views of the Screes and Yewbarrow, was recently voted “Britain’s favourite view”. Those wanting a more gentle stroll could venture on the five-mile trail, starting from the pub in Nether Wasdale, which runs along the shores of this beautiful lake. For a more serious challenge, head up Scafell Pike, the highest mountain in England, for a dramatic view of the lake and its surroundings. Queen’s View - Allean Forest Trail, Perthshire Distance: 4 miles This four-mile gentle walk through the Tay Forest leads to the famous Queen’s View. From this high point you get a panoramic view of Loch Tummel below, with the Scottish mountain Schiehallion and the Glencoe hills visible on clear days. It’s a gentle walk that should take no more than an hour and a half. There’s still some debate as to which queen declared this to be the best view in Scotland: some believe it’s named after Queen Victoria - who visited in 1866 - others say Queen Isabella, wife of Robert the Bruce. Glastonbury Tor, Somerset Distance: 5 miles A circular route, heading up the tor to the ruined St Michael’s Church then returning to Glastonbury and its abbey, is around five miles. It is a steep climb up Glastonbury Tor - but from the summit you can see across the Somerset Levels to Dorset, Wiltshire and Wales. The placed is steeped in pagan legend: the tor is believed to be the fabled “Isle of Avalon” from Arthurian legend. Bempton Cliffs, Yorkshire Distance: 1-11 miles This coastal walk is ideal for those who want a walk full of drama and rugged nature. It takes you along the Bempton Cliffs in east Yorkshire. These are the only chalk cliffs in northern England and at points they rise 350 feet above the North Sea. From the footpaths you can see offshore fingers and arches of rock - and, if you are really lucky, whales out at sea. Flamborough Head, part of the way along this route, is supposed to be the best place in the UK to see whales, although sightings are still rare. You can’t miss the nesting seabirds, though: more than 200,000 of them have made these cliffs their home - including gannets and puffins. For those wanting a stretching walk, it is an 11-mile hike across these cliffs to the pleasant old-world charm of Bridlington. • To find out more about the Ordnance Survey’s OS Maps service, visit os.co.uk/osmaps", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T19:46:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
