You can spend time together strolling around the open decks, in each other’s arms on the dance floor, dining at a table for two in a specialty restaurant and luxuriating with breakfast in bed. \nYour accommodations can push the amore factor over the top. Here are our picks for the most romantic cruise ship staterooms and suites. \nThe Haven on Norwegian Cruise Line: Your stateroom or suite is in a secluded area of upper-tier accommodations, with access only via a platinum card. In this VIP boutique retreat you can enjoy such facilities as a private pool, sun deck, hot tub, fitness area and private restaurant – all reserved for The Haven guests. Accommodations come with 24-hour butler service, in case you get the munchies. \nBalcony cabin, mini-suite or suite on Princess Cruises: An advantage of having a balcony stateroom on any ship is that you have a private place to watch the sea and feel the ocean breezes. Princess ups the romance factor with bathtubs in a number of staterooms and the for-a-fee options of a champagne breakfast in bed and a four-course, lobster or steak Ultimate Balcony Dinner served on your balcony. \nWintergarden Suite on Seabourn: Luxury on Seabourn ships includes endlessly flowing champagne, fine cuisine (which you can enjoy in your suite, if your choose) and little touches such as fresh orchids. This upper-end suite category takes the romance factor into the stratosphere with its glass-enclosed solarium with bathtub and daybed facing the sea. \nPenthouse staterooms and suites on Crystal Cruises: Splurge on these accommodations on the Crystal Serenity or Crystal Symphony and splash in your full-size Jacuzzi tub (with separate shower), cuddle on your private balcony and enjoy the fact a butler is available to cater to your every whim – including fetching “Nobu” sushi from specialty restaurant Silk Road. \nOwner’s Suites on Oceania Cruises: If money is no object, on the Marina and Riviera you can splurge on some of the nicest accommodations at sea. The numerous accoutrements include private indoor and outdoor spas, a baby grand piano and opportunity to cuddle under a provided cashmere lap blanket in your own ocean-view media room. \nVerandah staterooms on the Paul Gauguin: When it comes to romantic destinations, Tahiti is surely near the top with its sparkling waters and mysterious volcanic peaks. On this Tahitian-focused small ship, the contemporary accommodations are designed with couples in mind – most staterooms have private balconies and many have real queen-sized beds. \nGrand Suite on Regent Seven Seas Cruises’ Seven Seas Voyager: In this classy, top-flight suite the ocean-view solarium, a sun-filled space off the master bedroom, is equipped with both a soaking tub and cushy lounger where you can zone out together watching the waves. Note: The romance factor on Regent will get a mega boost when the Seven Seas Explorer, “the world’s most luxurious ship,” debuts next year. The Regent Suite on that ship will have a solarium plus its own spa (and a price tag of $10,000 per couple, per day). \nAquaClass staterooms and suites on Celebrity Cruises: On the Solstice-class ships, unwind together with unlimited use of the relaxation facilities at the Canyon Ranch SpaClub. Your AquaClass accommodations also come with the additional perk of dining at the intimate, healthy focused Blu restaurant. \nOwner’s Suite on Celebrity Reflection: There’s added umph in this ship’s top Reflection Suite, thanks to the most unusual shower on the high seas. The glass structure hangs off the side of the ship on Deck 14, with views in all directions including below (and thanks to one-way glass no one can see in). \nRoyal Loft on Oasis of the Seas, Allure of the Seas and Anthem of the Seas . As hip as it gets at sea, these two-deck loft spaces up the romance factor with panoramic views through a two-deck wall of glass. Off the ocean-view master bedroom, luxuriate in the whirlpool in the master bath. Outdoors, hang out on your expansive, wrap around balcony with open-air whirlpool.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T07:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T08:38:28.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
