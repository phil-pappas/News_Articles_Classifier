That policy package would cut numerous federal ticket taxes that could save flyers up to $25.50 on the average cost of a ticket, move to a user fee model for air traffic control, and adjust the cap on the Passenger Facility Charge from $4.50 to $8.50 to help keep revenues local for the purpose of traveler-friendly infrastructure fixes.\nThe package would keep funding for all aviation-related programs intact while significantly improving the availability of funds for much-needed projects such as terminal and runway expansion.\nThe net effect would be an aviation marketplace with more carriers and therefore more competition—potential manna for a value-starved traveling public, the group said.\nIn another nod to competition to benefit travelers, the group called for the preservation of the Open Skies agreements that dramatically improve consumer choice by preventing protectionist interference by governments in international air service.\n“Complaining about air travel is basically a national pastime at the moment, and every single one of flyers’ major gripes can be boiled down to infrastructure woes and a lack of airline competition,” said U.S. Travel Association President and CEO Roger Dow. “These problems are not just about the comfort and convenience of travelers, they’re about the ability of travel to continue being a main engine of economic and job growth for the country.\n“Congress has both the tools within reach to fix the system and the opportunity to use them with the upcoming FAA reauthorization. Our letter marshals some of the most influential voices out there to urge political leaders not to squander this moment.”\nRelated Posts Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building BOC Aviation Marks 20th Year With Record Net Profit in 2013 Austrian Airlines Financial Results as at 30 September 2013: Positive result gives optimism for break-even in 2013 Virgin airline named top u.s. airline in conde nast traveler’s 2013 readers’ choice awards Lufthansa Group increases result in core business", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T02:04:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
