HelloTel is one of only 10 travel apps to successfully make the leap from iPhone and iPad to Apple Watch. \"Few travel apps in HelloTel's space have made the jump from mobile device to wearable, so we feel this helps set us apart,\" said HelloTel founder and developer, Marc Lewis. \"We like where we sit, and we love the functionalities HelloTel offers on Apple Watch.\" Expect to see nearly every functionality found on HelloTel's iPhone and iPad versions on Apple Watch. Users will be able to: Check-in to search and find nearby hotels View other users' profiles Send and read private messages View their notifications Receive push notifications to Apple Watch \nAdditionally, HelloTel will offer its own unique Glances page with the most recent notifications of users checking into your hotel and other nearby hotels.
