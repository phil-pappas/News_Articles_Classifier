Buy what might be crucial (and get reimbursed by your airline or through your travel insurance). Then focus on what you do have. You and the gang will quickly learn that less is more. With fewer choices and a lightened load, there will be more time to enjoy the adventures at hand. \nVisit medjetassist.com \n• You’re lost: With GPS and so many directionally savvy phone apps, you’ll probably find your way back on track in no time. Meanwhile, watch for wildlife, interesting sights or a cozy diner that might exist on the road less traveled. It’s also a good time to talk with the kids about how mistakes happen and how to recover. \nVisit maps.google.com or www.roadsideamerica.com \n• You encounter bad weather: When rains swamp your beach vacation or the wind howls during a camping trip, look for an alternate adventure. Search for seashells without fear of a sunburn. Break out the board games or learn a card trick. Campers can stow the tent in the back of the car and check into a hotel with a great indoor pool. \nStay flexible. Uncover what is possible. \n• Someone gets sick: Depending on the severity of the illness, consider a divide-and-conquer strategy. Take turns enjoying planned activities and staying in to cheer the ill family member. If you bought travel insurance, review your options for medical care and reimbursement for canceled portions of the trip. \nVisit www.travelguard.com \n• The trip doesn’t unfold as expected: Some family members thrive on routine, and travel can mess with the order of things. But it’s also a good time to talk about how life will throw curveballs and how to respond to them. \nEmbrace the serendipitous and know that snafus can make for a better story. Often, the pesky mishaps are the moments that become family lore and are cheerily recounted year after year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T16:25:41.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
