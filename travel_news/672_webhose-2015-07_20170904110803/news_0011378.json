Beaches around the town were closed Thursday and again on Friday after the latest attack.\nThe surfers' contacts with sharks are particularly unusual given relatively few beach-goers are in the water during the current southern winter.\nA junior surfing competition involving 270 children was underway Friday at Lennox Head when news of the second attack reached police, who called off the event.\nBallina was the scene of a fatal shark attack in February. Japanese tourist Tadashi Nakahara, 41, was surfing just north of Lighthouse Beach at Shelly Beach when police said a great white shark 3 to 4 metres (10 to 13 feet) long tore off both his legs.\nSharks are common off Australia's beaches, but fatal attacks are rare. The country has averaged fewer than two deadly attacks per year in recent decades.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T20:47:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
