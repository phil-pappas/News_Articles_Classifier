Grand Canyon Scenic Airlines will be the exclusive provider for roundtrip flights. Known as the Grand Canyon North Air/Ground Tour, guests will be picked up in Las Vegas via complimentary shuttle service to bring them to the Boulder City Aerocenter. From there, guests will board an airplane, from which they will enjoy a bird’s-eye view of Hoover Dam, Lake Mead and the Colorado River—the heart of the Grand Canyon. \nThe airplane will land at the landing strip of Bar 10 Ranch where guests will experience a guided ground tour on a Polaris Ranger. Next, they will travel through Whitmore Canyon and Lake Mead Recreation Area to reach an exclusive vantage point of Grand Canyon National Park. The tour concludes with a homemade Dutch oven barbecue lunch. The tour duration is approximately seven to eight hours, including round-trip hotel shuttle transportation. Self-guided ATV upgrades are also available for an additional $65 per person. Guests wishing to extend their excursion and stay at Bar 10 overnight will also enjoy horseback riding, dinner and evening entertainment. The day trip price per adult begins at $324 and $304 per child (ages 2 to 11). The overnight excursion price begins at $599 per person. Keeping with the ambience of the ranch, accommodation options include a 2-person covered wagon or a 4-person bunk room. On the next day, breakfast will be served, followed by free time for various activities such as skeet shooting, beach volleyball and ping pong before returning to Las Vegas. BAR 10 RANCH Bar 10 Ranch is world-renowned as the ideal beginning and ending point for river rafting adventures along the Colorado River. Owned by the Heaton family since the 1970s, staff at Bar 10 Ranch pride themselves on offering a personalized, warm experience for each and every guest. The late Tony Heaton and his wife, Ruby founded the ranch. Since then, their four sons and two daughters have been actively involved in cattle ranching and building upon and maintaining the ranch. Today, the Heaton family owns more than 10,000 acres of grazing rights on BLM and Arizona State lands. Due to its remote location, the family added an airstrip to the property. This addition coincided with the time period when tourists began running the Colorado River in rubber rafts. In many cases, these tourists were exhausted after being on the river for up to seven days. The Heatons made their ranch a welcoming place, where river runners could go to recover, eat home-cooked meals and return to Las Vegas via airplane. Despite Bar 10 being a river rafting destination, it still remains a working cattle ranch today. The tour will be available through Nov. 20 and not available on Saturdays and Sundays throughout the month of November.
