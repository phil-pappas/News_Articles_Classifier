During the event, two PATA CEO Challenge 2015 winners will be presented with the Top Destination Award in the categories of States, Regions and Provinces; and Second-tier/Third-tier Cities.\nThe PATA CEO Challenge 2015 embraces the uniqueness and diversity of heritages, cultures, customs and natural beauty of the world’s diverse destinations, in line with the theme of this year’s dinner. It aims to promote and enhance the number of visitors to emerging destinations (regions, states, or provinces, and second-tier/third tier cities), and enhances tourism development in the most sustainable manner. The award programme, through an exclusive partnership with TripAdvisor, will allow two winners to get a chance to work with TripAdvisor to develop and create a digital marketing campaign to showcase their destination, valued at US$500,000 each.\n“The Dispersion of Tourists is a topic that I have spoken about quite frequently at many conferences and events, and it is something I feel very strongly about. Tourists need to be reminded that a country’s beauty is defined by its people, culture, heritage and diversity, and not by one famous location. The dispersion of tourists allows people to see this beauty and at the same provide an economic boost to these local communities,” said PATA CEO Mario Hardy. “The Aligned Advocacy Dinner and the PATA CEO Challenge 2015 highlight the Association’s commitment to this issue. This is the challenge for all of us in the travel and tourism industry and I encourage all tourist offices around the world to nominate their undiscovered destinations to join the PATA CEO Challenge 2015.”\nPATA is delighted to confirm that Philippines Secretary of Tourism, Ramon Jimenez Jr., who helped conceive and deliver one of the world’s most impactful destination marketing campaigns “It’s more fun in the Philippines”, will share his experiences in a 20-minute multimedia presentation during the dinner. Furthermore the confirmed guest of honour at this year’s dinner will be Dr. Taleb Rifai, Secretary General, World Tourism Organization (UNWTO).\nSource:-UNWTO\nRelated Posts San francisco travel achieves leed gold certification TripAdvisor touches mark of 100 million downloads for free app for iPhone and Android Country-specific economic trends to effect business travel in 2014 PATA Visitor Arrival Forecasts: Arrivals Well on Track with Forecasts Siemens to realign regional organization and strengthen corporate units", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T20:15:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
