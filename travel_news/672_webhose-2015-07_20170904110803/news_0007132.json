There's a revolution building up speed – and all you need to take part is a pair of trainers and a photocopier. Every Saturday morning thousands of people gather to run 5km at 9am in parks across the UK. But what is this growing craze they call “parkrun” – and why have 700,000 foot soldiers joined the running revolution since 2004? Here’s why, plus six reasons for you to get off your backside and join the parkrun fun. 1. It's free The volunteer-led, five-kilometre timed runs are free for anyone to participate in – just register online and print out a barcode with your unique athlete number. Then turn up at your local run and your individual time will be automatically processed and uploaded online. 2. You can pretty much do it anywhere Thirteen runners took part in the first ever parkrun in southwest London's Bushy Park back in 2004. By June this year – just over a decade later – there were more than 300 parkrun communities all over the UK – as well as corresponding events in Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Ireland, Poland, Russia, South Africa and the USA. You see, once registered you can run in any community – so even a weekend away or a holiday shouldn't theoretically derail your continued participation. 3. You'll earn your breakfast A weekly start time of 9am every Saturday all over the UK means parkrun hardly encroaches on your weekend. On the contrary, the early, active start will set you up nicely for the next two days. Not only will you actually earn that post-run fry-up, you may even go easy on your Friday night excesses in anticipation of the stopwatch. 4. It's a run, not a race Sure, any timed mass participation event is bound to get the competitive juices flowing – and there will be loads of keen runners chomping at the bit at the start line each week. But whether or not you complete the 5km in 15 minutes or 50 minutes is really neither here nor there. The distance was chosen on grounds of inclusiveness and wellbeing, 5km being a realistic target for pretty much most people. And if need be, walk it. The main competition should be against yourself as opposed to others – beat your own time each week and you're going places. 5. You'll be part of a growing movement Numbers have at least doubled each year since parkrun's inception. In the UK alone more than 70,000 take part each week with almost 11,000 first timers joining the fray every week. By the beginning of June this year parkrun broke the seven-million completed-runs-barrier with 710,000 runners now registered in the UK. Founder Paul Sinton-Hewitt has been awarded a CBE and Parkrun: A Celebration – a coffee-table photo-book – was shortlisted for the 2014 British Sports Book Awards in the Illustrated Book category. Parkrun hopes that its simple concept will come to exist in every town in the world. By the end of July 2015 there will be over 400 UK venues and Sinton-Hewitt plans to have 1,000 weekly parkrun events in the UK by 2020. Being part of something so positive is an empowering feeling. 6. Your kids can get involved too Junior parkrun takes place every Sunday mornings at 9am offering four to 14-year-old runners the chance to do timed 2km runs. There are more than 40 junior parkrun locations around the UK giving children the chance to get a taste of what's keeping mum and dad glowing.
