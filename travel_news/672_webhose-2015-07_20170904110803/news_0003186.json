It was pleasing to get the Joe Root decision right. It looked at the time that the ball from Nathan Lyon pitched outside leg stump but Australia chose to review it. Close call: Nathan Lyon thinks he's got his man Their captain, Michael Clarke, was actually off the field, so that decision was taken by his deputy, Steve Smith. Umpires are human, too, and there is no denying that your heart is always in your mouth when you are waiting to hear from your colleague in the TV booth, marking your homework, so to speak. It turned out that it had indeed pitched outside leg stump, but only by a fraction. It is nice to get the close ones right. To me, to you: the umpires have a jacket mix-up The other incident that sticks in the mind was trying to put a jacket on just after lunch when we somehow got our coats mixed up in the true Little and Large comedy style. Something of a Mario Balotelli-bib moment, but all in all a good day’s work. Umpire’s view after Day 2 The major talking point of the second day in Cardiff from our point of view was the “catch” taken by Adam Voges at short leg when Stuart Broad was batting. The crowd booed, which was probably more just because of the Ashes pantomime feel rather than any real conviction that Voges had cheated. Or at least, you hope so. He dived forward and did brilliantly to grab the ball, and you have to believe that he believed he had caught it. Broad was within his rights to ask umpires to check if it had been a fair catch. It was one of those where it looks bad when you see it on the slow-mo replay. Did he or didn't he? Voges claims the \"catch\" off Broad's bat In conclusion, two things: firstly, the players behaved well, and it was good to see Broad and Voges chat about it soon afterwards, and that there were no hard feelings. Secondly, some of these decisions are not just hard but actually impossible without technology. Umpire’s view after Day 3 The decision review system can be cruel, both for players and umpires. Obviously, umpires want to be right, and if we are proven to be right in public then so much the better. We are only human, after all. Good shout: Josh Hazelwood appeals It was hard not to feel some sympathy with Australia’s captain, Michael Clarke, and his fast bowler Josh Hazlewood in the 10th over of England’s second innings yesterday when Hazlewood produced a good ball that straightened and hit England opening batsman Adam Lyth on the pad. It looked a good shout on the field but the batsman probably deserved the benefit of the doubt so it was given not out. As it turned out, Hawk Eye had it shaving the lefthander’s leg stump, so the decision stayed with the on-field call. For these very tight ones, you have to feel a bit sorry for the fielding captain that he still loses one of his two reviews. Umpire’s view after Day 4 Shane Watson has made himself the king of the unsuccessful review. Twice in this match he called for the video replay in hopes of a reprieve, and twice he was denied. Not again, surely? Mark Wood thinks he's got Shane Watson out LBW That has moved him level with Brendon McCullum on the list of failed reviews, with only Misbah-ul-Haq having more, on 10. With Misbah, you can understand it, given that he has been the rock of his team for so long, and indeed you could argue that McCullum has earned the right to spend one of his side’s reviews. As umpires, you do get the sense of which players are always going to ask for it. You sometimes ask yourself if they really know the Laws! Or perhaps they are just so desperate to do well that their judgment is clouded. Yep again! Watson is sent packing Watson has been out lbw against England 14 times in Tests. You wonder if he could watch them back on a highlights package and see when and when not to call for the third umpire. As imagined by Telegraph Sport Now it's your turn to be the umpire.
