The announcement was made earlier today by the International Olympic Committee, whose headquarters are also based in the city of Lausanne. The bid was initially made in 2013 by the city of Lausanne and the Swiss Olympic Association. \nThe region of Lausanne itself plays host to over 60 international sports federations including the International Olympic Committee and boasts an infrastructure well equipped for the variety of winter sports set to take place in the 2020 Winter Youth Olympic Games. The city was chosen on account of its accessibility, with close proximity to Geneva Airport, along with the practicality of facilities and accessibility of the Olympic Village for competitors. The financial support of the government and the idea of the “learn & share” programme, a programme proposed to give athletes the opportunity to participate in an innovative shared learning experience with the students of Lausanne’s renowned universities, also played in Lausanne’s favour. The involvement of the local community and the local authorities was also a deciding factor along with the more general sense that Lausanne, known by many as the ‘Olympic Capital’, would fit well with the Olympic values of respect, friendship and excellence. Lausanne Tourism’s CEO Steeve Pasche says: “We’re absolutely delighted to be announced as the chosen city for the 2020 Winter Youth Olympic Games. The city is home to the International Olympic Committee itself, we boast such close proximity to the alps and have amazing sporting facilities here. We can offer great accessibility to visitors and great transport links including Geneva airport so I think it is natural that we should be the host city in 2020. I think this will have an excellent effect on our profile and reputation as a great location for large scale international events of this calibre as well as for our tourism industry in general and we’re so excited to be a part of the build-up and legacy of this momentous event.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T18:10:03.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
