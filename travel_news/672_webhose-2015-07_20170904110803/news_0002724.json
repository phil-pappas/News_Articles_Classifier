Either that or when picking up the forms the collector’s peeping tom game is A-grade.\nBut wait, the EliteSingles dating website (the one that hasn’t been hacked recently) has conducted a quantified, cross-referenced statistical analysis of their online membership base, ensuring the results were weighed to reflect our vast idiosyncratic geographic, socio-economic and demographic factors, with Bernard Salt breathing life into the numbers with a brilliantly written summary.\nNo … actually, we can confirm they’ve looked down the bottom of an Excel spread sheet for the selected option of “I have a strong desire for sex”.\nWhat’s going on in Coogee? Quite a lot apparently, they topped the list of the highest libido. But just because you want it, does it mean you’re actually gettin’ some?\nClearly, it’s a case of Coogee having the most densely populated area of insecure hipsters too caught up in their own Instagram feed, leaving most of them simply lusting after the perfect bonk, as opposed to actually forging a meaningful relationship with a real person.\nShepparton‘s got it going on! Source: News Corp Australia\nEither way, I can confirm that Shepp is not fazed by this questionable finding. There’s plenty of reasons we’re not all gagging for it 24/7. We’re confident in our sexuality, ability and overall randiness and here’s why.\n1: We’re doing stuff! Stuff and things!!\nDon’t you know how busy we are in Shepp? Our area plays in no less than four different football and netball leagues. GFVL, O & M, KDFL, MFL. We’ve got training on Tuesday and Thursday nights, with a full day on Saturday! Think we’ve got energy every other day of the week to get busy? You’re dreaming. Plus, the smell of Deep Heat is a bit of a passion killer.\n2. We’re the fruit bowl of Australia, not the Passion Pit\nWe’re busty growing 25 per cent of the nation’s fruit and veg. Curtis Stone could be back any minute to film another ad in the middle of one of our very flat fields! Supply and demand people! We’ve got SPC working 24 hours a day. That fruit won’t can itself! We’re fostering pears, packing them, and shipping them off to Coogee so you can bake them and serve them on the back of a ping pong bat for $15 in your fancy free wi-fi cafes.\nOh the people of Shepparton are enjoying themselves, don’t you worry. Source: News Corp Australia\nPlus there’s camels for sale. Picture: Andy Rogers Source: News Corp Australia\n3. Don’t have the NBN yet? We do!\nI’m surprised anyone’s turning up to work since we got the NBN and Netflix! We’re too busy watching Frank Underwood screw everyone in Washington along with those delightful OITNB chapel scenes. Watch the birthrate stats dive now that smart TV’s are the most effective contraception in town.\n4. On the other hand, Shepp peeps could simply be on it most of the time!\nThere’s no need for a strong desire for sex if you’ve got it on tap. We have been at the top of certain pregnancy stats recently. It’s one thing to think it, another to do it.\n5. Shepp is sexy, yo!\nLook around! Shepp is sexed up! We have our own sex shop (where else are you going to get penis straws for the hen’s night), a “Taj Mahal” of brothels, our own pole dancing club and a massive erection in the middle of town that can be seen from miles around.\nYou say libido, I say “Have you seen the Apple TV remote?”\nThe town centre phallus.
