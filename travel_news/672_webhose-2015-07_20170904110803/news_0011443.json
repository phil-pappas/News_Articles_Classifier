AUSSIE BATTING CRISIS\nMichael Clarke looks like a man searching for answers. Source: Getty Images\nAUSTRALIA has some serious headaches in its top order.\nThe impressive form of the bowlers has covered over the cracks in Australia’s batting line up since Darren Lehmann was appointed coach.\nOvernight, those cracks were exposed by England’s bowlers.\nOpeners David Warner and Chris Rogers were the only two specialist batsmen to score a half century in the first Test.\nAcross the two innings Steve Smith averaged 33 runs, Michael Clarke averaged 21, Adam Voges averaged 16, Shane Watson averaged 24.5 and Brad Haddin Averaged 14.5.\n“We were outplayed in all three facets of the game” Clarke said after the match.\n“We tried to play our natural game.”\nHere’s how many reacted to Australia’s soft collapse in Cardiff.\nHadds out slogging Ali 1st ball of a new spell Barmy Army singing \"Living on a Prayer\" This Test has gone horribly wrong for Aussies\n— Damien Fleming (@bowlologist) July 11, 2015 Australia were 9 points down half way through the 2nd quarter and ended up losing by 14 goals @AllanLamb294 @bowlologist\n— Rodney Hogg (@RMHogg) July 11, 2015 \"The way things are looking I may have to change my prediction ...\" http://t.co/jvjPLhakxi\n— Glenn McGrath (@glennmcgrath11) July 11, 2015 2. JAMES ANDERSON’S UNLAWFUL FOOTMARKS\nJames Anderson escaped any sanction for his pitch pacing. Source: Getty Images\nENGLAND spearhead James Anderson was twice warned about roughing up the pitch with his follow through.\nAnderson’s actions can at best be explained as laziness, but could easily be interpreted as a deliberate attempt to create churned up patches on the pitch for England’s spinners, Moeen Ali and part-timer Joe Root, to take advantage of.\nAnderson was issued an official warning in the ninth over of the day by umpire Marais Erasmus and was handed a second unofficial warning by umpire Kumar Dharmasena during his second spell of the day when he came on with England looking to end the partnership between David Warner and Steve Smith.\n“You can’t do that,” Test great Mark Taylor told Channel 9.\n“He’s already got an official warning so one more and he’s in trouble.\n“That needs to be well policed on a dry, dusty pitch like this.”\nJimmy Anderson walking a fine line with continuous running down the middle of the pitch.. 6 times that over, just waiting for the umps call.\n— Benny (@benny2CDO) July 11, 2015 Anderson warned again. By Dharmasena this time. Frankly, it's so blatant I'm amazed they're letting him get away w it. At all. #Ashes2015\n— betti w. woo (@bettiwettiwoo) July 11, 2015 3. WATSON’S DRS EMBARRASSMENT\nThis could be the last we see of Shane Watson in the Test side. Source: Getty Images\nTHIS is really awkward.\nA day after he was mocked for his bewildering familiarity of wasting Australia’s challenges after being given out for LBW, Shane Watson did the exact same thing overnight.\nFor the eighth time in his career, Watson was unsuccessful with a challenge to an LBW dismissal in an Ashes Test.\nWhat is it about the man that his teammates are unable to tell him not to challenge his LBW dismissals?\nShane Watson unsuccessfully reviews LBW — again 1:27 Play video\nCricket: Shane Watson made use of the Decision Review System after being trapped LBW in the first Test against England and was unsuccessful in getting the decision overturned for the SEVENTH time in his Ashes career.\nFox Sports 11 Jul 2015 Sport/Cricket/Ashes/Highlights The Australian all-rounder was trapped walking across his stumps and again given out LBW when the Duke crashed into his front pad below the knee roll off the bowling of Mark Wood.\nIncredibly, despite being shamed for his first innings howler decision to incorrectly challenge his leg-before dismissal, Watson walked up the pitch to discuss the delivery with nonstriker Mitchell Johnson before challenging the verdict yet again.\nThe Decision Review System showed the ball would have collected leg stump and Watson’s embarrassing streak of perplexing DRS reviews continues.\nHis dismissal left Australia 7/151.\nShane Watson's big pad\nIt is difficult not to conclude England’s bowler’s have the Tasmanian figured out.\nShane Watson was trapped lbw for the 14th time against England, #Ashes #EngvAus http://t.co/ZYjr3eXif2\n— Tariq Khan (@Tariq1_Khan) July 11, 2015 4. JOHNSON FINDS SPARK\nIt was a Test to forget for Mitchell Johnson, but he may have turned a corner. Source: AP\nCAN the bat create confidence with the ball?\nAussie Test great Mark Taylor believes so and it’s why he reckons Mitchell Johnson can return to his dominant best when the second Test gets underway on Thursday at Lord’s.\nJohnson was the best of the Australian batsmen during the tourists’ second innings collapse with a knock of 77 from 94 balls.\nTaylor reckons Johnson has a track record of producing his best bowling after a good innings with the willow.\n“When Johnson makes runs he takes wickets,” Taylor told Channel 9.\n“That’s what Australia will need at Lord’s. Someone who can take a bag full.”\nJohnson made England work for his wicket - and that can’t be said for most of his teammates.\nThe left-handed batsman produced another back-against the wall fighting innings where re refused to be broken as easily as the Aussie top order.\nJohnson’s lower order resistance at least took some of the shine off England’s jubilant ride to a series lead.\nFrom Brad Haddin’s wicket with the Aussies at 6-122, Johnson led Australia to 7/223 before partner Mitchell Starc fell to a stunning group catch which ended in the hands of Adam Lyth at first slip.\n5. STARC WILL BE FIT\nMitchell Starc is expected to play in the second Test. Source: Getty Images\nAustralian captain Michael Clarke has revealed he fully expects Mitchell Starc to play in the second Test, despite the fast-bowler having just five days to recover.\nStarc struggled with an injury in his right ankle throughout his bowling in both innings of the match.\nClarke said he is “confident” Starc will be able to recover after also facing 58 balls in his innings of 17 overnight.\nClarke feeling positive Starc will be fit after 2nd innings efforts with bat and ball in post-match comments #Ashes\n— cricket.com.au (@CricketAus) July 11, 2015 Starc’s fitness means Aussie selectors would have to drop one of it’s star fast-bowlers to consider following Ricky Ponting’s advice and re-calling forgotten quick Peter Siddle.\n6. MAGICAL COOK\nAlastair Cook isn’t under any pressure despite two failures with the bat. Source: Getty Images\nENGLAND Captain Alastair Cook could do no wrong, despite two early dismissals with the bat.\nEnglish fans have praised Cook for his captaincy throughout the first Test and the impressive results he and new coach Trevor Bayliss have achieved together.\nIn the field, everything Cook did turned to gold.\nHe twice fumbled catches and both times the ball was re-gathered before it hit the deck.\nHere’s the reaction to Cook’s leadership.\nAlastair Cook deserves a lorry load of praise for his captaincy in this match #Ashes2015\n— Chris Beck (@ChrisBecky20) July 11, 2015 ALASTAIR COOK CAPTAIN LEADER LEGEND\n— Alex (@alextwilson) July 11, 2015\nTrevor Bayliss influence on Poms and skipper Cook in particular event.

Brilliant captaincy, Cook. #Ashes\n— Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) July 11, 2015 You might be right @glennmcgrath11 - this could be 5-0. #Ashes\n— Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) July 11, 2015 Well played, England.
