And the deals they do want to get done may take a bit of time.\nFree agents can sign contracts they agree to starting July 9.\nTopping the Nuggets' to-do list is re-signing guards Jameer Nelson and Will Barton. Both played a huge role in stabilizing things on and off the court for a Nuggets team going through a turbulent season until early March, when coach Brian Shaw was fired.\nNelson's situation is the most complicated.\nHis own words at the end of the Nuggets' season explain why: \"Whatever I decide, I'll definitely discuss with that team what my role would be,\" said Nelson after the last game of the regular season. \"I feel like I'm definitely more than a 15- or 18-minute guy, for sure.\"\nNelson, 33, opted out of the last year of his contract, and the Nuggets want him back for his play on the court and his professionalism. . His daily example would be huge as the team grooms its 19-year old point guard Emmanuel Mudiay.\nAccording to those close to the situation, the Nuggets are a strong contender to retain his services. But for a player looking for a meaningful role, Nelson might have doubts. , The Nuggets are carrying multiple point guards — one guard under contract in Ty Lawson; Mudiay, the first-round draft pick who soon will be signed; and one on an unguaranteed contract, Erick Green.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-30T11:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T04:07:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
