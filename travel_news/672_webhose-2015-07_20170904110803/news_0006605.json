United had to halt flights on Wednesday in part because there were fewer airport staff on hand to help customers when automated check-in kiosks fell off the grid. \nThis was the second technical problem in about one month to ground United's fleet. On June 2, software needed to dispatch the airline's flight plan briefly lost functionality. \nAmerican Airlines Group Inc flights were delayed just a month earlier because of an application problem on pilots' iPads, which recently replaced paper flight manuals. Some planes returned to airport gates to access Wi-Fi and fix the issue. \nAirlines have backup systems, but the recent disruptions have left experts asking whether they have invested enough in technological infrastructure, given new profits from baggage and cancellation fees. \n\"They should have had much more built-in resiliency and redundancy in the system,\" Trend Micro Inc Chief Cybersecurity Officer Tom Kellermann said. \nTo be sure, technology has brought benefits like shorter wait times for check-in and more in-flight entertainment via Wi-Fi. \n\"Airlines' investment in technology is only going to continue to improve the customer experience,\" trade group Airlines for America said. \"When there is a rare disruption, it is often those investments that enable airlines to quickly restore service.\" \nConsultant and former American Airlines executive Scott Nason said the number of outages had not increased with automation. \n\"The difference,\" he said, \"is that when they occur, they can more easily affect the airlines' ability to actually fly.\" Reader's comments Â» \nBy adding a comment on the site, you accept our terms and conditions .
