The Eid al Fitr holidays have been anticipated and planned but the air tickets are flying higher than flights say customers. There are seasons and destinations to understand and analyse, say travel industry. For many who are waiting to take off to destinations with their families feel the impact on their wallets, which might influence on how they would spend during the holidays. According to the industry travellers in the country, Oman has a liking for high budget travel experience.\"Airlines hike their prices during holidays and this is just like any other season,\" said a father who is all set to take his children for a vacation abroad.One ticket cost him RO 430 but that did not stop the excitement of a holiday.Yet another passenger booked tickets for the family ten days ahead with the father planning to join them later.But to the father's dismay, the ticket rate had taken a leap by the time his turn came.Do airlines and travel agencies create this effect in the market?There is a difference of RO 300 to RO 400 between high and low seasons depending on the destination.Look at it from a practical point of view, says P Rajeev Nair, Managing Director of Oman Orient Travel and Tours.According to him, the airlines provide similar tiers in the low travel season and they are January, February and March as well as in the peak season, which is during May, June, July and August.The summer months are known for the annual holidays for school and college students.The students with their parents form a significant segment of holiday makers in summer. Even here you can plan it out, say travel industry experts.At present however, calls to travel agencies will get 'No, fully booked' for an answer.One travel agency said return tickets are available but not for departure. Seats are available for those travellers who plan well in advance for their journeys in the peak season with similarly priced tickets as those that are available in the low season, pointed out the industry expert. \"However the seats become filled very quickly during the peak season. The fares become marginally higher due to the demand and supply effect amidst all efforts taken by the airlines to accommodate all travellers during the peak period.It is imperative that travellers plan their holidays well in advance of the high season to avail the best fares that are available all the year around and get instant flight confirmations, which is a relief for a family of ten who wants to travel together,\" explained Nair.So it does not mean that the airlines do not change the fares in the peak season to take advantage of the traveller but it is a traveller's duty to plan and procure his travel services to get the best available ticket fares, concluded the managing director.Yet another travel agent, who wanted to be anonymous, said some travel agencies would still block the seats during the low fare season because they know for sure they will have the customers during the peak season.The walk-in customers who are the last minute travellers do not disappoint the travel agencies and airlines either as there is a constant flow. The cost of air tickets vary depending on the destinations in addition to the seasons.For example if it is December, flights to the Far East are in high demand compared to Europe because of the climatic conditions. Asia is one of the favourite all season destination for citizens and residents in Oman.In summer, Europe is an ideal destination for travellers from Oman. Another factor travellers need to define is the proposed budget.One week trip to an Asian country for a couple might cost RO 1,000, but if it is to Europe the budget would go up to RO 3,000.The number of flights operating to a destination determines the cost of tickets as well, pointed out a traveller. \"I would like to travel to Calicut in Kerala but there is always a demand to this sector because there are not many flights to this airport from Oman,\" he said.So is it all about planning? It is difficult said one traveller, \"It is difficult because travelling sometimes is a spur of the moment decision. It is impulsive. If there are holidays it is definitely an incentive.\" Â© Oman Daily Observer 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T09:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T20:40:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
