This year’s Grand Prix, 8-11 October 2015, invites all pre-1976 cars and will feature The Thomas Smith Mellieha Hill Climb, a Concours d’Elegance, practice and timed laps, and the final race on the 2.3km Mdina Circuit. \nFounded in 2007, the Valletta Grand Prix has secured its top spot on the international motor calendar, attracting both those fascinated by the mechanics under the cars’ hoods as well as those captivated by Malta’s blue skies as they are reflected in the restored vehicles. Vintage car aficionados and their graceful old machines, ranging from 1920s Bugatti’s to 1950s Ferraris and Aston Martins, will descend on the Mediterranean island and battle it out wheel to wheel around the ancient city’s winding roads, originally designed for horses and knights in shining armour. The event will feature hill climbs and a ‘Concourse d’Elegance’, held in the historic main square of Mdina, where the finest local period cars and motorbikes will vie with their foreign visitors for the ultimate crown. And the final climax – Sunday’s final race on the 2.3km Mdina Circuit. All of this can be enjoyed against a backdrop of Malta’s panoramic views in the island’s temperate climate and October sun, surrounded by vast historical heritage and lavish hotels and restaurants. Corinthia Palace Hotel & Spa, as the Mdina Grand Prix’s official hotel partner, will offer a special Mdina Grand Prix 2015 Package, featuring VIP access to the event.
