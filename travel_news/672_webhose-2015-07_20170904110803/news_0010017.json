The players association will appeal the ruling in court. By BARRY WILNER The Associated Press \nNEW YORK – The commissioner pointed to concealed evidence. The team described it as a folly. And the agent added sham to the lexicon of “Deflategate.” \nThen the players’ union said it would take the matter to court. \nTom Brady’s four-game suspension for his role in using underinflated footballs during the AFC Championship Game was upheld Tuesday by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. \nGoodell said the New England quarterback told an assistant to destroy Brady’s cellphone on or just before March 6. Brady met with independent investigator Ted Wells that day.

The Patriots were fined $1 million and docked a pair of draft picks. The team didn’t appeal its penalty, but Brady appealed. \nThe NFL Players Association said in a statement Tuesday it would appeal in court. \n“The NFL resorted to a nebulous standard of ‘general awareness’ to predicate a legally unjustified punishment,” the union said, adding, “the NFL violated the plain meaning of the collective bargaining agreement.” \nMoments after announcing Goodell’s decision, the league filed action in U.S. District Court in New York against the union, saying the commissioner has the right under the labor agreement to hand out such discipline “for conduct that he determines is detrimental to the integrity of, or public confidence in, the game of professional football.” \nGoodell mentioned exactly that in the conclusion of his appeal decision. \n“Especially in light of the new evidence introduced at the hearing — evidence demonstrating that he arranged for the destruction of potentially relevant evidence that had been specifically requested by the investigators — my findings and conclusions have not changed in a manner that would benefit Mr. Brady,” Goodell said. \nBut Yee argued that Brady’s side was given only four hours to present a defense, and when he asked for documents from Wells, that request was rejected on the basis of privilege. \n“We therefore had no idea as to what Wells found from other witnesses, nor did we know what those other witnesses said,” Yee said. \nYee also contends the electronic data presented in Brady’s defense was ignored during the appeal hearing. \nBrady and the Patriots have denied knowingly using deflated footballs in the 45-7 AFC title-game victory over Indianapolis. The Patriots went on to beat the Seahawks 28-24 in the Super Bowl and Brady was voted the game’s most valuable player. \nIn a statement, Patriots officials said, “We cannot comprehend the league’s position in this matter.” \nThe NFL announced in late January that Wells would head an investigation into New England’s use of underinflated balls against the Colts. More than three months later, the 243-page Wells report was issued, saying it was “more probable than not” Brady was “at least generally aware” that footballs he used were improperly deflated by team personnel. \nBrady appealed and the union asked Goodell to recuse himself from hearing the appeal because he could not be impartial and might be called as a witness. But Goodell said it was his responsibility to oversee the hearing to protect the integrity of the league. \nBrady, who turns 38 on Aug. 3, took nearly every snap last season. But he will miss the first four games this season unless the case goes to court. \nJimmy Garoppolo, a second-round pick in 2014, would replace Brady at quarterback. \nNew England hosts Pittsburgh on Sept. 10 to open the regular season.
