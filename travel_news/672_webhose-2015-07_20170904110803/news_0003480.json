Targeted at corporations and the travel management companies (TMCs) that serve corporate travel programs, the app leverages Traxo’s leading itinerary management and loyalty tracking technology to track and organize travel details, and customize the interface with the client’s own branding. \nTraxo’s new white label mobile app incorporates ALL of the traveler’s bookings, including both on-platform bookings (imported directly from the TMC or booking tool) as well as off-platform bookings (via supplier direct-connects and travel confirmation emails). Available as a standalone app for all major mobile platforms including iOS and Android, the app complements Traxo for Business ’ existing white label Travel Dashboard website solution. With its streamlined user interface, the white label mobile app offers TMCs a compelling, consumerized mobile experience in their own brand identity. \nThe new Traxo app comes with multiple features sought by business travelers, including: Ability to proactively monitor flight status information Quick access to gate changes during the trip Incorporation of all segments of the trip – including air, car, lodging and even dinner reservations and activities – all displayed in an elegant, sequential layout Ability to track loyalty accounts, including balances and expiration dates Persistent access to all their critical travel information like account and confirmation numbers \nFor TMCs, the ability to offer leading itinerary management technology – at a reasonable cost, under their own brand - is a vital component of supporting travelers while they are on the road. “We know TMCs want to be more than just a voice on the phone when something goes wrong; they want to be the de facto travel app on their traveling client’s smartphone or tablet,” said Cara Whitehill, senior vice president and GM, Traxo for Business. “Instead of sending their travelers off to a third party app, Traxo’s white label mobile app will help the TMC manage their relationships with travelers in a truly holistic manner – essentially keeping them within the agency’s walled-garden.” \nTraxo for Business also offers its established Travel Dashboard website and new white label mobile app to companies managing their own travel programs and to corporate travel departments (CTDs). Traxo is now booking deployments of the new white label mobile app for the fourth quarter of 2015. Traxo for Business will showcase its broad range of SaaS-based, B2B, and custom mobile solutions to more than seven thousand influencers at the annual Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) conference in Orlando on July 26-29 at booth number 1920. \nABOUT TRAXO FOR BUSINESS: \nTraxo for Business provides itinerary data aggregation solutions for corporations, TMCs, online booking tools, and other service providers to capture off-platform bookings, enhance policy compliance, and comprehensively track travel spend regardless of channel.
