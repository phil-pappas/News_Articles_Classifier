If the Red Line, or some form of transit, is not approved, then I think the city is moving backwards.” Gov. Larry Hogan said last month that he would not fund the Red Line, which would have linked distressed neighborhoods in West Baltimore with downtown, as well as Canton and Johns Hopkins Bayview to the east. Hogan, a Republican, and the state’s transportation chief Pete Rahn called the plan wasteful and ill-conceived. They criticized the Red Line’s inclusion of a $1 billion underground tunnel as costly and impractical. Brown said despite those valid cost concerns, Hogan shouldn’t have thrown out the project completely. “More and more people are using public transportation to get around. That’s the future. I think the governor has to recognize that and then they’re going to have to spend the money,” he said. “Eventually that investment will pay off.” In a report issued this month, advocacy group Red Line Now identified 6.5 million square feet of developments — new, planned and in progress — along the proposed Red Line corridor. The investments represent more than $3 billion in private funding. That includes Workshop Development’s proposed 16-story apartment tower on the site of the former Della Notte restaurant in Little Italy. It would have been one block from a Red Line stop. \nWant Baltimore Travel  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T14:30:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
