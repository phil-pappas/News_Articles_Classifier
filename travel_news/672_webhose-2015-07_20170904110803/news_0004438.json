For many it’s a challenging time because of the physiological changes that take place in the body – but there are ways of managing them. A loss of libido can be a symptom of the menopause (Getty) Here are five of the most common symptoms 1. Hot flushes Thought to occur in about three in four women, according to the health website Patient.co.uk, hot flushes are typically experienced as a feeling of intense heat that spreads upwards through the chest, neck and face, causing your skin to become red and profusely sweaty, and bringing on heart palpitations and dizziness. Often accompanied by night sweats, hot flushes can last (in extreme cases) for several years after the menopause. ‘It can feel as if you’re roasting from the inside out,’ says reiki therapist Lucinda Peyton-Jones, 60, who tried various tinctures and alternative therapies before (successfully) resorting to HRT treatment in the form of skin patches. • Menopause is no longer taboo ‘Once at a dinner party with friends I had to rip my clothes off literally. It was a nightmare.’ Cutting out alcohol, avoiding caffeine and spicy foods, wearing loose clothing and exercising daily are all thought to help prevent hot flushes. Some women keep small fans on their desks in order to stay cool. It's worth watching your weight (Alamy) 2. Weight gain, especially around the middle Typically a menopausal woman might develop a matronly shape with no waist. \"The metabolism slows down and this makes it harder to burn fat,\" says GP Elisa Kajita, who sees a lot of women at this time of life. \"That’s why it’s really important to remain active.\" Even if you’ve always been slim and healthy, you might need to eat less and exercise more just to keep your weight level. • How bad is the menopause? 3. Mood swings This can take the form of irritability, anxiety and even rage – it’s a bit like having PMT all the time. \"I found the mood swings particularly difficult, partly because they have an impact on others,\" says Lucinda Peyton-Jones. ‘You open your mouth and things just pop out – things you would never dream of saying normally.\" Your joints might be sore, so keep an eye on them (Alamy) 4. Joint pain Typically a woman might feel as if she has arthritis and be very creaky in the morning. \"This is due to a drop in oestrogen combined with getting older,\" says menopause specialist Dr Marilyn Glenville. Again, regular exercise, such as walking, swimming, dancing and cycling, are all thought to help. • 8 celebrities going through the menopause now 5. Dry, lacklustre skin \"You lose collagen after the menopause which causes skin to get dry, wrinkled and sagging,\" says Dr Elisa Kajita.\"Using a sunscreen is your first line of defence as well as a good-quality anti-ageing cream, ideally containing vitamins A and C.\" Nutrients are another option. Some women take Omega-3 fish oil supplements to lessen the menopause’s impact.
