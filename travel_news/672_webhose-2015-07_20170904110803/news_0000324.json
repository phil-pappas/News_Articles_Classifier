Steve Cheng and Meghann Seiler, the husband-and-wife co-owners, are aiming for “updated” Chinese cuisine with a “focus on flavor above tradition, while remaining true to the Chinese palate.”\nThis gives the kitchen some wiggle room. Already there have been changes afoot. Opening co-executive chefs Kenny Lee (formerly of Shallots Asian Bistro) and Pat Chang (previously at Joule and Revel) departed after just six months. It bodes well that succeeding them are executive chef Matthew Woolen and sous chef Cameron Chomko, both from The Old Sage. “The idea is to bring in fresh ideas with a modern molecular approach to a cuisine that often gets trapped by tradition,” says Cheng.\nZhu Dang ★★    Chinese 1715 E.

I hope certain dishes will stick around, among them stellar sheng jian bao, pan-seared dumplings, plump with pork and fragrant with five-spice; elegant, oolong-smoked, poached albacore with charred bok choy; and phenomenal fried rice bright with basil, studded with house-cured bacon and topped with a deep-fried duck egg that could double as Royal Ascot headgear.\n The hurdle for some in embracing all that Zhu Dang has to offer will be price. Beef chow fun, for example, is a dish you can get for $8.99 for at your local Chinese takeout or favorite Chinatown International District joint. Here it’s $16. But house-made XO sauce injects this chow fun with some agreeable funk, the beef is top-notch flank steak and plentiful, and gai lan peeks from among the wide noodles. It’s worth every cent.\nWagyu beef from Snake River Farm is used for spicy, silky-textured Mongolian beef tartare. It’s served with taro chips for conveyance, a biting watercress salad and a small bowl of black-bean sauce that gives the beef an extra dimension.\nA profusion of mushrooms — oyster, shiitake, hen-of-the woods, cloud ears — cram a clay pot, joining cabbage and fried tofu skins in a gingery, garlicky stew. Ma Po tofu is even more potent, sizzling with green Szechuan chilies, dense with minced pork, mushrooms and soft tofu.\nNine Flavor Chicken’s bite-size, boneless, battered chunks revel in a hoisin-like sauce rife with lemon grass, coconut, peanuts and countless more. “Here is your ninth flavor,” said the waiter, setting down a bowl of fresh lime wedges with a flourish.\nThe youthful staff includes shy guys and show-boaters. They’ve all clearly had some training. Despite an offer to course the dishes we ordered one night, however, several arrived at once, in the Chinese way.\nNot everything was a full-on success. A viscous, cornstarchy garlic sauce undercut velveted Gulf prawns with steamed asparagus. Dull spring-onion pancakes bore little evidence of duck cracklings. Wok-seared long beans were a little tame, despite the presence of salted radish and chili black bean sauce.\nSpicy sausage wasn’t all that spicy; the sweet version tasted slimy. Neither sausage was as interesting as the spiced pickled pear with it. And even though Zhu Dang translates as “Pig Party,” the bland BBQ Wuxi pork ribs didn’t wow me.\nWhat did wow me is the setting. The restaurant is handsomely housed in a building that was part of last century’s Auto Row, but you could probably park a private jet in this cavernous space. (They have a lot of seats to fill: 120 in the dining room, plus 20 on the patio, and 100 more in the banquet room.)\nSample menu Sheng jian bao  $10\nMongolian beef tartare  $14\nBasil fried rice  $13\nNine Flavor Chicken  $16\nHoisin diver scallops  $23\nThe brick walls are a rough canvas for the work of local artists. Half a dozen huge, golden lanterns hover below the exposed ceiling beams, shedding subdued light on the original 1920s plank floor and a spacious grid of black lacquered tables and turquoise-cushioned booths as big as some “aPodments.”\nTurquoise and gold carry through to the bar, where manager Scott Rixe can often be found. He muddles Asian pear into a Macau Mule. The gin-based Basil Smash is indeed smashing. Take him up on his offer to tailor a cocktail to your taste and he’ll likely nail it.\nDesserts go beyond the fruity gelatin typical of Chinese restaurants. Funnel cake was a treat. Served with vanilla ice cream and orange anglais, the three-dimensional structure, freckled with black sesame seeds, resembled Chinese characters. For all I know, it was “zoo dang,” written in fried dough.\nProvidence Cicero is The Seattle Times restaurant critic.
