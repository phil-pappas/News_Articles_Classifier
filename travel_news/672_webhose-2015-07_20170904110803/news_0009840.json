Clay Higgins giving a somewhat routine police report but then it takes a unique turn.\nHiggins changes his focus to the suspect in the crime and says:\n((youtube.com/KATCnews)) \"Look at me son, I’m talking to you. The sheriff likes Stelly’s Restaurant, and so do I. The food here is good, and the folks are friendly. We’re going to identify you, arrest you, and put you in a small cell. After that, I’m going to have a cheeseburger here with fries and a Coke and leave a nice tip for the waitress. Meanwhile, your next meal will be served through a small hole in a cell door\"\nThe lieutenant then confidently reports on how the suspect will likely be caught saying:\n\"By tomorrow, 100,000 people will have you watched you commit a felony. You will be recognized, and the people that know you don’t really like you anyway, so when it comes down to a choice between you and a $1,000: They’ll take the cash.\"\nThe video was posted to YouTube on July 23 and according to St Landry Crime Stoppers Facebook page , the suspect has not been apprehended.\nTrending on Facebook\nOnce in a Blue Moon is coming next week Lawsuit: Popular brand of almond milk contains almost no almonds Bobbi Kristina Brown dies at age 22 Child’s deathbed thoughts focused on helping others Waitress fired, restaurant owner sorry after customers labeled 'black couple' on receipt More popular and trending stories", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/07/27/95/78/St__Landry_Crime_Stoppers_looking_for_thief_who_broke_into_Stelly_s_Supermarket_-_YouTube.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/CMGNationalNews", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/St-Landry-Crime-Stoppers/179615315411918"], "published": "2015-07-27T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T02:21:44.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
