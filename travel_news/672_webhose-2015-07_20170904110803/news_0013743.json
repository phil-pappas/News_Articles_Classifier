A poll of 3,000 blonde women showed that professional ladies in London were concerned that being fair still made them appear more frivolous. However the poll also suggests that a host of successful blonde businesswomen and politicians like Michelle Mone and Hillary Clinton are changing the perception. Half of women surveyed said they no longer felt being blonde was associated with being ‘ditzy’ while two-thirds of women said perceptions had evolved for the better in recent years. Model Twiggy, whose sleek blonde urchin cut became a hair cult in the 1960s, said: “The concept of being blonde has changed over the years. “It’s great to see that we have many more women in power, be it in business and in politics, who are blonde. From Hillary Clinton to Michelle Mone, Kate Moss to Taylor Swift. “It’s refreshing to see that the research reveals that perceptions about blondes are changing for the better” Ultimo founder Michelle Mone The poll questioned 3,000 blondes – both natural and ‘bottle’ - to explore changing attitudes towards the iconic hair colour and the women wearing it ahead of the launch of L’Oréal Professionnel’s ‘I Am My Blonde’ campaign Colourist Jo Hansford runs her busy Mayfair salon which is a magnet for A listers, royalty and leading businesswomen said: \"Blondes themselves haven't changed but the social perception of blondes certainly has. “More and more characters within film and TV portray blondes as being not only sexy, but intelligent, strong and independent. \"Characters like Claire Underwood, played by Robin Wright, in House of Cards, and stars like Taylor Swift have helped break the stereotype of the ditzy blonde who just wants to have ‘fun’.\" Claire Underwood in the remake of House of Cards When asked what does it mean to you to be a blonde today, a third of women said that they feel more confident (33 per cent); a quarter feel younger (27 per cent) and also happier (26 per cent). The popularity of so-called ‘bronde’ hair – a mix of blonde and darker shades – is also increasing. Nearly a third of women polled by researchers described ‘bronde’ as their current look. The colour ‘platinum blonde’ was most popular in East Anglia (20 per cent); the ‘honey blonde’ most popular in the South West (31 per cent); the ‘golden blonde’ most popular in the North East (31 per cent); and the strawberry blonde was most popular in Northern Ireland (10 per cent). @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T22:42:48.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
