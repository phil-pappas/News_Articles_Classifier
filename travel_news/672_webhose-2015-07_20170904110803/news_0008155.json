(Photo: Larry Olmsted for USA TODAY) \nThe scene: Bartaco is the more casual of two brands operated by the same restaurant group. Conceived as a less expensive, more street food alternative to big sibling Barcelona Wine Bar Restaurant, both concepts began in Connecticut and have quickly spread down the East Coast. Barcelona focuses on more traditional Spanish cuisine, especially the small plate and wine-by-the-glass tapas style the group’s founder came to love while living in Spain and Portugal. Bartaco was launched as a livelier, more casual offshoot with many similarities, especially the small plate focus, but with street food cuisine reflecting a broader swatch of Latin cooking, including Mexico, Uruguay and Brazil. Some locations of each brand are standalone, and some are shared, with bartaco and Barcelona occupying adjoining spaces, as they do in a couple of Connecticut spots and in Reston, Va. Bartaco can also be found in New York, Atlanta and Tampa, with eight locations across five states. \nThe darkish space has a trendy, funky feel, with plenty of seating at the bar, at high-top bar tables and at more conventional high-backed booths or tables, making it perfect for everything from a quick drink and bite to date night. It skews to a younger audience, and mixes casual and sleek touches, with blonde wood surfaces, tea candles on tables and utensils – including chopsticks – arrayed self-serve in recycled aluminum cans on the tables, along with a trio of house hot sauces. Each guest gets a metal tray lined with brown paper instead of a plate, and dishes are served on the same, making it easy to share or mix and match. \nThe most distinguishing element at bartaco is the ordering process: Every table has a stack of menu slips and pencils, and you fill these out yourself, ordering mostly small plates and apps, which come in fast and furious fashion. It’s designed for grazing, so you don’t have to order your whole meal at once, but like dim sum, you can just keep submitting additional slips until you are satiated. There is a raised stand in which you place a card to summon wait staff, otherwise you get an uninterrupted break from attention, good for lingering and conversation. Staff in general was excellent, very knowledgeable and helpful, and all this creates a fun, different dining atmosphere. \nReason to visit: Wild boar, spicy chorizo and Baja fish tacos; plantains; clarico; inventive cocktails; chips, salsa and guacamole \nThe food: The approach, menu, beverage concept and service at bartaco is all great, but the actual food was hit or miss. On the bar side, there are a lot of wines by the glass, mostly from South America but also California, Spain and Italy, all reasonably priced. The cocktail list is fun and creative, with fanciful takes on Latin classics like margaritas, pisco sours, caipirinhas and some homegrown cocktails using ingredients like mezcal, watermelon and mango nectar. One of the most interesting touches is the “clarico” option, which basically lets you add a $6 carafe of fresh cut fruit, sugar and ice to any bottle of wine for do-it-yourself sangria at the table. It’s fun idea that I have never seen before, and it also lets people who are split between traditional wine and sangria share without having to compromise. There is also a nice slate of Mexican and American beers, including regional craft offerings. \nThe food menu is equally creative, and largely divided into two categories: tacos and “not tacos.” Tacos have been trendy in recent years, but here they take more offbeat approach, with options including fish (two styles), wild boar, pork belly, portobello with fresh cheese, falafel, fried oyster and duck, among others. There notably is no typical Americanized ground beef offering, though there is sesame ribeye. All are small, on a soft corn tortilla about 4 inches in diameter, good for two to three bites, sold individually and not really for sharing (get two). Most of the taco choices are also offered as heartier rice bowls, with the same toppings and some veggies atop a heap of brown rice, but I found the rice bland and out of proportion to the toppings – for the same money, you’re better off ordering three tacos. I really liked the wild boar taco, very flavorful. The Baja-style fish was excellent as well, though they wouldn’t use catfish in Baja (this style was battered and fried crunchy, while the other, Veracruz fish taco, uses grilled perch). My other favorite was the spicy chorizo, and if I returned I would limit myself to these and maybe the curry shrimp, mild but tasty. The falafel was pretty good, but unless you are a vegetarian, it would be better saved for a Middle Eastern restaurant. I love pork belly and most looked forward to this one, but it was too fatty and just kind of blah. The fried oyster taco had way too much tartar-like sauce, overwhelming both the taste and texture of the oysters. \nFrom the sides and “not tacos” options, the waiter heartily suggested grilled Mexican street corn, grilled corn on the cob with cotija cheese and lime, and in this case, cayenne pepper. But it was bland, mainly because corn wasn’t in season (this is a dish that should only be had with fresh corn). Sweet plantains were a standout, perfectly cooked, tender and delicious, great on their own but served with a unique “creamy gordita” dipping sauce that was also very good. The most interesting item was the quirky take on chips and salsa, plus excellent, creamy, rich, homemade guacamole. Here you get big full-size circular tortillas, which you break up and dip into a tasty green tomatillo salsa. The house-made hot sauces were all good, and ranged from a yellow fruity version to a vinegary red of medium heat to a spicy but not overwhelming green habanero, something for every palate. For the grand finale we had the churros, and while the fried dough sticks themselves were good, hot and fresh but not greasy, and nicely coated with sugar, the chocolate dipping sauce was thin and added nothing to the sweet finish. \nAt the end of the day I wanted to love bartaco, because it’s cool and a great idea, but the food wasn’t as moving as the overall concept. With experience there are plenty of tasty things to cherry-pick off the menu. Also, while individual dishes appear reasonably priced, they are quite small, with no sides, and the bill adds up much faster than you might think. \nPilgrimage-worthy?: No, but a very different night out, fun for groups. \nRating: Mmmm (Scale: Blah, OK, Mmmm, Yum!, OMG!) \nPrice: $$ ($ cheap, $$ moderate, $$$ expensive) \nDetails: Eight locations, three in Connecticut, two in Atlanta, one each in New York, Virginia and Florida; bartaco.com \nMORE: Read previous columns \nLarry Olmsted has been writing about food and travel for more than 15 years.
