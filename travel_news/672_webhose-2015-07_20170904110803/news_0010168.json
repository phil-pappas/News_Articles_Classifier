July 21. Save the date, Kansas Citians. Two weeks from now, another meeting will be held on the future of Kansas City International Airport . Michael Grimaldi , a spokesman for Mayor Sly James ' office, said a \"special meeting\" will be held. Grimaldi said he thinks the meeting will be what people have been waiting for. In that meeting, he said, there will be some discussion of what the airlines that fly out of KCI (Code: MCI) have been studying in accordance with their lease agreement at the airport. Representatives from Southwest Airlines Co. probably will headline the meeting. The Dallas-based low-cost carrier (NYSE: LUV) controls the largest portion of the airport's market share. Home of the Day RELATED: After much scrutiny, KCI planning goes radio silent The meeting comes soon after Kansas City's municipal elections. In the run-up to the June 23 vote, James told the Kansas City Business Journal that he expected the \"airlines recommendations will be coming within the next months.\" Under the lease agreement, representatives of the city and the airlines have been hashing out the best course of action for the airport. SInce a new lease agreement was announced in February 2014 and an advisory board recommended rebuilding KCI as a single-terminal airport in May 2014, there's been little public discussion of the airport's future. In Southwest's most recent appearances in Kansas City, the airline's leadership has reiterated that \"doing nothing\" is not an option for the airport but that the cost must be controlled . RELATED: Southwest CEO: Improve KCI, but watch the cost The City Clerk's website, where the city lists its schedule of coming meetings at City Hall, extends only through Thursday. Southwest confirmed that the airline will be present for the event. The airport discussion began in 2013 with the presentation of a plan to replace the airport's more than 40-year-old three-terminal layout with a $1.2 billion, multistory single-terminal layout . The city's leaders have since distanced themselves from the single-terminal plan. \nWant Kansas City Travel news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
