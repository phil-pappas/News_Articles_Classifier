Typically, events of this kind have taken place in the South with London hosting many of the largest expo in the industry. However the popularity of The Venue Expo is testament to the need for the North to have their own event as well as bringing business from all around the UK to the North. \nThe Venue Expo is set to connect the events industry with a vast array of venues, destinations and event services with an aim to provide outstanding business opportunities for both exhibitors and buyers and will help set up Liverpool as the hub where business is done. Seeing the importance of The Venue Expo to the North West as well as the UK MICE industry as a whole, the Lord Mayor of Liverpool, Councillor Tony Concepcion, will be attending this year’s event and address the attendees on stage. The Lord Mayor has said: \"The success of The Venue Expo is testament to Liverpool’s continuing success as one of Europe's leading destinations for large scale exhibitions. This year's show will bring together buyers from across the UK and abroad with outstanding business opportunities on offer. “In addition it is also one of the first high profile events to take place in the Exhibition Centre Liverpool - a brand new state of the art venue. \"I am delighted that the biggest event of its type in the North has chosen Liverpool as its home.” Registration to attend The Venue Expo is FREE.
