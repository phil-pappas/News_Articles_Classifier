Officials reveal that the tourism board will focus on promoting the kingdom as a “Quality Leisure Destination through Thainess.”\nThe plan marks the start of a new era for Thai tourism. The wording of the new strategy indicates an end to decades of absolute focus on “quantity”, as measured by visitor arrivals, and a total shift to “quality”,which is instead measured by visitor expenditure, average length of stay, and the overall quality of the visitor experience.Minister of Tourism and Sports, H.E. Kobkarn Wattanavrangkul has called on the entire industry, including both the private and public sectors, to work on the principles of the 3Rs: “Restructure, Rebalance and Reposition.”\n Repositioning: Gearing towards tourism quality (Quality Leisure Destination).\n Restructure: Identifying new target markets both in terms of geography and customer segments.\n Rebalance: Attaining a balance between economic, social and environmental development by better spreading the benefits of tourism across Thai society, and reducing the social, cultural and environmental impact.\nIn 2016, TAT is confident that Thailand will remain in the top 3 ranking in terms of international tourism receipts in the Asian region. The targets for 2016, as measured entirely in revenue earnings, are up by 8% over the projected earnings for 2015, or around 2.3 trillion Baht. Also international and domestic tourism will be both up by 8% over the same period, which is above the growth projections for the overall Thai national economy for 2016.\nThe theme, along with the targets and marketing strategies were finalised at the TAT’s annual marketing plan meeting held in the beach resort of Bang Saen, a rapidly emerging destination about 65 kilometres east of Bangkok. The meeting was attended by more than 400 TAT executives and officers from head office and worldwide.\nMrs. Juthaporn Rerngronasa, Acting Governor of TAT said, “This plan marks the opening of a new chapter for Thai tourism. It is based on the fact that there is more than adequate accessibility to Thailand via excellent air, road and sea connections, as well as smooth facilitation that allows visa-free or visa-on- arrival access for citizens from 68 countries and territories.\n“As Thailand has the natural geographical advantage of being located right in the heart of the Asia-Pacific and ASEAN regions, we can be sure of strong arrival figures for years to come, assuming that the external and internal operating environment remains stable. So, we can confidently say that the era of promoting ‘quantity’ is over. The era of promoting ‘quality’ has begun.”\nSource:-TAT\nRelated Posts TIA welcomes the New Zealand Story Chelsea Football Club Hosts Leaders Sport Summit 2013, the world’s most Prestigious Sport Business Summit Siemens to realign regional organization and strengthen corporate units Record number of US runners register to compete in Cuban Marathon ‘Marabana’ Destination NSW Regional Manager UK And Germany Appointed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T01:28:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
