An important part of our role as tourism leaders is to recognize the responsibility that we have in the creation of those changes. \nFour years ago, when Karisma Hotels & Resorts began our \"Passion for Sustainability\" program, we saw an opportunity to create a cultural change in the way in which our 4,000 employees and their families managed the waste in their homes, in a way in which we could also strengthen two of the values of our company: Teamwork & Passion. \nThis is how we created an initiative called \"Recycling makes Sense,\" through which we invited all our employees to bring recyclable waste from their homes and at each of our properties, we collected it, classified it and sold it to an authorized supplier. The money collected over a period of three months was used to support projects centered on: Health, Education, Housing, Sports and Culture. The employees and their families developed these projects and the company further assisted by providing matching funds to the amount raised via the recycling. \nSo far “Recycling makes Sense” has supported the purchase of: \n• 10 uniforms for the youth Basketball team “Strong” in Tulum, Trained by one of our Housekeeping maids \n• One Medical Treatment for one of our collaborator´s son (10 sessions) in order to recover his full health after an accident \n• Four wheelchairs for our collaborator´s sons and daughters with disabilities \n• Four sets of medical hearing devices for: 1 of our Staff members and 3 family members of different collaborators \n• Two eye surgeries for two of our collaborators, who needed an urgent intervention not included on their Medical Insurances \nTo this initiative, we have recently added the support of health professionals such as Dr. Laura Romero, who donated her time and expertise and performed the eye surgeries that allowed two of our staff members to recover their sight along with their quality of life. \nAll these results make us proud as a company, as we have seen that this initiative has a great impact on the quality of life of our employees and their families. We also believe it is important for us to share this initiative with the tourism community, so it can be easily taken up by other companies, communities and destinations around the world and with it we can achieve a bigger impact and a cultural change in benefit of the environment and our communities. Remember, \"one man's trash is another man's treasure.\" We invite you to copy this initiative and contact us if you want to know more about our programs. \nGreen Globe has certified the sustainable operation of six Karisma Hotels & Resorts in the Riviera Maya region of Mexico.
