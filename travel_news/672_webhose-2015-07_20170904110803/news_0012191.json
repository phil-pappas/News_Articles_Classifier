Inmates rioting, setting fire to mattresses in the recreation yard, and the prison in lockdown before a truce of sorts was negotiated — including a slow introduction of the ban to give the fictional inmates more time to quit.\nProphetic show ... Authorities could learn a thing or two from Wentworth . Source: Supplied\nWentworth has long drawn inspiration from the stories of real-life inmates, and this one was no exception.\nSources from within the Melbourne Remand Centre said today cigarettes had started running out a week ago, fuelling tensions in the prison. It was also claimed stocks of tobacco were being stashed by inmates, then uncovered in cell checks, and prisoners who smoke were recruiting — sometimes forcibly — nonsmoking inmates to buy the weekly quota of cigarettes to add to their supplies.\nAll of these incidents were touched in Wentworth ’s season three opener.\nUltimately the episode, called The Governor’s Pleasure, saw prison heads agree to a softer approach to the smoking ban — something Corrections Victoria bosses had already tried ahead of last night’s riots, which lasted some 15 hours and saw three prison staff and five inmates injured.\nPrison riots ... Footage from Channel Seven shows prisoners running wild. Source: Supplied\nVictoria Corrections Commissioner Jan Shuard said corrections had done “an enormous amount” of work leading up to the ban with only 10 to 20 per cent of inmates unable to kick the habit at the time of the riot. Nicotine replacement therapy, a quit program and addition recreation activities would continue, she said.\nIn three seasons Wentworth , a reimagining of 1980s Australian hit series Prisone r , has won accolades for its gritty, realistic and sometimes brutal prison storylines. Recognition came at this year’s 2015 Logie Awards, where Wentworth won Most Outstanding Drama Series and lead Danielle Cormack, who plays prison top dog Bea Smith on the show, won Most Outstanding Actress.\nThe smoking ban at Victorian prisons remains in force from today.\nOver at fictional Wentworth, where season three wrapped in fiery style — complete with explosions far eclipsing the lighting of a ciggie — and filming of season four is yet to start, the ultimate test of the full ban is still to come.\nOriginally published as TV show psychic about prison riots", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/aussie-drama-wentworth-could-have-predicted-melbournes-prison-riots-sparked-over-a-smoking-ban/story-e6frfmyi-1227423673986", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/01/1227423/684181-d0269588-1fa8-11e5-9bcb-f95a534f046c.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/01/1227423/673458-8fcd86da-1fa9-11e5-9bcb-f95a534f046c.jpg", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/riot-breaks-out-at-metropolitan-remand-centre-on-eve-of-jail-smoking-ban/story-fni0fee2-1227422692647"], "published": "2015-07-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T08:52:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
