Linda Nolan has begun repaying the debt of £6,000 Scott D'Arcy – 06 July 2015 10:23 AM\nThe 56-year-old, who found fame with the Nolan Sisters in the Seventies, was given a caution by Blackpool Council for failing to disclose her earnings and for overpayment of housing and council tax benefits, and council tax reduction scheme savings.\nThe star has already begun repaying the money, which totalled around £6,000, according to the council.\nIn an interview with the Sunday People, she said she wished never to repeat the “honest mistake”.\n“This has ruled my life for so long. It was the last thing I thought about at night and the first thing in the morning,” she said.\n“I felt sick every time the phone rang or when I saw a letter on the doormat. Everything has been on hold for me but I’m ready to start living again. I’ve learned so much from this and above all, I’ve realised I’m stronger than I thought.”\nWhen she received a court summons in May, the star said she felt “very, very low”.\n“I was scared to death of appearing in court. It’s all so public, the thought of it was horrific.”\nCAUTION\nNolan said she received messages of support from her sisters Maureen and Coleen, as well as fans,\nafter accepting the caution.\n“I was so emotional, overwhelmed. I wasn’t charged with dishonesty, which was very important to me, because it’s simply not true. It was an honest mistake,” she added. She also spoke of her relief the case would not interfere with her ability to be a foster parent.\nNolan was initially charged with fraudulently claiming about £12,000 after she was said to have failed to declare income from TV appearances and a magazine column.\nBut the Department of Work and Pensions later closed its case against her, leaving only the Blackpool Council prosecution remaining.", "external_links": ["http://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/article31353701.ece/0d3dc/ALTERNATES/h342/2015-07-06_wor_10929763_I1.JPG"], "published": "2015-07-06T18:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T16:47:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
