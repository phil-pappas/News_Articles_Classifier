It's a good question — and a valid one. \nAnd while luxurious, shiny is something the Aleenta Hua Hin is most definitely not. The property is boutique in every sense of the word — don't let yourself think this simply means the resort is small in size — it's also fashionable and specialised, offering an experience not easily attainable at larger establishments. \nModern amenities are, of course, available upon request — televisions and beach umbrellas, for example — but Noble hopes that guests will forego unnecessary comforts and enjoy the resort for its minimalist rusticity, using their holiday as time to clear their minds and relax. \nCertain room types come with private pools, and all have beach views (as do the restaurants and spa). The property as a whole thrums with a sense of isolation that is at once peaceful and exciting. A stay at the Aleenta Hua Hin is ethereal, taking guests away from hustle and bustle. It might as well be located on another planet — that's a good thing. \nNoble's real focus — and his passion — revolves around sustainability, something the Aleenta Hua Hin has essentially mastered. The resort is an astounding 87 per cent sustainable. From the shampoo to the furniture to the charcoal used in the kitchen to the eggs served at breakfast, nearly everything is made with ingredients or materials sourced within a 30km radius of the property. That includes the employees, who must live within the same area in order to be considered for work. \nThe organic farm located directly across the street is Noble's botanical pet, and a place of massive benefit for everyone involved, employees and guests alike, as those who work for the resort eat free — as do their families. \nTouring the 24-acre farm (where, in addition to the resort's restaurants, some of the produce used in the kitchen of Italics restaurant in Bangkok is also sourced, see page 12) is akin to a trip through a vegetarian Willy Wonka's factory. Some fields are co-op, some are rented, and each bears large areas in which maize, grapes, basil, citronella, aloe vera, hydroponic mushrooms, asparagus, peanuts, watermelons and so much more are grown. It's a buffet of the natural, and as beautiful as it is fantastical. \nThere are also free-range chickens and grass-fed beef, raised for the consumption of the more carnivorous among us, but everything grown for use at the resort is well cared for and put to good use. Almost nothing goes to waste, which is a settling thought — or at least it should be — to potential holidaymakers. Low carbon certainly, but the Aleenta Hua Hin nevertheless leaves quite the memorable footprint. \nA midweek stay in Jul, Aug or Sep will run you B4,000++ per night for an Ocean View Residence, including a breakfast served in-room on a three-tiered tray. Farm tours are free. \n- 183 Moo 4, Paknampran, Pran Buri Tell us what you think about this article Like dislike 0 people liked / 0 people disliked it Share this article", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T23:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T16:22:32.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
