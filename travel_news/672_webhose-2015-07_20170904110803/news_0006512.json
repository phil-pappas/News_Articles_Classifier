According to one study, 200 items were stolen every day from checked bags at New York’s JFK airport. Beal recognized this was bad for business and travelers alike. He created Pick Proof Seals for these reasons and his innovative product is now part of a Kickstarter campaign to make these simple security locks available to the public.\n“A common misconception is that bags need to be unlocked so TSA (Transportation Security Administration) can search them,” says Beal. “This is not true. They need only to be easily accessible by airport security but not vulnerable to unscrupulous baggage handlers. That’s where Pick Proof Seals work perfectly.”\nThese Seals help TSA isolate where theft is occurring in the process. These small plastic locks have a seal that cannot be reattached once opened, so undetected theft is virtually impossible, unlike many luggage locks that can be picked and relocked without being detected. Each seal also has a unique, numbered ID with a matching detachable tag so that there is no question that it is the same Pick Proof Seal that was originally placed on the item. This is especially important for shipping valuable items that are likely to catch the eye of a thief.\nMany products require a quality seal for the protection of the customer, merchandise and the person transporting the goods. “There are some companies that move pharmaceuticals to retail pharmacies and hospitals. Some of these are narcotics and controlled substances. Sealing and securing the product is vital,” said Beal.\nMost of the hard work is done, but Beal is turning to Kickstarter’s crowdfunding platform to help make his product a reality for the travel industry. While a product costs very little to create, the mold, marketing and shipping can be expensive. Beal is using a crowdfunding campaign to bring the Pick Proof Seal to the world. “I need backing, and crowdfunding is the best solution for a product like this with mass appeal. Interested parties can donate to the Kickstarter campaign and receive their own set of seals as a reward for contributing and thus help us get the product into the marketplace.\nUniversal Sourcing Solutions will handle the production of the new seals. The company started out packaging and tracking packages for various companies including Fortune 500 Companies like Dell Computers, Sony and Sanyo. As the manufacturing shift to China unfolded, the company also shifted its goals to product development. The company meets with a customer and provides consulting services on the best way to create the product. Universal Sourcing Solutions then helps with the Design, Mold Making, Manufacturing, and even packaging, shipping and customs clearance if needed. Universal Sourcing Solutions helps entrepreneurs transform ideas into revenue.\nBeal needs $165,000.00 to help make Pick Proof Seals become mainstream in the travel industry. Crowdfunding means that anyone can give as little as $20.00 to help fund this product. Each donor will receive a set of Pick Proof Seals as a gift for their generous donation.
