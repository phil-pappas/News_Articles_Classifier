More Baby goods makers take punt on Abenomics \nIn the first six months of 2015, according to new estimates by the Japan National Tourism Organisation, 9.1m people visited Japan, 46 per cent up on the same period in 2014. In the same period, 7.6m Japanese travelled overseas. \nIn June, when a cruise ship terminal opened in the southern port of Fukuoka and the number of duty-free shopping facilities increased, Chinese arrivals rose 167 per cent over the same period last year. \nThe number of inbound tourists, which included substantial increases from Taiwan and South Korea, is projected to reach a record 18m by the end of the year. \nThat appears to put Japan on course to achieve one of the targets set under the Abenomics banner — 20m tourist arrivals by the time Tokyo hosts the Olympic Games in 2020. \nThe rise in Chinese visitor arrivals might moderate, however. Masaharu Hirokane, an equity strategist at Nomura, said the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome in South Korea this year had caused Chinese visits there to fall, with Japan becoming the alternative destination. South Korea is the favourite overseas destination for Chinese tourists after Hong Kong and Macau. \nThe inbound tourism numbers, accompanied by what is known as a bakugai , or buying explosion, across swaths of Japan’s retail sector, has provided a critical boost for the economic revival programme of Shinzo Abe, the prime minister. The weaker yen has made it cheaper for people to visit, and an easing of visa rules has provided a further boost in numbers. \nDuty-free shopping was available at nearly 19,000 department stores, drugstores and convenience stores across Japan as of April, more than triple the number a year earlier. At the 7-11 convenience store chain, about 10 per cent of its average daily sales per outlet is attributed to foreign tourists. \nStockbrokers have taken the opportunity to tout shares in everything from railway, resort and hotel operators to convenience stores and pharmaceutical companies. Many of those bets have paid off handsomely. Shares in Ringer Hut, a low-cost noodle chain that appeals to Chinese cruise passengers rushing to eat a quick lunch before resuming their shopping, have risen 46 per cent this year. \nRising disposable incomes in China have put the country’s tourists at the top of the international spending tables since 2012. Their combined spending in 2014 is estimated at $140bn and, echoing the inflection point just reached in Japan, the number of annual outbound visits from China is set to overtake inbound ones by the end of this year. \nThe influx has made Japanese department stores such as Isetan Mitsukoshi bullish enough to delay the launch of summer sales as they count on wealthy Chinese to support the prices. It has also helped offset a decline in sales from the cooler weather with department store sales rising 0.4 per cent in June, helped by a 307 per cent increase to foreign tourists, according to industry figures. \nAt Santen Pharmaceutical, an eyecare company, sales of Beautéye, a pink, rose-scented eyedrop, are several times bigger than last year thanks to Chinese spending. “We are doing everything we can to meet up with the demand,” said Takashi Hibi, a general manager at Santen.
