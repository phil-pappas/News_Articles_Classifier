(AP) - The annual Kids Count report says New Hampshire has improved in economic stability and child poverty levels, but is falling behind in teen substance abuse.\nThe report from the Annie E. Casey Foundation released Tuesday says nationally, New Hampshire has risen from fourth to second place in the national child well-being ranking.\nBut it tied with six states for the highest number of teens who abuse alcohol and drugs. New Hampshire's rate of teens who misuse alcohol and drugs remained unchanged from 2011-2012 to 2012-2013 at 7 percent. But other states have improved. New Hampshire, ranked 44th, is tied for the lowest ranking with Colorado, Hawaii, Montana, New Mexico, Vermont and Wyoming.\nThe study also found that while child poverty decreased, there has been a slow, steady climb since 2000.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
