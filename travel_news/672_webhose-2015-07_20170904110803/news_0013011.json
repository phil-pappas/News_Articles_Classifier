Photographer's Note \nThe front doorway to Cotehele; a Tudor house. The date by the doorway reads 1862,I am unsure just what this refers to as the house was built in the 1500's.Maybe this entrance was built on later. I have titled the shot 'Which way next?' as the man that you can see through the passageway was deciding just which way to go next.He is standing in a courtyard, where there are several options open to him. From a distance the house looks grey, but here in the closer view you can see all the different colours of stone. Cotehele is decorated with tapestries, arms and armour, pewter,brass and old oak furniture.One of my favourite National Trust places.
