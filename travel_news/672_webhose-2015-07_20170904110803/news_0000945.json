According to the Economist Intelligence Unit research, as much as 75pc of a business’s value is directly attributed to its reputation. So what do you do if it all comes unravelled? Plan ahead Having a plan and anticipating a potential issue really helps to address reputational damage and ensure that your side of the story is told when things go wrong,” says Nathalie Agnew, MD of Muckle Media PR, which works with a number of technology firms. Delayed responses have the potential to expose you to possible legal action, brand damage and regulatory scrutiny Ms Agnew suggests having a preformed crisis team in place which is able to help address the problem quickly and consider who you need to communicate with and when. Act fast David Kennerley, senior manager for Threat Research at Webroot, says: “Previously, companies would try to keep data breaches private to reduce the impact on their reputation. Paddy Power, for example, waited four years before finally telling 650,000 customers that their personal data had been compromised back in August 2010.” But, he adds: “Outrage from those affected has prompted change, and organisations now understand that the best way to protect their reputation is to be honest and share details as and when they emerge. This then allows those affected to take the necessary steps required to reduce the impact on them, such as changing passwords and cancelling bankcards.” Build in a positive message, if appropriate, such as the number of happy customers you have supported to date Delayed responses also have the potential to expose you to possible legal action, brand damage and regulatory scrutiny, says Farzad Henareh, MD of Stericycle ExpertSOLUTIONS, which provides reputation management and recall process solutions for businesses and brands. Tell the truth “Customers and partners want to hear the truth as early as possible,” says Mr Kennerley. “It’s becoming more important for organisations to be as factual as possible when discussing ongoing breaches or investigations. \"It’s better, although understandably difficult, to give a worst-case scenario, rather than downplaying an attack for customers to hear later it was far worse.” Offer a solution Sarah Owen, MD of consultancy Pumpkin, says: “If something negative has happened, tell people how you are going to address the issue in order to stop or at least limit the possibility of it happening again. This allows consumer confidence to start being restored and rebuilt.” Social media can make or break your brand image. Get it right and even a potential disaster can be turned to your advantage Ms Agnew agrees: “Build in a positive message, if appropriate, such as the number of happy customers you have supported to date without any issues to demonstrate if this is a one-off.\" Get social Social media has radically changed how consumers and businesses interact. If someone isn’t happy with your product or service, they will let the whole world know. James Moffat, MD of digital marketing agency The Organic Agency, says: “Social is one of your best tools for limiting damage and repairing your reputation. Make sure you’re always listening, be ready to react fast, and be prepared to say sorry and make amends publicly.” He adds: “Social media can make or break your brand image. Get it right and even a potential disaster can be turned to your advantage and improve brand image and loyalty.” Respond to messages, think carefully about the wording and remember that once it’s out there it’s liable to be screengrabbed so there’s no denying you ever said it. • For more advice on preparing your business for the tech challenges of the future, visit HP BusinessNow Discover more tips and advice for SMEs: • How you can protect your business • What do micropayments mean for SMEs? • Online payment advice for SMEs • Urica: a quick fix for slow payments? • Top 10 cashflow tips for SMEs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T17:20:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
