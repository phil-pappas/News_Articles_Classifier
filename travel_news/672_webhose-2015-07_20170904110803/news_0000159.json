Leonardo DiCaprio spent his holiday in the Canadian Arctic. — Facebook/AFP Relaxnews pic \nThough not top of mind as a vacation destination for celebrities, Pond Inlet touts itself as one of Canada’s true \"jewels of the north\" for its wild landscape: mountain ranges in the distance, glaciers and fjords. \nBetween May and August, the area receives midnight sun – when the sun never fully sets – and temperatures hover between 5 and 15 C (41 to 59 F). July is the warmest month of the year. \nIt’s not entirely surprising that DiCaprio would be interested in the remote wilderness of the Canadian Arctic, given his outspoken advocacy as an environmental crusader and nature lover. \nIn summer, visitors can kayak among icebergs and take boat trips for sport fishing. Pond Inlet is also famous for its narwhal-watching; the marine animals are known as the unicorns of the sea for their long, pointy horns. \nThe region is also home to beluga and orca whales, ringed and harp seals, caribou, arctic foxes, wolves, ptarmigan birds and polar bears, as well as a migratory bird sanctuary, Bylot Island. \nDuring winter months, the area is popular for cross-country skiing, igloo camping, snow mobile and dog team tours. \nIt’s not the first time DiCaprio has spent time in the far reaches of the Canadian north. \nLast year he did the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge in northern Alberta, near Lake Athabasca while touring the oil sands. \nHe also spent a few months in the Canadian Arctic shooting the film \"The Revenant\" about a fur trader who fights to survive in the wilderness after being mauled by a bear and left for dead by his companions. — AFP Relaxnews More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T17:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T18:12:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
