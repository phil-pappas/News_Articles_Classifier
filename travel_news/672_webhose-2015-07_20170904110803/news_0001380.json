They say noise effects would be minimal.\nOriginally published as Airport plan shot out of the sky", "external_links": ["http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/gold-coast-airport-ils-plan-opposed-by-qantas-jetstar/story-fnihsrf2-1227447093686"], "published": "2015-07-19T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T11:47:17.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
