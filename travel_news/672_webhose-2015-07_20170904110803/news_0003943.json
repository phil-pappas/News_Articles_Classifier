It will be our job in the future to organize frequent delegations to visit at all levels, to bring our people closer and to make them aware of the potential that exits in our relations,” said Ambassador Eke. \nAlso present during the meeting were the Secretary General in the Office of the President, Mrs. Lise Bastienne; the President's Diplomatic Adviser, Ambassador Callixte D'Offay; the Principal Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Maurice Loustau Lalanne; and the Turkish embassy's defense attache, Captain Hakan Tolunguc. \nAmbassador Deniz Eke is based in Nairobi. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
