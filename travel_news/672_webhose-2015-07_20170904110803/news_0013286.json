However, my situation has changed and I'm going to Thailand instead. Now...I'd already booked the flights to Delhi and gotten the visa, and am now in the situation where I'm having to stay over for a night between my arrival and departure (to Bangkok). Now, if I weren't returning to India, that wouldn't be a problem since I could just use the visa I'd already gotten. However, I need to return to Delhi to fly back again, in which case I run into trouble. As far as I can tell, I'll need to apply for another visa, a transit visa this time for use on the first time through, although I'm not sure they'll be too happy about that, since I should probably have applied for a multiple entry one. Anyway...any advice would be much appreciated. Sadly I don't think I can do the Transit without Visa trick since I'm using two different airlines. Thanks, What visa have you got ? john", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T22:32:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
