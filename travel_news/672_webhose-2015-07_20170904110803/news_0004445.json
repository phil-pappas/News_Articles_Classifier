If they were travelling for leisure, they can go straight to the Immigration counter and get their passports stamped.” \n\nHowever, TTG Asia e-Daily have been told that a Caucasian business traveller was able to sail through immigration without a visa. \n\nThe guideline also stipulated that travellers were “allowed in and out” from five international airports and four seaports, namely the airports of Jakarta, Bali, Medan, Surabaya, Batam, and seaports of Sekupang and Batam Centre, Batam, Sri Bintan and Tanjung Uban Riau. \n\nI Ketut Ardana, chairman of the Association of the Indonesian Tours and Travel Agencies (ASITA) Bali Chapter, said: “The problem our inbound tour operator members face is that travellers, especially those longhaul ones, have held their tickets long before the new regulation implemented.” \n\n“It is common for travellers to arrive in Bali and leave from Yogyakarta or Lombok, which are not visa-free entry and exit points. In such cases, travellers still need to pay for visa on arrival, although they are here for leisure,” he adds. \n\nRicky Setiawanto, director of business development, Panorama Destination, said: “We have travellers who were stopped from leaving Indonesia from Lombok airport because it was not a visa-free gateway.” \n\n“Some immigration officers do not check tickets and they let travellers in without a visa. If they had checked, they would have noticed planned departures from non-visa-free exit points and would be able to advise travellers to apply for a visa-on-arrival, which is cheaper (US$35) and less (troublesome) than having to reroute their tickets back to Bali.” \n\nArdana said ASITA Bali had sent a letter to the Immigration office and the tourism minister, requesting for the guidelines to be simplified. \n\nArief Yahya, Indonesia’s minister of tourism, acknowledged that tourism \"includes MICE, business travellers who are here for meetings, visiting projects etc; they are different from expatriates who live here to work\". \n\nHe agrees that the visa-free facility should be made available to \"these people\" and shared that his office is now in talks with the immigration office for solutions. \n\n(Additional reporting by S.Puvaneswary and Greg Lowe)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T11:26:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
