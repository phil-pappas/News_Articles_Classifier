Yang Wenzhuang, director of the family planning grass-roots guidance department under the National Health and Family Planning Commission, said the relaxation of the family planning policy in 2013, which allows parents who were only children themselves to have a second child, helped to lay a solid foundation for future adjustments to the birth rules. The number of couples who qualify is about 11 million, with nearly 70 per cent of them born after 1980, Yang said. Statistics from the National Health and Family Planning Commission show that, largely because of the policy relaxation, China had 16.8 million new births last year, 470,000 more than 2013. Yang expects a bigger increase this year. \"That helps decision-makers make more precise demographic development forecasts and buys more time for socio-economic and infrastructure preparation to welcome more babies,\" Yang said. The parents of Li Shuchun and Li Shuhan applied to have a second child However, he added that more adjustments are required to \"address a major demographic challenge facing the nation: that problems in the population structure, particularly rapid aging, affect economic growth”. By the end of last year, China had 915.8 million people of workforce age (from 16 to 59), which represents a fall of 3.71 million from 2013 and the third decline in a row. Lu Jiehua, a professor of social sciences at Peking University, warned that the nation would become a \"super-ageing society\" by 2035, when two working people will support one elderly resident and economic growth would be seriously affected because of labour shortages. \"With full recognition of the sheer challenge, China will in one or two years allow all couples to have a second child,\" he said. Chen Jian, a population scientist, agreed and projected a change even sooner. \"I think we'll see that next year,\" he said. Both Chen and Lu agreed that policy relaxation would help China slow its ageing trend, but admitted it was hard to change people's perception of reproduction. More people nowadays prefer small families, Lu said. Other factors such as finances, housing, education and age are also involved in making birth plans. Official statistics show that only 1.07 million of the 11 million eligible couples applied to have a second child by the end of last year. The idea of more children is more popular in western China and small cities than in coastal regions and large cities. • Read more about Chinese current affairs at China Watch This article was originally produced and published by China Daily.
