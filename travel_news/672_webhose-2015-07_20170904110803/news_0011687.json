Most of them were “Why?”, followed by a single “How?”. At first I thought the image – an advertisement for Bugaboo prams – was a still from a Smack the Pony sketch, in the same vein as the one where women in an open-plan office are engaged in competitive water drinking. The first women sips from a small water bottle. The second woman glugs from a litre bottle. The third picks up a water cooler refill and empties it over her face. So it is with 23-year-old Stiekema, whose physical perfection isn’t so much intimidating as downright comical in the context of a walk (jog, run, pentathlon) in the park with a small child. That impressive muscle group by her hips … I don’t even know what that bit is called; I thought only men had those. Do I have that? Even if I did, I’d like to think I would tuck it away unless it was needed – to carry bricks on. Even Mumsnetters have conceded that the supermodel looks amazing, while also questioning the reasons why she stripped off for a stroll with a Bugaboo. For a start, there’s nowhere to put the wet wipes … With that image, there’s only one message coming through loud and clear, whether we want to hear it or not. If you want to look great post-pregnancy, you gotta look great pre-pregnancy. Oh, and have your first baby when you’re 23 so that everything springs back into place. @telewonderwomen", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T03:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T22:43:24.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
