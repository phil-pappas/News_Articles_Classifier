When I was little, I had the privilege of having a very stylish father, and he repeatedly told me how to dress in an inspirational way and not a commanding one! One of the lessons that stayed with me and I think is very important: Either you have socks to your knee or not at all. And as I grew older I found a lot of pictures of my grandfather and discovered that he was even more stylish than my father, so I had a legacy I had to live up to!\nWhat is the difference between Swedish style of today and the past?\nThe greatest difference is that before “style,” everyone wore a suit. Today there are many kinds of style that are considered elegant. And that the general awareness for details has been lost but is now beginning to come back.\nDo you have some examples of fashions that turned into style?\nI think it was Yves Saint Laurent who said fashion fades but style is eternal. It is a beautiful Quote: that is both true and not. True, because style is truly eternal; not, because sometimes a detail is picked up from fashion and becomes style. A great example of this is what we in Sweden call the “toilet seat,” the double vent on a jacket. The double vent was thought of as vulgar, especially on the black-tie jacket, and is today regarded as the epitome of taste and style!\nThis is your first time being published; how does it make you feel?\nAt first extremely nervous, but later I felt only curiosity and excitement. And, of course, I learned so much about my favorite subject. To really dive into a subject that you love has been such a gratifying endeavor.\nPhoto: Courtesy of Norstedts\nWhat, in your opinion, is the most common mistake made by men, stylewise?\nToo-long pants, especially when you dress up in white or black tie. It sure can ruin the whole outfit.\nWho are your favorite icons?\nI must say Gianni Agnelli and Paul Newman. Gianni, because of his absolute elegance and his mastery of the art of sprezzatura. Paul, for just being the coolest man who ever lived.\nWhat is your favorite kind of clothing?\nI have to say black tie—it’s the perfect [look]. In a correctly worn dinner jacket, you always feel good.\nCan you give us a few examples of Swedish style icons through the years?\nH.R.H. Prince Bertil of Sweden, Duke of Halland, was extremely elegant and could pull off a perfect admiral’s uniform as well as an unbuttoned shirt and shorts while playing boules in the town square in Saint Maxima.\nThe actor and singer Sven-Bertil Taube, because he has the best-looking dinner jacket in Sweden.\nWhat would your five staple items consist of for a classic gentleman?\n- A blue suit; you can use the pants and jacket separately if you choose, and it works at a summer cocktail party as well as for business meetings.\n- Black oxford shoes: the most elegant shoes ever created. Perfect with jeans as well as with the blue suit.\n- A dinner jacket, so you can be elegant whenever you want.\n- A pair of jeans always works.\n- A white shirt: It works with all the above.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php"], "published": "2015-07-30T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T00:47:13.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
