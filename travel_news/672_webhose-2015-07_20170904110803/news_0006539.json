SERVES Four INGREDIENTS 2 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp butter 500g courgettes 3 garlic cloves 2 tsp sea salt Zest and juice of a lemon 1 tsp chilli flakes 25g basil leaves 250g ricotta 500g cooked orzo pasta Toasted flaked almonds METHOD  Coarsely grate the courgettes. Crush the garlic with the salt in a pestle and mortar to form a rough paste.  Place a heavy-bottomed pan on medium heat. If possible, use one that is not non-stick. This allows the courgettes to caramelise and brings much more flavour. Sweat the garlic paste in the oil and butter until soft. Add the lemon zest and chilli flakes and fry briefly. Add the courgettes and stir to mix. Cover the pan and cook the courgettes on a low heat for 15 to 20 minutes. They are ready when soft and jam-like. Remove from the heat. Roughly tear the basil leaves and add to the courgettes along with the lemon juice. Whisk the ricotta and fold the courgette mixture into it. You may need to loosen the sauce with a little water. Toss with the orzo. Scatter with the almonds and serve.
