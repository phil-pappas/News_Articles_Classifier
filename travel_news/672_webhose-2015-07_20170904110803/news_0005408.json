The U2 Wall \nThe graffiti-covered wall at Windmill Lane studios stands as a testament to where the iconic Dublin band recorded some of their greatest tunes. \nA music lover must-see, this fan wall is more of an accidental gallery than a contrived piece of art. \nSituated at Sir John Rogerson's Quay, it's covered in cartoons, lyrics and declarations of love from home and abroad for the greatest band on the planet. \nWhile the studio itself was demolished in April to make way for apartments, the wall - much like the band - remains intact. \n2. National Leprechaun Museum \nIf you fancy something a little more left of center, why not visit the cute National Leprechaun Museum? \nLearn the history of the leprechaun and other figures of Irish mythology at the museum on Jervis St. \nVenture inside the house of a giant, find the crock of gold at the end of the rainbow and even learn how to spot fairy folk in everyday life. \nEvery bit as mad as it sounds. \n3. Grangegorman Military Cemetery \nSome might find visiting a graveyard spooky but this cemetery feels more like a chilled out sanctuary. \nHistory buffs will enjoy learning about the World War I casualties buried throughout the graveyard. \nThe Graveyard is on Blackhorse Avenue, off the Navan Road so if it's a nice day pack a picnic and head to the Phoenix Park afterwards. \n4. The Forty Foot \nSwimmers have been diving off this bathing spot at the southern tip of Dublin Bay for over 250 years. \nIf you really want an authentic experience - and can stomach the mortification along with the cold - hop into the water naked as this bathing area was traditionally a nudist bathing haunt. \nAfter drying off, head to the Martello Tower once inhabited by Oliver John St Gogarty and James Joyce right next to the baths. \nNow the James Joyce Tower and Museum, it's also where the opening of Joyce's iconic novel Ulysses is set. \n5. Experience a GAA Match \nYou'd be hard pushed to find a more exciting day out than watching a Gaelic football or hurling match in Croke Park. \nCheck the GAA website for fixtures so you can catch a game during your visit - or check out Experience Gaelic Games for a more hands on experience. \n6. City of a Thousand Welcomes \nDublin is considered one of the friendliest cities in the world, so who better to show you around than a local with insider knowledge? \nThe City of a Thousand Welcomes is an innovative scheme which helps tourists connect with locals. \nMore than 3,000 Dubliners have signed up as ambassadors to guide tourists around the city. \nExperience the capital with a local by your side and make sure they bring you for a pint of the black stuff. \n7. Take a tour around Kilmainham Gaol \nIf history is your thing, a visit to Kilmainham Gaol is unmissable. \nA tour through this former prison where 1916 rebels were executed will give you a real feel for Ireland's resistance to English rule. \nYou'll be horrified by tales of life and conditions of 18th and 19th century prisoners, where death in the cells was common. \n8. The Little Museum of Dublin \nThis adorable little museum tells the incredible tale of Dublin in the 20th century. \nLaunched in 2011 with a public appeal for historic objects, this little gem has gone from strength to strength since. \nThe Irish public have responded generously and today there are over 5,000 artifacts in the collection. \nChildren attend free civics classes here every morning. The museum also launched the City of a Thousand Welcomes project. \n9. Dublin Literary Walking Tour \nImmerse yourself in the lives of our greatest writers like James Joyce and Jonathan Swift. \nTour participants visit the places where these famous Dublin writers lived, taking in some of the city's most iconic landmarks at the same time. \nYou'll learn which writer was a university athletics champion and who stole and married the gal of a fellow famous novelist. \nLiterary idols like James Joyce, Johnathan Swift, Bram Stoker and Oscar Wilde will come to life on this tour, leaving you feeling both learned and cultural. \n10. Howth loop cliff walk \nThe views on this breathtaking walk are simply spectacular. On a clear day you can see all the way out to Wicklow Head - and all it will cost you is the price of a Dart ticket.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T05:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T11:08:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
