The Reporting Tab allows the collection and management of booking reports, while with the Employees Tab, administrators can manage approved and pending employees who have been permitted to book trips through Airbnb. \n\nThe global launch of the Business Travel programme comes on the heels of a 700 per cent year-on-year growth. Since it went live last July, more than 250 companies have joined up, including companies like Google and SoundCloud. \n\nCompanies that sign up for Airbnb's Business Travel programme between now and September 1, 2015 will be eligible for a special promotion. Business travellers at enrolled companies will receive US$50 in Airbnb credit to use towards their first corporate travel booking. \n\nMore information is available on the programme website .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T13:44:10.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
