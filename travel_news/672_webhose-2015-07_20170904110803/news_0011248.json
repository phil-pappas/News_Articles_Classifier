The respected San Francisco, California-based Kimpton chain of boutique hotels and restaurants is suddenly undergoing wrenching changes, including a mass downsizing in San Francisco that could possibly reach all the way to Chicago, where Kimpton currently operates four hotels — the Burnham, the Palomar, the Monaco and the Allegro — with one more tentatively set to open in the Loop in 2016. The upheaval at Kimpton comes just six months after lodgings behemoth InterContinental Hotels (NYSE: IHG) acquired the independent boutique chain for a reported $430 million. Within the past two weeks, Kimpton — without warning — suddenly dropped four of six hotel properties in its hometown San Francisco. The four properties are now being managed by what appear to be other, less well-known boutique hotel operators. The two remaining San Francisco Kimpton hotels are a major come-down from no fewer than 16 properties Kimpton operated there as recently as 2001, where the chain had 2,785 rooms in the city. Now the number of guest rooms in San Francisco is down to 549. On its website, InterContinental boasts its portfolio includes more than 4,900 hotels and 724,000 guest rooms worldwide. Kimpton's public relations staff did not respond to repeated attempts to reach them for comment. Nor did Kimpton Group CEO Mike DeFino respond to an email. Members of the Kimpton Karma loyalty program who had booked upcoming reservations at one of the Kimpton properties that have changed hands in San Francisco were notified via email just a couple of hours before the hotels' new operators took control and were bluntly informed that no existing reservations at those properties beyond early August would be honored for credit in the loyalty program. One traveler blindsided by the changes posted a TripAdvisor.com comment online noting he made a reservation at Kimpton's former Hotel Monaco in San Francisco when it was still a Kimpton property earlier this month, only to arrive at the hotel a couple of days later and find it was being operated by a new company. Just about a month ago, Kimpton CEO Mike DeFino 's office also sent an email to Kimpton Karma members to update them on the merger with InterContinental Hotels . In that memo, DeFrino indicated Kimpton intended to keep its headquarters in San Francisco, because the city had been a source of inspiration as the Kimpton brand has evolved over decades. But that headquarters location decision seems to have been directly contradicted by developments in recent days. The Kimpton chain was founded in San Francisco in 1981 by William Kimpton, who had a love for buying up vintage buildings and transforming them into colorful, quirky boutique hotels. Chicago was one of the early markets that Kimpton expanded into in the Midwest in the late 1990s, and over nearly two decades the small chain grew its presence in Chicago to include four hotel properties and several restaurants. With 59 hotels still in its portfolio nationwide, Kimpton is said to be the largest chain of boutique hotels in the United States. But given the strange and disturbing turn of events in San Francisco, it's impossible to say with certainty whether Kimpton will continue to operate its existing Chicago properties or whether it will in fact open a fifth hotel next year in a vintage building at 39 S.LaSalle St. in the city's financial district. For the moment, no one at Kimpton headquarters is talking. \nWant Chicago Media & Marketing   Industries", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T23:59:30.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
