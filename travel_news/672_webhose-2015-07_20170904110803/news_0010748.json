The non-reciprocal trade preference programme established in 2000, was set to end in September this year after the 2012 extension saw some goods from Kenya and other sub-Saharan Africa gaining access to the US market duty-free.\nAdan Mohamed said Monday that Kenya was keen to expand exports to the US from 39 billion shillings last year. The Kenya Association of Manufacturers has lauded tax measures the government has introduced to revamp the manufacturing sector and protect local industries.\nHowever, accessing the East African Community (EAC) market has still been an uphill task, something they want addressed.\nThe Minister said the passing of the Special Economic Zones Bill which is now in its Second Reading stage in Parliament will see local industries gaining access to the regional market to counter Export Processing Zone (EPZ) limitations.\nAdan said 20 firms, some from Asia, had expressed interest in investing 8.0 billion shillings in the textile and apparel industry.\nRelated Posts Siemens to realign regional organization and strengthen corporate units Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building Norwegian announced three long-haul routes to America MIA Director, National Counterparts Travel To Washington, D.c.
