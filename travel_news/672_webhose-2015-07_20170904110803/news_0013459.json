View Archive Facebook Google+ RSS On partners who use your past against you:\nWhen I was young and naive I shared some information with the man who became my first husband, and he seldom failed to mention it when we were arguing. I came to realize that people who do this are basically insecure and have to put the other person down to feel superior.\nWhen I told my now-husband something private that I was not proud of, his reaction was, “That must have been what you needed at the time.” It was never mentioned again. The most important thing to remember is self-confident people do not need to belittle others. Steer clear of the ones who do.\nM.\nOn divorced people as social creatures, too:\nI’m a divorced mom to an elementary-age kid. I’m a social creature — love dinner parties, open houses, family pizza nights, neighbor barbecues, weekend trips. My life was full of this as part of a married couple. But as a “divorcee,” I feel excluded from social plans. I usually only get a call to get together when hubby is working late or away on business or maybe for a moms’/girls’ night. I love and need my women friends, but I like having the men around, too.\nA few years ago, I threw myself a little birthday party (grown-up wine and tapas) and invited my social circle. Only the women showed up — hubby bowed out to watch the kids or watch the game. I was crushed; it felt like book club (I’ve got that, thanks). Same thing happened when I hosted a winter chili night — women without their plus-one, even though the invitation was clearly to both.\nWhile I often know the female half of the couple better, I make it a point for some events to invite the couple. My social life has dried up — at least anything that’s not a girls’ night — and I’m sad about it. I’d like to make a public service announcement to include the social singles in group gatherings. I promise not to flirt or infect a marriage with tantalizing tales of life after divorce, and an odd number at a dinner table is not the end of the world.\nSocial Creature\nOn avoiding the mother-in-law pitfalls:\nEven loving someone does not mean that every plan you have involving them is convenient. Propose visits with the phrase, “If it’s convenient for you . . .” or, “If that is okay with you” — and LISTEN to the answer! Or WAIT TO BE ASKED! No gazing disrespectfully at the untidy house that is normal when there are small children present, or commenting on it; or reorganizing the house to “help out,” or cleaning (e.g. digging into areas the mother would rather no guest saw); or making comments about feeding, sleep schedules, discipline, whatever.\nYour place as a mother-in-law (or a plain grandmother) is to give help where asked, visit when the baby’s family is up for it, and NOT to assume you have rights to invade their space or dictate how they will raise their children.\nListen to your own reasoning carefully and be sure that you are not projecting onto the new family your own desires. If you don’t, you ARE “that mother-in-law.”\nMichigan\nWrite to Carolyn Hax , Style, 1150 15th St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071, or tellme@washpost.com .
