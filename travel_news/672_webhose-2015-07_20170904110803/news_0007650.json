These provide insight into the background of Chinese Tusi culture and the Tusi families in Bozhou. \nZunyi, formerly Bozhou, consists of mainly Gelao and Miao. An area known for cultural exchanges between the Han and other minority group, also serving as an economic and cultural exchange. Zunyi is the most representative area of the Tusi system. \nThe Yang family built and owned of the Hailongtun castle. The history of the Yang family governing Bozhou began with their ancestor Yang Rui (Liao ethnic group, predecessor of Gelao ethnic group) who occupied Bozhou in 876, the 3rd year during Qianfu's reign in the Tang dynasty. Yang Yinglong, the last Tusi of Bozhou and the 29th governor of the Yang family, died during the Pingbo battle in 1600. The family governed the area for more than 700 years, spanning Tang, Song, Yuan and Ming dynasties. \nThe Tusi system made the autonomous rule by minorities a reality, and in a certain historical period facilitated the development of ethnic diversity, strengthened national unity, ensure borderland security, and promoted the peaceful coexistence of the central government and their local minority regimes. \nThe Hailongtun fortress was built in 1257 A.D. It was a result of the cooperation between the central government of the Song and the Yang family. Relics found at the site include buildings with traditional craftwork and feature both local ethnic characteristics and lotus patterns and ridge beasts that were usually seen in central China during that time. The government offices were built according to the official layout of the central government offices, which showed not only the status symbol but also ethnic fusion. \nBeing listed on the World Heritage List will promote studies on the Tusi culture and the history of Bozhou. Guizhou province, with its first cultural heritage site, will strengthen the preservation and excavation of historical relics within the territory, and will apply for more world cultural heritage listings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T13:22:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
