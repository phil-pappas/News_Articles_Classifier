Why not join them? \nOn June 23, the upstart carrier transitioned to a new Sabre ( SABR - Get Report ) platform, called Electronic Miscellaneous Document (EMD) that will enable sale of Virgin America ancillary products such as seat upgrades, bag check and early boarding through Expedia and the global distribution systems (GDS). The platform is now in use for Virgin's internal distribution systems, and will become available to GDS customers in the next few weeks. \nPreviously, Expedia and GDS systems could not sell ancillary products, incentivizing airlines including Virgin America to seek to limit sales to their own sites as much as possible. EMD will enable Virgin America to sell ancillary products more \"dynamically,\" offering various pricing according to time of day, day of week, route or flight. \nVirgin America CEO David Cush said the new platform will not only enable the carrier to increase its ancillary revenue but also could increase pricing transparency for all airline passengers. \nMust Read: Virgin America Likes Tough Markets But Investors Aren't So Sure \n\"We will be the first U.S. carrier to have this,\" Cush said, in an interview. \"We see a lot of opportunity to increase ancillary revenue per guest, in a way that is guest-friendly, by charging more for higher demand seats and less for lower demand seats.\" \nUnlike competitors, Virgin America will continue to avoid extra charges for about half of its seats, making those available to price-conscious travelers, families who want to sit together without paying seat fees and others.\"We think we can get to where we need to be with dynamic pricing for half the cabin,\" Cush said. Additionally, a better seat on a Virgin American trans-continental flight will cost a relatively low $50. \nCush said Sabre developed EMD because \"they want the GDS platform to continue to be a vital platform; they want to be sure the GDS channel is as competitive as possible.\" Outside of the U.S., the platform is in use by Virgin Australia. \n\"One thing it does is to provide additional transparency in shopping,\" he said. \"If others ultimately make this information available through these channels, passengers can shop based on {knowing} ancillary charges.\" For the moment, he said, \"If you want to compare airlines based on ancillary fees, there is not an efficient way to do that.\" \nIn the first quarter of 2015, Virgin Atlantic ancillary revenue totaled $37 million or $24.27 per passenger. Over the past two calendar years, the carrier's ancillary revenue grew to $154 million or $23.97 per passenger in 2014 from $127 million or $20.27 per passenger in 2013. \nVirgin's per passenger ancillary revenue was ahead of the $17.49 average for 63 global airlines cited in a report published Monday by IdeaWorks, a consulting firm that tracks ancillary revenue. The report said the 63 carriers reported 2014 ancillary revenue of $38.1 billion, up 21% from a year earlier, while the per-passenger average rose 8.5%. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T13:58:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
