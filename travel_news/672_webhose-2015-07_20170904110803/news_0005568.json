This will be my 4th trip. I've been to Ladakh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Agra and Rajasthan. I have an idea of landing in Delhi and taking an overnight train to Amritsar, From Amritsar I want o continue east to Khajuraho, Varanasi and finally Sundarbans National Park. I would fly home from Kolkata. I know this is a very big stretch. The other idea is to concentrate on Varanasi, and east, include time in Assam and skip Amritsar. Although Amritsar is very high on my list of places I want to see.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T05:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T09:04:26.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
