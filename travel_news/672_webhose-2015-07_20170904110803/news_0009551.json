The balloons, including some spectacular designs such as a French chateau and rotund cartoon character Obelix, took off from Chambley-Bussieres air base to beat the previous record for simultaneous hot air balloon flights. \nHot-air balloons fly near Chambley-Bussieres airbase, eastern France, on July 26, 2015, on the first day of the international air-balloon meeting \"Lorraine Mondial Air Ballons\".

The biggest dangers for the balloons, which were arrayed in parallel lines six kilometres (four miles) long for the take off, was that two of them might collide causing tears in their fabric, something that has happened twice since 1989, he added. \nHot-air balloons fly near Chambley-Bussieres airbase, eastern France, on July 26, 2015, on the first day of the international air-balloon meeting \"Lorraine Mondial Air Ballons\".
