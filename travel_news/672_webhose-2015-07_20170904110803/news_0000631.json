Paris is set to build its first skyscraper in 40 years. Picture: Herzog & de Meuron. Source: Facebook \nPARISIANS are known to voice their opinions and this latest issue has got many of them riled up. \nFor the first time in 40 years Paris is building a new skyscraper, to the horror of many of its residents. \nThe controversial design known as Tour Triangle has been given the go ahead by the Paris city council after initially being rejected in November 2014. \nSet to stand 180 metres high, it will feature a 120 room hotel and 70,000 square metres of office space. The $720 million project has been designed by architects Herzog & de Meuron who were the creative forces behind Beijing’s “Bird’s Nest” stadium for the 2008 Olympics and London’s Tate Modern art museum. Tour Triangle has divided Paris residents. Picture: Herzog & de Meuron. Source: Facebook The controversial design will change Paris’ skyline. Picture: Herzog & de Meuron. Source: Facebook \nThe first and last skyscraper to be built in inner Paris was the Tour Montparnasse building in 1973. Standing 210 metres high with 59 floors, it is deemed an eyesore in Paris. Locals are often heard to say that the best view of Paris is from the Montparnasse as you can’t see it. \nTour Triangle will be located in Porte de Versailles on the city’s south-western fringe. It has been opposed by residents of the 15th arrondissement who are unhappy about having to live next to the monstrosity. Politicians have also criticised the design for not being energy efficient or in balance with Paris’ housing requirements. \nThe skyscraper is set to be completed in 2018. The building will be home to a hotel and office spaces. Picture: Herzog & de Meuron. Source: Facebook Not since Montparnasse has inner city Paris had a skyscraper. Picture: Herzog & de Meuron.
