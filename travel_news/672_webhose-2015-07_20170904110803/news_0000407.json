With the summer holidays in full swing, qualifying rounds can be found aplenty across the UK. This week, clubs such as Rye, Romanby, Droitwich and Windermere will be hosting one-round qualifiers as part of their junior club competitions. When qualifying closes on September 7 we will know the make up of the finalists (12 boys and nine girls) for the 30th running of the Championships a month later. For the third year, Quinta do Lago will play host to the 54-hole strokeplay event, home to three pristine Championship courses, with the Ria Formosa Lagoon serving as a stunning backdrop. As things stand, it is likely that the top four in the boys and leading three girls on our Telegraph BMW qualifying leaderboard will be making the flight to the Algarve. Leading the way in the girls’ event is Meon Valley’s Emma Allen following her -5 gross score at Nizels. Her round formed part of a trophy-winning performance at the Sir Henry Cooper Junior Masters, duly recognised as one of the leading under-18 Championships in the world. “I’ve watched the Telegraph finals on TV and know that some fantastic players have won,” said Allen, fresh off the plane from representing England at the European Girls’ Championship in the Czech Republic. “It would be great to be part of it and have a chance of following in their footsteps. “With the help of my coach, Martin Butcher, I’ve started to see the results to back up my hard work. Winning the Henry Cooper Masters was an obvious highlight as well as finishing 15th in the Europeans.” In the boys’ event, Sussex’s Marco Penge leads the way following his table-topping -7 score at Copt Heath. The Goodwood teenager, who won the Scottish Open strokeplay in June, replicated Allen at Nizels by winning the boys’ event, which included a hole-in-one in his third round. Despite the obvious qualities at the top of our qualifying leaderboard, boys and girls of all abilities are welcome to enter in the hope of making our prestigious three-round tournament. A list of qualifying events can be found on the Where to play page. This year’s finalists will again be playing on the 6,776-yard North Course, which opened last year after being given a fresh makeover by renowned American architect Beau Welling, in collaboration with European Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley. Our long association also continues with Sky Sports, who will produce a highlights' programme for the event in the Algarve, while the finalists will again be staying at the Monte da Quinta Suites. In all, Quinta do Lago is home to three pristine Championship courses, with the Ria Formosa Lagoon serving as a stunning backdrop – and is set within 2,000 acres of Unesco-protected parkland.
