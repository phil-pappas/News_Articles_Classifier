Therefore, your guess is a good as mine as to what days the show tapes. A specific list of days is given to those lucky enough to get through by phone to request tickets. I can tell you a few things: tapings occur only on weekdays and there are generally 2 shows on taping days -- you'll need to arrive by 7:00 a.m. for the morning taping, and 11:00 a.m. for the afternoon taping. Oprah's season generally airs from August - November and January - May. \nGetting Oprah tickets online: Oprah tickets are generally requested by filling out an online reservation form. The first step is to sign up for a free membership on Oprah.com . Then you'll have to check back periodically on the Oprah reservations website to find out status of the \"reservation window.\" Generally the window displays only for the following month. If the window is open, you can then fill out an online request for a reservation.One day after the reservation window closes, requests for seats will be randomly selected, and the lucky group will receive an email notification -- be sure to confirm the reservation within 48 hours of the receipt of that email. If you are not selected, you can try again during the next available reservation window. \nGetting last minute tickets: There is a small opportunity to get tickets at the last minute by filling in an online form request, but there's a catch -- the \"Audience Department\" is generally looking for someone that has a story to tell that matches that show's topic. The upside is that perhaps you'll get to be on television to tell your story or ask the guest a question. Current shows with possible last minute reservations can be found here . \nWhat to know about Oprah tickets: The Oprah Winfrey Show tapes at Harpo Studios, located at 1058 West Washington. You must be 18 or older to attend. A photo ID is required. Everyone goes through security when entering the studio (i.e., your purse or bag will be checked) \nBe On the Show: Of course, the best way to be at a taping of the Oprah Winfrey show is to actually be a part of it! The producers put up a list of regularly updated show topics , along with an online form for you to tell your story and potentially be a guest. Just make sure to tell the truth, we know what happens when people lie to Oprah .
