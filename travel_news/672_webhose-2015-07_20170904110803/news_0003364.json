It's a lot less effort travelling to parts of Australia now with direct flights out of Toowoomba to Sydney. \n\"Uluru is proving to be very popular at the moment. I think we all underestimate the power of seeing an Australian icon for the first time. Unfortunately many of us take what's in our backyard for granted, so I just can't wait to see it for myself one day.\" \nHowever, Jessica's visit to Uluru will have to wait, as her next trip is a long-awaited visit to the Grand Canyon. \n\"I recently went to New York and did a helicopter flight over the city, as well as a Segway tour of Washington DC's monuments. I'm planning on doing the Grand Canyon in similar fashion. I've planned another helicopter flight as well as a white-water rafting adventure. \n\"I also can't wait to go to Lake Louise in Canada. The list never ends!\" \nVisit your local Flight Centre for more ultimate journey ideas and if you're looking to travel to the USA, Canada or Central or South America.
