Photo: James Brickwood\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott is expected to make his first public comments about the scandal later on Saturday. But Fairfax Media understands he is standing by his Speaker.\nAt a closed door event on Friday Mr Abbott reportedly dismissed the scandal as \"village gossip\". However the Prime Minister's office says that was not an accurate reflection of what he said.\nCoalition ministers and MPs are quietly furious that the scandal has derailed their attacks on Labor over union corruption, and some have described her position as increasingly untenable.\nBut Finance Minister Mathias Cormann says he strongly disagrees with that assessment.\n\"From where I sit Bronwyn Bishop is doing a very good job as Speaker,\" he told Sky News on Saturday. \"The key here is the Speaker has reimbursed the claim.\"\nMrs Bishop caved to political and public pressure and paid back the money, along with a $1300 fine, but has admitted no wrongdoing.\nLabor believes the case hinges on whether Mrs Bishop signed a Presiding Officer's Charter Certification form. The form requires the Speaker to confirm that a charter is for her \"office holder duties\" and states that knowingly giving false or misleading information is a serious criminal offence.\nSenator Cormann said he would have no oversight or involvement with his department's investigation.\nIndependent senator Nick Xenophon hopes the \"choppergate\" scandal will be a catalyst for broader changes to entitlements. He wants greater transparency and an independent umpire to deal with complaints. He also wants tougher penalties when mistakes are made.\nLabor wrote to the AFP shortly after Fairfax Media exclusively revealed that the political lobbyist who was paid to arrange the chopper was the best friend of Mrs Bishop's most senior adviser , chief of staff and spokesman Damien Jones.\nLate on Friday Mr Jones said Mrs Bishop would not comment on the referral until the AFP decided whether to investigate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T03:32:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
