Among those included traffic, safety, privacy and potential water contamination. \nResidents using well-water systems are worried that waste from the wild animal park could contaminate the soil and water stored underground. \nDespite the questions raised, the township granted 29-year-old owner Adam Guiher a conditional-use permit that allows him to use the land for the park provided he follows the necessary federal and state regulations for operation. \nGuiher says the park located near Grove City about 45 miles north of Pittsburgh will house 100 species. \nInformation from: Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, http://pghtrib.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T22:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T00:28:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
