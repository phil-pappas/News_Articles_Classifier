Operating under a franchise agreement with Sojourn Hotels, Hotel Indigo® York opens its doors on Walmgate, a thriving foodie destination and the birthplace of York’s chocolate making empire.\nThe intimate 101 room hotel is perfectly situated within prime reach of some of the city’s most outstanding restaurants and bars, boutiques, artisan shops, famous tea-rooms, museums and galleries. From the building design to the hotel’s artwork and locally-inspired menus, every Hotel Indigo property is unique and takes influences from its surrounding neighbourhood. Celebrating the true flavours and locality of Yorkshire, Hotel Indigo York has partnered with the award winning Yorkshire Meatball Co. — one of the UK’s only speciality meatball restaurants, offering guests delicious and unique dishes using the tastiest local produce. The restaurant serves meat, fish, vegetarian and sweet balls all hand-rolled in-house as well as a wide selection of Yorkshire craft beers.\nTom Rowntree, IHG’s Vice President for Hotel Indigo, Europe said: “We’re enormously proud to be opening our first Hotel Indigo property in York. Hotel Indigo provides a refreshingly local experience for guests through stylish design, locations in unique and culturally-rich neighbourhoods, topped off with intimate, personalised service. We’re the place to discover something new and feel inspired whether you’re a local, or a visitor travelling for business or leisure.”\nShiraz Boghani, Chairman of Splendid Hospitality Group said: “We are delighted to be opening our third hotel in York. There are over 30 visitor attractions in York and it is a testament to how hard York works as a City that there is something to appeal to everybody who visits.“\nAt Hotel Indigo York, design nuances echo the neighbourhood’s cultural charm and have been woven throughout the hotel to create eye-catching décor. Interiors hint at Walmgate’s chocolate heritage, including Rowntrees (the famous English confectioner started life in this neighbourhood in 1725).\nCentre stage on the ground floor is a red brick feature wall, influenced by the architecture of Walmgate which has been admired over the centuries by visitors to York.\nMike Sweeting, Hotel Manager, Hotel Indigo York commented: “The neighbourhood of Walmgate provides the perfect base for exploring York’s rich cultural heritage. With our chocolate inspired décor and emphasis on real local flavours we are ready to give guests an authentic Yorkshire welcome.”\nJust as no two neighbourhoods are alike, no two Hotel Indigo properties are alike. Each is designed to uniquely reflect the local culture, character and history of the surrounding area. Hotel Indigo York creates a truly memorable experience by artfully combining the modern design and intimate service associated with a boutique hotel with the conveniences and consistencies you can expect from staying at one of the world’s largest hotel groups. There are currently 18 Hotel Indigo properties in Europe (which makes Hotel Indigo York the 19th) and 11 in the pipeline. Hotel Indigo York joins 9 IHG hotels in Yorkshire.\nRelated Posts InterContinenetal Hotels Group Signs First Hotel Indigo in Finland InterContinental Hotels Group launches promotional campaign “The Big Win” InterContinental Hotels Group holds educational event for investors and analysts in London Norwegian announced three long-haul routes to America First Holiday Inn Hotel Opens in the Historic City of Kanazawa, Japan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T07:49:45.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
