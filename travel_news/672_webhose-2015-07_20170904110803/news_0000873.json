Uber accounted for 55 percent of ground transportation receipts compared with taxis at 43 percent. \nThat's a big jump from just the beginning of the year. In the first quarter, Uber Technologies had 46 percent of receipts tracked by Certify compared with 53 percent for taxis. \nCertify based its finding on the 28 million trip receipts its North American clients submit each year. It does not include receipts from business travelers whose companies use other services to track expenses. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T07:43:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
