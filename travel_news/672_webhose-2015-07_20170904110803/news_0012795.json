A classified U.S. intelligence map that shows computer hacks by China to almost 700 public and private targets in the U.S. includes a number of attacks in Florida. The National Security Agency map obtained by NBC News includes a red dot for each successful “computer intrusion” of a corporate, private or U.S. government target over a five-year period, the network said. The FBI said the Chinese are targeting power and telecommunications systems, as well as private individuals. The agency is investigating hundreds of attacks across the U.S. The map was part of a NSA briefing prepared by the NSA Threat Operations Center in February 2014, an intelligence source told NBC News. The briefing highlighted China's interest in Google and defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin , and in air traffic control systems, the network reports. The state with the most attacks, according to the map, is California.

Florida Legislators unsure how to go about redistricting After reaching an agreement this week with voting-rights groups, Florida lawmakers face the chore of going into special session in October to redraw Senate districts. But the agreement with the League of Women Voters of Florida, Common Cause Florida and others that legally challenged the Senate's current map doesn't list the districts that have to be changed. And the opponents' objections have encompassed 28 districts — fully 70 percent of the districts represented in the 40-member Senate. A joint memo issued Tuesday by Senate President Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, and House Speaker Steve Crisafulli, R-Merritt Island, didn't give many specifics. It simply said the Legislature's staff will draw a map \"that complies with the Florida Supreme Court's ruling [on the congressional districts] and all other relevant legal standards.\" Read more here from the Jacksonville Business Journal . Analyst: Moynihan is the right man for BofA If you ask Dick Bove , he'll tell you Brian Moynihan is just the guy to run Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC), the second-largest bank in Central Florida. The equity research analyst at Rafferty Capital Markets has been supportive of BofA for years. And yesterday Bove wrote about Moynihan’s success as CEO of the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank in an op-ed column for CNBC . “This [banking] knowledge, combined with a keen intellect, allowed him to achieve the almost impossible when he took over as CEO of Bank of America in 2010 in what arguably were the darkest days in the bank's almost 200 years of existence,” Bove wrote. The column comes a week after BofA announced a series of management changes . Bove argues that those changes are a good sign that the second-largest bank in the country is moving toward revenue growth.
