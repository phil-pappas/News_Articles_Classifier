Insect species that might be spotted on this route include rare slender Scotch burnet moth, the chimney sweep moth and the dark green fritillary butterfly. The coastal path - tricky to negotiate in places - offers breathtaking views of Staffa and the Treshnish Isles. Fritillary butterflies may be seen en route. Photo: Alamy Emily Wilkins, National Trust for Scotland ranger, said that early summer is the best time to spot the Slender Scotch Burnet Moth, which feed on the Bird’s Foot Trefoil. \"Wildflowers in all colours are also in abundance, and will be until the end of the summer.” • 10 reasons to visit Scotland this summer Grade: Rough ground and challenging Terrain: A rough and, in places, steep path which includes a steep descent to a beach via an iron ladder. Please take extreme care and bear in mind that dogs cannot descend the ladder. The path ends at the fossil tree and it is then very difficult to progress beyond this. Distance: 5 miles / 8.5km Time: At least six hours OS Map: Landranger Sheet 48 The route Start: Tiroran car park 1. Start your walk at Tiroran car park. The name Tiroran may mean ‘the house of Oran’. Oran was an early medieval priest and follower of St Columba. 2. Scobull School and Dun Schobull. The name Scobull is old Norse for Scob’s farm. Children used to walk barefoot to school here from Burg bothy. On the hill behind the school is the Iron Age fortification Dun Scobuill. • Great days out in the UK 3. Coffin cairns - Each of these cairns represents one generation of the MacGillivray family. They would rest a coffin here on the way to the graveyard. The coastal scenery is brooding and dramatic Photo: Alamy 4. Ruined townships - Culliemore and Salachry were once busy settlements – 35 people lived at Culliemore alone. In the mid-19th century they were cleared to make way for sheep. Ruins can also be seen of shieling huts where cattle were taken to graze in the summer. The grass fields, now rich in flowers, give a glimpse of the plants that thrived before intensive farming began. In spring the slopes are covered in bluebells and primroses. 5. Tavool House - this was the ‘big house’ on the Ardmeanach peninsula, and once belonged to the Bell family who spent their summers here and provided employment for local people. • Eagle watching on Mull 6. Burg farm and bothy - Over 50 people thrived at Burg until the clearances of the 1840s. Remains of stone and turf blackhouses can still be seen along the track. The tiny bothy, built in the 1880s and now owned by the National Trust for Scotland, once housed eight members of the MacGillivray family. Later they built the larger farmhouse and four generations of the family farmed here. During the 1930s and World War Two, they ran an experimental farm, trying out agricultural methods that other island communities might learn from. Many of the fields – once full of potatoes, turnips and oats – have now been reclaimed by bracken. Evidence for farming at Burg dates back to Neolithic times and two possible Bronze Age cairns can be seen on the beach below the farm. 7. Dun Bhuirg - situated on a cliff edge, this unexcavated defended stone roundhouse is one of nine such sites around the edge of Loch Scridain, all thought to date back 2,000 years to the Iron Age. Each was the focus for a farming community. The walls are over 4m thick, and the base of a flight of stairs is visible. On a clear day the Outer Hebrides are visible from Bearraich (in background) Photo: Alamy 8. Coastal grasslands - the coastal grasslands are home to one of Scotland’s rarest moths, the slender Scotch burnet. Flying mainly in June, this red and black moth feeds on birdsfoot trefoil. Flowering plants such as thyme, wild carrot and kidney vetch provide a mass of colour in summer. 9. Bearraich - the summit of Bearraich provides excellent views to Ben More in the east and over Ulva, Staffa and the Treshnish Isles to Tiree. On a clear day you can see the Outer Hebrides. The basalt rocks provide ideal habitats for some rare plants, including Iceland purslane, purple saxifrage, mountain avens and globeflower. You may see golden and sea eagles soaring around the cliffs. MacCulloch's fossil tree is the impression of a 50-million year-old tree is embedded in an old lava flow Photo: Alamy 10. The impression of a 50-million year-old tree is embedded in an old lava flow. Over the years, souvenir hunters have damaged what remains of the tree trunk. Please don’t pick away pieces of the fossil. Signs of other fossil trees canbe seen in the beach below the path. The columnar structures that fan out like the spokes of a wheel formed as the lava cooled.
