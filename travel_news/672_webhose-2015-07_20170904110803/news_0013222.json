Fashionable since Queen Victoria’s time, the sponge cake remains the home baker’s star turn. In this deliciously light yet exotic version, which uses his own Heston from Waitrose Fruit Cup, Heston revamps the traditional cake by incorporating another seasonal favourite, rhubarb. Of his creation, the Michelin-starred chef says: ‘The addition of some lively, fruity fillings can transform the humble sponge. Here a rhubarb and berry jam with coriander seeds, and a dusting of strawberry powder create a truly spectacular cake. Your taste buds will be amused.’ Heston's rhubard sponge Ingredients Sponge • 3 medium Waitrose British Blacktail eggs • 130g caster sugar • 85g plain flour • 1⁄2 tsp baking powder • 60g unsalted butter, melted • 50g whipping cream • 6g coriander leaves • Zests of 1 orange • 1⁄2 lemon Rhubarb layer • 200g rhubarb, cut into 3cm chunks • 85g caster sugar • 1 tbsp lemon juice • 50g Waitrose Seriously Fruity Raspberry Coulis • 2g pectin • 90g Heston from Waitrose Fruit Cup • 170g strawberry jam • 2 tsp toasted coriander seeds, coarsely crushed Fruit cup cream • 160g whipping cream • 20g icing sugar, sieved • 20g Heston from Waitrose Fruit Cup Strawberry powder • 7g Waitrose Cooks’ Homebaking Freeze Dried Strawberries • 7g icing sugar • Zest of 1 orange Method 1. Preheat the oven to 170C/gas mark 3. Grease and line a 15cm round cake tin. Mix the eggs and sugar in a bowl until thick and creamy. Separately, sieve the flour with the baking powder and a pinch of salt. 2. Blitz the melted butter, whipping cream and coriander using a hand blender. Fold the flour mix into the egg mix in three stages. Drizzle in the butter mix, adding the zests. Fold gently. Pour into the cake tin. Bake for 25 minutes or until golden and a skewer, inserted, comes out clean. Cool on a cake rack. 3. For the rhubarb layer, cook the rhubarb in a pan over a medium heat with 50g of the sugar, the lemon juice and coulis (8-10 minutes). Mix the rest of the sugar with the pectin. Add this to the rhubarb and stir. Allow to cool. 4. To make the fruit cup cream, whip the cream to soft peaks. Add the icing sugar and fruit cup, and whisk to medium peaks. Place the cream in a piping bag with a 0.8cm tip and set aside. 5. Finally, make the strawberry powder. Using a pestle and mortar, crush the dried strawberries. Add the icing sugar and orange zest. 6. To assemble, slice the sponge horizontally into three equal layers. Brush the bottom sponge with fruit cup. Mix the jam with the rhubarb and spread half on to the sponge, leaving a 2cm border. Pipe mounds of fruit cup cream around the edge, and sprinkle with some coriander seeds. Place the middle sponge layer on top and repeat. Top with the final layer and sprinkle it with strawberry powder. Heston’s tip: for an added seasonal touch, scatter 400g strawberries, quartered, between each sponge layer.
