You may be out of luck. Vacationing in Bali and ready to go home - maybe not. \nNo one, including tourists, are allowed to leave the Indonesian Islands of the Gods right now by air. \nIndonesian authorities shut four airports on Friday, including on the popular holiday destination island of Bali, due to a volcanic eruption, flag carrier Garuda Indonesia said on its official Twitter account. \nThe airport codes closed are DPS, LOP, JBB and BWX. \nMount Raung in East Java has been erupting for nearly a week. The Indonesian transport ministry official JA Barata said the re-opening of the airports would be based on Mount Raung's activity.
