They asked for recommendations to experience traditional Cyprus. \nThey then made a Google.co.uk search using the term ‘Cyprus tailor-made holiday’ The winner : Hannah Reeve, Thomson \nScore: 94% \n  ﻿﻿﻿I was greeted instantly in a light and spacious store by a welcoming agent. While taking notes, she said she’d visited Ayia Napa, and explained the weather we could expect. She showed me some cultural and vineyard tours from Thomson, and offered to print them if we booked, to use as inspiration when driving ourselves. She recommended Thomson’s Small & Friendly range, giving me a Greece & Cyprus brochure. I found Protaras’s Anais Bay Hotel and Apartments, and I was shown lots of photos online. The agent was keen to ensure it was a good choice for us, highlighting customer reviews and checking the hotel’s website to ensure parking was available. I was given three flight options, settling on a B&B package for £1,278. She was enthusiastic and friendly, I felt she genuinely wanted to find me a holiday that fitted my requirements and she followed up with a personal email four days later. Meet the consultant \nHannah Reeve, Travel advisor, Thomson \nH﻿ow long in travel? \n﻿I’ve been at Thomson for a year now - before that I worked at Waitrose and for the council. I always wanted to work in travel because I love hearing about people’s holidays. \n﻿How often do customer enquiries have a responsible angle? \nIt depends on the customer - when it’s a family, it’s not necessarily at the forefront because they’re more concerned about the children having a good time, but people often express an interest in local culture. \n﻿What’s your take on it? \nWhen I travel I like to explore the local area. I did a jeep safari in the Dominican Republic that took us into towns to meet people and we made sure to buy hand-made souvenirs from locals. \n﻿Have you been to Cyprus before? \n﻿I have, but to Nissi Beach in Ayia Napa - it was a different holiday to the one the Mystery Shopper wanted! \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T11:06:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
