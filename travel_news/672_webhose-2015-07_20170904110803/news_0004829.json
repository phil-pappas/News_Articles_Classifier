So many of us put our hearts and souls into this.”\nScores of customers voiced their support on the Udder Facebook page, including a woman who said she was “never, ever buying from Cotton On again”.\nUdder designer Fliss Dodd believes Cotton On’s cushion borrowed heavily from her handmade doll.

Source: Supplied\nMelbourne-based designer Andrea Goulding said she was shocked when a customer said a top strikingly similar to her Wild Child kids’ T-shirt was being sold at Target.\nThough she initially shied away from contacting the retailer after the item appeared in stores last summer, Ms Goulding said mounting complaints by fellow designers — and a recent compensation payment — had steeled her for a fight.\n“If it happens again, I’ll probably take it further,” she said.\n“It’s just really frustrating. I know fashion is about copying, but it doesn’t seem to be right that they are going after small designers. I practically just operate out of my kitchen.”\nThe mumpreneur said Instagram and Pinterest had become a double-edged sword, serving as a powerful marketing tool for her KaPow Kids brand, while also providing big retailers with a ready source of inspiration.\nKaPow Kids designer Andrea Goulding launched her Wild Child T-shirt in early summer 2014-15.

Source: Supplied\nTarget Australia paid another Melbourne design business, Peaches and Keen, $5000 to settle claims it was selling items that closely resembled their designs, as revealed by Smart Company last month.\nThe news prompted a slew of claims by other niche operators against the big retailers, with Kmart denying it copied a wooden puppy toy sold by Tiger Tribe, and Country Road declining to comment on allegations it copied a Melbourne lighting designer’s wares.\nSuch Great Heights designers Ryan O’Connor and Jo Fahy, who this year relocated to New York, spoke out on Instagram about alleged copying of their signature design, the Wonder Tent.\n“We are the latest target (ahem) of the all too common practice of multinational chain stores copying the designs of small Australian labels,” they wrote.\n“It’s lazy, lazy work, and tremendously unethical. There have been various Wonder Tent imitators along the way, but this is the closest copy yet, albeit a poorly executed one ... We’ve worked tirelessly since 2011 to create our beautiful Wonder Tent design using premium hard woods, organic fabrics, and commissioning unique textile designs from independent artists around the world (and) the manufacturers we work with are all family owned businesses.”\nNew York-based Australian design team Ryan O’Connor and Jo Fahy, of boutique brand Such Great Heights, are unimpressed by what they see as blatant, “poorly executed” copying of their signature children’s product, the Wonder Tent (pictured), by major retailers.

We have had way worse copying from other small Australian businesses, so exact that we even struggled to tell them apart from ours.”\nThe designer, who is based near Byron Bay on NSW’s north coast, resigned herself to the fact that trends-based outlets would always “spot the latest trend and replicate it”.\nFromage La Rue’s marquee lights are a top seller for kids’ bedrooms, retailing for $159.

Source: Supplied\nTarget Australia spokeswoman Kristene Reynolds said the dispute with Peaches and Keen was settled in February to the satisfaction of both parties, with the retailer agreeing not to reprint the design under an agreement allowing it to sell out existing stock.\n“Target takes its responsibilities in respect of intellectual property issues very seriously,” Ms Reynolds said.\n“Our designers and graphic artists look at trends from a range of sources and take great pride in their work.”\nShe said the company was yet to hear from KaPow Kids, or any of the other small designers to have recently spoken out.\n“We really strongly encourage these designers to contact us directly with their concerns,” she said.\nNews.com.au has sought comment from Kmart, Typo and Cotton On.\ndana.mccauley@news.com.au\nOriginally published as Target’s big rip-off of the little guy", "external_links": ["http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/15/1227443/084670-0bf43854-2aa3-11e5-a918-69a980c5d30d.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/15/1227443/084615-2ef4ee3e-2aad-11e5-a918-69a980c5d30d.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/15/1227443/083889-589c3264-2aa4-11e5-a918-69a980c5d30d.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/15/1227443/083809-1e42db42-2aa7-11e5-a918-69a980c5d30d.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/15/1227443/084698-11694572-2aa3-11e5-a918-69a980c5d30d.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/15/1227443/084780-6090717e-2aa4-11e5-a918-69a980c5d30d.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/15/1227443/083835-eaa63d24-2aa6-11e5-a918-69a980c5d30d.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/15/1227443/083726-1bea2e80-2aad-11e5-a918-69a980c5d30d.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/target-cotton-on-and-kmart-accused-of-copying-small-designers/story-fnkgdftz-1227443083943"], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T10:24:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
