It is now launching a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo to develop further. Bangkok, Thailand, July 07, 2015 --( PR.com )-- Very Local Trip is an innovative collaborative platform putting in relation travellers- keen to travel in a different way - with locals all over the world!More and more travellers are looking for authenticity during their holidays or stays in countries that they might be visiting for the first time. The best way to discover a country is to spend time with local people by going off the beaten track instead of doing it the traditional, touristic way.Until now Very Local Trip was financing itself but the startup now needs more funds to develop its IT services as well as its marketing and communication ones. That’s why they decided to launch a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo (http://igg.me/at/verylocaltrip/x/110887).As mentioned above, their investment priorities are:● IT development:It has been a year since the first launch of the website, and a month since it has been modified to a more functional and practical version. Verylocaltrip.com still remains a very basic website and would benefit from some advanced improvements. The young company thus needs to hire an IT expert to improve it and also needs this IT expert to develop a smartphone application in order to be able to reach the customer better and respond to his needs. This is currently the main need which requires an amount of 12000 USD.● Communication and marketing:Not a single penny has been invested in communication yet. But to gain visibility and make Very Local Trip known worldwide, it is time to start. The focus will be on digital communication but for that, some funds are needed. They will need communication and marketing to raise awareness about their concept to travellers as well as locals at a cost of 1900 USD.If more money than expected is raised, here is how it’s going to be spent:● Attracting key talents to work with them● Participating in travel and tourism exhibitions related to collaborative tourism and economy in order to increase visibility (example: TBEX Trade Fair in Bangkok for 700 $)● Organizing meetings with the whole local community in order to strengthen it● Organizing local events about collaborative tourism● Renting a more decent working space● Paying furniture and office expenses Contact Information", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T23:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T03:28:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
