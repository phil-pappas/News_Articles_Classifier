Bali offers the ultimate, relaxing tropical getaway without breaking the bank.\" \n\"My husband and I stay at a different resort each time around Tuban. We like the area because it's quiet, yet still close to the main heart of Kuta and within walking distance of the beach. It's also perfect for families. The Bali Dynasty Resort is perhaps one of the best picks for kids.\" \n\"When it comes to things to do, I personally think there's nothing better than lying on the beach and enjoying massages, but first time visitors shouldn't miss Waterbom Park, the sacred Ubud Monkey Forest or sunset drinks in Uluwatu.\" \n\"I also love exploring the markets around Sanur. The energy is just electric - it's the kind of place where locals pick up goods to sell in their own stores and I always come away with trinkets for home.\" \n\"At the end of the day, my annual Bali holiday just gives me a chance to relax. In fact, the hardest decision I have to make is where to eat! There are so many wonderful restaurants.\" \nDrop in to see Patricia at Flight Centre Mt Pleasant, and she'll be more than happy to share her extensive knowledge and experience to create your perfect Bali beach break or a holiday to any other destination that takes your fancy. \nCall Flight Centre on 1300 772 571 holiday", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T03:46:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
