Unless we make sure we balance our use of the area, through adaptive management strategies, and managing the impacts and also developing a vision for sustainable resource use, we will lose the things we value in the seascape.”\nMr Wainiqolo stressed the importance of the workshop and stated that this is the first step to moving forward with discussions and strategies to protect our marine life.\nThe one and half day workshop organized by Wildlife Conservation Fiji is attended by stakeholders from the tourism, government, community and fishing sectors.\nRelated Posts ‘Earn While you Learn’ Programme – India Utah lost $33 million in tourism due to shutdown Chelsea Football Club Hosts Leaders Sport Summit 2013, the world’s most Prestigious Sport Business Summit Fijian government to generate job opportunities in tourism and construction sector Earthquake of magnitude 6.1 rattles Raoul Island in New Zealand", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:00:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
