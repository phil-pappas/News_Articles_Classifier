Those of us in coach are smashed into seats designed for people without hip bones, trying to ignore the fact that the woman beside us has already removed her shoes and socks and that the guy behind us seems to be practicing his punch combinations against our headrest. That’s why Air Malta’s newest amenity sounds so glorious – at least in theory. \nThe flagship airline of Malta (and why wouldn’t the world’s 9th smallest country have its own carrier?) has started offering free massages to passengers in its Economy class. Lucky fliers on the airline’s London/Gatwick to Malta flights are getting complimentary rubdowns – head, hand, foot and neck massages – from two professional massage therapists. As part of the airline’s Sky Spa program, passengers are also given samples of beauty products and €20 ($22) coupons for the Myoka Spas, which are located in four swanky hotels in Malta. \nIn a statement, Air Malta said \nThis experience is just the beginning and part of a series of similar projects that Air Malta will be launching in the near future aimed at enhancing customers experience and showing that the airline ‘cares more.’ Photo: Air Malta/Facebook \nAir Malta published a photo set of its very first Sky Spa treatments on Facebook , and that still didn’t answer most of our logistical questions about how this is going to work. If the therapists want to work on the person with the aisle seat, they’ll have to stand in the middle of the plane trying to awkwardly touch someone’s temples without bashing them with a forearm, Jose Canseco-style. But to reach the window seat, either the masseuse has to basically rub their back pockets in someone’s face while they reach over the seatback or that passenger is going to have to lay on everyone else’s lap to reach the aisle. How does this work, Air Malta? How?! \nDespite our own concerns about its execution, the airline plans to bring the Sky Spa to additional flights in the future. Air Malta recently boasted that it was ranked the 6th Best Regional Airline in Europe in this year’s Skytrax World Airline Awards. But if this whole Sky Spa thing does work out, then next year we just know it’ll be Europe’s 5th Best Regional Airline. You’ve been warned, CSA Czech Airlines.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T09:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T10:01:12.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
