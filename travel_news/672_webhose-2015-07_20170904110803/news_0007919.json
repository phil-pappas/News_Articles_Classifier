EVA Air will take delivery of the first freighter in October 2017 and is set to have all five in operation by September 2019. \nThe official signing ceremony took place with Boeing and GE Aviation officials in Taipei on 21st July 2015. The Taiwanese airline’s Chairman, Kuo-Wei Chang witnessed the signing by Austin Cheng, President of EVA Air; Joh Wojick, Boeing Commercial Airplanes Senior Vice President of Global Sales and Marketing; and Chaker Chahrour, GE Aviation Vice President and General Manager in charge of Global Sales and Marketing. \nEVA’s new Boeing 777 freighters will carry as much as a 102-ton payload. The aircraft will be powered by the same GE90-115B engines the carrier uses for its Boeing 777-300ERs. By selecting the same engines, EVA Air will enhance maintenance efficiency and reduce costs. The carrier will also benefit from the Boeing 777 family’s fuel efficiency and environmental advantages. In comparison with the Boeing 747-400 freighters currently operating now, Boeing 777s can reduce fuel consumption by 25%. \n“Airfreight is an important link in global trade,” comments EVA Air Chairman, Kuo-Wei Chang. “We are investing in the most advanced aircraft and committing ourselves to continuing to ensure efficient, reliable service. Quality service and flight safety are our top priorities at EVA and we apply the same high standards to cargo services. We are determined to make EVA the world’s best airline for both passengers and cargo services.” \n“We are pleased to be the first airline in Taiwan to introduce Boeing 777 freighters,” adds EVA Air President, Austin Cheng. “EVA participated in the development of Boeing 777-300ER and became a launch customer. We now fly 21 Boeing 777-300ERs and have 13 more on order. We have made the right choice as our experience with this aircraft’s advanced technology and excellent performance indicates what we can expect from the Boeing 777 freighters. These freighters will be the backbone of our air cargo service for the next decade.” \n“As EVA Air continues to modernise their world-class freighter fleet, we are honoured that they have selected the 777 freighter to maintain their position as one of the largest cargo airlines,” says Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO, Ray Conner. “This order further validates the strength of the long-term partnership between EVA Air and Boeing over the last several decades.” \nChaker Chahrour, Vice President and General Manager of Global Sales & Marketing at GE Aviation, went on to add: “We are so pleased to see EVA expand its fleet with GE90-115B-powered Boeing 777 freighters. We have delivered more than 2,000 GE90 engines to 70 operators around the world. This aircraft/engine combination has proved its performance and reliability as the most successful long-range wide-body in service today.” \nEVA Air currently operates a fleet of 71 aircraft, including eight 747-400 and six MD-11 freighters. As the new Boeing 777 freighters are delivered, they will be put to work on the airline’s trans-Pacific and Asian routes, gradually replacing its existing freighter fleet. EVA’s air cargo network covers 64 cities around the globe, including seven destinations served by 44 freighter flights per week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T14:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T22:02:02.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
