The role consolidates Corporate Communication & PR activities for 80 hotels in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Poland and South-Eastern Europe and is directly subordinated to the Area Vice President. Martin will steer corporate reputation campaigns in Central Europe and coach hotels in using PR efforts to drive brand awareness and revenue. He will also build and strengthen relationships with international bloggers and influencers. \n\n\nMartin entered the hotel industry in 2002 by completing an apprenticeship in his hometown Stralsund in Northern Germany, followed by hotel specialist trainee position in a 5-star luxury hotel at Tegernsee, Munich. After working as Management Assistant, Sales Manager In-house and Project Manager, Martin joined the Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group in 2009. He started as Marketing & PR Manager at Radisson Blu Hotel, Hamburg where he was responsible for marketing the newly renovated first class hotel. Just two years later, in 2011, he took over the position of Executive Assistant to the Central Europe Area Vice President. His role also involved driving the group’s Responsible Business activities in the area. He became a certified Responsible Business Trainer and drove the group’s award-winning ‘Think Planet’ energy saving initiative in Central Europe. \n\n\nIn 2014, Martin took over Marketing for Park Inn by Radisson, supporting the strategic development of the company’s renewed midscale brand across all Central European countries. \n\n\nFor Timm Eckl, Area Vice President Central Europe, Martin’s fast success track is not surprising: “Martin is well-versed in our industry, well-integrated into our company’s strategy and experienced with our brands and hotels. He is a results-driven multitasker, with a genuine Yes I Can!-spirit, totally devoting himself with immense enthusiasm to his job. With his cordiality and charm, Martin has the ability to positively influence colleagues, guests and other stakeholders.” \n\n\nIn his private life, Martin likes to travel – mostly on sea – and is a highly active leader. As communication and interacting with others simply runs in his blood he regularly blogs about his travel adventures. \n\n\nAfter six years of diverse experience within the group, Martin is delighted to take on his new challenge in Communications & PR: “I am very much looking forward to this new task, to providing strategic communication and PR support to our hotels and powerfully telling our stories to the world. Thanks to the dynamic and multi-dimensional 4D strategy of Rezidor, my new role enables me and my team to make a great impact in the media and the communities we operate in.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T16:31:04.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
