From July 11 through Sept. 13, daily trains numbered 500, 501, 507, 508, 509 and 516 will arrive at their final destinations 10 minutes sooner. The trip will now be a 3 hours, 40 minute trip. Two of the trains will have different departure times, with the 501 leaving at 7:25 a.m. and the 507 leaving at 2:10 p.m. \nOver a year ago, the Washington State Department of Transportation added extra time to some routes to accommodate ongoing rail improvement construction projects, but officials limited those interruptions this summer.
