The Santa Cruz municipality plans to invest ₡94 million (some $173,000) in repairs to the road that connects the two beaches in the coming months.\nLocal business representatives and leaders of the Tamarindo Commerce and Tourism Chamber ( CCTT ) met last week with officials from the municipality and the Public Works and Transport Ministry to propose solutions for the route.\nThe gravel road currently has a large number of potholes and it becomes very difficult to drive during the rainy season, from May to November. Business owners say it is seriously affecting tourist visitation.\nMunicipal staff last week conducted a vehicle count on the road which will be part of the basic information sent to private companies interested bidding on the contract for paving the road. The project’s timetable has yet to be finalized, the municipality reported.\nCCTT President Hernán Imhoff said works will bring benefits to businesses that currently provide most of the jobs in the region, but it also will improve conditions for visitors and residents.\n“The agreement to move forward with this project is a good sign for the tourism sector here which constitutes the backbone of this area’s economy,” Imhoff said.", "external_links": ["http://playatamarindo.org/asociaciones-associations/acctt/"], "published": "2015-07-18T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T23:04:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
