The crash sort of represented the European peace we all thought it was living together nice harmony but for this to happen in Ukraine which is not that far away, I think that was weird and we all remembered now. That is why people will always remember it, for the grief of those who died but also for the historic moment when sh*t got real.”\nFriend Rik Frieling said Holland was so small everyone knew someone who knew someone aboard that plane and that is why the pain one year on was still so raw.\n“It’s weird, its like a seven degrees thing but then a whole lot smaller because we are a small country,” he said.\nRemembering those lost ... Next of kin of MH17 victims prepare a dance in the garden. Picture: Ella Pellegrini Source: Supplied\nRemembering those gone\nThe Netherlands went into a collective national day of mourning again on the one-year anniversary of the tragedy that killed almost 200 of their citizens.\nThere were several memorials about the country including at Schipol Airport in Amsterdam where the doomed flight left to streets that lost whole families and sports clubs that lost its players.\nBut the central point of grief was at the town of Nieuwegein, 10km from Utrecht and its large NBC conference centre where more than 1500 families and friends of those killed in the crash including 120 people from Malaysia and Vietnam and dignitaries from governments directly affected gathered to pay their respects.\nShortly after midday local time, hundreds of families and close friends of those passengers and crew killed on MH17 a year ago began filing into the convention centre.\nMany of them carried single long stemmed Sun Flowers, which has very much become the symbol of the tragedy.\nThey hugged, some cried as they were ushered in to be greeted by the wall of teddies which organisers said was in honour of all killed but particularly the 80 young victims and children of the tragedy.\nA bus load of Malaysians, many wearing traditional shirts and the songkok or kopiah caps, were also ushered in as a block.\nThe Australian embassy in the Netherlands declined to confirm that Australia was being represented at the memorial by the ambassador but most ambassador from nations affected were present.\nGone ...

Picture: AP/Patrick Post Source: AP\nThe satellite town of Nieuwegein has no direct connection to the victims of the tragedy but was selected by the Dutch government as the central point for families of the victims since it was not on the train line and thus the aggrieved would not have to travel there by train but instead would have to drive.\nThis was where the families were brought to be briefed on what happened to flight MH17 on the Monday after the Thursday downing of the commercial airliner and again some months later when a preliminary investigation had been conducted.

Picture: AP/Dmitry Lovetsky Source: AP\nMinistry of Security and Justice spokesman and event organiser Willy Steenbakkers said it was the fifth MH17 event to be held at the venue.\n“We chose an area that was quiet and outside the big town with no train line because we didn’t want next of kin coming here on public transport when they are grieving,” Mr Steenbakkers said.\nHe said there was still a lot of talk about the tragedy not just in Nieuwegein but across Netherlands.\n“It’s sort of a revival, perhaps not the right word, but a revival of what happened a year ago,” he said.\n“When it happened it was a big shock. The day of national mourning after the tragedy where thousands lined the road that was the feeling of the Dutch people. In feeling and emotional awareness … the Dutch people were more or less one. One way or another everybody knows someone in the airplane, not everybody but a large part of the population. Youngsters who died were in a football club for example, so then you have 200 or 300 people in the football club who know people inside in the plane. There were a lot of youngsters there in the plane.”\nUkrainian villagers mark MH17 anniversary\nAbout 200 Ukrainian villagers have gathered on a field that was cleared of the scattered charred remains and personal belongings of 298 people killed aboard Flight MH17 one year ago.\nThe locals — nearly all of them bussed in by pro-Russian separatists who control parts of eastern Ukraine — waved flags of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic and carried banners accusing Kiev of killing innocent people in the ongoing battle with the rebel forces.\n“Kiev — hold your fire,” read one banner.\n“You were killed. But we are still being killed,” said another. Solemn procession ...

Picture: AP /Mstyslav Chernov Source: AP\nLocal representatives said relatives of the victims of the Malaysia Airlines crash — most of the Dutch — had made private visits to the rebel-controlled crash site in the past few weeks.\nMost of those who gathered on the fields that were recently covered with parts of the Boeing 777 and the wallets and slippers of the victims rejected the idea that rebel commanders were to blame for the downing of the jet.\nThey paid respect to the memories of those who died by releasing white balloons handed to them by rebel leaders, and waving the orange and black flags of the militia command.\n“We are ready to provide all the help necessary to those who can finally prove the criminal Ukrainian regime’s responsibility for this tragedy,” Donetsk separatist leader Alexander Zakharchenko told the crowd.\nHe later unveiled a granite stone monument dedicated to the “298 innocent victims of (Ukraine’s) civil war”.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.couriermail.com.au/subscribe/news/1/index.html?sourceCode=CMWEB_WRE170_a&mode=premium&dest=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/world/full-transcript-russian-backed-rebels-ransack-the-wreckage-of-mh17-in-shocking-17-minute-video/story-fntzq3qq-1227444629703&memtype=anonymous", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/the-netherlands-remembers-the-victims-of-mh17/story-fnizu68q-1227446211446?sv=b10563c4f3d47898d48100d73e3bf635&title=Victims+families+united+in+grief", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/the-netherlands-remembers-the-victims-of-mh17/story-fnizu68q-1227446211446?sv=b10563c4f3d47898d48100d73e3bf635&h=Victims+families+united+in+grief", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/the-netherlands-remembers-the-victims-of-mh17/story-fnizu68q-1227446211446?sv=b10563c4f3d47898d48100d73e3bf635&title=Victims+families+united+in+grief", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Victims+families+united+in+grief&c=AS+the+Netherlands+remembers+the+MH17+victims+one+year+on+Frauke+Nauta+will+never+forget+that+fateful+day.+A+day+she+believed+her+country+was+about+to+go+to+war.&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/the-netherlands-remembers-the-victims-of-mh17/story-fnizu68q-1227446211446?sv=b10563c4f3d47898d48100d73e3bf635", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/the-netherlands-remembers-the-victims-of-mh17/story-fnizu68q-1227446211446?sv=b10563c4f3d47898d48100d73e3bf635", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/the-netherlands-remembers-the-victims-of-mh17/story-fnizu68q-1227446211446?sv=b10563c4f3d47898d48100d73e3bf635"], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T21:54:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
