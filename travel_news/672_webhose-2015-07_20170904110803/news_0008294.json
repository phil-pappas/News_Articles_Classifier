Another reason I love being Associate Tourism Minister. Posted by Paula Bennett on Thursday, 23 July 2015 \nThey call it \"Skyscreamer\" for a reason. \nThat's what Government minister Paula Bennett found out the hard way when she climbed aboard the vertical bungee ride. \nA video posted to Bennett's Facebook page shows her and fellow National Party MP Mark Mitchell on the ride, which is on the corner of Victoria Street and Albert Street in central Auckland. \nPaula Bennett, centre, and Mark Mitchell, right, get hysterical. \nSkyscreamer puts three people into an egg-shaped cage and launches them skywards with bungee cords. \nBennett, who among her other portfolios is Associate Minister for Tourism, reacts to the ride's 200kmh speeds with a hysterical mix of screaming, laughter and swearing. \nBut it appears she enjoyed the experience. \n\"Checking out a tourism business in central Auckland with Mark Mitchell. Another reason I love being Associate Tourism Minister,\" the video's caption reads. \nBridgitte Griffin, one of the ride's owners, said Bennett's response was pretty standard among the ride's patrons. \n\"That's where it gets its name, Skyscreamer,\" she said. \nShe said the ride gets plenty of celebrities, but having Bennett and the others aboard was \"quite exciting\". \nShe expected the experience would have put Bennett in a good mood. \n\"That adrenaline rush really keeps you happy for the rest of the day.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T01:50:06.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
