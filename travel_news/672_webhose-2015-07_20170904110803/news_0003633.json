Move to Central America By Chuck Bolotin | 07/16/15 - 10:18 AM EDT Reprint \nNEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- A sizeable number of U.S. citizens have moved to Central America. \nEstimates from the United Nations Population Division in mid-2013 showed 13,000 Americans living in Costa Rica, 12,000 in Panama, 4,000 in Nicaragua and 3,000 in Belize. \nCosta Rica has long been attractive destination for U.S. retirees, but the latter three countries have become increasingly popular in recent years and often turn up on lists of the best places to retire abroad, such as this one from AARP. \nWhy would someone pull up stakes to live in a foreign country with a different language and culture? \nA recently published study, \" Expats: Expectations & Reality ,\" by Best Places In The World to Retire , provides some answers. \nIt summarizes the responses of 389 expatriates living in Central America, the vast majority of whom live in Panama, Belize and Nicaragua. The survey was hosted on SurveyGizmo and was conducted between April 17 and April 27. Among respondents, 73.5% said their home country was the U.S., while 12.9% came from Canada, 4.6% from the U.K., 3.9% from elsewhere in Europe and the remainder from other countries. \nA whopping 82% of respondents said they moved in order to lead \"a simpler, less stressful life,\" while 55.8% were seeking \"a less materialistic or more meaningful life\" and 42.4% were seeking \"a more romantic, exotic, or adventurous life.\" \nHere are some more reasons why people had moved, and what they experienced afterward. \nAmong respondents, 86.6% said they thought they could lower their cost of living by moving. They also said they would enjoy a better quality of life as a result. Here's why: They would have less stress to pay bills. If they were retired, their retirement income would go much further, allowing them to travel and engage in other life-enriching activities they couldn't afford otherwise. They would have less stress because they would no longer have to do many of the things they didn't want to do in order to make more money. Now they wouldn't need as much money. They could avoid or eliminate, for example, driving in rush hour traffic to go to a job or spending lots of hours working. The ability to hire household help (gardeners, handymen, housekeepers) very inexpensively would mean an easier life with more free time. Not having to work at all or working less would allow them to have more time to do the things they enjoyed, such as being with friends, reading books, taking up hobbies or simply taking naps. \nRichard Detrich, from the U.S., living in Panama: \"I got tired of the rat race of Southern California and we wanted to escape and retire early. I told my wife, there comes a time when you need to cash in your chips and walk out of the casino ... and we did!\" \nFemale, age 25-44, married, working full-time, from U.S., living in Nicaragua for less than 2 years: \"Better quality of life and time with your spouse and children, able to afford private schools, people to help with home chores, and other things unaffordable in the U.S. Had to work twice as hard there and be more stressed just to be in debt at the end of the month. Cost of living is so low here, we save money so much quicker.\" 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T17:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T17:19:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
