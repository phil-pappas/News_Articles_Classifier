Please go ahead, sir. Stephen Cootey (CFO, SVP): Thank you and good afternoon. Joining the call on behalf of the Company today are Steve Wynn, Matt Maddox, Kim Sinatra, myself, here in Las Vegas. Also on the phone are the operational management team from both our Las Vegas and Macau properties. Before we get started, I just wanted to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements under Safe Harbor federal securities law and those statements may or may not come true. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Mr. Wynn. Steve Wynn (Chairman, CEO): Good afternoon, everybody. You have seen our numbers. They are, I think, probably no surprise to anybody. Macau continues to be more of a question than a certainty as we head through 2015 and towards our opening on March 25 of Wynn Palace in 2016. Our construction and our staffing is on schedule. We have made some adjustments in the staffing until we have a clearer picture of the game total that will be allocated to us by the government. But in the meantime, we are finishing this building. I would mention, as I have in the past, that the design of this building and its creation over five years ago was done in anticipation of market conditions perhaps not as critical as they are today, but under the general assumption that the robust and unprecedented growth in the market would not be the kind of growth we would be experiencing in 2016 and that we would face competition for which we had great respect. Our fellow operators in Macau are intelligent, they are extremely well financed, and they're quick to learn and to accommodate the things that they see in other hotels and to accommodate changes necessitated by their own experience in that market. It is a very, very sharp place. The buildings that are built represent remarkable diversifications into non-gaming attractions, and, of course, that adds to the competitive nature of our situation. We designed the hotel, as I say, in anticipation of just such an environment, perhaps not quite as critical as the one we are facing, but we said we had to be clearly, clearly a superior choice competitively. We enjoy a segment of the market that we wanted to continue to enjoy, the upper premium, the VIP business, and the top end of the mass marketing. We enjoy that advantage today and we intended to increase that advantage by the opening of Wynn Palace. Such were the assumptions of its creation and I'm happy to say that that was the result of the construction and the development. Our staff, headed by Mr. Gamal Aziz and Ian Coughlan and Linda Chen in China, are doing an excellent job in preparing the place to make a good opening and make a good impression on our guests so that, hopefully, the Wynn Palace will be everybody's first choice when they go to Cotai. In Las Vegas, we are enjoying a comfortable business, I think is the right word for it. It's not an aggressive growth, by any means, but we are enjoying non-casino revenue that is acceptable. Our slot machine and table games are growing, with one exception. This should come as no surprise to professionals on this call, and that is that since we were the operator of choice for the international baccarat business, namely from China, that if anything interfered with that business, we would, of course, experience more of a penalty in that regard than our competitors since we had more of those kinds of people attending our hotel. 1 of 10", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T13:55:35.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
