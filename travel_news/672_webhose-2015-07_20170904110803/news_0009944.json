But the 2015 edition of the Fest, slated for Sept. 26, won't look anything like what fell apart on the Chicago River last Oct. 4, in front of tens of thousands of onlookers. As it did last year, Redmoon theater company, will orchestrate the 2015 Fire Festival. The budget for the this year's Fest is $1.2 million, half of the $2.4 million expended on last year's event, which, in addition to the embarrassingly unspectacular spectacle on the Chicago River, included a number of weeks of neighborhood events leading up to the Oct. 4 finale. This year's Fest is being underwritten by the City of Chicago, the Chicago Park District, Allstate, the Pritzker Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts. Redmoon Executive Artistic Director Jim Lasko in an interview today said the 2015 Great Chicago Fire Festival is being moved far from the Chicago River which runs through the city's downtown, to the more remote Northerly Island. Northerly Island juts out into Lake Michigan beyond Soldier Field, McCormick Place and the Museum Campus that encompasses the Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium and Adler Planetarium. Formerly a small airfield, the Island has been transformed into a nature preserve and outdoor concert venue. Though the new location will be somewhat less familiar — and less readily accessible — to tourists, undermining at least part of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel 's purpose for greenlighting the Festival in the first place, the new, land-based site will allow Redmoon more control over how the show unfolds and supposedly make for a more satisfying and popular event. \"Plenty of people visit the Museum Campus,\" Lasko noted, suggesting visitors also would have no trouble finding their way to Northerly Island for his Fire Fest. Lasko said the Fest finale at Northerly Island still will include the burning of a structure intended to call to mind the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. But there also will be a \"rebuilding\" segment after the building has burned. This segment will reflect the grit and resilience of Chicagoans who rebuilt the city after the Great Fire. Last year's festival was to have included such a segment. But because the structures floating on the Chicago River didn't catch fire and burn as they were supposed to, the rebuilding theme never played out in the 2014 version of the Fire Fest. Lasko said this year's Fest also will include massed choirs and drum corps and several stages with performers reflecting some of Chicago's diverse neighborhoods. Will the Great Chicago Fire Festival go on after 2015? Lasko indicated only the upcoming Fest is assured. The possibility of future editions no doubt will hinge on how the 2015 Fest fares, what kind of attendance it draws and the availability of funding. \nWant Chicago Media & Marketing news in your inbox?
