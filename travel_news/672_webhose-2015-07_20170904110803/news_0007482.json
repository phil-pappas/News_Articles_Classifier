The children and their teachers were returning to Germany from an exchange trip in Spain when the Barcelona-Düsseldorf flight was deliberately brought down by the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, on March 24.\nIn an emotional letter to the chief executive of Lufthansa, Germanwings' parent group, the families said CEO Carsten Spohr had not spoken to them personally, nor had he apologised for the crash, in which all 150 on board died.\n\"You were there for your customers, but not for us,\" the families wrote in the letter made public by their lawyer.\nThey said they wanted an apology for Lufthansa's doctors not paying close attention to Lubitz's prior period of depression and for Lufthansa not having the two-person cockpit rule before the crash.\n\"With more attention paid to these risks our children would perhaps still be alive,\" they said.\nMore pilot screening and keeping two people in the cockpit at all times were among recommendations issued by a European task force set up after the crash.\nA Lufthansa spokesman said Spohr had spoken to many family members and had fully accepted responsibility and apologised for the suffering of the families. Signed letters of condolence had also been sent out, he said.\nThe publication of the letter comes after the families' lawyers, Elmar Giemulla, rejected an offer of EUR€25,000 for the pain and suffering of the victims, saying a six-figure sum would be more appropriate.\nUnlike in the United States, German law does not provide for large payouts for emotional damages.\nRonald Schmid, a German professor of aviation law, said the German laws on emotional damages were among the worst in western Europe. \"The system is out of date and needs changing,\" he said.\nGermanwings said the payout for pain and suffering made up only a small part of the claims and that material damages, such as lost earnings, could result in high sums being paid.\nA spokesman for the airline said it was awaiting the calculation of such claims from lawyers.\nLufthansa has already paid EUR€50,000 in immediate financial assistance, and relatives can also each claim EUR€10,000 for their own suffering, on top of the EUR€25,000 emotional damages offered to the victims.\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T23:06:28.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
