He said the closure comes after a 40 per cent drop in the use of slot machines in the past decade.\nBustamante said the former 24-hour casino that opened in 1975 will likely be turned into a ballroom.\nPuerto Rico's Hotel & Tourism Association said it is the seventh casino to close in the past five years in Puerto Rico. Government officials have said the previous closures led to a $6 million drop in revenue.\nCritics in part blame the closures on an estimated 45,000 illegal gambling machines that operate across the island.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T17:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T23:06:55.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
