The trail runs from Georgia to Maine, and this is the time of year when many hikers attempting to complete it travel through New Hampshire.\nCrisman was injured on Wednesday while staying at a shelter on Smarts Mountain. Another hiker, Sara Rognstad of Jackson, Tennessee, was injured Wednesday in a fall near the summit of Mount Cube in Orford.\nBoth were taken to hospitals for an evaluation.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T14:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T01:48:58.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
