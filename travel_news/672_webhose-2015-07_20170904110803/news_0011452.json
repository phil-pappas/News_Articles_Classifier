Here are three you may like to check out.\nCrocosaurus Cove\nNever smile at a crocodile, they say. But I can’t help cracking a grin as 4.6m saltie William glides majestically beside us, just a few centimetres away from my face on the other side of our glass cage.\nHis beady eyes look straight into mine and I can see his sharp, triangular teeth and thick, scaly skin. I’m sure he’s wondering what I taste like.\nWhen a keeper dangles a piece of meat in front of him the hungry croc jumps up high out of the water, and I hear his jaw snap loudly as he takes his prize.\nCrocosaurus Cove is the only place in the country where you can have the experience of being lowered into a crocodile’s pen inside the “Cage of Death”, operated by an overhead monorail, and swim alongside it for around 15 minutes.\nWilliam, part of a breeding pair, is one of nearly 200 crocodiles at the attraction, all special in their own way. Wendell is the longest at 5.5m. Axel is the heaviest at 900kg. Chopper is missing his two front legs. But the biggest star is Burt, who starred in the blockbuster film Crocodile Dundee in the 1980s.\n●Crocosaurus Cove, Adults $35, children (4-15) $23. The Cage of Death costs $130 per person per cage or $90 per person for two people per cage.

Picture: Katrina Bridgeford Source: News Corp Australia\nMindil Beach Sunset Markets\nMy favourite thing to do in Darwin is wander around the vibrant Mindil Beach Sunset Markets, which are on every Thursday and Sunday night during the dry season.\nDarwin is a very multicultural city, and every type of cuisine imaginable is on offer, from Greek yiros to crepes and dishes from Hong Kong and Sri Lanka. There are also stalls selling native game foods, such as crocodile terrine, a Lucky Cow vegetarian stall and others selling baked potatoes, wood fired pizzas and garlic mushrooms.\nTake a blanket and eat on the grass, or head down to the sand to catch the famous sunset.\nYou can also check out the buskers, get a massage and shop for indigenous artwork, clothing, jewellery, fire staffs, crocodile tooth necklaces and cane toad purses.\n●Mindil Beach Sunset Markets, Thursday and Sunday nights from late April til late October, between Sky City Casino and the Botanic Gardens, mindil.com.au\nMindil Beach Sunset Market.

Picture: Aaron Burton Source: News Corp Australia\nIt was ten weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor, and Darwin Harbour was a strategic port, with 45 ships anchored at the time. It was only a matter of time before the enemy struck.\nAs the bombs dropped the Australian soldiers fought back valiantly, using old weapons and ammunition not suited to the tropical heat that kept misfiring, and managed to take down seven planes.\nBut they suffered massive casualties. Officially, 250 people died. Unofficially, the number is up to 2000.\nIt was the first of 64 attacks on the Top End over a 21 month period during World War II.\nBefore taking Garry Gallagher’s Bombing of Darwin Tour, I knew little about the incident, besides the dramatic finale of the movie Australia.\nBut the enthusiastic Gallagher, whose father fought in the war, brings to life the heroic deeds of individual soldiers and recounts fascinating stories from the period as he drives passengers to key sites, pointing out bullet holes in fences and showing us bits of shrapnel.\nIn the eight years he has been running the tours, Gallagher has met many of the descendants of the people he mentions who have booked on the tour, which also includes entry to Darwin Military Museum, where you can hear the stories of those who were living there at the time in interactive exhibits and see maps, historic photos and bomb fragments.\n●Bombing of Darwin Tour, hotel pick up, daily 8.30am-12.30pm; adults $90, children (5-15-years-old) $50, 0432 041 132, bombingofdarwintour.com.au\nFollow Angela Saurine on Twitter: @Angela_Saurine\nGo2 DARWIN\nGETTING THERE\nQantas, Virgin Australia and Jetstar fly to Darwin.\nSTAYING THERE\nThe new Elan Soho Suites has an outside lap pool, gym and Korean restaurant.
