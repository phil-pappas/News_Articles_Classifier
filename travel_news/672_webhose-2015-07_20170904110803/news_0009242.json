Still having flashbacks of being back in that lecture hall? If you thought you had a rough time, spare a thought for these unlucky students… Pardon My French For my GCSE French Oral exam we were told to arrive 15 minutes beforehand and wait outside. As I sat anxiously, I heard a commotion inside the exam room, followed by the teacher running out past me then running back with another couple of teachers. Seconds later the previous student was being dragged out along the floor, having fainted quite spectacularly and hitting her head. As I watched the poor girl being lugged away, I was promptly beckoned in and told to hurry because we were now behind time. The only French words I could think of at that point were certainly not appropriate for the exam. Violining for Attention In my Violin practical, the examiner became so engrossed in the music that he suddenly leapt out of his chair and started accompanying me on an imaginary violin. I was so confused and tried desperately not to lose it as he swooshed and swayed with his invisible instrument. Westerly Breeze I had a horrendous cold and cough but my mum had forced me to go to school because it was exam period. During my Geography exam I had a crazy coughing fit and accidentally let rip a machine-gun fart. The entire class was in fits of laughter while the flustered teacher tried to calm us all down. I was mortified. You Have 10 Mouses Left During my Maths exam I suddenly heard giggles a few rows in front and one girl let out a squeal. As the invigilator shouted at us all to be quiet, I noticed what had caused the commotion – a family of mice running between the desks. We were told to stop being silly and concentrate on the task in hand. However, every 20 minutes or so there would be another little yelp, followed by a collective titter as a furry creature scuttled directly over someone’s foot. Ring for Assistance One of the boys in my year had a very nervous disposition and, perhaps, as a result of the stress, he acquired a serious dose of piles. Unable to sit on the school’s hard wooden chairs, he was forced to sit on a child’s rubber ring throughout every exam. Every so often we would hear a squeak as he wriggled around, which would cause everyone to giggle. In one exam his ring acquired a puncture and every 20 minutes you could hear him blowing it back up again. Something Doesn’t Add Up As I nervously sat down to my Economics exam, I looked to the side and saw that my friend had packed his TV remote control rather than his calculator. He’s a pretty sturdy guy but I’ve never seen him so close to tears. Chat Nap Sitting down to my final IT paper, I was so tired I thought I would just rest my head on the desk for five minutes. Nearly two hours later I was woken by the invigilator, not because I wasn’t completing the paper but because I was disturbing the rest of the students. Apparently I had started talking in my sleep and even calling out for my mum. The nap worked wonders, though, because I still managed to hastily finish two thirds of the paper and scrape a C. • Find more tips for studying, working and gap years on The Axis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T00:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T19:39:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
