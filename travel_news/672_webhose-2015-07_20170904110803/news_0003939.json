With English as the national language and a U.S. dollar that’s worth two Belizean dollars, Belize is the obvious right choice for a vacation. \nWhere to Stay? \nHopkins Bay Resort \nHopkins Bay is a perfect retreat for families, though packages are available for special occasions such as weddings and honeymoons. With a total of 19 available beach houses, accommodations range from a one-bedroom loft with a minibar to a three-bedroom house with private baths, a full kitchen and a living space. \nIf you’re worried about the cost of booking this late in the summer, Hopkins Bay has quite a few great deals running through the summer. Stay for 3 nights in a 1 Bedroom Beach Loft for $194 per night for 3 nights and get the 4th night for only $20. This deal is particularly impressive as it’s part of an initiative to help local children by covering the cost of a full year’s worth of school expenses for one student with each booking. \nKa’ana Resort \nLocated in San Ignacio, Belize, the Ka’ana Resort offers visitors a perfect blend of luxury and authenticity with five options for accommodations, from the Balam Suites that offer a private terrace to a 2,500 square-foot private two-bedroom villa that comes with a pool, personal butler and housekeeper. \nGuests at Ka’ana are also never far from the rich history, culture and natural wonders of Belize. Some of the adventures the resort offers include Mayan cooking classes, trips to the Tikal or Xunantunich Maya ruins or a unique journey that starts with snorkeling and lounging on the beach during the day and ends with camping out in the middle of a jungle at night. \nIf you book now through December 17th, Ka’ana’s offering a special deal in which guests staying a minimum of four days will enjoy the fourth night for free. \nWhat to Do? \nThe list of things to do in Belize is far longer than most vacationers will be able to fit in a single trip, from exploring Maya ruins and hiking through the jungles to snorkeling along the barrier reef or spelunking. Your best bet is an itinerary that blends culture, history and nature to get the most from your time in Belize. \nIf you’re looking to save money, avoid the congestion of too many tourists and enjoy the calm waters of the Caribbean Sea, the summer is the best season to visit Belize .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T17:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T18:32:16.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
