Cruises are all-inclusive with no charges for drinks or speciality restaurants.\nThe first Crystal Exclusive Class ship is scheduled to enter service in late 2018.\nCrystal’s expansion begins later this year with the launch of a 672-passenger yacht complete with a range of water toys that includes jet skis, kayaks and even a two-man submarine.\nThe maiden voyage of Crystal Esprit will be a Christmas cruise in The Seychelles – and passengers will end their holiday by flying to New Year’s Eve celebrations at the Taj Hotel, Dubai.\nSpring 2017 sees the arrival of Crystal River Cruises aboard two purpose-built ships with all-suite accommodation.\nLater in 2017, Crystal will soar to new heights with the arrival of Crystal Luxury Air, offering extravagant round-the-world trips on a sumptuously-appointed Boeing 787 Dreamliner.\nThe planes are normally configured to carry up to 300 passengers – this one will be fitted with just 60 fully-reclining lie-flat seat-beds.\nCrystal, which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, was originally owned by a Japanese shipping company.\nIt was bought this year by financiers and resort operator Genting Hong Kong.\nPresident and CEO Edie Rodriguez has been promising developments ever since she was appointed in October 2013.\nWhen she revealed the company’s news on board Crystal Serenity this week, its scope and ambition went way beyond the expectations of the entire travel industry.\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DailyMirror", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror"], "published": "2015-07-25T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T10:28:02.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
