The line said these places were frequently sold out, and that it had decided to increase these numbers to meet the strong demand. \nIt added that in order to make sure the dogs “from either side of the pond feel equally at home”, lamp posts and fire hydrants were also being installed on the area of deck reserved for dog walking. \nAngus Struthers, Cunard Director, said: “Queen Mary 2 is an icon in the world of luxury ocean travel. A ship that turns heads everywhere she goes, she is the pride of the Cunard fleet and we are committed to ensuring her reputation grows ever stronger.” \n“These enhancements are just the beginning of an exciting revitalisation for Queen Mary 2, and we look forward to making more announcements about this …refit in the coming months,” Struthers added. \nThe newly announced additional accommodation will go on sale on July 15, 2015 for Queen Mary 2 Summer sailings from late June 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T12:32:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
