Unfortunately those who have paid by direct bank transfer may not be able to access redress in this way, which serves as a reminder not to pay for travel services in this way. People in this situation should still speak with their bank about what options they may have.”\nMeanwhiles, some customers have taken to the company’s Facebook page to complain, receiving some shocking responses, even allegedly telling one client “you’re a f***ing pain in the ass hard maintenance anways”.\nSky Air Services also appeared to hit back at another customer complaining about their actions.\nAnother Facebook response.
