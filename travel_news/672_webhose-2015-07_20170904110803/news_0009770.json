Also, high-quality video calls required sufficient bandwidth, special video conferencing rooms, and expensive technology. Therefore, only large enterprises could justify these costs by reducing their travel expenses for initial sales meetings and presentation to potential clients. The introduction of desktop video solutions and managed and hosted VCS have made VCS a viable technology for everyday meeting and offloaded the high installation hurdle. Currently, organizations are not limited to VCS investments just based on travel avoidance. Most companies are adopting VCS to make it available to all their employees, with an easy guest access model for customers and partners to enrich collaboration and enhance business outcomes. VCS allow employees to share information in a more interactive way with other employees elsewhere through the Internet. VCS also allow employees to share virtual whiteboards, desktops, presentations, and spreadsheets, thereby improving communication between geographically scattered teams. Also, enterprises can improve their communication through the usage of new technologies such as recording capabilities and polling.Technavio's analysts forecast the global VCS market to grow at a CAGR of 9.5% over the period 2014-2019.
