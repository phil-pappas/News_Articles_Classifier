This has allowed the company to double its monthly refuelling volume in the UAE since July this year, to 400 tons per month at present. \nCurrently the Gazpromneft-Aero aviation refuelling network includes seven airports in the most important tourist and business centres of the UAE. Refuelling in this country is carried out in accordance with an agreement signed between Gazpromneft-Aero and ENOC (the Emirates National Oil Company) in 2013 for aviation fuel supplies to its network. The agreement provides for guaranteed supplies of Russian customers of Gazpromneft-Aero at UAE airports, as well as ENOC customers at airports serviced by Gazpromneft-Aero in Russia and the CIS. \n\"We highly value our strategic partnership with ENOC, which has made it possible for Gazpromneft-Aero to offer Russian airlines the best terms for aviation fuel supply in the UAE. Expansion of our refuelling business abroad is one of our company's priorities. \nRecently we have had considerable success in this area, developing long-term relations with the largest Russian air carriers and cooperating with leaders in the area of aviation fuel supply throughout the world\", Gazpromneft-Aero General Director Vladimir Egorov said. \n\"Start of refuelling Russian national carrier Aeroflot in Dubai was an important step in developing our cooperation with JSC Gazpromneft-Aero,\" ENOC marketing Sr. Manager Farid Al Bastaki said. \n\"We can guarantee high level of quality services and on-time refuelling for Russian airlines in UAE and also we confirm our interest to reciprocally refuel UAE airlines in Russia through our strategic partner JSC Gazpromneft-Aero.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T22:30:50.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
