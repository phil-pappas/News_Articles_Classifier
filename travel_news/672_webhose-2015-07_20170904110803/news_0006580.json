The BBC said a post-mortem examination would take place later. \nJessica was one of 24 students who had been on a trip to the Club Correze adventure centre. The pontoon is believe to have overturned while she and a group of other children were jumping from it. \nReporting from outside the hospital in Limoges, BBC Paris correspondent Lucy Williamson said Jessica had been one of a number of children swimming in the lake after the end of the day’s scheduled activities. \nShe added that: “Local sources have said they were jumping off a pontoon, the pontoon overturned and it was then that Jessica was found to be missing. \n“One of the lifeguards did manage to revive her by the side of the lake and she was brought here and she survived until just a few hours before her parents arrived to see her.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T12:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T15:45:39.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
