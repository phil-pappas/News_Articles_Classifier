Aussie Wildlife\nSunshine Coast, Queensland\nIt was wildlife campaigner Steve Irwin’s dream – a place people could mingle with critters and have their photo taken with them. Priding itself on “animal encounters”, Australia Zoo, run by Irwin’s family, allows visitors to get close to koalas, wombats and various native animals plus tortoises, lemurs, rhinos and even tigers. While tiger encounters are restricted to those aged 15 and over, children aged six-14 are welcome to enjoy possum encounters.\naustraliazoo.com.au\n Dusky dolphin jumping high off the coast of Kaikoura, New Zealand.

Clad in wetsuits, children aged eight-14 can paddle among the dolphins, while kids aged three and over can watch the fun from the boat. At times, visitors can swim with pods of up to 100 dolphins.\nwww.dolphinencounter.co.nz\n Polar bears in Canada. Picture: iStock Source: Supplied\n3. Polar Bears\nCanada\nWildlife guide Carol Walton has been bringing tourists to see polar bears in Churchill, Canada, for 18 years.\n“Each trip we see between 25 and 45 polar bears, often up close and personal from the comfort of a tundra buggy,” she says.\nOctober to mid-November is the time to visit as the bears arrive to wait for ice to form on Hudson’s Bay to hunt seals. Churchill is one of the few towns where polar bears can be seen in the wild. On many tours, kids eight and over are welcome.\nchurchillwild.com\n4. Animal-mania\nSan Diego Zoo, US\nSan Diego Zoo is no ordinary zoo. Where else could you enjoy an early morning get-together with pandas? Or feed biscuits to giraffes?

Tortoises\nGalapagos Islands\nOff the coast of Ecuador, these islands are alive with creatures including giant Galapagos tortoises, which barely react when people walk up to them.\nTed Martens, of Natural Habitat Adventures, which does family trips with kids seven and over, says the Galapagos Islands are great for younger folks because the wildlife is so prolific, friendly and approachable.\nCarol Walton agrees: “The animals are totally tame and you have to literally almost step over them. Sea lions play with you when you’re snorkelling, marine iguanas just sit there and you can get close-ups of their faces. Galapagos penguins will also swim around you.”\nperegrineadventures.com nathab.com/family-adventures\n6. Chilled critters Antarctica\nCruising to Antarctica from South America? Many guides recommend trips that include stops at South Georgia Island and the Falklands. Former guide Heidi Dormody advises a cruise via both, saying this trip is suitable for children 10 and over. “There you will see several varieties of penguins, elephant seals, whales and albatross.” South Georgia Island has incredible wildlife, Carol Walton says. “There is a beach with 500,000 king penguins. There are elephant seals, fur seals, and albatrosses, in addition to king penguins, gentoo penguins and macaroni penguins.” She says Antarctica is otherworldly with seals, whales, penguins plus majestic snow-covered mountains and blue icebergs.\nzegrahm.com , carolwaltonexpeditions.com\n See a lion up close in Namibia.

Monkey magic\nBali\nBeware, there’s a forest near Ubud where monkeys steal visitors’ snacks and leap on their backpacks, but if you’re careful, they’ll soon have you in stitches at their naughty behaviour.\nSouth of Ubud, Monkey Forest is full of temples but the long-tailed macaques tend to dominate interest.\n“Do not carry any food,” local Wayan warns. “If they charge, stand your ground. Step back and they’ll jump on you.”\nOnce they know you’re monkey-canny, they’ll leave you alone, he says.\nmonkeyforestubud.com\nHOW TO CHOOSE\nBefore booking a wildlife holiday, researching the safety standards of your tour or camp and whether it caters for children is vital.\nTed Martens, from Natural Habitat Adventures, recommends choosing a tour operator that specialises in family trips.\n“If it’s not something that they advertise that they do, then chances are they haven't put the thought into all of the nuances that families require,” he says.\n“That specialised interpretation is key to keeping the kids entertained — and the parents sane!”", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/594269-049afd74-2619-11e5-b856-d650f72d3e25.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/594297-05e788e6-2619-11e5-b856-d650f72d3e25.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/594544-0782396c-2619-11e5-b856-d650f72d3e25.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/594598-08b61344-2619-11e5-b856-d650f72d3e25.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/594243-0a6acce8-2619-11e5-b856-d650f72d3e25.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/594165-0d0e3674-2619-11e5-b856-d650f72d3e25.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-17T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T06:20:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
