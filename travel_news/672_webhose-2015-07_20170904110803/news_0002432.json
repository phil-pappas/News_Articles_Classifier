Researchers have discovered that a customer’s choice of shopping bag influences purchasing. And while canvas or hessian bags are more likely to encourage shoppers to choose environmentally friendly organic products, they also make people feel more virtuous and so deserving of a sugary or fatty treat. In fact, a study showed that people who took their own reusable bag into supermarkets were 33 per cent more likely to pick up unhealthy snacks than those who used the shop provide film bags. “Grocery store shoppers who bring their own bags are more likely to purchase organic produce and other healthy food,” said study author Uma Karmarkar, assistant professor of business administration at Harvard’s Marketing Unit. “But those same shoppers often feel virtuous, because they are acting in an environmentally responsible way. “That feeling easily persuades them that, because they are being good to the environment, they should treat themselves to cookies or potato crisps or some other product with lots of fat, salt, or sugar.” Shoppers who bring their own bags tend to buy organic which could raised the annual grocery shop by hundreds of pounds The study also showed that canvas bags could also be adding to the cost of the weekly grocery shop. The study showed that they encourage people to buy organic food, which adds around £8 to a family of four’s grocery bill, totalling an extra £416 a year. The study is the first to demonstrate that bringing your own grocery bags causes significant changes in food purchasing behaviour. The authors collected loyalty cardholder data for 142,938 shopping trips at a major grocery chain in California between May 2005 and March 2007. California has banned plastic bags since 2014. They compared the same shoppers on trips for which they brought their own bags with trips for which they did not. Participants were also recruited online from a national pool and were randomly assigned one of two situations: bringing their own bags or not bringing their own bags. “In short, bringing your own bags changes the way you shop,\" said Bryan Bollinger of Duke University, who co-authored the research. \"Our findings thus have important implications for grocery store managers. In stores where reusable bags are popular, marketing organic or sustainably farmed foods as indulgences could increase the sales of those items.” The research was published in the Journal of Marketing.
