This makes it the most expensive home for sale on what has been dubbed \"Billionaire Mountain.\"\nThe 18,000-square-foot home has seven bedrooms, seven full and four half baths and floor-to-ceiling windows showcasing views of the Rockies. The home sits on six acres of some of the highest elevation private property on the mountain.\nPHOTOS: View a photo gallery of The Summit House\n\"No one can build above this lot, as that land belongs to [Bureau of Land Management] and National Forest Service,\" said Mark Haldeman, the property's listing agent .\nBut the home's location is not the only feature of that home making it unique in the city of Aspen. New laws in Pitkin County, where the home is located, mean that the a home of this size can no longer be built, Haldeman said.\nThe maximum square footage varies depending on where a home is being built in the county, but Haldeman said the largest home that could now be built on Red Mountain is 15,000-square-feet.\nAdvertisement The current - and only - owner is also responsible for designing the home. The planning for the home began in 2005 and it was finished in 2010, Haldeman said. The home has been on the market since October 2014.\nThe Summit House has two elevators at either side to help the occupants travel between the three floors - one of which includes an \"adult playroom,\" featuring a Las Vegas-style craps table and bar.\nThere were five different woods used in the construction of the home and inlaid marble and granite throughout.\nA plunge pool, over 4,000 square feet of deck space and 11 fireplaces - including one in each of the seven bedrooms - can all be found in the home.\nBut Haldeman said it's not the interior of the home that first draws the eye at this property.\n\"The first thing that strikes you are the views, as they are truly breathtaking,\" he said. \"The front door opens and it's dead-on views of Aspen Mountain.\"\nHaldeman said that to sell a home like this requires a different approach than selling a more typical property. He and his partner, Craig Morris, have advertised the home on an international level through television shows like CNBC's \"Secret Lives of the Super Rich.\"\nThe 18,000-square-foot Summit House has seven bedrooms, seven full and four half baths and floor-to-ceiling windows showcasing views of the Rockies. The home sits on six acres of some of the highest elevation private property in Aspen. (Mountain Home Photo) \"We've had presidential candidates here and I guess its safe to say plenty of high profile, high power individuals,\" Morris said on CNBC.\nAnd to even look at the home, potential buyers have to prove their status as high profile, or at least their bank-account status as such. Every potential buyer is prequalified to ensure they can afford the price tag, Haldeman said.\nSo far there have a couple dozen buyers to be prequalified, and two offers rejected to date.\nMatthew Leonard 303-954-1823, mleonard@denverpost.com @matt_lnrd\nThere were five different woods used in the construction of the home and inlaid marble and granite throughout.
