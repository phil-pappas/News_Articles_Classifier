These new departures together with our upgraded long haul fleet and extensive network mean we have an incredibly strong service offer to both the USA and Asia that we intend to further strengthen in the near future. We look forward to offering our customers new travel opportunities and giving them a warm welcome aboard both our new aircraft and aircraft with our new cabins,” says SAS President and CEO Rickard Gustafson, SAS.\nIn June, SAS announced plans to expand its long haul fleet.
