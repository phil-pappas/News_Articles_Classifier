From a Banana Bread Peanut Butter Sandwich paired with Tawny Port to La Quercia Smoked Prosciutto with Scottish ale, Paired stretches the boundaries of traditional pairing principles by blending ingredients together in new and unexpected ways for guests. Available at Sheraton properties worldwide, Paired is the latest of many initiatives underway for Sheraton 2020, an all-encompassing plan designed to solidify Sheraton as a leading global hotel brand of choice, everywhere. \n“Sheraton guests crave new and personalized experiences, and when they travel, they look to create these opportunities,” said Dave Marr, Global Brand Leader, Sheraton Hotels & Resorts. “By building on the equity we have in wine, we’re adding local craft beers and introducing fun and exciting food pairings, which will offer our guests enriching and memorable culinary moments in our hotels.” \nTravel is Better When Paired \nThe new menu uniquely pairs small plates and bar snacks with an unexpected recommendation from Sheraton Selects—a menu of premium wines rated 85 points or higher by Wine Spectator—and a craft beer, sourced specifically from choice local brewers. Wine selections are available in a 2 oz. taste, a 6 oz. glass, or by the bottle. Sheraton hotel associates will better understand the best-in-class vintages featured on the Sheraton Selects menu as they complete Treasury Wine Estates’ Wine Training & Education modules. \nThe Paired program, offered across Sheraton properties globally, is available daily during the lobby venue’s hours of operation. Example menu items include: \n• Seared Sesame Salmon with Asian slaw, paired with a Pinot Noir or a Pale Ale \n• Goat Cheese Brulee with Fig Jam and Cranberry Focaccia, paired with Merlot or Brown Ale \n• Marinated Roasted Olives with Grilled Lemon and Red Chili, paired with Shiraz or Bourbon Barrel-aged ale \n• Cantonese Style Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings, paired with Riesling or IPA \nThrough its expanded lobby bar menu, Sheraton enables guests to experience more of their destinations’ various cuisines by often featuring global cuisine with local influences, while also challenging them to expand their palates. As part of the program, participating Sheraton properties will bring Paired to life with engaging programming—ranging from educational demonstrations by local craft breweries or sommelier hosted courses where guests learn the art behind flavor pairing. \n“The Paired menu concept delights the palate and invites exploration,” said Achim Lenders, Vice President, Starwood Global Food and Beverage. “Knowing the right beverages can enhance any food, our team carefully handpicked premium wines and craft beers to complement each unique small plate and accentuate its rich flavors.” As part of the launch of Paired, key Sheraton properties around the world will also host Paired celebrations in the coming months to introduce guests to the new concept. \nContinuously Innovating the Sheraton Guest Experience \nPaired is part of Sheraton 2020, a comprehensive 10-point plan revealed in June 2015 designed to put Sheraton Hotels and Resorts firmly back into the global spotlight. A nod to the plan’s clear five year vision, Sheraton 2020 also includes a new $100 million Sheraton-focused marketing campaign; the launch of the new premier tier, Sheraton Grand; continuous innovation of the Sheraton guest experience; an unwavering commitment to service excellence; the implementation of revenue and profit-driving initiatives to benefit owners and developers; and a goal of opening more than 150 new Sheraton hotels worldwide by 2020.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T22:27:19.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
