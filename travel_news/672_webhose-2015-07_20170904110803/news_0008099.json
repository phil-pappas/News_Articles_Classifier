Saintgeogskirche (St. George's Church) , a late-gothic church on the Marktplatz. See the \"pretzel window\" donated by the Baker's Guild. Climb the Romanesque tower (which remains from an earlier church) for the views of Dinkelsbuhl. Spitalanlage (old hospital complex) now includes the historical museum, concert hall, and gallery of art. Stadtmühle , a large, military fortified mill that now houses the Museum of the 3rd Dimension, hands-on displays featuring fascinating three-dimensional effects. \nDinkelsbuhl also sponsors Sunday concerts in the Town Park from May-September, often with overseas youth bands. Live jazz can be heard at the Jazzkeller. \nThe former grain market, built in 1508 and originally used as a barn to store grains, is now the youth hostel.
