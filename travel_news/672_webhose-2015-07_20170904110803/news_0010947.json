You've been meaning to go on holiday for a while now, but the thought of flying seems to be holding you back. Thinking about what to do, and where to go is enough to give you a minor anxiety attack. Relax! Flying for the first time will not be as stressful as you've made it out to be. In order to ensure that everything runs smoothly, there are a few things that you need to do, and know, in order to survive your airport experience. \nThings to do Firstly, you should book your airline ticket. The best way in which to do this is to go online and compare flight prices and holiday specials. Once you've chosen the best flight for you, book it and get packing for your trip. Collect all of your documents, from your passport to your driver's license. Make sure that you pack these strategically in your carry-on bag or handbag so that you are able to access them quickly when you are asked to produce them. Pack your carry-on bag carefully. Security at the airport can be very fussy about what you bring onto the plane. Get a list of what is not allowed on a flight and pack accordingly. You should arrive early at the airport. Not only is it mandatory that you do so, but it is your first time, so you'll need all of the extra minutes that you can spare to familiarise yourself with everything and make your way around. Check-in at the check-in counter with your identification in hand. This is where your reservation will be checked, bags weighed and tagged, and where you will receive your boarding pass. Be sure to leave that counter with your boarding pass and identification. You will then go through security for a security check - again, ensure that you have your boarding pass and identification in hand. Be ready to take off your shoes and jacket, and go through a metal detector. Once you're done with this, collect your items and, once again, it is important not to forget to retrieve your boarding pass and identification if it has been requested and looked at by security. Check your boarding pass for your gate number and go to it immediately. Once you have arrived at the gate, you can take a seat and wait for the announcement that notifies you that it is time to board your flight. Once you're called, you may board the plane and find your seat. \nYou've made it through the busy and confusing airport that threatened to give you an anxiety attack. Once seated, say a little prayer, get ready for lift-off, and enjoy the journey! You will soon be arriving at your destination.
