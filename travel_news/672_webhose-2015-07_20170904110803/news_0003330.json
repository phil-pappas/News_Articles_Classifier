Jul 21, 2015, 8:09am EDT Share Lewis Lazare and Jeff Jeffrey Triangle Business Journal Home of the Day A new survey from FlightView suggests a lot of flyers don't like what United Airlines and… more It's news United Airlines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines probably don't want to hear. But according to a new survey of 2,300 travelers from FlightView , a provider of airline and airport data, travelers are increasingly wary of booking trips to their desired destination that involve connecting flights. It now appears a lot of flyers no longer want the aggravation – and most importantly the uncertainty – that comes with having to make flight connections, or to a lesser degree, even make an intermediate stop before continuing on to where they want to go. That's especially true at a time when airlines aren't hitting their marks in getting flights to arrive and depart on time. During the second quarter of 2015, North Carolina’s three largest airports saw a significant drop in the number of flights departing on time . Raleigh-Durham International Airport's on-time departure rate dropped by nearly 10 percent. In June, just seven out of 10 (72.4 percent) flights departed RDU on time, according to data collected by FlightView. And many passengers would be willing to pay more to avoid the hassle altogether. According to FlightView, a whopping 70 percent of travelers surveyed said they'd be willing to pay a higher fare for a nonstop flight. Of that 70 percent, more than two-thirds of respondents said they be willing to pay fares that are 10 to 15 percent higher, and another one-third of respondents said they would even pay another 16 percent more on top of that to get a nonstop flight. What's more, the FlightView data also shows more travelers now are willing to drive further – perhaps bypassing their local airports and the economic impact they stand to gain – to book nonstop flights from more distant airports. Nearly 60 percent of travelers surveyed said they be willing to drive father for access to nonstop flights. And of that group, more than 25 percent said they would be willing to drive at least two hours – a statistic that surely suggests airline trips involving connections are losing significant appeal. But though travelers appear fed up with connections, the fact is the dynamics of the airline business have changed dramatically in the past decade. The airline industry no longer is about the customers first and foremost. Bottom line, it's about what makes money for the airlines and airports. And as service to many mid-sized and smaller airports that aren't hubs has been drastically cut or eliminated altogether in recent years, the hub and spoke system has only become more ingrained in the airline industry. So, can fliers' demand for more nonstop flights? As the FlightView survey notes, if airlines do decide to add nonstop service between two cities, \"the decision comes down to whether or not the new market will be profitable and deliver revenues that were previously unavailable to the airlines or airport.\" \nWant Raleigh/Durham Travel news in your inbox?
