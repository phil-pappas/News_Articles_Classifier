This largely reflects costs associated with the company’s long-running plan to build a resort on the Greek island of Crete. \nThe luxury resorts division made a loss of £627,000 while the travel and leisure division made a profit of £112,000 – down from £149,000 in the prior year. Minoan attributed this to an increased depreciation and amortisation charge. \nGroup total transaction value rose by 18.6% to £28.7 million and revenue increased by 19% to £3 million. \nChristopher Egleton, Minoan chairman, said: “The Group has seen improved growth in the first half, with the travel division benefitting from the strength of the pound and the UK’s continuing economic recovery. \n“Trading remains strong with the business in robust shape to move forward over the rest of this year and management continue to examine earnings enhancing strategic acquisitions to further improve the travel and leisure division’s performance.” \nEgleton remain hopeful that the approval of the Itanos Gaia luxury resort project in Crete will be approved in the near future. In anticipation of this the company has appointed Nicholas Day as a director of its subsidiary Loyalward Ltd. \nThe travel and leisure division has grown over the years as a result of a number of purchases, mainly in Scotland, including Stewart Travel, John Semple Travel and King World Travel. Minoan also bought a stake in Miles Morgan’s travel business last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T13:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T13:24:36.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
