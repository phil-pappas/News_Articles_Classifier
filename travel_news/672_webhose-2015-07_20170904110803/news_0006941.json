Joining their fourth property, Inkaterra Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel, this prestigious collection of boutique hotels, showcases remarkable destinations worldwide that demonstrates commitment to sustainability, authenticity and excellence. \nInkaterra Hacienda Urabamba, nestled in-between Cusco and Machu Picchu, boasts architecture and interiors inspired by the Sacred Valley’s cultural history. Rooms offer spectacular views of the surrounding mountains and are all immersed in open space, spirituality and serenity at 9,515 ft., offering one of the finest climates in the Cusco region. A 16th Century Manor house carefully restored, Inkaterra La Casona (Cusco), exemplifies Peruvian architecture and ambience with colonial furniture and native textiles. The first boutique hotel in Cusco, Inkaterra La Casona reflects the encounter of cultures and traditions throughout centuries, playing host to guests such as Spanish Conquistador Don Diego de Almagro, one of the three leaders of the conquest of Peru, and ‘Liberartador’ Simon Bolivar. Nestled within the Tambopata National Reserve, Inkaterra Hacienda Concepción offers an authentic Amazonian experience, where guests have the chance to explore the diverse landscape of the reserve. Within close proximity of Lake Sandoval, adventurers can scale the water mirror inhabited by Howler monkeys, caimans and giant river otters. José Koechlin, founder and CEO of Inkaterra Hotels said; ‘We are delighted to have the majority of our Inkaterra properties as part of this prestigious collection and to be able to enhance the awareness of biodiversity conservation' With the addition of 14 new lodges, the Unique Lodges portfolio now brings 38 distinguished properties across six continents together, adding to the 24 charter members at its launch in January 2015.
