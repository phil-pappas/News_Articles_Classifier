The properties are Shangshanqi Villa Resort and Taoyuan Hot Spring International Hotel in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, and Bo'ao Holliyard Seaview Resort in Hainan Island. The signing of these agreements expands RCI's portfolio of resorts in China to more than 55 properties. \n\"This is an exciting opportunity for RCI to expand its exchange options in Chengdu and Hainan, both popular tourist destinations in China,\" said Gavin Cheong, business development director for North Asia, RCI Asia Pacific. \"Bo'ao is a popular tourist town in Hainan among the locals, while Chengdu is gaining more attention among overseas tourists for its cute giant pandas and historical landmarks. We are confident these three properties are excellent additions for RCI's high-quality exchange network, and will be well received by our members looking for a unique cultural experience.\" \nShangshanqi Villa Resort is located at the foot of Qingcheng Mountain, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Qingcheng Mountain has been an important Taoist site for centuries, as it is believed to be one of the birth places of Taoism, China's only indigenous religion. Besides the panoramic scenery the mountain offers, many popular attractions are easily accessible from the resort, such as the Jianfu Palace, Moon City Lake, ancient Taoist and Buddhist temples and other historical relics. The resort comprises 760 villas, and all units come with a living room and a full kitchen. It is an hour away from Shuangliu International Airport via high speed rail, and 2 hours away via shuttle bus. \nTaoyuan Hot Spring International Hotel is located 57km west of Chengdu Dayi Heming Taoist Cultural scenic site, near the entrance of Qingcheng Mountain. The hotel's architecture and decor are strongly influenced by Taoism, in honor of the religion's birth place. Its exterior resembles a traditional Taoist temple, with a yin yang bagua -- a design associated with Taoism -- prominently featured on the ceiling of the hotel lobby, and subtly integrated throughout the hotel premises. \nOpened in 2010, the hotel is one and a half hour's drive away from Shuangliu International Airport and has a total of 132 guestrooms. It is popular for its numerous indoor and outdoor hot spring pools, and its proximity to tourist attractions such as golf courses, ski fields and cultural sites. \nBo'ao Holliyard Seaview Resort is located in the tourism area of Qionghai, east of Hainan Island and 90 kilometers from Haikou Airport. The town is famous for the Bo'ao Forum for Asia, a platform for dialogues among Asian government officials, business leaders and experts to promote economic exchange and corporation. The annual conference is held at Bo'ao every year. \nThe resort has 384 luxurious sea view rooms spread over 18 floors, offering a scenic view of the nearby mountains and the sea of Bo'ao. Each room is exquisitely furnished with a modern design and all the amenities needed for a comfortable stay, including complimentary wireless internet access. The hotel offers an excellent variety of recreational facilities, such as indoor and outdoor swimming pools, a sauna, a fitness centre and a full-service spa. It is a 15-minute drive from Bo'ao Golf and Country Club and Qionghai Bo'ao Oriental Culture Garden. \n\"Qingcheng Mountain is a representation of China's rich cultural heritage and the gem of Chengdu City,\" said Chen Xiaolan, general manager of Chengdu Shangshanqi Real Estate Co. Ltd. \"Given Shangshanqi's superb location at the foot of this iconic mountain, our affiliation with the worldwide leader in vacation exchange introduces a new travel lifestyle and is a strategic and mutually beneficial decision. It is in line with the Chinese government's direction to develop new business models for the travel industry, and it fulfills the needs of today's Chinese consumers who are constantly looking for ways to improve their quality of life. I hope that through our partnership with RCI, we will be able to present the best holiday options for our members to travel around the world.\" \n\"We are honoured to be in partnership with RCI, and we thank RCI for their confidence in us,\" said Jack Hu, CEO of Enwei Daoyuan Shengcheng Tourism Company. \"As the pioneer and global leader in vacation exchange, we believe that RCI will be able to successfully grow the vacation ownership industry in China. We look forward to working together for mutual benefit, and bringing vacation exchange in China to new heights.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T05:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T05:17:08.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
