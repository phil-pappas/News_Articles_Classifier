Additionally the fire boat was on its way to assist, however the team was told to stand down as it was not needed due to the short duration of the fire.\" \nHe added \"I would like commend the emergency services for their prompt response to the emergency even though in the end their assistance was not required as the crew on the ship had extinguished the blaze. The owners of the vessel Royal Caribbean International have also praised the Jamaican response.\" \nMinister of Tourism and Entertainment, Hon. Dr. Wykeham McNeill stated \"I am very pleased that the emergency was well handled and that our visitors have been able to continue their vacation by visiting several of Jamaica's world class attractions.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T11:03:15.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
