Photographer's Note \nXcalumkin - the place where fertile soil is exposed to the sun, and dating from 650 CE to 900 CE, is located about 12 kilometres east of Hecelchakan and 4 kilometres southwest of the pueblo known as Cumpich. Its geo coordinates in Google Earth are 20.10.19.77 N and 90.00.36.33 W and elevation at 34 - 36 metres. It was a small centre, different from others in which the powers that be were concerned to erect tall and large monuments. Here the rulers showed their power in the ornamentation in high relief that decorated public buildings, in early Puuc style. This ornamentation featured hieroglyphics including dates - the majority being from the middle of the 8th century, and figures of warriors and men appeared on the columns of buildings. When the word got out about the distinctive charm of Xcalumkin in the 1960s and 1970s, it became the target of looters who took what they could. Fortunately, INAH was able to place a few pieces here in the Museum of Maya Culture, Fort San Miguel, in Campeche. I believe them a star attraction. This piece, with its decoration, constitutes the entrance way to what surely was a palace. I intend to upload two more complementary photos to its artwork. One would see a similar structure as this at the palace in Tohcok, not that far distant from Xcalumkin. I regret not having visited the site of Xcalumkin, itself. \nNobody has marked this note useful", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T14:53:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
