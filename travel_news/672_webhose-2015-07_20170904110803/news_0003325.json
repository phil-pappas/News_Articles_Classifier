It’s just that the square in which we all live is such ripe terrain for a book. Furthermore, aren’t you supposed to write about what you know? And so I did. I wanted my debut novel to be a comedy and decided it would be called The Square . The setting shares similarities with the north London square where I have lived for 10 years. (I hope my neighbours will forgive me.) Living in squares may be seen as desirable, but it is a communal activity. You live so close to everyone else. Property is what’s important. If you have a garden that is longer than a neighbour’s, or you have planning permission for an extension, other people envy you. And indoors, until you’ve knocked through your basement kitchen to make one big, beautiful “living space” from several tiny units, you haven’t really arrived. (Savills) “You will never be able to sell your house because you haven’t knocked through your kitchen,” a neighbour once told me. Not that I wanted to sell the house; I had only just bought it. Yet I felt I had failed. I went and had coffee in the knocked-through kitchen of another neighbour to console myself. “Your kitchen is so lovely,” I said. She tossed her head. “We’re getting the whole thing ripped out. The previous owners complained of rats.” Shortly after, we knocked through our kitchen. The neighbours came to see it. As did their nannies. I was careful to give them all real coffee. This is because of a story a friend told me. Years ago, she worked as a nanny in a London square . Reaching for fresh coffee beans one morning, she was told by the mother of the family that it would be better if she had instant. “You want to give me instant coffee?” thought my friend. “I’m going to seduce your husband.” And she did. Have I used that anecdote in my book? What do you think? A communal garden square in London (Jeff Gilbert) I had a plethora of raw material. A garden square is a community of middle-class people who share a view. I thought of all the events I could access for my plot: Residents’ Association meetings, Christmas drinks, dinner parties and coffee mornings. It could make a brilliant story. There’s also the undercurrent of anxieties and frustrations in our square: from competition over where you send your children to school to arguments about noise (dogs, burglar alarms, parties) to rows over au pairs and jealousy over holiday plans. This keeps us engaged for months. But what about people who don’t live here? Would they find it interesting? And so I decided to use the square as a backdrop for a racier story than the reality. For, let’s face it, illicit sex is more fun than nannies and kitchens (though there is a scene in which they come together). Do I think my neighbours visit each other for any purpose other than to discuss the time of the rubbish collection? I have no idea – although when we moved here, a neighbour reported that a couple was told off for having frenzied sex with the windows open (clearly the pleasure of owning a house in this enclave is not enough for some). Conformity in behaviour is as important as the look of the houses, with their white facades and black railings. Extensions are frowned upon. When we arrived, we applied for a roof extension. “We have ways of dealing with people like them,” we overheard a neighbour say about us. Our application was refused. A relative of Mick Jagger lives on Rosie's square (Rex) Would this sort of thing go on in a street? Possibly, but there the notion of communal space doesn’t apply. Neighbours at each end of the road might never meet . Even though this is a tawdry part of London and our house used to back onto a shop generally accepted as a brothel, we feel lucky to be here. We have television companies filming here and a smattering of semi-famous residents. Someone nearby is related to Mick Jagger . Because everyone lives on top of each other, domestic concerns are the major topics of conversation. My novel examines attitudes to money and sex, but I could have investigated the private school debate or the row over who had fake grass in their garden . Yet it is a friendly place: people help each other out, lend parking tokens, offer lifts and contact each other with news. My urgent news recently was to tell my neighbours about The Square; my children call it “Mummy’s sex book”. The big reveal took place at a dinner party at my house. “You’ve done what?” yelled one of our lovely neighbours, after quite a lot of red wine. “I hope I am in it!” I was startled. His views were echoed by the rest of the party. At this point, I had to give them the bad news. “I’m afraid none of you are in it.” But they might find the setting familiar.
