The payment page said he would be charged £65.40 including VAT, plus 65p and a service fee for using his Visa to complete the transaction. No amount was given for the service fee, and he assumed it was included in the £65.40, so he clicked on ‘Complete booking’ and was shocked to find a confirmation page telling him he would be charged more than double the amount he expected.\nMatt said: ‘Obviously I’m kicking myself for not checking, but I’ve booked literally hundreds of flights in my time, and maybe there’s been the odd £5 to £10 service fee here and there for use of certain cards, but there’s no way they can justify charging that much.’\nFearing he had booked four flights by mistake, he called Fly.co.uk’s customer service department, only to be told the final price included a service fee.\nMatt said the price of the flight was listed as £65.40 before he entered his credit card details\nAfter he entered his credit card details and confirmed the booking, the final price was £146.65\n‘He just couldn’t tell me what the fee was for. He kept saying it’s a service fee, but when I asked what it was actually paying for, he said it was for the search engine.\n‘Then he suggested it was a payment for customer service. I said to him, “I could go into a travel agents and sit with a human being, taking up their time for an hour while they find me a flight and book it for me. That wouldn’t cost me £80. So how come I have to pay you £80 for an automated search engine on which I had to enter all the details myself and enter my card details myself?”\n‘Again, he didn’t really have any answers, although tellingly he refused to say it was good value for money, no matter how many times I asked him.’\nTo find a listing of service fees, customers must click a link, titled ‘Info’, that is in small font under flight search results.\nMatt added: ‘I kept asking the customer service guy what the charges were for – do you have to pay them to Visa? And he said they didn’t, it was their fee.\n‘So it’s kind of dressed up as a “Fee to the card issuer” but it’s not – there’s no reason for it to change depending on how you’re paying for the flights.\n‘I know I was daft not to read all the small print, but they’ve definitely gone out of their way to hide it.’\nUnder the terms and conditions page on its website, Fly.co.uk does not list the fees that it charges, and says it ‘may charge a booking service fee which will be notified to you separately during the booking process’.\nThe website said: ‘The amount of the service fee varies depending on number of people on the booking, the flight route booked and the utilization of other services.’\nMatt said a customer service representative told him the final price listed on the website does not update to reflect the service fee until the credit card number is entered.\nHe said: ‘By that point, I’d already checked the price, checked the VAT and all that malarkey and then right at the last minute as you’re about to click “Complete booking”, the price jumps up and, in my case, more than doubles.’", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1LZuPOY"], "published": "2015-07-10T16:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T13:43:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
