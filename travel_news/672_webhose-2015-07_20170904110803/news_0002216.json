The event, which takes place in ExCeL London’s ICC Capital Suite, is set to be the largest gathering of Angular developers in the world to date, with 1,000 international delegates expected. \nDelegates will be able to hear from the world’s leading Angular experts, including the entire core Angular team from Google, as well as connect with each other across a number of interactive spaces. AngularConnect co-organiser and Managing Director of White October Events, Ruth Yarnit, said: \"We’re programming the conference to serve the Angular community in Europe, and we’ve planned plenty of dedicated breakout spaces to allow attendees the opportunity to form strong links and engage in meaningful conversations with each other. We’re already welcoming delegates from around 20 European countries, and it’s our hope that every city in Europe will be represented at the conference\". Commenting on the move of AngularConnect, James Rees, Executive Director, ExCeL London said: “We are delighted to be welcoming AngularConnect to our International Convention Centre later this year. The launch of this event supports a growing trend of technology brands who are now choosing to host their event in London, with the likes of Adobe, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Salesforce.com and Hewlett Packard all running events at ExCeL this year. London represents the largest tech sector in Europe, with over 40,000 digital companies, so provides the ideal destination for an event such as AngularConnect.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T16:50:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
