When the volcanoes erupted on the island, much of the ground fell away, and this 98-foot deep hole was the result.\nSteps lead down to a ladder, which tourists can use to descend into the grotto, or use as an impromptu diving board (providing the water levels are high enough).\nFor those less brave, a tumble in from a board a matter of inches above the water may be the safer option.\nThe To Sua Ocean Trench on the Samoan island of Upolu offers swimmers a truly unique and unforgettable experience\nThe green landscape is matched by crystal clear waters, an abundance of tropical fish and a sandy bed. A series of canals leading from the pool to the South Pacific Ocean ensure the hole is never dried out.\nIn order to protect the serene spot, as well as maintain the safety of the visitor routes into the water, there is a charge to swim. It will cost adults £10 ($15), children £3.85 ($6.00), but is free to those under the age of seven.\nRELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next Magaluf holidaymaker passes out over and over again while...

Share this article Share The beauty of Samoan spot has not been lost on most who have visited it.\nWriting on TripAdvisor, Georgie P from Brisbane, Australia says: 'To Sua is one of the most unique, relaxing places I have been to. When I went there was only one other couple there so it was very peaceful.\nCraig02128 adds: 'A magical experience, swimming at the bottom of the grotto. If you are a strong swimmer, you can even swim underneath the rock tunnel and out to the ocean.\n'We visited the trench in May and absolutely loved it, the place is so beautiful and the water is warm and clear. Recommend visiting this paradise on earth,' writes Andrea R.\nThe pool is maintained by water flowing in from the South Pacific Ocean through a number of channels and tunnels\nVisitors to the trench are warned to take care when walking down the ladder, as expectedly, it can become slippery.\nCJB1985 adds on TripAdvisor: 'The climb down looks bad but if you take your time and wear sandals it's ok.'\nThe review website has scored To Sua Ocean Trench a four-and-a-half rating out of five based on visitors' reviews. Of the 401 people to have commented on the tourist attraction, 319 have rated it as 'excellent.'", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1GQnQ43"], "published": "2015-07-02T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T16:27:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
