Enrique only stayed in school until ninth grade and has found it a little disconcerting to return to the classroom, where he was the oldest in the group. “I felt like a kid again sharing with younger people but it has really been fun,” he says. Now he is itching to get on with his plans for a farm of his own. This is my chance to give me and my family a better life “As a soon as the project is done I plan to have my own business and start practising the things I have learnt,” he says. It has been a tough journey – tougher than for many of the other students. His father died just as Enrique started the course. “It was a huge loss,” he says. “I had to take care of my mother, wife and daughter. It has been a little more complicated…” He says it with quiet understatement. It means now that he is the only breadwinner for his family. So when he might have been earning a day's wage, he was sitting in the classroom thinking of a better future. And whereas before he drifted around trying to find a day's work and occasionally helping his stonemason father, Enrique has already now saved up enough money to buy a plot of land which he will soon plant with coffee. His plans have already brought some happiness back to the little concrete-block home he shares with his wife, mother and four-year-old daughter. Back to school: students working on the Kenco 'Coffee vs Gangs' project “He has worked so hard, and really wants to be a businessman in the coffee industry,” says Reyna Pinead, his mother. “He really deserves it.” The front door is wedged open, allowing a cooling breeze to circulate through the front room. The put-put sound of motorbikes wafts in. Reyna describes how hard it is for the young people of Yoro district to find work. The US remains an attractive destination for those willing to brave the journey and the trafficking gangs who control some of the routes. The next step for Enrique, says Reyna, is to try to find the financing he needs to turn his plans into reality. “We really hope it will receive funding but if not we will all pitch in and work really hard to help,” she says. Enrique stands outside the door as his mother and wife talk. Quietly he looks at the house and explains what it is all about. “This is my chance to give me and my family a better life,” he says. • To discover more about the Coffee vs Gangs project and read about gang culture in Honduras, visit telegraph.co.uk/coffeevsgangs You may also be interested in: • Video: Visiting the Coffee vs Gangs farm • The Honduras coffee region by numbers • Coffee production: from seedling to coffee cup", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T20:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T15:17:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
