The series is available for viewing on the all-new Orbitz Travel Guides app on Amazon Fire TV & Fire TV Stick as well as Orbitz.com/Illinois. Supported by hotel discounts of up to 20 percent and substantial flight and hotel package savings, this thirteenth installment of the “Orbitz Originals” series once again uses the power of online video to inspire travelers and increase bookings to one of the premier states of America’s heartland.\nResearch continues to point to the importance of destination video content in consumers’ purchasing behavior. YouTube has seen views of travel content spike by 118 percent year-over-year, according to a recent study and whitepaper released by Google. 1 The study also found that two out of three U.S. consumers watch online travel videos when they’re thinking about taking a trip, and that “searches on YouTube generally occur earlier in the travel-planning process…a strong video strategy can help brands reach, inspire and engage today’s digitally savvy traveler in more ways than ever before.”\n“Orbitz Originals: Illinois,” give viewers an intimate and in-depth account of the range of travel experiences that can only be found in Illinois. Destinations featured include Alton, Chicago, Galena, Lake County, Southern Illinois wine country, and Starved Rock State Park/Utica area.\nSome select highlights from the seven-part series:\nOrbitz Originals: Illinois – Chicago may be its crown jewel, but there’s plenty to do and see across the Prairie State. Orbitz and Richard Bangs show you the best of Illinois, where you can sample local wineries, hunt for ghosts and ride some roaring roller coasters. Along the way, you’ll also enjoy stunning natural features, family-friendly small towns and some of Chicago’s greatest cultural wonders. Thrill-seekers and families welcome – No matter how high your threshold for fun, Gurnee may blow you away. Get your adrenaline pumping as Bangs visits the many rides and roller coasters at Six Flags and the sprawling waterpark at KeyLime Cove Resort. Get back to nature at Starved Rock – Stray from the beaten track—and onto picturesque dirt trails—as Bangs explores the natural wonders of Starved Rock. He uncovers some of the best spots to disconnect from the daily grind, where you can enjoy canyons, waterfalls and forest trails as bald eagles soar overhead. Things that go bump in the night – Face your fears as Bangs experiences a brush with the paranormal at Mineral Springs Hotel. It’s the most haunted place in Alton, a Southern Illinois town with a spine-chilling reputation.\n“What makes Illinois so unique is the different types of experiences you can have here, from the world-class cultural mecca of Chicago to the tranquil beauty of Shawnee National Forest,” said Cory Jobe, Illinois state travel director. “Who better than Richard Bangs to take a close look at what makes Illinois so great, and discover the one-of-a-kind experiences that should put Illinois at the top of anyone’s must-visit list.”\nTo date, “Orbitz Originals” videos highlighting Cancun, the Cayman Islands, Qatar Airways, Vermont, Western Ireland, New York, Northern Ireland, Bradenton, Florida, Puerto Rico, Jackson Hole, and Bermuda and Australia’s Northern Territory have been viewed over 3.25 million times by travelers seeking inspiration for future trips.
