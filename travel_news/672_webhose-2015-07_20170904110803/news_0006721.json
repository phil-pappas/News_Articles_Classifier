A 170km high-altitude trail circling the entire range, the TMB is generally walked anti-clockwise in 11 daily stages, going from France into Italy and Switzerland, then back into France. It starts and ends at Les Houches, just south of the mountaineering town of Chamonix, which is this summer celebrating The Golden Age of Mountaineering : this being the 150th anniversary of the year in which 65 Alps were conquered.\n• Photographs: Andrew Gilchrist, Paul Boyd, Jackie Goldsmith\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Pinterest close Day one on the TMB\nA not-so-gentle introduction requiring an 18km hike from Les Houches to the village of Les Contamines , passing glaciers, woodland and fields full of vibrantly coloured flowers coming into bloom. This shaky crossing provides the first test of nerves: previous bridges here have been swept away. Today’s stretch eventually passes the lovely Auberge du Truc – get there by 5.30pm and they may let you milk the cows.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Pinterest close A spot of wildlife\nMarmots, basically large squirrels, though much cuter, are a common sight on the TMB, frequently coming close. This was seen on day two, on the 20km stretch from Les Contamines to Refuge des Mottets , close to the border with Italy. It was snapped near the snowline at the wind-blasted Tête Nord des Fours, a superb peak offering great views.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Pinterest close Border crossing\nThe superbly located Rifugio Elisabetta in Italy, reached on day three, a gentle 9km hike over the border from Refuge des Mottets. Elisabetta has a great grappa cabinet – but don’t overdo it and miss the sunrise over Val Veni, which stretches all the way down to Courmayeur.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Pinterest close On reflection\nAiguilles at dawn, seen from my window at Rifugio Elisabetta on day four. Following an old Roman road lined with streams, pools and lakes that reflect the jagged peaks of the mountains, the 18km walk from here to Courmayeur is mesmerising, taking you up high but still right in close to the massif.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Pinterest close Daredevil’s exploits\nThe TMB seen over my shoulder on day five, snaking away from the aiguilles over Courmayeur en route to Rifugio Bonatti 14km away. The mountain hut is named after the great explorer Walter Bonatti : photographs of his daredevil exploits line the walls, from shinning up through giant icicles to diving topless into mighty rivers. It’s an inspirational stop – and they do prunes for breakfast.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Pinterest close Swiss highlights\nFlowers in Val Ferret , below Rifugio Bonatti, seen on day six, which involves a 20km hike into Switzerland bound for the hamlet of La Fouly. In terms of wildflowers, this is one of the richest stretches of the TMB, with intense blues, purples, yellows and pinks accompanying you throughout.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Pinterest close Trunk call\nTwo of the tree-trunk carvings that dot the route to Champex , a 15km trek through pine-scented woodland from La Fouly. You pass here on day seven, having first hiked through idyllic Swiss villages full of slanting barns and chalets laden with window-boxes bursting with colour.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Pinterest close Stroll on\nNight falls over Champex on day seven, at a height of 1,466m. This Swiss village coiled round a beautiful lake is a delightful place for a leisurely evening stroll (preferably not in your walking boots) and a new bar and B&B called the Ptarmigan is a fine place for a lakeside drink.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Pinterest close Lazing on the ledge\nA great rock for a rest at the Fenêtre d’Arpette , at 2,665m the TMB’s highest point. It’s reached on day eight, a 14km walk to Trient through everything from grassland, forest, scree, unsteady boulders and thick snow (which I fell through up to my waist). There are great views of the Trient Glacier at the top and the descent to Trient is superb.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Pinterest close Northern exposure\nAn ibex poses for a shot on the way to the Aiguilles Rouges nature reserve . This is the start of the home straight on day nine, a tough 16km hike from Trient to the wonderful Lac Blanc with constant views of the Mont Blanc massif’s magnificent northern flank across the Chamonix valley. We crammed the final three stages into two days, in order to fit in a stay at the legendary refuge at Lac Blanc.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Pinterest close Close to the edge\nThe narrow balcony path overlooking the Chamonix valley en route to Lac Blanc becomes just a bit too narrow and balcony at points, especially with a 10kg bag on your back. Rails and ladders have been fixed to rocks where things become too precarious, which is often.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Pinterest close Cloud control\nDusk on day nine throws up this striking view of the Aiguille Verte, its dark vertical scars contrasting beautifully with the billowing clouds it’s nosing through.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Pinterest close A new dawn\nGlorious Refuge du Lac Blanc , 2,352m up and built beside a beautiful green lake that gives perfect reflections of the massif across the valley to the right. A half-board stay costs €55 and everyone gets to their dorm by 9.30, so as not to miss the astonishing sunrise. This was taken at dawn on day 10 (along with about 200 other photographs).\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Pinterest close A fitting climax\nDay breaking over the massif, reflected in Lac Blanc, later on day 10. Mont Blanc is on the right under snow. It’s a sensational spot, the climax of 10 extraordinary days, and we stayed and looked for about three hours, before beginning the 20km knee-popping descent back to Les Houches and a well-earned pint.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Pinterest close", "external_links": ["http://www.chamonix-mont-blanc-hiking.com/21fenetredel",
