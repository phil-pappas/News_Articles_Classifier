The property was remodeled through an $820,000 investment that helped create 18 jobs during its construction stage and 14 additional jobs in the hotel’s operations. \n“PRTC is focused on helping maximize all the possibilities of key places located near the beautiful coastal and rural areas in order to turn them into prime lodging options for our visitors. PRTC acts as a facilitator and supporter to the owners of these properties, who take structures and give them a new life to stimulate the growth of our tourism industry,” said Rivera Rocafort. \n“With the development of this property and the opening of Lucía Beach Hotel, we provide another option to travelers visiting Puerto Rico and locals who want to know the area better,” added López Molina, owner of the hotel’s operating company. \n“For the Economic Development Bank it’s a pleasure to see the development of Tropical Inns of Puerto Rico, since it’s a client with whom we have a very close relationship since 1996, when the EDB first financed the Palmas de Lucía project. Today, 20 years later, we can see how it continues to grow with the opening of Lucía Beach Hotel. During the last two decades, the bank has supported the five lodging facilities within the Tropical Inns hotel family. These five hotels are responsible for 104 jobs in the tourism industry,” added Cancel Planas. \nLucía Beach Hotel is located in front of Lucía Beach and offers all-inclusive packages. “With this hotel we diversify our tourist offering in the southeast region while creating new opportunities for economic development for businesses that will have a positive impact in the area,” concluded PRTC’s Executive Director.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T22:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T22:21:33.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
