Expert Videos \nHeading to Disney World this November for Thanksgiving? You'll find plenty to do to celebrate the holiday in the theme parks and resorts. The Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios and Disney's Animal Kingdom are all open on Thanksgiving day; so you can pick your favorite theme park and join in the turkey day fun. \nTip: Thanksgiving day will be crowded; be prepared to use Fastpasses , single rider lines and the rider switch program to make the most of a holiday visit. 1. See the American Adventure \nThe host pavilion of World Showcase in Epcot presents the American Adventure show, a memorable 45-minute journey through the history of America. This program is packed with innovative animatronics and visual effects and is stunning any time of year. Thanksgiving is an ideal time to be reminded of the country's humble beginnings — don't miss the pilgrim vignette in the beginning. \nTip: Arrive a bit early and catch a moving performance by the \"Voices of Liberty;\" an a capella group featuring some of Disney World's top vocal talent. 2. See a Parade \nIf you visit Disney World during Thanksgiving week you are in for a treat — not only will you get to see the Main Street Electrical Parade , but you will get to see Disney's Thanksgiving parade as well. See Mickey, Minnie and the gang dressed in Pilgrim finery, and wave to the guest of honor — the turkey! \nTip: Like any Disney parade, you'll need to find a place to sit at least 10 minutes before the parade starts to be sure you can see everything. 3. Have a Turkey Dinner \nJust because you are on vacation doesn't mean you need to miss out on a traditional Thanksgiving dinner with all the fixings. Many of Disney World's best restaurants offer a special Thanksgiving menu on the big day. Enjoy Thanksgiving \"under the sea\" at the Coral Reef in Epcot or have your meal in Colonial American style at the Liberty Tree Tavern in the Magic Kingdom . Wherever you choose, be sure to make reservations well in advance, or you may miss out. \nTip: All Disney World theme park restaurants will be open for Thanksgiving, but only some offer a special turkey day menu . You don't have to be a guest of a Disney World resort to enjoy a traditional Thanksgiving dinner ... just reservations. 4. GrabTurkey on the Go \nGrab a smoked turkey leg and bypass the Thanksgiving meals entirely. You'll still enjoy a satisfying meal, and be ready to hop aboard your favorite attractions with less of a wait. Time your ride for typical dinner times to avoid the longest lines. Pick up a turkey drumstick at the Lunching Pad in the Magic Kingdom and be thankful you won't have to wait long to ride the nearby Space Mountain . \nTip: Have the big traditional Thanksgiving meal at home before your trip or after you return home if you want to spend more time on the rides than at the table.
