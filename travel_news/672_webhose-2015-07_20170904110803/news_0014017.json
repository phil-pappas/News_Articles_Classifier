It will also feature a rooftop bar and restaurant.\nThe lifestyle Canopy brand was launched last year with properties to open in cities including London, Portland, Miami and Washington DC.\nHilton said the brand has been developed with four elements in mind — great neighbourhoods, comfort and design, more included value and a \"positively yours\" culture. Each hotel will utilise local design and food and drink.\n\"We have established a great relationship with Hilton Worldwide and Hilton Reykjavik Nordica, which we’ve opened and managed since October 2007,” said Magnea Thorey Hjálmarsdóttir, managing director, Icelandair Hotels.\n“Reykjavik is the perfect destination for the Canopy by Hilton brand, as the connection between this new lifestyle brand and dynamic city is strong. Canopy by Hilton will play a substantial role in further enhancing Reykjavik as an ideal destination choice for travellers seeking local fun, culture, and breath-taking nature.\"\nThe hotel will be operated by Icelandair Hotels, a subsidiary of Icelandair Group and a long term partner of Hilton Worldwide.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-07-01T20:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T20:48:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
