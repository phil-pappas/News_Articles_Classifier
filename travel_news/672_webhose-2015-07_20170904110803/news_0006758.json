Much of this is down to the service you provide and the way you keep close to your customer, plus the technology that gives you access to the best rates and allows you to be as flexible as possible when arranging corporate travel.” \nDelegates were also given further insight into how they can use Phenix to build their businesses, with the system enabling agents to make more margin through packaging accommodation and flights together, rather than booking them separately in the system. \nCommercial director Kirsten Hughes added that the company was “constantly developing the system with a clear focus to make it work for our corporate agents”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T19:22:39.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
