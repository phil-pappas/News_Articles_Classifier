Hotels - Airlines - CVBs - Destinations - people Haiti inaugurates new world class port Adv: Port Lafito, a world-class modern container port in Haiti, is open and operational Adv: \nMIAMI, FL - GB Group, a diversified group of industrial and trading companies, today announced with an inauguration event that Port Lafito, a world-class modern container port in Haiti, is open and operational. \nPort Lafito is Haiti’s first Panamax Port with state of the art equipment and technology. The multi-million dollar project, led by GB Group, is a private, public and international partnership between the Haitian government, the Haitian private sector and international financial institutions, including the Haitian State Bank - Banque Nationale de Credit S.A., Capital Bank, Fond de de Developpement Industriel (“FDI”), the International Finance Corporation (“IFC”), Nederlandse Financierings-Maatschappij voorOntwikkelingslanden NV (“FMO”), - the Dutch Development Bank, and Nationale D’assurance S.A (NASSA). \n“Port Lafito will breathe new life into Haiti by creating new jobs, training for skilled labor, and encouraging foreign investment and development. This project will make a significant impact on the national economy and have a beneficial impact on the more than 10 million people that live here,” said Reuven Bigio, CEO of GB Group. “We are proud to announce that the day has come where we can help bring Haiti to the forefront of modern logistics. None of this would have been possible without the support from our public and private partners, for which we are very grateful.” \nThe inauguration event hosted Haitian dignitaries, government officials and partners that made the critical infrastructure project possible. Remarks were made by Haitian President, Michel Martelly; Chairman of GB Group, Gilbert Bigio; GB Group CEO, Reuven Bigio; SSA Marine Senior Vice President, Carlos Urriola; and General Director of l'Autorité Portuaire Nationale (APN) d'Haïti, Alix Celestin. In addition, an International Sister Seaport agreement was signed between Port Lafito and PortMiami in order to collaborate on the exchange of information and ideas, with the aim to increase cargo and trade between ports. \nPort Lafito partnered with SSA Marine, the world's largest independent and privately-held marine terminal operator, to oversee the port and terminal operations. In addition, Port Lafito installed two Liebherr LHM 420 mobile harbor cranes that are the first of their kind in the Caribbean and finalized agreements with Evergreen Marine and King Ocean Services to include Lafito as a port of call. \nThe opening of Port Lafito is one step toward the larger development of Lafito Global, an economic zone which will include the international port & terminal, an industrial free zone, a business park and residential area among more. The development of Lafito Global will drive the creation of more than 25,000 new jobs in Haiti by 2020, foster a new vibrant economic social center, establish attractive regional logistics and become an industrial hub for the Caribbean.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T07:14:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
