They know that airlines have very strict guidelines as to the weight and dimensions of cases and bags that can be carried on board. Most homes do not have any means by which travelers can calculate the weight of their luggage and this can lead to a significant amount of guesswork.\nWith the release of the new Electronic Luggage Scale from Expert Traveler Accessories, travelers are able to easily and accurately weigh their bags with a pocketsize, digital scale that will measure up to 110lbs ( 50kg) in weight. As soon as bags exceed 20kg the Green LCD display turns red to indicate the bags are overloaded.\n\"The feedback from customers has been extremely satisfying\", said Rose Ilton, company spokesperson.\nTony C said, \"I loved the Spirit level inbuilt into this scale. It's a great addition. You can make sure that you are holding the device correctly, so that you can get an accurate reading.\"\nAccording to Robyn Van der Kley, \"Such a product is a God send, we traveled on many different airlines, recently, each had their own Excess Luggage restrictions, this scale was so handy- it saved us so much hassle and stress.\"\nCJ Miller also gave a review regarding the Luggage Scale and said, \"I wasnt sure how precise this would be and so I tested it against some other scales. Really surprising results - Spot On every time.Very happy to recommend to other travelers.\"\nWith such reviews coming from customers who have already used this product, people can already determine how effective and convenient this product is. Expert Traveler Accessories expects that more and more travelers will include this very helpful device into their personal Travel kit .\nAbout Expert Traveler Accessories\nExpert Traveler Accessories is a leading Global supplier of high quality Travel Accessories such as the Newly designed Pocket Scale .\n\"The company is determined to deliver exceptional service to all valued customers\" stated Company Customer Service Manager, Rose Ilton.\nContact\nRose\n456-358-999\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.
