Hotels - Airlines - CVBs - Destinations - people See for yourself how Hawaii tourism is doing Adv: \nJul 02, 2015 Adv: \nThe Hawaii Tourism Authority (HTA) has released video market updates from each of its global contractors for North America and Hawaii. \nThese videos include travel trend insights, upcoming in-market promotions, and opportunities to partner for the remainder of 2015. \nNorth America \nWith continual increases in airlift from the U.S. West (+11.1% to 2.9 million seats) and U.S. East (+9.2% to 369,439 seats) through May 2015, arrivals grew 9.2 percent to nearly 1.4 million visitors from the U.S. West and two percent to 743,185 visitors from U.S. East markets. Arrivals from Canada however were slightly down (-1.1% to 286,716), despite a 15 percent increase in air seats to 266,466. \nWhile visitor spending from the U.S. East market declined slightly during the first five months of the year (-1.7% to $1.5 billion), there were substantial increases in total expenditures from the U.S. West (+8.6% to $2.1 billion) and Canada (+4% to $637.7 million) markets, in comparison to last year. \nFor details on what the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau is doing to maintain overall growth from the North America market, watch the video here. \nMeet Hawaii \nThe Meetings, Conventions and Incentives (MCI) market declined slightly (-1% to 231,189) in comparison to the first five months of 2014. Visitors traveling on incentives increased 22.9 percent to 90,834 visitors, which helped to balance the drop in conventions (-16.3% to 105,759) and corporate meetings (-2% to 44,886) visitors, year-to-date through May.
