With hotels throughout the city and surrounding suburbs booked, Philadelphians have a chance to cash in on the visitors who are turning to an alternative for their accommodations – Airbnb. The short-term rental service was illegal in Philadelphia until earlier this summer when city officials changed zoning rules to allow the rentals in residential areas and subjected them to an 8.5 percent hotel tax . So now that city residents can legally operate as Airbnb hosts, here's a rundown – based on information provided by Airbnb – on what to know before turning over the house keys. How much should I set my price for? Hosts set their price depending on location, demand, rooms available, local taxes and other factors. It truly varies, but rooms in Philadelphia range anywhere from $25 to more than $1,000 a night. Averages hover around $200 a night. Who is responsible if my home or belongings are damaged? You can set a security deposit for your guests to protect against any damages. Airbnb also provides its Host Guarantee Program, which protects up to $1,000,000 in damages above the security deposit or for those who did not set one. Should I lock up my things? The Host Guarantee Program does not cover cash, collectibles, art, jewelry or pets so Airbnb suggests that hosts remove any valuables before renting out homes or rooms. How do I get paid? About a day after a guest arrives, Airbnb will issue a payout, but it may take a few more days for the money to show up in your account depending on the payment method in place. Are renters vetted by Airbnb? Airbnb does not perform background checks, or screen hosts or guests but reserves the right to do so. Airbnb, however, has a variety of safety features in place to make users more comfortable. The review system, available for both hosts and guests, gives feedback to other perspective users. In addition, a “Verified ID” feature requires users to provide one or more of the following: a photo, phone number and email address, and a social media account. Can I stay in my home while renting it out to guests? Some hosts are comfortable with leaving their keys with a neighbor or in a mailbox while traveling themselves. Others prefer to stay home and continue their normal routines while guests are free to come and go. What, if anything, do I need to provide guests? Airbnb only suggests that hosts provide soap, toilet paper, sheets and towels. Many hosts also provide accommodations like a hair dryer, shampoo, an iron, an umbrella and other items. You can list the amenities you'll offer on your profile. Should I clean out my fridge? Every host is different. Some hosts place restrictions on parts of their home, making the kitchen or other areas off-limits to guests. Others allow use of the kitchen and even offer to leave an open space in the refrigerator for their guests' groceries or restaurant leftovers. Do I need to tell my neighbors? Hosts aren’t required to tell their neighbors, but’s a common courtesy to inform them about strangers coming in and out of your house. Airbnb does have a “neighbor hotline” for anyone with questions or concerns – 1-888-927-4459. Airbnb “encourages hosts to think carefully about their responsibilities.” The service provides a list of “Hospitality Standards” that includes suggestions on improving communication, amenities, cleanliness and more. The better a guest’s experience, the better a review he or she will give and the more likely that another guest will rent from that host again. \nWant Philadelphia Travel   Home of the Day", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T21:09:11.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
