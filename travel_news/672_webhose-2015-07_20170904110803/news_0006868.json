CITY SLICKERS\nTry this\nIt may not have indoor ski centres, Ferrari theme parks or global sporting events, but Muscat is still far and away the most pleasant municipality on the Arabian Peninsula.\nSpread out along a narrow coastal strip, this whitewashed city of two million people isn’t flush with unmissable sights though it contains enough to keep visitors occupied.\nYou’ll find royal palaces, ministry offices, centuries-old coastal forts, museums and markets in Old Town Muscat and Muttrah, and the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque – one of the largest in the world – further west.\nNext best\nMuscat’s smaller sibling, Salalah, is even more laid-back than the capital. Empty surf beaches surround the hub of the ancient frankincense trade. Time your visit well and you might even share them with migratory flamingoes.\n2. COUNTRY ROADS\nTry this\nThe Samail Gap, connecting Muscat with the interior of Oman, is the only place where the Hajar Mountains part naturally. A more adventurous route through, from one side to the other, is via Wadi Bani Awf.\nYou’ll need a full day and a four-wheel drive to negotiate an unsealed road that dissects creeks, squeezes through gorges, connects terraced mountain villages and accesses staggering views.\nNext best\nIt’s gravel all the way but the alpine road up Jebel Shams, Oman’s highest peak, is simply stunning. You’ll pass rice and barley fields and abandoned stone houses as you climb to a plateau that drops away dramatically into An Nakhur Gorge – Oman’s version of the Grand Canyon in the US.\n Tourists swim in a rock pool in Wadi Bani Khalid.

Then you’ll want to find a natural rock pool.\nThere’s no better place to cool down than in the crystal-clear waters of the Bimmah Sinkhole, 125km east of Muscat. Measuring 40m wide by 20m deep, it was formed when the limestone surface rock collapsed due to erosion from the tidal waters seeping in below.\nNext best\nIt’s a short walk into Wadi Bani Khalid from the end of a blacktop road, where date palms stretch out over an assortment of rock pools with varying degrees of privacy. Head upstream if you want a pool to yourself, or stay closer if jumping off rocky perches into the water is more your scene.\n4. SANDS OF TIME\nTry this\nSpending a night in the rolling sand dunes of the Wahiba Sands desert region is the one experience I would recommend. Accommodation varies from simple barasti structures or Bedouin camel hair tents to top-end luxury tented camps.\nClimb the dunes for stupendous views at first or last light. Or try any number of fun-filled activities, from four-wheel-drive dune bashing to sand boarding, camel riding or falconry.\nNext best\nA toss-up, depending on your comfort requirements. East of Muscat, near the mouth of Wadi Tiwi, is White Beach, where you can pitch a tent and enjoy late-night bonfires. Or within the Greater Muscat region, there’s the Shangri-La hotel complex at Barr Al Jissah. Here, you’ll find a picture-perfect bay shouldered by golden headlands where turtles come to nest.\n Watching the sunset from a desert dune in the Wahiba Sands.

HOLD THE FORT\nTry this\nSome 500 or so forts and watchtowers that predate the Portuguese occupation of Oman in the 16th century are scattered across the country’s many hilltops. The best preserved is Jabrin Fort.\nJabrin was originally built as a palace by a local imam and its fitted rooms and painted ceilings allow visitors an insight into how it might have looked. It’s even believed that the fort was home to one of Oman’s first schools, back in the 17th century.\nNext best\nBahla – Oman’s biggest fort – opened to the public in 2014 after 25 years of restoration efforts. It’s still a work in progress though – rooms are largely empty and unidentified.\n Omani man at a viewpoint overlooking Bahla Fort — the largest in Oman. Picture: Mark Daffey Source: Supplied\n6. JUST DHOW IT\nTry this\nA recent addition to Muscat’s maritime fleet is Ocean Blue International’s MY Ibra . It’s mostly day-trippers who charter this luxury dhow, but those with more time and deeper pockets might want to consider an overnight stay, anchoring inside the sublimely peaceful Bandar Khiran inlet, east of Muscat.\nIt’s fitted with extremely comfortably bedding for eight people and contains spacious kitchen, dining and lounge areas. Throw on a mask and snorkel then swim over to a nearby reef, where it’s likely resident turtles will join you.\nNext best\nArguably more spectacular, though less accessible from Muscat, is the trip through Khor Ash Sham in the Musandam region. This full-day cruise travels through fjordland to reach Telegraph Island, a vital communications station for relaying messages between colonial India and Britain. Keep an eye out for dolphins frolicking among the bow waves.\n Alila Jabal Akhdar Resort, perched on the canyon rim of Wadi Muaydin. Picture: Mark Daffey Source: Supplied\n7. SUMMER NIGHTS\nTry this\nSummer temperatures along coastal and inland Oman can exceed 50C. So what do you do? Head for the mountains.\nThe Hajar Mountains rise to heights of more than 3000m. Up here, it can be 20C cooler than down below – an ideal climate for growing citrus fruits and nuts.\nIf your budget allows for just one splurge accommodation-wise, be sure to reserve a night at the Alila Jabal Akhdar. A word of warning though – you’ll wish you could have stayed longer.\nNext best\nOmanis like to escape the summer heat in the Dhofar region, where monsoonal rains and cloud keep temperatures to comfortable levels.\nAlternatively, the hundreds of date palm plantations scattered throughout the country provide ample shade against the sun. The villages of Misfat Al Ayabreen and Birkat Al Mawz are perfect places to relax beneath floral canopies.\n Nizwa’s Friday livestock market. Picture: Mark Daffey Source: Supplied\n8. MARKET FORCES\nTry this\nIf you’re anywhere near the town of Nizwa on a Friday, make it a point to keep that morning free so you can attend the weekly livestock market.\nVillagers from all around meet in a stony courtyard outside the fort walls to buy and sell cattle, sheep and goats then cart them home in the back of pick-ups and trucks.\nYou’ll have to get up early though. Most of the action is done and dusted by 10am.\nNext best\nTake your pick from the centuries-old Muttrah Souk for antiques and artefacts, the Thursday market in Sinaw, ladies day in Ibra each Wednesday or the morning fish markets in Muttrah and Barka.\nThe writer travelled as a guest of the Sultanate of Oman Tourism.\n The luxury dhow MV Ibra approaches Jebel Sifah marina near Muscat.
