And while I don't remember a single fish any of us caught, I do recall the peace of those high mountain lakes.\nWhen my brother died at age 15, we scattered his ashes at one of our favorite fishing spots, American Lakes near Gould. I haven't been fishing since.\nMy dad, who first picked up a pole as a 7-year-old growing up in Montana's Flathead Valley, still communes with the fish at least once a week March to December. He took my daughters a few times when they were barely old enough to hold a pole, but they never saw the appeal of waiting around for the opportunity to watch something slimy flop around on the rocks within touching distance of their feet.\nBut fishermen don't give up easily, so Dad and I brought along two guides on the Vail trip to make the fishing conditions for the girls as ideal as humanly possible.\nAdvertisement \"Ideal\" is actually the first word that came to mind as we pulled into Red Draw Ranch. The trout-stocked ponds, creeks and waterfalls were surrounded by so many daisies there was more white than green. Pine-filled hillsides hid the nearby highway, giving way only to the taller peaks behind. The setting was so perfect I felt like I was revisiting a memory instead of making one.\nNot slowed by the scenery, the rest of the crew made a mad dash to the closest pond.\nI reached for my camera to try to capture the moment but was interrupted by my younger daughter holding her hands about 18 inches apart and shouting, \"Mama! Mama! I can see a fish, and it's THIS BIG!!\" Wow, these guides work fast. We hadn't even been on the water 30 seconds and she had already had the first lesson in fishing: how to lie about the size of fish.\nSkeptically I walked over to the side of the pond and took a look. Sailing through the clear water was not only one fish that size, but three.\nI've never seen my father move as quickly as when he reached for a fly rod. What happened next was almost as amazing as the size of those fish — he offered the rod to my daughters first.\nAll of a sudden everyone was as panicky as a 6-year-old trying to find money as the ice cream truck comes down the block. Here's where the beauty of having a guide comes in. Bill and Mike handed us rods loaded up with fishes' favorite flies, told us where to cast them and how to maneuver them once they got there.\nMy younger daughter was the first to get a bite. The monster struck with so much force that it broke her line. From then on, she held onto her pole with both hands, like it was the rope in a tug-of-war. After Bill tied on a new fly, she couldn't get back in the game fast enough.\nI've never seen her so patient, a quality that I've often tried (and failed) to cultivate.\nEvery time she wanted to give up, another lunker would bend her pole down to the water. She was hooked.\nDespite bites all around, my dad was the only one to land a fish that day. That said, I believe his granddaughter's interest in the sport was his real catch. The two of them were already planning their next fishing trip when it was time to leave the ponds.\nChryss Cada is a freelance writer and adjunct professor of journalism at Colorado State University.
