Credit: flickr.com/ Rosemary \nCould a GPS satellite collar be the answer to South Africa's extensive poaching problem? One non-profit organisation believes so... \nA British-led team from non-profit organisation Protect has developed a new anti-poaching device aimed at saving rhinos from poachers. \nThe Protect RAPID (Real-time Anti Poaching Intelligence Device) combines a GPS satellite collar with a heart rate monitor and a video camera. \n\"Broadcasting 24/7 real time information to a control centre, anti-poaching teams can be alerted and dispatched to poaching events within seconds of them taking place,\" the organisation said in a statement. \nSo while the device doesn't prevent the animal from being targeted, it will alert rangers at the onset of a poaching event so that they may respond before the animal is harvested and killed. \n\"With this device, the heart rate monitor triggers the alarm the instant a poaching event occurs, pinpointing the location within a few metres so that rangers can be on the scene via helicopter or truck within minutes, leaving poachers no time to harvest the valuable parts of an animal or make good an escape,\" Dr Paul O'Donoghue, chief scientific advisor for Protect, said in a statement. \n\"You can't outrun a helicopter, the Protect RAPID renders poaching a pointless exercise.\" \nThe technology would not only be implemented to protect rhinos, but could also be used for elephants, tigers and other highly poached endangered species. \nDean Peinke, specialist mammal ecologist for the Eastern Cape Parks and Tourism Agency, has expressed his support for the device. \n\"We simply don't know where or when poachers might strike, to effectively patrol these vast landscapes requires an army and still poachers could find a way through; they are well organised and equipped, and they will find gaps in almost any defence because the rewards are so great,\" he said in a statement. \n\"These devices tip the balance strongly in our favour, if we can identify poaching events as they happen we can respond quickly and effectively to apprehend the poachers; it's very exciting to be able to work with Protect on the first field trials of the Protect RAPID with our own Southern black rhino population.\" \nPrototypes of the device are being tested in the field in South Africa, according to Protect director Steve Piper. \nThis involves finding the best place for the camera component of the device to be painlessly implanted into a rhino's horn. \nBritish comedian Ricky Gervais has also come out in support of the project, calling on the public to support Protect. \nFind out more about Protect on their site .
