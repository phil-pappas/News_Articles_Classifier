Click through the gallery to see some new members of both lists, including the only U.S. site added in 2015 (shown here). Hide Caption 1 of 10 UNESCO World Heritage picks for 2015 10 photos San Antonio Missions, Texas. The new San Antonio Missions World Heritage site includes a group of five 18th-century frontier mission complexes along the San Antonio River basin in southern Texas -- the most famous of which is the Alamo -- and a ranch south of the missions. Built by Franciscan missionaries in the 18th century as part of Spain's efforts to colonize the region, the site includes churches, farmland, homes and water distribution systems. Shown here is the Mission Espada complex. Hide Caption 2 of 10 UNESCO World Heritage picks for 2015 10 photos \"Bethany Beyond the Jordan\" baptism site (Al-Maghtas), Jordan. This is where many believe Jesus of Nazareth was baptized by John the Baptist. Located on the eastern bank of the River Jordan north of the Dead Sea, Jordan's newest World Heritage site actually consists of two sites: Al-Kharrar, also known as Jabal Mar-Elias (Elijah's Hill), and the area of the churches of St. John the Baptist. A place of Christian pilgrimage, the archaeological site contains Roman and Byzantine remains, including churches and chapels, a monastery and hermits' caves. The remains of the Church of the Arc site are shown here. Hide Caption 3 of 10 UNESCO World Heritage picks for 2015 10 photos Champagne hillsides, houses and cellars, France. France's historic hillsides and properties where the sparkling wines of Champagne are produced, shown here, and the famous vineyards that grace the slopes of Burgundy were both honored with a World Heritage listing. The Champagne region's secondary bottle fermentation method of producing sparkling wines dates to the early 17th century. The Burgundy designation includes the town of Dijon, whose political system gave rise to the region's climate production system and the villages and vineyards that are the commercial aspect of the production system. Hide Caption 4 of 10 UNESCO World Heritage picks for 2015 10 photos Aqueduct of Padre Tembleque Hydraulic System, Mexico. A 16th-century aqueduct between the states of Mexico and Hidalgo, this stunning canal system includes arcaded aqueduct bridges, canals, springs and distribution tanks, including the highest single-level arcade ever built in an aqueduct. UNESCO calls the hydraulic system, launched by the Franciscan friar Padre Tembleque, \"an example of the exchange of influences between the European tradition of Roman hydraulics and traditional Mesoamerican construction techniques, including the use of adobe.\" Hide Caption 5 of 10 UNESCO World Heritage picks for 2015 10 photos Christiansfeld, a Moravian Church settlement, Denmark. Founded in 1773, Christiansfeld is a world-renowned planned settlement of the Moravian Church, which was planned and constructed to represent the Protestant urban ideal of a town built around a central church square. (The church square is shown here.) The buildings are still used by the Moravian Church community. Hide Caption 6 of 10 UNESCO World Heritage picks for 2015 10 photos Singapore Botanical Gardens, Singapore. Located in the heart of Singapore, Singapore Botanical Gardens shows the evolution of a British tropical colonial botanic garden. Now a scientific institution focused on conservation and education, the site includes historic buildings and plants that have evolved since the gardens were created in 1859. The garden's Swan Lake is shown here. Hide Caption 7 of 10 UNESCO World Heritage picks for 2015 10 photos Fray Bentos Cultural-Industrial Landscape, Uruguay. The 1859 construction of a meat-processing factory started an industrial complex on land near the Uruguay River, west of the Uruguayan town of Fray Bentos. The site, which illustrates the full scope of meat processing, includes the buildings and equipment of two meat processors that exported meat to Europe. Hide Caption 8 of 10 UNESCO World Heritage picks for 2015 10 photos Endangered: Hatra, Iraq. A large fortified city in what is now northwest Iraq, Hatra is one of three sites named in 2015 to the List of World Heritage in Danger. The site was named to UNESCO's World Heritage List in 1985. Hatra became powerful due to the Parthian Empire's influence and served as the capital of the first Arab Kingdom. Though Hatra survived Roman invasions in A.D. 116 and 198, the ancient city with its mix of Hellenistic and Roman architecture may not survive the current violence in Iraq. Hide Caption 9 of 10 UNESCO World Heritage picks for 2015 10 photos Endangered: Old City of Sana'a, Yemen. Yemen's Old City of Sana'a (shown here) and the Old Walled City of Shibam were also named to the List of World Heritage in Danger. Sana'a, whose al-Mahdi Mosque dates to the 12th century, and its surrounding neighborhood have been seriously damaged in armed conflict. The Old Walled City of Shibam, which dates to the 16th century and is an excellent example of vertical construction, is also under threat from the current conflict.
