Most of the passengers were Chinese. \nSearch efforts led by Australia have focused on a broad expanse of the southern Indian Ocean. \nNeither the French civil aviation authority DGAC nor the BEA, the agency responsible for investigating aviation accidents, were immediately available for comment. \n(Reporting by Emmanuel Jarry; and Matthias Blamont; Editing by Andrew Callus and Kevin Liffey) Share or comment on this article 7 Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.
