A total of 56% of the participants have depression or depressive symptoms, find the researchers. \n\"In an era where more and more men are being tested for Low T - or lower levels of testosterone - there is very little data about the men who have borderline low testosterone levels,\" says lead researcher Michael Irwig, associate professor of medicine at the George Washington University. \n\"We felt it important to explore the mental health of this population,\" Irwig adds. \nFurthermore, one quarter of the men in the study are taking antidepressants and men have high rates of obesity and low rates of physical activity. \nThe most common symptoms are erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, fewer morning erections, low energy, and sleep disturbances. \nThe results suggest that doctors should consider screening for depression and depressive symptoms, overweight and unhealthy lifestyle factors in men who are referred for tertiary care for potential hypogonadism, a condition in which the body does not produce enough testosterone.
