From my hilltop vantage point I gazed across a tremendous lake draped in mist and surrounded by a great swathe of fir trees. A luminous quality to the light added to the drama of standing on hallowed ground. In this country of hushed, snowclad winters, golden summers and prodigious forests, the rousing yet serene music of Jean Sibelius’s Finlandia is practically a national anthem and they say it was probably inspired by this view over Lake Aulanko. Probably: the element of equivocation contributed to the feeling of having stepped into a magnificent legend. A couple of residents in the town of Hameenlinna had directed me to this famous spot in the Aulanko Nature Reserve, adding that to appreciate the spirit of Sibelius I should listen as much as look. So I tuned into the quiet, increasingly absorbed by the percussion of wind in the trees and the hammering of a woodpecker. • The Northern Lights: Trip of a Lifetime I had come to this big little country (marginally smaller than Germany, Finland has a population of 5.5 million) at the outset of commemorations for the 150th anniversary of the composer’s birth. From China and Japan to the United States and Britain, a host of events this year bear testimony to how much the music of Sibelius is globally admired. For Finns, Sibelius is the equivalent of Elgar and Shakespeare in one; a cultural colossus who encapsulates the spirit of the country. In 1865, when he was born, Finland had been governed by Russia for 56 years. By the time independence was granted in 1917, Sibelius had written many major works including five symphonies and a number of stirring orchestral pieces, such as the Karelia Suite, most of them largely composed as expressions of Finnish nationalism. As the country subsequently struggled through civil war, then world war, then the tense years of the Cold War (with the Soviet Union looming over an 830-mile border), the music of Sibelius was a balm of Finnishness. Set in or close to Helsinki, the most important Sibelius sites are wonderfully easy to reach Photo: AP/FOTOLIA Set in or close to Helsinki, the most important Sibelius sites are wonderfully easy to reach. From Helsinki Airport (there’s currently a campaign to rename it Sibelius Airport) I headed to Hameenlinna, birthplace of the composer, about an hour’s drive away. It is Finland’s oldest inland town, dominated by a medieval castle and well placed for walks: Aulanko Nature Reserve is a few miles from the centre and was a favourite haunt of Sibelius as a boy. In later life he said he was thinking of this landscape when he wrote Finlandia, although whether he had a specific view in mind is not clear. • Winter in Lapland: deer, dogs and dashing through the snow Having made my Aulanko pilgrimage, I took a tour around town pausing at a new Sibelius centre (set up last year for chamber concerts and as a shop); the school Sibelius attended; the street where he grew up in his grandmother’s house; and, opposite, the little town park, now named Sibelius Park, where neighbours came to eavesdrop on the young boy practising the violin. To mark the Sibelius anniversary, five benches have been ingeniously transformed into little music stations: as you sit down, his Tree piano pieces (for aspen, rowan, spruce, pine and birch) variously strike up from a box beneath you. I spent some time playing an inverse version of musical chairs then moved on to visit what must be Hameenlinna’s most charming attraction, the house where Sibelius was born. At this small clapboard property you see a remarkable collection of original items, from thank-you letters written by the young Sibelius (his manners were impeccable, I was told) to the square piano at which he was introduced to music. You learn that Sibelius’s father was the town doctor also treating Russian troops garrisoned here and that he died of typhoid fever before the composer’s third birthday. And you listen to music by Sibelius as you wander round. The composer in 1940 Photo: GETTY That afternoon I travelled south to Helsinki, where Sibelius studied music, married and became a bon viveur – as well as a successful, if cash-strapped, composer. Here Karri Korppi runs the appositely named Happy Tours Helsinki and took me on a Sibelius walk. We started in the neoclassical Senate Square, built, Karri explained, by the Russians who at first wanted to turn Helsinki into a mini St Petersburg. The composer’s first masterpieces were performed at the University of Helsinki on the west side, and the great white domed cathedral on the north side was where his funeral was held on September 30 1957 (17,000 people filed past the coffin to pay their respects the night before). We walked along the leafy esplanade, whose bars were frequented by Sibelius, and called in at the city’s public music library to hear some of the composer’s most impassioned melodies. (Reflecting Finland’s public-spirited culture, Helsinki has 36 libraries, one with bikes to borrow, another with skis; and at the music library there’s even a recording studio.) Continuing north, we walked through the park at Toolonlahti Bay, a sea inlet that brings seabirds into the heart of the city – very Finnish, very much in tune with Sibelius – and strode through the Toolo district, pausing outside Sibeliuksenkatu 11, where the composer and his family had an apartment (sadly, there is no scope to enter). We finished at the Sibelius monument. Overlooking the sea is another Sibelius Park, a wondrous, organ-like structure devised by the sculptor Eila Hiltunen in 1962 and whistling softly in a steady breeze on the day I visited. Inside Ainola, the composer's former home Photo: ALAMY The next morning I headed to Lake Tuusula. In the late 1890s a number of artists and writers avidly championing Finnish freedom settled here: the authors Juhani Aho and Juhana Heikki Erkko; the painters Venny Soldan-Brofeldt, Pekka Halonen and Eero Jarnefelt (never mind that the names are near-impossible to pronounce; it adds to the mystique of this beyond-Scandinavian nation). For Sibelius, Lake Tuusula was a magnet not only because of this community; he was also drawn here by what he described as the miraculous calm. He and his wife Aino chose a plot near the lake where they had a wooden house built, which they called Ainola (Aino’s villa). They moved in during September 1904. • The world's costliest room service Jarvenpaa at Lake Tuusula is just a 20-minute train ride from Helsinki. What a gateway to art: I took about five paces from its station and entered the town’s exceptional gallery. It holds a cache from the Tuusula art community which it displays in changing exhibitions. This year’s show is about the multi-talented Aino Sibelius, who designed furniture for Ainola, created its superb garden and even devised the sauna. The Sibelius monument Photo: AP/FOTOLIA The exhibition is a fine prelude to visiting Ainola itself. For conservation reasons this hugely revered house is open only in spring and summer. And beautifully preserved it is too. I felt the Sibelius family might have been there only a few days before. The clock given as a wedding present still chimes (it is carefully wound every week, even in winter), Sibelius’s record player stands open, and his cigar box is set on his desk beside a folio (well, a copy) of Symphony No 4. The one big change is that there is running water in the house today: Sibelius insisted on utter quiet with no gurgling pipes. • The world's most powerful passports The artist Eero Jarnefelt was a brother of Aino Sibelius and lived across a field from Ainola. His house, Suviranta, is now home to his grandson Juhani Kolehmainen who opens it to visitors just a few times a year. I was fortunate in my timing and was welcomed into a light-filled studio lined with paintings. “Did you ever meet Sibelius?” I asked. “Well of course,” he said. He remembered how his great uncle, always impeccably dressed in a white linen suit, would take daily lakeside walks to watch the swans and cranes. Then, marvelling at how Sibelius was very particular about sounds and nature, Mr Kolehmainen recalled that the composer had said that his Symphony No 3 should be played not just like a bird, but specifically a garden warbler. Harriet O’Brien flew to Helsinki from London Heathrow as a guest of Finnair ( finnair.com ). For more information about Finland and Sibelius, see visitfinland.com and sibelius150.fi . Hameenlinna This historic university city, about 60 miles north of Helsinki, was where Jean Sibelius was born on December 8 1865.
