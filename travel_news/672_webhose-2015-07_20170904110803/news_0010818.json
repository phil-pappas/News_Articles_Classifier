Quito, Ecuador, July 02, 2015 --( PR.com )-- Ecuador Freedom Bike Rental and Motorcycle Tours proudly announced today that they have become the first motorcycle tour operator in the world to become a member of “Pack for a Purpose,” a community-based project which is supported by tour operators, hotels & resorts in 56 countries around the world.‘Pack for a Purpose’ provides travelers with up to date information regarding the supplies needed in the communities of their travel destinations. By creating just a few kilos of space in their suitcases and bringing supplies for schools or medical clinics in need, the initiative allows tourists to create a lasting and priceless impact on the lives of children and families living in the local areas.With the help and coordination of Pack for a Purpose, Ecuador Freedom Bike Rental and Tours has begun assisting and supporting 13 schools in rural Ecuadorian villages. The isolated village schools are located along the paved and unpaved routes of Ecuador Freedom’s motorcycle tours, where few tourists and outsiders are able to visit. Participants in the motorcycle tours may voluntarily participate in the program by making space in their saddlebags for the needed school supplies and equipment. The motorcycle tour groups will make stops at the selected schools and distribute the resources personally during its several scheduled tours throughout the year.Every traveler to Ecuador can participate in the program even if they don’t ride a motorcycle. Donations of items brought to Ecuador may be made in person at the company’s Adventure Motorcycle Travel Center, located in Quito. For a list of requested supplies for the projects can be found at http://www.packforapurpose.org/destinations/south-america/ecuador/ecuador-freedom-bike-rental-and-tours “Pack for a Purpose is delighted to welcome Ecuador Freedom Bike Rental & Tours as our newest participant in Ecuador and our very first motorcycle touring company,” stated Rebecca Rothney, Founder and Chairperson. “We are honored to be able to showcase the wonderful work they are doing in the communities they visit. Their participation allows us to reach a new set of travelers, those who tour on motorcycles. We have no doubt they will also want to Pack for a Purpose so that the trip they take will go much farther than the miles they travel.”“As a company we are committed to finding ways to support the local communities that make our motorcycle tours so special,” stated Court Rand, co-owner of the Quito-based motorcycle tour operator. \"I am thrilled that we are now working with Pack for a Purpose to support our goals of positively giving back to the community.\"About Ecuador Freedom Bike RentalLocated in the historic capital city of Quito, Ecuador Freedom Bike Rental is the country’s first motorcycle tour operator.
