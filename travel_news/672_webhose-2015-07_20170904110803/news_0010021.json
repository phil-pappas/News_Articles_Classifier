With a record 61,300 students accepted through Clearing last year - up from 57,100 in 2013 - the process has become so much more than a Plan B. In fact, many students now use Clearing to find a better course at a university more suited to their requirements. • Download the Telegraph's Clearing app for iPhone and Android Last year, 13,800 students found places directly through Ucas Clearing, while 1,160 'traded-up' with their better grades through Adjustment . The choice available means that this is the ideal time to be in control of your options. Already this year, 14 out of 24 elite Russell Group universities were listing vacancies on their courses, with over 2,500 courses advertised when listings went live on July 6. While Clearing may have closed again for applications, when the full vacancy list is published at 6pm on August 12, you can be sure that many of these universities will be on the lookout for applicants. As Ucas's exclusive media partner for Clearing, the Telegraph has several useful resources, to make sure your experience of Clearing and Results Day runs smoothly. • Check out our step-by-step guide to Clearing Our free Clearing app, available on both iPhone and Android , is back. Last year, over 100,000 students downloaded the app, which gives you the chance to browse the full Clearing vacancy list, 24 hours a day, in real time. Spaces will be advertised from 6pm on August 12 (the day before Results Day), but you won't be able to officially apply until you have your results in hand - and have been entered into Clearing - on August 13. If you already have your results, feel free to start applying when the list is released. Students can prioritise their search by course, institution or location, and all of the listings will be accompanied by essential details, including telephone numbers for the institutions’ admissions offices, and Ucas course codes. Clicking on an institution's telephone number will call that university's Clearing department. If you aren't able to get the app, do not fear. All the same details will be available online at clearing.telegraph.co.uk , while The Daily Telegraph will also publish listings twice in print, the first on A-level Results Day itself, and the second on August 15. For essential advice in the lead up to the day, visit the Telegraph's Clearing Hub , where experts will talk you through the process, and give top tips on researching ahead of the day . The section also includes guides to Adjustment , last minute student finance and finding accommodation .
