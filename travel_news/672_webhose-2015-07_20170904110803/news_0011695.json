The car was later found in Newark.\nAccording to police accounts, a patrolling Saddle River cop happened upon a running car along Twin Brooks Road just after 3 a.m. As the officer approached the car, it quickly reversed, nearly slamming into the patrol unit as it fled.\nA man who'd been standing near the suspicious vehicle disappeared into the nearby woods, close to the Ho-Ho-Kus border, police said.\nPolice from surrounding towns spent five hours, using two K-9 units, to search for the man to no avail. It is believed the patrolling officer interrupted an attempted car theft.\nThe previous morning, a Saddle River resident reported a car missing from a driveway.\nIn both instances, the cars were unlocked, with their key fobs left inside.\nPolice in Ridgewood believe there is a connection between the June 24 car theft in Saddle River and the theft of a backpack from an unlocked car on Bennington Terrace. The bag was found near the Chestnut Ridge Road and Normandy Drive area, close to the scene of the car theft.\nPolice in all three towns have issued reminders to residents, urging them to lock their cars and remove valuable items from them.\n\"People need to lock their cars,\" Minchin said. \"We've got all kinds of people coming through. I wish we did live in a bubble, but that's just not the case.\"\nâ€” Chris Harris", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T09:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T14:05:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
