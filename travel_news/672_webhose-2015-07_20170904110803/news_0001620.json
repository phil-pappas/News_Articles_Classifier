The 1920s beauty had hit record room occupancy under the glam Thompson Hotels umbrella, but Chang and Gaw felt it needed to be a standalone, one-of-a-kind. \nUnder the steerage of hip firm Yabu Pushelberg, the Roosevelt – rumoured to be haunted occasionally by Marilyn Monroe and Charlie Chaplin – now has a look that is much more bespoke and which harkens to its original Spanish colonial design notes. \nSubtle textures, beautiful leathers and soft, grey tones with persimmon-red accents feature throughout and there's a real sense of sumptuous comfort. \nThe Hotel Roosevelt's new look draws on its original Spanish colonial design. \nNewly glammed up she may be, but the hotel, which was home to the very first Oscars ceremony, is still home for many in Hollywood. \nThe Tropicana Cafe, Library Bar, the Spare Room bowling alley and other public spaces continue to be hives for entertainment industry heavyweights and wannabes. And the renowned Tropicana heated outdoor swimming pool, painted by acclaimed artist David Hockney, remains untouched. \nLike the hotel itself, it's designated a historic-cultural monument by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T05:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T01:12:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
