More Lucha Libre wrestles with expansion \n888, which in February rejected a takeover offer by William Hill, the UK’s biggest bookmaker by market capitalisation, said it hoped to combine the companies’ digital platforms and become one of the leading operators in the global online gaming industry with combined annual revenues of roughly $1.1bn. \nThe sector has seen a wave of consolidation over the past year. In June 2014 Amaya acquired PokerStars and Full Tilt for $4.9bn in cash, creating the world’s biggest listed online gaming group. \n“They made everyone realise that the industry was entering another phase,” Philip Yea, chairman of Bwin.party, said. “We viewed this as a period to explore consolidation while not losing sight of our core business.” \nThe enlarged group will have a strong position in sports betting, poker, casino and bingo, the companies said. 888 already provides the technology that powers Bwin.party’s online casino games. \nThe offer represents a premium of 16.4 per cent on Bwin.party’s share price on May 14, the day before the company announced discussions about a possible tie-up. Bwin.party has been exploring a sale since November and its shares have fallen 10.67 per cent this year. \nBwin.party investors can elect to accept varying amounts of 888 shares and cash for each of their Bwin.party shares, but the number of new 888 shares that will be issued will be fixed at about 341.6m. Bwin.party shareholders will own 48.9 per cent of the combined group. \nLast week GVC confirmed it had offered 110p a share in cash and stock for Bwin.party, which would have valued the company at £906m. Its bid consisted of 45 per cent cash and 55 per cent in new GVC shares. \nBwin.party said that while GVC’s proposal had attractive features it carried “additional execution risks”, without giving further details. \nThe deal included a break-up fee of £5.7m, which does not mean that the GVC bid is off the table yet, according to Morgan Stanley. \n“We think 888’s stock should be more attractive to Bwin shareholders given GVC’s higher mix of unregulated markets and 888’s larger potential for synergies,” analyst Matt Smith said. \nThe companies said they estimated cost savings achieved from the merger would amount to at least $70m per year before tax by the end of the 2018 financial year. \nThe fact that management is pinpointing 2018 as the year for savings, however, “demonstrates that integration will not be straight forward”, Peel Hunt said. \n888 will finance the cash part of the takeover through a $600m term loan credit facility, the company said. \nBwin.party’s shares were down 0.9 per cent at 102p while 888’s were up 3 per cent at 165p in early London trading. \nThe merged group would be likely to consider whether to make Bwin.party’s Studios B2B business a standalone entity and potentially spin it off into a separate listed vehicle, with shares being distributed to 888 shareholders, the announcement said. \nLiz Catchpole, a Bwin.party independent non-executive director, and Martin Weigold, the group’s chief financial officer, will join the 888 board as an independent non-executive director and a non-executive director. \nNorbert Teufelberger, Bwin.party’s chief executive, will provide consultancy services for the enlarged group’s sports-betting business.
