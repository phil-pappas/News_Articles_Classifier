But on 5 July, when a pair of climbers on Half Dome’s north-west face called their friend in the valley to say they were stuck below a missing ledge , word spread quickly through the tight-knit climbing community.\nNow the race is on to be the first to remap some of the most spectacular and influential routes across the new rock face in Yosemite.\nWhile the 1,500-meter cliff lost a section of rock about 60 meters high, that size of flake is by no means uncommon in the park, which is constantly being shaped by chips and boulders peeling off the 100m-year-old formations.\nIt might even seem puny relative to the largest such incident, at the Three Brothers rock formation, in 1987. Just down the valley from Half Dome, an unknown cause sent 600,000 cubic meters of rock barrelling through thick conifers and down across the Merced River. By contrast, the Half Dome flake left just about 800 cubic meters of talus at the cliff base.\nRockfall the scale of last week’s happens about once a year in Yosemite, presenting a constant potential hazard to visitors. In 2008, a massive rockfall below nearby Glacier Point forced the closing and relocation of 276 cabins at visitor outpost Curry Village.\nThis latest release is significant not because of its size but because of its location.\n“What makes it interesting is that it came right off one of the two most historic routes in Yosemite Valley,” says professional climber Cedar Wright, who worked for Yosemite Search and Rescue for five years and was the first to climb many of Yosemite’s most difficult routes. Only the Nose on El Capitan rivals in popularity and significance.\n A climber ascends what has been called the hardest rock climb in the world: a free climb of a El Capitan.

[And whoever does it] will get to put their name on that route,” says Wright, who is based in Boulder, Colorado, and last visited Yosemite in April. “I have to admit, for sure, I thought, maybe I should go out there and re-establish it.”\nWright is probably far from the only person to have that thought, considering that the route is popular and relatively accessible to non-experts.\n“Everybody is of the mindset that there is going to be a race to figure out this new link,” says Yosemite chief of staff Mike Gauthier, a strong climber himself. “I think it’s going to attract people who want to be a part of this historic line.”\n Half Dome in August 2011. Photograph: Tracie Cone/AP That race presents several potential hazards. Park rangers were able to reach the area just below the denuded rock face on Tuesday, and warned of loose rock where the flake broke free from the wall.\nDays of rain, which may have triggered the break, present a continued hazard, according to park geologist Greg Stock. Climbing routes in the valley always are at risk from falling rock, which he warns is nearly impossible to predict.\n“There are at least two other features that have fallen off on that route,” says Stock. “These cliffs are not static.”\nApart from physical hazards, climbing ranger Brandon Latham says re-establishing the route could threaten the character of the wall. The now smooth surface might well require a large number of bolts to be passable again. He says he has never seen anything like the damage done to such a recognizable feature.\n“Looking at it the other day, the section where the rock fell off is pretty blank,” says Latham, meaning a bolt ladder might have to be installed.\nA ladder would be substantially easier than what was there before. On the other hand, if a more ambitious climber were to reach the spot first, they might make the route substantially harder by placing bolts farther apart or along a more difficult line.\nGauthier says the rain is the only thing that’s keeping the route suspended in uncertainty. Otherwise, he says, motivated climbers would already be up there, scouting and re-establishing the line.\nThe park service leaves that work up to climbers, who are not allowed to use any sort of power tools to set bolts. It’s all done very slowly, by hand, taking anywhere from 20-45 minutes per bolt.\nAs a result, the shape of the route will be governed by whoever gets there first. “I think it’ll all depend on the talent of the climber who gets up there,” says Gauthier. “And I’d guess it’s going to be someone pretty motivated.”\nFor Wright’s part, he hopes that whoever gets there first designs it in keeping with what the route has been for many: a spectacular, moderate route that anybody with strength and basic ability can accomplish.\nAn unwritten set of rules govern the climbing code of conduct and dictate certain respect for the work of those who came before. “I really would like to go up there to try to re-establish the route,” says Latham. “But part of me is kind of holding back from that because … I don’t feel it’s my place to do it as a climbing ranger.”\nWright says the whole incident helps to put Yosemite climbing in perspective. Quite literally, nothing is set in stone.\n“Just by being at Yosemite, you’re at risk of being buried by rockfall,” says Wright. “Even something as seemingly permanent as a cliff face in geological time is eroding away like a dirt bank.”\nIn the meantime, regardless of who is first up the wall, there will probably be debate about whatever style is chosen for the new section of Half Dome.\n“Anyone who’s a fairly accomplished climber should be able to do that route, not just your most badass experts, I would hope,” says Wright. He adds that anything radical would be hugely controversial. “Us climbers love to get in ethical debates.”\nFor his part, Gauthier asks that whoever gets there first report back – and he warns climbers that failure to respect the route will be noticed. “Whatever climber does the workaround,” says Gauthier, “they should be mindful that the climbing community will be watching closely.”", "external_links": ["http://www.climbingyosemite.com/portfolio/half-dome-rockfall/", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Yosemite+rockfall+launches+high-stakes+race+to+re-map+Half+Dome+climb&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4ahcd%2Fstw%23img-3", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Yosemite+rockfall+launches+high-stakes+race+to+re-map+Half+Dome+climb&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4ahcd%2Fstw%23img-2", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4ahcd%2Fsfb%23img-2&ref=responsive", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4ahcd%2Fsfb%23img-3&ref=responsive", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Yosemite+rockfall+launches+high-stakes+race+to+re-map+Half+Dome+climb&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Fjul%2F10%2Fyosemite-half-dome-rock-climbing-rockfall&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F479f6837e0efad5b7f52f754d47840489c14e37e%2F174_65_953_1429%2F953.jpg", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Yosemite+rockfall+launches+high-stakes+race+to+re-map+Half+Dome+climb&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Fjul%2F10%2Fyosemite-half-dome-rock-climbing-rockfall&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F4aedb8d35ec258b4ded8a81c0d230e0965bfca44%2F0_0_3000_1800%2F3000.jpg", "http://www.supertopo.com/climbers-forum/2651396/Half-Dome-Rockfall"], "published": "2015-07-11T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T22:50:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
