Brown once proposed to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who liked the idea.\nBrown unveiled the specifics of the ad campaign to the media Monday, standing near a bus stop outside City Hall.\nThe bus stop was decorated with an ad encouraging travel to New York City. Also attending the news conference were representatives of Visit Buffalo Niagara, the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority and Lamar Advertising – all working with Buffalo on the advertising campaign.\nBrown said he got the idea for a New York City-Buffalo travel campaign after seeing a similar London-New York City promotion. The campaign, Brown said, is particularly attractive for Buffalo because New York City attracts tourists from throughout the world, who will be seeing the Buffalo ads all around New York City.\n“Wow! Can this be Buffalo?” reads one ad featuring a kayaker on Buffalo’s sunny waterfront.\nThe campaign is lasting about 10 weeks in each city, according to NFTA spokesman C. Douglas Hartmayer.\n“We’re thrilled to partner with New York City,” Brown said.\nemail: sschulman@buffnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T04:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T08:47:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
