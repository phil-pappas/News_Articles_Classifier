He imagined how spectacular the views would be from the headland and made it his mission to establish a community on the then-inaccessible site. The six-bedroom Casa Las Gemelas (from $4,000 nightly) was just the third house of its kind built in Costa Careyes. Erected in 1975 on 2.5 acres—one of the gated community’s largest lots—the peach-colored, cliffside castle captures its founder’s vision. The main open-air living and dining areas sit beneath towering palapa -style roofs and open onto expansive terraces with panoramic ocean views. An infinity-edge swimming pool seemingly hangs on to the precipice, while a more precarious 12-person hot tub is magically perched just above the crashing waves. \nThe current owners purchased the home in 2003, adding an alfresco rooftop cinema, expanding the gardens at the back of the lot to better accommodate weddings and large parties, and installing new plumbing and electronics systems. Now, for the first time in 12 years, the owners have made the home available to renters. Prior to 2003, the home’s staff (who has been with Las Gemelas since it opened) has hosted Claudia Schiffer, Oprah Winfrey, Tom Ford, Steve Martin, and other recognizable names. With the home back on the rental market, Casa Las Gemelas looks forward to welcoming its next generation of VIP guests.
