The site connects activity, tour and gear providers with consumers, but from the traveler’s perspective it’s loaded with getaway ideas for city lovers as well as those who prefer guided tours or small-group activities. Check out the “Journal” section for travel tips and the “Gear” section for clothing and other items you might want to pack for your trip. I was especially drawn to the collections in the “Recommended” sections, a worthy blend of gear and trips. As a special bonus, you’ll find many activi- ties on sale at significant markdowns.\n>> What’s not: It might have been a fluke, but when I clicked on the “Clear All” button, I still got search results for a city I had previously selected. Small potatoes.\nJen Leo, Los Angeles Times\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T19:59:03.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
