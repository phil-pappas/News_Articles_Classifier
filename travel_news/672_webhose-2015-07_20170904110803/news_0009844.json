TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \n\"We rate TRIPADVISOR INC (TRIP) a BUY. This is driven by a number of strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its robust revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, expanding profit margins and notable return on equity. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had lackluster performance in the stock itself.\" \nYou can view the full analysis from the report here: TRIP Ratings Report", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T17:38:00.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
