Rowen said that he would never confront customers in an angry manner and that most of them completely understood while others complained to the manager.\nStarbucks \"Instead of the manager supporting me ... instead of saying... 'I'm not going to take your order until you move your car,' she [the manager] would take care of them [the customers] and then tell me to leave them alone,\" he said.\nRowen said that after three months of this happening, the manager finally said he couldn’t visit the coffee shop anymore. \"'I don't want you harassing my customers. I don't want you to come back in this store ever,’” he said the manager told him.\nAfter the confrontation with the manager, Rowen said that he “left (the situation) alone,” but received a letter on Thursday that said he was not allowed in any Starbucks location. In the letter, the company said that he was expelled for “causing a disruption to business” and “threatening the well-being of a customer or partner (employee).”\nWhile the issue stems from his interactions with the manager, Rowen said that he is friendly with the baristas and most of them agree with his confrontations with customers who park in handicap spots. 'I'm so sorry, this is on me. Thank you for what you do,’” Rowen said the baristas tell him. He added that he feels compelled to defend this issue since his son-in-law has muscular dystrophy and uses a power wheelchair.\nRowen told ABC News he would not dispute the ban, but a regional executive discussed the issue with Rowen and has agreed to reinstate him.\nRead more at ABC News .\n</span", "external_links": ["http://abcnews.go.com/US/starbucks-revokes-ban-man-asked-patrons-park-disability/story?id=32683177", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/07/27/c7/e6/starbucks.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-27T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:34:01.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
