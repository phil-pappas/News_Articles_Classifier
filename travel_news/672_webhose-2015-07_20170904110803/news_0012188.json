Lapine called Sondheim’s conversation with Lear “time well-spent,” an inspiration for Into the Woods.\nLapine said he wrote an “endless” opening scene–featuring characters from the Brothers Grimm fairy tales “Little Red Riding Hood,” “Jack and the Beanstalk” and “Cinderella”—and gave it Sondheim, “not knowing how he’d musicalize this. He took it, and, boom. . . After the opening number, we could ride with it.”\nSondheim said he tried to get into “the playwright’s mind. I do exactly what the actor does, I look at the dialogue and delve as deeply as I can.”\nJoanna Gleason, who portrayed the baker’s wife and won Tony and other awards for her performance, said that she felt confused by her character’s seduction by Cinderella’s prince, telling Sondheim she felt like she was in the “wrong story.” Sondheim said this was the only time in his life he took lyrics from an actor (in “Any Moment,” the baker’s wife sings to the prince, ”What am I doing here? I’m in the wrong story.“)\nLapine mentioned that Kim Crosby, Cinderella in the original production, had winning America’s Junior Miss pageant on her resume. “This woman was for real, she has a purity and innocence, she’s from Missouri,” he explained, adding that Patti Lupone, not known for these virtues, also auditioned for the role.\nSimilarly, Lapine said he saw Ben Wright—who originated the role of Jack—“sitting with a big smile on his face. He had this Midwestern thing, innocence and purity, an innocence in his voice.”\nThe creators and members of the original cast of the Broadway musical, “Into the Woods,” reunited recently at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. (Richard Termine)\nBernadette Peters, the witch in the original production, and a star, with Mandy Patinkin, in Lapine’s and Sondheim’s earlier musical, Sunday in the Park with George , called working on the musical with Patinkin “a great experience about learning about life.” She said she felt there would be more “life lessons” from Into the Woods, adding that she wanted to “learn, because Steve writes music and lyrics that are able to say what he wants to say.”\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T07:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T06:31:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
