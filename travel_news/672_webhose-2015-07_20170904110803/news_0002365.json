Jefferson City, MO - infoZine - Drivers on Missouri's interstates and major highways drive past one of 250 digital signs each day. The Missouri Department of Transportation posts safety messages on these signs. From mid-May to mid-June, more than 830 people voted on their favorite message out of a list of 16 messages used on Missouri’s signs. The top three messages to receive votes are: Pass on Left, Drive on Right Put Down Your Phone and Drive Turn Signals The Original Instant Message Photo courtesy of MoDOT / Facebook The primary purpose of the dynamic message signs is to convey critical information to motorists about lane closures or complete road closures. When the roads are clear of incidents, the signs convey safety messages to get motorists’ attention. Each month MoDOT staff develops a set of messages related to certain themes suited for a particular month or time of year. For example, July includes a DWI enforcement effort by the Missouri State Highway Patrol as well as heavy summer vacation travel and hot temperatures. Messages during July are focused on not drinking and driving, buckling up, proper use of the passing lane and reminders not to leave kids in hot cars. The message themes change each month. Missourians are invited to continue to submit their ideas for new messages. The space on the sign is limited to three lanes with 16 spaces on each line. Message topics and ideas can be emailed to MoDOT at .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T16:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T19:58:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
