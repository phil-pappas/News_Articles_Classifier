As French star of the American War of Independence and France’s own revolution, the marquis was a dispute waiting to happen. And we were in his château at Chavaniac-Lafayette, near Le Puy. Lafayette was born there in 1757. You can’t miss it. It flies both the US and French flags and is now a eulogy to the wonderfulness of this “hero of two worlds”. “A very great man,” said my female companion who is, first, French and, second, my wife. “Napoleon called him a 'simpleton’,” I said. “A 'simpleton’ who beat the British all-ends-up,” she said. • Why France is better than Britain She was referring to Lafayette’s key role in the 1781 battle of Yorktown, the Franco-American victory that lead ultimately to US independence. “So Lafayette was responsible for the USA,” she cried. And, once again, it became clear how remarkable is the republican love-fest that blossoms whenever France and the US make common cause, especially if the British lurk as the bad guys. Of course, there are hiccups. But they are just hiccups. Last week’s claim that the US had eavesdropped recent French presidents will, I’m sure, prove to be simply one more. Everyone spies on everyone else, and always has. The only surprise is that anyone is surprised. President Hollande had to be outraged – that’s the form, too – but he has allegedly benefited from US intelligence in the past, and will doubtless do so again. Things will almost certainly be back to normal by US Independence Day. So the annual ceremony, which sees the US ambassador to France genuflecting before Lafayette’s grave in the Picpus Cemetery in Paris, shouldn’t be troubled. • France: the birthplace of binge-drinking Meanwhile, the Hermione – an £18 million French recreation of the frigate that took Lafayette across the Atlantic in 1780 – will headline a sail-by salute of the Statue of Liberty on Saturday. She has been creating a heroic stir wherever she shows up on the American eastern seaboard, with re-enactments galore. This is not surprising. Like men everywhere, Americans love dressing up in period uniforms, shouldering muskets and marching about. (As seen recently at the Waterloo bicentenary, it’s all the masculine fun of war with none of the inconveniences – amputation, gangrene, death.) Lafayette’s role in the US rebellion was of greater importance than is generally realised in Europe. Americans know all about him: there are dozens of places called Lafayette, Fayette, Fayetteville or similar across their nation. In Europe, it’s more vague. French people shrug. They’ve heard the name and think perhaps the fellow founded a chain of department stores. (Galéries Lafayettes are called thus because the first outlet was on Rue Lafayette, not because the marquis was also a shopkeeper.) This forgetfulness is unpardonable. Lafayette was a dashing figure, and important in himself. But his real significance was in helping to get French backing for the American rebels, a war-changing development. Orphaned young, Lafayette was among France’s richest aristocrats. Imbued with Enlightenment ideals, the American revolt could not but stir him. “My heart was dedicated,” he wrote. By 1780, he had already been to the rebellious colony, been adopted as a semi-son by George Washington and been wounded at Brandywine (soil from where now covers his tomb in Paris). Returning to France, he was instrumental in persuading the French government to recognise the US and to declare war on Britain. Then he recrossed the Atlantic – in the Hermione this time – to rejoin the fight. Meanwhile, a 6,000-strong French expeditionary force sailed for Rhode Island, and the French navy bobbed into action. If Lafayette’s motives remained idealistic, the French government’s were inspired more by revenge for their recent drubbing in the Seven Years’ War. • What do the French really think of us? Whatever the motives, everything came together at Yorktown, where British forces under Cornwallis were holed up. The French fleet blockaded the bay. French and American troops arrived from the north. Lafayette was already there, heading a Virginian force he paid and equipped with his own cash. Cornwallis surrendered on October 19 1781. Lafayette was the poster boy of the Franco-American love-fest, and remained so as the 1789 French revolution turned furious and almost consumed him, along with other moderates. But he survived, returning to the US in 1824 to a rock-star reception. • How the British invented France Thus when, almost a century later in 1917, the US expeditionary force showed up for the Great War, it was styled by many Americans as their repayment of a debt to the marquis. “Lafayette, we are here,” said senior US officer Charles Stanton before Lafayette’s tomb on July 4 1917. So began the tradition perpetuated this week by US ambassador Jane Hartley. Like all love-fests, this one has its complexities. During the Second World War, US leaders neither trusted nor liked General de Gaulle. He reciprocated. (“I have a feeling this will end badly,” he said, on first seeing California.) And, though both talk ceaselessly of liberty, they are often on different wavelengths. The French really don’t grasp freedom as in free trade, free enterprise, the freedom to make sack-loads of money and glory in it, the freedom to be a creationist or gun owner. Or to invade annoying countries. Or to spy on friends. • Tips for the French: learn how to drive and be less pretentious The French consider they exist on a higher plane, not driven by money or easy entertainment. They perceive the US as a big dog wagging its tail in a small room. It makes them feel good about themselves. Then they go to McDonald’s, watch Game of Thrones, make Disneyland in Paris the country’s No 1 visitor attraction, worship Woody Allen, award the Légion-d’Honneur to Bob Dylan and Jerry Lewis, and boost Fast and Furious 7 to the top of the 2015 box office. Oh, and they look to the US to save the world on those occasions when France deems it appropriate. As so often with the French, one must attend to what they do, rather than what they say; the gap between public discourse and actual behaviour yawns wide. On that basis, and aside from a few irreducible commies, the French continue to get on with the US. They just hate admitting it. Today they should, but won’t, man up on the subject. My wife did years ago. God bless America.
