Source: AFP \nAIRLINES are struggling to manage the growing throng of Aussies stranded in Bali after another day of flight cancellations due to a troublesome volcanic ash cloud. \nNgurah Rai International Airport was closed for another six hours today when winds again blew ash over Denpasar from the erupting Mount Raung.

Pic: Salman Al-Farizi Source: Supplied \nThe early morning change meant regular and additional services planned by Virgin Australia and Jetstar had to be scratched, resulting in the axing of 26 flights to and from Bali. \nPerth’s Des Jhones had arrived at Ngurah Rai with his family when they were given the news they would not be going home. \nHe said others in the Jetstar queue had been stranded for four to five days already. \n“It’s frustrating but it’s no-one’s fault because it is a volcanic eruption so you can’t do anything about it,” Mr Jhones said. \n“I would like to go home today but I don’t think it is going to happen.” \nA number of the growing backlog of passengers took to Facebook and Twitter to vent their frustration with the situation and a perceived lack of communication from airlines. @richardbranson terrible customer service from #virginaustralia during this Bali volcano drama.

Checked in to our 3rd hotel in #Bali . No news of our departure flight. #volcano #ashcloud — Zubin Nalawalla (@zubinnalawalla) July 11, 2015 The service from @JetstarAirways in relation to my Bali flights has been nothing short of terrible! #Jetstar #crapservice — Krista Franklin (@KristaSFranklin) July 10, 2015 #jetstar You will be held accountable. There are 100's-perhaps 1000's-like me who slept on the airport floor last night. Ur staff dont care. \nSydney resident Bridget Candy urged Jetstar to employ more customer service staff in Australia “instead of routing everything to an offshore centre that don’t know what they are talking about”. \n“Your handling of this situation is appalling,” she wrote on Jetstar’s Facebook page. \nMichelle Baumann of Sydney posted “Jetstar where are your staff?” and James Lepre claimed to have spent “12-hours on the phone trying to find out when we can get a flight out of the country”. \nCentral Queensland’s Shelly Pringle said she was told 1500 other Aussies were waiting for flights ahead of her. \nVirgin Australia also came in for criticism for rebooking passengers in the week starting July 20. \n“An additional 10 days here is unacceptable with work commitments and school starting next week,” wrote Candi Chung on the airline’s Facebook site. \n“Your help desk staff do not know anything of use.” Ha! Love hearing ppl in local restaurant complain about being stuck here since thurs! Long timer here, stuck since the 4th #virginaustralia — Amy (@Amyiadarola) July 10, 2015 \nSenior Meteorologist at the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre, Rebecca Patrick, said fluctuating conditions were making it difficult to provide any certainty to airlines operating out of Bali. \nShe said it was possible north-westerly winds would move closer to the north overnight, blowing the ash plume away from Denpasar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T13:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T14:12:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
