Adv: There is a dark side to tourism in Dubai - watch out! Adv: \nTravel and Tourism to Dubai has been an artificial but futuristic visitor's experience for tourists arriving on the Airbus A380 on Dubai's home airline Emirates from every corner of the globe. The average spending per tourist is in the range other destinations could only dream of. Hundred thousands of foreigners and some of the most luxurious hotels in the world - this is Dubai. \nEven three star hotels give a 5 star experience compared to a hotel experience in countries like the USA. Dubai means: Luxury hotels with services unheard of in the rest of the world. A vacation becomes magical and an eyeopener in this desert town. \nDubai is the fastest growing city in the world and is a dazzling, cosmopolitan destination complete with gleaming skyscrapers, amazing weather. In the late 1960s, it was simply a pile of sand with only one large building built upon it and a dozen cars circulating the land. \nDubai is a world of the future. It's why it is a magnet for tourists and business travelers from all over the world. \nDue to the city being ruled under strict Muslim law by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Dubai virtually has a 0% crime rate. In a city inhabited primarily by foreigners, people know that they can easily be imprisoned or deported for the slightest of criminal acts, making Dubai one of the safest cities on the planet. The Sheikh takes great pride in Dubai’s police force and makes a conscious effort to show off how classy it is to tourists coming to visit. As a result, each police car in Dubai costs as much as sending one person to college in the United States. The various models of police cars include Ferraris (valued at $500,000), Lamborghinis (valued at $400,000) and one Ashton Martin, priced at $1.79 million. \n85% of the population in Dubai are foreigners. Visitors from all over the world often mistake what is presented to them . \nTourists had been arrested for premarital sex. It's illegal in Dubai and can get you imprisoned or deported. Public displays of affection are very much frowned upon in the Muslim country and it is advised not even to hold hands with your significant other in public – let alone kiss. \nOf course, the government can’t control what happens behind closed doors, and in that regard many foreigners and Emiratis do whatever they’d like. There have however been instances of expats being jailed after it was discovered that they had engaged in intimate acts with anybody other than their spouse. Sadly, more often than not, it’s the man’s word against the woman’s. Several foreign women in recent years have been imprisoned after bringing it to authorities’ attention that they were raped. \nIn 2011 a British tourist was beaten to death by officers in a Dubai police station after being arrested for swearing. \nKnowing local customs, and following the rules will make a holiday in Dubai a success. \nA picture profile of Dubai of a different sort can speak a thousand words: Guys texting and driving with their pets. Strange cats hanging out of windows. People getting taken for walks by their pets. Pets getting exotic snacks. Smart solutions to traffic jams. Pets on boats. Car park attendants you don’t want to mess with. Backseat drivers you back away from. Bikes with a serious amount of horsepower. Lamborghini cop cars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T22:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T02:58:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
