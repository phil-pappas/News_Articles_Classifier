It’s the best ten days of winter. There’s mountain biking, road biking, marathon, half marathon, food festivities and fun for the kids. It’s a ten-day family event embracing oysters and embracing the town but it’s not just about eating oysters, it’s the best place to be.”\nLocal restaurateur, Charles van Tonder, says he is concerned about the sustainability of the oyster trade.\n“What would really be of great value is if the marine coastal management were to do a survey of our coast. We could then establish how many oysters there are, where they are, where their concentrations are, where we should be harvesting them and really come up with a scientific management plan.”\nEach year the South African Navy makes a grand entrance at this event by navigating some of their vessels through the treacherous Knysna Heads and remain in the town for the duration of the festival.\nRelated Posts Chelsea Football Club Hosts Leaders Sport Summit 2013, the world’s most Prestigious Sport Business Summit South African Airways (SAA) has embarked upon a sustainable aviation fuel program South Africa’s new tourism campaign covers significant Indian cities Road accidents costing South Africa billions of rands per year Escaped lion recaptured, sent to South Africa’s Karoo National Park", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T22:52:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
