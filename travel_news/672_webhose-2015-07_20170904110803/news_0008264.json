Photo: REUTERS \n\"We want to promote the fact that volcanoes don't always mean danger,\" Wijaya said. \n\"Actually, we can enjoy volcanoes in several places. \n\"Indonesia is a more exotic place because of its volcanoes.\" \nWhile the drama dented the budgets of tourists, the loss to Bali's economy will be enormous. \nNgurah Rai Airport - which was forced to close down entirely on some days due to the ash - usually sees around 10,000 daily arrivals during the peak season. \nOn average, visitors to Bali spend $US150 (NZ$228) per day. \nVOLCANO TOURISM IN INDONESIA: \n* Mount Bromo (East Java) - The Bromo-Tengger-Semeru national park is famous for its moon-like landscape and two very lively volcanoes, Bromo and Semeru. \n* Tangkuban Perahu (West Java) - Since its last eruption in 1983 it has become a popular tourist site where you can boil eggs in the hot springs. \n* Mount Batur (Bali) - The easy two-hour climb to the summit of this still active volcano is becoming a popular way for visitors to Bali's interior to see the sunrise. - AAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T01:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T05:45:43.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
