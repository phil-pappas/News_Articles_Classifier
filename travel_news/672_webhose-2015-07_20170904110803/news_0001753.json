The gunman was shot dead. Three people were injured, including a police officer and a Marine Corps recruiter. \nThe FBI named the suspect as Mohammod Youssuf Abdulazeez, 24, but said it was too early to speculate on a motive for the rampage, which comes at a time when U.S. military and law enforcement authorities are increasingly concerned about the threat posed by 'lone wolves' to domestic targets. \n\"We are treating this as an act of domestic terrorism,\" Bill Killian, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Tennessee, said earlier, adding that no official determination of the nature of the crime had yet been made and the Federal Bureau of Investigation has not ruled anything out. \n\"While it would be premature to speculate on the motives of the shooter at this time, we will conduct a thorough investigation of this tragedy and provide updates as they are available,\" the agency said in a statement. \nThe incident served as an ugly reminder of other deadly shootings at US military installations, including a 2009 rampage at Fort Hood that left 13 dead and a 2013 attack at the Navy Yard in Washington that left 12 dead. \nNBC reported that Mohammod Youssuf Abdulazeez was a naturalized American born in Kuwait. \nU.S. officials said law enforcement authorities are investigating whether he was inspired by Islamic State or a similar militant group. \nPresident Barack Obama offered his condolences to the victims' families and said officials will be prompt and thorough in getting answers on the shootings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T01:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T02:01:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
