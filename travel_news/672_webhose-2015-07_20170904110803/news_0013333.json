I Love You’ may well soon change to ‘P.S. Will You Marry Me’ with local businesses and Destination Port Stephens chasing a boost in the high-yield weddings market for the region.\nWhile Port Stephens, with its pristine beaches and blue, dolphin-filled bays, already hosts many weddings for Cupid-struck couples from outside the region, a local business action group has been formed to encourage more couples from around Australia to tie the knot in Port Stephens.\nLocal florists, make-up artists, hire car companies, spa sanctuaries, hotels, resorts, clubs, function venues, cruise and tour operators, stationery businesses, entertainers and event organisers are all invited to attend a business meeting at The Anchorage Port Stephens at 10am on Monday, August 10, 2015, to work out ways the region can attract more weddings.\nMoves to boost the local weddings market and its economic benefits for the local region are supported by Destination Port Stephens which says there is great potential in positioning Port Stephens across Australia as a romantic and beautiful destination in which to get married.\n“Port Stephens already hosts many weddings involving couples from Sydney, Melbourne and elsewhere but the potential for the market to be a lot bigger is great so we are supporting this industry push to attract more wedding groups to the region,” said Destination Port Stephens CEO, Janelle Gardner.\n“We hope anyone who facilitates weddings, receptions and bucks and hens parties can come to this important first meeting on August 10 so we can grow this important source of income and employment for our region,” Ms Gardner said. “Florists, make-up artists and stationery companies may not think they play role in the tourism industry but they form part of the weddings sectors which is a high-yield segment of the tourism industry so their involvement is crucial.\n“Of course the weddings market is a perfect fit with our local tourism slogan, ‘P.S. I Love You’ but we know Port Stephens offers couples a romantic and idyllic backdrop for the biggest day of their lives. With the support of more businesses, we hope more couples will tie the knot here soon.”\nSource:-Port Stephens", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:58:14.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
