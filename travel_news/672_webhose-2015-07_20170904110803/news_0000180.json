It's exciting.\"\nThe 1.2-million-square-foot park has two anchor tenants, Northrop Grumman and General Atomics, both of which are major defence contractors. General Atomics also signed a tentative agreement earlier this week to establish an unmanned aerial systems training academy at Grand Sky and is negotiating details of the lease.\n\"The word tentative, I think, is in relation to what exactly are the businesses that General Atomics will be conducting here, not whether they're coming to Grand Forks,\" Swoyer said.\nNorthrop Grumman and General Atomics will each have separate buildings in the park, which will have the look and feel of a campus, Swoyer said.\n\"Think of it like a neighbourhood with different land plots,\" he said. \"Northrop Grumman wanted the model home right in front and General Atomics wants one a little farther in.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T22:09:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
