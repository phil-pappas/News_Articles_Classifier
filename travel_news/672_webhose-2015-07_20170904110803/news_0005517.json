The Ashdown Academy programme sees WRG engaging future talent for the company’s London office. The WRG team supports students on the Chartered Institute of Marketing accredited event management course with classroom tuition, guest lectures and on the job training. \nThe scheme is designed to give students that all-important boost to their career with a tailored three-month work placement. Drawing on WRG’s global client base, valuable work experience will be gained with high profile brands and industry leaders in sectors such as telecoms and technology, healthcare and financial services. This is the second academic partnership that WRG has struck. The company already has a long-established relationship with Manchester Metropolitan University. Nadisha Jayatissa, 26, is the first student to take up a three-month work placement at WRG’s London office. She starts today (20th July). Nadisha was selected because she impressed all at WRG with her hard work, passion and dedication. Nadisha brought a case study to life with both creativity and practicality within a strictly regulated corporate environment. Nadisha will be supporting the team across a number of clients and projects. Nadisha Jayatissa said: “I am hugely excited about my placement with WRG. During my time at Ashdown Academy, WRG was one of the most talked-about companies, so to actually get the opportunity to work with the team is something I’m very much looking forward to.” Rob Bagust, Head of Congress at WRG said: “We feel it’s incredibly important to encourage and support the next generation of event professionals. With our global brand portfolio, this is a unique opportunity for WRG to be part of the start of someone's career and we look forward to bringing new talent and a fresh perspective into the business.” Justine Kane, Course Director at Ashdown Academy said: “Businesses are key to the future of postgraduate education and our partnership with WRG means we can offer our students real-life work experience to support their classroom tuition to launch their career in the events industry.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T18:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T00:27:21.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
