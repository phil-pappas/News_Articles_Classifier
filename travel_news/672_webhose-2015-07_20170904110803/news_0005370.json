The Tico Times \nA 151-room hotel with restaurants, bar and lounge, infinity pool, spa and convention center is the latest tourism development planned for the Pacific province of Guanacaste. Itâ€™s a project of Desarrollos Hoteleros Guanacaste, a subsidiary of local corporation Florida Ice and Farm ( FIFCO ). \nThe group announced this week that the new W hotel complex Reserva Conchal Costa Rica has a projected opening date for the second quarter of 2019. The project will be operated by the U.S. company Starwood Hotels & Resorts , FIFCO reported in a press release. \nThe resort will be located in Cabo Velas, Santa Cruz, some 45 minutes from the Daniel Oduber International Airport in Liberia. \nThe project includes the construction of a desalination plant to supply the new hotel with fresh water. \nBusinesses and residents in Guanacaste have faced drought conditions in recent years, causing losses in the agriculture and livestock industry . \nDespite water supply problems, the tourism industry in Guanacaste has seen a boom. FIFCO currently owns another hotel at Reserva Conchal, the Westin Golf Resort & Spa Playa Conchal, also operated by Starwood since 2011. \nInternational hotel chains plan to open a number of new hotels in the area in the coming years, including Paradisus Papagayo Bay Resort, Marriott Papagayo and the Wyndham Papagayo YU Resort.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T13:03:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
