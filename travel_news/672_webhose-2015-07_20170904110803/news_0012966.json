So to understand what it might be like to live in a super safe place, we sought out residents living in some of the most stable and secure cities in the world, as ranked by The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). The list considered factors such as personal safety, infrastructure stability, health stability and digital security technology. Locals weighed in on the best neighbourhoods to live in, what exactly makes them feel at ease – and why safe doesn’t have to equal boring. \nOsaka Along with Tokyo (named the world’s safest city), Osaka embodies the general peace of mind that can be felt throughout the country. “Japan in general is an incredibly safe country to live in,” said Daniel Lee, founder of the local English language Kansai Scene magazine , who moved from the United Kingdom 17 years ago. “So much so that locals are accustomed to leaving their personal belongings unattended on tables in coffee shops while they go and order. It’s unthinkable anywhere else.” View image of Osaka's cherry blossoms in full bloom (Credit: Credit: Buddhika Weerasinghe/Getty) \nOsaka is known for being business-focussed, which means that people work and commute late into the night. “Even at the latest hours, businessmen are on the train, and the main terminals are populated as much at night as by day,” said Yoshie Yamamoto, who moved from Kyoto 25 years ago and runs the oldest Noh theatre in the city . “There is absolutely no problem for a lady to be travelling alone late at night on the subways.” \nThe work-oriented culture can also lead to friendly conversation. “Osaka is a city of salesmen, and the locals love to talk,” Lee said. “You can enter any small watering hole and be treated like a long lost friend. You may not understand a word of what they say to you, but the good vibes will win you over.” View image of A rice planting ritual in Osaka (Credit: Credit: Buddhika Weerasinghe/Getty) \nFor a chance to mingle with the locals, Yamamoto recommends living in a downtown area such as Ikuno Ward or Abeno Ward, where Nagaya (traditional long houses) are still common. “These places are relatively cheap as they have been inhabited by the same locals [for years],” she said. “If you are able to make friends with your neighbours, you will experience the true Osaka character filled with affection, warmth and friendship.” \nThose looking for a more nature-focused lifestyle can head to the “bed towns” surrounding the city, such as Minoh and Kita-Senri, which have easy train access to downtown Osaka, as well as the nearby cities of Kobe and Kyoto. \nAmsterdam With fewer than one million residents, Amsterdam is still relatively small compared to other cities on the EIU’s list, giving it a leg up when it comes to providing a safe residential environment. The capital city also has a laidback vibe that puts people at ease.

Nobody gets agitated easily.” This is true even of the police, who Hinterstoisser says are very present and polite, but also straight to the point.

To the east and north, neighbourhoods like Noord are considered to be up-and-coming. Hinterstoisser lives in Oud West (Old West), which he likes for being only 2km west of the city centre and near Vondelpark , the city’s largest park.

Another favoured option is Surry Hills, 3km southeast of the centre, which has the best coffee spots and restaurants in town, drawing hipsters, design lovers and foodies. \nFor a true Australian beach lifestyle, residential-oriented Waverley or surfer-friendly Bronte are about 8km southeast of the city, while Rose Bay is an upscale harbourside option just 7km to the east. \nSingapore This Southeast Asian city-state takes law enforcement seriously, resulting in a very secure environment. Rinita Vanjre Ravi, originally from Bangalore, and co-founder of dine-with-locals site BonAppetour , sees how much difference a well-funded police department can make. “In Singapore, the police force is well paid, which enables them to be concerned about the welfare of their people,” she said.

Vanjre Ravi finds that Singapore locals are really honest. “You can leave your bag at the table at any restaurant and go to the cashier to order food with the peace of mind that your bag will still be there,” she said. “Residents know that there is a high chance of being caught and punished.” \nA stable political environment and a no-tolerance policy for religious or racist jokes also contributes to a harmonic city vibe.

Managing the daily commute is key when finding a place to live in Singapore, and locals advise living as close to work as possible. Vanjre Ravi recommends Tiong Bahru as a central hipster neighbourhood with specialty shops and trendy restaurants, though those in a higher income bracket can look at the Duxton Hill apartments near Outram Park, 2km west of downtown, notable for its restored colonial buildings and international cuisine.

Stockholm’s natural light in summer, paired with a well-lit city centre in darker times of the year, contributes to a feeling of safe public spaces. “Having two small boys, safety is increasingly important to me, and Stockholm is simply brilliant for children,” said Kat T, originally from London, who writes the blog An English Mamma in Stockholm . “There are playgrounds in parks away from the traffic and many leafy, green areas right in the centre of town.” View image of Cyclists in downtown Stockholm (Credit: Credit: Olivier Morin/Getty) \nThough it doesn’t have the non-stop buzz of London, Kat finds that Stockholm’s slower pace can sometimes be a blessing. Despite its small size, the city also feels “dynamic and sophisticated”, she said. “Swedes are early adopters of things new, especially technology, and are frequently trendsetters.” View image of A Color Run in Stockholm (Credit: Credit: Jonathan Nackstrand/Getty) \nMost people live in apartments close to the Central Business District, but those looking for better value should head 2km west to Kungsholmen, while a funkier vibe (evidenced in vintage shops and avant-garde galleries) can be found in Södermalm 3km to the south. The waterfront areas have also been recently redeveloped, with Hammarby Sjöstad being among the most popular for its walkable boulevards and eco-conscious design. \nWhere do you rank in our tribe of worldly readers?
