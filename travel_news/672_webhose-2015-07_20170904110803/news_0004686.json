Located in a cosy converted house built at the height of the gold rush in the 1850s, there is an emphasis on fresh, local produce, with the menu changing depending on what back door suppliers turn up with and what’s growing in the restaurant’s garden at the time. Chef Anthony and his wife Hope have introduced a degustation menu, which incorporates local products, such as Beechworth Honey and Bright Chocolate.\nIn the nearby King Valley, Otto Dal Zotto was the first person to grow prosecco commercially in 1999. His sons, winemaker Michael and marketing manager Christian, joined the business, which is now one of around a dozen producers of the popular Italian varietal in an area which has become known as Prosecco Road. Mum Elena grows olives, tomato, garlic and other vegetables and herbs on the property, which are served in the winery’s restaurant. Lambs are also bred there for food, and graze alongside white cockatoos in front of the vineyards, while guests play bocce. A few times a year, Otto roasts a pig on the spit.\nChristian and Otto Dal Zotto playing bocce at Dal Zotto Wines.

Katrina also runs a cooking school on site, which recently featured on MasterChef, with twice-weekly classes teaching students how to make apple strudel and pasta. The family connection also runs deep at Brown Brothers Wine, half an hour’s drive away at Milawa. But it’s more the girls moving into the business these days. “We joke it should be renamed Brown Sisters,” fourth-generation winemaker Katherine Brown says. She shows us the recently renovated barn, built by her great-great-grandfather in the 1860s, where her great-grandfather made his first wine. The family now works with the CSIRO to create new varieties that suit the Australian environment.\nTastings are held in the wine cellar, filled with shelves lined with thousands of dusty bottles, dating as far back as 1956. The Browns also started food and wine pairings in their restaurant before it was fashionable in the 1980s. Today, the menu includes a tender oyster blade steak with beef cheek croquettes from Albury, served with pumpkin from the back garden; chicken liver pate and free range local quail. The family-friendly winery also has a children’s playground and giant outdoor chess to keep the littlies entertained.\nKatherine Brown (left) and her sister Caroline Brown from Brown Brothers Winery in Milawa.

The couple established the business, housed in a century-old butter factory, in 1988 after travelling throughout Europe, offering subtle, light flavours which weren’t in the Australian market at the time. It sells 20 types of cheese made from cow and goat’s milk. The cafe also incorporates cheese with menu items such as pizza, spinach cheese souffle and arancini (stuffed rice balls).\nIf you prefer sweet to savoury, head to Bright Chocolate Factory and Cafe, which produces small batches of chocolate using cacao beans from Ecuador, Madagascar, the Dominican Republic and Trinidad with no artificial flavouring. At Beechworth Honey, owned by fourth generation beekeepers Jodie and Steve Goldsworthy, you can taste 30 varieties named after their floral source, including Red Gum, Yellow Box and Lemon Myrtle. At Beechworth Honey Discovery, which opened last December, you can eat dishes rated on their dependence on a honeybee for the pollination of the ingredients used. They include pumpkin falafel, goat’s cheese and zucchini souffle.\nMore recently Asian flavours have also developed in the high country, with owner-chef Michael Ryan’s passion for Japan apparent in his degustation dinner at Provenance restaurant in the former Bank of Australasia building across the road. Ryan hosts biannual tours to Japan, where he met his Japanese chef Yasu Tokuda.\nThe writer was a guest of Tourism Victoria.\nFollow Angela Saurine on Twitter: @angela_saurine\nGo2 VICTORIA’S HIGH COUNTRY\nGETTING THERE\nBeechworth is a three-hour drive north of Melbourne and 6.5 hours from Sydney.\nSTAYING THERE\nOvens Valley Motor Inn, Great Alpine Rd, Bright; from $139 per night twin share, 5755 2022, ovensvalleymotorinncom.au\nFreeman on Ford, 97 Ford St, Beechworth; single rooms from $255 per night midweek, twin share from $275 per night.
