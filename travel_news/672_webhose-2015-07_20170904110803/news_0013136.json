There's so many people who worked so hard to get us to this point, and I'm grateful for their perseverance.\" Economic development experts believe the World Heritage Site designation means that hundreds of thousands more tourists will visit San Antonio over the next 10 years. Taylor said businesses and local leaders are already working to prepare the city for those new visitors. San Antonio Convention & Visitors Bureau Executive Director Casandra Matej , who was also at the celebration, said an international marketing campaign will now begin. \"The next step for us is to tell the world about the designation,\" Matej said. \"This is a great opportunity for us to further attract international visitors to San Antonio, and it really puts us on the world stage.\" Matej said an intense digital campaign will run from July through October in Germany and other European nations, as well as Mexico, Latin America and Canada. The Convention & Visitors Bureau is working with Austin-based Proof Advertising to get the word out. It has also contracted with international public relations firm Leib to handle publicity in Germany and the United Kingdom. \"We're already in Germany now doing media events to spread the word,\" Matej said. \"We know that the international visitors know about the World Heritage Site designation and what that means. They are the first point of contact to bring to San Antonio.\" \nWant San Antonio Travel news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
