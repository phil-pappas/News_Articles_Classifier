Admittedly, the bucolic spot felt incongruously cheerful for a paranormal encounter. A low sun splayed its rays over the blue water and the majestic red brick walls of the Renaissance castle next to me. Couples with ice cream strolled around the embankment and sea gulls floated above. No phantoms materialized. I was probably several centuries too late. For it was there, along the ramparts of Kronborg Castle, that Hamlet, prince of Denmark , encountered the ghost of his murdered father, setting in motion the revenge story that propels what is perhaps the most famous literary work in the English language. A devotee of “Hamlet,” I had taken the 45-minute train ride up the coast from Copenhagen to the town of Elsinore (called Helsingor in Denmark) to immerse myself in the Renaissance-era “Elsinore” Castle — as Shakespeare called it — and stroll among the town’s centuries-old edifices. But I was also keen to witness Elsinore’s recent renaissance. Though the town enjoyed centuries as a prosperous royal outpost (thanks mainly to taxes levied on foreign trade ships passing through the adjacent sound that separates Denmark from Sweden), its fortunes ebbed in the 1980s with the collapse of its shipbuilding industry. The docklands wasted away. The town’s income became dependent on Swedish day-trippers, who would ferry over to buy cheap booze. Photo The M/S Maritime Museum of Denmark.

Following a major municipal effort, the town now has cutting-edge cultural venues, public artworks and cultural festivals to augment its time-honored appeal. From the train station, I threaded my way past churches with green copper spires and gabled, half-timbered houses in fanciful colors — peach, mustard, sage — toward the newest attraction, the M/S Maritime Museum of Denmark. Everywhere, the town flaunted its nautical past. Model ships and sailor hats peeked out from boutique windows. On a wall, a mural depicted a cartoonish vision of the harbor, replete with three-masted ships, buccaneers, sailors, fishmongers and spyglass-toting explorers. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Things took a turn for the strange along the docks, where a giant fish had been assembled from colorful plastic flotsam and jetsam, like watering cans, dish racks, garden tools and children’s toys. Nearby, a silvery boy sat on a silvery rock and stared forlornly out to sea. A male counterpart to the famous Little Mermaid statue in Copenhagen, the highly polished stainless-steel statue of Han (“Him” in Danish) was unveiled in 2012 by Elmgreen and Dragset, a contemporary art pair known for their sometimes provocative public art installations around the world.

Opened in 2013, the subterranean space is built into the U-shaped perimeter of a disused dry dock where large ships were once serviced. The design comes courtesy of the Bjarke Ingels Group (a.k.a. BIG), an envelope-pushing young Danish architectural firm that has built an impressive international portfolio and racked up abundant awards. The result is an enveloping sensory experience, part nautical fun house and part time capsule. Ambling along uneven floors (which mimic being at sea) I was subsumed in cinematic music, colored lights, projected films and noises of boat horns and sea gulls. Display cases resembling old portholes and stacked chests revealed the accouterments of old-time shipboard journeys, from “hardtack” sailor biscuits to sextants and sundials. The interactive exhibits revealed something else: my unfitness for maritime life. In an ersatz old-world tattoo parlor, I stenciled the word Mor (Mother) on my forearm with a buzzing pen meant to mimic a needle. The shaky, amateurish result would have left any mother ashamed. In a soaring hall dedicated to contemporary global shipping, equipped with computer terminals and a huge projected map of seaborne transport lanes, my attempts to route a container ship from Australia to Bangladesh resulted in a half-million-dollar loss for my “company.” Exposed as a landlubber, I consoled myself with fish and chips in the atrium-like restaurant of the Culture Yard next door. Formerly part of the town shipyard, the industrial building has been fully overhauled and outfitted with a jagged glass facade suggesting transparent origami. Today the building houses auditoriums, exhibition areas, a multimedia library and other spaces to host an annual roster of concerts, theater and cinema.

Valorizing sea shanties and world music — Greek blues, Cuban folk, Afrobeat — the event pays homage to Elsinore’s past as an international port. (Another new event, the multimedia Click Festival, looks instead to the future, exploring “the field between art, science and technology.”) “We thought it would be a great way to tell the story of Elsinore as a maritime city,” said Mikael Fock, the Knejpe Festival organizer, whom I chanced upon while waiting to enter a subterranean bar called Holger Danske. Throngs of revelers ambled unsteadily through the streets as musicians lugged instruments into various venues. “There are at least 13 traditional bars left in Elsinore,” Mr. Fock said. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T15:03:33.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
