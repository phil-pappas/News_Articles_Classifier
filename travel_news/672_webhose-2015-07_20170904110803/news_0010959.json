Fly-cruise customers will be charged a fee of around £285 per person to account for the difference in flight costs. \nThe new sailings will be available to UK guests on a cruise-only basis from Thursday July 9. \nGianni Onorato, chief executive of MSC Cruises, said: “The move to Cuba proves our commitment to offer our guests and holiday-makers the best and most sought-after destinations as they become accessible – thus further enhancing our global offering while providing travellers best-in-class experiences and service.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T15:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T17:18:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
