Just visit the website, create a user name and password, and select your contact options. After that, you’ll receive an email with membership details and program information. Once you have your account, you’ll want to set up your Double Dip earnings style by choosing to earn either extra HHonors points per stay, or a variable or fixed amount of airline miles. \nEarning Points: \nHHonors gives business travelers lots of ways to earn points. The most basic is simply by staying at Hilton (or one of the Hilton family) hotels. Travelers can earn points at over 3,500 Hilton hotels. \nThe program also features a Double Dip feature, which allows travelers to both earn HHonors points, as well as airline miles, in either a fixed or variable amount. For example, with fixed airline miles you can earn up to 500 miles per stay, while variable miles provide one mile for each dollar spent. \nThe basic rate is 10 points for each eligible U.S. dollar charged to your room for stays at all participating Hilton, Conrad, Doubletree, Embassy Suites, and Hilton Garden Inn and Hilton Grand Vacations Club hotels. \nAs of 2013, Hilton announced new levels for their premium members:- Gold status requires 20 stays, 40 nights, or 75,000 Base Points- Diamond status requires 30 stays, 60 nights, or 120,000 Base Points \nTravelers can also earn HHonors points in a number of other ways, including car rentals, credit cards, cellular services, shopping, dining, and even rail travel. For example, car rentals (Alamo, Avis, Budget, Europcar, National, Sixt, and Thrifty) can earn points, although you may need to stay at a Hilton hotel to accrue car rental points. \nRedeeming Points: \nThe program also gives business travelers plenty of ways to redeem points, from the usual hotel stays to special experience rewards. \nRedeeming points is easy. Simply visit the HHonors Rewards page , select the reward category (hotels, experience rewards, gold rewards, car rentals, cruises, entertainment parks, or shopping & dining). From there, the website will detail your options. For example, standard hotel rewards are divided into different categories based on the type of hotel you want to stay at. Rewards start at 7,500 points for basic hotels in category one up to 50,000 points for hotels in category seven. Special hotels like the Waldorf Astoria brand have high season and low season options. \nVIP-level members can also take advantage of VIP-only rewards. \nOnce you’ve booked your reward, HHonors will send you a reward certificate and ID number. You’ll need to print out that certificate and present it at check in or when you use your reward.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T14:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T02:11:55.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
