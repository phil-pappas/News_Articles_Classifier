Buddy Candy Store sells candies in all shapes, sizes and colours, including its bestselling giant gummy bears imported from the US, weighing up to 2.2kg.\nWhat usually strikes first-time visitors is the ethereal colourful floating glass balloons that run through the ceiling of the entire shop. All the goodies are imported from abroad, with most of the toy candies coming from Japan, while the extensive range of beautifully packaged candies, from lollies to large-scale towering pieces of art, are imported from Europe, the US and Southeast Asia.\nExpect to find plenty of cartoon characters, from Disney to Hello Kitty. Both locals and expats come here to shop for candies, for a lolly-on-the-go, or to order special packages for children's birthday parties and events. This summer, Buddy Candy Store is organising children's parties in the shop's space, accommodating up to 20 youngsters. Whether shopping for gifts or picking up some candy, you're spoiled for choice with sweets that range from five patacas to 500 patacas.\nAvenida de Demetrio Cinatti, Macau, tel: +853 2835 8222.
