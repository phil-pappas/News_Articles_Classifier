It boasts two-thirds of the state’s vineyard acreage and more than a quarter of its wineries.\n“It’s a really well-kept secret,” said Jay Christianson, owner of Canyon Wind Cellars.\nPalisade is also known for peaches, lavender and alpacas — yes, alpacas — as well as the 25 area wineries.\nUnlike rambling go-to vino destinations such as California’s Napa Valley, here 22 wineries are within a 7-mile radius.\nDoug Caskey, executive director of the Colorado Wine Industry Development Board, said red and white grapes grow well here.\n“It’s hard to say Colorado has one signature wine, because we have such a diversity of climates,” he said.\nPalisade is about a two-hour drive from cities such as Moab in Utah and Aspen, Vail and Telluride in Colorado. It’s just east of Grand Junction.\n“The wineries give people the reason to really stay awhile in Palisade,” said Juliann Adams, executive director of the Palisade Chamber of Commerce. “You can do quite a few wineries in a short trip, and most of the time the owners and-or the winemakers are right there, and they’re the ones you can talk directly to.”\nPalisade’s quaint downtown includes an art studio, the Blue Pig Gallery, with mountain-inspired paintings, and Slice O’ Life Bakery, offering doughnuts and pumpernickel bread. Local wines are on the menu at Palisade Cafe.\nWhile in other destinations a group might rent a limo to tour wineries, here walking or biking is common.\nMost tasting rooms are open year-round, excluding holidays.\nMany wineries, but not all, offer free tastings. Like what you try? Bottles range from a $13 riesling at DeBeque Canyon Winery to a $100 blended red, the 2012 IV, at Canyon Wind Cellars.\nAt Carlson Vineyards, winemakers pose the question, “Why make drinking wine complicated?” and give their wines names like Tyrannosaurus Red and Laughing Cat Sweet Baby White.\nCanyon Wind is getting maxed out on the weekends: As many as 500 people can come through on a summer weekend.\nThe tasting room, a former office, feels full with 10 people.\n“My father was a firm believer that nobody would ever come to western Colorado to be a tourist,” owner Jay Christianson said.\nNow, he said, the winery is planning a larger tasting space.\nThe 50 acres, which Christianson took over in 2009 with his wife, Jennifer, include nine kinds of grapes.\nWhen they met, she’d tried wine about six times.\nAt Maison la Belle Vie Winery, winemaker and chef John Barbier incorporates elements from France, where his family has tended grapevines for more than a century. Even the barista is French.\nVisitors park their bikes in racks fashioned from wine barrels.\nMany who come for a tasting buy a glass or bottle and enjoy the view in the courtyard, where mountains frame the vineyards.\nRed Fox Cellars is named after animals seen scurrying around the vineyard.\nOwner Sherrie Hamilton said the winery ages its wines in bourbon barrels, which adds a smoky, rich flavor.\nRed Fox also offers hard ciders and mixed drinks, such as an Old-Fashioned that pairs its Bourbon Barrel Merlot with cherries, simple syrup and club soda.\nRachel Romero, who pours at Red Fox and another tasting room in town, grew up nearby. She noted how the region “just took off” in recent years as tourists arrived with winery-packed itineraries.\n“I get surprised by how many people are coming to town just for that,” she said.\nAlison Bowen,\nChicago Tribune\nWhen you go Rent bikes and pick up a map at Rapid Creek Cycles in Palisade. Routes are well marked by signs noting the Palisade Fruit & Wine Byway, which meanders past orchards, lavender farms and locals’ homes. Although bike lanes aren’t yet fully in action, vehicles are respectful and traffic manageable.\nIn the summer, enjoy a farmers market with bands and cooking demonstrations. Prime wine time would be Sept. 17-20, when the town hosts the Colorado Mountain Winefest, featuring a grape stomp, demonstrations and dozens of wineries. Experience it on two wheels with the Tour de Vineyards, a 25-mile ride.\nFind out more at visitpalisade.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T00:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T21:22:12.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
