For lightening the load, it’s best to find a shoe with many talents — like the Chaco OutCross Evo 1. The breathable mesh and webbing upper plus the protective toe bumper keeps the shoes securely on your feet (and your toes safe) when you’re in the water. But the addition of a rugged outsole that’s solid enough for hiking once you’re on land means less slipping and sliding. Chaco’s comfortable Luvseat footbed means you’re not kicking these shoes off the second your adventures are over.\nWhat we liked: It’s a good thing when a brand makes a shoe like this for both women and men. That way, nobody’s envious of the other’s technology. Also, no blaming your shoes when you can’t keep up, boys.\nNot so much: The OutCross Evo outsole, made with 25 percent recycled rubber, is burly enough for hiking but not if you’re going to do some major mileage. Additionally, the open construction can let in irritating pebbles.\nVitals: Chaco Women’s OutCross Evo 1 shoes, $110 from www.chacos.com .\n— Jill K.
