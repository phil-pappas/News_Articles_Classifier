This process we have for Canton Fair enables our agency partners to provide a value-added service to their customers and increase their revenues at the same time.” \n\nAcknowledging that “competition has become very keen”, Yu said Canton Fair must “maintain its pioneering lead and be innovative in expanding its distribution channels”. \n\nHence, besides engaging Travelport for marketing and ticketing, Canton Fair has been cooperating with chambers of commerce, travel agencies, airlines and marketing companies to introduce various business programmes. \n\n“For example the fair has launched an Advertisement Reward for New Buyers, a programme that rewards qualified buyers for their first visit to the fair, and a Buyer Recruitment Program for our business partners. We also organise video conferences that broadcast live promotions with Canton Fair partners from different continents. On social media Canton Fair has a massive 250,000 followers on Facebook and that figure continues to grow,” Yu said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T11:12:18.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
