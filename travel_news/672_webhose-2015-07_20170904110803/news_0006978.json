A. Barata told AFP. \"We don't know when it will reopen, we will monitor the situation.\" \nVolcanic ash from Raung had already closed Bali's international airport two times this month, between July 9 and 12, forcing almost 900 flights to be cancelled or delayed and creating a backlog that took days to clear. \nThe shutdown on Bali, a top holiday destination that attracts millions of visitors from around the world to its palm-fringed beaches every year, has come during one of the busiest times of the year for the tourist industry. \nThe latest shutdown will also cause major disruption for domestic tourists, as millions are making their way back home after going away for last week's Muslim holiday of Eid. \nAustralian airlines Virgin Australia and Jetstar said they were cancelling flights on Wednesday to and from Bali, a favourite holiday destination for Australians. It was not immediately clear how many flights would be cancelled by the new airport closure. \nIndonesian government vulcanologist Gede Suantika said Raung was shooting out ash 3,000 metres (10,000 feet) into the air on Wednesday, and the wind was blowing it southeast towards Bali. \nAir traffic is regularly disrupted by volcanic eruptions in Indonesia, which sits on a belt of seismic activity running around the basin of the Pacific Ocean and is home to the highest number of active volcanoes in the world at around 130. \nThe main concern for airlines regarding volcanic ash is not that it can affect visibility but rather that it could damage aircraft, as ash turns into molten glass when it is sucked into jet engines, according to experts. \nGet full Bangkok Post printed newspaper experience on your digital devices with Bangkok Post e-newspaper .
