The project also includes the implementation of a widened and extended runway, with 10 km of taxiways capable of accommodating A380 size aircraft linking the runway to the terminal building and ensuring the fast and efficient movement of aircraft. \nThis Public Private Partnership (PPP) and fast track Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) project was completed in 30 months and is the first USGBC LEED GOLD Certified airport terminal outside of the USA and is also the first in the MENA region. The General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA), as Grantor, has contracted with Tibah, as Investor, through a Build Operate and Transfer Agreement which is the first airport privatization in Saudi Arabia. The Tibah Consortium, which comprises TAV Airports with Al Rajhi and Saudi Oger, appointed a Contractor Consortium comprising TAV Airports and ACC to design and construct Phase 1 facilities. The value of the contract was approximately US$ 1.2 billion. \nThe new terminal and airfield is built to the highest international standards and allows for an initial operating capacity of 8 million passengers per year. The terminal is modular to allow for expansion in Phase 2 to suit the expected future increases in passenger and aircraft traffic, with state-of-the-art facilities affirming PMIA's current and future role as a major gateway for scheduled passengers, as well as Hajj and Umrah Pilgrims to the Holy City of Madinah and the greater Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. \nThe project includes a mosque for 1,000 worshippers, and 20 support buildings including dedicated Hajj facilities for Hajj passengers, and a new Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting Building. \nCH2M, a global engineering consultancy with over 40 years of transportation infrastructure experience in the Saudi Arabia, was appointed jointly by GACA and Tibah to be the Independent Engineer for the Project. Using experts from the UK, USA and the Middle East, CH2M reviewed the design and provided a team on site to monitor that the facilities were in accordance with the agreed technical requirements. \nJoe Stratford, CH2M's Project Director, said: \"This iconic infrastructure project will facilitate increasing growth in passenger numbers and aircraft movements through provision of world-class modern airport airfield, passenger terminal and landside infrastructure.
