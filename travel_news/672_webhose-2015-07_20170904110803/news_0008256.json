Bath, who lives on the Gold Coast, gets paid to travel to places and then use social media to promote it to her followers. \nIt sounds like the perfect job, but Bath said the work was relentless and involved 12 to 14-hour days. A photo posted by Lauren Bath (@laurenepbath) on Jul 8, 2015 at 9:42pm PDT \nHer aim is to make people aware of places and for followers to remember her trip and hopefully book their own. \nThe path to digital influencer success was hard work for Bath, who also had a little luck along the way. \nThat luck took the form of being in the right place at the right time. Soon after Bath got her first iPhone she got interested in photography. She was browsing the App Store one day and saw an app called Instagram and not knowing what it was, downloaded it and signed up. It was love at first sight and she soon moved from phone photography to buying a DSLR and spending any spare time she had while working as a chef to improve her pictures and develop her following. \"My photography was evolving as my page was so I was able to reach out to the community on Instagram whenever I wanted to learn anything. \"This made people very invested in my photography progression.\" Mar 3, 2015 at 4:33pm PST \nThen things really took off. Ad Feedback \nIn early 2012, Facebook bought Instagram and the app became available on Android phones and Bath was able to hitch a ride. \n\"Heaps of people were joining the platform everyday so I was gaining about 1000 followers a day over a period of several months.\" By the end of that year, Bath had about 200,000 followers and began thinking about how she could turn her hobby into a new career. \"I had an inkling that there was potential and that my reach was valuable.\" It started off by getting products in exchange for posting something on Instagram and doing small travel jobs. A few days into 2013, she quit her job as a chef. On her last day she received three opportunities and hasn't stop working. \"I had an inkling it wasn't photography I was moving into, it would be influencing. I didn't really know what that meant, I just knew I wanted to travel ... I wanted to take pictures and I loved Instagram and social media.\" Within six months, Bath had perfected her approach was earning more than she had as a chef. \"I worked really hard and I was lucky. There was a massive interest in it, and a gap in the market and I was there at the right time to fill it.

Having 20,000 followers and getting a few hundred likes is not enough.\" \"You need a lot of eyes on your content. You need a lot of people to really grasp what it is that you are doing for it to be valuable.\" As well as followers, Bath said people need to diversify and build a platform around themselves before they can turn it into a job. \"People that are desperately trying to do this as a means to an end, I think it's quite transparent. People that are doing it because they genuinely love photography, they are going to grow that audience organically anyway. \n\"Once you have a fanbase that is genuinely interested in what you are doing, then you will be successful and valuable to your clients.\" \nThe one downside to the dream job is that there is no switching off. \n\"My job is my lifestyle, it's what I'm about, it's my brand. There's not part of my day when I can just clock off. \n\"It can be very all-consuming. My partner is constantly trying to drag me off my phone. \nThere's a lot that goes on behind the scenes that people don't realise in order to get to the level I'm at. \n\"I'm just busy all the time and I get busier every year.\" \nLAUREN'S INSTAGRAM TIPS \nContent: The better your pictures or videos are, the more people will want to follow you, says Bath. She also said you should only post your best work and to cull the duds. \nEngagement: Bath says being a good Instagrammer is important. This means commenting on posts, liking pictures, being passionate about what you're doing and starting interesting discussions. \nConsistency: Make sure the style and quality of your posts are consistent. Also, post and engage with others on a regular basis. \"People like to know what they are getting into when they follow you,\" says Bath. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T03:43:12.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
