We both have fish tanks with me keeping piranhas and Lisa a couple of turtles and we were on our way to look at the fish section,” Gavin told The Sun UK (subscription) .\n“We called at a supermarket and bought a few bottles. It was a hot day and the booze must have got the better of us.\n“We were passing the phone box and laughing and joking and I said to Lisa, ‘Fancy a quickie?’ and obviously she did.\n“Even though the box is near the road it faces open countryside and we really didn’t think anyone would notice.”\nWOMAN PERFORMS SEX ACT ON PLANE\nTRAIN PASSENGERS FILM SEX ACT\nFILMED HAVING SEX IN OFFICE\n‘I heard a car going but I didn’t think it was blowing at us. I wasn’t really concentrating on what was going on outside because I was enjoying myself,’ said Gavin Wain who had phone sex with partner Lisa Kerely.

The woman driver turned round and honked the horn, while her husband took a picture.\nThe female driver told Tamworth Informed: “Thankfully there were no children in the car with us, or playing in the busy residential area!”\nShe added: “Complete dirtbags! My passenger took the pictures as we wanted to warn people”\nThe Sun UK put the pictures online and asked if anyone knew the couple.\n“We have had dozens of calls from people who recognised us but we are not ashamed and can’t really see what all the fuss is about,” said Gavin.\n“We like having sex outdoors. It’s healthy and gives you an extra buzz.\n“I heard a car going but I didn’t think it was blowing at us. I wasn’t really concentrating on what was going on outside because I was enjoying myself.”\nThe pair have been dating for one year. Lisa, who has four children from a previous relationship, said that did not think anyone could see them.\n“We were both in the mood and were just taken short as we passed the phone box,” Lisa said..\n“We do like sex outdoors but don’t do it in front of people on purpose.\n“Gavin’s got a great body from all his boxing training and sometimes I can’t help jumping on him — whether we are indoors or not.\n“We had a day out and had both had a fair bit to drink so I suppose you could say we were both tipsy and in the mood.\n“We had not planned to have it in the phone box but he suggested it as we walked by and I wasn’t going to say no.\n“I went in first and he followed me in and it just happened.\n“I thought folks going past would just think it was two people making a call. I didn’t think we could be seen because of the reflection.\n“It wasn’t a full-on session because we didn’t have the room but we were having sex.”\nOriginally published as Phone box sex pair: ‘What’s the fuss?’", "external_links": ["http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/6555744/Phone-box-pair-boast-of-outdoor-sex.html", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/24/1227455/256718-c4004d6e-3194-11e5-9ab0-19db9af17447.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/relationships/couple-unashamed-of-being-pictured-having-sex-in-phone-box/story-fnet0gt3-1227455182488", "http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/6554566/Couple-caught-having-sex-in-phonebox-in-Nuneaton.html", "http://www.tamworthinformed.co.uk/sex-in-tamworth-phone-box/"], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:05:52.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
