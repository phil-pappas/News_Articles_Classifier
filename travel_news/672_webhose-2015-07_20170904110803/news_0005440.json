Business travelers just aren’t that into you anymore. \nA new study by Certify — which makes software that companies use to compile expense reports for their business travelers — finds that for the first time ever, more business travelers used Uber instead of taxis.“I think it clearly indicates a wholesale shift in the business traveler’s perspective about ground transportation,” Certify CEO Bob Neveu says of the second quarter report, which Certify compiled using millions of receipts and expense reports business travelers filed using the company’s app. “This is the first time in aggregate where we have more Uber expenses going through our system than we have general taxi expenses.” \nRelated 11 Things You Need to Know About Airbnb Before You Book \nIn Certify’s head-to-head analysis of taxis vs. ridesharing services, Uber accounted for 55 percent of the ground transportation costs business travelers expensed last quarter. Taxis were well behind at 43 percent. Uber’s competitor, Lyft, was left in the dust at a tiny 1 percent, tied with other ridesharing services. \nUber is doing some serious cab crushing among business travelers. (Infographic: Certify) Neveu notes that Uber’s bread and butter appears to be large groups of coworkers who hit the road together. “If you have a group of 10 traveling, people are saying, ‘Instead of having to get shuttle vans, let’s just get two Uber SUVs.”Price may be another reason business travelers appear to be kicking taxis to the curb. Certify says the average cost-per-ride for taxis last quarter was $34.48. For Uber, however, it was $30.03. Lyft was even lower at $22.51. Rental car companies in the crosshairs, too \nAnd now that Uber has dispatched with taxis, rental cars may be next. According to Certify’s study, rental cars still accounted for the largest share, 45 percent, of business ground transportation expenses. But that’s down from 55 percent during the same quarter last year. But in that same period, Uber expenses exploded from 8 percent to 31 percent. \n“Nowadays business travelers have to really ask the question, ‘Do I really need a rental car, or should I just take an Uber?’” says Neveu. “If you’re going to rent a car, it might cost you $100, $150. You have to deal with the drop-off, the pickup, the return. But if you only need to take one or two trips [during your business trip], you might be able to get by with an Uber and have it cost less.”Neveu says his data shows it’s only a matter of time before rental cars, like taxis, are left in the rearview mirror behind Uber, as far as business travelers are concerned. \n“This is now six quarters of consistent growth in Uber’s share of ground transportation,” he says. “I don’t see anything that would indicate that that will stop or slow down at this stage.” \nIs there a “silver lyning” for Lyft? \nDespite its paltry 1 percent market share in Certify’s report, there’s a bright side for Uber’s bitter rival, Lyft. Kind of…Certify found that as far as business traveler satisfaction goes, Lyft scored higher than Uber, rental cars, and taxis. Plus, Lyft saw a 153 percent increase in preference from the previous quarter.Still they probably should hold off on the champagne bottles at Lyft’s HQ. “They may double in growth from 1 percent to 2 percent,“ Neveu says dismissively. But pointing to Uber’s 55 percent, and growing, market share, Neveu says Lyft is going to have to up its game if it’s going to appeal to business travelers.“Lyft’s business service has not really resonated with the business community in terms of thinking about it as a viable option or a competitor to a taxi or rental car,” he says. Airbnb Boom The sharing economy isn’t just affecting transportation; it’s also affecting where business travelers stay. Certify’s new report finds that after Airbnb launched its business service a year ago, the home-sharing service grew 143 percent from last quarter among business travelers. \nNeveu believes the growth is fueled by coworkers who travel together on business. “Say you have a group from a company that’s going to a trade show,” he says. “They’re bringing multiple people from the company, and they need to get blocks of hotel rooms — three, four, or five of them. Sometimes it’s easier just to go on Airbnb and get a large house.” \nBusiness travelers pay more and stay longer when they use Airbnb. (Infographic: Certify) \nAirbnb’s business clients tend to travel in groups and stay for multiple nights, and that may explain why the average Airbnb stay expensed via Certify is $571.53 over 3.8 nights — more than double the $222.55 over 2.1 nights spent on hotels, which, Neveu explains, are still preferred by businesspeople traveling alone for a short stay. \n“That’s the key driver [behind Airbnb’s growth among business travelers],” Neveu says. “Larger parties renting bigger properties for multiple nights.”An amusing part of Certify’s report shows the city where businesspeople use ridesharing services and Airbnb the most is San Francisco — where Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb happened to be headquartered. Still, Neveu believes we’re looking at a national phenomenon. \n“The sharing economy works across all industries and all people,” he says. And traditional travel-related companies are starting to notice which way the winds are blowing; hotel chain Starwood recently partnered with Uber to give passengers Starwood rewards points for using the ridesharing service. One may ask why Starwood would aid and abet the biggest name in the very same sharing industry that’s threatening its fellow traditional travel-related companies. But as the sharing economy continues to make a killing in the $300 billion business travel industry, it’s every man for himself — a concept business travelers certainly can appreciate. \nLet Yahoo Travel inspire you every day.
