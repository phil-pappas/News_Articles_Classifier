There are composers, painters, writers and philosophers -- and a few actors and rock stars in the mix. With such a distinguished list, some of the city's parks of eternal rest have become places of pilgrimage, awe and sometimes just sheer fun. Pere Lachaise The best known of the city's cemeteries, Pere Lachaise -- often simply called pere -- is also its largest. It's possible to wander for hours along the roads and pathways and past the eerie crematorium and chapel. Ancient crypts and mausoleums, some with the doors hanging off the hinges as though its occupants have just left, look a little like telephone boxes. Others are more imaginative. There's Oscar Wilde's grave, now encased in glass to prevent fervent fans leaving lipstick kisses on the white stone -- even though it's adorned with an Art Deco man-in-flight whose pouting lips seem to be asking for exactly that. Just around the corner is the plain grave of the arguably better writer Marcel Proust. Alas, he's relegated to second row, attracting only simple offerings on his black headstone. There's the grave of Victor Noir, nom de plume for journalist Yvan Salmon. Salmon died in a political scuffle, pretty much an unknown, but in death he has become a weird fertility symbol, despite dying when he was engaged but unmarried. His life-sized bronze, sculpted to lie as he fell with his hat by his side, is frequently visited by women seeking to improve their fecundity, their sex life or chances of meeting a husband. They leave a flower in Victor's hat, rub his now-shiny nether regions and maybe give him a kiss on the lips and leave full of hope. Who else lies there? Jim Morrison, Edith Piaf, Maria Callas, Sarah Bernhardt, Honore de Balzac, Georges Bizet, Frederic Chopin, Moliere, Marcel Marceau. Other graves worth seeing Belgian writer Georges Rodenbach's grave features a bronze of him trying to break out of his tomb. Somewhat disturbing but artistically pleasing. How to get there Metros 2 and 3 both have stops near the cemetery. Stops Pere Lachaise, Gambetta and Philippe Auguste all lead to different entry gates to the vast cemetery. It's worth keeping in mind that the side gates, such as the one near Pere Lachaise Metro station are often closed, and the stop closest to Oscar Wilde and Victor Noir is Gambetta. Kissable: Oscar Wilde's tomb in Pere Lachaise cemetery. Cimitiere de Montmartre On the hilly slopes of ancient Montmartre within an old quarry, this cemetery offers a perfect example of Paris's mix of history and architecture. When Georges-Eugene Haussmann set about expanding his 19th century vision of grand open boulevards to open up the area of Montmartre, this cemetery was nearly lost. It survived only because of loud protests from bereaved families whose loved-ones' graves ended up intact but being spanned by a clunky iron bridge. Here peaceful streets patrolled by more or less friendly cemetery cats are lined with graves including those of saxophone inventor Adolphe Sax and the De Gas family, whose famous son Edgar Degas used artistic freedom to alter his family name a little. Who doesn't lie here? The impressive grave of novelist and \"J'accuse\" (an 1898 newspaper article accusing the French government of anti-Semitism) writer Emile Zola is somewhat misleading. He used to be there, but six years after his death, he was unearthed and his remains transferred to the Pantheon national mausoleum to lie in state with other big names in French history. How to get there Metro lines 2 and 13 to Place de Clichy, or the 2 to Blanche. Follow the Boulevard de Clichy and turn into Avenue Rachel to enter under the bridge. Bridge over troubled graveyard: Montmatre's cemetery. Cimitiere des Chiens Strictly speaking it's just outside Paris proper's city limits, but this little cemetery is nevertheless worth the metro ride. Overlooking the Seine and some not so picturesque apartment blocks, this is a graveyard for dogs and other domestic animals. Among some grand tombs erected for little pooches, often sadly signed \"your loving mom\" and telling a story in themselves, there's a sheep, a couple of horses, a rabbit, a monkey and a hen. The hen's grave is inscribed, in translation: \"To my affectionate hen, who lived for 16 years, a faithful inseparable companion, mourned by your mistress who remains, inconsolable. To you I was attached, you will never be forgotten.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T18:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T19:18:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
