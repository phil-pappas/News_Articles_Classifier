Photographer's Note \nThe Japan Square is located in Agua Verde neighborhood in the city of Curitiba. The square is a tribute to Japanese immigrants who arrived in Curitiba in 1910. Curitiba has the second largest Japanese community in Brazil, behind only SÃ£o Paulo, and today houses more than 32,000 of Japanese descent. Its construction was from 1958 to 1962. It has a Japanese Gateway, the Memorial of Japanese Immigration, the Municipal Library of Japan Square (where japanese publications are available), the Tea House and the House of Culture, where you can know the paper folding art (origami), floral art (ikebana) and the three lines poems (hai-kai). In a wooded area of 14 thousand square meters, there are many cherry trees and six artificial lakes in japanese style placed in the square. 30 of cherry tress were donated by the Japanese government and came directly from Japan. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T12:42:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
