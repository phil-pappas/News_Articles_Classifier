Olsen’s Sales team are visiting agents in the Southampton area during July, and are providing them with a variety of ‘point of sale’ materials to highlight the benefits of booking a Fred. Olsen Summer cruise. The campaign also features prominent TV and radio advertising, door drops and national and regional press promotions.\nFred. Olsen has a clear focus on ‘bringing the world closer to you’, taking guests from convenient, regional UK departure ports to hundreds of exciting destinations around the globe, aboard its fleet of four smaller, more intimate ships – Balmoral, Braemar, Boudiccaand Black Watch.\nFred. Olsen’s classically-styled, smaller-scale ships are able to access many ports around the world that larger cruise ships cannot: taking guests into the heart of iconic cities, river cruising through breathtaking landscapes, past soaring fjords, and to soft, sandy beaches, bathed in sunshine. During its 2016/17 cruise season, Fred. Olsen will be visiting 253 destinations in 84 countries – more than ever before!\nThe relatively small size of Fred. Olsen’s ships means that there is a relaxed and friendly atmosphere on board, where guests and crew quickly get to know each other; Fred. Olsen’s famous ‘service with a smile’, fantastic five-star cuisine and elegant, stylish ships all help to create a holiday to remember!\nFred. Olsen is pleased to have been awarded the ‘Gold Trusted Merchant’ status by independent review site Feefo in 2015, for the second year in a row. This accreditation is based on genuine customer feedback and, to date, Fred. Olsen has received over 11,000 reviews, with 95% of these being in the ‘Good’ or ‘Excellent’ categories.\nRelated Posts Fred.
