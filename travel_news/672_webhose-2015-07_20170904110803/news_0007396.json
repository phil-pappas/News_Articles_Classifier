The property, recently acquired by new ownership, will be split into two separate Wyndam Family hotels — a Ramada Plaza and a Baymont Inn & Suites. The Ramada will operate as a 195-room, full-service hotel. It will house a 32,000-square-foot conference center. The Baymont Inn & Suites will be a select-service hotel and will have 100 rooms. The property will undergo major interior and exterior renovations and upgrades to accommodate its transformation into two hotels. Shawn Kvernen , vice president of hotel operations for K Partners, said the extensive renovations will include a shared front desk for both properties. The guest rooms and lobby, as well as restaurant and lounge spaces, will be updated. The renovations will take about a year to complete, according to Kvernen. Mary Hill , senior vice president of sales and marketing for K Partners, said the plan for the two hotels is to offer “a dual brand with distinct offerings and price points,” creating two “different, but equally satisfying experiences.” K Partners, founded in 1996, has built, operated, and managed a wide portfolio of multi-branded hotels in several markets. \nWant San Antonio Travel   Related Content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T00:38:03.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
