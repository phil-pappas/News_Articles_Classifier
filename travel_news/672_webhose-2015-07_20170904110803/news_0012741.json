The Treeclimber’s Guide to London by Jack Cooke is billed as a “charming account” of the 80 trees he has climbed in the past year. HarperCollins beat four competing publishers to secure the worldwide rights with an advance of close to £75,000. It is an unusually high figurefor an unknown author – famously, JK Rowling received an advance of just £1,500 for the first Harry Potter book.

The viewers over London were so extraordinary and I thought, this is really a lost wilderness that I want to explore,” he said. “There is this real divide between adults and children in terms of attitude. Adults don’t climb trees any more, and it’s not about fear- it’s shame, a feeling of ‘I can’t climb a tree because that would be undignified’.” Fork-tongued beech and a giant chestnut #snakesandladders #climbingtrees #richmondpark #treeofknowledge #serpent #coiling #branches #dwarfed #green #heights #lostinthewoods #greencloak #dayaway #parklife #exploring #treetops A photo posted by Jack Cooke (@treetopcity) on Jun 20, 2015 at 2:00am PDT Cooke has climbed trees all over the capital – mostly in parks but also by canals, roadsides and even roundabouts - and said he often goes unnoticed. “People never look up in London. You can spend hours in trees and no-one notices you. The embarrassing bit is coming down out of a tree and crash-landing in a picnic that someone has set out while you’ve been up there.” The legality of climbing trees in public parks is a grey area, he added.

There are various bylaws, someone saying vague things such as you’re not allowed to climb trees without a reasonable excuse. “The only time I’ve been stopped was when a woman rang up and told the police I was trying to hang myself. The policeman who turned up found it incredibly funny, but even he was unclear about whether or not I should be climbing trees.” The book is a cross between a how-to guide and “a daydreamer’s handbook”, according to HarperCollins, who said it tapped into the current trend for books on “mindfulness” and urban escape.

Jack Fogg, publishing director at HarperCollins, said: “Jack’s book is truly one of a kind. He writes beautifully on nature and its convergence with city life, and brings an elegant, lyrical and unassuming tone to his writing which fits perfectly with the subject.” Cooke’s literary agent, Claudia Young, said: “An advance like this is definitely unusual.

As soon as I sent it out, the response was fantastic. There were five publishers in the running and they all got the book straight away. “It is lyrical and escapist reading for the armchair tree climber, who can climb vicariously through Jack. But it is also a practical guide. “When he writes about climbing in Hyde Park, there isn’t necessarily a specific tree you should go out and find. It’s not about giving you the exact GPS coordinates for a tree, it’s about encouraging the reader to see the potential in climbing trees.” Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T18:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T18:26:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
