As medical-related costs continue to rise in the US, millions are searching for other cost-effective outlets abroad. \nIn 2014, over 1.2 million Americans traveled abroad for medical procedures including, but not limited to, facelifts, rhinoplasty, hip and valve replacements, etc. Depending upon the country and type of treatment, those seeking elective care overseas save hundreds to thousands of dollars. This trend has been growing globally with 8 million patients now seeking care abroad each year. \nAmong some of the most preferred destinations, Malaysia has been gaining increased attention. The country has received prestigious awards such as the \"Medical Travel Destination of the Year 2015\" award by UK based International Medical Travel Journal. Western-trained doctors and state-of-the-art medical facilities, which have international accreditation, along with low cost of care make Malaysia highly attractive to those considering medical care abroad. \nFurthermore, single tier pricing for locals and foreigners, a favorable exchange rate, and a lower cost of living in Malaysia all contribute to reduced prices. Patients can save between 65-80% on medical procedures when compared with U.S. prices. For example, a facelift that costs approximately $14,500 in the U.S. would cost $4,900 in Malaysia. A standard valve replacement costing $85,000 USD in America will costs approximately $20,800 USD in Malaysia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T22:06:23.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
