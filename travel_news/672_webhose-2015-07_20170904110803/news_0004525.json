Here’s where to go and when. (Photo: Thinkstock) \nIt’s all fun and games until your vacation spot gets too crowded. \nFor travelers who like to escape from the masses, Marriott International – the massive hotel company that includes its eponymous line, the Ritz Carlton, and Edition Hotels, among others – released a handy infographic with the 32 best off-peak destinations. The list addresses vacationers with a love for light crowds and low budgets. \nThe results are derived from tourism guides rather than calculated survey data, with sources including the New York Times , Travel + Leisure , Learnvest , Transitions Abroad , and Dual Income No Kids Life . \nThe picks span an entire year, with two or three cities listed for each month, so you have a handful of options ready for whenever you’re ready to travel. The breakdown starts with general planning tips for each season: visit the wine country during the winter when tours are less frequent; spring is a great time to hit the slopes because they’ll be less populated. \nRelated: Berkshires in Winter?

For example, you might think that beaches are an overrated no-go for the summer, but since so many beaches are open closer to home (and hurricanes may be on the way), tropical beach destinations are cheaper. Meanwhile, fall is prime time to catch up on the places you missed in the summer. \nHead to New York City in January (if you dare to brave the cold), Thailand in June, Miami in October, and Washington D.C. in December. Find where else to visit for every time of year in the graphic below. \nWould you do Virginia Beach in January and Denver in May?
