IVR enables travel companies to meet PCI compliance standards by temporarily directing the phone call to an external and completely secure automated payment function. \nOnce implemented, a travel company would expect to direct 95 per cent of their call centre bookings through such a service in order to protect and reassure their customers. As well as PCI compliance, the customer benefits from the confidence that their booking will be safe and secure. IVR capability enables customers booking a holiday through an agent to benefit from the choice of either manually reading out their card details or going through to the third party IVR system. If they choose IVR, the customer will follow automated instructions to input their details using their keypad. They will then be transferred back to the agent to complete the booking. Initially, iVector connects with ININ, the third party company that deals with the IVR, and sends card details across for processing; integrations with other similar services will follow. “Adding IVR capabilities to iVector will be hugely beneficial for our customers. This automation offers a more efficient and secure service which giving customers confidence as well speed of service. This is just one of many ways in which state-of-the-art tech can put travel companies ahead of the game,” said Jackie Groves, intuitive’s Sales & Marketing Director.
