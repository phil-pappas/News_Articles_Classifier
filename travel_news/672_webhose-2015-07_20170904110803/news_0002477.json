Larry Hogan announced Friday that a Cleveland airport executive has been appointed CEO of Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport. Ricky Smith Sr., the director of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport as well as that city's Department of Port Control, will serve as the executive director of the Maryland Aviation Administration. He'll oversee BWI, Martin State Airport and other public-use airports across the state. “Ricky has the experience, leadership skills and know-how to take BWI Marshall to the next level,” Hogan said in a statement. “BWI Marshall is a major job generator and economic engine for Maryland, and I’m confident that Ricky will continue to grow domestic and international travel at our world-class airport. I want to thank Paul for his many years of leadership and service to the citizens of Maryland.” Home of the Day Smith replaces Paul Wiedefeld , who worked as the CEO of BWI for a total nine years. Wiedefeld led BWI from 2002 to 2005 , left, and then returned the position in 2009 under former Gov. Martin O'Malley . Neither Smith nor Wiedefeld could be reached for comment. Prior to leaving for Cleveland, Smith worked for the Maryland Aviation Administration for 17 years as the chief operating officer at BWI. Smith, a graduate of Loyola University Maryland, also serves on the board of directors and the policy review board for the American Association of Airport Executives and is a member of the Airport Minority Advisory Council. Smith will take over an airport that is undergoing major construction to add an addition security checkpoint to serve both domestic and international flyers and a secure connector between Concourses D and E. BWI also is planning to establish a full-service hotel that has access to the airport terminal. \nWant Baltimore Travel news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
