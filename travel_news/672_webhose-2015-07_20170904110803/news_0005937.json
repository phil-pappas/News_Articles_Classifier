Time's running out SUNDAY STAR-TIMES Last updated 05:00, July 19 2015 Rob Homer \nKiwis' Christmas budgets are being stretched by expensive flights over the festive season. \nLike many Kiwis, Stephanie Bloy will fly home this Christmas to be with family. \nAnd like many Kiwis, she'll be paying through the nose for her airfares. \nFlights to many New Zealand destinations have already seen significant price hikes for the silly season, even if you're booking a full half-year ahead. Supplied \nStephanie Bloy says airlines are 'cynical' for hiking the price of her Christmas-time flight home by 60 per cent \nBloy is 22, works in public relations, and lives in Freemans Bay, Auckland. She will fly to Christchurch a few days before Christmas to see her family. \nBut even if she books now, her flights will cost up to 60 per cent more than they would at other times of the year. \n\"It's the time when everyone needs to travel, so I feel like airlines make the most of that and put up the prices,\" she says. \nShe says the flights will be a \"significant\" cost at a time of year when her budget is already stretched. \n\"You can see why [the airlines] do it, but I do think it's kind of cynical, because they're making money off people wanting to see their families.\" \nAviation Commentator Peter Clark says just because it's the giving season doesn't mean consumers should expect charity from their airlines. \n\"It's supply and demand, and that's a fact of life,\" he says. Ad Feedback \n\"Airlines need to fill their aircraft, they need to make money, and that's how it works. They're not trying to make excessive profits, they have their fares that are already laid down,\" Clark says. \nThe economics behind the price rises are simple: they go up at Christmas because there is more demand for travel. \nA browse of online flight websites by Fairfax found price rises of between 20 and 100 per cent for the same flight-times, comparing late August and late December. A ticket from Auckland to Invercargill on a Sunday in late December currently costs $488, compared to $248 in August â€“ an increase of almost 100 per cent. Sunday morning flights from Wellington to Nelson are currently available for $79 for late August, but the same flight on December 20 will be almost 40 per cent more expensive, at $109. A Hamilton-Christchurch Sunday morning flight that'll cost $189 in late August rises to $399 on December 20. \nIt's not all bad news for fliers, though. There are still some flights around Christmas time that haven't gone up in price, and some flights from Auckland to destinations including Whanganui, Wellington and Gisborne are currently cheaper at Christmas time than in August. But it's unlikely they will remain that way as the festive season approaches. \nClark thinks Christmas is a time for airlines to make money, just like it is for retail businesses. \nHis advice to holiday travellers is to get in early. \n\"Now is definitely about the time you should be starting to plan your trips around that Christmas period, otherwise the fares will gradually start to climb.\" \n\"If you want to travel at the last minute you will pay the price, and it will be a dear price.\" \nHolidaymakers hoping for a white Christmas overseas also face more expensive air tickets, says Flight Centre NZ general manager Sue Matson. \n\"Christmas is a time when people are on the move. Kiwis are travelling domestically and internationally to visit their relatives, return home or just to escape.\" \nShe said there were a range of ways Kiwis could save money on their holiday airfares, including: booking ahead, driving to a major departure point and skipping add-ons. People could consider travelling on Christmas day itself if they wanted a cheap fare, she said. - Sunday Star Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T02:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T20:55:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
