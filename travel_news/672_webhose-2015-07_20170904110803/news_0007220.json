In a report released Thursday, the National Transportation Safety Board faulted the captain for taking over control from the co-pilot while the plane was just 27 feet above the ground. Eight people suffered minor injuries, and the Boeing 737 was heavily damaged after landing on its nose gear. Southwest later fired the captain. The safety board said that the late change in control left both pilots unable to monitor the plane's altitude. Instead, the board said, the captain should have ordered a so-called go-around - call off the landing, circle and try again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T23:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T08:49:13.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
