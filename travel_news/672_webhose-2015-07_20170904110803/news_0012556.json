Even if you’re just messing about with the kids’ plastic bow-and-arrow set in the garden, it’s hard not to imagine yourself as Robin Hood when you draw back that string. If you want to stop pretending and take up some proper archery, you’ll be joining the mini-boom the sport is currently enjoying. Many people were inspired by the 2012 Olympics, when Lord’s Cricket Ground became an iconic venue for archers. So what are the essentials you need to know? Where do I go? There are about 1,200 affiliated clubs across the UK. Visit www.archerygb.org to find your nearest one. There’s an ongoing initiative called Intro Archery offering six taster lessons to learn the basics of target archery (as opposed to field archery). Prices vary but expect to pay around £40 for the course. It’s an all-year sport – in winter you move indoors and shoot at smaller, closer targets. What about equipment? Most clubs will lend you some basic gear to get you started. There are three main types of bows – traditional, compound and the most common, the recurve. There’s a thriving second-hand market, but if you do buy new you’ll be looking at a starting price of around £50-£60 for your first basic recurve bow. Arrows vary greatly in price, but begin at a couple of pounds each. You’ll also need some protective accessories such as a wrist guard and a pouch to stop your fingers becoming sore – again, you can borrow these at first. What skills do I need? Archery is a great leveller, so both young and old, able and disabled can compete against each other. It’s a sport where the basics are easy to pick up, but perfecting them is another matter. You’ll need to be able to focus on a target which can be more than 70m (230ft) away, although it will be about 10m (33ft) away when you first begin. You’ll also need good concentration and the ability to clear your mind of everything before uncurling your fingers from that taut string and aiming at the inner gold circle on the target. Can I compete at it? Archery is very sociable and you can do it for fun or take part in one of the many regular competitions. Most clubs organise internal club events, and encourage their members to enter competitions further afield. Will it keep me fit? Regular archery will build up your upper body strength and core fitness. It’s said that archers of average weight can burn off between 100-200 calories per hour. But archery alone is never going to give you the same cardiovascular workout as running or cycling. Instead, all that calm, quiet time as you prepare to fire will act as a great stress buster. Until you completely miss your target, of course.
