Created by Patricia Caballero—who has a vast knowledge of the industry, having worked as a studio manager at Hunter & Gatti—All Sisters goes a step further on the sustainable fashion scene. Caballero has been working hard for months to achieve ethically created yet high-quality swimsuits.\nThe brand launched its first capsule collection with eight styles than can be mixed and matched. Designed for active and contemporary women and created with sustainable materials and ethical procedures, the label is respectful of the environment and people. With contemporary shapes and pattern cutting especially designed for water sports, All Sisters collections have been produced with the best recycled materials. “We believe that fashion and sustainability can work together,” said Caballero.\nAll Sisters pays tribute to surf culture, women’s sisterhood, and Mother Earth. Why a sustainable brand? “I think coherence is really important. I want to be responsible to the environment and society. The truth is that I couldn’t conceive of a brand in any other way, and I also think that all fashion companies should invest in a sustainable business model,” explained Caballero.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php", "http://www.allsisters.com/"], "published": "2015-07-15T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T00:31:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
