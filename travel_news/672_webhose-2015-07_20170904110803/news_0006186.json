However, of the airport’s total 1,480,000m2 space, only 2.3 per cent of it is affected, said the statement. \n\nMAB was responding to Tony Fernandes, AirAsia’s group CEO’s earlier remarks that the airport needed to be fixed. \n\n“We should have let the ground settle, fix it and then moved,” said Fernandes in a report by New Straits Times on July 28. \n\nIn the same report, Aireen Omar, CEO of AirAsia, had said: “It is a struggle to operate from klia2. The best thing is really to find a permanent solution that will address all the issues that we are facing. From what we understand, the issues will continue to be there for the next few years…maybe another 10 years or so.” \n\nBut MAB said it had received all required safety certifications prior to the opening of klia2, and that “a Joint Inspection Committee is the proper platform for the airport stakeholders to raise and resolve any operational issues including the update on the rectification works\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T15:31:14.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
