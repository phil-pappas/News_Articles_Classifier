Since kicking off his Triple Jam concert tour in Taipei last November, the Taiwanese singer-songwriter has been touring all over Asia (including Hong Kong, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Kuala Lumpur), and has plans to take his show to London and New York. Hsiao, who is currently working on his next release for the end of this year, will also hold his concert in Singapore next month at the Singapore Indoor Stadium. \nBut with all that globetrotting, it is somewhat unfortunate that the Mandopop star absolutely hates flying. “I’m really, really afraid of flying,” he said. “When I was very young, my mother had to go on a trip with a company. I knew she had to take an aeroplane, so I cried and asked her not to go. I wasn’t even supposed to be on the trip, and I cried so hard!” \nHsiao, who is also a mentor on Beijing TV’s reality singing competition, Duets, said he usually sleeps on flights so that he would feel less terrified. “I often stay up all night before I am supposed to fly, so I can sleep through the flight,” he said. “Who knew that I would end up treating airplanes like public transportation when I grew up?” \nQ: Do you go on vacation a lot? \nA: I don’t really go on holidays. When I have a few days off, I like to spend them at home, because I travel too often. But two years ago, over Chinese New Year, I went to Bali. It’s a place everyone has been to, though. I don’t really like to travel. \nQ: Who do you miss most when you travel? \nA: I miss my cats and dogs. They can’t fly with me, so I certainly miss them. \nQ: Have you done anything adventurous or dangerous in recent years then? \nA: When I was younger I used to take roller coasters, but I don’t dare to any more. I am really afraid of them now! \nQ: What do you look out for in a hotel room? \nA: I don’t look out for anything in particular, because I am not very picky about such things. \nQ: Are you one of those people who would take toiletries from hotel rooms? \nA: Yes I do! (Laughs) I take the shampoo, soap and toothbrushes. I take them home. Wait, they won’t sue me, right? \nQ: Do you take your pyjamas with you when you travel? \nA: Oh! I love my pyjamas. I received a set of pyjamas with long sleeves and long pants for free from an airline. They are very comfortable. \nQ: Do you pack your own bags when you travel? \nA: Yes, of course! Who else will help me pack, otherwise? I hate packing my bags, though. My cats and dogs (hate that) too; because when they see me taking my bags out, they know I won’t be coming home any time soon. \nJam Hsiao’s Triple Jam concert is on August 15 at the Singapore Indoor Stadium. Tickets from S$98 (RM273) to S$198 from Sports Hub Tix. — TODAY More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T05:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T10:45:51.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
