You can find more of her news and recommendations at arizona hiking.blogspot .com.\nSardine Trail #536 is an unsung hero within the Willow Springs Lake-area trail system. Over its 2.5-mile length, it acts as a recreational superhighway connecting the popular 7.6-mile Willow Springs Bike Loop with campsites and myriad routes debarking from four trailheads around Willow Springs Lake.\nHIKE: Walker Lake, Flagstaff\nThis shaded route is mostly used as a transit corridor by mountain bikers linking loop-trail hubs and by anglers toting poles to the lake's secluded coves. Well-marked by bright orange diamonds, the trail roughly parallels State Route 260. Although mild traffic noise is ever present, the fact that this path stays close to heavily traveled roads is a comfort to those looking to experience the woodlands and water of the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests without wandering too far from civilization.\nOne way to explore this trail is to begin at the Willow Springs trailhead. From the parking area, cross Forest Road 149 and pick up the trail heading east toward the lake. The hike twists though ponderosa pine forest with glimpses of water peeking through the trees. The trail makes many gooseneck turns that can be confusing, so be sure to spot the next orange blaze before moving on.\nDon't let the minor route-finding, towering green canopies and mountain breezes distract you from noticing the ospreys gliding on air currents and brilliant blue Stellar's jays squawking in the treetops.\nHIKE: Pole Knoll, Greer\nTwo rustic footbridges span drainages where moisture-loving wildflowers run amok among an understory of ferns and fragrant patches of clover. Beyond the first bridge, an optional short walk along anglers' paths leads to a cattail-choked finger cove surrounded by limestone ledges. At the 2-mile point, the trail meets the junction for the 7.6-mile Bike Loop and the Horse Trap trailhead. Tack on the Bike Loop for an 11.6-mile round-trip hike, or return the way you came to conclude an easy 4-mile walk in the forest.\nLength: 4 miles or 11.6 miles (as described here).\nRating: Easy-moderate.\nElevation: 7,045-7,623 feet (7,700 feet with Bike Loop).\nWhere: Willow Springs Trailhead. From the intersection of SR 87 and SR 260 in Payson, go 29.6 miles east on SR 260 to FR 149 near mile marker 283. Turn left and continue 0.4 mile to the trailhead on the left. Roads are paved.\nDetails: www.fs.usda.gov/asnf .", "external_links": ["http://www.fs.usda.gov/asnf"], "published": "2015-07-08T17:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T20:40:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
