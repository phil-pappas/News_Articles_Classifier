It is priced at HK$488 for 2 people. \nSavoury Afternoon Tea Jenny An, Director of Marketing Communications, The Langham, Hong Kong (left), and Michael Taylor of the Accidental Travel Writer pose with the Savoury Afternoon Tea with Wedgwood.

Queen Olives \"Gordal\" stuffed with orange and red vermouth; Raspberry and Rose Foie Gras Lollipops with almonds; Akagai Clam and Tuna Ceviche with tomato, cilantro and lime; King Crab with cucumber seafood roll and sour cream; 48-month aged acorn fed Iberico Belotta Ham with daiquiri-infused melon; Lobster Grisini with Marie Rose sauce and avocado; Balik-style Salmon with caviar and crème fraîche; and Boquerones and Anchovies with country bread topped with roasted bell peppers. \nThe 2nd course , which is served on a wooden board, comprises ... A savoury selection of bespoke English cheeses served with homemade jams and artisanal breads. \n“I am very excited to bring my own unique flair and create a composition of different flavour profiles as executive chef.,\" Chef Pedro says. \n\"I hope to continue elevating the dining scene at The Langham Hong Kong.” \nChef Pedro will overlook food operations at all of the hotel's Western restaurants: Artesian, The Bostonian, The Food Gallery, Main St. Deli, and Palm Court as well as in-room dining and the events catering department. \nExecutive Chef Kwong Wai-keung oversee's the hotel's Michelin-starred Cantonese restaurant, T'ang Court. \nChef's Bio \nChef Pedro was born in San Sebastian, Spain. With more than 20 years of experience in food and beverage, he was previously the Executive Chef at Paradores de Turismo Hotels and Resorts in Valencia, Spain, and has worked in such fine dining Spanish restaurants as Martin Berasategui (3 Michelin Stars), Quique Dacosta (3 Michelin Stars), and Kokotxa (1 Michelin Star). \nMore recently, Chef Pedro worked in Tokyo, Japan, under renowned Chef Yamamoto at RyuGin (3 Michelin Stars). \nMost recently, Chef Pedro was based at Zafran, a Spanish restaurant in SoHo on Hong Kong Island. \nAnd if there's one thing Chef Pedro has no use for, it is \"fusion\". \nWhen it comes to food, I assume, he agrees with Rudyard Kipling, who so famously said, \"West is East, West is West, and never the twain shall meet!\" \nAt least that is the conclusion I came to during a brief conversation with Chef Pedro following afternoon tea. \nComment and Analysis Queen Olives \"Gordal\" stuffed with orange and red vermouth, raspberry and Rose Foie Gras Lollipops with almonds, and King Crab with cucumber seafood roll and sour cream.

Since I prefer savoury flavours, the Savoury Afternoon Tea was more to my liking. \nThere was an interesting combination of flavours and textures. The King Crab with cucumber seafood roll and sour cream, the Iberico Ham with Daiquiri infused melon, and the Lobster Grisini with Marie Rose sauce and avocado were particularly yummy. \nI thought the raspberry and rose foie gras lollipops with almonds were more suitable to be consumed with something bubbly. Not to worry. You can order champagne by the glass. \nMy favourite was the wooden board presentation. Those pungent English cheeses paired with homemade fruit jams and artisanal breads were delightful. \nWhere 48-month aged acorn fed Iberico Belotta Ham with daiquiri-infused melon, Boquerones and Anchoves with country bread topped with roasted bell peppers, and Lobster Grisini with Marie Rose sauce and avocado .
