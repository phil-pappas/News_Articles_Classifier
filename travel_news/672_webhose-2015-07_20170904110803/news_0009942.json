(Deb Lindsey/For The Washington Post)\nJulia Child and her editor agreed on the title after much debate and exchanges of letters. (Jim Cooper/Associated Press) Let’s play a literary word association game.\nI say “Mastering the Art of . . . ,” you say: Soviet Cooking? Long-Range Shooting? Longarm Quilting? Chinese Cooking? Carving Melon Centerpieces? French Eating?\nIf you’re a classicist, and a cook, there is just one proper response: French Cooking.\nAnd depending on whom you ask, the proliferation of other possible answers is either a very good or very bad thing. The annals of book publishing are littered with titles employing the well-worn phrase popularized by “Mastering the Art of French Cooking,” the seminal cookbook by Julia Child, Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle whose first of two volumes came out in 1961.\nThe phrase’s use now spans many genres — all the above are, in fact, real titles — but perhaps none more prominently than cookbooks.\nJudith Jones, you edited “Mastering the Art of French Cooking.” Your thoughts, please?\n“I think a cookbook should have its own identity, its own title, its own meaningfulness,” the revered editor, now retired, says from her Vermont home. Rather than come up with something original, she adds, “All you’re doing is riding on a book that’s been successful.”\nJones admits to strong feelings on the topic. She doesn’t want to sound like a “sourpuss,” but we have an inkling she isn’t the only one who feels that way.\n[", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0394721780", "https://twitter.com/@BeckyKrystal"], "published": "2015-07-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T15:17:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
