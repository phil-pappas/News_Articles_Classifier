But thanks to its gloriously sandy beaches and world-class, child-friendly attractions, the emirate is just as alluring for kids as it is for those travelling without children. Although the winter months are Dubai's peak travel season, summer is also a wonderful time to visit. Prices are at their most affordable in July and August, with upgrades, add-ons and discounts to be found. To bag the best of these seasonal deals, it's worth booking with a specialist operator like Value Added Travel . The company knows Dubai inside out and can tailor-make any holiday for guaranteed family fun. The obvious spot to find family fun is the beach - and with a choice of both public and private beaches, the opportunities here are endless. As well as soft sand and warm, clear waters, all of Dubai's beaches have showers and shady spots (plus lifeguards and facilities) to ensure everybody stays cool. For aquatic fun beyond the beach, Dubai offers two of the world's top ten water parks. Both Wild Wadi and Aquaventure are famed for their rides and slides, whose highlights include the Jumeirah Sceirah, a daredevil water-slide with speeds of 50mph. Younger kids can feed the fish at The Lost Chambers Aquarium, while teens will be entertained for hours on the FlowRider surf simulators. With family life a backbone of Emirati society, kids are welcome everywhere in Dubai Value Added Travel advises families keen to maximise their budgets to stay at one of the beach hotels associated with one of Dubai's water parks. Access to Aquaventure and Wild Wadi is free for hotel guests, saving up to £93 per person. Guests can also make use of the hotels' private beach clubs. Elsewhere, there's family fun to be found in Dubai's many indoor attractions. Favourites include Sega Republic (a computer-game theme park), Ski Dubai (an indoor ski resort), KidZania (a grown-up world in miniature) and the brilliant Dubai Aquarium. Ever dynamic, this year sees Dubai add Wibit Water Park to its list of attractions, with Legoland Dubai to follow next year. With family life a backbone of Emirati society, kids are welcome everywhere in Dubai (it's also amongst the world's safest cities). Most hotels are extremely child-friendly, offering kids' clubs, babysitting and family dining. And with everything from self-catering to all-inclusive (and more properties opening all the time), Value Added Travel can match a hotel to each customer's budget and style. Dubai really comes into its own for family trips, pairing first-rate accommodation and brilliant beaches with all sorts of exciting experiences. From desert off-roading and whizzing down water-slides to skiing on snow, sea and sand, or meeting camels, a giant octopus or even a saltwater crocodile, a Dubai summer holiday has the wonderful distinction of offering family fun on an epic scale, without a hefty price tag to match.
