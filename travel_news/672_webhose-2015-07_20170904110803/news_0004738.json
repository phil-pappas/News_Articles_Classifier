(Photo: Jeremy Thompson /Flickr) \nThe popularity of Orlando as a summer destination for ride-hopping and waterslide-jumping shined through again today in TripAdvisor’s Travelers' Choice survey results : the Florida family-travel mecca places five of the six favorite amusement parks in the world, and three of the four favorite water parks in the U.S. \nIt’s not the Magic Kingdom that takes No. 1 in the survey, although it is the most visited amusement park in the world (with over 19 million visitors in 2014). That title goes to Universal’s Islands of Adventure , whose attractions include the Jurassic Park River Adventure, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, and The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man. \nRelated: New Theme Park Rides You’ll Definitely Want to Take the Family to \nDisney’s Magic Kingdom. (Courtesy: TripAdvisor) \nTripAdvisor created the rankings with an algorithm that calculates the quality and quantity of worldwide reviews over a 12-month period. \nOrlando swept the top 3 for world’s favorite amusement park, with the runner-up spot going to SeaWorld’s Discovery Cove (the 2014 winner), and No. 3 going to the Magic Kingdom. \nAs for the world’s favorite water park, that honor goes not to Orlando but to Siam Park in Tenerife, Spain. Opened in 2008, the Thai-themed park boasts the tallest manmade waves in the world (3 meters), and the Tower of Power with its 28-meter vertical drop. The sprawling park takes up 185,000 square meters overall, and it won TripAdvisor’s survey last year. \nTower of Power water slide at Siam Park.
