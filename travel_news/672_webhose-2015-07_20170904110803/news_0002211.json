Most airlines are helping with waiving cancellaton fees and some are giving accommodation for those who could not enter Bali.\" \n\n“We learnt of some problems with stranded passengers who did not have extra funds for extending their stay in hotels.” \n\nIndonesia Hotel and Restaurant Association Bali Chapter, had issued a circular letter to the industry, including travel companies, to waive the overstay charges for stranded passengers. \n\n“Unfortunately, we had received the notice a bit late and some clients had been charged,” Ardana said. \n\nNina Zen, regional director of sales and marketing, Swiss-Belhotel International said the over supply of rooms in Bali helped. \n\nGiving an example of her hotel in Seminyak: “We are running 65-68 per cent occupancy in our hotel in Seminyak, so we can still accommodate those who are stranded while still having rooms for the ones coming.” \n\nIn the mean time, Global Travel Media reported Jetstar and Virgin Australia were operating bigger aircraft and adding extra flights to rescue thousands of passengers today. Virgin is expected to fly about 2,000 passengers from Bali while Jetstar plans to operate 18 flights in and out of Bali, which includes 10 additional services.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T16:40:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
