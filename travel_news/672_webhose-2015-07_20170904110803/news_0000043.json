The campaign highlights the personal connections and moments that are possible thanks to US airlines. Through online videos and sharable graphics, the campaign will bring to life the impact that US airlines have every day and the benefits of going from “there” to being “here.” \n“Every day, 2.1 million passengers and nearly 50,000 tons of cargo travel on US airlines to get to wherever ‘here’ is for them. Whether it’s flying for a family gathering, a business meeting or getting an overnight delivery, US airlines make these moments possible,” said Jean Medina, A4A Senior Vice President of Communications. “This campaign celebrates the ‘you’re here!’ moments we all experience every day.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T23:58:14.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
