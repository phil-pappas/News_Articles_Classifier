White, courtesy of The Armory Show Noah Horowitz was appointed to the newly created role of Art Basel's director of Americas. Noah Horowitz has been appointed to the newly created role of director of the Americas for Art Basel and will oversee the show in Miami Beach. He joins Art Basel's executive committee in August and will report to Art Basel Director Marc Spiegler as Horowitz leads the Miami Beach fair, which drew 73,000 attendees to South Florida last year. The four-day affair, considered one of the world's premier international art show events for modern and contemporary works, is one of South Florida's major tourism attractions. The first day of Art Basel historically ranks among the top 10 revenue per available room nights for hotels in the region, according to the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau. During most days of the show, hotels are over 90 percent capacity . Before he joined Art Basel, Horowitz was the executive director of the Armory Show in New York since 2011. Before that, he was the director of the VIP Art Fair. He has a Ph.D. in art history from the Courtauld Institute of Art in London, frequently lectures on contemporary art and economics and has been published in The New York Times, Texte zur Kunst and The Art Newspaper . Horowitz told the The New York Times that he felt he had \"gone as far as he could with the Armory Show\" and was drawn to Art Basel's international reputation. \"Whereas the Armory is a New York institution, Basel is the only truly global institution in the contemporary-art space,‚Äù he told the New York Times. Spiegler is looking forward to observing how Horowitz will further develop the show in Miami Beach. \"With his strong background in running art fairs and his extensive network of contacts across every level of the art market, Noah has what it takes to play a vital role in this important region,\" Spiegler said in a prepared statement. Art Basel in Miami Beach begins Dec. 3-6. Its sister shows in Hong Kong and Basel, Switzerland will be March 24-26 and June 16-19, respectively. \nWant South Florida Travel   Related Content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T18:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T18:30:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
