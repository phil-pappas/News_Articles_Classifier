The new software for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch has been designed to streamline everyday tasks and become more intelligent and attuned to your individual needs. Signing up for the beta software programme with your Apple ID will allow you to test the system ahead of its expected full release in September, and report any bugs or errors as you may find. The first Apple products to ship with it are predicted to be the next generation of iPhones at the same time, going off previous release cycles. As the beta is not a finalised version of iOS 9 , some functions and actions may not work as expected and are subject to change ahead of the final rollout. The beta will receive periodic updates throughout the testing period. How to do it Sign up to try the free beta here . You'll be asked to provide your Apple ID and agree to a terms of service. From there, hit \"enroll your iOS device\" on the \"Getting Started\" section. Back up your current iOS data and then hit \"Download profile\", where you'll be prompted to install beta software. You have to do this part on an iOS device. Once you've done that, go to Settings > General > Software Update to try it. The new public beta for Mac OS X El Capitan is also now available to download and test for free. iOS 9 will see the introduction of new app News, which will replace Newsstand. News draws from respected news sources and publications to collate stories relevant to you, and will become increasingly refined the more you use it. Other updates include photo, map and url-adding functionality to Notes, a new transit feature for Apple Maps and the transformation of Passbook into Wallet, where UK customers will be able to store credit and debit cards for use with Apple Pay . Through iOS 9 the iPad takes on a new lease of life as a practical business-focussed tablet, with the introduction of simultaneous app-running feature Split View and Slide Over, which allows you to quickly dip into a second app, such as Twitter or your texts, without closing the window you’re currently working in. When iOS 9 is available as a full download, it will require significantly less space than previous updates. iOS 9 will require 1.3GB of space, compared to iOS 8's whopping 4.58GB, and Apple has introduced a clever method of temporarily deleting apps in order to make room for the update to ensure as many customers are running the latest version of the software as possible. Around 84 per cent of iOS devices are currently running iOS 8, while 14 per cent are using iOS 7. Only 2 per cent are continuing to run iOS 6 or previous iterations, according to Apple. iOS 9 will be compatible with the iPhone 4s upwards, the iPad 2 upwards, both iPad Airs, all three iPad minis and the 5th generation iPod touch. Hints and tips for downloading Ideally install iOS 9 on a secondary device. As it's not a full release, it might not have all the features you need. Backup your device before installing. Report any issues or bugs you find. Be aware the beta will receive periodic updates during the time you use it.
