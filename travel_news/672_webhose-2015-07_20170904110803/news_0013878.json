Incidents such as the recent earthquakes in both Borneo and Nepal may be remarkable in their rarity, but can still leave destinations suffering deep scars that deter tourists for lengthy periods. \nEven a hurricane in the Caribbean that claims no lives can leave a country dependent on tourism unable to host visitors, and slow the flow of money locals need to rebuild their lives. \nMeanwhile, when 275,000 people across 14 countries, many of which are jewels in the world’s tourism offering, were killed in the 2004 tsunami, those same countries have recovered while the people impacted have, for the most part, managed to rebuild their lives. \nSo the question remains not only about the morality of returning to a country   disaster, but exactly when it is best to do so.First, responsibletravel.com managing director Justin Francis believes that there is always a moral argument to support a return to a popular tourist destination. \nHe argues: “In places such as Nepal and Thailand, where tourism is such an important contributor to the economy, it becomes vital that we don’t let another tragedy follow swiftly on the heels of the first. \n“Many local tourism businesses will not have enough to weather an extended period of no income, and local people, and their families who depend on these small businesses, will suffer. \n“It is therefore important tourists don’t abandon Nepal, and continue to visit and support the country.” \n“In places such as Nepal and Thailand, where tourism is such an important contributor to the economy, it becomes vital that we don’t let another tragedy follow swiftly on the heels of the first” Justin Francis \nExodus managing director Pete Burrell agrees the trade must return to afflicted regions or countries as part of its responsibility to them, adding: “In places such as Nepal, the largest industry is tourism so it is absolutely key that they get tourism back in.” \nSense of normality Intrepid Travel co-founder and chief executive Darrell Wade also believes returning tourists help the local population not just because of the financial boost they bring but because of other, less tangible, benefits. \nHe says: “In the case of Nepal it is pretty clear cut. There’s so many people employed in tourism and it is a major deal there for the country. \n“Once the suggestion is there that it’s safe to go back, it is a really good thing to be promoting tourism as it brings a sense of normality for people there.” \nThe next biggest question is when operators should feel confident about returning to an afflicted destination. \nThe first milestone is the lifting by the Foreign Office of any travel advisories placed on countries in the wake of problems to ensure insurance is validated. \nBut even if the FCO has given the thumbs up, Wade argues it is vital operators listen to intelligence they can gather from partners on the ground and act on instinct if needs be. \n“Once the suggestion is there that it’s safe to go back, it is a really good thing to be promoting tourism as it brings a sense of normality for people there” Darrell Wade \nHe adds: “It is a difficult time to be honest. You can have a bit of a hunch that something might go wrong but you can’t really explain it. “Safety has got to be your number one priority.” \nAs a result, Wade has cancelled trips in the past to countries deemed safe by the authorities and despite the anger of customers ready to go. \nKuoni head of customer experience Darren Grahame-Betts agrees that while nothing can happen until the FCO’s say-so, he is not always content to trust it alone. \nHe adds: “Our prime source of information always comes from the FCO and if you feel it is necessary, you will put someone on the ground to inspect the infrastructure and the hotel product themselves. \n“There are times where we check up with the Federation of Tour Operators (FTO) to see what other members are doing. If there are other members in the destination we will collaborate with them.” \nNikki White, head of destinations and sustainability at Abta, says that the destinations themselves can help in this role, adding: “The destination has to be very cognisant and give accurate information to the tour operators as to what they can provide and the infrastructure available.” \nAnd she argues that it is not enough that returning tourists should be the only beneficiaries of restored services and utilities. \nBack to basics White says: “The local population’s ability to have access to fresh water is a basic criteria and you have to be careful that you don’t end up with a disproportionate balance of shipping things in for the tourists when the locals don’t have access to the basics. \n“We’ve seen that in the past where they’ve shipped in water for the tourists and there’s nothing for the locals.” \nWhite also believes returning operators must be mindful of the fact locals must also be given time to grieve. \n“The destination has to be very cognisant and give accurate information to the tour operators as to what they can provide and the infrastructure available” Nikki White \nShe adds: “If they are dealing with grief, have you given them enough time to grieve before they are getting back to work? \n“It is about not going too quickly, so people who have lost whole families or are trying to get back on their feet can do so. \n“It is about the balance of understanding the situation that people find themselves in. Some people want to get back to work and providing that structure can help them, but for others it is not right.” \nWhite also argues attempts to bring travellers back too quickly can also backfire on the customer. \n“People try and get tourists back in and they end up giving them disposable plates and cutlery, and they’re staying in a five-star property,” she says. \n“You have to be mindful of the customer experience; there’s no point rushing back in the tourists and they end up saying ‘I didn’t like the country as it wasn’t what I expected’.” \nGrahame-Betts agrees, adding: “We need to know if it is safe and if you can deliver what you have promised to your customers. \n“We don’t just go back [to the customers] and say it is hunky dory, we go back with lots of information and if we’ve got pictures we show them the images.” \nBut he is also aware of the need to balance the customer’s interests with the operator’s own commercial interests. \n“We book countries as soon as the FCO says it is safe, but if you have customers that are just not that comfortable with it then you don’t force them into the destinations,” he adds. \n“With the number of destinations we feature, it has not been too hard, as we have got the flexibility of switching into another area if needs be for a while.” \n“We book countries as soon as the FCO says it is safe, but if you have customers that are just not that comfortable with it then you don’t force them into the destinations” Darren Grahame-Betts \nBurrell believes that for Intrepid’s more adventurous customers, they are often prepared to overlook some discomfort and, following the Nepal earthquake, says the operator has had more people ringing saying they’re not cancelling their trips than those who have cancelled. \nDo the right thing Francis believes that the final part of the morality trap can be avoided by ensuring tourists do the right thing on their return to a destination, saying: “By travelling with responsible tour operators and using local guides and locally-owned accommodations and restaurants, tourists can help ensure that their trip benefits the local people that need it most.” \nBurrell agrees, although he believes every traveller can make a difference, no matter how they choose to visit a country, which is seeking to find its feet again   disaster. \n“Even staying in a five-star hotel, the money does trickle down as they employ lots of staff,” he says. “But the way we do it, by staying with local communities, we are putting money straight back into the hands of the people who need it.” \nIntrepid Travel chief executive Darrell Wade has just returned from a four-day inspection trip of Nepal.
