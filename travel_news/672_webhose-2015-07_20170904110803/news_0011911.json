They’re possibly even as exasperated as I am. I doubt it will make them feel any calmer, then, to know about a particularly troublesome motorway service station on my doorstep. My police officers are regularly called away from their jobs protecting the citizens of Surrey and sent to the M25 at Cobham services, where they have to run around mopping up hordes of illegal migrants . In the past few months alone, Surrey Police have caught 156 people piling out of lorries as their drivers stop for diesel or a coffee. Recently, in Redhill, we had another 16 go on the run in an industrial park. No one knows how many we missed. The last time they were sent to Cobham, police caught 20. These operations take out virtually half of Surrey’s 999 response capability and can tie up our nine prisoner vans for hours, as well the helicopter and all the dogs we can spare, to say nothing of jamming up the county’s cells. The migrants have become a serious threat to our residents: we can’t respond to their needs or patrol adequately. Virtually no exports are now able to leave through our busiest port, they are stuck on the M20. Moreover, many businesses in Britain which depend on imports are at a standstill Their relatively easy arrival flags up some serious weaknesses in our borders. In the search for human cargo we scan lorries for carbon dioxiode - or human breath; we use sniffer dogs and infra-red heat detectors, but even so we are clearly missing thousands of people. Don’t think about the fact that if so many people can slip through, so can properly wrapped weapons and explosives, which none of our systems can detect. But let’s leave aside, for the moment, the ongoing threat of terrorists smuggling weaponry into the country, and the persistence of drug traffickers bringing in heroin or cocaine, as well as those women being trafficked for sex slavery. Let’s focus, instead, on the immediate economic threat posed by the current borders debacle. Virtually no exports are now able to leave through our busiest port, they are stuck on the M20. Moreover, many businesses in Britain which depend on imports are at a standstill. • Migrant situation reaches fever pitch Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of people are now here working illegally, reducing the Chancellor’s ability to collect income tax and National Insurance Contributions. All of these unfortunate migrants will go on to impose a burden on the NHS, police and education services. It’s a perfect model of how the failure to control borders can damage the economy and safety too. Frankly, its a scandal. Rightly, we’re fighting with France to get the French authorities to secure their side of the Tunnel. But who knows how long it might take to get them to step up as they should. A quick fix would be to ask the military to do what they did for us at the Olympics and during the floods: move in where the failure of others leaves no other option. In this case, it couldn’t be easier. Shornecliffe barracks in Folkestone is the base for the 700 soldiers of 2nd Royal Gurkha Rifles. Folkestone is where the Channel Tunnel emerges - I’m sure the Home Secretary must know this already. So why not ask a few Gurkhas to stroll up the hill and help the Border Agency search incoming lorries? More could be sent through the tunnel to support Border Agency staff on the French side. Would it really be that much trouble to mobilise them? When it comes to enforcing the law, I suspect that Gurkhas might be made of slightly sterner stuff than gendarmes. Gurkha soldiers on parade in London Meanwhile, it’s not difficult to work out where the illegal migrants, terrorists and traffickers are going to target next, particularly if things are made difficult in Dover and Folkestone. The next avenue of attack will be via our other big ports: Portsmouth, Newhaven or Plymouth. So while we consider that alarming news, here’s another quick fix: there are a lot of sailors in Portsmouth and Commandos in Plymouth. I’m sure they’d help out for a few days - the military always does. Defence of the realm is the Government’s primary duty. But the Government has not yet realised that to tackle desperate people, we may need to take desperate measures. @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T22:43:00.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
