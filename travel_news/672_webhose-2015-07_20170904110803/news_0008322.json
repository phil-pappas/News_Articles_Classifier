Organised by the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB), the event will consist of cycling races and activities, and a carnival.\nAmong the races are criterium races recognised by the Union Cycliste Internationale, which will be staged in Tsim Sha Tsui, with professional cyclists hailing from around the world taking part. There will also be races of different levels for cycling fans. These races will cover different parts of Hong Kong, including the 35 km Challenge Ride, which will see the iconic Tsing Ma Bridge opened for the first time for a cycling event and also allow participants to cycle around the magnificent International Commerce Centre (ICC), the tallest building in Hong Kong.\nDr Peter Lam, Chairman of the HKTB, said: “The sport of cycling has caught on in Hong Kong in recent years, with many cyclists from the city earning international recognition. By staging the large-scale Cyclothon, the HKTB wants to reinforce Hong Kong’s standing as Asia’s events capital and gain additional international exposure for the city. In the long run, we hope to expand the scale of the event so that it will become a major annual event in the Pearl River Delta region when the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge is completed.”\nDr Lam continued: “The first edition of the Cyclothon covers major roads in Hong Kong. I would like to take this opportunity to express our sincerest gratitude for the support of various Government departments, the Cycling Association of Hong Kong, China Ltd, and all our sponsors and supporting organisations, especially Sun Hung Kai Properties (SHKP), the title sponsor and charity sponsor, and The Bank of East Asia Limited, the event’s major sponsor.”\nSHKP Chairman and Managing Director Dr Raymond Kwok said: “The Group will put its commitment to healthy, sustainable living into practice as well as encourage the public to exercise for a good cause through its title and charity sponsorships of the first Hong Kong Cyclothon. The sporting event is in a sense an initiative that helps inspire people to care for those in need while taking pleasure in cycling. In addition, the fourth ‘SHKP Vertical Run for Charity – Race to Hong Kong ICC’ which will be held in late 2015 encourages a wider culture of working out, so that the people of Hong Kong will benefit from the positive energy that exercise brings into life. Cycling is suitable for people of all ages.\nParents wanting to share a good time with children can join the family fun ride of\nthe Hong Kong Cyclothon.”\nIn keeping with its belief in “Building Homes with Heart”, the Group organises,\nsupports and sponsors community events that encourage the public to exercise\nfor good health and worthy causes. The Hong Kong Cyclothon allows people to\nride safely through major thoroughfares while appreciate the landmarks of the\ncity, including the Hong Kong Cultural Centre, International Commerce Centre –\nthe tallest building in Hong Kong – and Tsing Ma Bridge. The Group pledges to\nmake additional donations to demonstrate the spirit of giving.\nThere are a total of eight cycling categories in the “Sun Hung Kai Properties\nHong Kong Cyclothon”, which will be conducted over a two-day period. On the\nfirst day (Saturday, 10 October), the following four criterium races will be held in\nEast Tsim Sha Tsui in the evening. Members of the public are welcome to enjoy\nthe races.\nSource:- Hong Kong Tourism Board\nTags: Hong Kong Tourism Board", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T12:41:42.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
