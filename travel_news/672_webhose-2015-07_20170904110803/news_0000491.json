Photographer's Note \nAn essential element of Curitiba is the Feira do Largo da Ordem, or Largo da Ordem Street Fair. The Largo da Ordem Street Fair is an open event which takes place every Sunday from 9am to 2pm in the historic center of the city and occupies several blocks and having almost 1 km of extension. The first edition of the fair occurred in 1973 without an official organization. In that period it was realized mostly by members of the hippie community who sold their crafts. Over time, the number of exhibitors and craftsmen increased, as the frequency of locals and tourists, making the fair one of the attractions of Curitiba. With the fair growth the organization and administration passed to the city hall. Besides crafts and clothing you will find at the fair: typical food, toys, antiques, old vinyl records and cultural performances. All surrounded by old buildings includings historical ones and churchs.
