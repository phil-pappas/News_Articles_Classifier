You may have been through the wait for GCSE results, but A-level results are a completely different kettle of fish. As much as you may have reminded your student that, in the long run, their A-level results won't matter, your confidence in this belief will wane as the day gets closer. • Download the Telegraph's Clearing app for iPhone and Android With a possible university place, apprenticeship or job at stake, it can seem like an awful lot rides on getting the right results. So how do you go about calming a nervous teenager when you're trying to disguise the fact that you barely slept a wink? How do you rein in the urge to chivvy your student out of bed and into school, and then resist the compulsion to call before they've had a chance to open the envelope? As much as it might be an obvious thing to say, remembering that it's their day is a good place to start. The last thing anyone needs when they are collecting their results is the pressure of dealing with an excitable parent, standing on the sidelines – or worse – looking over their shoulder, camera in hand. While it may be hard to hold back, there are ways you can be helpful on August 13. One of these is knowing the timings of the day, the other is being familiar with the next steps so you can offer assistance should it be required. August 12: The day before It's worth giving some thought to the possible outcomes of Results Day. Leo Winkley, headmaster of St Peter's School, York, advises parents to write a letter to children before the day, to give them regardless of their results. Try and take students' minds off the impending event. If they are not out with friends, try and do something as a family and keep the conversation away from Results Day 'what-ifs'. If you do have to discuss the next day, keep it short, reassuring and practical. There's not much you can actively do until the evening, so quickly run over the 'Plan B' and then leave it there. Make sure they know how proud you are either way, as a lot of self-inflicted pressure can come from not wanting to let parents down. Ucas Clearing opens at 6pm on August 12 August 12: The evening before Ucas Clearing opens at 6pm this evening. Clearing is the process by which students who have not achieved their required grades are able to search for places at universities who still have spaces available. While your child won't be able to apply, they will be able to go online and see which courses have vacancies. Listings will be available via The Telegraph , via the free iPhone and Android Clearing app, and via the Ucas website. If your son or daughter is worried about their results, it might be worth suggesting that they have a quick look through and note down any courses they like the look of. Doing something proactive can help to alleviate any worries, and it could also mean they have a realistic Plan B they are happy with. Check out our guide to Clearing research to make sure you are asking all the right questions before Results Day. Furthermore, make sure you know exactly what is required of you on the day. Let your student know that you will be ready to help should they need it, but equally, that you won't interfere if they don't want you to. Double check what time they want to be in school or college to collect their results, whether they want a lift there and whether they expect you to hang around afterwards. Be aware that plans are likely to change on the day, so don't plan a celebratory family meal unless you're sure there won't be an impromptu Results Day party they want to attend instead. August 13: The morning of Results Day Ucas Track goes live at 8am in the morning. Sixth formers will be able to see whether they have got into the university of their choice, or whether they have been accepted at their insurance choice instead. They will not, however, be able to see their exact qualifications – they will need to go and pick these up from school or college. It's important that you do this, because they will need to provide their grades if they are entered into Clearing. Equally, if your child has done better than expected, they may want to look at alternative universities via Adjustment. Read our guide to Adjustment to make sure you know the process back to front. Students should look through and note down any courses they like the look of in Clearing On Results Day: Clearing On the day itself, if your son or daughter has been entered into Clearing, you should be aware that the process can take quite a while to get through, so it's best not to have anything planned for the next couple of days. Once they have got over the shock of missing their required grades, sixth formers will need access to the Internet in order to begin their research. They may also need an occasional voice of reason; Clearing can be stressful, but it can – as our numerous case studies have proved – be a very positive experience in the end, one which delivers a better outcome for the student . Having looked through the available courses, your child will then need to call the Clearing line of the universities they like the look of – the number will be evident on our app and via our hub. Someone in admissions will then talk your student through the course, and will likely ask a few interview-style questions over the phone. Having a quick look over the personal statement before the call can help with answers. It might sound obvious but do not be tempted to make the call yourself – the admissions tutor will need to speak to your son or daughter in person, and making the call as a parent does not reflect well on the prospective student. Once your child has been made a verbal offer over the phone, they will be able to enter the new course details into Track from 5pm on August 13. They will also need to update their details online with Student Finance England, once their application has been accepted. On Results Day: Etiquette Be prepared to be wrong. You may think the grades are great, but your teen may not think so. Almost every reaction you give could provoke an angry response, so just try and read the situation and be prepared to make some quick emotion changes. But don't go over the top. Being too keen on Results Day is almost as bad as showing no interest whatsoever. While everyone loves a proud parent, there's a big difference between shedding a slight tear and broadcasting the grades to anyone who will listen, including the local press. Equally, don't be nonchalant if your child is happy with their results. Keep your phone with you if you aren't with them at school, and be happy – even if you thought they could have done better (chances are they may be thinking the same). If all is good, it's time to celebrate and prepare for the next stage! If all is not well, be sure to talk to the school first. As Leo Winkley says: \"Don't go it alone. [The school] have been through every Results Day scenario before and can work unemotionally and supportively to plan the next moves.\" But above all else, be the calm in the Results Day storm. Dos and Don'ts for parents Do tell your teenage how proud you are before the day Do be available to help out should your student need it Do keep your phone with you at all times Do make sure you know what you are talking about Don't hover at school, unless your child wants you to be there Don't brag to other parents or make grades known unless authorised Don't try and take over if the worst happens; be there if you are needed • Step-by-step guide to A-level Results Day • Step-by-step guide to Clearing • Step-by-step guide to Adjustment • Download the Telegraph's Clearing app for iPhone and Android telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T09:38:05.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
