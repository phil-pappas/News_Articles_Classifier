Though the Polish national airline's launch of Dreamliner nonstop service between Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and Warsaw in 2013 got off to a very rocky start — thanks largely to early problems with the Dreamliner batteries — LOT now has nothing but kind things to say about the still relatively new airplane and its impact on LOT's improving finances. \"Connections operated by the Dreamliner are the most profitable part of our business,\" said LOT CEO Sebastian Mikosz . And passengers flying between Chicago and Warsaw on LOT Dreamliners will have more opportunities to connect to other LOT routes from Warsaw starting in the winter of 2016. LOT announced this week it will increase its winter season frequency between Chicago and Warsaw from five flights a week to daily service in 2016. That will match the daily frequency LOT currently offers between the two cities during the peak summer and fall travel seasons. The two added Chicago-Warsaw flights a week on the Dreamliner are part of LOT's new long-term plan to make the airline's Warsaw hub a huge draw for American business and leisure travelers looking to fly onward to other cities in Eastern Europe or to Asia, where LOT is starting to make inroads with its fleet of Dreamliners. In conjunction with adding more flights between Chicago and Warsaw, LOT announced plans to add new nonstops between Warsaw and three major Asian cities, Bangkok, Seoul and Tokyo. Added LOT CEO Mikosz: \"Opening new long-haul destinations is essential for our development, which is why we will launch them as quickly as possible.\" Warsaw-Tokyo service begins on Jan. 13, 2016,. \nWant Chicago Media & Marketing   Industries", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T21:22:54.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
