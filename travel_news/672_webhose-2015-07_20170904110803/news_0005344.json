Loisaba Wilderness \nOne of my favorite things to do on safari is sleep under the stars . Obviously you have to be careful when you do this, or you may find your toes being nibbled on by a hyena or worse. One of my most memorable camping experiences was while canoeing down the Zambezi in Zimbabwe . We strung up some mosquito nets over camp beds on some islands in the middle of the river, and enjoyed the most beautiful full moon with lion roaring in the distance. The lack of light pollution in Africa's best safari destinations , makes for an unbelievable starry show . \nWhen you sleep-out, make sure you know you're safe from predators, or you are in the company of a qualified guide. Always have a mosquito net above you, and generally it's better to sleep off the ground on some platform to avoid scorpions and snakes from seeking a little warmth during the night. \nLuckily, many of Africa's great safari lodges offer guests a \"star bed\" option. Below are some of my favorites. Make sure to ask your safari consultant about them when you book a safari. \nMy favorite \"star-beds\" on safari ... \nBaines Camp - Set deep in the heart of the Okavango Delta allows you to roll your bed on to your own private deck when the nights are clear. A gorgeous way to spend each night and very relaxing after a \"star bath\" where they fill giant copper tubs up for guests to soak the safari dust away. \nLion Sands River Lodge - Spend the night at Chalkley Tree-House in South Africa's Sabi Sands reserve, high above the grazing elephants. \nLoisaba - Take a guided walk with Maasai warriors from the main camps to one of two star bed options, and spend the night enjoying the breathtaking splendor of Kenya's Laikipia region. \nKalahari Plains - All the en-suite rooms here have a roof-top access to enjoy the stunning night sky of Botswana's Kalahari Desert. \nLittle Ku lala - Gaze up from the roof at one of only 8 designated International Dark Sky reserves in the world. \nThe Hide - Beautiful sunsets and starry nights in the heart of Zimbabwe 's Hwange Game Park are yours alone at the \"Dove's Nest\". A wonderful open tree-house perched on the edge of a wildlife filled valley. \nNkwichi StarBed - Enjoy your own beach paradise under the gorgeous Malawi skies, while listening to the gentle Lake lapping on the beach. The perfect night out! \nIf you want more than just one night out, I would also recommend fly-camping for a few nights. With just a simple camp bed and mosquito net, it's the ultimate safari experience without the frills. Make sure you do this with a reputable company and have good guides! \nThings to Consider When Sleeping Out \nThe option of sleeping out in the open can always be requested, but never guaranteed because of 2 main factors: The weather - mosquito nets are not great at keeping out the rain Predators - A guard will always be posted nearby, but if lions or other big predators are known to be active in the area, the camp manager may decide it is not safe to sleep out. \nPrefer to enjoy your meals Al Fresco Instead? \nIf spending a night out is not your cup of tea, there are plenty of opportunities to sit under the open skies and enjoy a meal... and perhaps a glass of wine or three. Boma Dinners - popular in southern Africa, dining under the stars with local entertainment and delicious roasting meats, is just the way to end an exciting day on safari. Bush Breakfasts - The best bush breakfast is the one enjoyed after a bolloon ride over the East African Plains. But it's also possible to enjoy a private bush breakfast at many camps. Dinner on the water - Cruise down the Zambezi for dinner and drinks on the romantic Ra Ikane, or enjoy lunch on a pontoon at Chiawa camp. Boxed Lunches - popular in east Africa for those full day game drives, boxed lunches under an acacia tree taste so good!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T03:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T05:54:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
