But exactly what is the attraction?\nMelissa James is one of many experiencing the benefits of colouring-in as an adult and she says there’s one simple reason.\n“As a chronic anxiety sufferer, I find it hard to focus on a lot of activities for a long time. With colouring, I find it keeps me focused, calm, interested and is actually quite enjoyable. It keeps my mind still and my hands busy, and being a lousy artist provides me with a way to express my creativity in a positive way,” she said.\nIt’s easy to see why the beautiful books are taking off.

In an interactive exhibit adults and children alike can swim the ocean of clear plastic balls used to create an inside beach in the building’s Great Hall. There are even beach chairs and drinks available. The exhibit has been included after the huge success of an indoor maze last July. The designers Snarkitecture wanted to bring a slice of summer and a “memorable landscape” to the city. A giant ball pit will no doubt be memorable for all the adults as it takes them back to childhood in an instant.\nThe adult ball pit in the National Building Museum in Washington DC.

Trampolining is not only fun and relaxing but it’s also a fantastic way to stay fit.\nTrampolines aren’t just for kids anymore.

Swimming for leisure offers many benefits to adults. You don’t have to swim laps, even jumping in with the kids and starting a water fight can be great fun for all.\n● Park play and swinging on swings: For most of us a trip to the park is an obligatory task we give in to after repetitive begging from our children, but time spent enjoying leisurely relaxing in a park can be beneficial for people of all ages. Therese Orton agrees. “When I started going to the park I realised that life didn’t have to be so busy. It gives you a chance to take your time and appreciate all that is around you. Things like swinging on the swing and walking on the balance beam make you remember the child within,” she said.\n● Bike riding: Learning to ride a bike is a rite of passage for many as children but once we become adults we often forget the joys of riding along the lakes or down the streets with the breeze on our faces. Bike stores now stock bikes purely made for cruising and leisure giving us no excuse not to hit the track.\nIt’s easy to feel like a kid again when you jump on your bike.

At 28, Megan Thompson did just that and is already reaping the benefits. “I started cello lessons purely because there is no one to say ‘no’ to me. I love accomplishing the little tasks my teacher gives me,” she said.\nRemember how good Derwent pencils were?!
