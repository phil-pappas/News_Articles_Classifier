A.) is delighted to launch a special fare offer of over 50% off for its customers travelling from New Delhi to London-Heathrow on the new aircraft in World Traveller (economy). Customers can take advantage of the attractive discount for the sale period 14 July 2015 – 16 July 2015 and outbound travel period 25 October 2015 – 31 December 2015.\nMoran Birger, British Airways’ Regional Commercial Manager, South Asia said, “We, at British Airways, are constantly innovating and adding more to our offerings, keeping the customer’s comfort and convenience at the heart of our decision making. India is the second largest international market for us after the U.S. and we are committed to providing the very best to our customers, adding further value to their travel experience with us.\n“We welcome our customers from Delhi to experience a whole new level of comfort and luxury and do hope they enjoy the benefits of our new aircraft from the city,” he added.\nThe 787-9, the first of which is due to arrive with British Airways in September, is 20ft longer that its 787-8 predecessor (of which the airline has eight), so as well as offering World Traveller (economy), World Traveller Plus (premium economy) and Club World (business class), there’s also room for a new First class cabin – a first for the airline’s 787 fleet.\nThe First cabin has just eight seats in comparison to the 14 seats* available on other British Airways long-haul aircraft, giving even more exclusivity and privacy to customers.Created specifically for the Boeing 787-9, the new First suites have been painstakingly designed based on feedback from First customers, to put comfort at the heart of the experience and make the very best use of the more intimate space.\nThe suites now include four new storage areas. A new ottoman next to the adjustable footstool has enough room for shoes, handbags and personal items, while the personal suiter for jackets and coats is now accessible without the customer having to move from their seat.\nA new locker positioned at eye-level is perfect for smaller personal effects such as tablets, spectacles, passport and wash-bags. A handy mirror has also been fitted to the inside of the locker door for personal grooming.Customers who need to charge any devices can now do so in a discreet stowage area next to their armrest. Great attention to detail has also been paid to how the customer uses their suite, with each function being controlled by simple, intuitive touch.\nThe seat and in-flight entertainment console has been updated with a new handset, much like a smartphone, integrated into the seat from which travellers can control their in-flight entertainment. During flight, the handset can be docked so that customers are also able to watch one item, such as the moving map, on the handset and another, such as a film, on the 23inch fixed screen. This also means travellers will be able to enjoy gate-to-gate entertainment, without having to stow their television for take-off and landing.\nThe smart ‘jog-dial’, that previously controlled the seat’s recline, now manages five additional functions including the headrest and lumbar inflate and a ‘global’ lighting control to set both ambient and reading lighting.The new First cabin on the Boeing 787-9 was developed by Forpeople, London, working together with the airlines’ in-house teams and leading British suppliers, including Prototrim, which developed the high quality soft leather and fabric trim within the suite and London based Pritchard Themis who worked on the suite and cabin lighting.\nSource:-British Airways\nRelated Posts Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building BOC Aviation Marks 20th Year With Record Net Profit in 2013 Austrian Airlines Financial Results as at 30 September 2013: Positive result gives optimism for break-even in 2013 Lufthansa Group increases result in core business Virgin airline named top u.s. airline in conde nast traveler’s 2013 readers’ choice awards", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T10:08:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
