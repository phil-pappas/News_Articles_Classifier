(Photo: Glynnis MacNicol) \nOne late afternoon this summer, I found myself driving along the Bonneville Salt Flats during my weeklong sojourn across America. \nIt’s rare for a travel editor to be caught completely off-guard. When it comes to exotic and beautiful destinations, we like to think we know it all. But I knew next to nothing about the flats before I happened upon them, west of Salt Lake City on the Utah-Nevada border. \nRelated: A State-by-State Guide to America’s Natural Wonders \nPerhaps the element of surprise was part of the reason I was so blown away by the incongruous landscape. \nImagine a pristine white plain, the sun shining brilliantly off its shiny surface, stretching far into the distance and culminating in magnificent rocky mountain peaks. There’s an ethereal otherworldly feel as you wander out onto the crunchy salt. \nOn incredibly hot days, heat waves can rise into the air and create mirages that dance across the salty desert. I didn’t see anything but a few tourists and their Chihuahua, which was quickly covered in a salty layer of dust that made it resemble a very angry poodle. \nWhen the flats are covered in a fine layer of water, they look like a vast underwater desert.

Since 1914 they have been a popular site for car racing, due to the salt’s typically pristine surface that allows racers to achieve astronomical speeds of up to 400 mph. \nFive major land-speed events take place at the flats each year in mid-August for the Bonneville Speed Week. But this year the events were canceled for the second year in a row, according to the Associated Press : \nWet weather has forced the cancellation of Speed Week for the second straight year and revived a debate about whether nearby mining is depleting the Bonneville Salt Flats of their precious resource. Racers say they’ve worried for decades that mining is draining an aquifer that helps replenish the flats each year, leaving smaller amounts of the smooth, hard salt that makes for a nearly glass-like surface for cars hurtling across the landscape. …“The main international racetrack used to be 13 miles in length,” said Stuart Gosswein with Save the Salt, a group of race-aficionados that has raised the alarm. “Now we can’t even find 7 miles.” \nSleek aerodynamic vehicles perform best on the flats.

The Salt Lake Tribune reported last month that the salt crust was, on average, 2 to 3 feet thick a little over 50 years ago. These days the crust is barely two inches thick, and beneath it lies a sludgy, almost quicksand-like mud that could prove dangerous for both drivers and visitors who walk out onto the flats. \nRelated: 7 Natural Wonders You Must See Before You Die \nThe shrinking flats are distressing for racers, to be sure, but also for the general public who want to take in the natural beauty of the flats. This area plays second and third fiddle to Utah’s flashier natural wonders — Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon, and the Arches, but it is no less magnificent. \nRelated: This Amazing Utah Canyon Hike Comes With a Rescue Dog \nThe flats are a place of wonder and a must-see before they disappear. \nCars are not permitted to drive willy-nilly over the flats, but you can walk out on them. The best spot for visitors to stop and take pictures is a rest stop on I-80, 10 miles east of the very small town of Wendover. \nThe stop caters to tourists looking to romp around in the salt. It even has a water spray station to clean off your shoes. \nVisitors are not allowed to sleep overnight on the flats, but they can camp out in surrounding public and private campgrounds. \nThis just might be the perfect place to take a selfie. No one will believe you are in Utah. (Photo: Jo Piazza) \nLet Yahoo Travel inspire you every day.
