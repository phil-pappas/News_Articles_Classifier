You’re stuck at your desk and the day seems to be going on forever. Your mind starts to wander — at first to “anywhere but here,” but then to exotic, faraway lands where your everyday problems and stress melt in the presence of true paradise. You want to go to there, and we want to go with you. Every day at 3 p.m. Eastern, we’ll send you a picture of the place we at Yahoo Travel are daydreaming about so we can all take that mental vacation together.

With all the excitement this week surrounding the first ever up-close photos of Pluto (who will always be a planet in our hearts), we’ve never been more fascinated with the nighttime sky and the mysteries it holds. We’re dreaming of pulling out our star guides, grabbing our telescope, and packing a sleeping bag to go camp underneath the stars and Lake Rotoroa is the perfect spot to do so. Located in Nelson Lakes National Park, there’s plenty of outdoor fun to be had during the daylight hours including hiking, fishing, mountain biking, and kayaking. Once the sun goes down, it’s all about those stars! We could spend hours lying out on this jetty, watching the night sky, and pondering the incredible immensity of the universe.
