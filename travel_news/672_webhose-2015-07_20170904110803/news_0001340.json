Dysbiosis has been linked to many conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes.\nChoudhry and colleagues examined fecal samples from four severely burned patients who were treated in the Burn Center of Loyola University Medical Center.\nThe samples were taken 5 to 17 days after the burn injuries occurred. The microbiomes of these patients were compared with the microbiomes of a control group of eight patients who had suffered only minor burns.\nIn the severely burned patients, Enterobacteriaceae accounted for an average of 31.9 per cent of bacteria in the gut microbiome.\nBy comparison, Enterobacteriaceae accounted for only 0.5 per cent of the microbiome in patients who had suffered minor burns. Enterobacteriaceae is a family of bacteria that includes pathological bacteria such as E coli and Salmonella.\nChoudhry said such imbalances of bacteria may contribute to sepsis or other infectious complications that cause 75 per cent of all deaths in patients with severe burns.\nThe imbalance could compromise the walls of the gastrointestinal tract, enabling harmful bacteria to leak out of the gut and into the bloodstream.\nThe study is published in the journal PLOS ONE.\n 10:56 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T18:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T15:02:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
