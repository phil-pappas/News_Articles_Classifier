It is a constant balancing act, but there is now a solution to keep everybody happy thanks to a new partnership between Four Seasons Resort Bali at Jimbaran Bay and Tropicsurf to offer bespoke surfing holidays in Bali.\nWith a strategic location at the Resort’s Coconut Grove on Jimbaran Beach, Tropicsurf’s Ticket to Ride program caters for all levels – beginner through advanced – and provides convenient access to the island’s best breaks, all while enjoying the authentic Balinese culture and world-class service of Four Seasons Jimbaran Bay. For beginners and longboarders, the gentle beach break directly off the Coconut Grove is the perfect learning ground, and Tropicsurf’s unique coaching methodology provides personalised guidance for a maximum of four people per class. Experienced surfers can take advantage of Tropicsurf’s boat-to-surf “Airports,” just 10 minutes’ boat ride away, or the Uluwatu peninsula, or take a 20-minute road trip to Nusa Dua and Sanur.\nHurley-sponsored professional surfer Jay Phillips said the Tropicsurf program at Four Seasons Jimbaran Bay offers “the experience of a lifetime.” Phillips is based on the Gold Coast, Australia, and travelled to Bali with his wife and three children. “You’ve got all surf breaks at your fingertips right here in the Bay,” he said. “I know my daughter’s in safe hands surfing perfect little waves at Tora Tora or on the shore break right in front of Sundara, and my wife’s having the time of her life at the Resort while I get some quality waves as well. It’s been a dream holiday.”\nWhile Tropicsurf enables surfers avoid the crowds and pick the best waves to get the most of their time in the water, any non-surfers can immerse in the Resort’s tranquil beach-front location and authentic experiences. Comprising seven living “villages,” the 156 villas – each with indoor and outdoor living pavilions, shower garden and picturesque pool – cascade down 14 hectares of hilly headland and tropical water gardens dotted with hundreds of statues and shrines. Guests can go on a Temple Tour and even receive a traditional seawater blessing by the resident Mangku (priest), embark on a culinary journey at the onsite Jimbaran Bay Cooking Academy, take a curative journey at The Healing Village Spa or soak up the chilled-chic vibe – and Southeast Asia’s best cocktails – from a poolside beachfront daybed at Sundara.\n“Tropicsurf’s unique coaching methodology and approach to luxury surfing holidays is the perfect match for what our guests look for when traveling to Bali,” says Uday Rao, General Manager of Four Seasons Jimbaran Bay. “Whether beginner or experienced surfers, they can maximise their time in the water and still enjoy plenty of time with their family or spouse, immersing themselves in everything that Bali has to offer; from the art and spirituality, to the wellbeing rituals, recreational activities and world-class dining.”\nSource:-Four Seasons\nRelated Posts 40% reduction in room rates in Grand Hyatt Taipei in July and August Express your love this Valentine’s Day at Calabash Cove Resort & Spa Melia Hotels International becomes a partner of the World Community Grid, initiative sponsored by IBM Jumeirah Creekside Hotel raises the bar on sustainability standards Hyatt Place Columbia/Downtown/The Vista Celebrates Opening", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T10:52:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
