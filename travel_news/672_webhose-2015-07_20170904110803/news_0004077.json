Because while you may often see complimentary items such as tissues, coffee sachets and basic toiletries in your room, there could be more on offer that you don’t realise.\nSometimes, all you have to do is ask and you may end up being surprised at the items hotels will bring you — either as a free gift or to borrow at no expense. They’re actually pretty stocked up.\nHere are 7 things you may receive:\n1. Phone chargers and adaptors\nIt’s one of the most common thing people forget to bring — and often leave behind on their travels. So if you find yourself without, ask. Many hotels will have no problem lending you one.\n2. Extra toiletries, or other things you won’t find in your room\nAt some Hyatt hotels you can score an impressive list of free things such as mouthwash, slippers, hairspray, nail polish remover wipes, a lint roller and razor. They will also let you borrow a bunch of things at no expense including a curling iron and humidifier.\nAnd sometimes, regular products don’t cut it, especially for guests with allergies or sensitive skin, so some hotels keep special skincare products from a range of brands.\n3. Electronics\nThis can a be rarer get, but the Eventi hotel in New York is leading the way by offering free rentals of a range of gadgets from laptops to wireless speakers, Kindles or even a GoPro.\nAll sorts of gadgets are on offer from the Eventi Hotel in NYC.

Comfier pillows\nHotels are noticing how important sleep quality is for guests, and lately more are offering “pillow menus” with a wide variety of options, including the Shangri La and Holiday Inn. If in doubt about whether you have extra pillow options, just ask the front desk.\nPillow menu at the Holiday Inn. Picture: Thomas Angermann/Flickr Source: Flickr\n5. Bicycles\nSome hotels will even loan you a bike, such as The Jane in New York City’s West Village.\n6. Photocopy machines\nThere are hotels such as the Quality Hotel Regent Rochhampton , Queensland, that will let you use their copy machines for free.\n7. Excercise equipment\nSome Hyatt hotels will loan out Yoga mats or weights.\nSo ultimately just ask, you never know!\nFree yoga mats are provided at the Nolitan Hotel in NYC.
