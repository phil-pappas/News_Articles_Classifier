Ancient Roman aristocrats bathed in these hot springs, and today a few people continue the tradition of cooking in them, bringing eggs and potatoes along on day trips to simmer in the salt water. The water in Ischia’s springs, at about 180 degrees Fahrenheit, and beaches where the sand underground is as hot as 350 degrees, are relics of the island’s volcanic history, which it shares with the nearby Amalfi coast and the whole region. Mount Vesuvius is only about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) away, across the Gulf of Naples. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Both the hot springs and the beaches here have been used as heat sources for cooking for centuries, when fresh water and cooking fuel were scarce and expensive. At a few places, like Ristorante Emanuela, they still are. “Only a few people know about cooking al fumarole any more,” said Sergio Iacono (a distant cousin of Ivo), who is the restaurant’s head chef now that his mother, Emanuela, has retired. The restaurant, accessible only by foot and golf cart, is perched on Maronti beach. The sand underfoot is warm, just as the sand on other beaches is warm after a day in the sun. But dig your toes down a few inches, and instead of cooler, the sand underneath grows hotter and then unbearable. When Filippo, Sergio’s brother (who serves the restaurant as both lifeguard and sand maestro), uses a hoe to dig through the top gray-brown layer, smoke and steam rise from the black sand underneath. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story In the restaurant kitchen, Sergio has already wrapped the ingredients tight in layers of plastic, foil and cloth to keep sand out and aromas in. (It’s not unlike cooking sous vide, or in a dough-sealed tagine, or in the earth ovens used for the Hawaiian kalua or New England clambake.) Each packet includes chicken, tomatoes, onions, potatoes (to absorb the plentiful juices), white wine and herbs — familiar ones like rosemary and basil, or local favorites like borage, piperna and wild garlic. Filippo slings the rope-tied parcels over his shoulder, lowers them into the pit, covers them with ample hot sand, and twists the ropes around the hoe to mark the spot. About an hour later — after antipasti of local artichokes, anchovies, melon and mozzarella rolled with prosciutto and arugula; after a taste of friarielli, a small sweet cousin of broccoli rabe, steamed in vinegar and then drowned in olive oil; a pasta course of thick spaghetti with tomato sauce; and yet another pasta course, of paccheri (wide tubes) with mussels and shreds of pecorino — Filippo heads back out to the now-dark beach and drags the parcels to the surface. As each is hurriedly unwrapped, an herbal, wine-scented blast of pure chicken aroma rises into the air, to the fascination of local children, cats and dogs drawn by the spectacle and the smell. A more everyday version of this dish — which can also be oven-baked in an earthenware pot — is made with rabbit. Rabbits long ran wild over the island, and they are still raised by some farmers in underground tunnels carved out of the soft rock. Although Ischia hasn’t had a major eruption since 1302, the island’s landscape was determined by volcanic activity. Tuff, the soft rock formed by cooled lava and ash, made ideal caves for aging wine. The island’s high forests, thrust up by eruptions, provided shade for wild mushrooms, nuts and roaming pigs. The soil on the green hills is rich enough in ash to support substantial agriculture. Farmers grew grapes, herbs, beans, squashes, cactus fruit and a tear-shaped tomato called piennolo. Ischia’s nickname, “l’isola verde,” refers to both its fertile hills and the characteristic green shade of its tuff.

Wine has been made here since the eighth century B.C., when Greek colonists chose Ischia as their far western outpost in the Mediterranean, and brought their system of terracing, training and pruning grapevines. (Later, Ischia was held by Roman, Ostrogoth, Sicilian, Angevin, barbarian, Bourbon and other powers.) The island’s famous soft white wine, Biancolella, has the minerality and savor that comes from volcanic soil and sea-salt air. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T21:29:52.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
