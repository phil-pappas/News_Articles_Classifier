But there are a number of new destinations and cruising trends coming through as Kiwis look to cruise further afield. \n\"River cruises through Europe and expedition cruises through the Galapagos Islands and Alaska are a lot more in demand than ever before. Destinations such as the Caribbean and the Baltic are also increasing in popularity,\" he says. \nMore and more Kiwis are also opting to cruise around New Zealand with CLIA figures showing sailings in local waters accounted for a significant 53 per cent of all cruise holidays. \nBodger says cruises are gaining popularity across all age groups. Ad Feedback \n\"Expedition cruises in particular are increasingly appealing to the adventure seeker, both young and old. Island hopping cruises through the Pacific are popular with families, particularly those who can see the benefit of having onboard entertainment and a buffet for the kids!\" \nTo find out more about booking the cruise of your dreams, visit www.cruiseabout.co.nz . - Sponsored content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T07:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T15:34:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
