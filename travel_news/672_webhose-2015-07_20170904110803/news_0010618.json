The Belgrade Summer Festival ( belef.rs ) runs until 25 July with classical music, jazz, pop and theatre. Before the free Belgrade Beer Fest ( belgradebeerfest.com ) kicks off in Usce park (1) on 19 August, there's an offshoot from tomorrow until 12 August in Ada Ciganlija with free nightly gigs. It all builds to a climax with the Belgrade Boat Carnival on 29 August, which will see hundreds of boats pile into the river Sava in a riotous parade.\nTouch down \nBelgrade's airport is 18km west of the city and is served by Air Serbia (020 3769 5856; airserbia.com ) from Heathrow and Wizz Air (0911 752 2257; wizzair.com ) from Luton.\nTwo buses go to the centre: A1 to Slavija Square (2) for 300 dinars (£1.80) and Line 72 to Zeleni Venac (3) near the train station (4) for 150 dinars (90p). Both take 30 to 40 minutes and run two to three times an hour. Taxis cost 1,800 dinars (£11) and are booked from the kiosk in the baggage hall.\nGet your bearings \nBelgrade spreads around the confluence of the Danube and Sava rivers, with Stari Grad (old town) on the east side. Looming over both rivers is Kalemegdan Park – home to Belgrade Fortress (5) – the city's historic and green heart. Wide boulevards and squares lead off Kalemegdan, including the busy pedestrianised zone at Knez Mihailova. Overlapping Stari Grad is the affluent district of Dorcol and the cobbled bohemian quarter of Skadarlija.\nAcross the Sava are the communist-era tower blocks of Novi Beograd, which are broken up by large parks including Usce (1). Follow the Danube and you end up in distinctly Hungarian-looking Zemun.\nThe biggest sights are within walking distance, but it's easy to use the trams and buses ( gsp.co.rs ).

Turn right and you're in Trg Republike (12), Republic Square, with more cafés and the towering equestrian statue of Prince Mihailo.\nCarry straight on towards Kalemegdan and lose yourself in the sprawling park (5) with its gardens, monuments, fortifications, restaurants, museums, churches and zoo. The southern tip of the park leads to cobbled Kosancicev Venac, one of Belgrade's oldest streets. Turn right and go down the steps at Velike Stepenice to the Sava. On your right, you'll see Beton Hala, a long waterfront collection of restaurants and clubs.\nLunch on the run \nTake in the views from the riverside terrace at sleek new Savanova (13) at Savsko Setaliste in Savamala (00 381 63 333181) . The Italian-tinged menu has grilled squid in spicy sauce for 860 dinars (£5).\nWindow shopping \nIf you want a change from the high-street chains in Knez Mihailova, head to nearby Kralja Petra street to Koncept 45 (14) at No 45 (00 381 11 262 3332; koncept45.rs ). It's a fun mix of clothing, accessories, gadgets and jewellery.

Choose the artistically rustic interior or the classy garden for Eastern-influenced dishes including blackened chicken \"Lebanese style\" with tabbouleh, hummus and pomegranate (830 dinars/£4.95).\n\nFlower power: the bohemian Skadarlija neighbourhood (Adam Batterbee) Day two \nSunday morning: go to church \nThe enormous Byzantine dome of Sveti Sava temple (22) at Krusedolska is a Belgrade landmarks and, one of these days, the largest Orthodox church in the Balkans might even be finished.

Afterwards you can check out the cutting-edge fashions and furniture.\nA walk in the park \nAda Ciganlija (24) (00 381 11 7857 220; adaciganlija.rs ), is land-locked Serbia's sole Blue Flag beach and turns into a giant playground when temperatures rise. Lined with 7km of pebbly beaches and dozens of cafés, this quasi-island in the Sava has a cooling interior of forests, an adventure park and even a snowboard simulator. Watersports include kayaking, pedalos and an obstacle course.\nTake a ride \nThe wide bike paths along the Sava and Danube are a joy to explore, as are the routes covering Ada Ciganlija.

The story of the visionary Serbian engineer is told through entertaining hourly tours (twice daily in English) and models of his main inventions.\nIcing on the cake \nBelgrade's reputation as a nightlife magnet is boosted by the several hundred floating bars, restaurants and nightclubs lining the Danube and Sava rivers. Known as splavovi, they come in all shapes and sizes – some intimate, others mammoth nightclubs that pound all night.
