The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority said 3.5 million people visited in June representing a 2.4 percent increase compared to a year ago. The agency says 90.4 percent of Vegas rooms were rented in the month. The number of hotel rooms has dropped by nearly 200 to 149,071 with the closure of the Riviera casino-hotel and the re-opening of rooms and the renovated Linq hotel-casino. Rates and revenue earned per room dropped during the month. Convention attendance was down 16.6 percent in June but up 1.7 percent since January.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T23:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T04:08:54.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
