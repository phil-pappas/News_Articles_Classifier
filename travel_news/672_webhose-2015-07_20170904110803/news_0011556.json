The new services will offer passengers more choice and flexibility, as well as facilitate trade, investment, and tourism ties between these two countries.” \n\nThe Deputy Head of Mission at the South African Embassy in Ethiopia, Fefe Dwabayo, said the new service from Addis Ababa to Cape Town would play a crucial role in expanding tourism and investment activities in two fast-growing countries. \n\n“We see it as a precursor of further economic growth and co-operation between the two sisterly countries, which will surely have spillover effects to the continent in general,” she added. \n\nThe Ambassador of Botswana to Ethiopia, Mmamosadinyana Molefe, said the new flight to Gaborone will create more opportunities for the growth of Botswana’s tourism sector. \n\n“Ethiopian Airlines is doing a great job of connecting Africa. This is in line with the African Union (AU) spirit of continental integration and we see this launch as further means of opening up linkages with the rest of the continent,” Molefe added. \n\n\nEthiopian is currently serving more than almost 90 international destinations across five continents with more than 200 daily flights. The national flag carrier’s fleet includes ultra-modern and environmentally friendly aircraft such as the Boeing 787, Boeing 777-300ER, Boeing 777-200LR, Boeing 777-200LR Freighter and the Bombardier Q-400 with double cabin. \nIn 2014, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) ranked Ethiopian as the largest airline in Africa in revenue and profit. In its operation over seven decades, Ethiopian has been a leader, providing the first jet service in the continent in 1962.
