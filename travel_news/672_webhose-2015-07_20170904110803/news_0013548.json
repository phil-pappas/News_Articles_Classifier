Monica Grady, Professor of Planetary and Space Sciences at the Open University, said the one billion euros spent on the Rosetta project had not only created jobs in science and technology, but enthused people around the world. As part of the mission the Philae probe became the first-ever spacecraft to land on a comet, in November last year. Professor Grady was famously captured on TV celebrating euphorically and hugging those around her when news broke that Philae had landed on comet 67P. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs on Sunday, Professor Grady says: “So many people have been following the Rosetta mission and Philae and they’ve been inspired to find out more [including] children who are going to go on to become scientists in the future.” Freddie Flintoff: Why I put my drinking days behind me Theresa May on Tory leadership, clothes and her Desert Island Discs Speaking on the long running programme she urges teachers to do more to encourage children – in particular girls - to pursue science, saying: “I think part of the problem is perception. In the National Curriculum school students are expected to do some science, but it’s not promoted in the way it should be.” She adds: “I can’t stress enough the importance of school teachers and the influence they have.” Professor Grady, who chose Simon and Garfunkel’s Bridge Over Troubled Water and Ultravox’s Vienna among her desert island discs, speaks about her Catholic faith, saying she finds it perfectly compatible with her scientific world view. She also says she anticipates mankind will discover other life forms as a result of space missions such as Rosetta. “In some places it’s more likely than others that life could get going. I don’t think we’ll ever find extra-terrestrial intelligence, but life? I think there’s a really good chance of finding some type of simple life form,” she says. * Professor Monica Grady is on BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs on Sunday at 11.15am. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T07:02:53.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
