Cast your memory back to Patricia Arquette’s head-turning acceptance speech at this year’s Academy Awards , and you might recall the wild cheers from the audience, and Meryl Streep ’s standing ovation in affirmation of Arquette’s call for equality in Hollywood. The Boyhood actress’s powerful message provoked a global discussion about women in Hollywood, but the question remains – what now? Meryl Streep and Jennifer Lopez applaud Patricia Arquette's game-changing speech. It seems Arquette’s call to arms was heeded by her contemporaries, as Meryl Streep has backed her convictions with cash. Streep has funded a groundbreaking new initiative for female screenwriters over the age of 40 which aims to remedy the absence of female voices in narrative film. A change of direction The screenplay development program, entitled The Writers Lab , will be run by New York Women in Film and Television and IRIS, a collective of women filmmakers, in a move to boost opportunities for women screenwriters. The eight winning scribes selected for the initiative will be brought together with established mentors from the film industry, including the likes of Boyhood producer Caroline Kaplan, writer-director of Beyond the Lights Gina Prince-Bythewood, and Legally Blonde writer Kirsten Smith. This comes following a report that women accounted for just 11 per cent of writers working on the top 250 films of 2014, and that 79 per cent of these films had no female writers at all. Meryl Streep has a long track record as a proponent of gender equality in the film industry, and will grace our screens later this year as feminist foot soldier Emmeline Pankhurst in Suffragette, written by Abi Morgan, documenting the struggle for women’s voting rights in Britain. Suffragette, written by Abi Morgan and starring Meryl Streep, Carey Mulligan and Helena Bonham Carter, is released on October 30 2015 Kate Kinninmont MBE Kate Kinninmont, CEO of Women in Film and TV , NYWIFT’s UK sister chapter, has praised Streep’s decisive move in support of the women off-screen who remain under-represented in the industry. “We at Women in Film and Television don't believe in whinging. Rather, we celebrate successful women and take positive action to help equip women for their careers,” she says. “So, we’re delighted that Meryl Streep has come up with this terrific initiative for women screenwriters over 40.” “Ageism and sexism remain endemic in the media. More women than men enter the television industry and the women are, on average, better qualified than the men. Yet by the age of 35 half of those women have disappeared: they simply leave the industry altogether. No wonder, perhaps that 94 per cent of all UK television drama is directed by men. And older women – whether they are actresses or presenters – are still in a tiny minority on our screens.” A report published by the BFI showed that 84 per cent of all UK independent films released between 2010 and 2012 were written by men. However, the findings also showed that British female screenwriters have made a breakthrough in recent years, with figures showing a higher female representation of 37 per cent in the top UK independent films between 2010 and 2012. This suggests that female screenwriters, whilst still under-represented, were behind some of the most successful films in box office terms.

Olivia, 54, is an established screenwriter whose credits include Girl with a Pearl Earring and Wuthering Heights. She says: “When making a film, producers and funders will look for a mid-career writer who is a safe bet with a successful track record of screenwriting. Unfortunately, the figures show that there are fewer female screenwriters, so that in itself makes women screenwriters look risky.” Scarlett Johansson as Griet in Girl with a Pearl Earring, 2003 (Jaap Buitendijk) “In general, the figures are not getting better and the number of female screenwriters is not increasing. But the important question is – what is the effect of that? And, why does it matter? I think what it boils down to is that when we’re not representing women’s voices, we’re not going to see the stories of women.” • Olivia Hetreed: 'Age is an advantage for screenwriters' “There needs to be a more comprehensive rethinking by all institutions in order to change the habit of making the same decisions. In terms of age, it’s generally considered that age is a benefit to writing; you have more life experience, more empathy, more subject matter. Number of major female film directors has fallen over 17 years Women in film: no improvement since the 1950s Patricia Arquette Oscars speech confronted an ugly Hollywood truth Ming Ho Ming Ho is a TV scriptwriter, and has written for the likes of EastEnders, Casualty and Heartbeat. Ming says: “I really feel something like Meryl Streep's scheme would be a huge asset to UK screenwriting, in order to develop the voices of mature writers who have life experience to share and whose talent is otherwise going to waste.” Now in her 40s, Ming is re-launching her career after an unintended 10-year hiatus to look after her mum who suffers from dementia . “This caregiving responsibility has had a huge impact on my career and effectively wiped 10 years from it at what should have been my most productive and lucrative time,” she says. “This is something I believe affects a huge number of women in competitive professions and is a major reason for the imbalance in male/female screenwriting ratios at the upper end of the business.” • Ming Ho: 'People assume you're past it at 50' What do you think? Olivia’s tips for screenwriters: Find comfort in numbers – find other writers to work with so you’re not alone on a project. Think carefully about the type of film you want to write, and the kind of people who would want to make it. Screenwriting requires hard graft. So, just get on and do it. The Writers' Guild is a fantastic resource for writers, offering support. Ming’s tips for screenwriters: Be selfish. In freelance professions there are no management structures to protect you; and with no office hours, it’s all too easy for your time to be eroded by other people’s needs - don’t be afraid to put yourself first. Experience doesn’t necessarily count, you can’t rely on track record; it’s all about visibility and confidence. If you have become invisible through a career break, you need a hook – a prize, a scheme, a mentorship - to attract new attention.
