Local business leaders and airport officials understand the pain but also realize the economics behind adding any new service to Louisville International Airport. Tuesday morning's What's Brewing? event hosted by Louisville Business First at the Kentucky International Convention Center, addressed the challenges for improving air service in Louisville. Related Content See All Homes of the Day The event was a panel discussion with Jim Welch , vice chairman of Louisville-based Brown-Forman Corp. (NYSE:BFB) and chairman of the Louisville Regional Airport Authority board of directors; Jonathan Blue , chairman and managing director of Blue Equity LLC; and Skip Miller , executive director of the Louisville Regional Airport Authority. Today, four companies — American Airlines Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines Inc. (NYSE: DAL), United Airlines Inc. (NYSE: UAL) and Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV) -— control about 85 percent of the airlines seats in the market, and they have started to use larger jets and fewer flights, Miller said. Because of that, Welch said, airports must show they can fill about 80 percent of seats on flights on a regular basis to add a flight. Beyond that, there is the economics of the situation. Miller said airlines want to see $20 million to $30 million worth of revenue for any flight service it adds to an airport, and it is up to the airport to prove to the airline that those figures can be attained. An interesting fact: Miller said airlines typically break even on their actual airline services and make their profits through the fees they charge passengers, such as those fees for changing a flight or checking a bag. To help find ways to supplement air service locally, Greater Louisville Inc., the metro chamber of commerce, has formed a task force known as the Regional Air Coalition , composed primarily of business leaders to study the data surrounding flights at the airport and find ways to make improvements. The coalition is in its early stages, but ideas it already has explored include the recruitment of luxury charter services and a partnership with United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE:UPS) that could create commercial flights on UPS cargo jets. Welch said the coalition also plans to work with industry consultants on \"inducing\" demand for nonstop flights to cities such as Boston and Los Angeles. I'll have more of the panelists' insights on this topic in the July 17 weekly edition of Louisville Business First. \nWant Louisville Travel news in your inbox?
