The 140 room Cambria property will be located at the intersection of International Dr. and Central Florida Parkway and is expected to open in 2017. This world class location is within walking distance from three SeaWorld parks, and will provide close proximity to all the Orlando area parks and leisure attractions. The hotel will also be one mile from the Orange County Convention Center. \n\"We continue to experience strong momentum in bringing the Cambria hotels & suites experience to new business and leisure travelers, and we're excited to announce our new hotel in Orlando,\" said Michael Murphy, senior vice president, Upscale Brands, Choice Hotels International. \"This is another tremendous step forward for the Cambria brand – to be able to bring the fresh, upscale and affordable hotel offerings of Cambria to the heart of Orlando, one of the largest leisure travel areas in the United States and a thriving business community.\" \n\"We are thrilled about our affiliation with Choice Hotels' Cambria brand,\" said Matt Gillio \"I have been conducting business in Central Florida for twenty five years, and I believe the Cambria hotel & suites International Drive property will be a great addition to this market, in a location that attracts so many leisure and business travelers. We are very grateful to Orange County for all their assistance to bring this exciting development to a reality.\" The Greater Orlando area has become a world renowned destination because it offers something for everyone including: three Sea World Parks, Orlando Convention Center, Disney and Universal Studios plus world famous shopping and dining. Beyond the obvious attractions for leisure travelers, Orlando is a popular choice for corporations, who see the eclectic city as a perfect meeting or conference destination to drive high attendance and satisfaction scores. \nDesigned as a business travel and leisure brand, all Cambria hotels are new-construction and feature a larger lobby to give guests a more social atmosphere; oversized rooms that are larger than standard hotel rooms and include ample living, working and sleeping spaces; and the latest technology that allows guests to stay connected while they travel. \nLike all Cambria hotels & suites, the International Drive Orlando property will feature other fine amenities such as a contemporary bistro, Social Circle™, serving a menu of local specialties created by Chef Michael DeMaria; liquor, wine, beer and freshly prepared grab-and-go gourmet salads and sandwiches; and a barista bar. This property will also boast over 2,000 square feet of meeting and reception space for events, complimented by onsite catering and excellent service.
