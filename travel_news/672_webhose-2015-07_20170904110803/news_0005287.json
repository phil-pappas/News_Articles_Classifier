Reach Agreement with a Group of... -- LAS VEGAS, July 20, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Caesars Entertainment, Caesars Entertainment Operating Co. Reach Agreement with a Group of Second Lien Noteholders on Debt Restructuring 21:02 ET from Caesars Entertainment Corporation LAS VEGAS , July 20, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Caesars Entertainment Corporation (NASDAQ: CZR) (\"Caesars Entertainment\") and Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, Inc. (\"CEOC\") have entered into a restructuring agreement with holders of a significant amount of CEOC's second-lien notes. This agreement provides for a substantial improvement in recoveries for second lien noteholders and adds to the group of creditors supporting CEOC's restructuring plan. The agreement will go effective when holders owning greater than 50% of second lien debt sign the agreement. With the public announcement of the terms of this enhanced restructuring agreement, Caesars Entertainment and CEOC will seek to gain further support. Pursuant to the agreement, second lien noteholders who sign the agreement by the date holders owning greater than 50% of second lien debt sign the agreement, (or 10 days after such date if occurring before August 19, 2015 ), shall receive a forbearance fee. Holders eligible to receive the fee will receive their pro rata share of at least $200 million in convertible notes to be issued by Caesars Entertainment in consideration for forbearing in respect to certain alleged defaults. These holders also have the potential to receive an additional $200 million of convertible notes either directly or through an enhanced class recovery as outlined more fully below. In addition, Caesars Entertainment and CEOC have agreed to several improvements from the Restructuring Support Agreement announced on January 14, 2015 , as follows: Caesars Entertainment will contribute an additional $200 million of Caesars Entertainment convertible notes to the class of second lien noteholders if the class votes in favor of CEOC's plan of reorganization. If the class does not vote in favor, the additional notes shall be distributed to second lien noteholders who have signed the agreement as an additional fee; Caesars Entertainment will contribute approximately 5% common equity stake in PropCo (or cash) to the class of second lien noteholders; Caesars Entertainment will contribute an additional approximately 5% common equity stake in PropCo (or cash) to the class of second lien noteholders if the class of second lien noteholders votes in favor of CEOC's plan of reorganization. If the class does not vote in favor, the additional equity (or cash) shall be distributed to second lien noteholders who have signed the agreement as an additional fee; Under certain conditions, second lien noteholders will have the opportunity to purchase, at plan value, a minimum of 2.5% of the PropCo Common Stock to be issued to first lien noteholders and a maximum of 100% of such stock; Caesars Entertainment has agreed to grant PropCo a call right to purchase the real estate associated with Harrah's New Orleans , consistent with the previously granted call right granted for the real estate underlying Harrah's Atlantic City and Harrah's Laughlin . Consistent with the Restructuring Support and Forbearance Agreement dated January 14, 2015 and supported by more than 80% of first-lien noteholders, CEOC voluntarily commenced a Chapter 11 reorganization on January 15, 2015 . The restructuring plan contemplates that CEOC will convert its corporate structure by separating virtually all of its US-based gaming operating assets and real property assets into two companies, including an operating entity (\"OpCo\") and a newly formed, publicly traded real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") that will directly or indirectly own a newly formed property company (\"PropCo\"). The proposed transactions would reduce CEOC's debt by approximately $10 billion, providing for the exchange of approximately $18.4 billion of outstanding debt for $8.6 billion of new debt. Annual interest expense would be reduced by approximately 75%, from approximately $1.7 billion to approximately $450 million. PropCo would lease its real property assets to OpCo in exchange for annual lease payments of $635 million, subject to certain adjustments, with the lease payments guaranteed by Caesars Entertainment. Except as detailed above or in the Form-8K filed with the SEC today, today's agreement with the group of second-lien noteholders is consistent with the January 14, 2015 RSA. The restructuring plan is subject to approval by the bankruptcy court and the receipt of required gaming regulatory approvals. Caesars Entertainment and CEOC are continuing to work to obtain additional support from other CEOC creditors. About Caesars Entertainment Operating Company Inc.
