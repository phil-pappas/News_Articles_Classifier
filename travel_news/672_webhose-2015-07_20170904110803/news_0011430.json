After all, the last time we took a family holiday, in 1981, it was such a disaster that it directly led to our divorce. Could we make a joint holiday work 33 years later? And would we be able to cope with five boisterous grandchildren, three boys and two girls, aged from 14 down to nine? Isle of Eigg (Photo Library) The grandchildren, naturally enough, were excited at the prospect especially as the chosen island, Eigg , is particularly hard to get to. We would have to take overnight sleepers, race to a waiting taxi, then drive like crazy to Mallaig, where with any luck we would catch the 11 am ferry that would deposit us on Eigg. At some stage, our son Will and his wife NJ said they would like to come. That would make four adults to five children, a much more symmetrical arrangement. NJ offered to organise the catering, another plus. • 12 extraordinary Scotland landscapes On the appointed day, we met at Euston Station. The kids said they had been looking forward to it for ages, but gave us curious looks when we mentioned the word \"adventure\". Arthur, the eldest, had brought a poker set and naturally, they all had their iPads and phones. \"Yes,\" we told them, \"you will have to do that very strange thing for kids today, which is to go outdoors . You will also have to climb a mountain.\" They stared at us as if we were joking. Steam engine pulls a passenger train to Fort William from Mallaig (Alamy) As it happened, we had an adventure before we even arrived. On the way to Fort William, where we were to pick up the taxi, a man threw himself under the train , killing himself in the process. He was the ex-boyfriend of the female train driver, and his fatal action meant that the train stopped for an hour in the middle of nowhere. By the time we got into the taxi, it was obvious that there was no way we would be able to catch the ferry. NJ pleaded with the ferry company to wait but they refused. The taxi driver said we might be able to charter a boat, and then a miracle happened. NJ got onto Scotrail , told them the story, and astonishingly they not only arranged a special charter for us, but also paid for it and reimbursed us for the missed ferry. There is a God, we told ourselves. Otherwise we would have had to stay overnight in Mallaig , sleeping on the beach as there was no room in any of the inns. The boat journey took 45 minutes and by now the kids were crazt with excitement, especially as on the way we saw dolphins and whales. We were met the other end by Stuart, owner of Glebe Barn , the self-catering hostel where we were to stay. Our provisions, pre-ordered by NJ, were in the trailer and I was glad to see a dozen bottles of wine were on board as well. The picturesque Island of Eigg (Alamy) Arthur, true to his nature, had researched every detail about Eigg on his phone, and regaled us about it on the way to the hostel. The island has an interesting history. A few years ago the islanders clubbed together to buy it back from its previous owner, Keith Schellenberg , so now there is home rule for Eigg, and a thriving tourist industry. • Who are the happiest people in Europe? Although tiny, only three miles by five, it is no longer primitive. There is one shop, one pub and a tiny school, a retreat centre, and many shepherds’ cottages, known as bothies, now tarted up for the tourists. There is a windfarm and most of the houses have solar panels. The island makes its own electricity – more than it needs. And, thankfully, there is wifi. I don’t think the children would have come otherwise. We arrived at Glebe Barn, a large nineteenth-century house that has been adapted for large groups. It is plain, functional and youth hostelly, with a huge industrial kitchen and single beds in all the rooms. The three boys chose one room, the two girls another and the adults, the ones left over. Then, exhausted, we got down to the serious business of drinking wine and cooking the supper. • Drinking wine every night hasn't done me any harm Arthur got his poker set out, the girls changed into pyjamas, plaited their long hair and embarked on a jigsaw. We had baked potatoes, baked beans, cheese and fruit for supper and went to bed at 9.30. So, first day over. The kids were not up until 10.45 next morning and they all had a shower, making puddles everywhere, in defiance of the written instructions not to. Over a sandwich lunch the kids talked earnestly about religion, with 13-year old Otto proclaiming himself a ‘strong atheist’. Nine year old Henry opined that religion was a ‘Pandora’s Box.’ Nev and I had the same thought; they are not little children any more, but mini-adults – in some ways at least. Liz and her ex-husbnad Neville (Liz Hodgkinson) After lunch, the others went for a walk while Nev and I stayed in to catch up on reading. It started to rain, then pour, and then there was another drama. Two soaking wet Germans knocked at the door. They had been camping and their tent was sodden. They had heard that this was a hostel, but we had taken it over completely for the week. Nev let them in. They took off all their clothes, put them in the tumble drier and, wrapped in towels, warmed themselves by the wood-burning stove. We gave them a cup of tea and some biscuits. They were so grateful. Then NJ, Will and the kids came in, also soaking wet. They changed into pyjamas and also sat round the wood-burning stove. The living room was toasty warm but the rest of the house was freezing, even in August. Glamping , it ain’t. In the evening, Arthur got the poker game out again and Nev joined in. In his youth he had been a poker fanatic and gave no quarter. The old stag, the middle aged stag (Will) and the young stags battled it out. Otto announced that he wanted to go to the Brit School , a specialist performing and visual arts school for talented kids. Arthur said he wanted to go to Oxford. • Britain's quirkiest B&Bs The girls and Henry have no such ambitions yet. Next day dawned bright and clear but could we get the kids up? The boys were very unruly together, fighting and arguing all the time. When I told them to quieten down Henry said, \"We’re only children.\" But Nev and I are bonding with them and getting to know them, for the first time, really. We have never before spent more than a few hours together. On the top of the Sgurr. From left: Deillah, Arthur, Will, NJ, Pearl, Liz (Liz Hodgkinson) The highlight of the holiday was supposed to be a climb up the Sgurr , the strange-shaped mountain that dominates Eigg. It looked daunting from the ground and I kept getting stuck in mud, my inadequate trainers squelching. I also fell into bogs. \"I’m too old for this lark,\" I wailed as the kids bounded along. But I made the top to mighty (and patronising) cheers. Then there was the long climb back but the kids never complained once. Back home, the boys got straight into playing Monopoly and the girls decided to make a lemon drizzle cake. Budding Mary Berrys . One thing I didn’t like is that they stayed in their pyjamas until ordered fiercely to get dressed. \"In our day,\" I told them, \"you were only allowed to come downstairs in pyjamas if you were ill.\" They were also rarely in bed before midnight. So the days passed with long walks, earnest discussions on religion and politics over dinner, Monopoly and poker and lots and lots of wine in the evenings. And very few arguments. Maybe we were just too tired to argue. Going to Eigg together was a risky experiment but it turned out a success. The kids relaxed with us and we are no longer strangers to them. We shan’t be doing it again, though. Note: Otto realised his dream and he got into the Brit School to study visual art.
