Here are three. \nSpain is a popular summer holiday destination for visitors from the world over, and for good reason. The beaches are pristine, the weather is wonderful, and the locals are friendly. What’s more, the prices of most things in Spain are more reasonable than many of its neighbours, allowing you to stretch your budget while enjoying every moment of your stay. Apart from its fabulous fiestas, of course, the next best thing about Spain is its length of breath-taking coastline. Here are three top coastal destinations in Spain. \nAsturias \nThe word ‘exquisite’ does not fully do justice to the cliff-edged, emerald green coastline of Asturias, and you really have to see it for yourself. Friendly beach villages and locals offering the country’s famous hospitality, exciting surfing opportunities, and remote, romantic coves make up this wonderful region. What’s more, it’s not a one-trick pony and you can go beyond the beaches to explore the nearby hills and mountain trails for something a little different. If you’re energetic and adventurous you can embark on an exploration of the coast of Asturias; it can include picturesque walks along mountain trails, and a British-run, century-old farmhouse near Arriondas, called Posada del Valle, in which to get your fill of scrumptious home-cooked food. \nCosta Brava’s Tamariu \nCosta Brava’s Tamariu coastline is the perfect destination for those who love romance and a true sense of privacy. The skyline is unspoiled by modern high-rise buildings and you'll get a distinct feeling of going back in time, as most of the villages have retained their traditional character. With its golden sands and boasting some of the clearest waters in the region, this stretch of coastline (which is easily accessible via an hour’s drive north of Barcelona) is a haven for those who pine for an escape. Tamariu’s horseshoe bay is also a must visit, if only to sample the delicacies of any of its restaurants. \nCantabria’s West Coast \nThe pristine beaches in Western Cantabria are simply stunning. Picturesque fishing towns and farmsteads that are hundreds of years old populate this 50-kilometre stretch of coastline. A large part of the area is actually a protected natural park, which explains the excellent level of conservation and natural beauty of this bountiful coastline. \nHopping from One Beach to the Next \nWhile you may not want to spend time travelling from one coastal destination to the next, it is wonderful to be able to get a different ‘feel’ of the country’s coasts. It is easy to do so if you use a good airport shuttle service, which will give you the best option of conserving valuable travel time. A reputable airport shuttle service, whose services you can avail of to get you to your accommodation right from the airport, is one of the most convenient means to get your holiday off to a stress-free start – and continue it that way.
