The campaign will continue throughout the year at the Virginia Beach ( Sept. 5-6 ), Philadelphia ( Oct. 31 ), and Las Vegas ( Nov. 12-15 ) events. Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150715/237134 The \"My Drive Comes From\" campaign will give all Rock 'n' Roll Marathon runners at the four races an opportunity to share unique and personal messages about what inspires them to run. During race registration, runners will be able to share their own \"My Drive Comes From\" motivation at the Travelers footprint at the two-day Health & Fitness Expo. Runners can promote their personal message about why they run by penning their motivation on a customized race poster, which will be photographed along with each runner and can be shared by the runner online. Additionally, runners' photos will be posted on a custom microsite ( www.mydrivecomesfrom.com ), where friends and family can also post unique encouragement messages that will be shared on the actual Rock 'n' Roll Marathon race course via a digital billboard. Runners will also be encouraged to share their photos on social media by using the hashtag #MyDriveComesFrom. \"We are thrilled to have Travelers once again be part of the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon Series with its creative 'My Drive Comes From' campaign,\" said Sean Clottu , Vice President of Partnership Marketing of the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon Series. \"This is a great way to enable runners to share their Rock 'n' Roll experience while also helping a great cause in the Casey Feldman Foundation.\"Committed to raising awareness about the dangers of distracted driving, Travelers will use the campaign as a platform to highlight \"the drive\" of runner Joel Feldman . In 2009, Feldman lost his 21-year-old daughter Casey to a distracted driving accident. The attorney then founded EndDD.org (End Distracted Driving) to raise awareness of the dangers of distracted driving. Travelers will donate $100 to EndDD.org's charitable arm, the Casey Feldman Foundation, for every mile run by Feldman and two other EndDD.org representatives throughout all four races. Travelers' donation has potential to reach more than $15,000 at the end of the campaign. \"We're excited to continue our sponsorship of Rock 'n' Roll Marathons and launch this motivational 'My Drive Comes From' campaign,\" said Jay Gauthier , Chief Marketing Officer, Travelers Personal Insurance. \"By partnering with EndDD.org, we can help draw attention to the risks of distracted driving, which makes this sponsorship much more meaningful.\"\"On behalf of EndDD.org we are excited to partner with Travelers and the 'My Drive Comes From' campaign to help raise awareness to risks associated with distracted driving,\" Feldman said. \"This cause is incredibly important to me, and one that has affected me greatly. It's where my drive comes from and I know this partnership with Travelers will make a difference.\" 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T21:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T22:01:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
