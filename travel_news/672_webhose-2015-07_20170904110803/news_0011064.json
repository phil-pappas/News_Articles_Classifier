The mangrove forest, the only one on the East Coast, is the second largest in India after the Sunderbans, the release said. \nThis circuit will envisage a passenger terminal with jetty, water sports, marine or water park, maritime museum, sea-plane rides, home-stay facility and convention center. \n\"We can have 5-6 passenger terminals with jetty across the state. And, e-rickshaws can be introduced to ferry passengers around the tourism spots,\" the Chief Minister said. \nNoting that most of these projects could be given on PPP basis, he said a cruise ride from Rajahmundry to Papikondalu (a picturesque location comprising hills along Godavari river) could be introduced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T22:30:06.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
