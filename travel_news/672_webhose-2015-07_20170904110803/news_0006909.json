Surrounded by the sea, dotted with fertile farms and home to its famous breed of cattle, islanders are rightfully proud of the abundance of local produce. The inaugural Guernsey International Food Festival is set to celebrate this heritage from September 18- 27, 2015. Two of Guernsey's finest hotels, The Duke of Richmond and Guernsey's only five-star property, The Old Government House Hotel and Spa , will be participating in the festival to showcase the bounty of the island as well as its varied hospitality. The Old Government House Hotel is also home to the 2015 Channel Islands' Chef of the Year winner, Pascal Lemoine. \nCocktail Week will be celebrating the island's thriving cocktail scene and will take place at The Crown Club at the Old Government House Hotel and Spa and The Leopard Bar and Restaurant at The Duke of Richmond, in addition to other venues. Mixologists will be shaking up inspiring concoctions featuring Haut Maison fruit liqueurs from September 11 to 18 before presenting their drinks at the Great Guernsey Mix Off Competition on September 19. Following Cocktail Week, Restaurant Week will run from September 18 to 27 at restaurants across the island, including the restaurants at both The Duke of Richmond and The Old Government House. Chefs will have the opportunity to showcase Guernsey's delicious local produce across a range of specially crafted festival menus and dishes. \nFor the first weekend of the festival, both hotel kitchens will serve up an array of tempting hot dishes at the Big Guernsey Market at Crown Pier, St Peter Port, and visitors can also enjoy a range of demonstrations and tasters at the Live Food Show . The Old Government House will host a special Guernsey Gold Dinner on September 19, featuring a five-course menu created by Pascal using carefully selected produce from local artisans. At The Duke of Richmond on September 22, the innovative Food Lab will randomly pair five of the island's top chefs with five top Guernsey producers and challenge the teams to create an inspiring and creative dish at this exciting one off event. \nGuests looking for a true immersion in the island's festivities can take advantage of The Old Government House Hotel and Spa's \" Guernsey International Food Festival Package ,\" including a two-night stay, cocktails and canap√©s on arrival, a three-course dinner at the Brassiere, a Champagne Afternoon Tea and a 10% discount on treatments at the hotel's luxurious Spa.
