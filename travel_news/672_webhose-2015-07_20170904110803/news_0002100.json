CAG will also be working closely with Xiamen Airlines on exclusive offers and shopping promotions to enhance the retail and dining experience for its passengers at Changi Airport.\nMr Lee Seow Hiang, CAG’s Chief Executive Officer said, “The Chinese market holds enormous potential and in terms of passenger traffic, Xiamen is currently the fourth largest Chinese city for Changi Airport, just behind the key metros of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. CAG values the deep partnership we have established with Xiamen Airlines, who has been a supportive and active partner in joint marketing activities in and outside of China. The signing of this MOU is a strategic step to enhance our connectivity through the establishment of more direct air services to new secondary and third-tier cities in China.”\nOver the past few years, Xiamen Airlines has achieved healthy growth at Changi Airport, registering a compounded annual growth rate of 9% in passenger traffic since 2009. Despite the decline in tourist arrivals from China to Singapore last year, Xiamen Airlines achieved positive growth of 5% in its passenger traffic between Singapore and China. Notably, the airline’s traffic at Changi Airport has achieved a strong growth of 28% for the first five months in 2015 compared to the same period last year.\nXiamen Airlines Chairman & President, Mr Che Shanglun, said, “Southeast Asia, and in particular Singapore, is an important market for Xiamen Airlines. Ever since the first Xiamen-Singapore service was launched in 1986, the airline has continued to develop more services from Singapore to newer destinations in China. We are very happy to further our strategic partnership and look forward to continuing our close collaboration with CAG to provide a convenient and comfortable travel experience for more travellers in the future.”\nAs at 1 July 2015, Xiamen Airlines operates 28 weekly services from Singapore to seven cities in China – Dalian, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, Tianjin, Xiamen, Xi’an and Zhengzhou. Of the above seven points, Xiamen Airlines is the only carrier operating flights to and from Dalian, Fuzhou and Zhengzhou.\nSource:- Changi Airport\nRelated Posts Singapore Changi Airport’s Terminal 4 makes excellent facilities for passengers Changi Airport Operating Indicators for October 2014 BOC Aviation Marks 20th Year With Record Net Profit in 2013 Norwegian announced three long-haul routes to America", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T06:51:20.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
