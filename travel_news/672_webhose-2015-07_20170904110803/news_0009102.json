That time of adversity or intense competition that spurred them on. For Lawrence Clarke it was a stint working at a multinational insurance firm last autumn. It is a fitting place for someone who – Eton-educated and an heir to the Baronetcy of Dunham Lodge – is not the typical 110-metres hurdler. After surprising everyone, himself included, when finishing fourth at the London Olympics Games in 2012, Clarke was forced to endure adversity when numerous hamstring tears followed a broken wrist and the past two seasons drifted by in a fog of missed opportunities. • Zharnel Hughes' incredible athletics journey Confronted with an early end to the 2014 season after yet another hamstring problem put him out of the European Championships final, Clarke, 25, spent his “enforced break” last year working for one of his sponsors, Jardine Lloyd Thompson, in the City of London. “Sitting in an office every day for eight or nine hours was a very different experience to being on the track,” he says. “It gave me a lot of perspective. Talking to people in the office made me realise how much the Olympic Games means to me. Clarke reacts after competing at the British Championships in Birmingham earlier this year “It made me think: ‘When I leave the office at the end of October I am going to hit the track hard and make sure every session is the best it can be.' “It really put an emphasis on the fact that I have this opportunity and I shouldn’t waste it. Having had two years of waste I was determined when I came back to make sure I could do well.” A flurry of headwinds and poor conditions meant that Clarke’s hard work in training was not reflected in competition in the early stages of the current campaign and he was struggling to make the qualifying standard for next month’s World Championships. “It just wasn’t happening,” he admits. • Bolt will once again try to 'save' the 100m at Olympic Stadium That was until he received a little help from a certain former world record holder. “I had a very interesting call from Colin Jackson the Sunday after the trials,” Clarke says. “He had watched my race back, analysed it and decided how I was going to run quicker. “For the first time in my career, he implemented a week’s training programme where he said I should put the hurdles really rather low in training which meant I ended up running much quicker. It was very positive to have that input and it gave me a lot of confidence going into last week.” • Peacock seeks to maintain status as fastest single‑leg amputee sprinter Ever since he put the phone down, the Jackson effect has been on full show. In his first post-Jackson race Clarke ran 13.39sec in Lucerne, Switzerland, to equal the time he achieved in the Olympic final three years ago. “It was a real relief and made me feel I can finally get back to where I was,” he says. Clarke competing in Birmingham With one World Championships qualifying standard to his name, Clarke has run it twice more to triumph in races in Loughborough and Bellinzona, Switzerland, over the past few days to book his place in Beijing. Ever the realist, Clarke is the first to admit that he is still some way off the best sprint hurdlers in the world, describing the three men who have already broken 13 seconds this year as “on another level”. • Felix takes it all in her elegant stride A chance to test himself against some of the world’s best comes on Friday at the Sainsbury’s Anniversary Games, where such is the strength of the field that it is one of only three disciplines with separate heats and a final. Though aware of the task ahead of him, Clarke says that he “couldn’t be in a better place” going into the competition. “When I ran at the Anniversary Games in 2013 I still had a tear in my hamstring so it was a waste of time and I ran 13.88sec which is so poor. It was very disappointing and really quite heartbreaking to go back to a place where the year before I had run a personal best and come fourth in the Olympic Games. • Ennis-Hill optimistic over her biggest challenge yet since childbirth “This time I have run 13.39sec a week out so I know that, if I get into that stadium and have the crowd behind me, with the memories coming back then I can do well. I want to try and erase the story that has come from London 2012 and move on with the future, a bit like the event has.” Courtesy of Jackson and a major insurance firm, Clarke is ready for the next phase. The Sainsbury’s Anniversary Games takes place at the former Olympic Stadium in London on July 24-26.
