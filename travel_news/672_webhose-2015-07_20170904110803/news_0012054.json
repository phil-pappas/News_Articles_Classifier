The Eden Club at Pittormie Castle in St Andrews will shortly embark on a luxurious and sensitive development within the estate to create 10 ultra-high-end residences with four bedrooms each. \nThe move will double the number of fully serviced second-homes on the estate in addition to the 8 stately suites located within the main castle. The investment will be privately funded by the owners following rising demand for memberships from wealthy visitors from around the world. Fiona McIlroy, General Manager of the Eden Club and Pittormie Castle, commented; “Our owners believe that it is the right time to invest in the property as we see opportunities for growth in our international membership club model. “We now have great demand from international members looking to visit Scotland year round, to play golf, hunt or enjoy other pursuits using our iconic castle home as their base. “Unlike other Scottish clubs, The Eden Club is not venue dependent. Members join an international club which gives access to multiple dimensions wherever they reside including a luxurious lifestyle concierge, outstanding events schedule and private residence club.” Pittormie Castle and estate was purchased by in 2005 from the McKinnon family who until recently owned Drambuie. Working with Historic Scotland, The Eden Club carried out a detailed and sensitive renovation to create the most luxurious private embers club at the home of golf. It now hosts over 700 members from 42 different countries. Within the grounds of the estate, members have a choice of dining with restaurants and bars managed by Allan Donald, a Michelin-starred chef. There is also a swimming pool, sauna and gym, tennis courts, plus a raft of other activities. Golf fans can also practice their short game on a new short game centre within the grounds. The castle is particularly popular with the North American market where the residence club model is more established. Over half of the Eden Club members are American based business and leisure travellers, paying tens of thousands of pounds for the privilege of joining. The Eden Club is currently preparing for its own series of events around the Open Golf Championship held in St Andrews in less than two week’s time. The castle will host some of the world’s top players during the competition and is also hosting a gala dinner for golfers and their wives. But the gated estate will be heavily guarded, as the privacy and security of its high profile guests comes as paramount. Work on the expansion commences in November 2015 and is expected to complete in time for the 2017 summer golfing season.
