Ryanair said this would minimise cancellations and disruptions for Europe’s consumers in Spain, Italy, Germany and the UK.\nRyanair chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said: “It's unacceptable that Europe’s consumers repeatedly have their holiday and travel plans disrupted or cancelled by the selfish actions of ATC unions every summer, who use strikes as a first weapon rather than a last resort.”\nA spokesman for the Public and Commercial Services union, which represents other air traffic control workers, told The Guardian : “Instead of trying to restrict the fundamental right to strike, which would level the UK down to some of the most repressive regimes in the world, companies like Ryanair would be better advised to lobby governments and employers to ensure workers get a fair deal to prevent disputes escalating.”\nRyanair will present the petition to the EU Commission once it reaches one million signatures.", "external_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/01/ryanair-calls-ban-strikes-european-air-traffic-controllers", "https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-07-02T17:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T17:34:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
