Heathrow said passenger traffic spiked for travel between London and Mexico (23.6 per cent), China (15.2 per cent) and Turkey (3.4 per cent).\nAt Gatwick, officials said the airport has had 12 months of consecutive growth for long-haul routes, with the biggest increases in passenger traffic involving destinations in the US (20.6 per cent), United Arab Emirates (11.7 per cent) and the Caribbean and Latin America (8.1 per cent).\nBoth airports released duelling statements on why they deserve to take on a new runway.\nHeathrow said passenger traffic spiked for travel between London and Mexico, China and Turkey\nHeathrow CEO John Holland-Kaye said: ‘On the first of July, the Airports Commission ended the debate on where a new runway should be built by unanimously recommending Heathrow’s new expansion plan.\n‘It’s now a binary choice for the British Government. We either expand Heathrow – creating jobs, growth, a rebalanced economy and lucrative export routes – or we do nothing and retreat as a nation.\n‘The answer is obvious, so let’s get on with it.’\nGatwick has dismissed the Airports Commission's report as flawed and unfair as it was based on old figures.\nGatwick CEO Stewart Wingate said: ‘Gatwick remains the best option for expansion as it can cater for all airline types flying to all types of destination – this is clearly illustrated by the growth in the numbers of passengers choosing long haul services at Gatwick.\n‘We will continue to engage actively with government at all levels to show why Gatwick expansion is the only means by which we can sustain the low cost revolution that has driven aviation growth over the last two decades, and the only choice which can actually deliver the aviation capacity that the UK desperately needs.'", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1DizOlx"], "published": "2015-07-16T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T22:26:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
