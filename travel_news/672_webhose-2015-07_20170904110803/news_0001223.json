We arrive there at 2.25pm and leave at 10.45pm. Is there anything we can do to fill in the eight hours?\nDoc: It’s a quick simple train ride into Zurich city from the airport. If you have lots of hand luggage, leave it at the supervised left luggage counter next to the service centre on level one as you exit to the carpark and train station. The trains operate every 10 minutes and the trip into town will only take 11 minutes, giving you plenty of time to look around.\nTo familiarise yourself with the city, hop on a cycle-rickshaw tour. This will be provided by a local who will take you along the lake of Zurich, through the historic centre to the shopping district and finally drop you at the Langstrasse for bars and cafes.\nThese 60 or 90-minute tours operate daily and the 4pm or 6pm departure would suit you. They are for two people and depart from the Hotel Schweizerhof, opposite the train terminal.\nSimilarly there is the ETukTuk tours. They depart from the taxi stand at the train station and again a local will be eager to share their city knowledge with you on a tour through the Old Town and Kreis 5 district. They will stop for photos or purchases and there is a 3.30pm service.\nAfter this, if you would like to revisit an area, it’s easy to jump on the tram that runs around the city centre.\nIf you have time, include a visit to the Swiss National Museum and stop for an aperitif at the Wine Cave, Hotel Hirschen in the Old Town, which dates back to 1340.\n Chiang Mai Highlands.

I have been looking online for local tour companies to look after the golf, transfers and the accommodation part of the trip. There are different tours available but I am wary of parting with cash to companies online. Have you heard of Golfasian Co Ltd. Are they legitimate or can you recommend any Australian companies that do the same?\nDoc: Unfortunately, I have not dealt with or received feedback on this particular company, but they do appear to have all the correct licences and memberships. They also offer phone numbers for contact and payment by Paypal, which is good security. To alleviate any worries you may have about sending money to an international company you are unfamiliar with, let’s have a look at a couple of Australian operators.\nGo Golfing ( gogolfing.net.au ) can tailor a package in Thailand to suit you. They have holidays to various parts of the country with itineraries in place or can organise one specific to your requirements. They also offer a 24-hour help desk, professional advice and can arrange everything from travel insurance to transfers. Another company, Golf Holiday Experiences (golfholiday experiences.com.au), a subsidiary of International Sports Tours, offers this sample itinerary to Chiang Mai. After acclimatising the day after your arrival and exploring the surrounds, you will spend the next few days playing rounds at the Alpine Golf Resort, the Chiang Mai Highlands Golf Club and the Mae Jo Golf Club which is a fun course winding through a working fruit orchard. Tee off again at the Alpine and Highlands Clubs finishing with a presentation night. They offer a choice of five or 3.5-star accommodation and also single room prices.\n Be careful when using debit cards in foreign hotels. Picture: Thinkstock Source: Supplied\nQUICK DRAIN ON FUNDS\nDoc: Using your debit card overseas to pay for hotel stays can sometimes cause a potential problem. One reader has notified me of an unfortunate occurrence he encountered and I would like to share this with you.\nPlease feel free to let me know of any troubles, situations or dramas you have encountered when travelling, so we can help others avoid the same.\nThe reader writes: “I have used debit cards preloaded with particular foreign currencies for a number of our overseas trips since 2008 and while we have found them to be useful, there is one potential problem that is not widely known. As you would know, when checking into hotels most require a card of some sort as security. Generally, this is done as a pre-authorisation for a certain amount. If you use a credit card, the pre-authorisation amount isn’t actually charged to your card but somehow sits in the background and expires after a certain time (generally four to five working days). Thus, unless the pre-authorisation is actuated for some reason, you never see these amounts on your credit card statement.\nHowever, with a debit card, the pre-authorised amount is quarantined for those few days, which means the amount available to the card holder to use is reduced by the pre-authorisation amount. If it was a one-off thing this probably isn’t a big thing but if you checked in to five different hotels in five days and each had a pre-authority amount of $200, this would mean that $1000 of your funds would be tied up until the pre-authorities expired.\nThis could be a real problem especially if it was at the end of your trip when you wanted to spend all the foreign currency but couldn’t get access to it in time. This has happened to me and absolutely nothing can be done about it.”", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/765351-cbdeb952-2902-11e5-b088-701fc9b6d408.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/765272-45f3c36e-2902-11e5-b088-701fc9b6d408.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-19T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T11:46:36.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
