Carolyn Allsopp was dragged from the blazing office on the estate, which is the HQ of the Hurlingham Polo Association, after neighbours spotted smoke billowing from the roof but she was unable to be saved and died in hospital. The retired stockbroker was known to drink and smoke heavily in an annexe to her large country house, where she would spend evenings reading newspapers. Her brother-in-law, Edward Leigh-Pemberton, told the hearing that her 60-a-day cigarette habit meant the 57-year-old's ashtrays were overflowing and she had plastic carrier bags full of cigarette butts waiting to be thrown away. His father, Robin Leigh-Pemberton - better known as Lord Kingsdown - managed the Bank of England for a decade in the 1980s. • Lord Kingsdown - Obituary • Mervyn King: I feel liberated - I’m learning to foxtrot His appointment by Margaret Thatcher in 1983 with little experience comparable to his competitors was much criticised, although he was notably popular with bankers. He had just nine years at the National Westminster Bank, with six as chairman, when he was handed the top spot in the City. Oxford Coroner's Court heard how Ms Allsopp's newspaper delivery man noticed smoke billowing out of the eaves of her study building and raised the alarm. Neighbour Elisabeth Brown said she had been getting ready for work when the panicked delivery man knocked on her door and showed her the smoking building. \"He stood at the door and said he could see smoke coming from the office,\" she said. \"I went into the garden and could see smoke coming from the eaves.\" • Pressure for Hurlingham Polo Association to grant more recognition and support for women's polo • British Polo Day is driving a quiet revolution across the fields and business of polo Detectives who visited the scene of the fire at Manor Farm House in Little Coxwell, Faringdon, Oxon., did not treat the fire as suspicious and believed had been started by a stray cigarette catching some of the piles of newspapers. \"It appeared a cigarette may have set fire to some paperwork,\" Detective Sergeant Alun (corr) Watins said. The former stockbroker had issues with drinking, he said, which the family was trying to help her through, regularly checking up on her in person. Just days before her death he had called an ambulance for her when he found her slumped in an stupor after a heavy drinking session. Mrs Brown said she had last seen her neighbour at about 10.30pm the night before, spotting Ms Allsopp's silhouette in the study while she popped outside her house for a cigarette. \"Carolyn used the old office nearly every evening,\" she added. \"She used to be in there for hours, smoking, drinking and reading. \"She was quite a private person who wouldn't really talk about herself.\" Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T18:42:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
