Europe, the world’s most visited region, enjoyed continued strength with international arrivals rising by five per cent. \n\nAsia-Pacific’s arrivals grew by four per cent, with Oceania and North-east Asia leading with eight and five per cent respectively. South-east Asia’s arrivals grew by a modest three per cent, as the 25 per cent rebound in Thailand was offset by declines in other destinations. \n\nInternational arrivals in the Middle East are up by four per cent, further continuing the region’s recovery, which started in 2014, after three consecutive years of declines. Africa’s tourist numbers declined by about six per cent, a result caused mainly by the Ebola outbreak. \n\nClose to 500 million tourists are estimated to travel abroad between this May and August and prospects continue to be optimistic for this period, according to the UNWTO Tourism Confidence Index. \n\nBusiness intelligence tools ForwardKeys shows healthy growth in international air travel reservations for this period, with overall bookings up five per cent. Air reservations increased most in Asia-Pacific, the Americas and Europe. \n\nUNWTO expects international tourist arrivals to grow by three to four per cent for the full year 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T16:04:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
