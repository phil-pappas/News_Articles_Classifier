The conference will take place in EXPO XXI Warszawa, the ICCA member and the host of the event.\nThe annual ICCA CEC Summer Meeting is primarily an educational conference, which is why the hosts of this year’s meeting have put a strong emphasis on a richer program, whose motto is ‘Money makes the world go around’. The educational sessions are divided into two major panels and participants and invited guests will try to answer the two following questions:\nHow strategies for winning new business have changed over the years. Do money/finances play a role? Examples/Case studies of PCO/DMC, associations, a venue and a CVB. Why discounting does not work? Everyone is wondering how to promote their destinations, facilities, services etc. more effectively. Are price cuts an effective tool?\nIn the third part of the meeting Martin Sirk, ICCA CEO, will give a briefing and hold a Question & Answer session about ICCA’s new strategic plan, which will be presented at the upcoming congress. He will elaborate on why changes are being made, and what it will mean to members in terms of future business.\nICCA CEC Summer Meeting is not only an educational conference but also an important networking event. This is why we made sure that the participants are presented with many opportunities in order to establish new business relations during the Gala Dinner in Warsaw Royal Lazienki Parki and an interactive exploration of the Old Town or a boat trip on the Vistula River.\n- Anna Górska, ICCA Central European Chapter Chairperson.\nThe conference partners are Polish ICCA Members: Poland Convention Bureau POT, Warsaw Convention Bureau WOT, and Mazurkas Travel Congress and Conference Bureau.\nRelated Posts London goes up in the list of the world’s best convention cities Madrid becomes the second most popular conference city according to ICCA Austrian Airlines Financial Results as at 30 September 2013: Positive result gives optimism for break-even in 2013 TripAdvisor touches mark of 100 million downloads for free app for iPhone and Android TIA welcomes the New Zealand Story", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T20:07:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
