A very different cinematic experience can be enjoyed at Rome 's Cinecitta World where visitors explore sets and find themselves experiencing one illusion after another. It is claimed that 'the visitor becomes a protagonist for the day, becoming a star, becoming involved in some fake movie'. On top of that are the spectacular and very memorable rides such as a futuristic corkscrew rollercoaster connected to a spaceship and a water coaster in an ancient Roman film set. Located beside Cinecitta Studios where many major films have been made, Cinecetta World encourages visitors to use their imagination. You do not step into movies as at Disneyland - instead you take part and excite your imagination. All the staff are dressed as 'set technicians' constantly 'filming' a movie that never succeeds. \nAngela Youngman contributed this to MiniTime.
