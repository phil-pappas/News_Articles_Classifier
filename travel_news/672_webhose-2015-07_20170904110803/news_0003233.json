Tammy Zibners/The Tico Times \nForecasts from the National Meteorological Institute ( IMN ) state that a new tropical wave expected to arrive in Costa Rica on Wednesday will increase rains across most of the country in the coming hours. \nMeteorologist Rebeca Morera said the first rains are expected Tuesday evening in most of the country except for the lowlands of Guanacaste province, where dry conditions are expected to continue throughout the week. \nThe tropical wave, number 18 of the season, will cause partial cloudiness in most provinces and will favor higher temperatures and humidity levels during the mornings, IMN reported. \nCloud cover will increase during the evenings and will cause showers and thunderstorms mainly in the South and Central Pacific. Intermittent showers also are expected in the Central Valley, the northern region and the mountainous areas of the Caribbean region. \nMorera said rains over Guanacaste are only expected in some areas of the Nicoya Peninsula. \nPresident Luis Guillermo Solís began a tour Tuesday of several cantons of Guanacaste, which will celebrate the 191th anniversary of the annexation of Nicoya on Saturday. \nIn recent years, Guanacaste’s agricultural sector has suffered serious losses caused by drought and low rainfall levels and Solís is expected to announce the allocation of more emergency funds to help local producers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T21:48:46.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
