Right on schedule , United Airlines (NYSE: UAL) gave Chicago a sneak look at its new widebody Airbus 350 aircraft Friday afternoon. Airbus' latest creation, meant to compete with Chicago-based Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, won't enter United's fleet until 2018. But that didn't stop United from showing off the plane to invited guests and airline employees in a hangar at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport a full three years early. The A 350-1000 model United will get is a stretch version of the A 350-900 that already is part of the Qatar Airways fleet. American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) are expected be begin taking delivery of 900-series planes in 2017. But United Airlines will be the launch North American carrier for the stretch A 350-1000. Aside from its overall sleek appearance, the A 350's distinctive touches include its upturned winglets. The interior also sports upward-curving baggage compartments that help create a more spacious feeling. United's cabin configuration plans for the A 350-1000 are still being finalized, but there likely will be a premium and economy cabin layout. A United spokesman who toured the plane and took a short flight on the Airbus 350 last Friday described the experience this way: \"Fantastic aircraft. It felt like being in the future for 90 minutes.\" \nWant Chicago Travel  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T20:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T21:44:05.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
