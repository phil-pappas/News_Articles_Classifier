We’re working hard to reduce the waiting time.” \nIt said French authorities are dealing with migrant activity at the French terminal. \nMigrants invading the Eurotunnel terminal in Coquelles has become a nightly occurrence. \nThe migrant crisis in Calais, wildcat strike action by ferry workers and protesting farmers mean truckers are spending hours stuck in queues in Kent and northern France. \nThere were delays to the service on Thursday when the body of a suspected migrant was found on the roof of a Eurotunnel train at the Chunnel terminal in Folkestone. \nThe news came as video footage emerged apparently showing migrants travelling to Britain on empty freight train carriages. \nA number of people are seen in an otherwise empty carriage which arrived in Folkestone earlier this month, in footage from a worker obtained by The Sun. \nAn estimated 5,000 migrants displaced from countries including Syria, Libya and Eritrea are now believed to be camped in and around Calais. \nFreight transport chiefs said Britain’s freight industry is losing £750,000 a day because of the huge problems lorry drivers have faced this summer trying to cross the Channel. \nOperation Stack – where freight traffic is queued on sections of the M20 when cross-Channel services are disrupted – remains in place, and Kent Police warned it could continue until at least tomorrow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T03:04:12.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
