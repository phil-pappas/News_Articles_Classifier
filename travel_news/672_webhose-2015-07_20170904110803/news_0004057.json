He is well. Thank you,” Bardiani tweeted.\nIntervención quirúrgica por fisura de cadera. Se encuentra muy bien. Gracias\n— Karina Bardiani (@drakgb) July 22, 2015\nGarcía, 63, also suffered a gastrointestinal disorder last week, which forced him to check in to the hospital. After recovering, and before he was discharged, he offered an improvised concert for other patients, doctors and nurses.\n“Due to inexact rumors, we report that Charly García was scheduled a month ago to undergo programmed surgery,” Bardiani said Wednesday about the musician’s new hospital admission.\nThe author of classics of Argentine progressive rock such as “Inconsciente colectivo,” “De mí” and “Rezo por vos” overcame in 2008 a severe drug addiction and psychiatric crisis.\nDetox and recovery treatment was intensive, and he was away from the stage for a long period.\nIn 2009 in Las Vegas, he was awarded the Latin Recording Academy’s Musical Excellence Grammy.\nA leader of historic bands such as Sui Generis, Serú Girán and La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros, he is considered a pioneer in the “national rock” movement and one of the composers who revolutionized the genre.\nAmong his most memorable concerts are one in 1988 at River Plate’s Estadio Monumental, in Buenos Aires, with Bruce Springsteen, Peter Gabriel and Sting.\nIn 2013, he took his show “Líneas Paralelas” to Teatro Colón, one of the most important lyric halls on the continent, as well as in Buenos Aires.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=RDeWwCD6UvwGo", "https://twitter.com/drakgb/status/623698875258421248"], "published": "2015-07-23T03:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T16:22:54.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
