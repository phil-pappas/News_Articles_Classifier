Inside lava, Icelandic wool, reworked wood, recycled cardboard are all used to furnish rooms. \nPerhaps one of the most fascinating use of materials is the rubber tyre turned washroom sink. PH The bar offers fantastic views of the landscape \nIn keeping with the island's emphasis on preserving its natural beauty, bathroom products are made from Icelandic herbs while bed linen and the restaurant is organic and fair trade. \nSpeaking of which the restaurant is aiming to be Iceland's first with a Michelin star. \nDelicacies such as reindeer, locally caught Arctic char and skyr – homemade yoghurt – smoked bone marrow ice-cream are crafted by dedicated chefs for hours but can polished off in minutes. \nGuests are offered a range activities from horse riding in mountains around Oflus, Sólheimajökull glacier tours, rafting, hot spring hikes and even the chance to experience the tectonic plates up close through snorkelling and diving trips to Silfra. \nThe less active can opt for sightseeing excursions such as the Golden Circle. \nThis includes the waterfall Gullfoss and the geothermally active valley of Haukadalur, containing the Strokkur geyser – erupting every five to 10 minutes wowing crowds. \nOwner Sigurlaug Sverrisdóttir, who was born and raised in the region said the Northern Lights never get old. \n\"This respect for Mother Nature is in our blood; our parents and grandparents certainly knew not to mess with her.,\" she said. \n'I still feel amazed when I see the Northern Lights dancing in the sky on one of my late returns from work. \n\"Even though you have experienced it several times before it is different when you are outside of the city, it's much more intense.\" \nFor more information visit oniceland.is and gogreen.is Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T07:18:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
