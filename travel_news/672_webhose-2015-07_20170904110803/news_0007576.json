The rest, almost 20 percent, is generated by nuclear power plants.\nIn the video, Clinton said future generations will ask “what were we thinking?”\n“I’m just a grandmother with two eyes and a brain and I know what’s happening in the world is going to have a big effect on my daughter and especially on my granddaughter.\n“It’s hard to believe there are people running for president who still refuse to accept the settled science of climate change,” she said.\nOn how she plans to accomplish her goals, Clinton proposes giving states, towns and rural communities financial incentives to fight climate change, either by placing more stringent curbs on emissions than the law requires or through stepped up investments in renewable energy.\nClimate change is a hyper partisan issue in the United States, with many Republicans questioning whether human activity is contributing to global warming.\nIn Congress, the Republican majority has fought anti-pollution standards put in place by President Barack Obama, notably for coal-fueled power plants.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T23:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:52:52.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
