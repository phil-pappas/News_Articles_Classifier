Massachusetts state police said troopers arrested 48-year-old Darren Halliwell, of Aspull, after the Houston-bound British Airways flight landed at Logan International Airport around noon Wednesday. Halliwell was charged with interfering with a flight crew. Police said it took multiple passengers to restrain him. Authorities say Halliwell allegedly assaulted a woman who was traveling with him. More charges could be filed. A statement released by British Airways says customers and crew shouldn't have to suffer any form of abuse. The airline says such behavior will not be tolerated. Authorities say the plane continued to Houston after Halliwell was arrested. He is expected to be arraigned on Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T04:01:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
