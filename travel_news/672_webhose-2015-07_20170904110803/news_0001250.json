The H5N1 strain has caused the death of tens of millions of poultry and losses of tens of billions of dollars. \nAvian flu in West Africa could trigger a mass “die-off” of chicken – a nutritious and inexpensive source of food for many people – with detrimental impacts on diets and on the economy of the region, exacerbating an already difficult situation, the agency said. \n“We're looking at a disease – H5N1 – that has already spread to five countries in six months. We have to make a concerted effort to stop it in its tracks and we have to do it now,” Mr. Lubroth said. FAO is appealing for $20 million for prevention and response to bolster weak veterinary systems, improve the capabilities of local laboratories and putting FAO specialists on the ground in affected and at-risk countries. \nBecause the disease can be transmitted to humans and is considered highly lethal, FAO said it is working closely with the World Health Organization (WHO) on country assessments, contingency plans, offering technical assistance and investigating potential flu cases and the source of infection.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T07:00:34.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
