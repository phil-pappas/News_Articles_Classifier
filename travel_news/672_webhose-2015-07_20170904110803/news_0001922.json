That’s pretty good.”\n Williams served 13 aces, including three in the final game, had 29 winners and never faced a break point in overpowering the fourth-seeded Sharapova, who hit six double-faults and couldn’t find a way to cope with her rival’s relentless pace.\n“When she stepped up her game, I was able to step up mine as well,” Williams said.\nIt will be Williams’ first appearance in the Wimbledon final since 2012, when she won her fifth title at the All England Club.\n“I think it definitely gets better,” she said. “It’s been a long time since I’ve been in the final here. I just feel really good just to be in another final, so it’s really cool.”\nWilliams’ opponent will be 21-year-old Garbine Muguruza, who beat Agnieszka Radwanska 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 in the first semifinal. She’s the first Spanish woman to advance to the Wimbledon final since Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in 1996.\nWilliams has won two out her three matches against Muguruza, but the Spaniard beat her 6-2, 6-2 in the second round of the French Open last year. That was Williams’ most lopsided loss in a Grand Slam.\n“It’s great for her. It’s great for me,” Williams said. “She actually beat me before. She made me improve, so she has me on my toes. It’s not going to be an easy match, so I’ll be fighting a lot.”\nWilliams is unbeaten in majors since winning last year’s U.S. Open and this year’s Australian and French Opens. A win here would match the “Serena Slam” she achieved in 2002-03. Williams would then need to win the U.S. Open to complete a true Grand Slam, a sweep of all four majors in the same year, something which hasn’t been accomplished since Steffi Graf did it in 1988.\nWilliams is also one win away from a 21st Grand Slam title, one short of the Open era record held by Graf.\nWilliams extended her career record against Sharapova to 18-2. Sharapova beat Williams in the 2004 Wimbledon final for her first Grand Slam title, but the rivalry has been one-sided for more than a decade.\n“I always expect her to play the best tennis against myself and a few other elite players,” Sharapova said. “She does always come up with great tennis. You have to be able not to just produce your best tennis, but more. Obviously it hasn’t happened for me.”\nThe tone in Saturday’s match was set early when Sharapova double-faulted three times in the opening game, giving Williams the break. Williams needed just over 30 minutes to take the first set.\nSharapova made things tighter in the second set but double-faulted again on break point to give Williams a 3-2 lead. Williams served out the match at love with the three aces and a service winner that Sharapova barely got her racket on.\nEarlier, Muguruza lost six games in a row in one stretch but regrouped against Radwanska. The Spaniard, who saved two break points in the final game, dropped face-first onto the grass on Centre Court after hitting a swinging forehand volley for a winner on her first match point.\n“I don’t have words to explain it,” she said. “Just happy. I worked all my life to achieve this moment, so no words.”\nAt deuce in the final game, Radwanska held up her racket in the middle of the point to challenge a backhand from Muguruza that landed near the baseline. Radwanska had already hit a forehand return, and only challenged after her ball had bounced on the other side of the net and Muguruza lined up her next shot.\nThe video replay showed the ball had caught the back of the line, giving the point to the Spaniard. Radwanska looked in the direction of where her coach was sitting and gestured as if they had made a mistake in challenging the call.\n“It was 50-50 call. I decided to challenge,” Radwanska said. “Wasn’t really good decision.”\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show that Williams has won 27 straight Grand Slam matches, not 26.\nSTEPHEN WILSON", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T18:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T14:16:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
