Hardly touched: The Old City Hall subway station. Picture: Metropolitan Transportation Authority / Patrick Cashin Source: Supplied \nIT WAS designed to be the showpiece of New York City’s first subway system, dubbed “the jewel in the crown”, yet thousands of people walk above this beautiful time capsule every day, clueless about its existence. \nNew York’s first ever train station, City Hall, is buried underneath the city’s oldest government building, but since its closure in 1945, few have walked along the station’s elegant platform or glanced their eyes upon its breathtaking design. \nOpened on October 27, 1904, New York City’s debut route — dubbed the Manhattan Main Line — began at City Hall and travelled north to Grand Central Terminal, through Times Square and up to 145th Street. At its peak, City Hall station was the flagship of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company’s subway line.

Now that’s class. \n“The night took on a carnival atmosphere, like New Year’s Eve,” writes Clifton Hood in his book, 722 Miles: The Building of the Subways and how they transformed New York .

Revelling in the sheer novelty of the underground, these riders wanted to soak up its unfamiliar sights and sensations for as long as possible.” Financiers, city officials, and policemen ride New York City's first subway on October 27, 1904 at City Hall station. Seated toward the front of the ceremonial flat car were Alexander Orr, August Belmont II, John B. McDonald, and Mayor George B. McClellan.

Oak furnishings and glazed plaques inscribed with “City Hall” rest barely untouched today. \nSo intricate is the detail, its light bulbs were designed with treads in the reverse direction to prevent theft. The station owes its breathtaking design to architects George Lewis Heins and Christopher Grant LaFarge.

Picture: Metropolitan Transportation Authority / Marc Hermann Source: Supplied \nYet in the 1940s, as more subway stations were built, City Hall came to a grinding halt, failing to match the standards of newer stops that could hold more commuters and accommodate longer trains. \nPassenger numbers dwindled, and with the bigger and better Brooklyn Bridge station close by, officials deemed City Hall a thorn in the subway’s side, and closed it to the public on December 31, 1945. \nIt was the end of form over function. The station soon became obsolete and is no longer in service.

But there are ways . \nIf you have the money to spend, visitors can sign up to become a member of the New York City Transit Museum and purchase tickets for a Jewel in the Crown: Old City Hall Station members-only tour. \nThe Museum only offers around two tours a month, with tickets released seasonally. That’s approximately eight tours per season. The next round of tickets will go on sale in mid-August. Tour dates, times and the on-sale date are released in the e-newsletter . \nBut you’ve got to be quick. When tickets go on sale, the entire season generally sells out within an hour. \nTour tickets to the Old City Hall Station and other tours are available for purchase here . The original architects of this space designed the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.
