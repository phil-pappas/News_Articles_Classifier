Here are some tips from AAA: Those all-important tires • Check and adjust tire pressures to the vehicle manufacturer’s recommended settings – check your owner’s manual or door jamb for these numbers, and don’t forget the spare, if you have one. Inspect the tire sidewalls for bulges, and check the tread for excessive or uneven wear that indicates the need for wheel alignment and/or tire replacement. • For maximum life, rotate your tires at the mileage interval specified in your owner’s manual. Note that some vehicles use differently-sized tires front and rear that cannot be rotated.
