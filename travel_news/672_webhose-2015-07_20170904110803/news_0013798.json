My partner tried to keep me captive by way of bribes. Offers of a stone cottage, a Bernese Mountain Dog puppy, a wedding in an old church: there was nothing he wouldn't try to stay in his newfound homeland. Central has that absurd effect on people; its watercolour landscape captures the imagination and tugs at an unknown chord hidden within the most stoic Auckland heart. \nBeautiful as the landscape is, there's also a list of attributes that make the residents of Central Otago as special as its golden hills. There are two traits, in particular, that tempt visitors to join them: they make damn good wine and they genuinely love their land. The relationship between man and his patch survives the blistering heat of summer and the nose-aching cold of winter – extreme in a way only Alexandra can pull off. The hills are buried beneath snow, cooked by furnace-like heat and chomped by rabbits with a death wish; they have seen vines stretch their tendrils and vintages come and go. \nThey get it, these people. They nod knowingly as I try to describe the beauty of the Pisa Range with its icing-sugar smattering of snow, and smile with only a hint of smugness when I tell them about my slow jog along Lake Dunstan, hindered by stopping to take pointless photos of the sun bouncing off the water. Cheree Phillips \nThe postcard perfect Cromwell Heritage Precinct. \nIt's easy to forget what lies beneath the lake. For those like myself, hatched too late to remember the 1980s' news broadcasts and the impassioned protests of heartsick residents, it's a hard picture to paint. How is it that at the foothills of the ranges, beneath mirror-still waters, lie the remains of a town? It took more than a dam to stop them, these hardy people. They dried themselves off and kept going. \nLike the vines that line the hills, Cromwell experienced new growth. Drawing on the energy of the land, it reappeared bigger and better than ever. Tourists came, tempted by roadside stalls of dried apricots and wineries with priceless views and some never left, converted by big skies and misty mornings. \n1) OLD CROMWELL TOWN Jane Ussher \nThe May/June issue of NZ Life & Leisure is on sale until 6 July. \nNot all the original buildings met their watery end with the building of the Clyde dam and subsequent filling of Lake Dunstan; some relocated to The Cromwell Heritage Precinct, a quaint recreation of the original town. Others remain semi-standing on the lakefront, a ghost town of half-submerged buildings. Visitors can wander down to the water and stroll by the buried, broken schoolhouse or stick their feet into the lake and imagine what lies at its dark depths – our very own version of the lost city of Atlantis. cromwellheritageprecinct.co.nz \n2) HIGHLANDS MOTORSPORT PARK. \nIf turning rabbit-riddled paddocks into thriving businesses is a Cromwell specialty, there is no better example than Highlands Motorsport Park. \nThe amount of energy, money and ideas crammed into one piece of land on the outskirts of town makes a visitor's head spin – at least that was the excuse I used for mistakenly driving around the go-kart track backwards. With so much to take in, I was clearly distracted. \nThe brainchild of Australian pet-food magnate and businessman Tony Quinn, Highlands is a motoring museum, restaurant, winery and apartment complex, with a go-kart and race track that offer driver experiences. It's also the site of the only traffic lights in Cromwell. The $31 million project is entirely privately funded and was built from scratch in a single year, growing from the seasoned soil with the determination necessary for Central Otago projects. It's quirky, a little bit left of centre. With an upcoming dinosaur park, an aroma room called The Nose (complete with a giant schnozz on the exterior), life-sized animals of both the stuffed and sculptured variety as well as a world-class racetrack with some of the world's best and rarest super-cars , Highlands is what I imagine the dream backyard of a Powerball winner would look like. Corner SH6 and Sandflat Road, Cromwell (look for The Nose). highlands.co.nz \n3) FOR THE LOVE OF VINES \nLike my star-struck partner, wine lovers appear to be the most easily swayed. Warwick and Jenny Hawker had been following Warwick's diplomatic postings from Iran to Hong Kong and everywhere in between for 30 years when they decided they might like to have a go at growing grapes. They purchased a block of land on the Pisa Range and went about sowing seeds and plucking fruit off vines – getting the sun on their gumboots. In 2014 the Pisa Range Estate 2012 Black Poplar Block pinot noir won double gold at the Six Nations Wine Challenge – not a bad effort for a tiny boutique vineyard. pisarangeestate.co.nz \nTheir winemaker, Rudi Bauer of Quartz Reef, is cut from the same cloth. When he first set foot on the 40-hectare Bendigo plot there was nothing but rabbits and fresh air. Although it is now transformed into an award-winning vineyard, Rudi credits the land for giving his methode traditionelle its sparkle. \"The wine has no history but the land does. I've followed the land and worked with what it's given me.\" The land isn't the only magic at work; each bottle of bubbly is handled 200 times before being placed in the eager grasp of the buyer.
