A Swivel Seat is a solution that enables wheelchair users to do this. Autoadapt, Swedish manufacturer of vehicle adaptation solutions , now introduces a new version of their Turny Evo , t he first of two new swivel seats from Autoadapt to hit the market this year. The key feature of the Turny Evo, helping both drivers and passengers to get seated, remains the same with some major improvements in comfort, ease of use, installation and, most important, safety. (Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150702/227726 ) Peter Wahlsten , Executive Vice President at Autoadapt explains why: \" We firmly believe that everyone should be entitled to the same safety, but when you travel in a vehicle seated in a wheelchair you have already accepted a lower degree of safety . W ithout proper head and neck support it is practically as bad as not wearing a seat belt at all. \"All Autoadapt swivel seats are crash tested and approved according to the same standards that apply to the automotive industry, a 20 G crash with a 76 kg crash test dummy. With the new Turny Evo and the coming Turny Low Vehicle, the company pushes beyond the standard with successful crash tests at 30 G with a 102 kg crash test dummy. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T10:44:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
