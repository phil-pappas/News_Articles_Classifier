Some of the other new features include free preset and custom touring plan functionality for all parks, activity lists that allow guests to view and check off attractions they’ve already visited and daily wait time curves for each attraction. \nUndercover Tourist CEO Ian Ford released a statement about the upgrades to the app: \n“We are always looking for innovative and creative ways to make family travel easier. The new app includes every planning tool needed to hit the ground running on the perfect family vacation. I’m particularly excited that we’re offering preset touring plans created with families in mind – they just select a plan and go or they can tailor the plans to their own preferences. For families who like to sleep-in on vacation, we outline the best times to visit every ride, show and character within the parks.” \nThe app also tells patrons when rides are closed or undergoing service, eliminating more possibly wasted time. The goal was to maximize the user’s time at the parks, and the Undercover Tourist team used customer feedback to design the new and improved app. \nFor the families and diehard amusement park fans out there, this is the kind of app that helps avoid wasted time inside some of the most entertaining places on earth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T12:44:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
