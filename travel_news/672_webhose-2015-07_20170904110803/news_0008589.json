The name supposedly comes from the local Kohler Co., which made fountains with a \"bubbling valve\" in the middle of the bowl in 1915. People started calling the things \"bubblers,\" and the term was soon applied to any drinking fountain. (Also, while this is mostly a WI word, it pops up in Portland and pockets of New England as well.) Should we all start using it? It's shorter and more whimsical than \"water fountain,\" so sure, why not! Cattywampus The South What it means: All out of sorts, askew, craaaazy. Should we all start using it? If it's good enough for Mr. Krabs, it's good enough for us. Pre-funk Pacific Northwest What it means: Pre-game. As in, drinking before another event that likely involves more drinking. Should we all start using it? Obviously the rest of the country already has a word for that, but \"funk\" is more appealing than \"game,\" so let's go for it. Tump (over) Texas What it means: To tip, fall, or spill over. While some people peg this term solely to Texas, it also has a big following in Arkansas and other Southern states. Should we all start using it? It is kinda funny that it's practically an onomatopoeia of the action ( thump ), and since we've been hung up on onomatopoeia since that one spelling bee, we're going to say yes. Shoots Hawaii What it means: A general affirmative, like \"yeah.\" Can be followed with \"then\" or \"brah.\" One of the more all-purpose words from Hawaii's pidgin slang. Should we all start using it? Shoots, brah. Trixie Chicago, IL What it means: As we've previously explained, a \"Trixie\" is a former sorority sister who lives in Lincoln Park, organizes bar crawls, and dates a Chad (the male version of her). Should we all start using it? It's incredibly specific to the area, so probably not. But you're welcome to try. \nLeaf peepers New England What it means: Those tourists who come to take selfies with all the fall foliage. Sometimes it's used affectionately. Sometimes it's not. Should we all start using it? The word \"peepers\" sounds downright filthy in any context, even if we're talking about trees. (Or the formal cat name, Mr. Peepers.)
