Five years ago, he started a pop-up food club. \nThe star ingredients he chose: offal, or the organs and other parts of animals that often end up in the garbage. \nTripes Caviar gained a cult-like following with Leblond’s inventive use of tongue, brains, heart, tripe, lungs, and even eyeballs. Two years ago he opened a brick-and-mortar establishment of the same name. \n“We were the underdogs two years ago,” says the 28-year-old chef. “We didn’t add a tuna tartare or a burger.” \nLeblond is part of a new generation of Montreal chefs putting a different spin on cooking methods that have been around for thousands of years. There was a time when offal was a staple of any dish. But as supermarkets replaced small butcher shops, and North Americans became more affluent, offal virtually disappeared from diets. \nBut this is Montreal, a city that takes food seriously. It’s got the largest number of restaurants per capita in all of Canada, and perhaps some of the most adventurous eaters. Ten years ago, co-owners David McMillan and Frederic Morin helped usher in a new era of bold use of animal parts with the opening of Joe Beef . On my visit there, a menu written on a chalkboard in French advertised dishes such as veal liver with foie gras. \nBut for many chefs, head-to-tail cooking is also a matter of sustainability. \n“We try to maximize the fruit, we try to maximize the fish, we maximize everything,” says Normand Laprise, a James Beard Award-winning chef and cookbook author. “We have so much waste. In 30 years, we won’t have the same amount of food,” \nLaprise’s 22-year-old Montreal restaurant Toque! often tops lists of best Canadian restaurants with its creative use of meats and ingredients grown on local farms. \n“We were fed by what we found on the farm,” he says of eating and cooking decades ago. “We didn’t have a supermarket.” \nLaprise says he is encouraged that younger chefs are embracing techniques that were hardly in practice when they were growing up. \n“Montreal is a city of creativity,” he says. \nAt relatively new Manitoba , 25-year-old chef Chris Parasiuk is reviving an ancient cooking tradition. He’s foraging for many ingredients, finding edibles wherever he can outdoors, even the alley behind his restaurant. It’s a style he’s likening to campfire cooking. \nOn a cold March night, sous-chef Rebecca-Jane Wilson translates the French menu for me, which is written on a chalkboard in the minimalist but warm dining room. I stop her when she mentions cedar as the ingredient in one dish. Yes, she says, they fry the bark. Raw deer comes with fried lichen, a dish I never would have imagined trying. With his training, I have no doubt that Parasiuk knows what is safe to eat. \n“Every week, there’s new things that pop up,” Parasiuk says. “There’s so many different things in the forest that you can eat that people don’t know about.” \nThe regularly evolving menu also incorporates head-to-tail ingredients such as deer kidneys, deer heart and pork tongue. Cooking such ingredients is not easy, Parasiuk admits. \n“There’s less room for error,” he says. \nAt Lawrence , a casual yet chic restaurant with a butcher shop attached to it, chef Marc Cohen says he likes the dynamic nature of cooking with an entire animal. \n“We don’t write the menu and order the stuff,” he says. “We have to order our animals months in advance. We make the menu based on what we have. It keeps people more stimulated.” \nAnd that’s ultimately what food is about, says Tripes Caviar’s Leblond. During brunch there this winter, I am both terrified and excited by the pig tail taco with corn relish, feta and black beans that the waitress sets down on my table. A version of Eggs Benedict with Wagyu beef tongue ends up putting Canadian bacon to shame. \n“Going out to eat is about emotion,” Leblond says. “There’s so much emotion in offal. There’s so much texture and flavor and stories behind it. A burger is not old. But a tripe ragu is centuries old.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T11:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T13:10:59.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
