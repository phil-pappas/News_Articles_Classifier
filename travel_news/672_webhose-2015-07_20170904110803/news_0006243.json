Mr Edwards told MailOnline Travel that Durdle Door was one of this favourite images in the collection.\nHe said: 'Durdle Door was a tricky 360 to produce. I'd travelled five hours to get to the location but only had a few minutes to create the shot. I set up my tripod and 360 kit near to the water's edge only to be unexpectedly soaked by a huge wave. It was mid-March and the water was ice cold,' he said.\n'Back at my studio, retouching all the footprints in the shingle and all the waves between all of the frames was a pain but the final result is worth all the effort,' he added.\nPortmeirion\nTo see the 360-degree version of this picture click here\nShades of the Mediterranean:The multi-coloured buildings and stylised architecture create the impression of an Italian village in Wales\nWarwick Castle, The Great Hall\nTo see the 360-degree version of this picture click here\nGolden Age: Several suits of armour and a huge cauldron are on display in this imposing regal space\nAnne Hathaway's Cottage, The Parlour\nTo see the 360-degree version of this picture click here\nPristine condition: Anne Hathaway's Stratford upon Avon home has low beams and period decorations lining the walls\nDurham Cathedral\nTo see the 360-degree version of this picture click here\nImpressive grandeur: Detailed stain glass windows and a cavernous structure cement the cathedral's status as a World Heritage Site\nFrustrated that visitors tend to spend most of their time in London, VisitBritain hopes that Edwards' amazing photographs will encourage them to explore the rest of the nation.\nJoss Croft, Marketing Director at VisitBritain said: 'Not only will this immersive experience allow potential visitors to snoop around some of our greatest tourist attractions before they arrive, but it will inspire and motivate more travel across the country.\n'London is a huge global asset for Britain – a dynamic, cosmopolitan and well-connected city that visitors aspire to visit.\n'Our challenge is to encourage visitors to add to their holiday experience by exploring even more during their short time here and making sure they know how easy it is to get around.'\nCardiff Castle, The Arab Room\nTo see the 360-degree version of this picture click here\nOpulence: A kaleidoscopic roof of stain glass and gold creates a vivid ambience in The Arab Room\nRosslyn Chapel\nTo see the 360-degree version of this picture click here\nCelestial sounds: The choir sing and candles flicker in this dizzying spin around the embellished chapel\nAnne Hathaway's Cottage,The Broad Solar Bedroom\nTo see the 360-degree version of this picture click here\nIntimate insight: Viewers can take a sneak peek into one of Anne Hathaway's bedrooms\nSalisbury Cathedral\nTo see the 360-degree version of this picture click here\nLofty solitude: The echoing serenity of this place of worship in Wiltshire is conveyed in panorama\nInternational tourism continues to deliver huge economic benefits across the country, and the last two years have seen almost all other parts of the UK grow faster than London.
