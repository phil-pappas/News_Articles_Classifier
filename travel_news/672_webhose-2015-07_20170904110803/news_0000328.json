While the comforts of heat, electricity, and a plush bed in the cabins suffice, there is an element of “roughing it,” as none of the cabins have bathroom facilities. The grounds share one bathhouse with toilets and showers for all guests, akin to a campground. The cabins vary in size and design, but expect well-outfitted interiors filled with antique furniture and fun accents on the walls. With its short supply of cabins and high demand, be sure to plan more than a year in advance for your stay. \nPlan Your Trip: Visit Fodor’s Seattle Travel Guide Photo Credit: Courtesy of Cedar Creek Treehouse Cedar Creek Treehouse \nWhere: Ashford, Washington \nAscend five stories above the forest floor to the Cedar Creek Treehouse , where you'll enjoy breathtaking views. Completed in 1982 by Bill Compher as a home for his wife and baby daughter, the Treehouse has been operating as a one-room hotel since 1995. The cottage is perched on a 250-year-old Western Red Cedar and incorporates the tree’s trunks and branches throughout the rooms. Untethered views of Mount Rainier and the surrounding green backwoods delight, along with the recently added wooden-plank Rainbow Bridge to the Observatory, a 360-degree viewing platform raised 100 feet high. \nPlan Your Trip: Visit Fodor’s Washington Travel Guide Photo Credit: Courtesy of Wheatleigh Hotel The Aviary at Wheatleigh Hotel \nWhere: Lenox, Massachusetts \nLuxury meets nature-chic at The Aviary , Wheatleigh Hotel ‘s top-of-the-line, two-story treetop suite. Formerly an aviary, this design-forward hideaway has been retrofitted to feature expansive windows, a custom-built winding staircase, and a disarming antique soaking tub. Take the time to descend from the treetops and make use of the resort’s expansive 22 acres, where no stay is complete without a visit to the immaculate wine cellar and the picture-perfect pool. Come summer, Wheatleigh hosts a weekly Wednesday night barbecue, serving a high-end al fresco experience with grilled lobster, day boat scallops, and swordfish. \nPlan Your Trip: Visit Fodor’s Berkshires Travel Guide Photo Credit: Courtesy of Winvian Farm The Treehouse at Winvian Farm \nWhere: Litchfield Hills, Connecticut \nYou won’t soon forget a night in the Treehouse at Winvian Farm , one of the eighteen unique cottages on the 113-acre property in the Litchfield Hills of Connecticut. A stay in the Treehouse starts with an ascent up the color-canopied staircase to the main entrance, 35 feet from the forest floor. With two floors, the cottage features a king-size bed and sofa pullout, along with luxurious amenities including two fireplaces, a steam shower, and a Jacuzzi. With a full bar on site as well, a night in the 780-square-foot property makes for the perfect celebratory toast. \nPlan Your Trip: Visit Fodor’s Connecticut Travel Guide Photo Credit: Courtesy of Out'n'About Treehouses Out'n'About Treehouse Treesort \nWhere: Cave Junction, Oregon \nThere’s a commonality at the Out'n'About Treehouse Treesort that creates fast friends among the nightly tenants of its twelve world-class tree houses: All guests have waited for this night for upward of a year—the furthest advance booking allowed. Each tree house is unique and sparingly decorated with a rustic, camping feel, and the Treesort is modeled as a bed and breakfast with the events and scope of a resort. With plenty of activities to fill the day, from horseback riding to an extensive zip-line course, you’ll want to make sure to carve some time out to marvel at the structures suspended in the trees or sit back in your high post and take in the view. \nPlan Your Trip: Visit Fodor’s Oregon Travel Guide", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T10:58:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
