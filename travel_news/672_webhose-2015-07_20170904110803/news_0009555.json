People have been getting together at the Kamogawa river to cool off for uncounted generations. The sound of the stream and the blowing breeze are comfortable there. Terraces called noryo-yuka, or “cooling floors,” appear above the river’s west bank only during the summer. There, visitors can enjoy Kyoto cuisine, which attracts tourists from other prefectures as well as overseas. Raised platforms for about 100 restaurants and shops are built in a row on the same level. Noryo-yuka are temporary structures elevated above the ground, construction of which is permitted on a section of riverbank along the Kamogawa between the Nijo Ohashi bridge and the Gojo Ohashi bridge on the west bank from May through September every year. These terraces extend toward the river, not only from restaurants serving Kyoto cuisine but also Chinese and Western-style establishments and cafes. Some visitors hire geiko (the western Japanese term for traditional hostesses called geisha elsewhere) and maiko (apprentice geisha) to entertain them. After the sun goes down, the Minamiza Kabuki theater lights up on the opposite bank, and beyond that, the ridge of the Higashiyama mountains are silhouetted against the evening sky. The origin of these terraces is linked to the Gion Matsuri festival, during which this year’s Yamaboko Junko grand procession is set to be held on July 17 (for details, see event-carnival.com/japan/gion-matsuri). Before the procession, people carry mikoshi, or portable shrines, across the Kamogawa river from Gion shrine, now called Yasaka Shrine, located east of the river. For this purpose, a temporary bridge was set up during the festival from the late Heian period (from the late eighth century to the late 12th century) through the Kamakura period (from the late 12th century to the early 14th century). A ceremony called mikoshi-arai (mikoshi purification) to clean and purify the mikoshi with river water took place at the foot of the bridge. Many people gathered to see the bridge and mikoshi. Shops, tearooms and benches came to be set up around the shallow water of the river to serve spectators. This was the origin of the noryo-yuka floors. In his 1662 book “Annaisha” (Guide), author Nakagawa Kiun describes temporary stores that were open during the Gion festival. He writes of the lively atmosphere, “At the Shijogawara riverbank, there are floors of tea houses up to Sanjo, and many people in Kyoto come to cool off in the evening.” He added that candy sellers and grilled tofu were also part of the scene. Opening hours were then extended, and the elevated floors appeared. According to the mid-18th century “Zaikyo Nikki” (Diary of a stay in Kyoto) by Motoori Norinaga, “Until Aug. 1 [of the lunar calendar], there are floors of teahouses on the river for cooling off, which makes the riverside very crowded.” Yasuhisa Kitamura, 57, a restaurant owner and executive director of a cooperative association for the Kamogawa noryo-yuka, said, “Although the style changes, the tradition of welcoming guests remains the same.” Floors scattered in the river itself and on both of its banks came to be more neatly arranged from the Meiji era (1868-1912). The construction of the Kamogawa Canal and extension work on the Keihan Railway made it impossible to set up floors on the east side of the river. Sand banks were banned for flood-control reasons, and benches were not allowed to be placed there. Then, in 1935, the floors were swept away by a flood. During the period from the Sino-Japanese War to World War II, the floors died out, being regarded as an indulgent luxury. They came back in 1951 when workers improved the riverbed to counteract floods. Floors were allowed to be built on the west bank if they were elevated. Though these new terraces were a little distant from the river, they were arranged directly above the Misosogigawa, a narrow waterway that flows alongside the Kamogawa. “Please pay attention to the Misosogigawa to get a better sense of water itself,” suggests Professor Masashi Kawasaki of Kyoto University, who is familiar with the landscape. Sipping sake while listening to the sound of the stream is one way to enjoy the summer in Kyoto. The area currently called Gion, on the east side of the Kamogawa river, became known as the Hanamachi entertainment district early in the Edo period (1603-1867). It’s said that the origins of the district were dancing and singing performances given at Gion shrine by the waitresses at tea houses where voyagers stopped to rest. At about that time, another Hanamachi district was established, named Ponto, on the west side. Izumo no Okuni, the woman credited with creating Kabuki, is said to have performed her “Kabuki Odori” dance at a temporary playhouse on the Kamogawa river. During the Genna era (1615-1624), seven Kabuki theaters were clustered in the Shijogawara area. In addition to the Minamiza theater, which holds performances today, the Kitaza theater used to stand north of Shijo-dori avenue. In anticipation of visitors to these spots, more than 400 floors were said to have been built each summer. For more information on Kyoto, go to www.kyoto.travel/en .
