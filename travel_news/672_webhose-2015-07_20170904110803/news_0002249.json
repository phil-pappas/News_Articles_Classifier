The CLT flights are among eight new routes announced by American Airlines on Monday . The Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier also added service to locales in the Caribbean, Mexico and Latin America from its hubs in Dallas, Los Angeles and Chicago. And the company plans to reinstate a flight from New York to Venezuela, according to its news release. This marks just the latest international route expansion for American, the world's largest airline by operations since the late-2013 closing of its merger with US Airways. CLT had largely been left out of those announcements as the carrier shifted its focus at the local hub, the second-largest in its network, to connecting with smaller, domestic markets. Last week, for instance, American added a twice-daily, nonstop flight from Charlotte to Springfield, Mo. As a result, international traffic at Charlotte Douglas has declined 4% this year through May, compared with the same five-month period of last year. However, overall traffic is up about 1% from a year ago. American is by far the dominant carrier at CLT, operating some 90 percent of local air traffic under its legacy and US Airways banner. The latter will soon be just a memory, with its final flights scheduled for October and aircraft slated to be repainted in less than a year. \nWant Charlotte Logistics & Transportation news in your inbox?
