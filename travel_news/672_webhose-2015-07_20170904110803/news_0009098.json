We are ecstatic to continue pioneering new areas of luxury travel Tan Sri Lim Kok, Crystal's chairman \nThe cruise line's president and CEO, Edie Rodriguez, said: \"We continue to think bigger, aiming to create unparalleled luxury experiences and adventures for our loyal and new guests, who - like Crystal - continue to seek broader horizons and new perspectives on the world. \n\"We are ecstatic to continue pioneering new areas of luxury travel,\" she added. \n\"Crystal's newly expanded fleet will truly be travellers' passport to virtually the entire world.\" \nCrystal Esprit will be delivered this November, with its December 23 maiden voyage around the Seychelles Islands followed by a New Year's Eve celebration at the Taj Dubai Hotel.

TAJ HOTELS The Crystal Esprit will spend New Year's Eve at the Taj Dubai Hotel \nMeanwhile, from 2017 Crystal River Cruises will offer Crystal Cruises' famous \"six-star service\" with designer suites, superb food and included excursions. \nAlso in 2017, Crystal Luxury Air will offer \"extravagant around-the-world trips\" in the world's most advanced twin-aisle Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
