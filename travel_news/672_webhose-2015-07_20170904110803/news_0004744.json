Better information at the booking stage about optional waiver and insurance products. More upfront information about pre- and post-rental vehicle inspection processes. Improved notification of, and dispute processes for, any charges for damage. \nThe CMA said the changes would benefit motorists hiring cars both in the UK and Europe. \n\"The improvements by these five businesses now set a benchmark for the rest of the industry to follow,\" said Nisha Arora, the CMA's senior director. \nThe consumer organisation Which? said other companies should obey the same rules. \n\"The hidden costs and sneaky practices of car hire firms have plagued airport arrival lounges for decades,\" said Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which? \n\"We now need all rental companies to be totally upfront about charges, so that people know exactly what they will pay when they book.\" \nThe CMA has produced a 60-second summary providing advice for consumers on what to look out for when renting a car.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T13:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T13:37:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
