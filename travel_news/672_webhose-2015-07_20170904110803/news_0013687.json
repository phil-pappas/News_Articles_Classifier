From the lodge, the idea of Dragonfly Helicopter Adventures was born, and in conjunction with this we started Dragonfly Travel, whose purpose was to package Cybele Forest Lodge with the nearby private game lodges in the Kruger Park. \nThe travel business expanded to incorporate itineraries throughout Southern Africa, and eventually the travel business was moved to Johannesburg. Our first big challenge was to provide the transport and logistics for Heads of State and VIP’s, during the Inauguration of President Mandela. At this time, as South Africa became a democracy, the opportunity arose to pursue corporate reward incentive travel to Southern Africa - a destination that of course had previously been shunned, due to apartheid. This incentive travel business grew very rapidly, as South Africa was seen to be one of the most exotic destinations in the world, offering sophistication, diversity and value for money. It has certainly been an amazing journey with many highlights, challenges and excitement over the years. As we reflect on our 25 years in the industry, I think that our strengths have been that we have always invested well in Sales and Marketing, we have trained and motivated our staff, and through our continuing growth we have been able to offer a way forward for career growth. We have completed some extremely complex and high number incentive programmes, and we have the expertise to tackle these large and complicated projects. We have excellent relationships with both our clients and our suppliers in Southern and Eastern Africa. ” Dragonfly Africa with their head office in Johannesburg bought Green Route in 2010, and now is also operating from this Cape Town office and the new Green Route Africa brand. The group currently employs 55 staff. Specialising in incentive travel, with the leisure division looking after individual travellers, Dragonfly Africa and Green Route Africa are well known names around the world, and are the market leaders in Incentive travel to Southern Africa in Northern America, Australia and New Zealand. Dragonfly Africa and Green Route Africa have won 11 Site Crystal Awards - the worldwide Oscars of the travel industry.
