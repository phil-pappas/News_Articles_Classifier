And where do they say you’ll get less bang for your buck? The United States.\nFor those wanting to go now, Russia offers the best value, with the Aussie dollar buying 30 per cent more roubles than 12 months ago.\nOne of the nation’s most respected economists, Colonial First State chief soothsayer Stephen Halmarick, said the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan would likely have to expand “quantitative easing” — that is, print more money. This is what monetary policy mandarins do to boost an economy when interest rates are already set to zero per cent.\nNot the right time ... While New York is a dream for millions, right now is definitely not the best time for Aussies to visit America, economists say. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nIt will have the effect of reducing the relative attractiveness of yen and euro-denominated assets such as bonds and therefore cause those currencies to drop.\n“I think both the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank will need to do more quantitative easing in the next year, further lowering interest rates and weakening their currencies,” Mr Halmarick said.\nOn the flip side, Mr Halmarick said the US was likely to start raising interest rates as soon as September, which would push up the value of the greenback, and drag with it pegged currencies such as China’s.\nJames White, who co-authored with Mr Halmarick a guide called the Travelling Economist, put Brazil at the top of his value-list. He factored in not only currency fluctuations, but buying power. This is particularly good news for those contemplating a trip to the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.\nHolidaying in nations experiencing an economic crisis is often better value for Aussies, such as Bolivia in 2002 (above). Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nThe Aussie dollar has already improved by about 15 per cent against Brazil’s currency, the real, in 2015.\nJapan was also recommended by Mr White, along with Mexico and Europe.\nCommSec chief economist Craig James said Greece would become a bargain if it ditched the euro for a new version of its old unit, the drachma.\n“More than likely, if the new drachma came into being its value would plunge,” Mr James said.\n“As a result, everyone around the world would have their holidays in Greece.\n“That would be good for Greece — they would have money coming in,” Mr James said.\nIt is as yet unclear whether Greece will bring back the drachma should it leave — or be booted — from the eurozone.\nGreat value ... Greece is looking like a great holiday destination ... provided it keeps its currency. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nFor those looking for a bargain right now, Russia appears a good option. Setting aside warzones, it is the country the Australian dollar has appreciated the most in the past 12 months, data from currency comparison site Oanda shows.\nAccording to the most recent Big Mac index by The Economist magazine, the rouble is the world’s second-most undervalued currency. India, Malaysia and Indonesia are also substantially undervalued. Switzerland was the most overvalued, followed by Norway.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/economists-point-out-the-best-overseas-holiday-destinations/story-fn6yjihw-1227428530655?sv=b89e1b608bd1e7fdccd8d70f8a048421", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/economists-point-out-the-best-overseas-holiday-destinations/story-fn6yjihw-1227428530655?sv=b89e1b608bd1e7fdccd8d70f8a048421", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/economists-point-out-the-best-overseas-holiday-destinations/story-fn6yjihw-1227428530655?sv=b89e1b608bd1e7fdccd8d70f8a048421&h=The+best+holiday+to+go+on+right+now", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=The+best+holiday+to+go+on+right+now&c=PLANNING+a+holiday%3F+If+you+want+to+get+bang+for+your+buck%2C+these+are+the+countries+you+should+be+planning+to+visit+%26%238212%3B+or+risk+paying+too+much.&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/economists-point-out-the-best-overseas-holiday-destinations/story-fn6yjihw-1227428530655?sv=b89e1b608bd1e7fdccd8d70f8a048421", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/economists-point-out-the-best-overseas-holiday-destinations/story-fn6yjihw-1227428530655?sv=b89e1b608bd1e7fdccd8d70f8a048421&title=The+best+holiday+to+go+on+right+now", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/economists-point-out-the-best-overseas-holiday-destinations/story-fn6yjihw-1227428530655?sv=b89e1b608bd1e7fdccd8d70f8a048421&title=The+best+holiday+to+go+on+right+now"], "published": "2015-07-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T17:32:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
