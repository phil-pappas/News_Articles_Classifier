I stayed with a friend who has lived there for two years. \nDon’t miss: The Museum of Innocence, an artful recreation of upper-class Turkish life from the 1970s to 2000s, created by Turkish Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk. Ferry rides on the waterways were breathtaking. \nDon’t bother: Worrying about language or getting around — the Turkish people are very kind and helpful. \nCoolest souvenir: A Turkish charm to ward off evil spirits. No religious connotation for the charm — Muslims, Jews and Christians can be seen wearing it. \nWorth a splurge: A Turkish bath at Ayasofya Hurrem Sultan Bath in Sultanahmet. Established in 1556, an exotic, relaxing way to experience Turkish culture. \nWish I’d packed: More time. So much to see inside and outside of Istanbul. And an extra pair of shoes — walked 150 miles while there. \nOther comments: I was in Istanbul for three weeks and it was magical. I took public transportation so was able to see Turkish culture from a different perspective.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T07:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T17:23:36.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
