I shall explain the significance, I said. Hold your horses.\nI don’t know how I’d never managed to visit Italy’s Amalfi Coast before, when I tell myself I have been everywhere.\nTerrace by the sea: The Palazzo Avino’s beach club has the perfect spot for gazing into the distance\nIt’s just a two-and-a-bit-hour flight to Naples, then an hour’s drive up the coast.\nWhen John Steinbeck went there in 1953, he said it was one of the ‘most beautiful and dramatic coastlines in the world’.\nBut he was rather mocking about the main road, saying it had 1,000 bends and was ‘carefully designed to be a little bit narrower than two cars side by side’.\nThe pearl of the coast, the total toff lording it over hoi polloi down on the coast itself, is the little town of Ravello, perched some 1,000ft up on a series of terraces.\n Next Forget thinking you have to fly abroad: Here are Britain's... Grade I listed mansion that once hosted famous In and Out... Perfect postcards from the land of enchantment: Beautiful... You won't want to land! New Zealand's Queenstown Airport... So much has been written about it, so many famous people have visited the town, that it is hard to realise, gazing at all the wonders, that the population is only 2,500.\nYet it has four five-star hotels, an international music festival, and two of Italy’s best gardens.\nThe heart of Ravello is like a film set, all cool cobbles and secret lanes leading to hidden gardens and sudden little squares.\nA view unsurpassed: Looking out from a room at the Palazzo Avino. The tasteful hotel dates back to the 12th Century\nDown on the coast at Amalfi, the hordes belt around, but in the four days I was in Ravello, the place seemed empty.\nMy hotel, the Palazzo Avino, like many of the buildings, dates from the 12th Century, and is so discreet and tasteful you can easily miss it.\nThe main entrance is a small door in a wall, but once you enter, it is as if the light has come on, and the stars and the sun and the heavens have all opened up for you, for below, laid out, is the whole of the Bay of Naples.\nI honestly don’t think I have been in a hotel with a better view.\nThe restaurant has a Michelin star, but what attracts me is a hotel that is small and not part of a chain.\nPalazzo Avino has 43 rooms, a perfect number, and is privately owned by a local family. That’s the sort of hotel that gets my stars.\nThe 90 staff are also attentive and thoughtful, which is not often the case with Italian hotels. The interior is filled with antiques, paintings, marble, mosaic- tiled floors and white walls.\nNo room is the same as another, because it was not built as a hotel, but as a palazzo for a grand family to live in.\nThe famous tinned tomatoes given by Davies' hotel owner in honour of her father\nMy only problem was all the steps and terraces, as I do have a poor knee, but I was so excited and stimulated that I managed to explore most things – though I did not walk from the hotel down to the sea.\nSeveral young and foolish guests, American honeymooners, walked the 1,600 steps to the shore, then came back up – they must have been potty.\nFortunately the hotel has its own beach club, just 15 minutes away in the hotel shuttle bus, exclusively for guests.\nThe facilities and food there are almost as fine as that at the hotel itself. The sea was surprisingly warm for early May – but there is no beach.\nInstead there are a number of sunbathing terraces on rocks, and you climb down some steps to take a dip in the sea.\nI suppose that it is the one drawback of the Amalfi Coast. The beaches, where they exist, are rubbish.\nThe town of Amalfi does have a beach, but it’s all pebbles and dark grit. Then again, Brighton beach is crummy, but that has never put off the punters.\nOne of the joys of wandering silently around Ravello is coming across little plaques and mementoes high up on walls, telling you who once was there.\nI turned left out of the front door and, on a wall of what was once the bishop’s house, found a plaque to Andre Gide and Edward M. Forster. I wondered who the latter was, then realised it was E. M. Forster.\nMy second wonder was: ‘Goodness, did they stay together. Was it a holiday romance?’ Then I checked the dates – 1902 for Gide and 1925 for Forster.\nEach did work on books while staying here – Gide on The Immoralist, and Forster on The Story Of A Panic.\nNearby is a cobbled, terraced lane, leading down to the Duomo square, which is named after Richard Wagner – a bit of a liberty as he visited Ravello for only five or six hours in 1880, but he was so struck by the gardens that he used them as the setting for a scene in his opera Parsifal.\nThis connection has led to operas and classical concerts being given in Ravello to this day.\nStar appeal: Hollywood screen actress Gina Lollobrigida made several films in Ravello\nD. H. Lawrence was another visitor, and worked on Lady Chatterley’s Lover while he was here. Virginia Woolf and the Bloomsbury Set used to come every year.\nOther literary visitors ranged from Henry Longfellow to Graham Greene. Many stayed for months, escaping to work on a book, and some had their own villa, such as Gore Vidal.\nThere are also lots of film connections, with several starring Gina Lollobrigida shot in Ravello.\nIn the main square there is a plaque with photos of Humphrey Bogart, John Huston, Lollobrigida and Truman Capote working on the 1953 film Beat The Devil. Greta Garbo and Leopold Stokowski, having an affair, supposedly, also stayed in Ravello.\nThe more modern celebs don’t seem to have visited, or at least they’ve kept it quiet. The nearest to a present-day superstar is Gary Lineker, who had his wedding in Ravello in 2009.\nThe boss of my hotel turned out to be just as classy and attractive as the place itself. Mariella Avino, 30, went to university in Milan and then ‘hotel school’ in Switzerland.\nShe is due to get married to her boyfriend of nine years but, she says, the hotel has been like having a husband – she has lavished her love on it, caring for every corner, every colour.\nPalazzo Avino was bought by her father in 1995. He is one of Italy’s leading producers of tinned tomatoes.\nThat is why – yes, we have got there at last – that Mariella gives every guest a handsomely decorated, commemorative tin of his special plum tomatoes. Not a tin you can buy in the shops, just one for guests, in honour of her father.\nI managed to get four – one each for my wife and three children. Wasn’t I kind?\nTRAVEL FACTS: Plan your own Italian adventure British Airways ( ba.com ) offers return flights from Gatwick to Naples from £83.\nThe Palazzo Avino ( palazzoavino.com ) offers rooms from about £195 per night.\nRead more: Book Flights, Holidays & Check In Online | British Airways Welcome | Palazzo Avino", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1MhX2Au", "http://www.palazzoavino.com/", "http://ba.com/"], "published": "2015-07-19T07:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T03:17:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
