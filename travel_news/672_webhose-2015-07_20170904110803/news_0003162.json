In fact, by 23 I’d had not one but two babies.\nEven in 2015 there is still a resounding double standard when it comes to the announcement of pregnancies.\nEvery time someone over 40 announces a pregnancy the world cheers them on.\n“Power to you, parenthood at any age is beautiful.”\n“You will make such a good parent, you have so much life experience and knowledge now.”\n“What a great time to have a baby, you have you’re finances in order and can settle into parenthood and spend time with the child.”\nBut as soon as anyone under 25 announces a pregnancy, the world collective loses its mind.\n“But you haven’t lived.”\n“You have RUINED your life.”\n“How will you juggle your career AND a baby, that is an impossible task.”\nWell I call bulls**t.\nLisa Almond is calling bulls**t on Louis Tomlinson not being old enough to be a dad. Photo: Getty Images Source: Getty Images\nObviously for Louis, finances won’t be an issue but regardless of this he is still well equipped — and old enough — to be a father.\nDespite what may or may not be socially acceptable, 23 is a great age to have a baby, and for anyone doubting the fact, yes you can have a life and a baby simultaneously. And that includes those that aren’t celebrities.\nIf anything, falling pregnant young allowed me to chase my dreams with more dedication and drive than I ever thought possible. I wasn’t just doing it for myself, I was doing it for my children as well.\nWhat I don’t understand is why is it is completely acceptable to berate young parents while the same people cheer on older parents and congratulate them on their decision to wait.\nBecoming a parent at a young age definitely hasn’t hindered the careers of Reese Witherspoon, Sofia Vergara or Kate Hudson, or male celebrities like LeBron James and David Beckham, who both welcomed their first children into the world in their early 20s.\nNot that long ago, your early 20s was a stock-standard time to start a family, but now a stigma around becoming a parent at this age has grown.\nThe age is now known as a time to ‘find yourself’ whether it is climbing the corporate ladder or ‘building life experience’ with endless overseas backpacking adventures.\nWhether pregnancies are planned or not, the fact is, young parents are just as capable at giving their children as much love and support as older parents, and having a child young sure as hell isn’t a reason to stop striving to achieve your goals, personal and professional.\nAs a young parent myself, I was pleased to read that Louis is reportedly “happy and excited” that his life is headed in a New Direction.\nCongratulations to them both.\nCongratulations to them both.
