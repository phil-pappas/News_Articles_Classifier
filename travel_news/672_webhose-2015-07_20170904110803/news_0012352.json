Well, it's now OK to pull out your cellphone or camera and press \"shoot.\" \nThe White House on Wednesday ended a long-standing ban on tourists taking photos or using social media during public tours of the building. \nFirst Lady Michelle Obama made the announcement in a video posted on her Instagram account. 0 \n\"If you've been on a White House tour, you may have seen this sign,\" she says holding up a placard that states \"No Photos or Social Media Allowed.\" ''Well, not anymore,\" she adds, and then dramatically rips the sign in half. \nThe White House said the more than 40-year-old ban was lifted because changes in camera technology make it possible to take high-quality photos using less light. Strong light can damage the delicate pigments used in art work. \nTourists arriving Wednesday were busily taking pictures. \n\"I'm very happy they changed the rule. I'm taking as many as I can,\" said Michael Labrecque, who came to tour the White House from Florida with his wife and their two sons. \nStill on the banned list are video cameras, including action camcorders, cameras with detachable lenses, tablets, tripods, monopods and camera sticks. Flash photography and live-streaming also remain prohibited. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
