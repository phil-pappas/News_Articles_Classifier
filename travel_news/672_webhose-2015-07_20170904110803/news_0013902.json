A number of the largest forces in the country are recording rising numbers of offences against Jewish people and property, figures from police forces show. In London and Greater Manchester the total more than doubled in a year, while there were also increases in Merseyside, West Midlands and West Yorkshire. Crimes included assault, harassment, arson and criminal damage. Figures supplied by the Metropolitan Police under Freedom of Information laws showed the force recorded a total of 193 anti-semitic crimes in 2013/14. The number jumped by 137 per cent in 2014/15 to 459. Of the total offences in the most recent financial year, 53 - more than one in ten - involved violence. There were 276 incidents of harassment, while criminal damage accounted for 115 anti-semitic crimes. A similar pattern was also seen in Greater Manchester, where there is also a large Jewish community. • Sarah's Law is 'not working', NSPCC warn The force said there were a total of 172 anti-semitic offences in 2014/15 - more than double the 82 recorded in the previous year. Over the two years, there were 21 cases of religiously aggravated common assault. Rising numbers of offences were not observed across all forces. Several recorded small numbers of offences in both years, with the figures showing a minor rise or fall, or in some cases, remaining steady. Communities Minister Baroness Williams said: \"Anti-semitism and hate crimes of any sort are not only vile, wrong and totally unacceptable in our society, but they are also an affront to the British values that we hold dear. \"Whilst one antisemitic incident is one too many, it is positive that members of the Jewish community now feel more able to speak out against these pernicious crimes knowing that their government will hear their voice and act decisively to protect them.\" The findings come at a time of heightened alert among Jewish communities after terrorist attacks in Europe. A Kosher supermarket was targeted in the Paris atrocities in January and the following month a Jewish man was killed near the main synagogue in Copenhagen.

She said: \"Those who seek to spread anti-semitic hatred should know that the Government will act against all those who seek to divide our country and sow discord.\" Police figures revealed a substantial rise in the number of incidents reported in London, where a large proportion of Britain's Jews live. @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T22:43:22.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
