Make reservations and ask for pet-only, non-smoking rooms. Also, request a ground-floor room for late-night potty runs. \n2. Travel on an empty stomach to avoid car sickness. If the trip is long, feed a smaller amount than normal at least two hours before you leave. \n3. Make sure your pet stays hydrated. Carry a portable water filter, boil water from home and store it in air-tight bottles or use commercial bottled water. \n4. Leave the front seat for humans. If an airbag deploys while your pet is in the passenger seat (even in a crate), it might injure your pet. \n5. Take your walks in the morning or evening. Midday heat can overwhelm your dog. \n6. Be sure to take plenty of your dog's regular food. Changing his diet can cause an upset stomach. \n7. If you have to leave your dog alone in your hotel room, make sure to place a note on your door for housekeeping. \n8. Always be sure your dog's ID tag includes your cell phone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T02:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T03:21:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
