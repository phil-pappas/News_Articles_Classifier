We’re proud to support Australia’s incredible stable of producers, bringing them to the attention of industry heavyweights and the Australian public,” said Delicious editor-in-chief Kerrie McCallum.\nThe Delicious awards continue to champion the best Australian produce and the people behind it, thanks to readers who nominate their local ‘produce’ heroes.
