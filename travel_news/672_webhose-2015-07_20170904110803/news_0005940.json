Wherever she went, Floriane found similar scenes of solitude behind the bright city lights.\nFloriane began the project in 2004, while she was studying photography at the School of the International Centre of Photography.\nFloriane De Lassee's ongoing photography project, Inside Views, shows the loneliness of life in some of the world's busiest cities. Pictured: Paris\nThe French photographer explains that she believes people can feel much more alone in big cities such as New York, than people would in small villages. She says as a newcomer to the city she often found herself feeling alone.\n'I was living alone in the Lower East Side, on the fourth level and would see interesting things happening in the windows facing my apartment. Often I could see lonely women waiting for someone or something to happen.\n Is this the luckiest couple on earth (or are they just very... British holidaymakers take legal action after coach crash in... The breathtaking beauty of Britain: Spectacular photos show... 'So I started to stage myself lost at the window in various situations and apartments around me.'\nFloriane began to watch the different scenes of everyday life she could see from her New York apartment window, and found herself particularly drawn to photographing at night.\nFloriane's favourite shot is from Istanbul, where a woman lies awake in her flat in front of the stunning Agia Sophia Mosque\nThe project includes many of the world's major metropolises, as solitude is present behind the stark lights of the city almost everywhere\nIn New York City, a lone woman walks across her rooftop in the middle of the night wearing what appears to be a bathrobe\nThe French photographer captured a woman airing out her carpet in the middle of the night from her balcony in Balat, Istanbul\nIt was at night she would spot the lone souls who remain awake, restless in the midst of the night when everyone else would appear to be asleep.\nShe then moved to Paris where she continued the series, she has since travelled around the world to Tokyo, Shanghai, Istanbul, Moscow, Las Vegas, Beijing, Sao Paulo, Macao and Mumbai.\nThe talented photographer explains that she could feel the same solitude in every city she visited.\nHer aim, however was not to capture a particular city. Instead, Floriane tried to find the common traits and emotions that the cities' inhabitants share.\nIn Beijing, a woman is pictured against several large glass windows while the city lights blaze brightly behind her\nThe French photographer explains that she believes people can feel much more alone in big cities such as New York or Tokyo (pictured), than people would in small villages\nThe project first started when Floriane was living in New York's Lower East Side and she would watch the scenes of everyday life that she could see from her window\nFrom her New York vantage point, she found herself particularly drawn to photographing scenes at night\nIt was at night Floraine would spot the lone souls who remain awake, restless in the midst of the night when everyone else would appear to be asleep\nWhen the photographer moved to Paris, she continued her series, eventually photographing people from all over the world\nWherever she visited, Floriane would wait by her window or balcony, watching how the cities change as night falls.\nThe photographer decided she wanted to capture the loneliness and insomnia she had seen in every city.\nFloriane chose to use models and sometimes herself, to re-create scenes she had witnessed, and to also create new images she felt reflected solitude she saw in each city.\nUsing models ensured that Floriane could capture each image without the risk of someone closing their curtain, and also meant she was not infringing on others privacy.\n'My favourite image from the series was taken in Istanbul. I went on three trips to Istanbul to get this shot.\n'It is naturally composed like this, the mosque Agia Sophia/Sainte Sophie is in the background and in the foreground a hotel room where you can be naked.\n'The natural contrast between nudity and religion seems interesting to me, moreover in a city like Istanbul, a melting pot or Eastern and Western cultures. So I staged myself over here in 2006, 2010 and 2011 to get the perfect shot.'\nFloriane uses models and sometimes herself, to re-create scenes she had witnessed, and to also create new images she felt reflected the solitude she saw in each city\nUsing models ensured that Floriane could capture each image without the risk of someone closing their curtain, and also meant she was not infringing on others privacy\nA woman sits on her couch, looking longingly out the window of her apartment in Paris, with the Sacre Coeur in the distance\nIn Namibia, several women are pictured outside of a Shoprite in what appears to be the middle of the night\nIn Mumbai, a woman looks out onto the city from a large terrace, lit up by the bright lights of the metropolis\nIn Beijing, a foggy cityscape engulfs a building in which two women are sitting in the middle of the night\nIn Las Vegas, Floriane recreated a scene of loneliness, incorporating nudity, which she believes to be a natural contrast to the city\nFloriane has been photographing the cities of insomnia for at least 10 years and had a book published filled with the pictures in 2008\nThe photographer explains in her project statement, that in the high insomnia megalopolis, splashed by stunning lights like so many islands of solitude, a heart beats, fragile, human.\n'No matter whether it's Paris or Istanbul. I do not photograph cities, but an imaginary City that inhabits each megalopolis. It is the product of the Man's excesses, his genius, his madness. The City exceeds the overflow. She is about to devour us.'\nFloriane explains that her images are natural diptych shots with a large format camera, and not a digital photo montage.\nFloriane has been photographing the cities of insomnia for at least ten years, and she had a book published filled with pictures of the cities that never sleep in 2008.", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1Hz6hs0"], "published": "2015-07-18T00:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T19:09:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
