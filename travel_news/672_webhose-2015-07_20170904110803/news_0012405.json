The new lounge is in fact the seventh at Sea-Tac, but unique in that it’s offered by a credit card company and not by an airline or by the airport itself. Four of the lounges within Sea-Tac are operated by airlines: United, British Airways , Delta and Alaska. Reflecting the battle for passengers between the latter two, Delta’s 8,000-square-foot lounge, built on the roof of the South Satellite in 2012, is the largest at Sea-Tac, said port spokesman Perry Cooper . The Atlanta carrier opened it as an expansion from its earlier 6,800-square-foot facility, as it also expanded its flights into Sea-Tac. But competitor Alaska also is expanding its lounge footprint, and currently operates two: one on Concourse B, and a temporary lounge in the North Satellite. Alaska plans a larger lounge there, Cooper said. The port also operates two lounges of its own, called the Club at SEA, which enable international carriers to provide lounge facilities. The larger meaning of the seventh lounge, Centurion Studio, is competition, Danishek said., “A lot of business travelers are very competitive people, and they like one-upping each other,” he said. “That’s where the competition is now, to get the big spenders on your airline, or using their card.” \nWant Seattle Travel news in your inbox?
