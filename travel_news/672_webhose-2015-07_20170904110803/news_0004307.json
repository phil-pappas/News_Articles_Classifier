ALBANS, Vt. - Dreams can come true. A 17-year-old diagnosed with cancer gets a big surprise from Make-A-Wish.\nThe Vermont chapter of the charity granted the St. Albans teen's wish Wednesday. But they caught him off guard. He didn't think he would get his wish for another month.\nDevin Aylward, 17, loves cars, anything from BMWs to Ferraris to Porsches.\nThe St. Albans teen was diagnosed with leukemia last summer. His family got in touch with the Vermont chapter of the charity Make-A-Wish, a foundation granting wishes for kids with life-threatening illnesses. He originally asked to meet a celebrity.\n\"Kevin Durant has a three year waiting list. During the process when we were waiting and trying to feel things out, Devin's parents had told them they were going to buy him a car. Devin said I wonder if Make-A-Wish would trick my car out for me,\" said Joe Larose, wish granter.\nDevin's parents bought him a used BMW and Make-A-Wish sent it to the RPM auto shop for a major makeover, but kept the details under wraps. When the teen showed up at what he thought was a Make-A-Wish barbecue Wednesday he was in for a big surprise.\nA week of work and $15,000 later, the tricked-out ride was ready.\n\"They put a lot of stuff on it. They put a front bumper on new seats, new calibers, new rims,\" said Devin.\nAnd even more exciting than a BMW is that following a bone marrow transplant doctors tell Devin his cancer is in remission.\nDevin's sister Mariah donated her stem cells to help him recover.\nReporter Logan Crawford: Was that painful?\nMariah: It was yea, I was put under for it. Afterward it was pretty painful.\nCrawford: So you guys were a match, same blood type?\nMariah: Yea, same match same blood type and everything.\n\"There was definitely hard times but I think it was easier for me just because I knew I was saving his life,\" said Mariah.\nDevin says he's thankful for his sister's help in fighting his leukemia and to Make-A-Wish for making his time in remission a whole lot more fun.\n\"Grateful for what they do. It helps you, kind of keeps your mind off things. 'Cause going through this you just think about a lot of stuff. It's pretty cool,\" said Devin.\nAnd he wasted no time getting behind the wheel.\n\"Love it for sure. Killin it,\" said Devin\nMake-A-Wish Vermont started in 1989 and has granted wishes to more than 600 Vermont kids. The charity estimates they will grant 40 wishes to kids this year across the state.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T10:14:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
