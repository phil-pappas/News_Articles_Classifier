Mahan Terry Slaybaugh, director of aviation for the city-owned Dayton International Airport. Terry Slaybaugh hasn’t missed a beat since returning as director of the city-owned Dayton International Airport in May. Slaybaugh — who left for about 90 days to run the General Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee — is pushing ahead with a long list of upgrade projects that were in the works here before his departure. That’s a big part of the reason he was excited to come back. Late last week I sat down with Slaybaugh, who opened up to me about leaving Dayton and the opportunity to get his old job back. Q: Did going away give you more of an appreciation for Dayton? A: Before I left, people here did a lot to try to keep me. So I knew I was leaving a good situation to go up there, to go to a bigger airport. I think the perspective I got from being in Milwaukee is just how much easier it is to get things done (in Dayton). We have a city commission and mayor, good leadership, that’s on the same page. You don’t have a lot of infighting. Up there, they had a board of supervisors that are at each others throats. It was a completely different political environment. Q: How tough was the decision to leave and come back, both personally and professionally? A : It was hard, but it was the right thing for me to do for my family. Also, the situation up there wasn’t a good environment for me. I didn’t have a lot of autonomy. I was being pretty heavily managed by my boss. I’ll be curious to see how they fill that job because I think they’re going to have a hard time getting a professional airport director who is seasoned. They really had a lot of ideas about what they wanted that I just don’t think fit our business. Q: What advice would you give to other executives in similar situations — those who took a new job that didn’t work out and have a chance to come back? A: A lot of them can’t come back. I kind of beat the odds. Think about it, how many opportunities would you get to go back into your old job? Usually when you part that way, they’re really not excited about getting you back. So I felt fortunate. I guess the biggest advice to give people is ... the “not burn any bridges” adage was really true for me. (After I left here) I was still talking with the city manager, still texting the mayor. I was keeping in close contact with people here. So it wasn’t awkward for me to ask, when the time came, if I could come back. \nWant Dayton Logistics & Transportation   Related Content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T22:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T23:53:15.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
