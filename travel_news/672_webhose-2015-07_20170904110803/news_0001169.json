Kids also contributed to unhappy marriages.\nThe report’s author, Associate Professor Roger Wilkins, said that could be because children were often the source of tension in relationships.\n“(It’s about) you know, who’s going to do the child care and so forth,” he told ABC radio today.\nThose in de facto relationships are more happy with their partners than married couples because they’re less likely to have children.\nThe survey also found women who were more adventurous and open to experiences decreased men’s satisfaction.\nAnd the longer you’re in a relationship, the unhappier you are. However, while men may have certain preferences for their ideal partner, they’re generally more satisfied with their partners than women are.\nThe survey also provides a revealing snapshot of what makes most couples tick.\nIf you don’t smoke but your partner does, you’re more likely to be unhappy in your relationship, but differences in drinking behaviour don’t matter as much.\nFinancial struggles also contributed to poor relationships.\nOriginally published as How to keep a man happy", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/relationships/how-to-keep-a-man-happy-new-research-suggest-women-shouldnt-get-a-job-or-have-kids/story-fnet09y4-1227442917125"], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T10:29:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
