As part of the initiative, Macdonald Hotels & Resorts is organising a series of nine weekend events across the group’s regions to showcase the outstanding and unique offering available, while injecting a sense of fun and learning into the agent familiarisation process. \nAll agents who sign up to the scheme are given a passport and encouraged to collect a stamp from each trip they attend. As a further incentive, everyone who takes part in the initiative and collects one or more stamp could win a trip to a Macdonald Hotel & Resort in the UK or abroad. The latest event took place at the hotel groups’ North West hotels including Macdonald Craxton Wood Hotel & Spa, Macdonald New Blossoms Hotel, Macdonald Kilhey Court and Macdonald Tickled Trout Hotel. The two-night trip saw agents take part in a cocktail making masterclass, making use of each hotel’s leisure facilities and being given tours of each hotel and the local area. Agents got chance to see the new facilities at Macdonald Kilhey Court following a recent refurbishment as well as having a sneak peek at the newly launched spa at Macdonald Craxton Wood Hotel & Spa, before finishing the trip off at Blackpool Pleasure Beach with VIP wristbands. Gill Jackson, Sales Director at Macdonald Hotels & Resorts, said: “Engaging agents with unique and educational familiarisation trips is very important for us. We have a varied portfolio of beautiful hotels, offering a wide variety of meetings options. These trips give a genuine feel for each hotel and allow the agents to understand the offering first-hand. “Our recently launched Macdonald Meetings product clarifies the promises we make to ensure booking an event with us is a quick and easy process. We make time for business in many ways and our structured, year-long programme of destination led familiarisation trips is the first step in educating booking agents on our product through first-hand experience.” The next visit will take place in Aviemore in September, with the last visit being completed in Southampton during June 2015. Gill continues “The first two events have received very positive feedback from agents and we’re looking forward to delivering the rest of the programme between now and June next year. We’ve made sure that each itinerary encourages lots of fun and learning and would encourage anyone interested to sign up and find out more about the scheme.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T18:20:16.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
