According to ADP, construction firms added 19,000 jobs last month, while retail, shipping and utility companies gained 50,000.\nToday, the government is scheduled to issue its official jobs report for June. Economists forecast it will show that employers added 233,000 jobs and the unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent from 5.5 percent.\nThe ADP survey covers only private businesses, however, and frequently diverges from the official figures. In May, the government said employers created 280,000 new jobs, much more than the ADP estimate.\nSmall companies with fewer than 50 employees accounted for half the total job gains, ADP said, adding 120,000 jobs. Midsize businesses with 50 to 499 workers gained 86,000, and large companies hired only 32,000 new workers.\nManufacturers added 7,000 jobs, their first increase since February. That suggests factories are recovering from headwinds like the strong dollar, which has risen about 15 percent in value against overseas currencies the past year. That increase makes U.S. goods more expensive overseas, cutting into exports.\nThe ADP report reinforces other recent data that show the economy on an upswing. The number of Americans signing contracts to buy homes rose to a nine-year high in May.\nAnd permits to build new homes jumped 11.8 percent in May to the highest level since August 2007.\nConsumers are more confident and spending more. A measure of confidence rose more than 17 percent the past year.", "external_links": ["http://northjersey.mycapture.com/mycapture/lookup.asp?originalname=MC_070215_B_OfficeShares_kc65.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-02T09:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T14:10:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
