At 1.40pm today, the Matterhorn-shaped laser display board outside Zermatt station will complete its countdown, 150 years to the minute since Edward Whymper and Michel Croz ran up the last slope of the last unscaled Alp in a head-to-head race that ended in a dead heat. What about the calamity that came two hours later, when the Matterhorn, in Whymper’s words, “took terrible vengeance”? It was the accident, more than the ascent, that put Zermatt on the front page and made its fortune. Will the town bow its head in silence, remembering Hadow, Croz, Hudson and Douglas? Probably not. One small slip for mankind cost a Frenchman and three British Victorians their lives that day, but Zermatt has lost many of its own and needs no lectures about paying its respects. The mountain gives and it takes away. Gustav Dore's famous illustration of 1865, drawn after four men died on the descent from the summit Photo: Alamy The Matterhorn is not the highest peak in the Swiss Alps, nor even in this valley. But it stands alone, a piece of singular sculptural beauty fashioned with a raffish twist at the top, which transforms geometry into art and a scramble into a climb. Stripped by glaciers to its rocky core, the Matterhorn is the essence of mountain-hood, designed to thrill and kill. It also has the added romance of its history and if we pay the supplement for a Matterhorn view we can admire its perfection with a gin and tonic on the balcony, indulging our landscape appreciation until darkness intervenes. Edward Whymper's own sketch of the Matterhorn Photo: Alamy A pretty view, but the Matterhorn is also a challenge. Should I try to climb the thing? Whymper has a stern warning about this. “Many persons get upon it who ought not to be upon a mountain at all,” he writes; and further, “we are not all constituted alike”. For those of us who draw the line at climbing a ladder to prune the roses, yet enjoy a mountain walk, Zermatt has mapped out a Matterhorn Tour for hikers. This is a serious 10-day undertaking via many high passes between the Swiss and Italian valleys and I studied it, striking out sections that mention chains, nights to be spent in mountain refuges at an altitude where I know I won’t sleep, and the slopes between Zermatt and Cervinia cluttered with ski lifts and pistes. By this method I selected a section of the tour starting at Gruben in the Turtmann valley to the west of Zermatt. A day’s walk over the mountain via the Augstbord Pass (2,894m) will bring me down to the main villagein the area, St Niklaus, and from there I will proceed to Zermatt by the high road, the low road or the train. The Turtmanntal is marvellously undeveloped. “Why have you come here?” asks the taxi driver, as we swing through the first of many hairpins. “Gruben is small. There is nothing.” I’m going to walk to Zermatt, I reply. “At your age? Who with?” Not with anyone. I have a book to read when not walking, and the beautiful Swiss Alpine scenery to enjoy. No doubt there will be other hikers for me to talk to if I lose my way or feel the need for intercourse. The peak of the Matterhorn rises in isolation above Zermatt Photo: Alamy An unaccompanied walk might not be everyone’s dream holiday, but it sounds good to me. The weather is fair and we are not all constituted alike. The hotel Schwarzhorn at Gruben is easy to find, a big grey building in a hamlet of small wooden chalets; midway between hotel and refuge in character, with communal ablutions. Boots and socks line the corridor, and fumes emanating from them suggest that the hikers in the Schwarzhorn have been on the hoof for some time. In the dining room much technical clothing is on show, and a reassuring amount of grey hair. Conversation is lively: “What does your pack weigh? Mine’s 30lbs without camping stuff,” and more of the same. Mostly Americans and Brits, from the sound of it, walking from Chamonix to Zermatt on the summer version of the Haute Route, about half of which coincides with the Matterhorn Tour. Breakfast starts at 6.30am, which is early for a hotel but late for a refuge. Boots are laced and packs shouldered by 8am and the pulse quickens on the steep grassy slope behind the hotel. “When a man gets upon the side of a mountain, he speedily finds out that walking is an art, procures an alpenstock and turns himself into a tripod,” says Whymper. I have followed this advice and am glad of my ski stick, although most of my fellow walkers have turned themselves into quad-pods and on bits of slippery descent I envy them. By 9.15am I have left steep forest behind and entered a zone of sunshine and pasture: a slow movement in the symphony before the going gets rocky and steeper again for the zigzag approach to the pass. The view from the top (11am) is tremendous – glaciers glimpsed through gaps in pillowy fine-weather cloud – but it’s too cold to hang around. The descent starts easily but soon requires concentration: eyes down for an hour of rock-hopping across a landslide which looks new but may not be. The path narrows – don’t look down – before a belvedere where all pause for pictures against a backdrop of 4,000-metre peaks (not including the Matterhorn). “I was NOT comfortable there,” says a hiker from Wisconsin. Nor I. The grassy walk down to Jungu is pure pleasure, with wildflowers, butterflies and the music of cowbells welcoming us back to civilisation. Jungu’s perch includes a couple of farms, a richly decorated chapel and a simple restaurant with a grand view of Switzerland’s highest mountains (still no Matterhorn). I could walk down to St Niklaus in an hour, but where is the virtue or pleasure in walking down a steep mule track, when Jungu’s telecabine is offering? I share it with an Australian who started his walk in Chamonix. How are you finding it? “Good. Plenty of hikers to hook up with. Not many single women, though.” And the highlight of the trip so far? “Today, definitely.” My day ends at St Niklaus, but the Australian has more walking to do, up the other side of the valley and on. Is this where the 19-year-old J R R Tolkien, en route from Grindelwald to Zermatt in 1911, narrowly escaped death by landslide, as later fictionalised in Frodo’s quest, with the Lauterbrunnen valley recast as Rivendell and the Matterhorn as Mount Doom? I have read that this section of the route is impassable somewhere – more landslides – and this is my excuse for taking the low road along the valley floor. It may be a cop-out, but I can suit myself and the 20km walk is a delight: along the river, passing quiet hamlets along the way. There are glaciers and waterfalls, and raw places where the mountain has been skinned to the bone by avalanches and rock slides. The Matterhorn remains hidden until the end, popping out moments before I hit the wall of sound at Zermatt’s heliport. Expensive joyrides pay for mountain rescue missions. At Zermatt I swap guides, abandoning Mr Whymper for the more congenial Mark Twain who arrived in 1878 to find the village in the grip of mountaineering fever. All the stirring accounts of high alpine derring-do prompted Twain to compose a parody. Chapters 37 to 39 of his A Tramp Abroad, is a brilliant read about ascending the Riffelberg and companion piece to Whymper, and if it inspires you, as it did me, to walk to Riffelberg via the Trift gorge and Glacier Garden, you will be in for a spectacular half day excursion, with a good hotel and a famous Matterhorn view at the end of it. Watch out for mountain bikers, though, bouncing down the steep path at speed, blind corners notwithstanding. The ascent of the Riffelberg passes Blatten, one of Zermatt’s many excellent mountain restaurants, beautifully set in a meadow beneath the Matterhorn. Its owner is Leander Taugwalder, whose name has resonance. “Yes, I’m descended from the guides on the first ascent,” he admits cheerfully. It was all a long time ago, too many generations to count. Old Peter Taugwalder retired to a place lower down the valley where he would never have to see the accursed Matterhorn again. His descendant has no such trouble in mind. Instead of the evil spirits feared by his ancestors he met a pretty girl on the summit, moved in tight for the camera and married her soon afterwards. I am hoping he might shed new light on the events of 150 years ago, in defence of the family name. What about the story that it was Whymper who cut the rope, on the way up, leaving Old Taugwalder with nothing but a flimsy reserve cord to use? New Taugwalder will not be drawn on this subject, but prefers to talk about his uncle Alex, one of the all-time greats. “People say the Matterhorn is easy, but it isn’t,” he tells me. “I have been on nearly all the Swiss peaks and it’s one of the most difficult. It never lets up, you need strong arms and the exposure is really something – 2,000m of air. Those were tough guys. They had no Vibram soles, no fixed ropes, and their wet gloves froze solid. Can you imagine?” Yes and no. He pulls out an album of photographs from his most recent ascent, in 2009. “Conditions were perfect. Have you been up? You look fit. You should do it.” What, at my age? Thanks, Taugwalder, but I’m not falling for that one. Walking the trail For more information about the Matterhorn Tour hiking trail (150km/9 days), see tourducervin.ch.
