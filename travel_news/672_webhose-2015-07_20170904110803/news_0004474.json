Related Content United flights resume after computer problem \nLast night the airline sent a memo last night obtained by CNN warning employees that that there could be \"lingering issues\" as it worked to get all the systems back to full working order. It said, \"employees may encounter some problems with a few systems.\" \nThe airline did not immediately respond to request for comment from CNN. \nConnectivity problems with its computer system grounded all United flights for more than an hour Wednesday morning, and caused travel problems for passengers whose flights were delayed and canceled as well as for those who missed connections. \nAccording to flight tracker FlightStats, United canceled 39 flights and had nearly 1,500 delays on Wednesday, roughly twice as much as the day before. The airline said that it is experiencing some delays today but that they are \"mostly\" due to weather. \nShares of United Continental, which owns United, traded higher Thursday after losing nearly 3% Wednesday. \nCorrection: An earlier version of this story said that United was still experiencing problems and that it had canceled flights Thursday morning due to system problems. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
