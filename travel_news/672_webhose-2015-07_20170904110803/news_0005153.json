Indians and Chinese account for about 30 per cent of Nepal's tourists. \nTourism is a key source of foreign currency for Nepal, which has many of the world's highest mountains, including Mount Everest. \nOne popular trekking route was damaged by the earthquake but the others were unaffected.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T00:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T04:15:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
