They burned off the hole, hoping that the fire would use all of the fuel that leaked and inevitably burn out, but it has continued burning to this day. \nSome of the most fascinating natural landscapes around the world are actually the result of human activity. \nMining has led to the accidental creation of stunning geysers in destinations like Nevada and Madagascar and the building of dams has led to lakes in unexpected places like the Egyptian desert and in the remote corners of the United Arab Emirates. \nFrom the Door to Hell, whose continuous burning is actually the result of Soviet geologists who accidentally drilled and tried to burn off fuels in the hole, to Providence Canyon, which was formed through poor farming practices in the 1800s, here are 9 natural landmarks that are actually man-made. \nFLY GEYSER IN NEVADA \nNevada's Fly Geyser, located in Washoe County, was created through accidental well drilling in 1916. In the 1960s, the water began escaping from the drilled location, creating the geyser which is known for its stunning changing colours. \nPhoto: Daily Mail \nLAKE ZAHKER IN THE UAE \nLake Zahker, located in a remote corner of the United Arab Emirates near the border with Oman, was the result of waste water that was released onto the land before pushing up groundwater levels to eventually result in the creation of a lake. \nPhoto: CNN \nPROVIDENCE CANYON IN GEORGIA \nProvidence Canyon, located in Lumpkin, Georgia, and known as the 'Little Grand Canyon of Georgia,' is an intricate display of massive gullies that go as deep as 150 feet. The area resulted from poor farming practices during the 1800s that led to years of soil erosion which helped form the gullies. \nPhoto: Georgia Department of Natural Resources \nGEYSERS IN MADAGASCAR \nIn Analavory, Madagascar, there are four geysers that also resulted from underground mining. Water pipelines were laid out in the nearby aragonite mines and the water began pushing upwards where the pipes end to create the spewing geysers. \nSource: alanglennon.com \nBLUE LAGOON IN ICELAND \nIceland's Blue Lagoon, in Grindavik, is a giant pool filled with geothermal saltwater. The lagoon was actually created as an over-spill from the nearby Svartsengi geothermal power station which pumps up the water from a full mile below the surface. The excess water that wasn't used to generate heat and electricity was ejected into the lagoon. \nPhoto: Daily Mail \nFROZEN BUBBLES IN ALBERTA \nUnderneath Abraham Lake, in Alberta, Canada, are stunning frozen bubbles. The bubbles are actually made of methane gas that is released by plants and animals in the artificially-created lake that resulted from the damming of the North Saskatchewan River in 1972. Considering the lake was built in an area where it wouldn't have normally been found, the increased amount of trees, grasses, and plants in the area led to a large array of the bubbles, which are starting to be looked into for industrial consumption. \nPhoto: Huffington Post \nSODA SPRINGS GEYSER IN IDAHO \nThe Soda Springs geyserin Geyser Park, Idaho, which shoots water over 70 feet into the air, was discovered in 1937 when a local man was drilling for hot water in 1937 and hit a pressurised carbon dioxide chamber. It is the only controlled geyser, having been capped and controlled by a timer that is set to release around every hour or so. \nPhoto: visitidaho.org \nLAKE NASSER IN EGYPT \nLake Nasser is one of the largest man-made bodies of water in the world, resulting from the construction of the Aswan High Dam in the late 1900s in the middle of the Egyptian desert.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T10:25:06.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
