In addition to the direct high speed service from London St Pancras to the French Alps, which stops at Moûtier, Aime La Plagne and Bourg-Saint-Maurice to provide access to resorts such as Courchevel , Méribel , Les Arcs and La Plagne , this year there are two other options available. • 10 of the best ski resorts reached by train This is the first ski season that a direct Eurostar train will run from London to Lyon; taking just over four and a half hours, the service puts passengers within easy reach of many resorts in the French Alps, such as Alpe d'Huez and Les Deux Alpes . Resorts like Tignes are easily accessed by train (Photo: Andy Parant) For those looking to travel to the Swiss Alps, Eurostar has introduced a connecting service to Geneva via Lille, with trains timed to make the connection as smooth and efficient as possible.
