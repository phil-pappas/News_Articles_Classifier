It was finally abandoned in 1990 when it became too expensive to maintain, but last year the Romanian government announced it would set aside 9.5 million euros to restore it, with renovations slated to begin later this year. \nPhotographer Romain Veillon explored the structure on a recent trip and took these haunting photographs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T17:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T18:40:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
