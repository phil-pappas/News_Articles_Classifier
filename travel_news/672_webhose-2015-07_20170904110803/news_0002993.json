Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Jul 19, 2015 Adv: \nAfter only one flight by Ethiopian Airlines to Goma, the main city in Eastern Congo, why did the Congolese aviation authorities pull the plug on those flights last week? \nThe three times a week flights were re-launched only on July 10 amid much fanfare at the airport. From initial feedback received from aviation sources in Goma, the service was highly appreciated by local residents and expatriates who were finally given the option of a globally-recognized airline to fly with instead of having to either rely on other airlines in Congo to fly to Kinshasha or else go by road all the way to Kigali to fly from there. \nAll airlines registered in Congo DR are notably on the EU blacklist which is a damning indictment of both the regulators as well as the airlines themselves. Only Lubumbashi-based Korongo, which is in part owned by Brussels Airlines, is presently meeting the exacting maintenance and training standards of the EASA while none of the other Congo DR-based airlines meet those global safety standards. \nEthiopian’s Bombardier Q400NextGen aircraft, with a routing from Addis Ababa via Entebbe to Goma, was apparently and suddenly declared unfit for the available runway space in Goma even though the authorities knew in advance what aircraft type Ethiopian Airlines was going to use, granted traffic rights, and participated in the welcoming celebrations. \nJambojet, Kenya Airways’ in-house, low-cost subsidiary, uses this aircraft type to fly a daily scheduled service from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport into the Ukunda airfield in Diani, which is considerably shorter than the available runway length in Goma. That said, other Congolese-registered airlines regularly used similar turboprop aircraft and even jets to land and take off from Goma. \nSources close to Ethiopian Airlines were at this stage not willing to comment on this situation, while discussions between airline and Congolese regulators and between the Ethiopian government and their Congolese counterparts were ongoing with the aim to restore the service as quickly as possible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T02:48:00.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
