The hour, one of sport’s most iconic disciplines, with a history stretching back more than 100 years, is as simple as it sounds: a gruelling 60-minute test of man and machine. After his unsuccessful attempt in January, Jack Bobridge, the Australian, described the experience – the pain, cramps and fatigue – as the nearest he would come to dying without actually shuffling off this mortal coil. Wiggins plumped for the word “torture” and said his attempt was the closest he would come to knowing what childbirth felt like. From the moment he set off in front of a raucous crowd of 6,000, the outcome was never in doubt And from the moment he set off in front of a raucous crowd of 6,000, the outcome was never in doubt. It was simply a question of by how much he would break the record. The high air pressure inside the velodrome – it was a hot day outside – worked against Wiggins, costing him as much as a kilometre. But he still destroyed fellow Brit Alex Dowsett's mark of 52.937km, set in May in Manchester. In doing so, Wiggins added the hour to a palmarès on track and road that also includes a Tour de France crown, four Olympic gold medals, seven world titles, three national time-trial victories, two Critérium du Dauphiné wins, Paris-Nice, the Tour of Romandy, a national road-race championship and the Tour of Britain. His versatility is mind-boggling. Jack Wilshere’s goals for England against Slovenia were stunning, and Ian Walker’s feat in becoming the first British skipper to win the Volvo Ocean Race was hugely commendable. But for capping a long and varied career with the perfect hour, Wiggins is a deserving recipient of the Liontrust Sporting Hero of the Month for June.
