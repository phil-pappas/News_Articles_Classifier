The leading leisure airline helped Manchester police arrest a local criminal who was in breach of his bail conditions.\nThe criminal was part of a group travelling back to Manchester Airport from The Algarve on Monday. Two brothers in the same party, Ben and Lee Ryan, were also issued with a public offence order and each fined £90 for stealing from the in-flight bar and intimidating staff with aggressive and rude behaviour. All three have been given a lifetime ban by Jet2.com.\nPhil Ward, managing director of Jet2.com said: “The majority of our customers are decent families looking forward to their holiday. They should not have to put up with such unnecessary disruption.\n“We are already seeing both the industry and the public respond overwhelming in support of our efforts to eradicate offensive behaviour through our Onboard Together programme. It’s also very encouraging to see that our initiative is helping the authorities capture people trying to evade the law.”\nJet2.com is calling for a national shared database of those passengers that have been banned for disruptive behaviour, as a way for airlines to tackle this growing problem together.\nSource:-Jet2.com\nRelated Posts Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building Austrian Airlines Financial Results as at 30 September 2013: Positive result gives optimism for break-even in 2013 BOC Aviation Marks 20th Year With Record Net Profit in 2013 Lufthansa Group increases result in core business MIA Director, National Counterparts Travel To Washington, D.c.
