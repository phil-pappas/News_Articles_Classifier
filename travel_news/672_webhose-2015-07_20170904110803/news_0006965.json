Flames shot at a height of 100 feet in the air. Firefighters reached to spot to douse the fire.\nThe fire took off due to drought and rising temperature along with strong winds in the region. More than six miles along with the eastern side of the Montans Park were booked six months in advance. This is the peak tourist season for camping.\nThe fire ignited on 22.07.15, and then swept along ridges near the scenic Going-to-the-Sun Road, the park’s most popular roadway, heading toward the small community of St. Mary on the park’s eastern boundary. There were more than 600 campers who had to flee from the St. Mary Glacier Park KOA.\nThe fire destroyed Baring Creek Cabin, a historic backcountry structure, torched one abandoned car and closed 21 miles of the 50-mile Going-to-the-Sun Road. Nearly 700,000 people visited the park in July last year, and about 95 percent of them traveled some length of the roadway.\nA fire has also broken out in Northern California which shut down a highway linking Sacramento and Reno, Nevada, and brought a handful of evacuations. The southeastern Washington state is also in blaze.
