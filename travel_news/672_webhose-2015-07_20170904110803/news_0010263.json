Organizers have signed a 30-year lease with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. \n\"The animal terminal will set new international airport standards for comprehensive veterinary, kenneling and quarantine services,\" Ark founder and Racebrook Chairman John J. Cuticelli Jr. said in a statement. \nAmong the new terminal's offerings: \n• A large animal departure lounge offering stalls, food and water for horses \n• Individual climate-controlled units for horses, equipped with bedding and natural light \n• LifeCare veterinary hospital offering general and emergency care including surgery and advanced diagnostics \n• A 24-hour Paradise 4 Paws pet resort featuring a bone-shaped dog pool, pet suites with a flat-screen TV option and a jungle gym for cats \n• Paradise 4 Paws grooming, obedience training and pet massage therapy \n• A livestock export handling system \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
