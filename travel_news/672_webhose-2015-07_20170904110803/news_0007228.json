For some it’s about comfort and convenience, for others it’s about escaping the daily grind on the open road. Some simply want a home-from-home in which to sleep on the move, while others want to take an active lifestyle away with them in the form of bikes, climbing gear and sports equipment. For some caravanners, being eco-friendly is vital, while others don’t want to sacrifice the driving experience. You can read more about the great things to do and the experiences to be had at Freedom to Go . High adventure: why not tour spectacular Snowdonia National Park by caravan? Whatever floats your boat (or tows your van), there is a caravan or motorhome for you, because consumer demand plus market innovation equals plenty of smart new products to choose from. Who knew, for example, that if being a green caravanner is important to you, there are now several electric campervans to choose from? Or that if you are at heart a minimalist, you can get a tiny caravan that will store in your garage but is enough to carry bikes, kites, skis and can be converted into a place to sleep. You can even go one down from that, and tow what is essentially a trailer tent, so light that a motorbike can tow it, but sturdy enough for a decent sleep. At the other end of the scale, plasma TVs, Corian worktops, central heating systems (a welcome luxury for indefatigable campers), deep-sprung mattresses on double beds, built-in microwaves and power showers are readily available for the traveller who prefers a few creature comforts. You don’t need to spend £500,000 on a caravan to have something very nice; a rather more affordable £10,000 will give you a decent two-berth At the extreme end of the scale, the Caravisio caravan prototype, which made its debut at last year’s Birmingham Motorhome and Caravan Show, shows how £500,000 looks in caravan form. It might be extreme but it reflects the growing interest in luxury caravanning, and its makers, Knaus Tabbert, called it “the future of caravanning”. Inside, there’s a wine cooler, a touchscreen display for the water system, a “smart-glass” door that can be frosted over at the touch of a button and doubles as a cinema screen, and the whole caravan is controlled via an app and biometric fingerprinting for security. Taking its exterior design cues from a superyacht, the rear of the Caravisio prototype opens up and folds down to create a boarded terrace. But back to reality… which is an attractive one for Britain’s 550,000 caravanners. The good news is that you don’t need to spend £500,000 on a caravan to have something very nice; a rather more affordable £10,000 will give you a decent two-berth. All aglow: embrace your inner explorer on a mini adventure In fact, our favourite little two-berth is the T@B model sold through Airstream dealers, which starts at about £10,000, all in. If you want to brush up your skills or fancy buying a caravan and are daunted at the prospect of a towing course, don’t be. I did one at the Caravan Club’s site near Peterborough a few years ago. Instructors are very down to earth and friendly and will have you reversing into a berth in no time. Simply contact the Camping and Caravanning Club, or the Caravan Club, and book on a manoeuvring course, or visit one of the larger caravan shows to have a go under the eye of an instructor. It’s also worth going to the section of www.gov.uk that deals with towing with a car. It will tell you what the rules are on important points such as weight limits. Then get ready to embrace your inner explorer and set off on a mini-adventure of your own.
