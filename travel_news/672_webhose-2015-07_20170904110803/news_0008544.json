The Allegiant pilot said he didn’t have enough fuel to reach another airport. \nWhen the controller said there would be a window to land in Fargo in 20 minutes, the pilot responded, “I don’t have 20 minutes.” \nIn a statement emailed to The Associated Press, Allegiant did not say whether it knew about the temporary closure at the Fargo airport. \n“At this time, we are coordinating with the FAA and the airport to investigate all channels of communication regarding the flight and the circumstances leading to the declaration of emergency,” the Las Vegas-based airline said. \nThe airline, a subsidiary of Allegiant Travel Co., focuses on flying from smaller airports to vacation destinations such as Las Vegas and Orlando, Florida.
