He also emphasised Etihad’s unique approach to constantly innovating in order to better serve customers. \n“Innovation – one of the greatest things about travel in this era is the consumer can find out so much about your business. In our culture, we don’t have passengers, we have guests and that guest experience – whether it’s first class, business class or economy – is fundamental, and treating the guest with respect,” he said. \nMr Hogan also discussed Etihad’s business model, which extends the airline’s organic growth through codeshare partnerships and equity investments in key global airlines, including airberlin, Air Serbia, Air Seychelles, Aer Lingus, Alitalia, Jet Airways, Virgin Australia and Swiss-based Darwin Airline. The airline’s hub in Abu Dhabi now serves as a gateway between the Middle East, Asia and Australia and destinations in Europe and America. \nEtihad will inaugurate its first A380 service between New York’s John F Kennedy International Airport and Abu Dhabi on December 1. In the US, the Business Studios are already available to travellers who fly from Washington’s Dulles International Airport to Abu Dhabi – and beyond.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T22:27:05.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
