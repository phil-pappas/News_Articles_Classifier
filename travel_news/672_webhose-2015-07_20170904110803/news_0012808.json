Source: Getty Images \nA TINY, independent island in the Irish Sea doesn’t sound like the most likely location for the world’s deadliest race. \nBut the Isle of Man TT (Tourist Trophy) Race has seen more fatalities than any other motorcycle race — albeit in 100 years — with riders urging their bikes around narrow, winding roads and crumbling farmhouses at more than 300km/h. \nMany of the 246 killed in the race were professionals taking part in the fastest division, the Senior TT. But others were amateurs, who compete on the 60km Snaefell Mountain Course on “Mad Sunday”, in the middle of the two-week event. \nAttempts to protect riders at the most dangerous parts of the course have been made with safety bales wrapped around phone boxes and other obstacles. \nA report by Jalopnik describes a Frenchman killed in practice this year , on a straight section of the infamous course. Another rider, Jamie Hamilton, was airlifted to hospital after he crashed during the Senior TT. More than 240 riders have died over 100 years of the race. Source: News Limited The deadly race is held on public roads, considered more dangerous than a closed circuit, particularly when the island’s roads are old.

Another rider, Gary Johnson, broke his collarbone and cracked a vertebrae in his neck, “but generally has escaped very lightly it seems”, according to a cheerful tweet from his team. \nIn the TT’s deadliest year, 1970, six competitors lost their lives, with another racer perishing during the island’s Manx Grand Prix later the same year. \nThe crowds, standing just metres away from the speeding motorbikes, aren’t immune from the danger. In 2013, Jonathan Howarth ploughed into the crowd on his first lap, injuring 11 onlookers — 10 days after Japanese rider Yoshinari Matsushita, 43, was killed in a qualifying session. \nAustralian spectators Dean Jacob, 33, and Gregory Kenzig, 52, and rider Marc Ramsbotham died in a 2007 collision. Spectators lining the roads have been injured and killed by out-of-control bikes. Source: News Limited The race shows no sign of slowing down.

The Isle of Man, 354 square kilometres in size and home to 85,000 people, is now one of the few places in the world where a motorcycle race is still held on public roads. \nTo outsiders, its record looks bad, but the race attracts 10,000 motorsport enthusiasts each year, who point out that more people are killed in road traffic accidents in every day life. \nIt was the island’s autonomy that first saw the race held here in the 1900s, when speed limits in England were a pitiful 30km/h. And a world without rules and regulations, just a ferry ride away from the UK, still has massive appeal. \nDeath a high price to pay for the excitement of taking on these twisting, treacherous roads, but racers “don’t go there thinking that they are going to end up as another statistic,” says marshall Suzanne Hitchinson. \nFor as long as they can, thrillseekers looking for that buzz will keep on coming.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T06:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T11:17:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
