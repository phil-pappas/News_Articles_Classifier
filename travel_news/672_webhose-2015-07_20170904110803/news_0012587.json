No wonder it . Picture: airbnb Source: Supplied\nThe four bedroom, four bathroom elegantly furnished Mediterranean villa located right on the beach is any holiday-maker’s dream, and Carey and Packer are sparing no expense as they continue their globetrotting whirlwind romance. Beachside relaxing ... You couldn’t get any more beachfront than this. Picture: airbnb Source: Supplied\nSnapped by a throng of paparazzi wherever they go, it’s not often we get to actually check out the interior of their lavish lifestyle — but with this sumptuous Airbnb listing we can see their digs for ourselves. (The listing has been swiftly removed from the Airbnb website this morning)\nMaking a grand entrance ... The magnificent open plan offers great views of the beach. Picture: airbnb Source: Supplied\nThe property boasts living room with fireplace, large entertaining bar, indoor/outdoor spa jacuzzi, high ceilings, walls of french doors. A gourmet kitchen with an open see-through fireplace opens on a grand dining area.\nRub a dub dub ... The lagoon-like bath is positively diva-worthy. Picture: airbnb Source: Supplied\nBut wait til you hear about the large luxurious bath suite with steam room and beach-facing balcony — which surely a diva like Mariah is perfectly suited to.\nMaster suite ... With views overlooking Carbon Beach. Picture: airbnb Source: Supplied\nAccording to E! Mariah has already hit up the local eatery Nobu and has “fallen in love” with the home.\nSumptuous ... The shower alone looks bigger than an inner-Sydney studio apartment. Picture: airbnb Source: Supplied\nWe bet the pair will feel right at home with neighbours Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, entertainment mogul David Geffen, former Dodgers CEO Jamie McCourt, and other business tycoons.\nMeals with friends ... Though Mariah doesn’t seem like the type to slave over a hot stove. Picture: airbnb Source: Supplied\nYou too could hit up the property for a night or two, providing you’ve got a spare few thousand or 10 in the bank.", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/31/1227464/576060-a140dda8-3715-11e5-9208-acda9fc3b494.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/31/1227464/574412-9e651c16-3715-11e5-9208-acda9fc3b494.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/31/1227464/575043-a0237656-3715-11e5-9208-acda9fc3b494.jpg", "http://au.eonline.com/news/681796/mariah-carey-and-james-packer-shacking-up-in-malibu-see-their-10k-a-day-digs", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/31/1227464/576265-9f077fba-3715-11e5-9208-acda9fc3b494.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/31/1227464/574332-9b5f267e-3715-11e5-9208-acda9fc3b494.jpg", "https://www.instagram.com/p/5w29mVLeK7/embed", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/31/1227464/575395-9a286aa4-3715-11e5-9208-acda9fc3b494.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/31/1227464/576151-a0b19ada-3715-11e5-9208-acda9fc3b494.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-31T20:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T13:32:26.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
