He’s just announced there’s a bear milling beyond the trees, metres from where we sit.\nBut, rather than bolting in the opposite direction, we’re frozen stiff. Cameras, phones and iPads are at the ready and our carriage erupts in a cheer as a lanky black bear comes into view, looking back over its shoulder for the money shot.\nIt’s second-time lucky for some. My now-happy fellow passenger clearly wasn’t in the vestibule yesterday when we spied a bear cub and its mother munching yellow wildflowers beside the Thompson River.\nMORE: What it’s like working on the Rocky Mountaineer\nCALL OF NATURE: Explore the vistas of Seattle\nCapturing the view ... the open-air vestible on the Rocky Mountaineer. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nThis is exactly why 320 eager travellers have boarded the inaugural journey of the 25th anniversary of the Rocky Mountaineer : to meet nature face to face.\nBut, for me, the opportunity to completely disconnect from technology (there’s no Wi-Fi or phone service on board) and have nothing to do except sit back and enjoy the ride, was almost more attractive than the promise of bears and moose.\nWe’re travelling the Journey Through the Clouds route from Vancouver to Kamloops and on to Jasper to tick off that top-of-many-a-bucket-list attraction, the Rocky Mountains. And we’re doing it in style.\nInside the Rocky Mountaineer ... host Bernardo serving local wines and cheeses. Picture: Celeste Mitchell Source: Supplied\nThere are varying levels of service aboard the Rocky Mountaineer but, for 90 per cent of Australians who make the journey, it’s GoldLeaf all the way. Besides the obvious attraction of glass-domed ceilings and almost 360-degree views, the double-decker design of the carriages provides a chance to make meals more of an occasion – a worthy occasion, given the high quality of food served up.\nBreakfast is called in two sittings and since we’re in the second group we get to nosh on freshly baked cinnamon scones and coffee before ambling down the spiral staircase to the dining room. There’s a generous spread of fresh fruit, buttery croissants and menu items ranging from pancakes to a “Gold Rush” scramble topped with smoked salmon and creme fraiche. The chefs may only have a kitchen the size of a food truck to work in, but the standard of the meals being expertly plated up and served is excellent.\nGourmet railway nosh ... the Gold Rush scramble breakfast served in GoldLeaf aboard the Rocky Mountaineer. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nOur 901km journey is spread over two days, so the speed is set to comfortably allow you to take in the landscape. As I flick the recline lever on my seat and bask in the view of the Fraser Canyon, time slows to meet the hypnotising churn of the train’s wheels on the tracks.\nThe time passes listening to the commentary and flicking through the Mile Post newspaper – a hard-copy GPS for where we’re travelling each day. Names like Hell’s Gate (where 750 million litres of water a minute gush through the narrowest part of the Fraser River), Avalanche Alley and Jaws of Death Gorge are in stark contrast to the beauty of the terrain we’re traversing.\nIncredible views ... rolling through the Fraser Canyon on the Rocky Mountaineer. Picture: Celeste Mitchell Source: Supplied\nThe route we’re following matches that of The Overlanders – pioneers who crossed the Rockies on foot during the mid-1800s, including a particularly tough lass by the name of Elizabeth Schubert, who gave birth to her fourth child on reaching Kamloops.\nTo say it’s difficult to imagine the treacherous journey while we sip local wines and swap travel tales with new friends on-board is an understatement.\nAt dusk on day one, we pull into Kamloops (population: 80,000) to a friendly Mountie welcome, where the nearby wineries of the Okanagan Valley seem, at first impression, to be the main attraction.\nIn fact, up until 2006, the Rocky Mountaineer ran a dinner theatre review in town to entertain their guests. But we soon quash any negative thoughts and discover there’s a fresh vibe in the outpost at brewpub, The Noble Pig.\nFamous ride ... the Rocky Mountaineer is one of the world's most iconic rail journeys celebrating 25 years in 2015. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nManager Dustin greets us in full hipster trifecta, with his beard, round specs and bolo tie a cowboy twist on the trend.\nWe devour plates of tasty fried pickles, dipped in spicy dill ranch sauce, washing them down with jugs of Pale Ale and Dunkle (dark wheat beer).\nAfter a full day of fine-dining on the train, it’s the perfect shot of casualness to keep us on an even keel.\nMy king bed envelops me at the one-year-old Sandman Signature Hotel and I nearly sleep through my alarm to meet our departure the next morning.\nOne of the bonuses of GoldLeaf is not worrying about trivial things like luggage. Our bags will be picked up from the rooms and transported separately to the train and then on to the Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge, where we will arrive later that afternoon.\nOn day two of the trip, the scenery transforms dramatically as the arid landscape and richly coloured cliff faces make way for dense rows of firs, waterfalls and frosty lakes. Not long after another sumptuous lunch, fresh snowfall turns our view into a wintry wonderland. Our hosts play up to it, switching the soundtrack to Christmas carols and serving mugs of Baileys-laced hot chocolate. It’s 5pm somewhere, right?\nAs thrilling as it was to spot bears from the train, arriving to a congregation of elk and deer on our doorstep at the Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge is the icing on the Canada cupcake.\nLocal fauna ... Elk are like kangaroos in Jasper. They’re everywhere. Picture: Celeste Mitchell Source: Supplied\nThe next morning, the temperature has dropped from 19C in Vancouver to -8C, as we stand at 2277m above sea level at the top of the Jasper SkyTram – a quick and easy way to get an eagle-eye view of the boomerang-shaped town nestled within the 10,878 sq km national park.\nFrom here we can see almost every intricate jagged peak of the Rocky Mountains that surrounds us and the turquoise glacial lakes of Jasper – their brilliant colour a result of “rock flour” sediment, created by rocks grinding together underneath the glacier.\nIn town, we stroll past cute cottages and shop in stores with names like Bearfoot in the Park, Big Horn and Bear Paw Bakery.\nIf not for the construction of the railway – built between 1881 and 1885 to connect Canada east to west – this dream-filled landscape would have remained hidden to the world.\n“If we can’t export the scenery, we’ll import the tourists,” Canadian Pacific Railway’s president William Van Horne said as he set about building hotels that would entice visitors from abroad to use his railway and connect the dots across the Rockies.\nSpotting wildlife ... one of the highlights of the Rocky Mountaineer journey. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nCelebrities came flocking, as did the royals. Now the Rocky Mountaineer is the only passenger train to traverse the Canadian Pacific Railway, allowing a glimpse into the past at these original chalet-style tourist towns.\nWe travel the next leg of the journey by motorcoach and, while the shock of being confined to a bus seat sinks in, the Rockies of my dreams materialises outside the window along Alberta’s Highway 93, which connects Jasper with Lake Louise. Within two hours we’re gleefully catching snowflakes on our tongues and clambering aboard a snowmobile that will take us up onto the surface of the Athabasca Glacier at the Columbia Icefields.\nLush landscapes ... passing Pyramid Falls located on the east side of the North Thompson River between the towns of Blue River and Valemount. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nLater that afternoon, we round a bend and our driver Bob pumps the brakes. It’s not the epic scenery stopping us in our tracks but two mountain goats licking salt from the highway. It’s illegal to honk them, so we wait patiently and edge forward gently until they move to the side and we get under way again.\nWe drive down Bear St, turn right at Moose St and giggle as we pass Squirrel and Beaver streets, definitely sensing the theme. By 5pm we’re settling into our castle in the wild, the Fairmont Banff Springs.\nOne fun fact Bernardo spun us on the Rocky Mountaineer is bears can eat up to 4kg of food a day leading up to hibernation, having a final feast of gravel to block them up while they snooze. After the three-course fondue feast we’ve just devoured at the Alpine-fabulous Waldhaus Restaurant at Banff Springs, we might just need to follow suit.\nGO2\nCANADA\nGETTING THERE\nQantas flies to LA from Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne with onward connections to Vancouver via WestJet. qantas.com.au\nSTAYING THERE\nGoldLeaf service hotel options with Rocky Mountaineer packages include the Fairmont Hotel Vancouver, Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge and Fairmont Banff Springs.
