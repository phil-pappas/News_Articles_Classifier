Its roadmap process assessed the entire biofuel supply chain, including procurement of raw materials, production of sustainable aviation fuel, blending biofuel with conventional petroleum jet fuel and how biofuel will be incorporated into an airport's fueling infrastructure. \nAs part of Boeing's commitment to protect the environment and support long-term sustainable growth for commercial aviation, the company has active biofuel projects on six continents, including in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Africa, China, Europe, Middle East and Southeast Asia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T21:24:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
