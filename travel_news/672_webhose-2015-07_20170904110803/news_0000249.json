SEAN SCOTT PHOTOGRAPHY Cars For Sale \nIT'S a match made in paradise. \nRenowned Gold Coast- based photographer Sean Scott has been sharing photos of his family's holiday at Kingfisher Bay Resort and, judging by the images, Fraser Island has certainly captured his imagination. \n\"I've been driving on beaches for years but I still love it as much as I did when I first hit the beach here on Fraser Island 20 years ago,\" Mr Scott said. \nKingfisher Bay Resort's David Hay said the photographer's visit was a coup for the region. \n\"Not only does Sean have more than 200,000 followers on his Instagram pages - who have been busy liking and commenting and wishing they were on Fraser - but he'll take away some beautiful and iconic images of our island home and hopefully that will inspire people visiting his galleries to come and visit the Fraser Coast,\" Mr Hay said. \nYou can follow Sean and his Fraser Coast adventures on Instagram @seanscottphotography or visit his gorgeous photographic galleries in Coolangatta and Burleigh Heads. \nTOP STORIES ONLINE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T21:51:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
