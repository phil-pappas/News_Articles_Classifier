The 36-guest Safari Explorer sails weeklong Hawaiian Seascapes cruises from November through April and the savings is good on select dates. \n“We welcome Hawaii-bound travelers to say Aloha to our inclusive yacht adventure in the islands this year,” said Captain Dan Blanchard, CEO. “Seeing four islands by yacht with guided tours and water sports at your fingertips is unlike any other vacation option you’ll find in Hawaii.” \nHawai‘i cruises sail one-way between Hawai‘i and Moloka‘i or reverse and explore four islands—Hawai’i, Lana’i, Maui and Moloka’i. With an aft swim step and a full complement of water sports equipment, guests aboard the Safari Explorer enjoy the freedom of water exploration. Guests enjoy kayaking, skiff explorations, paddle boarding, snorkeling, and swimming off the yacht’s swim step. Shoreside tours and hiking provide interior explorations of the islands. \nThe island itinerary visits Lana’i with a scenic hiking excursion to the island’s spatter and cinder cone and a visit to the Lana’i Culture and Heritage Center. An overnight off Moloka’i with a full day of cultural activities includes a day trip into the Halawa Valley with a choice of a hike to a secluded waterfall or time spent on Anakala Pilipo’s land learning the ways of traditional Hawaiian life. In the evening, a visit to the Moloka’i Museum and a traditional Pa’ina feast with music and dancing round out the day. Off Olowalu, Maui, snorkelers encounter sea turtle habitat, coral gardens and tropical fish. In Honomalino Bay, Hawai’i, skiffs and kayaks explore around the islands lava tubes. \nOther highlights include a night snorkel with Giant Pacific Manta rays and snorkeling at Kealakekua Bay where Captain Cook was slain in 1779. In the Humpback National Marine Sanctuary, expedition cruising allows time for searching out marine life—humpback whales, dolphins, green sea turtles and other marine life. \nCruise rates in Hawaii begin at $3,595 per person, double occupancy before the savings. Included in the cruise fare are premium spirits, fine wines and microbrews; superb hand-crafted meals featuring local Hawaiian flavors; massage; guided tours geared toward small groups; from-yacht activities and equipment; transfers; lei greeting; and port charges and taxes.
