The tourism sector has been calling for a wider recognition of its significant contribution to the UK economy for many years, and also for a better understanding of how the work not just of DCMS but of many government departments including the Home Office, Treasury and BIS has an impact on tourism, including leisure, business and educational. \nSandra Matthews Marsh MBE, chairman of The Tourism Society, commented: “Today’s announcement, which includes details of the government’s plan to spread the benefits of tourism right across the UK, is extremely important and shows that our industry - the fifth largest in the UK - is getting the attention it deserves at the highest level. Rail and infrastructure were highlighted as the hot topic at this year’s Tourism Symposium and I am very pleased to see that the Prime Minister has picket these up as one of the key focus areas for the new group. Tourism Society members work in businesses throughout the country and they will all gain from this. I urge them to support the plan and work with us to maintain this new momentum and engagement with government.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T21:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T22:08:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
