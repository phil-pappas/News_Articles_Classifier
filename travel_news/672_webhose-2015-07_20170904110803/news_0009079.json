A total number of 680,381 people travelled to and from the emirate during Eid Al Fitr. \nGDRFA officials also said 728 ships used Dubai’s sea port, with 356 arriving in the emirate and 372 departing. \n“The Directorate is committed to providing the best services to all its customers,” Maj Gen Al Merri said, “as per the directives of His Highness Shaikh Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai.” \nThe GDRFA director also praised the directorate’s employees for their commitment and for doing their job to the fullest during the Eid break, as it contributed greatly to the ease of entry and exit of visitors to Dubai. \nLast year, an estimated 590,000 people, 28 per cent from the GCC, visited the emirate. However, as last year’s Eid fell on a Monday, last year’s celebrations enjoyed an extended weekend, which could account for the higher number of visitors. Public sector workers last year enjoyed a nine-day Eid break.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T05:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T09:38:21.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
