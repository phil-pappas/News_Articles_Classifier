Creole-speaking countries will once again converge on Seychelles to join in the celebrations of Festival Kreol. \n“In this edition we will bring together a spectacular representation of Creole-speaking countries and showcase Victoria as the Creole Capital of the world.” \nThe Ministry of Tourism and Culture is counting on the opening of the music stadium to stage the official opening of Festival Kreol. New activities will also emerge in the program of this year’s edition of Festival Kreol, bringing the festival closer to the community. \"This is a celebration for all who see themselves as Seychellois. It is our nation celebrating who we are today, as we understand where we have come from,\" said Minister St.Ange. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
