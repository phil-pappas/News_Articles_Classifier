Sign In Here As airline executives and consumers debate whether major U.S. carriers have throttled capacity to boost profits, new industry data shows that North Texas is a big winner in the number of passenger seats available on flights. The number of seats offered weekly by U.S. airlines at North Texas’ two major airports jumped 11.7 percent over the past four years, compared with a 2.2 percent increase nationally. North Texas got one of every four new seats added by the airlines nationwide, according to masFlight, a flight tracking firm that works with airline schedule publisher OAG. The number of seats on planes arriving and departing from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and its smaller rival, Dallas Love Field , grew by 96,202 weekly during the four years tracked, compared with 388,053 weekly at all major U.S. airports. Airline seats offered at the two North Texas airports totaled 918,759 this month, up from 822,257 flights weekly in July 2011. Love Field’s seat offerings jumped by more than 58,000 weekly in the four-year timeframe, rising to 176,823 weekly from 118,232 four years ago. D/FW Airport’s seat offerings grew by more than 37,000 weekly, increasing to 741,936 from 704,325. Although seat counts rose 2.2 percent nationwide, masFlight/OAG found the number of domestic flights dropped 6.8 percent nationwide over the past four years, as airlines added narrower seats and placed them closer together. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether the largest U.S. airlines, including Fort Worth-based American Airlines and Dallas-based Southwest Airlines , colluded to curtail flight capacity so they could boost prices. The flight and seat data does not support the argument that airlines are colluding, but rather that the carriers are retiring older, smaller aircraft and replacing them with larger, more efficient planes, said Tulinda Larsen , president of masFlight. Smaller cities end up losing flights because of fleet upgrades and other factors at play in the airline industry, Larsen said. “The cost to serve small or medium-size communities is increasing with the security charges and all the other charges that are associated with flying these days,” she said. North Texas has seen a bigger increase in airline seat offerings and flight availability because of the lifting of flight restrictions at Love Field that existed under the Wright Amendment and because American Airlines switched to a new system of scheduling at D/FW Airport that bunches flights at hubs to tighten connections and raise revenue, Larsen said. \nWant Dallas Travel news in your inbox?
