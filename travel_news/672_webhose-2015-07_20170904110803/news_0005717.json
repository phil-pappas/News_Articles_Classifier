Now I felt the urge to return to that solitude, to recalibrate myself by again meditating on the stark landscapes that once served as backdrops for many melancholy films by Ingmar Bergman.\nUntil 1974, Furillen was the site of a working limestone quarry. Later, the area was closed to civilians while it was used for military exercises. In 1999, inspired by the dramatic light and desolate setting, the Swedish photographer Johan Hellstrom purchased the former quarry grounds, complete with giant rock mounds and old factory buildings, one of which was converted into Fabriken Furillen, a luxury hotel with 18 stylish rooms. But what interested me were the eremitkojor, or hermit huts — isolated cabins lacking electricity and running water — that the hotel maintains in the wild landscape that surrounds it. It was in one of these huts that I would embark on a five-day digital detox.\nPhoto The author’s hermit hut at Furillen. The cabins lack electricity and running water. Credit James Silverman for The New York Times Last summer, after a 40-minute flight from Stockholm, I made the hourlong drive north from the city of Visby. On this trip, I was joined by my husband, Dave. While his dependence on technology is relatively mild, he was intrigued by the idea of back-to-nature isolation.\nAs we approached the slim isthmus that connects Gotland to Furillen, he asked, “Is it time?”\nIt was. I quickly checked my email and scrolled through my Instagram feed one last time before handing the phone to Dave, who would lock it with a pass code to which I was not privy.\nAt the hotel, we were instructed to follow two employees in a dust-covered sedan down a rocky dirt road, which after a bumpy mile fed into a smaller trail before finally ending in a grassy clearing near Furillen’s southernmost tip. A few yards away, camouflaged in a thicket of pine trees and bushes, were our accommodations: a one-room wooden hut with a slanted tin roof and weatherworn shingles. We were shown the adjacent outhouse and handed the keys as a light rain began to fall. And then we were alone, with no threat of a vibrating iPhone or pinging computer clamoring for our attention. Instead, I found my ear fixing on the sound of waves folding into the nearby shore.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Stepping inside the tiny, 84-square-foot hut meant entering the coziest living space imaginable. Curly-haired lambskin rugs covered the wooden floor. An iron wood-burning stove stood beside the door. There was a double bed nestled into one corner beside a small table with a stainless-steel oil lamp. A chair upholstered in more gray lambskin occupied another corner, and built-in shelves provided sufficient space for the few things we’d brought with us: food, clothes and, most important, books.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story On the top of my stack was “Den Farliga Leken” by Mari Jungstedt, a Swedish crime novelist who set this book’s grisly action on Furillen — in one of the hermit huts. (The book recently came out in English under the title “The Dangerous Game.”) As darkness fell and the murder-heavy plot unfolded, I tried to suppress images of blood splattering across the hut’s whitewashed walls. Dave was rereading a favorite, Don DeLillo’s “Underworld,” and regularly broke the silence to read choice passages aloud.\nAfter a fitful night’s sleep, haunted by scenes from my book, I awoke early to bright sunshine and decided to explore the surroundings on a run. I started along a path parallel to the rocky shoreline of limestone pebbles and then cut across a coastal meadow of tall wild grass and wind-twisted shrubs. Without a Spotify playlist to lose myself in, I noticed subtle beauty along the way, like vermilion clusters of jewel-like hawthorn berries on trailside bushes and pale violet wildflowers peeking through the underbrush. What else had I been blind to while distracted by electronics, I wondered.\nLater on the run, I encountered towering wind turbines with graceful blades whooshing audibly overhead. Pausing to watch their arcing shadows sweep across the field, I felt a strong urge to record the scene. Not being able to share the moment made me feel, preposterously, as if it had never happened.\nContinue reading the main story 10 miles\nFARO\nBergman Center\nFabriken Furillen\nFURILLEN\nVisby\nBaltic Sea\nKraklingbo/\nKrakas Krog\nGOTLAND\nFIN.\nSWEDEN\nNOR.\nStockholm\nArea of detail\nDEN.\nCopenhagen\nMap data by OpenStreetMap\nJULY 9, 2015\nBy The New York Times Still in the mood to explore after the run, I persuaded Dave to take the 15-minute car ferry to Faro, an even smaller island north of Gotland with only about 550 year-round residents. There we drove past flocks of sheep and fields of sculptural rauker — limestone formations eroded into fantastical shapes over millenniums — before ending at the Bergman Center, a museum dedicated to Ingmar Bergman’s time on the island, where he lived and worked for the last 40 years of his life.\nAs a passing rainstorm pelted the museum’s roof, we watched film clips that illustrated the director’s dominant themes.\n“It’s curious that you would come to Gotland and Faro, a place associated with Bergman’s existentialist films, to go off the grid and in a sense stop existing to others,” Dave said during a scene from “Persona,” before wandering to another room.\nBut I questioned whether that was what I really wanted: to disappear, at least online.\nBack in the hut, I quickly finished the thriller and moved on to the first installment in Karl Ove Knausgaard’s Proustian series, “My Struggle.” The narrative of a writer struggling to create something meaningful in his life resonated deeply. Delving into his story, I found myself re-evaluating my own, wondering how I’d allowed myself to become so habituated to sharing ephemera online that suddenly not doing so made me feel invisible. Now, disconnected from the imposed (or imagined) pressures from followers and friends loitering unseen in the ether of the web, I found myself reaching for a more authentic, balanced existence for myself, online and off.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story The digital liberation also allowed me to develop an easy routine. On sunny afternoons, Dave and I took our books outside and lounged on wooden folding chairs. On cloudy days, we turned the pages inside the hut beneath a thick woolen blanket. Long walks around the tranquil peninsula book ended this rediscovered pleasure of uninterrupted reading, free of time constraints and external demands. When the sun set, we lit the oil lamp and played cards by the flickering light. Dining by the lamp’s dim light, we spread liver pâté and soft cheeses on sourdough baguettes, and polished off bags of loose candies filled with sour gummies and salted licorice.\nMost mornings we walked a half-hour along the rocky dirt road back to the hotel’s main building for breakfast. Along the way, the only tweets I encountered were from birds. Instead I fed my craving for news about the wider world with the only newspapers available, two small-circulation dailies in which I learned about the heated controversy surrounding a speed camera installation and a local greenhouse growing the first harvest of melons in Sweden.\nOn our last full day, the newspapers forecast sun, so after breakfast we borrowed two Skeppshult bicycles from the hotel and pedaled toward the old quarry’s craterlike excavation site. After passing enormous bedrock pools of unnaturally vivid green water, I crested a steep hill and spotted an even greater anomaly below: an overturned yellow car, its roof crushed, wheels splayed in the air and a useless spare tire a few yards away. From my cliff-top vantage point, the rusted vehicle looked like an upside-down bug, lifeless and long forgotten.\nPhoto Moments of reflection at a former limestone quarry. Credit James Silverman for The New York Times I pulled out my camera and took a photo, one that I knew would never get a single “like” from anyone but me. And that was just fine.\nThat evening, we drove to dinner at Krakas Krog, a lovely restaurant in a former post office in the village of Kraklingbo, about an hour south of Furillen. After a six-course meal laden with seasonal delicacies — chanterelles and wild herbs, crisp green beans and local truffles — we headed back to the hut in pitch darkness. As I got out of the car, I looked up and was startled to see so many stars in the sky.\nBut what was above us could no longer be called simply sky, for the infinite grandeur that stretched overhead had moved squarely into the territory of the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson: the capital “C” Cosmos. The space above appeared not as a flat black canvas with carefully arranged white dots, but as a three-dimensional parade of stars begetting stars farther and farther away on a journey into the past. I was reminded of a passage Dave had read aloud from “Underworld”:\n“Sometimes I see something so moving I know I’m not supposed to linger. See it and leave. If you stay too long, you wear out the wordless shock. Love it and trust it and leave.”\nAnd so we did. Besides, those spellbinding heavens are always hiding in plain sight above us, if only we would unplug long enough to notice.\nIf You Go Fabriken Furillen, Rute Furillen, Larbro; furillen.com/en ; 5,555 Swedish kronor, or $677 at 8.20 kronor to the dollar, for the suggested five-night stay in a hermit hut.\nBergman Center, Faro; bergmancenter.se /en; admission, 90 kronor.\nKrakas Krog, Kraklings 223, Katthammarsvik; krakas.se ; six-course menu, 850 kronor.", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/12/travel/12SWEDEN3/12SWEDEN3-superJumbo.jpg", "http://www.krakas.se/", "http://bergmancenter.se/en/", "http://www.furillen.com/en/", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/12/travel/12SWEDEN2/12SWEDEN2-blog427.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/12/travel/12SWEDEN2/12SWEDEN2-superJumbo.jpg", "http://www.google-analytics.com/ga.js", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/12/travel/12SWEDEN3/12SWEDEN3-blog427.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-10T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T16:05:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
