Hackers accessed the company’s digital infrastructure through its heating and ventilation control system. HP print technologist Howard Roberts mentions the incident to highlight the new pathways criminals and hackers are using to access company data. “The big companies are making it harder to get in through what you might call the well-established routes, so hackers are looking to find other ways into an organisation,” he says. One often-overlooked spot, especially for SMEs, can be the printer network, and one of the most common security breaches is breathtakingly simple. “Most breaches come from people leaving printed documents on top of the printer,” says Mr Roberts. In fact, research suggests up to 30 per cent of printouts are not collected from the machine, and many more can be left for hours before anyone picks them up. When you think of the business-sensitive information regularly reproduced as hard copy by the average SME – from supplier and customer contracts to notes on the latest strategy meeting – you get some sense of the security risk those lapse printer practices represent. Private Print reduces the risk that sensitive information will fall into the wrong hands The answer is provided by HP JetAdvantage Private Print technology, a free cloud-based business solution that replaces vulnerable push models of printing with a more controllable and secure pull model. In practice that means users send a document to the cloud and only pull it to the printer when they are ready to receive it. The document is tightly encrypted on every step of its digital journey, and users authenticate themselves with a PIN or proximity badge at the printer before their document prints, significantly reducing the risk that sensitive information will fall into the wrong hands. Private Print helps ensure confidential documents stay that way, and offers other advantages too. SMEs spend a lot of money in paper, power and toner printing documents that end up in the recycling bin but the user authentication required by Private Print encourages more selective and thoughtful printing. It reduces waste and cost by encouraging staff to only print documents that need to be printed. And printing from the cloud allows for other efficiencies, too. Users manage their print jobs from almost anywhere with either a laptop or mobile device, and can print important documents wherever and whenever business demands. A user could send a document to the print queue from an office in London in the morning, for example, and collect it – after authentication - from a compatible device in Edinburgh in the afternoon, an innovation that also sidesteps the risks of travelling with sensitive information. Compatible devices include more than 60 HP Enterprise and Professional Laser Jet and OfficeJet printers, with more in the pipeline. HP JetAdvantage Private Print offers SMEs a cloud business printing solution that enhances security and reduces cost, at a fraction of the price of an in-house alternative. • Find out more about HP JetAdvantage Private Print here Now read on... • Win a technology makeover with HP BusinessNow • The inkjet revival is here • Go global with HP • Technology for business: smarter office, better worker • SMEs at risk as XP stutters along • How HP’s Elite family can solve your business problems", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T22:49:23.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
