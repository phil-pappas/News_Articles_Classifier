Thome, eTN Africa Correspondent | Jul 24, 2015 Adv: \nWhen the news came in earlier this morning, that British Airways, after months of denying the rumours, had finally confirmed their intent to halt flights from London to Entebbe, was the reaction swift and brutal. \n‘They took us for fools. The writing was on the wall for quite some time after they ditched Dar es Salaam. British Airways had everything going for them in the 90’s and could have, in fact should have gone daily way before the likes of Emirates came into Entebbe. But they diddled and fiddled around and instead cut their representation back. Even the top guy moved from Nairobi to South Africa. It is just like with getting Visa to Britain, their High Commission too shifted this out of Uganda. I can only say good riddance, they made a mess of things instead of grabbing market opportunities. No one is shedding a tear here I tell you’ ranted a periodic contributor from among the top ranked travel agencies in Kampala, who by admission hardly sold BA any longer and had shifted his passengers to the Gulf airlines for long haul flights. \nThe last flight from Heathrow to Entebbe will take place on the 02nd of October and the return flight will subsequently leave Uganda back for the UK on the 03rd of October.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T22:25:29.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
