Do you love to be frightened? Would you like to solve a crime? Then the GGT Extreme Terror Tour is for you!” it said. \nGoulburn Ghost Tours manager Louise Edwards told Channel Ten that the company had received a lot of hate mail but also many “poignant and thoughtful” emails about why the tours should be cancelled, which “made us see this in a different light”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T13:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T13:58:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
