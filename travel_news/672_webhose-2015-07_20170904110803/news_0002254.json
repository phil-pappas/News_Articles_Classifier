Its Black Planet bar is popular for sunset aperitifs and private dinners. \nSnorkelers dipping their mask into the water are greeted by black crystal-clear scenery. \nThe island is home to loggerhead turtles and there's a hospital dedicated to helping heal those hurt on fishermen's hooks. \nAt night, under starry skies, the turtles come ashore to lay their eggs. \nA hike into the island's center reveals Monte Vulcano, an extinct volcano covered in fluorescent green prickly pears. \nThe island's main village is a bunch of low-rise pink and green dwellings. \nGetting there: Flights connect Rome and Milan to Lampedusa island, which is linked to Linosa by ferry . \nStaying there: Casa Faro (+39 3336846636) is a typical island dwelling for rentals. \nEating there: Errera serves traditional cuisine. \nLinosa Errera | Via Scalo Vecchio 1, Sicily Italy \nSusak (Croatia) \n\nFewer than 200 inhabitants greet visitors to this three-kilometer square island, a former Roman settlement known for its grapes. \nThough it was once the scene of a bitter clash between Venetians and Saracens, this tiny island has largely existed in isolation. \nEven today locals speak a dialect that most Croatians struggle to comprehend. \nThe stone-built streets of the old town are, like the rest of the island, car free -- only tractors, wheelbarrows and bicycles are allowed. \nThere are no banks or ATMs, but there's a post office. \nBok Beach's shallow waters and hot sands are said to have healing powers. \nEating there: Knob Ankora (Susak 13; +38 5998388909) serves local lamb specialties. \nGetting there: Flights connect Zagreb and Split to Krk in Rab island, which is linked to Susak via a catamaran to Mali Losinj and then ferry . \nStaying there: Sansego rents sea-view studios. Chrisi (Greece) \n\nThis former pirate island with palm trees, sand dunes and emerald waters lies south of Crete in the Libyan sea. \nThere's a dense Lebanon cedar forest, a medieval chapel, Minoan ruins and Roman graves. \nVisitors can cross it barefoot, but staying the night is prohibited -- camping and campfires are forbidden. \nThe atoll has one small tavern and a bar on Belegrina beach. \nBelegrina, also known as \"Golden beach,\" is covered in broken shells, coral and fossils that the Byzantines used to make a scarlet dye for coloring the cloaks of Europe's royalty. \nGetting there: A ferry links Chrisi to Lerapetra on Crete's southern coast, reachable by car from the Cretan capital, Heraklion. \nStaying there: Cretan Villa Hotel overlooks the isle. \nCretan Villa Hotel | Lakerda 16, Ierapetra, Crete 72200 Greece \nGolden beach: Chrissi Island, Greece. \nMedes (Spain) \n\nSpain's beautiful northeastern Costa Brava can get crowded with visitors in the summer, but these seven islands just off the fishing village of Estartit are a peaceful world away. \nA marine park of 16,000 square meters, the islands host ruins of a wall built by the crusading Knights of the Holy Sepulcher. \nGuided tours by biologists are held twice a year to the islands, which are a top snorkeling and diving site. \nThe reefs of Carall Bernatt and Tascons swarm with lobsters, giant groupers and even some bigger predators. \nGetting there: Boats leave from Estartit, a drive or train ride from Barcelona. \nEating there: Onion sauce fish soup is one specialty of Portal de Mar (Carrer Fatima 2, Torroella de Montgr√¨; +34 972761389) \nStaying there: Cal Tet Hotel features stone decor. \nMarisqueria Hotel Cal Tet | Santa Anna, 38, 17258 L'Estartit Spain Bozcaada (Turkey) \n\nThis island on Turkey's Aegean coast has been drawing them in for millennia. \nAccording to Homer's Iliad, it's where the Greek fleet hid waiting for Odysseus' signal to invade Troy. \nSixteenth century Ottoman ruler Suleiman the Magnificent also made his mark, building an overhanging fortress, circled by vineyards. \nFishermen, shepherds and soldiers were once the sole inhabitants, their legacy is a maze-like town filled with picturesque houses and fish taverns. \nSunsets at Polente lighthouse are a top attraction. \nGetting there: Flights connect from Istanbul to Canakkale.
