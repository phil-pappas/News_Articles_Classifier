Everything is home-made, from white chocolate and raspberry scones to rocky road cake, a layered Victoria sandwich and home-made Oreo cake. There was stilton and apricot quiche – the stilton is local – with a wonderful 5lb bucket-sized pork pie. The pie, made in the traditional Leicestershire style, includes pork belly, pork joint, smoked bacon, a pinch of nutmeg, fresh thyme, chilli powder and white pepper. There were venison sausages, doorstep sandwiches – the bloomer loaves baked at a local farm – pizza, puff pastry tart with goats cheese, basil and red and yellow peppers, and toad-in-the-hole venison sausage morsels and a marmalade chutney made by the club president’s mother-in-law. And huge teapots of Yorkshire Tea, of course. “When we know the ethnicity of some of the teams, we also cater for them with vegetarian or specific food,” explains Sancha, who has two sons playing for the club.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T15:02:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
