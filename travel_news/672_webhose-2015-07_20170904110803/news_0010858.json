During the first five months of 2015, Dubai International welcomed 32,384,620 passengers, compared to 29,608,364 passengers during the same period last year, an increase of 9.4 per cent.\nEastern Europe continued to be the fastest growing region in May up 85.4 per cent, driven mainly by flydubai’s new services to Slovakia, Bosnia, Bulgaria and Croatia, and Emirates service to Hungary and Transavia airline to Bulgaria. Other regions that registered high growth rates include the Indian subcontinent (33.8 per cent), GCC (31.1 per cent) and North America (28 per cent) – where Emirates has increased capacity on many destinations and launched a new route to Chicago.\nIn terms of total passenger numbers the Indian subcontinent outperformed the rest of the regions (+372,587 passengers), followed by the GCC (+248,919 passengers), and Western Europe (172,830).\nThe number of flights rose dramatically in May to 34,017, an increase of 48.8 per cent from 22,856 recorded during May 2014 due to the effect of the runway closure. Year to date flight movements reached 167,510, up 12.6 per cent from 148,784 aircraft movements recorded during the same period last year.\nDubai International freight volumes rose 15.5 percent in May to 216,712 tonnes compared to 187,688 tonnes in May 2014 as volumes were impacted by the runway programme. During the first five months of 2015 Dubai International has handled cargo totalled 1,015,482 tonnes of freight down 1.0 percent from 1,025,526 tonnes handled during the same period last year.\n“The summer peak is upon us and we are thrilled to have both of our upgraded runways in full operation,” said Paul Griffiths, CEO of Dubai Airports. “We expect record traffic levels and have boosted our staff levels, including our May I Help You personnel, to help passengers move as effortlessly as possible through the facility. We have also launched “Hang Out at DXB” which is a fun way to encourage passengers to arrive to the airport early to support on time operations and enjoy the wide array of dining, shopping and relaxation options we have on offer.”\nRelated Posts Dubai Airport Terminal 1 await bids from retailers!
