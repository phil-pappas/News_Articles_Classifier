The Willow Tea Rooms - A Step Back in Time \nI'm going to be straight with you. The Willow Tearooms is something of a tourist attraction. In fact, on their website they even boast of being one of the biggest tourist attractions in Glasgow. Go there anyway. \nJudging from the shopping bags and and the overheard conversations around me, plenty of locals go there too. And so should you - especially if you are interested in the work of architect and designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh. \nIn 1901, Mackintosh, who was already well established as an Art Nouveau designer (and who is to Glasgow what Gaudi is to Barcelona) was given full control of the redesign of 217 Sauchiehall Street. The owner, Kate Cranston commissioned him to redesign the building inside and out - exteriors, furnishings and fittings - down to the cutlery and teacups. \nWorking for Miss Cranston, Mackintosh experimented with and developed much of what is now known as the Glasgow Style. \nYou can see more examples of his work at the Kelvingrove Museum but, until his masterpiece, the Glasgow School of Art reopens in 2017 (it was badly damaged by fire in 2014), this is the closest you can get to being inside a Charles Rennie Mackintosh work of art. \nInsider Tip - The skylit and bright mezzanine at Sauchiehall Street, is a restoration of Mackintosh's original design. If you can, get a table in the Room Deluxe on the next floor up. This was the original Ladies Tea Room, decorated in lavender and silver. In its day, women would pay an extra penny to dine here. It is, today, almost entirely original. Go up another floor to what was the Billiards Room. There's a small museum and a pair of Mackintosh's original leaded stained glass Art Nouveau doors. And Don't Forget the Food \nThe menu is extensive - with more choice than you might expect in a tea room. There are sandwiches and salads, filled jacket potatoes (baked potatoes), a few Scottish specialities - smoked salmon, rarebit, haggis with neeps and tatties , Arbroath Smokies with cloutie dumplings - and a few surprises such as toasted brie and grape sandwich. \nFood is reasonably priced and served in generous portions. I just stopped in for a late afternoon snack of tea (from a selection of 29 black, green, red, white, herbal and fruit teas) and pie. My toffee apple tart was a juicy apple crumble topped with a centimeter thick layer of soft toffee fudge and it was truly amazing. The huge, sweet slab, together with a pot of Lapsang Souchong tea came to the princely sum of Â£6.50. Click here to see for yourself.
