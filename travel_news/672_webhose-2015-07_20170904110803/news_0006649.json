But it will arrive sooner than you expect – as will the all-important Ucas application deadline. For sixth formers, the emphasis on university applications starts before you even leave for the summer break. Just as you think you can kick back and relax, teachers will start to talk about your personal statement – there will probably even be assemblies and meetings dedicated to it. It’s strange how writing 4000 characters (spaces and punctuation included) can seem such a hard task. Getting started is often the biggest hurdle; having a blank Word document open in front of you can be incredibly demotivating, so get a draft written as soon as possible. Having 4000 characters that 'could use improvement' is better than a blank page devoid of any thoughts at all; at least you’ll have something to work with. Admittedly, for Oxbridge or medical courses, the need to focus is a little more urgent. The Ucas deadline of October 15 is approaching, and all elements of your application must be submitted by 6pm – this includes your personal statement, school reference, qualifications and payment. \"Having a blank Word document open in front of you can be incredibly demotivating, so get a draft written as soon as possible\" For other universities and courses, you will need to submit your application by January 15. However, as with most things in life, leaving your application to the last minute is not advisable. Schools will often set their own deadlines, to give teachers enough time to write references, so be sure to find out what this deadline is and, as closely as possible, stick to it. When it comes down to the nitty gritty of setting out why you are suited to a particular course, much will depend on where you are applying, and what you are applying to study, to how much space you dedicate to various aspects of the statement. For instance, Dr Sam Lucy, admissions tutor at Newham College, Cambridge, recently suggested that, in terms of mentioning extra-curricular activities and career related work experience, this wasn’t something Cambridge would be particularly interested in, “except where directly relevant to the course”. “Our admissions processes are focused on academic ability and potential,” she said. “So as long as applicants can show that they have 'spare capacity' in their lives (which could be for sport, or holding down part-time jobs), then we are quite happy.” Caitriona Woolhouse, head of student recruitment at the University of Oxford, has similar advice to give: “When advising students about applying to top universities in general, and specifically Oxford, we typically say that about 75-80 per cent should be related to your academic study and interest in the course and for 20-25 per cent to be related to non-academic life. “Extra-curricular activities, including work experience, are only considered in so far as they help demonstrate how you meet the selection criteria for your chosen course subject.” It’s important to bear in mind, however, that your UCAS personal statement will be seen by all the universities you have applied to, so, unless you plan on applying exclusively to Oxford or Cambridge, it would be wise to include points about your extra-curricular endeavours. Especially if you can link these to your chosen course. Regarding work experience, advice from Which? University suggests that prospective students should “focus on what you learned about the role, rather than the techniques you saw.” They also suggest that students should use extra-curricular activities and work placements to “demonstrate relevant qualities like resilience, problem-solving, leadership, teamwork, creativity and critical thinking”. However, they advise students to avoid giving out-of-date examples of interests by being selective about the most relevant, recent scenarios. Furthermore, sixth formers should be prepared to “substantiate and elaborate on anything said in a statement, at interview” – so don’t be tempted to boast about your extensive reading of Tolstoy, if you only managed to get through the first half of War and Peace. In terms of your academic achievements, think about why you are applying for the courses you have chosen – universities will want to see evidence that you know what’s required and that you’re enthusiastic about studying the topic. \"Think about why you are applying for the courses you have chosen – universities will want to see evidence that you know what’s required\" Make sure you look at the course requirements for each university you are applying to, and make reference to what is said in the prospectus. Showing you have done your research will help to highlight your commitment to the subject. Fatuma Mahad, director of operations at UCAS, also highlights the importance of proofreading your final copy. “Let friends and family read what you have written,” she says. “They may have suggestions you haven’t considered and can tell you whether it makes sense. “It’s also important to proofread it several times. Reading it out loud will help you to spot bad punctuation and messy wording.” The final key point to remember is possibly one of the most important. Don’t be tempted to copy anyone else’s work. The Copycatch system checks each statement against a vast library to find similarities. Although, recently, less than one per cent of statements needed to be flagged to institutions for similarity, it’s important not to plagiarise anyone else’s work. While writing your personal statement can seem like a weight around your neck, it’s your chance to show why you would be an asset to any higher education institution. Don’t ramble. Structure your points. Demonstrate why you will succeed on the course – rather than simply stating that you will – and don’t be afraid to stop before the 4000 characters are up.
