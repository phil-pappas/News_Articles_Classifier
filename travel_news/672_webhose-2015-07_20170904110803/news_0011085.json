Sign In Here A streamlined 8.5 percent hotel tax passed by City Council, not even two weeks ago, went into effect July 1 – in the midst of summer tourism and months before 1.5 million additional visitors come to Philadelphia. The bill is meant to regulate home sharing services, like Airbnb, an online service that lets guests rent out rooms and homes. Starting tomorrow, any host who rents to a guest for more than 90 days out of a year has to apply for a permit with the city. But, as part of the new law, hosts can’t rent out their homes for more than 180 days a year. This means that Philadelphia is the largest city in the United States to pass legislation to officially legalize the service. Home of the Day See All Homes of the Day The tax will not affect any guests who booked their lodgings prior to the July 1 start date. “By opening its doors to short-term home rentals, the city is allowing more guests, more local spending, and more taxes to flow into Philadelphia,” said Max Pomeranc , Airbnb’s regional head of public policy in a statement. Though it’s not clear how much revenue will be generated from the tax, there are more than 1,000 rentals available on the site with tourism experts expecting the service to grow in the upcoming months. “I think that we currently have a shortage of hotel rooms and bringing attention to rooms available from Airbnb is a good thing,” said Meryl Levitz , president and CEO of Visit Philadelphia who supported the bill. Levitz said the city has between 11,000 and 15,000 hotel rooms. She also said the service will benefit smaller neighborhoods like Fishtown or Northern Liberties where there aren’t hotel options. “It’s nice to have them available while we’re waiting for more hotels to be built,” she added. Philadelphia’s tourism industry is going strong with almost 40 million visitors last year that spent about $30 million a day, according to a recent report by Visit Philadelphia. City Councilman William Greenlee introduced and sponsored the bill on May 7, and it was passed before Council’s summer recess. “This legislation will benefit the city, Philadelphians and visitors who want to partake in upcoming events like the Pope’s visit and the Democratic National Convention which will bring millions to Philadelphia,” Greenlee said in a statement made available through Airbnb. “I’m glad I could work with Airbnb and the Nutter Administration to enable people to share their homes.” CLOSER LOOK Airbnb stats An economic impact report released by Airbnb shows: Nationally, 74 percent of the homes or rooms rented through Airbnb are outside of major hotel districts and 42 percent of guest spending happens around the neighborhoods where they’re staying. Statistics also show that Airbnb guests are more likely to stay longer and spend more. Though numbers for Philadelphia aren’t available through Airbnb’s economic impact report, it does show that New York City guests that stayed in the service’s rentals between 2012-13 generated about $632 million in economic activity in a day. In a smaller city like Boston, guests generated $51 million in economic impact between 2013 and 2014. \nWant Philadelphia Travel  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T14:30:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
