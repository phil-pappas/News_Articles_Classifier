It is the third most visited country in the world, with approximately 60.6 million arrivals, a figure that continues to increase thanks primarily to a surge in visitors from emerging markets such as China, Brazil and Mexico.\nSpain boasts top marks for its cultural resources, and also scores highly for business travelers with a significant number of international conferences.\nIt has a high ranking (4th) on online searches for entertainment—restaurants, nightlife and attractions—as well as prioritization of the travel & tourism industry (6th) and tourism service infrastructure (4th).\nHowever, there is room for improvement. The low rank for business environment (100th) reflects red tape related to construction permits and an inefficient legal framework, while the labour market is still assessed as somewhat rigid (113th) and sees a mismatch between workers’ rewards and productivity (125th).\nFirst compiled in 2007, the Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) measures “the set of factors and policies that enable the sustainable development of the Travel & Tourism sector, which in turn, contributes to the development and competitiveness of a country”.\nThe index has been developed in the context of the World Economic Forum’s Industry Partnership Programme for Aviation & Travel.\nRelated Posts TripAdvisor touches mark of 100 million downloads for free app for iPhone and Android ‘Earn While you Learn’ Programme – India Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium China, Russia prime drivers of global tourism New VisitScotland data reveals regional visitor trends for 2012", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T05:20:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
