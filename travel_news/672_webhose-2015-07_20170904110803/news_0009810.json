Or, at the very least, ludicrously unlucky. On Tuesday, the abandoned Ski Village site was found to be on fire. And this isn't the first time the slope has been alight; far from it. The Ski Village was left derelict in 2012 after an accidental fire destroyed the main building. In the years that followed, three further fires, all ruled to be started deliberately, served to worsen the condition of the neglected slope. Sheffield residents expressed their disbelief (or comical lack thereof) that the Ski Village was once more ablaze on Twitter, often accompanied by pictures of thick black smoke billowing from the site. Here are 10 of the best responses: Sheffield Ski Village. Why are you always on fire?! All the time I've known you, you've been on fire. Are you made of twigs and petrol?! — Russell Clarke (@Ruvio) July 21, 2015 Aww it's the annual Sheffield Ski Village fire. Making me nostalgic for South Yorkshire.. https://t.co/76rRpEFVHj — Joe Oliver (@joe_oliver) July 21, 2015 The Sheffield Ski Village quarterly fire has begun. #skivillage pic.twitter.com/LQmbbyzUga — Martin Spencer (@rhythm_bound) July 21, 2015 I'm beginning to think Sheffield Ski Village is actually a volcano in disguise — Drenge (@drenge) July 21, 2015 Sheffield Ski village, sorry, Pile of Ash, is somehow once again on fire. Surely this defies physics, chemistry etc. pic.twitter.com/a4uTMSCcf9 — Gav Richards (@gav) July 21, 2015 #Sheffield Ski Village on fire again. Didn't think there was anything left to burn... #sheffieldissuper pic.twitter.com/tlGyLrr6oe — David Fox-Meakin ? (@Meaks) July 21, 2015 You know, it should be reported when #Sheffield Ski Village ISN'T on fire. This must be the 4th time it has been alight — Ant B (@MitsubishiEvo6) July 21, 2015 Sounds like the Sheffield Ski Village is ablaze, AGAIN. Scientists need to get down there, find out what this never-ending fuel source is. — Andy (@Mr_Andy_Johnson) July 21, 2015 Red sky at night, #Sheffield Ski Village is on fire again. — Kenny HM (@kennycarwash) July 21, 2015 And, our personal favourite: .Sheffield Ski Village is the inanimate object equivalent of this https://t.co/ul9sbUDVzG @ForgePress — James Kenny (@JamesyKenny) July 21, 2015 Many of Team GB's top freestyle athletes first learnt to ski or snowboard at the Ski Village, including James \"Woodsy\" Woods, Katie Summerhayes and Jamie Nicholls. In June, some local freeskiers attempted to remind Sheffield of the facility's former glory by making a video where they used the derelict slope to perform flips and tricks .
