He told them that they are old colleagues who have been a part of the anti-graft movement.\n“Kejriwal also briefed Anna about the work he has done in the past months — initiatives like the Aam Aadmi canteen, mobile clinic and the anti-graft work undertaken by the Delhi government,” a source close to Hazare said.\nBefore the meeting, Hazare had told reporters that he would ask Kejriwal about the expulsion of the two former AAP members, besides raising the issue of not appointing a Lokpal.\n“We told Anna ji about the good work done by the Delhi government. We also briefed him about the work done by the Anti-Corruption Branch and how the Centre is creating impediments in its functioning,” Sisodia said.\nWhen asked about the appointment of Lokpal in Delhi, he said, “The Lokpal bill will be brought in the next session.”\nBhushan and Yadav were expelled from the party in April for “anti-party” activities after they questioned the party leadership and functioning within the organisation.\nBhushan, along with his father Shanti, was part of the core committee of Hazare’s Janlokpal movement.\n 26, 2015 11:33 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T07:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T22:10:58.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
