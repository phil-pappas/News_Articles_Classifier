Whether in Ecuador or Peru, I had family accompanying me, and plenty of excitement waiting in the rainforest. \nMy son and I visited the Napo Wildlife Centre in Ecuador for our Amazonian adventure. This is accessed via a 30-minute flight from Quito , Ecuador’s capital, to Coca, where we were picked up in a high-speed motorized canoe that took us to a tributary of the Amazon, at which point we were met by our two guides. \nThe final leg of the journey to Napo was by non-motorized canoe, upon which we were more than happy to join in the paddling for the 45-minute trip to the wildlife centre. This was our first experience of the wonderful sounds and sights of the Amazon, and we were greeted by a cacophony of noise courtesy of a group of the wellnamed howler monkey. The next morning, we quickly learned why the Amazon rainforest was so named as we awoke to an absolutely torrential downpour. We were scheduled to paddle back up the tributary and go on a hike through the rainforest itself. The rains just added to the experience and it helped that Napo equipped us with heavy-duty ponchos and rubber boots. \nThe hike through the rainforest was outstanding – just the two of us with our guides, one of them leading the way armed with a machete to clear the route. While we encountered many different forms of wildlife on the hike, the only disconcerting one for me was when we came across a group of bullet ants – allegedly so named because if you get bitten by one it is apparently akin to having been shot! \nThe weather for the balance of our stay was hot and humid, and on one of our other hikes with our two guides we were joined by another group of four travellers. We were all walking single file down a trail with my son behind me at the back of the group and the last guide behind him. My son stopped, and I heard him ask the guide: “Is that snake poisonous?” He was pointing to a small snake curled up on the trail that we had all miraculously avoided. Turns out he was a viper and, yes, quite poisonous. \nAnother highlight was a trip to a parrot clay lick, where hundreds of parakeets slowly descend to the bottom of a ravine to lick the mineral contained in the soil. This is a lengthy process as the parakeets are concerned about the potential presence of predators and gradually work their way down. After about 45 minutes, they all made it down and were enjoying their spoils when one spotted a hawk circling above and they flew off en masse right through where we were standing – quite the sight. \nNEXT, PERU – AND PIRANHAS \nMy next trip to the Amazon was in Peru with my wife. We joined Aqua Expeditions on their 24-passenger boat to cruise down the Amazon. \nOne of our favourite highlights was stopping to fish for piranha. There were so many and the chicken bait was quite appealing to them, so my wife was able to snag one within five minutes (all were released). \nOur guides assured us it was perfectly safe to swim in the river despite it being infested with piranha. So, of course, we did. It’s a very strange sensation as you can feel them brushing against you. While in the water we also witnessed a pod of beautiful pink dolphins. Quite the experience. \nWe made plenty of stops on land and particularly enjoyed going to a native village and seeing all the kids playing soccer. We also enjoyed a hike into the forest where we came across tarantulas and an anaconda together with a number of very bright but quite poisonous tree frogs. Another highlight was a night trip down a tributary in a smaller canoe where we encountered caimans (easy to spot by their eyes, which are red when caught in the glare of a flashlight). If you’re not comfortable being around spiders and snakes, the Amazon might not be for you. \nIf, on the other hand, you’re not fazed by any of that, it is a fabulous experience and one I am very glad to have enjoyed. © Copyright (c) Postmedia Network Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T20:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T01:26:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
