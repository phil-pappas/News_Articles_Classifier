A newly opened exhibition features the best of one of Denmark’s most internationally renowned designers, Henrik Vibskov. To limit Vibskov only to fashion design would not be quite right, as he dabbles in music and art as well—while also being the owner of a coffee shop. His fashion shows probably describe him best, as he is known for his use of iconoclastic shock tactics to create unique presentations, drawing attention and controversy in equal measure with each new collection. This exhibit features more than 300 works, including a re-created set design from one his shows and design highlights from many of his collections.\nHenrik Vibskov—Fabricate will be on view until December 31 at the Daelim Museum, Seoul.\nFor more information, visit www.henrikvibskov.com .", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php"], "published": "2015-07-16T02:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T00:31:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
