It can be a tough slog in a day, especially in the snow, which can stick around until late June despite warm weather. A great place to break your journey to Thórsmörk is the Baldursskali volcano hut. It’s in an isolated spot, so most days you’ll only see couple of wardens, their dog an half a dozen walkers. If tackling nearby Laugavegurinn trail, book overnight huts through the Icelandic Touring Association .\nDorm from £34, advance booking advised, volcanohuts.com\nBrightey\nL’Alivi, Corsica The gite d-etape “L’Alivi” is in the tiny village of Serriera on the fantastic six-day Mare e Monti (Nord) trail in Corsica. You’ll find a good bed in a rustic stone building that was once the village’s olive press and mill, and the food here was some of the best we had in Corsica. We ate herb tart, wild-boar lasagne and a local cheese, served with homemade fig preserve. Breakfasts are no less generous and there are packed lunches (€7), too.\nDorm from €18, doubles/private dorm also available, alivi.fr\nbryfox\nAstrakas refuge, Greece Facebook Twitter Pinterest “We prefer the traditional ways”, said the refuge manager. “Anyway, it’s cheaper. We can’t afford helicopter supplies!” We were staying in the Astrakas refuge, nearly 2,000 metres high (and powered by solar panels), in the mountains of northern Greece. It is open from May to October, serves food and has simple dorms and cold showers. Enjoy the peaks and tarns of Mount Gamila and take the well-marked paths to the Dragon Lake, or to the Vikos gorge and cobbled tracks of the Zagoria. Bed from €13, astrakarefuge.com\nJaneSLaurie\nPolish mountain shelter In between crystal-clear lakes and encircled by the jagged peaks of the Tatra mountains is the Polish Tourist Society mountain shelter. This is the only lodge in the national park that can’t be reached by car and makes the perfect spot to break your trek. Refuel with a bowl of zurek , a hearty soup of sausage, onion and potatoes, before taking an evening stroll to see the wildflowers or the Siklawa waterfall.\nDorm from £7 a night, piecstawow.pl\nRachel Thorley\nCasa Vita B&B, Tuscany, Italy A wonderful rural place on the Via Francigena, an old pilgrim route from Cantebury to Rome .
