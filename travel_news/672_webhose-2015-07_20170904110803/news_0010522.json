Department of Transportation has awarded two Raleigh construction companies multimillion-dollar contracts to do highway repair work in the Triangle. Fred Smith Co. has landed a $3.8 million contract to do milling, resurfacing and shoulder work on 9.6 miles of roadway in Wake County. The work will involve repairs to portions of U.S. 70 near Garner and on sections of U.S. 401 near the Harnett County line. The work is expected to close or narrow lanes on both highways as work proceeds, though NCDOT isn’t allowing lane changes during rush-hour periods.
