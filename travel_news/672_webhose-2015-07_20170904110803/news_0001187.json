But the company’s 50% growth year on year over the past five years proves the sound strategic thinking behind this industry innovation.\nLast week, at a gala dinner held at Prince Albert Hall in London attended by thousands of business leaders from across the world, the company was awarded the Prince of Wales Unilever Global Development Award for Business in the Community, acknowledging its contribution to social development.\nIt began with a conversation over coffee. Beerman and Dr Avron Urison met in 2002 and discussed the dismal HIV/AIDS situation in SA and the fact that 17% of SA’s employed adult population infected with HIV were unable to access life cover.\nThis meant they were less likely to buy a house, start a business or get an education. For the working class, this could mean a steady slide into poverty.\n\"Working in private equity for a while meant it was my habit to keep an eye out for commercial opportunities. I believe entrepreneurs should look at the spaces in which people specifically think there are no opportunities,\" he says. \"Urison and I realised there was a real need for an insurance product for a manageable, chronic disease like HIV/AIDS. We began to talk about how it might be possible to deliver to that need.\"\n...\nBEERMAN and Dr Urison are MBA graduates of the University of Cape Town’s Graduate School of Business, which Beerman says had a large influence on his ability to change career paths from engineering to investment banking.\nHe had a stint with a US investment bank, then worked in private equity in SA. Dr Urison had been a medical doctor, was CEO of MRI SA and worked as a healthcare business consultant with a focus on HIV/AIDS. They were later joined by a UCT graduate out of McKinsey and Company, Paul Stanley. The trio’s track record allowed them to interact with investors. The hurdle was convincing investors their business strategy was a result of sound business judgment and that they intended offering a full-profit insurance product to a high-risk clientele.\n\"Everyone thought we were insane,\" Beerman says. \"We had to fight against industry norms that drove most of the behaviours in the industry at the time. The message to potential clients up until then had been that HIV-positive people were not expected to live long enough for insurers to make a profit. We began to tell clients that they could manage their health correctly, live a very long life and have the opportunity to undertake long-term projects.\"\n...\nSINCE AllLife began in 2004, its clients have committed to regular medical visits and treatment protocols. The company has agreements with medical providers and computer systems to track clients’ medical improvements (a key cost driver). Reminders of blood tests and doctor visits are sent out, and staff members speak to every client once a month. Systems were created to deliver these features at low cost to a mass market.\nAllLife clients average a 15% improvement in their CD4 count (an immune system marker) six months after being insured, whether or not they take antiretrovirals. AllLife gets applications from people living with HIV/AIDS in the US, Europe and Asia who can’t access life insurance.\n\"We’re operating in an emerging market using first-world infrastructure to deliver our business model. We’ve even had to change the standard insurance industry distribution model – AllLife sells directly to HIV-positive clients because intermediaries just weren’t comfortable discussing the issues with them,\" Beerman says.\nAllLife offers a similar product for people living with diabetes, as this chronic disease requires a similar management process to HIV/AIDS.\n...\nHE explains: \"If you’re an Average Joe, you can buy a suit anywhere, but if your size is non-standard you have to go through a bespoke, time-consuming, tailored process. In insurance this means medical tests, screening, committing the time and effort to showing a track record of managing your disease in order to get insurance. We’re the big-and-tall store, where diabetic and HIV-positive people can get a mass retail experience otherwise denied them. This means clients can get cover when they want and need it, which makes us dramatically different …\"\nSA is an emerging market finding its feet in a fast-changing global economic environment, with more than its fair share of challenges. But this environment offers opportunities to those willing to innovate, he says.\n\"Absenteeism in SA has risen tenfold in two decades, due largely to the impact of HIV/AIDS on individuals’ health. The rate of absenteeism organisations face — higher than their competitors elsewhere in the world — has a significant impact on productivity.\n\"A negative, yes, but also an opportunity for AllLife to take an innovative product to market that minimises the impact of HIV/ AIDS on an individual’s ability to earn, by helping them to manage their disease and stay as healthy as possible.\n\"We have a massive market to grow into. We can reach far more people, but the rate at which we grow will depend partly on the amount of capital we are able to raise.\"\nThis remains AllLife’s greatest challenge. As a direct marketer, the company uses television, the internet and mobile technology to advertise its services. This generates leads and leads become paying clients, but first the company must fund its high marketing costs; in order to do this, it will need access to capital.\nBeerman believes that SA offers both obstacles and possible boons to its entrepreneurs. \"It’s a tough market in which to be an entrepreneur. Capital is difficult to access and industries can be highly regulated. But if you get your innovation past these challenges, you’ll likely find yourself in a space all of your own with competitors trailing far behind.\"\n• This article first appeared in GSB Business Review, published by the University of Cape Town Graduate School of Business", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T09:24:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
