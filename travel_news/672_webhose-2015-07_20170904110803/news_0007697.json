Our guide features expert recommendations for city , beach , villa , culture , food and drink and activity holidays. All prices are for property rental for a week in spring or summer unless stated otherwise. They are subject to availability. 1. Podere Palazzo, Lazio Tuscany , Umbria and Lazio meet in a landscape of wild beauty, where boars and porcupines roam free in the Monte Rufeno regional park and views stretch for miles towards lofty Monte Amiata. Just inside Lazio, this stylish five-bedroom villa was renovated by the Chicago-based Italian architect Patrizio Fradiani in 2007. It’s a well-judged mix of old and new, with tasteful modern furnishings and fittings playing off against the terracotta floors, wooden beams and old stone walls. The heated infinity pool has stunning views – and there’s an organic vegetable garden as well as olive and fruit orchard tenants are welcome to raid for dinner. Nearby are the hot springs of San Casciano dei Bagni, while the village of Trevinano – which can be seen across the valley – has two great restaurants, one (La Parolina) a fancy Michelin-starred place, the other (Gianfranco) a good downhome trattoria. This villa has a heated infinity pool with fantastic views From £3,100 (00 1 773 425 5730; poderepalazzo.com ). Lee Marshall 2. Historic Syracuse There are plenty of luxury villas within driving distance of Siracusa (Syracuse), but for couples or small family groups who want to combine culture with la dolce vita and can live without a pool, the award-winning rental company Think Sicily has two delightful sea-view apartments inside Ortigia, the historic city’s once-shabby but now increasingly chic centro storico. There’s not much to choose between the properties, Archimede and Ortigia: both feature stylish décor and spacious roof terraces with endless views out across the Ionian Sea. From £1,887 Archimede (sleeps six); from £2,240 Ortigia (sleeps six) (020 7377 8518; thethinkingtraveller.com ). LM 3. Borgo di Vagli, Tuscany Not so much a villa as a village, Borgo di Vagli is a hamlet of 14th-century houses, expertly renovated but gloriously lost in time. Just getting there will help you shake off the 21st century – quite literally, as the bumpy final 2km of unpaved approach road are a serious challenge. In this hilltop fastness the internet seems an anachronism, with wooded mountains as far as the eye can see: in the restaurant kitchen, the cook is floury to her elbows, while the vegetable garden yields wonderful produce for the table. But a landscaped terrace has two pools for sun-worshipping, and the rustic simplicity of the 21 self-catering houses conceals a wealth of up-to-the minute facilities. For guests who can handle the road, pretty Cortona is nearby, and the historic towns of Tuscany and Umbria are conveniently close. From £805 through Traditional Tuscany (0800 975 5379; traditionaltuscany.co.uk ). LM 4. Villa Levanto, Liguria On the western edge of the Cinque Terre – that string of near-vertical Ligurian villages beloved of walkers – Levanto is a characterful, cultured seaside town with a long sandy beach. It’s perfect for families keen to combine gentle coastal walks – made more accessible thanks to frequent, cheap trains that link the town with all five Cinque Terre villages – with some bucket-and-spade time for the kids. Up above the town, but only a 15-minute walk from the beach, pretty, ochre-washed Villa Levanto would work well for a group of friends or two medium-sized family groups. Think of it as a country villa near the beach. Between June and September, weekly rental varies From £4,550 through Bridgewater’s Idyllic Italy (0161 787 8587; bridgewatertravel.co.uk ). LM 5. Villa La Quiete, Lake Como For a once-in-a-lifetime holiday, you could do worse than this magnificent 18th-century villa in Tremezzo on the western shore of Lake Como, frescoed and stuccoed to the hilt and surrounded by formal gardens that descend to your own private landing stage. Once owned by Duke Gian Galeazzo Serbelloni, an Italian supporter of Napoleon, the villa is a living museum, with trompe-l’oeil artworks by two pupils of Tiepolo and a historic weaponry collection among its many treasures. There are six luminous double bedrooms done out with true antique noblesse oblige. And if the rental seems steep, bear in mind that it includes your own private butler and chef. It makes George Clooney’s place down the road look positively shabby. From £19,000 through Bellini Travel (020 7602 7602; bellinitravel.com ). LM 6. DIY Marche Monastero di Favari is a restored 17th-century monastery Sometimes it’s worth looking beyond the villa rental companies – especially in areas like Le Marche, which are patchily covered by most of the usual Italy specialists. Cut-out-the-middleman websites like Owners Direct ( ownersdirect.co.uk ) and Airbnb ( airbnb.com ) offer a degree of anti-scam protection and allow you to check out reviews left by previous tenants. Among the well-liked Owners Direct properties in Le Marche is the Monastero di Favari (search for “Villa in Apiro”) – a sensitively restored 17th-century monastery, owned by an Anglo-Italian couple, that sleeps up to 15. On Airbnb, home in on the area just to the north of Urbino and among the first results you’ll see a lovely old farmhouse near the village of Mondaino, which sleeps seven, restored and decorated in romantic bohemian style by an English artist couple, Phelan and Susan Harlock-Black. Monastero di Favari from £1,740; Mondaino from £475, including Airbnb service fee. LM 7. Palazzo dei Leoni, Lake Orta Less well known than Como or Maggiore, Lake Orta is a mysterious place, of contemplative hamlets and mists that shroud picturesque San Giulio island. Set in the village of Vacciago, the recently renovated eight-bed Palazzo dei Leoni is a historic townhouse where decorated coffered ceilings and antique marble fireplaces blend with a minimalist design pared back though anything but neutral. From its pretty garden-courtyard, complete with dining area, through its sleek kitchen to its top-floor bedrooms with superb lake views, this is an exceptionally sophisticated village retreat. From £3,640 (00 39 335 571 6654; palazzodeileoni.it ). LM 8. Villa Dolce Vita, Venice When you’ve explored all Venice ’s alleyways and sampled its plush hotels, where do you go next? Out into the hugely atmospheric lagoon is one option, and to savour it to the full, a holiday home in a watery setting is essential. The owner-renter site HomeAway offers an intriguing selection. Facing Venice-wards near Treporti, the four-person Villa Dolce Vita is a stylish contemporary makeover of an old casone – a rural estate house used for fishing and hunting trips. As well as high-tech gadgetry, a salt-water swimming lake and manicured lawns running down to the water, it has its own mooring stage. Larger still – sleeping 15 – is the Villa San Giovanni, on a private island off Torcello; there’s a pool, extensive gardens, a cook and a private boat service. The garden and pool of Villa San Giovanni Villa Dolce Vita from £320 per night; Villa San Giovanni from £962 per night ( homeaway.co.uk ). LM 9. Golfo di Orosei, Sardinia On Sardinia ’s mountainous east coast, some 90km south of Olbia, the Golfo di Orosei has an appealing mix of craggy cliffs and pine-shaded beaches. With no major town on this stretch of coast, there is instead a sprinkling of low-key resorts well-placed for some of the island’s best swimming. Most places are within reach of the inland centre of Orosei, an atmospheric old town of grey and black basalt interwoven by a medieval skein of alleys dotted with handsome churches and palazzi, not to mention some excellent and reasonably priced restaurants. HomeAway has a selection of properties to rent on the coast, including Casa Siccas, a modern, spacious, recently renovated two-bedroom apartment with a terrace, 50 metres from the sea at Località Sas Linnas Siccas. From £840 ( homeaway.co.uk ). Rob Andrews 10. Casa del Conte, Umbria Umbria has no shortage of pretty pastoral countryside, so the key to a villa holiday is to find a location that is also convenient for exploring the region’s dozen or more hill towns. The Italian specialist Real Holidays has a small but well-chosen selection of properties close to several towns, including some apartment and agriturismo options. A favourite is Casa del Conte, a five-bedoom house with private pool (and ruined medieval tower), sleeping up to 10, that dates back to the 17th century. It is in a pretty rural setting, overlooking the Tiber Valley, but just 10 minutes’ drive from Todi, one of the most compelling of the region’s smaller towns. If you visit in the last 10 days of August, look out for the acclaimed Todi Festival ( todifestival.it ), a wide-ranging arts event that celebrates its 29th year in 2015. From £4,075 (020 7359 3938; realholidays.co.uk ).
