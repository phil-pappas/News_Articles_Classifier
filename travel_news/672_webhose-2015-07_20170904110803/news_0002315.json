Yellow Cab operator Pittsburgh Transportation Group is looking to expand the way it's moving people around Pittsburgh, according to president and CEO Jamie Campolongo . That could include pedicabs, not just its signature taxis. \"You could see Yellow Cab pedicabs in Pittsburgh in the future, why not,\" said Campolongo. \"We have a big garage, a lot of customers, and if drivers prefer to pedal, we're fine with that.\" In the past, looking at options like electric pedal cabs would have been out of the question, he said as the company, like so many others in the taxi industry, remained focused on its core competencies. But things are changing, thanks in large part to increased competition. Home of the Day See All Homes of the Day Last year, when ride-share startups Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. hit the road in Pittsburgh it was a wakeup call for traditional transportation providers. These companies didn't have to play by the same rules and were quickly taking away customers, and even drivers. When the services first came to town, Yellow Cab was down an average of 12 driver shifts per day. \"We have had migration, and have a lot of drivers that drive for Yellow Cab and one of the ride-shares, but we're adapting,\" Campolongo said. \"We're back on a growth curve.\" In an effort to better battle ride-share services, in April Yellow Cab Pittsburgh launched its own ride-hailing app and ridesharing service , known as Yellow Z. The service is currently going through the application process to expand service to Pittsburgh International Airport, he said. \"It's just giving customers another option,\" he said. And despite Uber's decision earlier this week to lower its fares by 15 percent in Pittsburgh , Campolongo said he doesn't expect it to have much impact on his business. \"Their fares when you factor in all the fees aren't that far below us,\" he said. \"I think the biggest positive for us is that they have effectively given all of their drivers a 15 percent pay cut and we didn't.\" Also, with taxis and Yellow Z riders don't have to worry about surge pricing, which charges riders a higher fee during peak times, he added. \"If you lower your rate 15 percent, but still do surge pricing where people are paying three times the standard rate, what does it really matter,\" he said. Despite the moves being made by the new ride-providing players in town, Campolongo said he doesn't see it eroding traditional taxi service, but it is important to adapt. \"We're not who we were back then,\" Campolongo said. \"We're getting much better at being flexible.\" \nWant Pittsburgh Travel news in your inbox?
