The area offers family activities based on hiking, fruit collecting and swimming in lakes.

The coastal path to Vela Blanca is closed to all but foot traffic, and provides astounding views as you clamber along the track with jagged rocks, coral reefs and abundant wildlife.\nbcb567\nCaminito del Rey, Málaga Tourists walk the El Caminito del Rey, built in 1905 through the Gaitanes Gorge. Photograph: Kiko Jim nez/Kiko Jim nez/Demotix/Corbis The renovated Caminito del Rey in the province of Málaga is sometimes dubbed “ the world’s most dangerous path ”. The 3km walkway clings to the Garganta del Chorro ravine, and traces the route of the original decayed catwalk from which several walkers fell to their deaths. The new metre-wide, wood-panelled walkway features several spectacular glass floor sections and a hanging bridge over the gorge.\ncaminitodelrey.info\nContentedTraveller\nSpaghetti western landscapes The stunning Tabernas desert, Almería.

The location is superb, we rode as a group from the farmhouse each day and soon got to know everyone. Jenny and Tim were excellent hosts and quickly gauged the group to ensure we rode within our limits on the most enjoyable trails.\npuremountains.com\nAndrew Larkin\nWhite Villages bike tour From Ronda, try the Andalucían Cycling Experience tour, with farmhouse/hotel accommodation and a support van.

The question is really how much can you do with a baby in tow? We – one experienced biker, one less experienced (and pregnant) and one 18-month-old with a bicycle trailer – had a great holiday arranged by Sierra Cycling, in Fuengirola. Top-quality riding for those who wanted it, including some dramatic river crossings, and lovely less-technical off-road with great views, as far as Africa on one day. I can honestly say this is the first holiday in 18 months I’ve really felt revitalised by.\nThree nights, four days’ riding from €240pp, day trips €70, sierracycling.com\nmarygill68", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrolean_traverse", "http://www.sierracycling.com/", "http://www.rockclimbingcompany.co.uk/Via_Ferrata_in_Southern_Spain.html", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Activity+holidays+in+Andaluc%C3%ADa%3A+readers%E2%80%99+travel+tips&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Fjul%2F23%2Fandalucia-activity-holidays-readers-travel-tips-malaga-spain&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F7%2F22%2F1437579309592%2Ff75519a6-0735-4e9a-822f-7462994f53a6-2060x1373.jpeg", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Activity+holidays+in+Andaluc%C3%ADa%3A+readers%E2%80%99+travel+tips&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Fjul%2F23%2Fandalucia-activity-holidays-readers-travel-tips-malaga-spain&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F7%2F22%2F1437580320451%2F77cc186e-8591-423f-bcfe-3dc95d28244f-2060x1095.jpeg", "http://www.eljardindelossuenos.es/", "http://www.andaluciancyclingexperience.com/Tours/White_Village_tours.html", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4aqea%2Fsfb%23img-3&ref=responsive", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4aqea%2Fsfb%23img-4&ref=responsive", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Activity+holidays+in+Andaluc%C3%ADa%3A+readers%E2%80%99+travel+tips&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4aqea%2Fstw%23img-3", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Activity+holidays+in+Andaluc%C3%ADa%3A+readers%E2%80%99+travel+tips&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4aqea%2Fstw%23img-2", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Activity+holidays+in+Andaluc%C3%ADa%3A+readers%E2%80%99+travel+tips&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4aqea%2Fstw%23img-5", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Activity+holidays+in+Andaluc%C3%ADa%3A+readers%E2%80%99+travel+tips&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4aqea%2Fstw%23img-4", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4aqea%2Fsfb%23img-5&ref=responsive", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Activity+holidays+in+Andaluc%C3%ADa%3A+readers%E2%80%99+travel+tips&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4aqea%2Fstw%23img-6", "http://www.walkalpujarra.com/self-led-walking-holidays/gr7-self-led", "http://www.paddleinspain.com/white-water-rafting-in-m%C3%A1laga-act-225.php", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Activity+holidays+in+Andaluc%C3%ADa%3A+readers%E2%80%99+travel+tips&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Fjul%2F23%2Fandalucia-activity-holidays-readers-travel-tips-malaga-spain&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F7%2F22%2F1437579771051%2Fc9cbb12c-ba52-43c9-96a9-2a4873d4aac8-2060x1352.jpeg", "http://www.inntravel.co.uk/holidays/walking-holidays/Spain/Andalucia/Dramatic-Landscapes-of-Almeria?tab=prices", "http://www.caminitodelrey.info/en/#1", "http://www.puremountains.com/holidays/general-and-booking-info", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Activity+holidays+in+Andaluc%C3%ADa%3A+readers%E2%80%99+travel+tips&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Fjul%2F23%2Fandalucia-activity-holidays-readers-travel-tips-malaga-spain&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F7%2F22%2F1437580572488%2F095a4fe5-b9e4-4a9b-b8ff-93a8d9204722-1020x765.jpeg", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4aqea%2Fsfb%23img-6&ref=responsive", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Activity+holidays+in+Andaluc%C3%ADa%3A+readers%E2%80%99+travel+tips&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Fjul%2F23%2Fandalucia-activity-holidays-readers-travel-tips-malaga-spain&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F7%2F22%2F1437580017779%2Fdfeec066-1646-4440-b6c9-9c2123048bd0-2060x1375.jpeg", "http://www.mountainbikeworldwide.com/bike-tours/spain", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4aqea%2Fsfb%23img-2&ref=responsive"], "published": "2015-07-23T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T16:07:14.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
