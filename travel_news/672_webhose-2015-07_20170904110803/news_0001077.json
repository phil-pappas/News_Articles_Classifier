It was a totally cliched, very real insecure breakdown moment, when I was like, ‘I f***ing hate myself’,” Stewart has told Marie Claire magazine.

Source: News Corp Australia\nStewart says she was just like any normal angsty teenager and really struggled under the microscope of fame.\n“Between ages 15 and 20, it was really intense. I was constantly anxious. I was kind of a control freak. If I didn’t know how something was going to turn out, I would make myself ill, or just be locked up or inhibited in a way that was really debilitating,” she tells the glossy mag.\nHowever, the 25 year old insists maturity has helped her deal with her emotions and it has even ignited a fierceness in her. “At one point, you just let go and give yourself to your life. I have finally managed that and I get so much more out of life. I’ve lived hard for such a young person, and I’ve done that to myself - but I’ve come out the other end not hardened but strong.” Kristen Stewart and Emile Hirsch in a scene from 2007 film 'Into The Wild'.

But I wouldn’t trade it, to be honest. I’m really proud that I am able to move forward and not fall into every mental crater. That’s a new thing for me. Age has made me smarter and calmer. And it is f***ing awesome.” In the telling interview, Stewart also addressed public criticisms she has faced following her public romance and breakup with her Twilight co-star Robert Pattinson. “I lit my universe on fire and I watched it burn. Speaking very candidly, it was a really traumatic period in my early twenties that kickstarted something in me that was a bit more ... feral. “The public kind of burned me at the stake. But that’s OK, I can take it. I’m not dead.”\nWe’ve got a brand new 60 inch Sony Bravia TV to give away thanks to Fox’s Movie Of The Day app !
