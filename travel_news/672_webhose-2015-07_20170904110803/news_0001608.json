The journey concludes in the industrial city of Chongjin, almost on the border with Russia. \n\n\n\nTravel to this part of North Korea has been tightly restricted in the past and anyone wanting to visit the north-east was previously required to take a special charter flight. \n\nCities such as Sinpho and Kimchaek are also along the route and are as-yet unexplored by foreign tourists, Koryo Tours said. \n\nThe inaugural trip, scheduled for October 2, will cost around US$3,220. \n\nThe period of the tour also coincides with Party Foundation Day, one of the most important days on North Korea's calendar, marking the founding of the Workers' Party. Participants will be able to watch march-pasts by the military, firework displays and mass dances. \n\nKoryo Tours also states there is a chance to \"mingle with the locals\" during the celebrations. \n\nNick Bonner, the British founder of Koryo Tours, said he has high hopes that tourism will have a positive impact on North Korea's relations with countries and people from outside its borders, adding that he sees the company's efforts \"as a form of diplomacy\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T13:52:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
