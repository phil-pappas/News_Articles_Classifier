The two have teamed up to offer visitors’ tours of the bedmaker’s workshop followed by afternoon tea in the Savoy’s glass-domed lounge, known as the Thames Foyer. Beds for the Savoy are made by hand using materials like horsetail hair, Mongolian cashmere and British lamb’s wool. The tour lasts about 90 minutes, during which visitors will meet the artisans and learn about their techniques. Visitors then proceed to the Savoy to enjoy the hotel’s traditional tea with scones, clotted cream, sandwiches and dessert. The tour is £140 (about $215) per person, including car transportation in central London.
