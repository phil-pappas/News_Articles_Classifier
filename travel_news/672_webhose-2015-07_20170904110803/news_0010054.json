Whether near or far, big or small, food festivals are a perfect reason to get friends together for cooking demonstrations, wine tastings, gala dinners, and other food-nerd activities you’d otherwise not get a chance to participate in. Plus, they can be a fun way of checking out a new part of the country with all its regional chefs and like-minded food lovers concentrated around one event.\nSo we did it again, this time checking out festivals in late February and early March that have great value deals on airfare, hotel rooms, or both. All of these are subject to change depending on availability and where you’re departing from, but these are all great deals we’d book ourselves.\nSouth Beach Food and Wine Festival : Feb. 23-26\n© Startraks Photo/REX Shutterstock 2011 Food Network South Beach Wine and Food Festival, Miami Beach, Florida, America - 25 Feb 2011 This festival is one of Florida’s most anticipated food events of the year.
