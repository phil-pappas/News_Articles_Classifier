(AP) -- An iconic image of motherhood is making a visit to Massachusetts. The painting known as \"Whistler's Mother\" is on display at the Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, part of an exhibition featuring the works of James McNeill Whistler. The 1871 painting is one of the most renowned works of art by an American. It has been owned by the French state since 1891 and is in the Musee d'Orsay's collection in Paris. The Clark Institute is one of only two American venues featuring the painting this year. It was previously at the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, California. The painting depicts Anna McNeill Whistler dressed in black mourning garb and a white cotton cap, sitting in profile. It will be on display at the Clark Institute through Sept. 27.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T16:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T17:21:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
