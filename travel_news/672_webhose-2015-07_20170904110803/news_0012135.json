Photographer's Note \nFrom Logan, the highest road point in Glacier NP, there is a great walk through the snow to Hidden Lake with plenty of mountain goats and mating marmots along the way. These young goats were high on a colourful rockface. Taken with a Pentax 2.8 50-135mm lens with a 1.4 extension. Copyright 2015 Ian Fegent.
