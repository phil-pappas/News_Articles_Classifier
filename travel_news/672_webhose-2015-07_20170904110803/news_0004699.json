To the world, it is an important UNESCO Heritage site and a world biosphere reserve that boasts an impressive collection of flora and fauna. \nTo the locals, Sinharaja is a place of legends and mysticism. The name Sinharaja locally means \"royal\", so many historians suggest that the Sinharaja is hailed as the \"king forest\" by the Sinhalese people. In terms of folklore, people believe that the forest was the home of the legendary Sri Lankan lion king. The reserve is currently managed by the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources of Sri Lanka. \nLocated in Sri Lanka's northwest corner, Sinharaja is about 40 kilometers from Galle, and is marked by the Gin Ganga (river) flowing into its southern section. Despite its importance, the reserve is not as frequently visited as other sites in Sri Lanka. It has remained largely undisturbed and is, therefore, a great alternative destination for the adventurous and persistent traveler. \nThe park can be accessed through three routes which are Kudawa (northwest), Pitadeniya (south) and Morningside (east). The most used among the three is the Kudawa entrance. This route has decent roads and provides convenient access to wonderful walking trails. If you intend to use public transport to reach Kudawa, you will need to take multiple buses within an approximately 4-hour stretch. \nKudawa is a small village about half a mile from the northern entrance of the reserve. To reach this entrance, your only option is walk slightly uphill. You need to pay a minimum fee of Rs. 500 to gain entrance. If you plan to thoroughly explore the forest, it is recommended that you hire a guide from Weddagala or Kudawa. \nSinharaja is a dream destination for any nature lover. It is home to more than 60 percent of the country's rare and endemic trees as well as a large population of butterflies and mammals. It is adorned with mountains, waterfalls, streams and springs. There is plenty of opportunities in the area for ultimate nature-oriented excursions. From the village of Kudawa, there are three prominent nature trails to choose from - Mulawella, Wathurawa and Sinhagala. \nVisiting Sinharaja also gives you the chance to see some of the 22 villages that surround the forest. There are about 5000 people who live in these villages. The villages of Kolonthotuwa and Warukandeniya, in particular, are located within the reserve. The villagers live peacefully keeping their traditions and culture. Aside from agriculture, they make baskets and mats made from rattan. So if you feel like bringing home some souvenirs from your trip, these handmade items are the perfect candidates. \nStaying overnight near the pristine forest reserve takes your experience to the next level. There are a couple of established eco lodges that cater to guests. One of them is the Martin's Lodge, which offers quality bird-watching experiences. The lodge is only a five minute stroll from the park's entrance and is run by renowned ornithologists. Other nearby accommodation options include the Boulder Gardens, Blue Magpie and Rainforest Edge. Aside from the lodges, you can also opt to stay at the Kudawa camp, also managed by the Forest Department.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T16:23:26.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
