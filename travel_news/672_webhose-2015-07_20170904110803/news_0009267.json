Canton, North and Portofino at The Venetian® Macao and Conrad Macao’s signature restaurant Dynasty 8 at Sands® Cotai Central received accolades at the annual awards that recognise the best wine lists in China.\nCanton, The Venetian Macao’s signature Cantonese restaurant, was awarded “Three Wine Glasses” for its impressive wine list which works well with a broad spectrum of Chinese dishes. While Portofino, North and Dynasty 8 each received “Two Wine Glasses”.\n“We are very pleased that our wine lists have once again been recognised by the China Wine List Awards,” said Charles Newland, Senior Vice President of Food and Beverage and Director of Paiza Operations for Venetian Macau Limited. “We take great pride in offering our guests the best possible service we can, and that includes having wine lists that are as diverse as they are extensive. These awards are testament to our continuing efforts to this end.”\nThe Wine List of the Year Awards were originally established by Tucker Seabrook in Australia in 1994 and are now the premier national awards for wine lists in that country. In 2011, the Wine List of the Year Awards founder was asked by representatives from China’s hospitality and tourism Industry and the government to bring the Wine List of the Year Awards to China. They were launched the following year at the 2012 China Sommelier Competition in Shanghai.\nRelated Posts China’s railways record 231 million holiday trips Dubai Airport Terminal 1 await bids from retailers!
