American Airlines chose to put this system on every single one of the deicers they purchased. They also chose our Global Air Plus system, where you can actually deice the aircraft with a stream of compressed air that comes out at 750 miles per hour. That dramatically reduces the time and the quantity of chemicals used on the aircraft.” The telemetry system was first offered for commercial use last year. But the American Airlines order itself is five times more than all the telemetry systems they sold to date. Global Ground Support also developed an operating system that allows the entire truck to be driven from the boom, and an in-truck blending system mixes the glycol used for deicing with water — based on the air temperature — to reduce the chemical use. “We’ve seen a big market expansion because of these new technologies we built in-house,” Walsh said. “That’s exciting to see.” Also supporting Global Ground Support’s growth is six-year deal with the U.S. Air Force worth $38 million, that was awarded a year ago. So it's a nice foundation to add to all the company's new growth. Global Ground Support has about 60 employees but is adding more to help meet all the new demand. \nWant Dallas Travel news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
