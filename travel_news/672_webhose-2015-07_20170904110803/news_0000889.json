Patience helps too. That’s the approach Robin McKee uses to unleash the massive story book that is Hamilton Cemetery , sitting high on a bluff overlooking Hamilton Harbour . \nEach Saturday morning dozens of enthusiasts follow McKee through the cemetery to hear him interpret somebody’s unique story hinted at by a few words chiseled into granite or marble – like William Winer Cooke, the scion of a prominent Hamilton pharmaceutical family. \n“GAR” is written at the top of his tombstone. It stands for Grand Army of the Republic; President Lincoln’s army during the American Civil War. But it’s not an official stone issued by the U.S. Army; it was designed by his family. It gives Cooke the rank of Colonel, but he was more of a close friend of General George Custer than he was a commissioned officer. \nHe rode along with Custer’s cavalry during the Civil War, and after the war Custer twice came to Hamilton to visit with Cooke’s wealthy family, McKee tells us. \nCuster asked his friend if he would like to join him on a little exploratory venture into the west. It’ll be a nice ride, Custer assured Cooke. And it would have been had they not encountered Lakota leader Crazy Horse and his assembled tribes on the Little Bighorn River in Montana . In an armed clash Custer, Cooke and 268 members of the 7th Cavalry were killed by Crazy Horse and his war party. Crazy Horse fled to Canada knowing revenge was coming. \nCooke and Custer and the dead cavalry soldiers were buried on the battlefield, but Cooke’s mother wanted him returned home, so she headed out to Montana and dug up various graves on the battlefield until she found her son. He is now at rest in Hamilton Cemetery . \nThe U.S. Army exhumed Custer’s body too and reburied him at West Point Military Academy on the Hudson River in New York. His men are still buried on the battlefield. \nMore than just the stones of Hamilton Cemetery reveal Canada’s history. So too do the rolling hills and berms on the cemetery grounds. Before this was a cemetery and before Hamilton even existed, a British fort named Burlington Heights stood here. The soldiers in this fort may have turned the tide in Canada’s favour during the War of 1812 . They felt greatly outnumbered by the approaching Americans who had already captured Fort George on the Niagara River, so they sneaked out of Burlington Heights at midnight on June 5, 1813 and attacked a large American force encamped a few miles further south at Stoney Creek. \nHistorians believe the Battle of Stoney Creek was the decisive battle that stopped all American advances into Upper Canada. McKee can not only help you envision the British fort surrounded by today’s tombstones, but can also tell you about the individual trickery by non-combatant locals who helped the British sneak past the American outposts. \nHe can show you the grave stone of George Hamilton, the man who created Hamilton and named it for himself. Although born in Niagara, Hamilton earned a good education in Scotland and became a wealthy businessman. And shrewd too. \nHe was a captain in the Niagara Light Dragoons when they captured Detroit. He figured at the end of the war the government of Upper Canada would be reluctant to establish important government administration offices in Niagara near those pesky Americans, but the west end of Lake Ontario looked promising, so he bought 250 acres on Burlington Bay, which eventually grew into the City of Hamilton with a census Metropolitan area population today of 720,000 souls, plus Angelo Mosca. \nIt’s just his stone however points out McKee. His body is on the family farm, which today is a public park. \nOne of his cleverest acts as mayor was to cut the Burlington Ship Canal that connects Hamilton Harbour to Lake Ontario and worldwide shipping. \nMuch of Canada’s history can be found on the stones in Hamilton Cemetery and McKee knows every story – such as that of Nelson Stevens. \nStevens was a slave who followed the Underground Railway from the Southern U.S. to freedom in Canada. But he chose to head back into the United States when the American Civil War erupted to serve in the U.S. Army. Stevens survived the war and returned to Canada to live a long life. When he died he was buried in an unmarked grave. When McKee learned his story he was determined to find that unmarked grave – and he did. Today Stevens has a headstone issued by the U.S. Army which denotes his rank of corporal and that he served in the “United States Colored Troops” (USCT). \nAnother large tombstone bears a carving of an old-fashion steam locomotive. Buried beneath that stone are many of the 60 victims of one of Ontario’s greatest rail disasters. A passenger train out of Toronto bound for Hamilton and on to Niagara Falls in March, 1857 came crashing through the 60-foot-high railway trestle over the Desjardin Canal that connects Coots Paradise to Hamilton Harbour. Only 30 of the 90 passengers survived. One of the victims on board was Samuel Zimmerman, the man who had the trestle built. McKee can tell you how that accident investigation was corrupted. \nMore details about Robin McKee and his weekly cemetery tours and weekly themes can be obtained from his website, hamiltonhistory.ca .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T18:32:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
