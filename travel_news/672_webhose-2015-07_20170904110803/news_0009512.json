Site preparation and demolition work began in June at the 3110 Olentangy River Road site for a 240-room full-service Marriott Hotel and a 114-room Residence Inn being developed by Columbus-based Continental Real Estate Cos. and Concord Hospitality Enterprises Co. of North Carolina. The dual-branded property, a first for the Marriott chain , is expected to be ready late next year. The project cost is about $50 million. Continental President David Kass told me the Olentangy River Road lodging market has lacked a branded, full-service hotel. He cited expansions of OSU’s Wexner Medical Center and Riverside Methodist Hospital as supporting the need for the Residence Inn, the extended-stay brand of the Marriott International family of hotels that will offer travelers a mix of studio, one- and two-bedroom suites. The Marriott will offer 12,000 square feet of meeting space and the hotels will share some amenities including a pool, 2,000-square-foot fitness center and exterior courtyards. “This (lodging) corridor is getting very strong,” he said. Kass said the back guest-room portion of the shuttered University Plaza will get built into the Marriott. “It’s getting gutted and renovated,” he said. Concord and Continental bought the property a year ago from a joint venture of Columbus developers Indus Hotels and Core Real Estate Capital, which had planned a full-service Marriott on the site but failed to secure financing. Continental and Concord received a city environmental grant in support of the site redevelopment effort in May. \nWant Columbus Travel   Related Content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T21:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T21:48:35.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
