Earlier in July, we announced the approval of ORKAMBI, and many of you joined for that call. Tonight, we will be focused on second-quarter performance and our execution against our corporate strategy. Joining me on tonight's call are Dr. Jeff Leiden, Chairman and CEO; Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Commercial Officer; and Ian Smith, Chief Financial Officer. Jeff Chodakewitz, our Chief Medical Officer, is traveling, and is not with us tonight. Our agenda tonight is as follows: Jeff will begin by discussing key priorities for our business. Stuart will review the second-quarter performance of KALYDECO and make a few comments on the ORKAMBI launch, and to close, Ian will review the second-quarter 2015 financial results and update our 2015 guidance. You can access the webcast slides by going for the events section of the Investor Relations page on our website. I will remind you that we will make forward-looking statements on this conference call. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today's press release and our 10-K, which has been (technical issue) without limitation those regarding the ongoing development and potential commercialization of ORKAMBI, those about Vertex's other cystic fibrosis programs, and Vertex's future financial performance are based on management's current assumptions. Actual outcomes and events could differ materially. Information regarding our use of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is available in our second-quarter 2015 financial results press release. I would also refer you to slide 4 of tonight's webcast. I will now turn the call over to Dr. Jeff Leiden. Jeff Leiden (Chairman, CEO): Thanks, Michael. Good evening, everyone. The approval of ORKAMBI on July 2 was an important milestone in our shared journey with the cystic fibrosis community. ORKAMBI is the first FDA-approved medicine to treat the underlying cause of CF for the approximately 8,500 people in the US 12 years and older with two copies of the F508del mutation. This is a big step forward toward our long-term vision of helping more people with CF. We feel very fortunate to be part of the CF community, and we appreciate all of the positive feedback we have received and continue to receive from patients, caregivers, healthcare providers, and the broader CF community. At the beginning of this year, we outlined three strategic priorities that will allow Vertex to continue to deliver on our vision to make new transformative medicines available to patients globally. Let me briefly review our progress toward meeting those goals. First, through both geographic and label expansion, we have continued to grow the number of patients treated with KALYDECO, resulting in strong revenue growth. With the ORKAMBI approval and launch in the US, we have an even greater opportunity to treat more patients, resulting in additional revenue growth. Second, we know that there is still much more to do. We continue to make significant investment into multiple programs to create more CF medicines that may enable us to treat even more patients, and to improve the benefit for the patients we treat. All four studies included in the VX-661 plus ivacaftor pivotal Phase III development program are initiated, and we also remain on track to bring a next-generation CFTR corrector into the clinic by the end of 2015. And third, we have expanded and diversified our pipeline through our collaboration with Parion to develop and commercialize investigational epithelial sodium channel, or ENaC inhibitors, for CF and other pulmonary diseases. We also continue to advance early stage development programs outside of CF, including clinical programs in oncology, and research programs focused on other areas. We look forward to updating you on these programs later this year. 1 of 12", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T17:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T17:35:55.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
