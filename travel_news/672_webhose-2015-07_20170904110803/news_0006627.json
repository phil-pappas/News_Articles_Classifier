Go to an occupied theatre The Embros theatre in central Athens has been a “cultural open space” since 2012. Catch a show by the Stray Bitches – a feminist theatre group who, when not on stage, can be found touring the streets, giving out anti-fascist propaganda.\nRelated: Want to help Greece? Go there on holiday\n2. Eat fish, surrounded by wild horses Tarsanas, a beach restaurant in Lavrio , 60km south-east of Athens, takes Greek informality to new levels. Dimitris, who runs it, will serve you – if he likes you – barefoot. His horses sometimes wander between the tables. The crab comes with spicy sauce, in which it is compulsory to douse your chips, and the mussels are cooked in ouzo.\n3. Take your own graffiti tour of Exarchia Exarchia is the bohemian district sporadically under anarchist control which, despite the occasional tense moment, remains the beating heart of young Athens . The restaurants along Ippokratous are good and – for foreigners – cheap. Don’t take your camera unless you want to understand how unpopular the media is. On a really busy night there will be doorstep parties, dance events in the park on Strefi hill and, depending what happens in politics, the occasional whiff of tear gas.\n4. Go to the Meet Market The Meet Market is a two-day event that involves new Greek designers and brands, including handmade jewellery and clothes. It happens once a month in different places around Athens, and usually has live music and street food.\n5. Go back to the 1950s Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ikaria, Greece. Photograph: Eirini Vourloumis There is no island sleepier than Ikaria. Twelve hours by boat from Piraeas, in the eastern Aegean, the island’s culture has remained profoundly analogue. The residents don’t wear watches and live on Ikarian time, partying after midnight until 10am, while winemaking or doing their PhDs in what little daylight they actually are awake for. It is the Exarchia of the islands.\n6. Feed migrants There are numerous local initiatives in the big cities, with ad hoc groups springing up to help out the 60,000 people who have crossed from Turkey this year. Klimaka , an NGO in Gazi, Athens, feeds, clothes and provides medicine to homeless Greeks and recent migrants.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A rescue operation in April off Rhodes, Greece, to rescue migrants in the Aegean Sea.

Visit a British battlefield In 1942, 12 British commandos parachuted into central Greece to sabotage the railway viaduct at Gorgopotamos, a strategic supply route for German troops fighting in north Africa. It was a spectacular success and marked the beginning of the Special Operations Executive’s [a British spy agency] collaboration with the communist resistance. The picturesque villages nearby include tiny Pyrsogianni, where there is a history museum commemorating the secret language of the peasants who lived there; the secret pathways they relied on provide some rugged hiking if you feel like reliving the yomp done by the men of Operation Harling.", "external_links": ["http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Anarchist+theatre+and+wild+horses%3A+how+to+have+a+Greek+solidarity+holiday&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2015%2Fjul%2F07%2Fgreek-solidarity-holiday-anarchist-theatre-wild-horses-paul-mason&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F7%2F7%2F1436289378076%2F074028aa-3e56-4d78-8480-52ed78e3b40d-2060x1236.jpeg", "http://www.embros.gr/", "http://www.klimaka.org.gr/", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Anarchist+theatre+and+wild+horses%3A+how+to+have+a+Greek+solidarity+holiday&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2015%2Fjul%2F07%2Fgreek-solidarity-holiday-anarchist-theatre-wild-horses-paul-mason&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F7%2F7%2F1436287678105%2F9127dc7d-5fab-41b0-8246-cffaf18d3f6c-2060x1236.jpeg", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4aejt%2Fsfb%23img-2&ref=responsive", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Meet-Market/241235502675042", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Anarchist+theatre+and+wild+horses%3A+how+to+have+a+Greek+solidarity+holiday&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4aejt%2Fstw%23img-2", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Anarchist+theatre+and+wild+horses%3A+how+to+have+a+Greek+solidarity+holiday&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4aejt%2Fstw%23img-3", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4aejt%2Fsfb%23img-3&ref=responsive", "https://www.facebook.com/tarsanasfishrestaurant", "http://adespoteskyles.blogspot.gr/?m=1"], "published": "2015-07-08T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T00:43:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
