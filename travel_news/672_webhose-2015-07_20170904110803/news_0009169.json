Back in 1979, my family went on a road trip to the Black Hills of South Dakota and along the way we stopped in the Badlands. Then, as today, the Black Hills was a big tourist destination. I remember walking around the colorful rock structures and watching prairie dogs. \nOne thing many people don’t realize is that the colorful bands you see in the rocks actually has a connection to another park: Yellowstone . Much of the rock is ash from ancient volcanic eruptions from Yellowstone which settled over the area. \nVisiting Badlands is pretty easy to do if you are in the region. The park lies just off Interstate-90 outside of Wall, SD. If you see signs for Wall Drug anywhere in the world, just follow them and you’ll find the Badlands.
