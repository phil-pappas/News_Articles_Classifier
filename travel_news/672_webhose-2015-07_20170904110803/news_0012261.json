It’s no surprise, with its rich heritage and history, while also being regarded as a top spot for golf and for recharging on its beautiful beaches. As such, there are just as many reasons to hang out at the fantastic array of all-inclusive resorts as there are to jump in a local taxi or tour bus and discover everything else this lush destination has to offer.\nFive Reasons to Stay On Your Resort:\n1. Spa-ahhh . Most resorts offer high-end spas for pampering after a hard day on the beach. Try out a couples treatment, a beachside massage, or just a relaxing steam and hot tub. A quiet mini-getaway (from the kids, or maybe each other) without stepping outside the resort.\n2. Move it! Stay or get active with on-site sports and activities. Most resorts have a complete gym with scheduled classes, water sports and more. Water sports can include sailing, kayaking, windsurfing, snorkeling, scuba diving and more. Kids clubs are often included and help to get the kids active in child-friendly ways…giving Mom and Dad more time to get active themselves, or book that extra spa treatment.\n3. Fore, Play! The island is famous for its stunning golf courses, but you don’t have to leave the resort to find a world-class round. The five-star adults only Iberostar Grand Hotel Bávaro offers golf packages included in your stay.\n4. Indulge! All inclusives have upped their game and the variety and quality of the food available is usually on level with the rating of the resort itself. Often a higher end restaurant can be accessed with a modest upgrade fee as well. Alcoholic drinks are also included and plentiful. A quick walk home from across the resort beats driving home any day.\n5. Bend It! Long known for its “Circus” feature (flying trapeze), Club Med in Punta Cana has just launched its new “Creactive” feature, in partnership with world-renowned Cirque du Soleil. Guests have the opportunity to learn and play with real Cirque artists in this unique and all-inclusive activity.\nFive Reasons to Get Off The Resort:\n1. Zip It! Experienced guides lead you on extensive canopy zip line courses, from platform to platform as you glide above the trees. Some tours can be as long as four hours, with multiple platforms and challenges along the way. Can be a terrific way to view the Dominican Republic's Oriental Mountain Range.\n2. Eat Local . Get off the resort to try some authentic, freshly picked and prepared food at local restaurants. Most dishes include white rice and stewed beans; when served with meat its called La Bandera. Mangu, a dish made of mashed plantains and red onions, is also popular. Satisfy your sweet tooth with a dulce de coco, a coconut and milk dessert.\n3. Hike It Up! The Dominican Republic is full of picturesque hikes of all different levels and lengths to suit the beginner to the expert hiker. Take it up a notch and tackle the Pico Duarte, the highest mountain in the Caribbean. Tours with guides (who provide your food) are available.\n4. Tour It Up! Most resorts will be able to organize daylong off-site excursions to visit local towns for a chance to meet the friendly Dominican people. The Iberostar Hacienda Dominicus offers a trip to visit the small fishing town of Bayahibe, with a Catamaran sail to Saona Island. Once on the island, you’ll enjoy music, entertainment, activities, food, drinks, crystal clear waters and beautiful beaches make for a gorgeous one-day getaway.\n5. Make History. The capital city of Santo Domingo was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1992, and is the site of Christopher Columbus’ first European settlement in the Americas. This is a city of many firsts in the New World with the first cathedral, paved road, university, hospital, stone home, fortress and tavern. Home to almost three million, this is also the largest city in the Dominican Republic.\nKathy Buckworth can be heard on SiriusXM Canada “What She Said,” with “How She Travels.”\n ", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T22:00:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
