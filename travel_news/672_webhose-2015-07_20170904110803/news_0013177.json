Jefferson City, MO - infoZine - If you’re thinking about driving impaired this week, the red, white and blue flashing lights of your Independence Day holiday may be those of a patrol car – and the view of the fireworks is not so good from a local jail cell. The Fourth of July is one of the deadliest holidays of the year due to substance-impaired driving crashes. Local law enforcement will be out in full force July 3-5 seeking impaired drivers through increased sobriety checkpoints, roving and saturation patrols, and other enforcement methods. There are no warnings and no excuses. If you drive impaired you will be arrested. Don’t risk losing your independence by choosing to drink and drive. Trooper talking with motorist.

Violators risk killing or harming others, face jail time, the loss of their driver licenses, higher insurance rates and dozens of other unanticipated expenses from attorney fees, fines and court costs, car towing and repairs, and lost time at work. The Missouri Coalition for Roadway Safety recommends these simple tips to avoid a drunk-driving disaster: Before drinking, designate a sober driver. If you’re impaired, use a taxi, call a sober friend or family member, or use public transportation so you are sure to get home safely. If you happen to see a drunk driver on the road, don’t hesitate to call local law enforcement. Always wear your seat belt. It’s your best defense in any traffic crash.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T15:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T23:44:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
