New, original series such as the time-travel fantasy Outlander and the business drama Power , which is executive produced by musician Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson, have helped elevate Starz's profile among viewers and critics. \nAnd with roughly 23.7 million subscribers, Englewood, Colo.-based Starz has moved into the No. 2 slot among premium TV networks, surpassing CBS's ( CBS ) Showtime in late 2014, according to data compiled by SNL Kagan. \n\"Starz has an original programming strategy that appears to be working well,\" said Evercore ISI analyst David Joyce, who estimates that Starz added about 100,000 new subscribers during the second quarter. \nMust Read: 5 Big Dividend Stocks Billionaire John Paulson Loves \nBut among such highlights, the company's results come at what may be a crucial time for the network given that its partnership with Disney ( DIS ) is due to terminate at year's end. That partnership has given Starz access to a large library of films. Beginning in 2016, Netflix ( NFLX ) will take over the exclusive U.S. pay-TV rights to Disney movies, including the rights to films from Pixar and the Marvel superhero franchises. \nThe loss of Disney content will leave Starz with just Sony ( SNE ) as a movie provider. \nTo bridge the gap, Starz may be headed to a merger with Lions Gate Entertainment ( LGF ) given the closer alliance forged when Liberty Media ( LMCA ) Chairman John Malone sold a 4.5% stake in Starz to Lions Gate in exchange for a 3.4% position in the movie and television studio. The maneuver was widely viewed as a precursor to tying up Starz with the Epix network, which is part owned by Lionsgate. \n\"The studio content from the Epix partners could help fill the near-term programming void for Starz once Disney leaves,\" said Ben Mogil, media analyst with Stifel. Mogil added that such a move would also ease the pressure on Starz to quickly find new, original programs to complete its programming lineup. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T00:46:05.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
