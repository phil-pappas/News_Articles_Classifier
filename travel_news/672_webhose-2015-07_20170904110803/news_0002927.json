It also has provisions to fight discrimination against individuals or groups on the basis of religion, caste, doctrine, race, color or ethnic origin. \nThe law, however, encourages anyone involved in any activity that violates the law to voluntarily submit themselves before the authorities and has provisions allowing the courts to waive penalties in such cases. \nThe law condemns actions that comprise hate speech or the promotion of discrimination or violence against others using any form of media, including online, print, radio or visual media. \nStrict action \nStrict action will be taken against any form of expression of hatred or incitement to hate crimes spread in the form of speech and published media. \nThe law also criminalizes any act that amounts to abuse of religion or vandalism of religious rituals, holy sites or symbols, and takes a serious view of violence on the basis of religious doctrines. \nThe law prohibits any entity or group established specifically to provoke religious hatred and recommends stringent punishments for groups or supporters of any organizations or individuals that are associated with hate crimes. It also bars any kind of events such as conferences and meetings within the UAE organized with the sole purpose of sowing seeds of discrimination, discord or hatred against individuals or groups on the basis of faith, origin or race. Receiving financial support for such activities is also punishable under the new law. \nThe new law does not contradict any other existing laws meant to protect specially privileged groups in the society such as women, children and individuals with disabilities or others. \nDr Theodore Karasik, a UAE-based geopolitical analyst, said the UAE is a moderate, advanced, peace-loving nation where its inhabitants practice cosmopolitanism. \n“This new anti-hate law serves as a model for the rest of the world at a time when hate is spreading across the region and the globe,” Dr Karasik said. “It is necessary and innovative as it halts the etiology of cultural, racial and religious differences.” \nDr Karasik stressed the UAE anti-hate law is well-timed and far-reaching. \nEnforcing tolerance \n“Not only does the new law enforce tolerance on those who harbor hate but also puts the UAE ahead of any other country in the world in terms of stifling anger over ‘those who may be different’ through stereotypes. There is no space in the UAE for this type of behavior because the phenomena is counterproductive, hurtful, and demeaning,” he told Gulf News. \nDr Karasik said other countries suffer daily from hatred which can take many forms, either through violence, voice, or cyberspace in terms of cyber-bullying and posts on social media. \nThe law, he said, brings the concept of social security to a new level that protects everyone in the UAE. \n“The proliferation of hate groups is testimony to the trend accompanied by a lackluster response in key countries to fight this scourge,” Dr Karasik said. “Hate is a driver of social destruction not only in terms of race and ethnic relations, but also between religions. Hate is intense, long-lasting, and demands retaliation or redress. Hate, in other words, clouds reason. Clearly, hatred leads to extremism which manifests itself across a broad spectrum of belief systems and cultures. But the UAE inhabitants don’t have time for this type of discourse. Besides, it’s shameful,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T07:00:36.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
