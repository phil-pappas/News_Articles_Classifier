About half way between Cuba and mainland Florida, This historic, national treasure is a bit off the beaten path at the far tip of the Florida National Marine Sanctuary. It’s waiting to be discovered by the intrepid traveler. A tiny, isolated U.S. National Park, the Dry Tortugas are in fact “dry” due to having no fresh water. They became “las tortugas” after Ponce De Leon paid a visit in 1513 and was inspired by the hundreds of sea turtles he saw. I boarded the Yankee Freedom III, the National Park Service (NPS) ferry, from the Key West Seaport at 100 Grinnell Street. The 6am call was a bit early for me, but the friendly captain Rick Gauron and his crew stowed my kayak, camping equipment and enough food and water for the maximum three-night stay.The trip takes 2.5 hours and delivers about 200 people each day to Garden Key, the second largest of the seven islands. Day-trippers have about four hours to explore, swim and lounge on the beautiful white-sand beach. The crew provides a breakfast and lunch buffet and snorkel equipment for all visitors.As you approach by private boat, seaplane or the Yankee Freedom ferry, the majestic Fort Jefferson stands in stark contrast to the blue water. It took 16 million red bricks to create this massive, three-story hexagon, built to stand watch over the gateway to the southern United States in the early 1800s. For the adventurous traveler, four hours isn’t enough time to discover this magnificent place. There are 10 camping permits available from the NPS on a first come/first served basis. I was lucky enough to snag a permit and thus my adventure was set into motion. I selected one of the few shaded spots on the island to set up my tent and get my camping gear situated. While there are no bugs or mosquitos on the island (one of the benefits of having no fresh water) you should be prepared to share your campsite with hermit crabs. Don’t worry – they’re not much of a nuisance and you soon get used to the little clicking sound they make while crawling around the base of the Buttonwood trees. Exploring Fort Jefferson was the first order of business. I crossed the bridge over the moat hoping to catch a glimpse of the resident saltwater crocodile I’d heard about or a wayward sea turtle. The fort is simply massive with a large grass area surrounded by the largest masonry structure in the Americas. I visited the many hidden rooms and artifacts throughout the site, including the jail cell of Samuel Mudd, the physician who helped John Wilkes Booth after he assassinated President Abraham Lincoln. Visitors on the NPS ferry can take a 40-minute guided tour of Fort Jefferson or explore on their own. Once inside the stone and wood gate you will discover winding staircases, cannons, soldier barracks and brick archways that navigate endless hallways. The building once held 420 heavy guns to guard against pirates and other intruders into U.S. waters.When the Yankee Freedom ferry pulls away from the dock around 3pm, the true magic of the Dry Tortugas unfolds. As the sun goes down, a soft quiet fills the air and one-by-one the sky is illuminated by millions of stars. I must admit I wimped out when a few of my fellow campers set out for a night snorkel. Maybe it was the eight-foot nurse shark I had seen earlier that day from the high wall inside the fort (telling them about it might have spoiled their fun). Still, the beautiful evening was perfect and I felt blissfully comfortable in my temporary home. The next morning I packed the kayak with enough food, water and supplies for the three-mile paddle across the rough, open channel to Loggerhead Key (the largest of the islands). I pulled my kayak onto the beach and wandered up to the lighthouse where I met two young women who were monitoring sea turtle nests as interns for the Student Conservation Association. They led me across the narrow island to the calm, north side and pointed out “Little Africa” a patch of coral with great snorkeling right off the beach. The Dry Tortugas is the crown jewel at the far tip of the Great Florida Reef, the third largest barrier reef in the world, where the water is as clear and lovely as the Caribbean Sea. The shipwrecks and reefs are a Mecca for scuba divers, fishermen and scientists who return each year to study the ecology and significant corals. Some of these sites are marked with white buoys where you can tie up your kayak or boat and explore below the surface. The area remains a biological hot spot, even though in the last two decades the Florida reef has lost 50 percent of all its living coral. Elevated water temperatures, more intense hurricanes, and increased acidity all play a role in the decline of the reef.Garden Key is connected by a spit of sand to Bush Key and a protected rookery where you may see thousands of Sooty or Brown Noddy Terns and Frigatebirds with their massive wingspan. The rookery is closed during nesting season but you can explore by kayak. Be careful not to get too close – they will dive-bomb your boat to protect their nests.The Dry Tortugas islands are about 100 miles off Cuba, and during my short visit, there were two boats of Cuban refugees who made landfall. They had packed between 17 and 30 people into tiny vessels called “chugs” stocked with only plastic containers of water and a few personal possessions. A woman in the campground was fluent in Spanish and was asked by the NPS to translate for the refugees. She later told me some of their stories. For one man it was his 15th attempt to make the crossing, each time he was sent back to Cuba to face punishment. One family had made it together – a mother, father and teenage daughter. One family was torn apart – a father had made the trip, but he left his wife and young son behind. The translator quoted him: “We all would have made it if they had come with me.” I wondered how bad things must be in Cuba to make these people risk their lives during a three-day open water crossing in nothing more than a bathtub made from welded sheet metal with a makeshift rudder and an old car engine to propel it across the open sea. Not long after the Cubans arrived in the Tortugas, they were whisked away by the Coast Guard where their long journey to claim political asylum and assimilate into the United States would begin. Their smiling faces conveyed just how they felt. My final day in the Dry Tortugas was spent snorkeling around the giant, exterior wall of Fort Jefferson and between the old pilings where a large dock once stood. There is no shortage of sea life to behold, including schools of barracuda, parrotfish, tarpon, grouper and thousands of tropical fish. I felt a pang of regret as I packed up my gear and boarded the Yankee Freedom to make the return trip with the rest of the 200 visitors. I enjoyed a fresh-water shower and a cold beer (from the ferry’s open bar) on the last leg of my journey. The National Park Service ranger waved goodbye as we pulled away from the dock and I watched the beautiful architecture of Fort Jefferson disappear into the blue water.
