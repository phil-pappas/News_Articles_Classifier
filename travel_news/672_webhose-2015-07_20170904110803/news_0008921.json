I have a few queries regarding the trip After going through Aarosh's Bharatpur trip report, I have made few edits to the original queries. Few are answered but I still need some suggestions. This is the plan : Leave at 5 am on Wednesday 29th July (tomorrow) Take route Dwarka -> Gurgaon -> Sohna -> Palwal -> Kosi Kalan -> Kaman -> Deeg How the road conditions are between Gurgaon -> Sohna -> Palwal ? Or should I take Dwarka -> Gurgaon -> Sohna -> Nuh -> Punhana -> Kaman -> Deeg ? It's shorter but I am not sure about the road conditions. Reach Deeg by 8:30 am and go straight to the Fort What is the entry/opening time for this fort ? Leave Deeg by 10:30-11:00 am to Bharatpur and Reach there by 11:30 - 12:00 in the afternoon Stay at Bharatpur near Lohagarh Fort Any cheap hotels with parking facility close by ? Around 4:00 pm visit Lohagarh Fort and visit local markets if possible Night stay at Bharatpur.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T07:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T10:51:26.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
