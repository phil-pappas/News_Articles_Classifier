Anne", "locations": ["Southesk", "Alberta"], "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": ["Anne", "James Carnegie"], "text": "Next month 159 years ago James Carnegie the 9th Earl of Southesk — who may have been Alberta’s first outdoors tourist — found himself in the missionary position. \nOr in his own words, “amidst the odors and sights of free nature.” \nThe Earl left Liverpool on April 15, 1859 on a Cunard paddle-wheeler called the “Africa” heading for “some part of the world where good sport could be met.” \nBut only after pulling a few strings with Hudson’s Bay Company governor Sir George Simpson. \nBecause what’s the point of being a member of the Scottish aristocracy if you can’t cash in. \nThe plan was to head west out of Fort Garry hunting bears and bison until he reached Fort Edmonton on Aug. 11 where he paused to buy a string of ponies, hired a Metis guide called Antoine Blandoine and built enough pack saddles to haul his outfit into the mountains west of Cadomin to pursue big horns. \nIn his “travel, sport and adventure” narrative he called “Saskatchewan and the Rocky Mountains” Carnegie also wrote of his desire to “recruit my health by an active open air life in a healthy climate.” \nAnd life doesn’t get much better than Alberta in August — called Rupert’s Land back then. \nTwo days out on the trail Carnegie’s party reached the little Oblate Mission at Lac Ste. Anne where he received a “most cordial reception” from the priest-in-charge Pere Albert Lacombe. \nWho the Earl described as “agreeable” and a “perfect gentleman.” \nCalling the Catholic church’s remote outpost “a true oasis in the desert.” \nAnd wrote how he “felt quite sorry to leave” especially after Lacombe loaded the Earl’s pack horses with spuds and other garden veggies, dried meat, saskatoon jam and fish. \nMission Hump \nThe fish as likely as not at that time of year came from the famous Mission Hump – where the lake bottom rises from nearly 30 feet to 9 feet then falls off sharply toward the south shore where the historic Metis settlement was once located. \nWe launched my fishing buddy Emmerson’s jet boat at the Yellowstone ramp and cruised across the placid lake surface, with the bow point fixed on the mission grounds, keeping a keen eye on the Lowrance sonar. \nWhen it began to record a rapid rise in the lake bottom we backed off until the screen was no longer marking jig-grabbing vegetation. Then threw out the anchor. \nAs well as cosmic populations of walleye the great historic and spiritual lake is also said to harbor a mighty Manitou. \nThere’s some debate whether it’s a sublime spirit or a canoe-crushing lake monster. An Ogopogo with attitude. \nAlong with my fox red Lab Penny, we had stowed 8-weight flyrods in the boat. But we also brought three tubs of frozen shiners and proceeded to thread them on chartreuse jigs. \nThen flipped them along the drop off and let the baits settle on the weed-free bottom. \nWould the Mighty Manitou smile on us? \nWe began crawling the jigs slowly along the bottom with short pauses thrown it to help induce a following walleye to pounce. \nI heard the braided line hiss in the line-guides of Emmerson’s spin-caster and when I looked up his rod had a nice bow in it. \nFish on. No question, we were in the missionary position. \nNext cast I felt a bump and set the hook. \nAnother walleye came over the gunwales. \nSo the action continued for a long time. \nWhen it tapered off we cruised to the Rock Island bird sanctuary and fished while being serenaded by a calamitous chorus of a thousand squawking gulls. \nAfter as short, unsuccessful return to the Mission Hump, Emmerson spotted a concentration of depth contours on our hydro map along the Ross Haven shore too tempting to pass up. \nWe set the anchor along the drop off and immediately got back into the walleye big time. \nIt turned out to be a spiritual, three-tub afternoon. \nAll released, of course.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T01:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T08:20:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
