Located in Four Seasons Hotel Gresham Palace Budapest, next to the Danube’s iconic Chain Bridge, KOLLÁZS unites the contrasting atmospheres of the bustling metropolitan Pest and the verdant hills of bourgeois Buda.\nVibrant and inspiring, yet casual and affordable, KOLLÁZS Brasserie & Bar is a contemporary European brasserie in a landmark Budapest location. Named for the Hungarian word for “collage,” KOLLÁZS places focus on creative combinations in all aspects of the dining experience.\nThe interior design reflects the artistic era of the 1910s and ’20s, honouring Art Nouveau and Budapest’s legendary coffee house culture. Conceived by EDG Design of San Francisco, the look is a collage of the old and new, the luxurious and simple, in keeping with the character of Budapest. Bringing together four distinct focal points – the rotisserie, bar, wine cellar and patisserie – as well as a convertible, all-season terrace, the environment is at once hip and relaxed, whether for breakfast, lunch or dinner. The contractor was Market Építő Zrt.\nAs a counterpoint to the historic interior, the displayed artwork is contemporary, featuring regularly changing exhibitions curated by Art Market Budapest, the organiser of Eastern Europe’s top international contemporary art fair.\nChef Árpád Győrffy – previously chef at Arany Kaviár and sous-chef at Alabárdos in Budapest – has created a menu that blends local and international flavours, as well as traditional and modern dishes. The focus is on modern European and French brasserie cuisine with signature Hungarian specialties.\nCocktails are traditional with a chic, modern twist, based on a bar menu created by Jaime Jones, the London-based international bar consultant and global gin connoisseur. The localised recipes – and names such as the Zwackapa – are brought to life with authentic Hungarian ingredients such as Unicum herbal liqueur. The bar also gets a helping hand from the kitchen with state-of-the art culinary technologies, such as sous vide, also featuring on the cocktail list. This blend of local ingredients, classic recipes and inventive techniques creates a unique, yet harmonic collage in the glass.\nKOLLÁZS’s sommelier Mátyás Szik has won the Hungarian Sommelier Championship twice – in 2013 and 2014 – and was previously head sommelier at Budapest’s Prime Steak & Wine.\nThe music at KOLLÁZS blends well-known songs, such as Hungarian and French tracks from the 1950s and ’60s, with modern sounds to produce an exclusive soundtrack for the restaurant.\nHeaded by restaurant manager Mihály Kártyás, the KOLLÁZS team provides service that is casual, friendly and social. As part of the plan to create a lively atmosphere, the restaurant offers reasonable prices that are intended to attract an eclectic mix of people.\nAs Budapest emerges as a modern metropolis, KOLLÁZS perfectly captures the dynamic spirit of the city: historic yet contemporary, timeless yet fresh, glamorous yet relaxed. KOLLÁZS promises to become one of Budapest’s most popular dining destinations – welcoming with understated, informal elegance.\nSource:- Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts\nRelated Posts Express your love this Valentine’s Day at Calabash Cove Resort & Spa Romantic Spa Experiences This Valentine’s Day at Four Seasons Hotel Cairo at Nile Plaza Pin.Pack.Go: Four Seasons Harnesses the Power of Pinterest, Transforming Trip Planning One Pin at a Time CAF gets contact to supply trams to Budapest Jumeirah Creekside Hotel raises the bar on sustainability standards", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T16:08:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
