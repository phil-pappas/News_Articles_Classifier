With mobile access prevented during flights, time spent in the terminal is often a chance when travellers use their phones to catch up on work, stay connected with social media, and find entertainment while waiting for boarding to start.” \nThe report also provides carrier-specific data and concludes that Verizon offers the fastest overall speeds compared to rivals T-Mobile, AT&T and Sprint at five of the country’s busiest airports (Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International; Los Angeles International; Chicago-O’Hare International; Dallas Fort-Worth International; and Denver International.) \nDespite being one of the busiest airports in the US, passengers transiting through Los Angeles International may need to brace themselves for a slow internet, as the West Coast hub landed 48th on the top 50 list. \nThe airport that ranked the poorest on the list is Nashville International. \nHere are the top 10 airports for network coverage in the US: 1. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, Atlanta, GA 2. Cleveland-Hopkins International, Cleveland, OH 3. Southwest Florida International, Fort Myers, FL 4. San Jose International, San Jose, CA 5. Dallas Love Field, Dallas, TX 6. General Mitchell International, Milwaukee, WI 7. Washington Dulles International, Washington DC 8. Logan International, Boston, MA 9. Sacramento International, Sacramento, CA 10.
