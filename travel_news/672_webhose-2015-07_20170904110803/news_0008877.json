The team used a relay system and rowed non-stop for 24 hours on 4 ergo machines with the goal of covering as many metres as possible and have so far raised over £1,100. \nThe team used four ergo machines and working in relays they covered a distance of a 1,068,081 metres In the 24 hour period. All had the chance to get involved in the fundraising event and guess how many metres would be covered by the 4 machines and the closest guess to the distance covered won a prize. Prize’s included a night for two at a Sundial Group hotel, a narrowboat experience for 12 and many more all donations and guesses went directly to charity MIMN. Mark Betson; drp set construction technician said of the Ergo Challenge, “the whole team have done an exceptional job and put in amazing effort. The challenge was certainly not an easy one and as you can imagine the hardest part was in the early hours of the morning. Although it was all worth it as the team pulled through and raised over £1,100 for a fantastic cause. I’m glad we could all be a part of it.” Dale Parmenter Group CEO said “The team have once again proved that ‘anything’s possible’ and have all worked exceptionally hard over a very challenging 24 hours. Working and fundraising with MIMN and their projects has always been a pleasure and after the success of the Great Rickshaw Rally we wanted to make sure the Ergo Challenge was a huge success”. The Ergo challenge makes up number 30 of drp’s promise to deliver 35 CSR challenges in their 35th year. The team have already completed several CSR projects including the Great Rickshaw Rally, also on behalf of industry charity MIMN which to date has raised over £4,000. Other projects have included abseiling the arcelormittal orbit in Stratford for charity Springboard UK and supporting the fundraising initiatives for the South London Younger Parkinson’s network.
