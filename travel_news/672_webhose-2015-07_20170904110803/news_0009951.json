The euro zone's second-largest economy is looking to the tourism industry, which employs some 2m people, to help kick-start growth. \nLast month, the government announced a fund intended to boost everything from hotels to heritage sites. \nSheep graze weeds between rows of grapes at the Billecart-Salmon vineyard in Mareuil-sur-Ay, eastern France during the traditional Champagne wine harvest.
