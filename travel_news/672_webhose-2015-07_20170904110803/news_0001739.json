Since the release of their last CD, ‘Into Your Heart’, they have been playing across Ireland, America, the UK, Japan and Europe. The band is well known for its unique brand of rock influenced by soul, gospel and traditional music.\nFor the first time in 20 years, Frances Black and Mayobridge man Kieran Goss will reunite on stage together. Newry Town Hall offers the perfect atmosphere and backdrop for this gently minimalist performance, which will appeal to all contemporary folk lovers. Speaking of the gig, Kieran Goss said:\n“Frances and I are delighted to be performing together again after all these years and especially to be playing in my home town...I remember playing in Newry Town Hall in a band called ‘Nightshift’...it might have been 1978/79...We were terrible but my cousin Sean played bass in Dreams so we got the gig! Since then, music has brought all around the world and back again and I'm looking forward to sharing the stage with Frances and meeting up with old friends and family. It's gonna be a great night.”\nIn addition to the two headline gigs, there are plenty of other activities which will showcase both Newry and music. Saturday’s day time activities will bring in buskers to one of the city centre’s revived shopping streets - Hill Street - for a two hour live music competition. Musical workshops and Irish dancing performances will also be held for children across the city’s various arts and music venues.\nTickets for headline acts selling at £22.50 can be bought from the Sugar Supper Club, the Customer Service Desk, Buttercrane Shopping Centre or via: www.iurcinnfleadh.com; Hothouse Flowers Tickets can also be bought from Bellinis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T02:46:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
