Pierzynski smacked a 3-2 pitch over the right-field wall for a two-run home run in the fourth and Juan Uribe followed with a home run to straightaway center for a 3-0 lead. Matt Wisler got an RBI of his own with his first career hit — a single between first and second — later in the inning.\nThose four runs were plenty for Wisler, who gave up just one hit while striking out six over 5 1/3 innings. He did, however, walk five batters after giving up no walks in his first two starts. He improved to 2-1 with a 2.60 ERA.\nWashington scored its only run in the seventh with Denard Span’s RBI single off Nick Masset. Entering the game, Masset had a 2.70 ERA since June 11.\nCurtis Compton The Braves had lost nine straight games against the Nationals before beating them 4-1 on Wendesday. Curtis Compton / ccompton@ajc.com Number: 9. The number of consecutive games Atlanta had lost against the Nationals before Wednesday night.\nWhat’s next: Washington welcomes new Braves pitcher Manny Banuelos (0-0, 0.00 ERA) to the big leagues with Max Scherzer (9-5, 1.79 ERA), who’s allowed six hits and two runs while striking out 33 in his previous 26 innings.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/07/01/f3/87/042815-braves-gamer-cc7.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-01T19:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T07:04:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
