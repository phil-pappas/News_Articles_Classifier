My friend and I (US citizens) are currently traveling abroad and have India in our sights starting in October. I've read how big a hassle it is to obtain a 10 year multiple entry visa while abroad, so I figured we would just apply for the visa on arrival option. However, it's only 30 days. Neither of us have been to India, so maybe that will be plenty. If we do want to come back for more, would it be possible to head over to Nepal for a few weeks and then apply for another 30 day eTV and head back to India. I've read that you can only do two eTVs in a year, but nothing on how far apart they have to be. Does anyone know if there is a period of time we have to wait in order to apply again? Or could my friend and I go to Nepal for just a day, then apply for another eTV right away? Thanks for your help.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T20:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T22:10:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
