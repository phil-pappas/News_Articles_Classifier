Ahead of next week's 150th anniversary of the first ascent of the Matterhorn, here is my pick of the essential gear and kit needed to tackle some of the world's most challenging mountain climbs. • How to climb the Matterhorn Mammut Trion Matterhorn 35L + 7L Rucksack Price: £130 mammut.ch You will need a functional and lightweight rucksack for the ascent with a capacity of about 30L. It is a simple, comfortable and robust pack that has all the features you need for the climb. It is best to keep the weight down when going to altitude and by limiting yourself to this 35L pack, you won’t be able to overload yourself with kit. The pack is equipped with loops on the belt for technical hardwear you might need to carry such as karabiners. There are a number of pockets for various items you will need easy access to such as a head torch, hat or a snack. There is dual access to the main pack, via either the top of the pack or a side zip. The pack is designed to allow movement while climbing, a simple but effective single buckle system for closure. I found this pack highly practical and very comfortable. The verdict (out of five) Robustness 5 Water resistance 4 Comfort 5 Functionality 5 Value for money 5 A versatile climbing pack for both mountaineering and working on rock faces. Mammut Meron jacket Price : £390 mammut.ch You will need a lightweight, but robust, waterproof and breathable jacket. I opted for the Meron because the articulated cut of the jacket allows easy movement of the torso and arms while climbing. This is an important feature on the Matterhorn as you will be doing a lot of upper body work, hauling yourself up the high ropes and also when climbing up the couloirs. Its hood is ‘helmet compatible’, so you can have the hood up while wearing a helmet and the hood will move with your head so that your range of vision is maintained and your head movements aren’t restricted. There are underarm zips to allow you vent the jacket and the pockets are designed to be accessible even when wearing a climbing harness. The verdict Breathability 4 Water resistance 4 Comfort 4 Looks 5 Overall 4 Value for money 4 The jacket worked really well despite the bad weather I encountered. It could be used for mountain adventures and it met all the manufacturers claims in terms of performance. Nordwand gloves Price : £150 mammut.ch Whatever time of year you climb the Matterhorn you will be faced with snow at some point on the climb. A pair of hardwearing gloves is essential and although you can get away with leather gardening gloves in extremely good weather, I chose to use the Nordwand gloves because they were effective in the cold conditions I faced. They are also robust and waterproof, which meant my hands stayed warm when I was pulling on snow-encrusted ropes towards the summit. It is important that the gloves allow your hands to complete activities that require a high level of dexterity. The verdict Breathability 4 Water resistance 4 Comfort 4 Looks 4 Overall 4 Value for money 4 These were perfect for the cold and wet conditions I faced but you might get away with a pair of leather gardening gloves in warm conditions. Hagloff's Grym gloves (£120; cotswoldoutdoor.com) also work as an alternative to the Norwand model. X-Shot Headtorch Price: £80 mammut.ch You will need a headtorch for the start of the climb. Be sure to take spare batteries. A bright light is important, as you want to be able to look across distances to view the route and also to see what your clmbing partner is doing. The further you're able to see, the better. The verdict Functionality 4 Brightness 4 Robustness 4 Ease of use 5 Value for money 4 There is a vast array of torches on the market – get one that is durable with a low power consumption but with a high lumen bulb. Mammut Haute Route Pants Price: £200 mammut.ch The garment layering system needed for the ascent will depend on the conditions you face. A lightweight but warm and wind resistant trouser might be appropriate for good weather ascents but if conditions deteriorate you need to have something that will provide greater protection. The Haute Route pants are perfect for nearly all conditions. They are highly breathable and very stretchy and I have used them for climbing and skiing in a wide range of conditions. They are one of the most comfortable and versatile trousers on the market. The verdict Breathability 5 Water resistance 4 Comfort 5 Functionality 5 Value for money 5 Brilliant trousers that work well across a range of weather conditions. Scarpa Charmoz Pro GTZ Boot (£200) & Grivel Airtech Newmatic AB (C2) Crampon (£105) cotswoldoutdoor.com These are great Alpine boots and I have used them across of a wide spectrum of mountaineering challenges in the Alps. They take a C2 crampon, which is what you will need to climb the mountain. They are lightweight, robust and comfortable. They are also insulated which makes them perfect for colder conditions. As an alternative to this boot, if your foot doesn’t fit the Scarpa shape, then I would recommend the Asolo Freney Xt GV, which is an equally capable boot. The verdict Robustness 5 Water resistance 5 Comfort 5 Functionality 5 Value for money 5 Any of these boots with these crampons will provide you with great value and totally appropriate footwear for your climb. Base layers Bergans of Norway Svartull Half-Zip (£80); elitemountainsupplies.co.uk Subzero Factor 1 Long Sleeve Top (£45); subzero.co.uk I wore two base layer garments of differing weights and materials for my ascent of the Matterhorn. The Bergans top has a zip neck, which allowed me to moderate my body temperature. It is also a merino wool garment and merino allows you to remain warm when it is cold outside and cool when external conditions warm up. They also have the added advantage of remaining relatively odour-free. The Subzero base layer is made from a polyamide material, which is soft and like a second skin. In combination, the two layers worked really well for the cold conditions I faced during intense activity. The verdict Warmth 5 Comfort 5 Functionality 5 Value for money 5 These base layers come as both tops and leggings. They are a great combination that I highly recommend. Black Diamond Hot Forge hoody Price: £220 eu.blackdiamondequipment.com You will want to carry an additional layer for warmth when you stop for a break during the ascent or something unexpected happens. I chose a down jacket because of its low weight and the added insulation that down offers. The Black Diamond Hot Forge hoody is ultra-light and its trim fit allows for a full range of motion. Most importantly, the PrimaLoft Gold Insulation Down Blend offers highly water resistant and works well across a range of conditions. The verdict Warmth 5 Water resistance 4 Comfort 5 Functionality 5 Value for money 5 A superb lightweight jacket for all conditions. Suunto Ambit 2 HR watch Price : £299 Having the right watch may generally not be a priority for mountain climbers, but it is one of the most critical pieces of kit. The Suunto Ambit 2 comes with a variety of added value components. The watch allows to monitor your body peformance both during your pre-ascent training and also on the mountain. It can measure your heart rate and altitude and also be programmed to warn you about an approaching storm. I was really impressed with the range of activities to which the watch can adapt itself. The verdict Range of features 5 Robustness 5 Ease of use 3 Functionality 5 Value for money 5 A superb piece of kit that is as essential as having the right waterproof jacket. You can climb the Matterhorn without either, but it makes sense to have them both. Harness, helmet and ice axe Black Diamond Couloir Harness (£45; eu.blackdiamondequipment.com ) or Edelrid Orion Adjustable Harness (£85; cotswoldoutdoor.com) are both good options. Edelrid Orion Adjustable Harness Grivel Haute Route Axe ( cotswoldoutdoor.com ) Unless you are well-versed in using an ice axe I would recommend taking advice from your guide on the right size for you. Black Diamond Half-Dome (£50) or Vapour Helmet (£120); costwoldoutdoor.com ) About Paul Hart Few travellers put more demands on their kit than Paul Hart, a former Royal Navy lieutenant commander.
