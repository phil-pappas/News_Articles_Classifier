Photographer's Note \nJimena on a break, walking around Colonia del Sacramento Colonia del Sacramento, formerly the Portuguese Colónia do Sacramento, is a city in southwestern Uruguay, by the Río de la Plata, facing Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is one of the oldest towns in Uruguay and capital of the Colonia Department. Founded in 1680 by Portugal as Colónia do Sacramento, the colony was later disputed by the Spanish who settled on the opposite bank of the river at Buenos Aires.It kept changing hands from crown to crown due to treaties such as the Treaty of Madrid in 1750 and the Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1777, until it remained with the Spanish. It then transferred to Portuguese control again, being later incorporated into Brazil after 1816. Before the independence of Uruguay, it was designated as a \"Villa\" (town) and has since been elevated to the status of \"Ciudad\" (city). Since independence, Colonia del Sacramento has expanded to the north and east, but the original Barrio Histórico (historic quarter) retains its irregular, terrain-fitting street plan built by the Portuguese, contrasting with the wider, orthogonal calles in the newer Spanish area. \nNobody has marked this note useful", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T00:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T02:58:20.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
