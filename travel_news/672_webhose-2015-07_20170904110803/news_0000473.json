During the same period spending on hotels grew by 6.9% while airlines grew by 4.1%. \nThe report adds this growth looks set to continue as 43% of UK consumers say they will holiday in Europe this year to take advantage of the weak euro. \nHowever, ongoing problems with Greece may mean this trend will not continue for long, confidence in the European economy has dropped by three percentage points to 18% in the last week alone. \nDespite the boost for Europe, the UK remains the most popular place for a 2015 holiday with 26% opting to stay in the country while 23% have chosen Spain. A further 12% have opted for the US while 9% have chosen Italy. \nChris Wood, chief operating officer at Barclaycard, said: “A decisive General Election, low inflation, an uptick in earnings and improving job security all contributed to a sense of financial wellbeing among consumers in the second quarter, which in turn led to record growth in both overall and discretionary spending. \n“With the UK’s economic prospects continuing to improve, and as consumers look forward to the summer ahead, spending on entertainment and leisure, large household purchases and overseas holidays was up strongly. \n“With the strength of sterling against the euro making everything from short city breaks to two-week beach getaways more cost-effective, we expect this trend to continue into the third quarter. \n“Rather than a fleeting trend, consumer spending has been growing steadily since last summer as more and more people started to believe that improvements in the macro environment were here to stay. \n“With the UK’s economic recovery appearing now to be firmly established, households are likely increasingly to spend more on themselves and their families.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T14:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T01:44:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
