It’s a cause that’s important to us and we’re very excited to be partnering with the charity.” \nAge Scotland chief executive Brian Sloan added: “Age Scotland is very happy to be working with Barrhead Travel to inspire, engage, and support people in later life. Barrhead’s commitment to actively recruit people over age 50 is a testament to the skills, knowledge, and experience people in later life bring to the workforce. “We’re also looking forward to Barrhead staff ‘hijacking’ our Glasgow shops. Our shops are an important part of Age Scotland, and this kind of event is a great way to get the community involved to support the charity.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T13:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T14:23:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
