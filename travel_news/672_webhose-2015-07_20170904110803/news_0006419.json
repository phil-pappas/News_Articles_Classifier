Requires iOS8 or later.\nCost: The app is free; service is $9.95 a month plus $99 per round trip.\nWhat it does: The app is a valet and virtual closet for business travelers. Dufl stores and maintains your clothes, accessories and toiletries at its warehouse, then ships the items you want when and where you want them. The service is available only within the United States and for international travelers who travel here regularly.\nWhat’s hot: You can do it all from the app. The virtual closet is easy to use: Choose your clothes, order shipments and monitor their progress. Have two trips back to back? No problem. Some of your clothes can be sent to New York in bag No. 1, while others are sent in bag No. 2 to San Francisco. Standard shipping is three days; expedited shipping is an extra $49 per trip.\nWhat’s not: There’s no good way to test the app before registering. When I tried, it asked for an invitation code. Anyone can request one, but it took them three days to get back to me with the code. Once you’re in, though, it could really save you time and lighten your load.\n— Jen Leo, Los Angeles Times", "external_links": ["http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-07-09T22:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T13:24:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
