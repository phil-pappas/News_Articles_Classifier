In Rome, Valentino welcomed everyone to its Mirabilia Romae haute couture show, and in Portofino, Dolce & Gabbana invited top clients to its biannual extravaganza, dedicated to the very special Alta Moda, Alta Sartoria, and Alta Gioielleria collections.\nI went to Rome, where Valentino’s show was the first event before the start of Alta Roma week—the Italian answer to Paris haute couture. The event here consists not only of couture shows, but also features a competition for young designers, fashion students’ portfolio presentations, and other special events.\nPhoto: Courtesy of Daria Shapovalova\nThe new Alta Roma board, with Silvia Venturini Fendi as its president, gives a lot of support to young talents. First to mention is Who Is on Next?—the scouting project developed in collaboration with Vogue Italia . The competition is open for the young designers, whose production is based in Italy. The Who Is On Next? 2015 edition included 11 finalists, each of whom showcased their creations on the runway and during special presentations.\nMy favorites among this year’s finalists included Avanblanc, Giannico, and Blazé. Avanblanc is a brand of accessories created by Francesca Calistri. I love the shape of Calistri’s bags and believe that Avanblanc could become a new street-style obsession. The story of the Giannico brand is fascinating, as its founder, Nicolò Beretta , is only 19 years old. Giannico shoes are already stocked in 40 stores worldwide, and his creations have been seen on red carpets. Blazé was founded by three industry experts—Corrada Rodriguez D’Acri, Delfina Pinardi, and Sole Torlonia. The brand’s statement piece, the jacket, is handmade by expert Italian artisans and is customizable\nPhoto: Courtesy of Daria Shapovalova\nAnother event supporting young talents was a mentoring experiment called 5+5. The experiment brought together five established designers (Thomas Tait, Marco De Vincenzo, Nicholas Kirkwood, Massimo Giorgetti and Paul Andrew) and paired them with five emerging brands (Carlo Volpi, Maria Sole Cecchi, Fernando Jorge, Martino Rose, and Matteo Lamandini), and their collaborative creations were showcased in a special exhibition at Alta Roma.\nOne of the biggest events of the week was the opening of the Azzedine Alaïa exhibition at Galleria Borghese. Sculptural clothes are showcased next to sculptures by artists from Bernini to Canova. Fashion week might be over, but the exhibition will be in Borghese for a while—so if you are in Rome for the holidays, make sure to visit!", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php"], "published": "2015-07-16T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T02:32:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
