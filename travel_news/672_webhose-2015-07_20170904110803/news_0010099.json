New York City and Albany, New York; Philadelphia; Trenton, New Jersey; and New Haven, Connecticut; are just a handful of cities that could receive a drenching thunderstorm ahead of the cold front. \nHot and muggy air pouring into the northeast ahead of the cold front will provide the fuel for the thunderstorms, reported AccuWeather. The cold front responsible for producing these storms will not be strong enough to cause widespread severe weather, but some of the storms may still produce gusty winds and flooding downpours.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T01:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T02:16:59.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
