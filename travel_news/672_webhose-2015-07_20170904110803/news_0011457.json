That is her boyfriend in the background”.\nIt didn’t take long for users to start mocking Reed’s physical appearance, calling him “fat” and “ugly” and posting comments such as, “He’s clearly punching above his weight,” and, “See, this is what people mean when they say ‘it’s what on the inside that counts’.”\nBut in a classy response posted on Twitter , Stevens put the haters back in their place, saying, “I won the jackpot with Christopher”.\n“He may not have rock hard abs like the world tells girls to want in a guy, but really, why does that even matter when you are trying to really find someone you want to spend the rest of your life with?” she wrote.\n“I love him for who he is and he loves me for who I am.”\nStevens’ smackdown has since gone viral and she later told People magazine that she feels like “the luckiest girl in the world”.\n“People should care about what’s inside. What matters is how happy and special he makes me feel.”\nWell played Ashley and Chris.\nHaters gonna hate. @chrisglennreed Source: Facebook\nOriginally published as Woman’s epic Facebook response to fat-shamers", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227438/137605-0fd58722-2795-11e5-bc98-cbdf421eb809.jpg", "http://www.people.com/article/couple-reacts-negative-comments-bouquet-photo", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/relationships/woman-smacks-down-trolls-who-fat-shamed-her-man/story-fnet0gly-1227438135905", "http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/3akgg7/my_friend_caught_the_bouquet_that_is_her/", "https://twitter.com/ash157stev/status/612842969339707392"], "published": "2015-07-12T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T13:54:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
