How did you get into spoken word? I was introduced to the scene whilst I was studying English at Brunel University . I was offered the opportunity to perform at other universities which led to performing at comedy nights and open mics in Soho and Camden. I thought I’d just be making £50 for the odd 15-minute slot for the rest of my life... One of my heroes in the early days was Charlie Dark, the DJ, poet and founder of Run Dem Crew . I got booked to do a performance with Charlie Dark and Polar Bear, Charlie and I got talking after the event and he invited me down to Run Dem Crew. We formed a genuine connection and he hooked me up to do some performance work for Nike back in 2011. Before that, I thought I’d just be making £50 for the odd 15-minute slot for the rest of my life, but thanks to people like Charlie, I've been fortunate enough to be presented with other amazing opportunities on top of that. Recently, I’ve been leading workshops, receiving commissions and performing for brands and organisations such as the BBC, Levis, Britvic, Tate, Adidas, The Guardian and more. Should young poets make the right connections? When I think of Kate Tempest , who was around in the scene when I was cutting my teeth, I think of her singularity of vision; there was a feeling that she was just doing whatever she wanted to do. There was never a sense that she was sniffing around for someone’s approval or trying to get noticed in any other way than delivering unforgettable performances. There has got to be mutual, organic interest that's not necessarily just about business There were other people who were being sneaky, or contrived; over-plugging, spamming on social media and giving their business cards out in a very deliberate way. So my advice would be to go about your work with the same level of sincerity that Kate had; to make genuine connections with genuine people, not just shake the right hands. There has got to be mutual, organic interest that's not necessarily just about business. What are the messages you’re trying to get across? I no longer believe in the notion of pure altruism, but it may be in your best interest to look after others, because if one person is unhappy, it could lead to more widespread unhappiness; ultimately resulting in a situation where I, too, could be at risk. So it then becomes less about peace, love and equality, but rather about the nuts and bolts of human psychology; you'll have to convince the people at the top that it is in their best interest to have a system where we all have equal opportunities, otherwise is just won't happen. What inspired you to become a poet? I was raised in the church and read the poetic King James Version of the Bible quite a lot – sometimes in front of large congregations during the services. I was also involved in theatre at school and so a combination of Shakespeare and the Bible led to my early love of literature and public speaking. The connection I had to words through literature came alive in a different sense... Then, in the early 2000s, when garage began to evolve into grime, rap became real to me and wasn’t just an American caricature anymore. People in my neighbourhood and church would talk about Roll Deep and So Solid. So the connection I had to words through literature came alive in a different sense in the lyrics of Wiley and other grime artists. What are your goals for the future? Over the next few years I’ll be continuing to work on music, DJing and writing – poetry and otherwise. But at the ripe old age of 24, I’m mostly trying to work out how much of me is me and how much has been shaped by my peers; how much is me and how much is the culture I’m a part of. I have a pretty good idea, but it's something I'm still working out. • Find more tips for studying, working and gap years on The Axis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T19:58:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
