Hoping to give the ‘Queen of Games’ a new lease of life by showcasing its appeal on the world-stage, the Crazy Croquet lawn has been created to embrace the sport’s flamboyant heritage, whilst also bringing the 159 year old activity into the 21st century.\nWhen asked what was holding those interested back from playing, the lack of understanding (43%) and shortage of public playing spaces (35%), whilst the sociable nature (37%), traditional Pimm’s drinking (30%) and slow pace (40%) were praised as the appealing aspects of the sport.\nCroquet boasts a long and illustrious history and was first played in Britain over 150 years ago. The pursuit was a highly popular pastime in the Victorian era thanks to gameplay that allowed participants to enjoy a slow paced game in the sun whilst supping on a Pimm’s cup.\nHowever, despite being lauded one of the top three quintessentially British sports, alongside Cricket and Tennis, recent research by Heathrow revealed that almost three quarters (74%) of Brits have no interest at all in croquet and one in 20 have never even heard of the sport.\nIn a bid to revamp the sport and attract a younger audience, Heathrow and Pimm’s have teamed up with London croquet club, Croquet East, to create the spectacular Crazy Croquet course, which will be positioned in Terminal 2 for one week.\nRejoicing the quintessential Britishness of croquet and its age-old association with Pimm’s, the course’s design is inspired by the best of British summertime with a nod to the Pimm’s heritage. Hoping to bring the classic sport into the 21st Century, a number of technical innovations, including laser-guided mallets and musical hoops, will be trialled. Players will be invited to learn the ropes in the unique version of the game, which allows passengers to play a round in just 15 minutes.\nShowcasing the iconic British sport to an international audience at Terminal 2, the crazy croquet course will celebrate a special seasonal offer exclusive to Heathrow, of just £9.99 per bottle of Pimm’s with every purchase, by offering thirsty adults a refreshing glass after their game. The traditional British drink is a popular purchase at the airport, selling over 54,000 bottles of Pimm’s each year – with over a quarter of those travelling to the US with American buyers.\nKim Gray, Head of Retail at Heathrow, said: “Despite being a classic summer pastime, our research revealed that croquet is in need of a revival. Pimm’s is one of the most popular British drinks sold at Heathrow, so we know there’s an appetite for all things quintessentially British and we really hope our fun and quirky croquet course offers passengers the chance to try something new before jetting off, as well as raising the profile of this classic sport.”\nSource:- Heathrow Airport\nRelated Posts Airlines rated on noise performance – Heathrow Airport Norwegian announced three long-haul routes to America Austrian Airlines Financial Results as at 30 September 2013: Positive result gives optimism for break-even in 2013 MIA Director, National Counterparts Travel To Washington, D.c.
