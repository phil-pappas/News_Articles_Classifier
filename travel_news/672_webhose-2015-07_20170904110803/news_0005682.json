Easter, the Harlequins No 8, is among five players who will not travel to the United States on Saturday, with Elliot Daly, Maro Itoje, Stephen Myler and Ed Slater the first four players to be cut from the original 50-man training squad . Easter, 36, is to remain at Harlequins for treatment for what was described as a “sore back” but England head coach Stuart Lancaster is optimistic that the forward will rejoin the squad at Pennyhill Park on Sunday, Aug 2, following their post-Denver break. “Nick will stay for treatment on his back rather than risk aggravating it further with travel and we look forward to him re-joining the squad in August when we will review the squad and also consider those who have been unable to begin the camp after suffering injuries at the end of last season,” Lancaster said. “The players have worked very hard for the past three weeks and there is a really good feel about the group. Denver is the next stage in our training, a chance to develop further in a different environment.” Stuart Lancaster will take his squad for high-altitude training Telegraph Sport revealed on Thursday that all five players would not be travelling with the squad for two weeks high-altitude training in Rugby Town USA, Glendale, Colorado. While the decision, after just three weeks of conditioning work, will have been difficult to take, Lancaster said the players could still yet be involved in the campaign at a later date. “Elliot and Maro have fitted in and trained well and it’s been great for them to be in this environment,” Lancaster added. “They are both young players who have bright futures. They have made a great impression and I am sure other opportunities will come for both of them further down the line. England unveiled their new kit for the World Cup last week “Steve and Ed, likewise, have contributed greatly. Ed has done well to recover from his knee injury having missed the majority last season. However, there is a lot of competition in the second row. “Steve, who is in another really competitive position, has only recently been able to take a full part in training having injured his knee towards the end of last season. But he is getting up to speed now and I am sure he would be ready to come back in should the opportunity arise. \"I have spoken to all the players to explain that things can change very quickly and they can come back in at any point.” England Denver training squad Chris Ashton (Saracens) Dave Attwood (Bath Rugby) Brad Barritt (Saracens) Kieran Brookes (Northampton Saints) Mike Brown (Harlequins) Luther Burrell (Northampton Saints) Sam Burgess (Bath Rugby) Danny Care (Harlequins) Danny Cipriani (Sale Sharks) Calum Clark (Northampton Saints) Dan Cole (Leicester Tigers) Alex Corbisiero (Northampton Saints) Luke Cowan-Dickie (Exeter Chiefs) Lee Dickson (Northampton Saints) Kyle Eastmond (Bath Rugby) Owen Farrell (Saracens) George Ford (Bath Rugby) Alex Goode (Saracens) Jamie George (Saracens) James Haskell (Wasps) Jonathan Joseph (Bath Rugby) Courtney Lawes (Northampton Saints) Joe Launchbury (Wasps) George Kruis (Saracens) Matt Kvesic (Gloucester Rugby) Joe Marler (Harlequins) Jonny May (Gloucester Rugby) Ben Morgan (Gloucester Rugby) Matt Mullan (Wasps) Jack Nowell (Exeter Chiefs) Geoff Parling (Exeter Chiefs) Chris Robshaw (Harlequins) Semesa Rokoduguni (Bath Rugby) Henry Slade (Exeter Chiefs) Billy Twelvetrees (Gloucester Rugby) Mako Vunipola (Saracens) Billy Vunipola (Saracens) Anthony Watson (Bath Rugby) Rob Webber (Bath Rugby) Richard Wigglesworth (Saracens) David Wilson (Bath Rugby) Tom Wood (Northampton Saints) Marland Yarde (Harlequins) Ben Youngs (Leicester Tigers) Tom Youngs (Leicester Tigers) Follow @telegraphsport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T19:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T14:52:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
