But none of the above means anything at all if you don’t put innovation first – a crucial process that many SMEs are ignoring at their peril. Recent research by Bain found that two-thirds of organisations highlighted innovation as a priority, yet fewer than 25pc thought their company was an effective innovator. From adopting cloud computing to digitising holiday requests, there are myriad ways companies can move into the 21st century – so what are the main issues holding SMEs back? Often, it could be as simple as this: companies aren’t prioritising innovation, either because they don’t know how to make changes happen or they feel it is too time-consuming. The cost of doing nothing far outweighs the cost of investing in innovation Steve Sawyer, divisional director at Access Group, thinks that the common denominator in SMEs failing to innovate is their reluctance to progress digitally. “In our experience some SMEs hold back from investing in innovation which slows down their growth, compromises their efficiency and allows more digitally advanced competitors to shine,\" he says. \"What is commonplace is that SMEs are reluctant to adopt digital processes. It’s often the case that SMEs stick with outdated systems that are no longer fit for purpose, and end up stunting growth. \"The cost of doing nothing far outweighs the cost of investing in innovation.” Recent research shows that 81pc of UK businesses are still relying on paper-based systems to monitor sickness levels and holiday requests – the equivalent of more than 4m businesses across the country. This retro method of running a company could be wasting valuable time and resources, so why aren’t more companies making these technological advances? I think SMEs are well placed in the innovation stakes, because we have that ability to be agile and react quickly to a situation Yet other SME leaders feel that they are better placed, as smaller businesses, to lead the way in innovation. “I think SMEs are well placed in the innovation stakes, because we have that ability to be agile and react quickly to a situation,” says Doug Haines, director of The Better Schools Project. “Of course, if we get it wrong, as an SME, there are fewer back-up plans, but trying and failing is seen as a pretty good thing these days, so I’m not worried, provided we tried to do something that helped our customer.” But is it really easier for SMEs to innovate, given their status? Ben Blomerley, CEO of AskHerFriends.com, isn’t sure. “The issue for SMEs is that really game-changing, deep innovation, perhaps in its classic sense, requires a lot of resources and more of a longer term view, which is much harder for us to take,” he says. Failing to innovate is often a fear of failure, or a fear of coming out of a comfort zone “Innovation is about having an instinct for identifying early on the bugs or issues that will organically work themselves out compared to the teething troubles that become the slow and painful death of a brilliant new idea,” Mr Ferrone adds. “There is a reason why some creatures became extinct and others flourished. Will that quirk in the DNA lead to the change in your business that gets a start on the competition or does it waste scarce resources? \"And once you’ve invested are you brave enough to spot if it is not working and put the poor beast down if necessary?” Ciaron Dunne, founder of OfficeGenie.co.uk, points out that if we just look to overseas companies for inspiration, UK SMEs may find that innovating is not as frightening as it seems. \"Failing to innovate is often a fear of failure, or a fear of coming out of a comfort zone. The UK is a mature economy where the 'rules' are much more accepted and embedded – so our SMEs often don't feel the need to take so many risks. Technology provides security, stability and scalability while helping SMEs to work in a more agile and innovative way “Startups from central Europe, Asia and even north Africa seem to have much less fear of failure and develop much more ambitious projects, perhaps uninhibited by the security and accepted 'rules' of business that we have here. It's certainly something to learn lessons from.” Benno Wasserstein, managing director at Box UK, believes that, despite the fears SMEs might have about trying to innovate, taking steps forward digitally could truly transform their businesses. “Ultimately, technology is an enabler,” he says, “providing security, stability and scalability while helping SMEs to work in a more agile and innovative way.” • For more advice on preparing your business for the tech challenges of the future, visit HP BusinessNow You may also be interested in: • Building the right team for your SME • Making flexible working work • Negative feedback: why it pays to listen to your customers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T19:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T13:39:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
