Police carry a piece of debris from an unidentified aircraft found in the coastal area of Saint-Andre de la Reunion. Picture: AFP/YANNICK PITON Source: AFP \nTHE discovery of what looks to be the first piece of debris from the missing MH370 is the strongest indication yet the $180 million search for the plane is being conducted in the right place. \nThe aircraft flaperon identical to that of a Boeing 777, was found on a beach of Reunion Island more than 6000km west of Perth. \nOceanographers and other experts said the discovery was “absolutely consistent” with drift modelling based around MH370’s likely resting place in the southern Indian Ocean. \nA suitcase has also washed ashore at the same location as the aircraft flaperon but but as yet there is no confirmation the suitcase is linked to the earlier debris. \nFAMILIES REACT TO THE NEWS: ‘I selfishly hope this is not MH370’ Johnny Begue in Saint-Andre ... The remains of a suitcase found the day before on the same site where Johnny and his fellow association members also found a two-metre (six-foot) long piece of plane wreckage. Picture: AFP/ Linfo.re/Antenne Réunion Source: AFP \nA local journalist tweeted a photograph of the latest discovery and French language website Linfo.re reported that a gardener found the bag at the same site where a two-metre (six-foot) long piece of plane wreckage was found earlier. \nMH370: Your questions answered \nMalaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said the wreckage is “very likely from a Boeing 777”. \n“Initial reports suggest that the debris is very likely to be from a Boeing 777, but we need to verify whether it is from flight MH370,” Najib said in a statement on his Facebook page. \nAs families processed the news, Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss called for a cautious approach until the debris could be identified. \nAustralia has committed $90 million to the search, a sum Malaysia has promised to match. \nSo far, $76 million has been spent by Australia alone and the government has refused to commit to more once the current search effort is complete. \nEXPERT OPINION: Could ocean currents unlock mystery? \nMr Truss yesterday described the discovery on Reunion Island as “interesting” and said Malaysian officials would lead the investigation. \nCovered in shells and barnacles, the wing part was immediately assessed by experts as having been in the water for about a year. \nA number printed on the debris could assist investigators who indicated it should only be a matter of days before they could confirm the flaperon’s origins. \nUS aviation safety consultant, John Cox, said it looked as if the wing had been broken rather than ripped off, consistent with the theory MH370 made a controlled ditch into the sea. \nA Boeing spokesman said they were helping in any way they could. \n“Our goal, along with the entire global aviation industry, continues to be not only to find the aeroplane, but also to determine what happened and why,” he said. \nThe Malaysia Airlines’ plane disappeared on March 8, 2014 on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, with 239 people on board including six Australians. \nAfter vanishing from radar screens, the aircraft is thought to have flown for up to seven hours before running out of fuel over the southern Indian Ocean, about 2000km west of Perth. \nThe French Island of Reunion is 4000km from the current search zone but drift modelling showed it was possible debris had travelled that far.

Source: Twitter \nImperial College oceanographer Erik van Sebille said debris from MH370 would now be so dispersed, it was possible nothing further would be found on Reunion Island. \n“The other thing is, because the ocean is so chaotic, it will be very hard to track back where this particular piece was 16 months ago,” said Dr van Sebille. \nFor families who have spent 509 days awaiting news of their loved ones, word of the discovery triggered mixed reactions. \nMelia Burrows, whose parents Rodney and Mary were on board MH370 said she and her siblings were hopeful the discovery was related to the plane but they were awaiting official confirmation. \nBob and Cathy Lawton had been travelling with the Burrows, and daughter Amanda Lawton said the wait for answers was almost too much to bear. \n“My sisters and I, we’re just a little bit confused but hopeful that it is an item from MH370,” she said. \n“I guess we don’t want to be disappointed with the news that it’s not related. It really mixes up the emotion.” \nThe Melbourne wife of Malaysia’s Chong Ling, Jennifer Chong, said she “selfishly” hoped the debris was not from MH370. \n“My initial response was “this cannot be it”,” said Ms Chong. \n“I have waited 509 days to see Chong Ling again, alive.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T15:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T17:22:52.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
