Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Jul 04, 2015 Photo courtesy of UWA/UTB Adv: \nLake Mburo National Park, located near the municipality of Mbarara, Southwestern Uganda’s largest town and Uganda’s second largest town, has just received a major boost to its game watching reputation. \n15 Rothschild giraffes were relocated from Murchisons Falls National Park into Lake Mburo, relieving giraffe population pressure in one park while adding another attraction to another. \nUWA’s Executive Director Dr. Andrew Seguya was at hand when the first 8 were leaving Murchisons earlier in the week and used the opportunity to say, “Introducing the giraffes in Lake Mburo will help diversity wildlife and consequently attract tourists.” \nGiraffes went extinct in the Lake Mburo area nearly half a century ago, and the relocation was, therefore, not, as some critics have alleged, an introduction of an alien species to the area but a return of a species which once populated and roamed this part of Uganda. \nThe Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), according to information received, has carried out extensive scientific studies to ascertain that the animals’ main food source was available and that the general habitat was suited to bring the endangered Rothschild giraffe species into the park. The prevalence of acacia trees and shrubs in the park was a primary factor in deciding in favor of Lake Mburo over other possible locations like Kidepo Valley National Park. A team of veterinarian doctors are at hand to monitor the giraffes for the first few weeks to ensure that. \nSister organization Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) supports the relocation in logistical terms and thanks are extended to KWS’ leadership and the staff involved for their assistance to make this relocation a success.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T07:14:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
