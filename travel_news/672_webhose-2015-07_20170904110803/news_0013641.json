The Reunion resident who found MH 17 Adv: \nJohnny Begue became world famous overnight. The French resident from Reunion who found MH 17. Just a few days ago most of the world did not know Reunion or the economic and tourism group of the Vanilla Islands in the Indian Ocean. For more than a day the French holiday island Reunion, part of the Vanilla Islands has become the center of global media attention. \nA Chinese water bottle, an Indonesian canister along with the suitcase found yesterday makes headlines in the Malaysian Airlines disappearance mystery after finding the possible MH370 wing flap a day before. \nThe Vanilla Island Group is on alert. Vanilla Island regions including Madagascar, Mauritius and Seychelles are monitoring the situation on their island shores. Pictures of the smaller debris are popping up on various websites. \n\"It is almost certain that the flaperon is from a Boeing 777 aircraft. Our chief investigator here told me this,\" Malaysian Deputy Transport Minister Abdul Aziz Kaprawi told Reuters. \nA Boeing air safety investigator identified the component as a \"flaperon\" from the trailing edge of a 777 wing. Boeing says the only missing plane of that type is the Malaysian Airlines MH370 that disappeared. \nThe bottle and canister were found after a local beachcomber discovered a mangled suitcase shell on Saint-Andre, the same place where the wing flap washed up. \nOceanographers from the University of Western Australia say the location of the newly-discovered aircraft debris is 'entirely consistent' with a graphic they created 12 months ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T11:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T15:16:00.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
