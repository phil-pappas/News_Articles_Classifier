Do you enjoy stroking their backs, teasing them with toys, or simply watching them blink slowly at you? Make your way to these unique destinations, where felines are the star of the show. \nAoshima, Japan \nJapan has about a dozen cat islands for you to explore but Aoshima boasts one of the highest cat-to-human ratios — try six to one for size. There are about 20 human inhabitants, most of whom are retirees. \nTo reach the island, take a half-hour boat ride from Nagahama Port, Ehime prefecture. \nThere, you will see tabbies and ginger toms curling up in abandoned houses and wandering around the 1.6km-long island. They mostly scavenge for food but the locals — believing the act brings good fortune — feed them, alongside cat-loving tourists. \nFishermen first introduced the felines to eliminate mice, and in a curious twist of fate, the cats themselves have multiplied uncontrollably. In response, the locals sterilised at least 10 of them. But with so many cats around, that did little to bring their population under control. \nAoshima has no accommodation, dining options or even vending machines. As such, it is best to visit the island on a day trip. \nWeather permitting, ferries depart from Nagahama Port at 8am and 2.30pm, and return trips are available at 8.45am and 4.15pm. A round trip costs ¥1,360 (RM42) for adults and ¥680 for children aged six to 12 years. \nHoutong Cat Village, Taiwan \nUnlike Aoshima, Houtong has embraced the influx of cat-obsessed tourists and transformed itself to woo visitors. \nStep out of Houtong Train Station and you’ll be greeted by a huge rattan cat head. Throughout the town, the cat motif is repeated on bridges, maps and almost everything. Shops sell a variety of cat-themed products, ranging from cushions to tote bags and even pineapple cakes. \nIt all began in 2008 when Mr Chan Bi-yun, then aged 53, gathered a team of residents to attend to the welfare of the village’s wandering cats. As pictures of the adorable creatures circulated through mainstream and social media, tourists began to pour into Houtong. \nWhile cats are the main draw of the village, its heritage as a once-prosperous coal-mining settlement deserves a mention. Houtong once produced the most coal in Taiwan during its heydays in the 1970s. But as oil replaced coal in trains and the mines got depleted, people started moving out of Houtong to find better opportunities elsewhere. \nYou can take tours to the abandoned mines and visit museums to look at artefacts. You’ll also spot dilapidated, corroded mining machinery and mining tracks overgrown with vegetation. \nLargo di Torre Argentina, Italy \nBetter known as the capital of the once-glorious Roman Empire, Rome is also home to a cat-loving population. \nKill a cat in Rome (or anywhere else in Italy) and you could be slapped with a €10,000 (RM42,000) fine and face up to three years in jail. Another law forbids the removal of cats that live in groups of five or more in natural, urban habitats. \nAs such, the cats tend to settle among ancient ruins — to the ire of some archaeologists. \nLargo di Torre Argentina is one such ruin, home to around 350 feral cats. Unearthed in 1927, it features four Republican-era Roman temples and the Theatre of Pompey. It was in this theatre’s curia that Julius Caesar was assassinated two millennia ago. \nThese days, you’ll find cats lazing and wandering around the square, attended to by local volunteers known as gattare or cat ladies. They feed the cats, attend to their hygiene needs and sterilise them. \nPart of the ruins is carved out for the Torre Argentina Roman Cat Sanctuary — one of Rome’s two feral cat shelters. It serves as the command centre for a legion of dedicated volunteers and houses about 150 cats that are handicapped. \nDon’t forget to explore the shop for a variety of cat-themed products, such as calendars and clothing that feature cats overlooking Rome’s iconic landmarks. Proceeds are channelled to funding the cat-care cause. \nThe Torre Argentina Roman Cat Sanctuary is open from noon to 6pm daily. Admission is free. The rest of the ruins are accessible at any time. \nStray Cat Hostel, Turkey \nNestled in the centre of the historic city of Istanbul, the Stray Cat Hostel welcomes backpacking travellers missing their cats back home. \nThree cats call this hostel home, while many more roam freely in and out of the hostel’s common areas and courtyard. Some were even seen lounging around on an Arab-styled sofa. \nIn your room and in the common areas, you’ll find paintings and murals of cats. They are in fact a collection of works by travellers who have stayed at the hostel. You can strike an agreement with the owners and add to the collection, getting a free night’s stay along with that. \nThe affection for cats is not exclusive to Stray Cat Hostel. In Istanbul, these whiskered friends are well-loved and can be found everywhere — under alfresco dining tables and on wares left outdoors, as well as in university libraries and mosques. — TODAY More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T04:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T10:45:59.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
