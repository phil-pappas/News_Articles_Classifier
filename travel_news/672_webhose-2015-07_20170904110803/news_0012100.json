That required total purchase amount can be for one item or several. \n\nBased on information obtained from Amazon regarding their free shipping policy, the item or items purchased must cost at least thirty five dollars because it helps offset Amazon's cost for shipping and product distribution. It was reported by Amazon that Amazon has special shipping deals with various carriers,    such as United Parcel Service, FedEx, Ontrac, United States Postal Service and more. \n\nRyan Anderson, President of Crushers, Inc had this to say regarding the free shipping of their Digital Luggage Scale bundle product, \"The suggested retail price for our portable luggage scale bundle product is below the required thirty five dollars in order for it to qualify for Amazon free shipping incentive. However, statistically Amazon shoppers purchase more than one item or several items during a single shopping experience. We anticipate this will be the case when Amazon shoppers add our luggage scale product to their checkout cart. With our competitively priced product, along with any other additional products a shopper may want, we think the price point upon checkout will be sufficient enough to take advantage of the free shipping offer.\"\n\nThe Crushers, Inc Digital Luggage Scale product can be found on Amazon at http://www.amazon.com/Digital-Luggage-Approved-Combination-Included/dp/B00ZDZGBVE. Also, the luggage scale can be discovered when search phrases, digital luggage scale or Crushers inc are used within any Amazon webpage's search bar. \n\nAt the time of this writing the digital luggage scale bundle product has a sales price of 19.99. The original suggested retail price was 59.99. The current sale price reflects a price cut of forty dollars respectively. \n\nAbout Crushers Inc\n\nCrushers Inc is a manufacturer and retailer of consumer goods, electronics and dietary supplements.
