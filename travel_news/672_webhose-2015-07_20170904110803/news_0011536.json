It will also show artifacts used during the war, including weapons. \nThe exhibit will open at the Sullivan Brothers Iowa Veterans Museum in Waterloo on July 14, the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reported ( http://bit.ly/1LSdVS5 ). Vietnam veterans will be on hand that day to talk about their experiences. \n\"What I think is neat about this is the museum is making a display that's going to show family members what Vietnam was like,\" said Rick Reuter, one of the veterans working on the exhibit. \nFor the exhibit, Reuter helped fit a mannequin with equipment worn by a platoon soldier who took lead in a patrol. \n\"Hopefully I'm going to make him look exactly like a point man did when I was walking point in 1967. It would be the very first person in the company. I'm going to try to make everything as realistic as I can. Basically, you have your whole life on your back,\" he said. \nThe exhibit will also show a replica of a living room in the 1960s with a television set with news reports of the time. \n\"It represents the unprecedented nature of war being able to be broadcast to the entire nation,\" said Chris Shackelford, a research and programming assistant for the Grout Museum District, which oversees the Sullivan Brothers Iowa Veterans Museum. \nIn another salute to veterans, a welcome home parade is scheduled to begin at 6 p.m. on July 17 in downtown Waterloo. All Vietnam-era veterans are being invited to participate. \nInformation from: Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier, http://www.wcfcourier.com In this June 22, 2015 photo, Vietnam veteran Steve Wikert works on sanding part of the Main Gate of Camp Tien Sha base recreated at the Grout Museum in Waterloo, Iowa.
