He asks: What does the Mayor of London's announcement of new housing zones mean for me as an SME? Business expert Rachel Bridge replies: In June, Boris Johnson announced a further four housing zones across London: in Havering, Enfield, Tower Hamlets and Redbridge. It is suggested that they will deliver more than 12,000 new homes (of which nearly 3,500 will be affordable housing). There have been 15 (of 20) Housing Zones launched so far, with a total 45,109 homes created. The zones have been created with a total of £162m in funding and are a partnership with the Greater London Authority. They include railway stations, parks, schools and retail and entertainment precincts built on brownfield sites. New housing construction helps to keep home price growth under control. So this is not just good news for people seeking affordable housing in the city, it has enormous potential for the city’s SMEs, and not just those in construction (although in the 1990s SME house builders were responsible for building up to 80pc of new homes in the UK). Moreover, new homes mean new efficiency regulations; new developments mean secondary services to residents. It’s a boon for recruitment. Increasing the amount of available housing in London is a step in the right direction for maintaining the capital’s reputation as a global employment hub. Research by Indeed, the job search company, shows that the UK is the third most popular destination in the world for jobseekers, with London as the biggest draw. However, despite this clear appetite for work in the capital, London businesses of all sizes still struggle to find the right people with the right skills to fill jobs. Indeed’s industry trends show that job openings are up year on year in almost all sectors with transportation (23pc), hospitality (14pc) and HR (12pc) leading the way. Research by Indeed also shows that London struggles more than other UK cities to fill vacancies; in London, 28pc of vacancies are left unfilled after three months, compared with a UK-wide average of 23pc. Peter Burgess is managing director of Retail Human Resources plc, which recruits for the retail industry. He adds: For SMEs, the two major costs are usually staff and premises. Because of the government’s policy of allowing any commercial premises to be converted to residential, to address the worthy cause of creating more housing, the side-effect is that the price of commercial property has gone through the roof in central London. Of course the price of labour is also a function of the price of residential property, rental or purchase. It follows therefore that the chronic shortage of housing is damaging the SME sector. This is disguised by the fact that lots of SMEs are flourishing in London. But so many more would do so if the cost of residential property could be brought under control. Any teenager with a GCSE in economics will confirm that the only way to bring the price of homes under control is to build more homes. So severe is the housing shortage in London that we have actually purchased high flats that we rent out to 14 of our staff because it is the only way to retain them. London is a fabulous city with the only major blight being the ridiculously high cost of homes. Labour turnover (LTO) in London is invariably twice the national average. Our internal surveys show that among our core recruitment area (retail management), LTO in London is typically 35pc with many regions in the UK being under 10pc. For shopfloor staff many retail companies suffer LTO of in excess of 100pc. (The same job vacancy can occur more than once in a year). Of all vacancies listed with us more than half are inside the M25 area. So a million new homes in ten years will be a fantastic boost. However the population is likely to still grow faster than this and, as welcome as this news is, it is perhaps only just keeping up with the current levels of need. My only fear would be that this does not happen soon enough and not before serious damage is done to the London economy through a shortage of skills. Our area of expertise is retail and hospitality, which between them make up just over 20 pc of the labour market. Given that the turnover in these industries is so high, these industries probably make up near 40pc of all vacancies. A recent survey, in which retail managers and professionals were asked what would be the barrier to moving to London, 89pc said that it was the cost of housing. Boris’s plan is by far the boldest yet. It could be bolder and it must be faster. • One way to help protect your business is with the right company car, financed in the best way.
