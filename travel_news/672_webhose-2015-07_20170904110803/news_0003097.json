Here’s how.\nOn Monday, Cuba’s flag began to fly over its new embassy in Washington, D.C. and was hung in the main lobby of the U.S. State Department, indicating that the two countries have resumed full diplomatic relations after 54 years. This is part of Obama’s plan, announced in December, to normalize relations with Cuba.\nWhile this is a significant step in our improving relations with Cuba, it doesn’t mean Americans can easily travel to Cuba from the U.S. yet. The travel embargo is still in place, so visiting Cuba for tourist activities is still prohibited, and Congress will need to act to fully lift this embargo. And that isn’t looking likely at the moment: White House press secretary Josh Earnest said on Friday that the administration hadn’t made any headway in getting Congress to move on that. Still, Earnest added that the administration can take steps on its own to move forward on this issue — and some experts think it won’t be too long before the travel embargo eases even further.\nBut for now, Americans who want to travel to Cuba legally from the U.S. will have to jump through some hoops. Here’s how to do it.\nFirst, you need to understand what kinds of trips to Cuba are allowed. On January 2015 Obama expanded the list of categories — to 12 — for approved travel to Cuba. These now include: humanitarian projects; religious activities; educational activities; professional research; and participating in an athletic event or making a public performance like playing an instrument in a concert. What’s more, if you fall within one of those 12 categories (read the guidelines for each category), you no longer need to submit a written request to the Office of Foreign Assets Control to get to go to Cuba.\n© Provided by MarketWatch How to travel to Cuba before it gets mobbed by Americans This has opened up the field for tour companies offering trips for Americans to Cuba that fall under the new guidelines, like educational trips, particularly so-called “people-to-people” trips, in which U.S. travelers interact with the Cuban people. Prices for these tours vary widely — a few are under $3,000, others upward of $8,000. Among the tour companies now offering tours through the country: Abercrombie & Kent, which offers a 10-day, 24-person trip for $5,695 a person; Insight Cuba, where a five-day trip to Santiago de Cuba, the second largest city in Cuba, starts at $2,995; Explorica’s 9-day Havana Highlight tour that costs around $3,300; and Travcoa’s 10-day “Community, Culture and Cuisine: Cuba” trip for $8,495.\nPretty soon, you’ll be able to cruise there as well. Carnival’s new brand, fathom, which is a social-impact cruise line, plans to set sail from Miami to Cuba beginning in May. The cruise will be a seven-night affair starting at $2,990 per person, not including taxes and port fees, and is allowed to travel because it falls under the government’s “people-to-people” allowance.\nWhile going on a tour or cruise may make traveling to Cuba logistically easier, you can go as an individual — assuming you fall into one of those 12 categories (just be careful not to lounge on the beach doing nothing for too long or the U.S. government may be on your case).\nAnd visiting Cuba as a lone traveler has never been easier: This month, JetBlue began flying direct charter flights from New York to Havana (the first major U.S. carrier to do so), in February CheapAir.com began allowing customers to book flights from the U.S. to Cuba on its site, and there are plenty of charter flights available from carriers (you can expect to pay a hefty price for them: though it’s just 90 miles from the U.S., a round trip ticket from Miami to Cuba costs about $500).\nPlus, there are hundreds of rooms and homes in Cuba now available to rent on Airbnb.com (it began listing rooms in Cuba in April) or you can book a hotel there (though, beware, experts say that it can be hard to find a good hotel as there’s been a surge in interest in Cuban travel recently). You may want to work with a travel agent who specializes in Cuba to make sure you meet all the guidelines for U.S. travelers.\nOther things to know: You’ll need a valid passport (make sure it’s good for six months after your date of travel), a visitor’s visa and proof of health insurance to enter the country. You should also bring cash and prepay when you can, as many establishments don’t accept American credit cards.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.marketwatch.com/", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fAAdfZqg%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fAAdfK0F.img&description=How+to+travel+to+Cuba+before+it+gets+mobbed+by+Americans+-+Provided+by+MarketWatch"], "published": "2015-07-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T03:01:17.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
