We should all realise the importance of our tourism industry and remember that it is the pillar of the Seychelles economy” the Seychelles Minister for Tourism and Culture said. \n\n\nMinister St.Ange saluted Mr Michael Payet and the News Extra team at the Seychelles Broadcasting Corporation as well as the other media houses for helping the Ministry and the Seychelles Tourism Board to keep members of the public informed on the happenings in the tourism industry. \n\n\nMinister St.Ange also spoke about other points such as his door-to-door visits to tourism establishments in the country, direct flights to Paris, and the moratorium imposed on large hotel projects in the country, an announcement that was made by President James Michel on National Day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T15:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T16:27:57.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
