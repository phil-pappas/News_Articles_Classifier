The city is southwest of Fort Worth.\nThe couple’s attorney, Jan Soifer, released a statement saying they haven’t withdrawn the lawsuit and are seeking an agreement from Lang that her office will issue licenses to same-sex couples without delay. They’re also seeking attorney fees.\nLang was not immediately available for comment Monday.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
