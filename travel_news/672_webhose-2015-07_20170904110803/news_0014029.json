After yesterday's item about painters, pools and others impacted by 19 straight days of precipitation, we heard from Star Lanes Polaris, which is having the Best June Ever. The bowling ( and more ) attraction has seen revenue jump 33 percent this month compared with a year ago because of \"increased walk-in business and last-minute events that needed to move indoors due to wet weather.\" It's been marketing itself as the Rain Plan for scheduled parties that need to an escape.
