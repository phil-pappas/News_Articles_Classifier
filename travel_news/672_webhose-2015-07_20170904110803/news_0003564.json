Businesses cited for selling to minors face a 10-day suspension or $2,500 fine. A second violation requires a 30-day suspension; a third strike could mean a lost license. Employees who sold pot to minors could face criminal charges.\nThe checks resulted in an 88 percent compliance rate. When the state has checked liquor sellers, between 85 and 92 percent have been in compliance, according to the Liquor Control Board, which changes its name to the Liquor and Cannabis Board on July 24.\nMost Read Stories The cop and the courier: Seattle’s top-ticketing officer, and its most-ticketed cyclist If you think New Yorker’s earthquake story is scary, better read this Construction of Pacific Northwest’s largest hotel can begin: city ruling ‘The Really Big One’?
