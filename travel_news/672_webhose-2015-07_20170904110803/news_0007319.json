Thome, eTN Africa Correspondent | Jul 25, 2015 Adv: \nWhile on a visit to Kenya were discussions between Presidents Obama and President Kenyatta also focusing on the establishment of direct if not nonstop flights between the two countries, something repeatedly attempted in the past but always fallen foul of security concerns and lack of CAT 1 approval of Kenya’s main airport by the American FAA. Both delegations agreed that the start of direct flights was desirable and would boost both trade and tourism but these political expressions of will and intent require more than just polite applause once the communique is read out. \nPrevious articles here have highlighted the challenges Kenya faces vis a vis the required FAA audit before a Category 1 certification can be achieved. Strict separation of traffic streams, inbound and outbound, is just one of the major criteria which must be fulfilled and the last audit, while reaching close to the pass mark, was still short by a few points. This triggered some frantic activity behind the scenes at the Kenya Airport Authority, in part driven by Kenya Airways’ desire to commence direct flights into the United States, now that the airline has the Boeing B787 Dreamliner on the fleet, which is capable of nonstop flights to the East coast of the US. \nIt is understood from usually well informed sources that a number of measures have been taken to mitigate the shortcomings of past audits with the aim to cross the threshold set by the FAA and pass the next inspection, which is reportedly due in September. \nWhile political will can fast track such audits must the technical criteria and relevant boxes still all be ticked, if Kenya is indeed to launch flights from Nairobi to the US and in turn an American carrier be allowed to fly from a US gateway to Nairobi, as is permitted under the existing BASA, short for Bilateral Air Services Agreement. \nNotably has Addis Ababa’s Bole International Airport Category 1 clearance as does Cairo’s International Airport, with among others OR Tambo International in Johannesburg being another such facility cleared for nonstop and direct flight into the US. This alone is a major reason why Kenya is working frantically now towards accomplishing this certification to facilitate in particular exports of flowers and fresh produce to the United States while in turn boosting visitor numbers from the US to Kenya and the region. Presently do travelers need to connect either via one of the European hub airports or travel with one of the main Gulf airlines, all of which of course connect to Nairobi on a daily and even double daily basis. Watch this space for updates as and when the next FAA audit is going underway and learn about the outcome.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T00:53:59.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
