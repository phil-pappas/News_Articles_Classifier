Based on a rigorous analysis of airport cost and revenue data, the ATRS benchmarking study assessed the productivity and efficiency of nearly 200 airports and selected the most efficient airports in each of the regions, as well as the most efficient airport, overall. The winner this year, demonstrating the highest level of efficiency, is the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. \nAccepting the award, Miguel Southwell, Aviation General Manager stated: ”Hartsfield-Jackson is proud to have claimed this recognition for the 12th consecutive year,\" said Aviation General Manager Miguel Southwell. “This award stands as a testament to our unwavering dedication to operational and managerial efficiency and cost competitiveness. I am grateful to ATRS for recognizing our continued efforts around efficiency and financial health. Greater efficiency ultimately means lower costs for airlines and passengers.” \nCopenhagen Airport CEO, Mr. Thomas Woldbye accepting the Top European Efficiency Excellence Award said: “We see this award as recognition of our efforts to strengthen our position as one of the most important hubs of northern Europe. Although this is the tenth time in twelve years that Copenhagen Airport wins the award for being Europe's most efficient airport, we do not take it for granted. We are constantly working on increasing customer satisfaction and efficiency through automation and self-service solutions, which also means that we are reducing costs for our partners; the airlines, handlers, concessionaires and all other operators at Copenhagen Airport.” \nDr Yiannis Paraschis, CEO, Athens International Airport said: “We are indeed deeply honored that Athens International Airport has been distinguished by the esteemed Air Transport Research Society as the most efficient airport in its category in the performance benchmarking for 2013. The specific year, marked by slow worldwide growth and a highly critical economic and political situation in Greece, has indeed been extremely challenging. \nThanks to its solid basis, AIA has managed, despite adversities, to address significant market challenges, protect its business model and continue to deliver substantial value to all stakeholders and the Greek economy. Targeted efforts towards minimizing traffic losses and revenue streams, in combination with operating cost optimization, have been key to that end and allowed AIA to post healthy results in 2013, without compromising its value-for-money services. \nIt is true that we are operating within a highly critical environment having to face major challenges; we are, however, firmly committed to continue all our efforts to weather the storm and come out even stronger”. \n“As the aviation industry has become more competitive, airports have had to compete for business from airlines, as well as from passengers and shippers. Each year the ATRS analyzes data on airport costs and outputs in order to arrive at the most efficient airports in all the major regions of the world. We are pleased to announce this year’s winners at our World Conference in Singapore – airports that serve as the benchmarks for the industry” said Professor Martin Dresner, President and CEO of ATRS. \nThe 2015 winners \nTop European Efficiency Excellence Award Copenhagen Airport Top European Small-Medium Size Airport Efficiency Excellence Award Athens International Airport • Top North American Efficiency Excellence Award Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport • Top Asian Airport Efficiency Excellence Award Jeju International Airport, Korea Airports Corporation • Top Oceania Airport Efficiency Excellence Award Sydney Airport \nThe ATRS was established to enhance research capability for multi-national and multi disciplinary issues on air transportation, and to foster interaction with international and national institutions, which deal with policy, management strategy, and/or infrastructure issues concerning global aviation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T10:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T11:52:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
