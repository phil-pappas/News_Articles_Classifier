Fox, star of Silent Witness, said she \"loves it\" when \"gentlemen are allowed to be gentlemen\", opening doors or giving up their seat for her. The 41-year-old described herself as a \"die-hard, old-fashioned romantic\", adding she believes in equality but would not wish it to discourage men from their manners.
