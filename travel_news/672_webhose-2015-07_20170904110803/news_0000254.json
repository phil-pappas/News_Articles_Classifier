Colquhuon’s dumping ends a run of three games since he returned to the AFL.\nPower midfield coach Michael Voss explained each of Krakouer and Colquhuon would get strong advice - and notes of challenge - after missing at selection.\n“Krak needs to have consistency across the game - that is his challenge,” Voss said. “We know that when Krak has the ball in his hands, something happens. But we are looking for other things as well.\n“Sam has certainly played well for the first couple of weeks - but he also has to work on some things. We also understand being out of the game for a while (with the knee injury) can do that (to a player’s form).”\nMoore and Colquhuon are replaced by the equally inexperienced midfielder Karl Amon and speed-machine small forward Jake Neade.\nCOLLINGWOOD is unchanged as coach Nathan Buckley holds faith in a group that has pushed - but not beaten - AFL top-four measuring sticks, Fremantle in Perth and Hawthorn at the MCG, in the past fortnight.\nThe Power at 5-8 faces the challenge of winning at least eight of its remaining nine home-and-away games to qualify for the AFL final series in September for the third consecutive season under Hinkley.\nPort Adelaide does have a strong record against Collingwood under Hinkley’s watch - two wins from three matches, including an elimination final at the MCG. The loss - in the last meeting in round 19 last season at the MCG - was by just six points.\nBuckley expects the Power players - who take to the field for the first time since premiership assistant coach Phil Walsh died on Friday - to be galvanised amid their tragedy.\n“One thing I can assure Ken Hinkley is that once he gets to the ground with his players and his coaches with a job to do, they will be galvanised towards that,” Buckley said with experience from leading the Magpies last Friday as the AFL world coped with Walsh’s death that day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T20:24:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
