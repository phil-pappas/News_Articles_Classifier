No-one kicks scores on this crappy ground (ANZ Stadium)!\n“Over to you, West Coast,” he said, suggesting that they’re the only team left that can knock off the current rampaging run of the Hawks.\nIn their regular Monday appearance, Melbourne coach Paul Roos and Pies coach Nathan Buckley both raved about the team’s skills.\n“That’s what we’re aspiring to do,” said Buckley.\n“It’s a real heads-up to where you’ve got to get to, and it takes time, it takes energy and it takes patience.”\nRoos said that the Hawks “value the basics of the game and they value the possession, and that’s what stands out.”\nOn the way they go about their footy, Buckley said “it’s got nothing to do with footy … if you look across the best teams in the competition, they’ve got elite leadership, breadth and depth.”\n“It’s not just waiting for your senior coach to point out the standards of your club … it’s getting your 45th player or your masseur or your boots studder to not walk past something that isn’t acceptable in your environment.”\nHawthorn had a 44% conversion rate once inside 50 against Sydney, the most efficient of any team in a game in 2015.\n“The machine has moved into top gear over the past couple of weeks,” said Gerard Healy.\nLoyal Hawks man Jason Dunstall tried to calm the analysts down when he said that “there’s still a lot of water to go under the bridge.”\n“Everyone can be stopped,” agreed Robinson, comparing it to giving a horse weight to slow them down in a race. “Cups don’t just get handed over”.\nCLARKO ON THE COUCH\nTRIPLE premiership coach Alastair Clarkson joined the team On the Couch to discuss Hawthorn’s form and the way the game has changed in recent months.\nAfter starting 4-4, the Hawks have won seven straight games and are now the shortest-priced favourites for the premiership in recent memory.\n“We’ve had to work pretty hard over the last eight weeks,” said Clarkson, “we put ourselves in bit of a hole by starting pretty scratchy”.\nClarkson said in recent weeks that the team needed to really assert themselves to prove their credentials.\nBut he still pointed out that home and away form doesn’t determine who wins the flag.\n“There’s been a lot of sides that might’ve been the better side in the home and away (season) that didn’t take the chocolates,” he said.\nClarkson pointed to Geelong in 2008, St Kilda in 2009, and even the Hawks in 2012 as the best regular season sides that didn’t win premierships in their years.\nAsked whether the team had undergone many changes on-field after winning back-to-back flags, Clarkson said it was more in the roles of players than in actual game style.\n“There’s been some changes in terms of the roles we have players play, but in terms of our structure — the way we go about it — there haven’t been too many changes,” he said.\n“Roughead’s continued to play through the middle of the ground … we feel it’s really good for our side to have that sort of flexibility.”\nThat flexibility has seen Hawthorn move from 16th in the AFL in 2009 for number of individual goalkickers to first this year, going from 6.77 to nearly 10 per game.\nClarkson also discussed Lance Franklin, saying after his much-publicised move that “if Buddy was at our footy club right now, he’d be playing higher up the ground and through the midfield as well.”\n“We’ve had to go through a bit of pain to realise that — we had too much of a reliance on Buddy and Roughead even as recently as 2012 and that probably hurt us a bit.”\nOn the Couch panellist Jonathan Brown, who played in a back-to-back-to-back premiership side with the Brisbane Lions, asked Clarkson how the club has addressed the potential of a ‘threepeat’.\n“We haven’t spoken about it much — albeit it may have gotten a bit of a mention when we were 4-4,” said Clarkson.\n“It’s just so far away and it’d be a fantastic achievement, but we’ve got a lot of work to do.”\nHawthorn's evolution 4:33 Play video\nAFL: Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson joined the On The Couch panel to discuss the evolution of Hawthorn.\nFox Sports 20 Jul 2015 Sport/AFL/Shows/On The Couch CLARKO ON CONGESTION\nAS an esteemed coach, Clarkson has plenty of insight into the way in which footy is played.\nSo with plenty of debate into the congested nature of footy, with lower scoring and a larger number of stoppages and tackles, Clarkson tried to explain why it has gone on.\n“We haven’t had significant rule changes but what’s been significant has been the interpretation of rules,” he said.\n“We’ve got a rule for instance, holding the ball … there’s been this view over the past 15 to 20 years that we need to protect the ball carrier.\n“I sit there and say why because we’ve now got this prior opportunity rule … players are very smart, and so are coaches. With prior opportunity, they know if they hold the ball in, then it becomes a ball-up and creates more congestion.”\nGerard Healy asked if he believes the rules committee should get rid of prior opportunity.\nClarkson said he would rather that they give more consideration into “making it an even balance between the guy who’s getting the ball and the guy who’s tackling.”\n“At the minute it’s too heavily weighted towards the ball carrier. They’re very smart, they know they can duck their heads because they’ll get a high infringement.”\nClarkson also mentioned the lack of policing on players deliberately kicking the ball out of bounds.\n“What’s happened to the tapping the ball through deliberately for a point (rule),” he asked.\n“If you’re going to keep the game alive and have it really interesting and have really high scoring, don’t allow teams (to deliberately rush behinds).\n“If you deliberately rush it over on one side of the post, it’s a free kick, but if it goes through for the point it’s legitimate.”\nClarkson said he wants a stricter interpretation of the rule, suggesting that the rules that we want to ‘fix’ footy are in place, but need to be interpreted differently.\n“It’s not the umpires’ fault, they’re just umpiring according to how the rules committee want the rules to be governed.\nI think we need to get it back towards a game where it can flow … it doesn’t need to be significant change.”\nHe also mentioned how sides are dropping back a seventh defender, even at the start of games.\n“Defenders are that smart … if the ball is coming in high, one of the defenders will go, well I’ve got a teammate here, I won’t even worry about the ball, I’ll just go and block the path of the forward getting to the ball.\n“And the umpires sit and there … and the defenders know exactly what they’re doing. There’s not a legitimate chance for that forward.\n“Pay a couple of free kicks in that regard early in the game, coaches and players will have to start to run at the ball to compete for the ball and that’s what we want. We want high marking in our game.”\nBUCKS ON THE PIES’ ‘JUDGEMENT MONTH’\nA MONTH ago, the footy world proclaimed the next four games would prove whether Collingwood were true top four threats or just pretenders.\nFour close losses later, it’s still hard to judge where the Magpies are at. Nathan Buckley tried to do so on AFL 360 .\nAsked what he learned, Buckley said “we learned that our best football is pretty good but you need to play four quarters of your best football to beat the best opposition … I could’ve told you that a month ago though.”\n“We’ve proven that we can stand up in pretty high-pressure situations, but that we’re just that little bit off at the moment when you put us against the best teams.\n“So that’s something we started the year out trying to close that gap, and we believe we’ve closed that gap — although we would’ve liked a few more wins over the past month.”\nBuckley said that there were three specific elements that they knew West Coast would test them in and that they didn’t succeed in — centre bounces, moving the ball from their defensive 50, and holding the ball in their forward 50.\nBut Buckley said he has been pleased with the way his young Magpies side have gone about their footy.\n“I can categorically say that when we look the mechanics at our game, there’s areas that we can get better,” he said.\n“When I look at the attitude and effort part of our performances, very rarely … we’ve had over the course of the whole season where we haven’t been bringing that.\n“When you’re getting that as a coach, I think you’ve got plenty to work with, and as soon as we don’t get that is when we’ll really be holding each other to a task even more.”\nCollingwood's poor month 2:59 Play video\nAFL 360: Collingwood coach Nathan Buckley discusses his teams poor month of form and why hes not disappointed with the Magpies on AFL 360.\nFox Sports 20 Jul 2015 Sport/AFL/Shows/AFL 360 SWANS AT THE CROSSROADS\nAFTER a thumping from Hawthorn, their Grand Final opponents just last year, Sydney were under the microscope.\n“Quite clearly they’re at a crossroads,” said Gerard Whateley, saying that the Swans “looked as slow as any team in the competition” on Saturday night.\nMark Robinson asked whether “they keep going the same way or do they bite the bullet and say we have to make changes.”\n“They’ve got to do something with Tippett. We’ve got enough evidence to say that isn’t working.\n“That talent’s not being sucked out of him, it’s not being utilised in the role he’s playing.”\nRobinson suggested turning Tippett into a dedicated ruckman.\nJonathan Brown agreed On the Couch, saying “I don’t see Kurt Tippett as doing what has him play the best football.”\n“I haven’t seen him play as well as he did in the 2012 Preliminary Final against Hawthorn in Sydney.”\nBrown stated that Tippett has very good size but has problems releasing from a man when in a one-on-one contest, showing vision of how Tippett in the 2012 Prelim was leading for the ball much more often.\nThe Couch team pointed out that the Swans have allowed 110 points per game against Hawthorn since the start of 2013, compared 69 points per game against every other club.\n“There’s holes on every area of the ground,” said Brown, “usually if you’re going to be a premiership contender you might have a hole in one area of the ground throughout the season.”\n“They’ve got holes in every line. Obviously they’ve got issues in the forward line — Tippett’s struggling, they haven’t really got any small forwards — they’ve got issues with the midfield, they’ve got issues with the rucks, and they’ve got issues in the defence.\n“They’ve got problems bringing the ball out of defence, and obviously a guy like Ted Richards … he’s been struggling for form.”\nJason Dunstall brought up the lack of efficiency going forward from some of the Swans’ midfield stars.\nThe AFL average for hitting a target inside 50 is 20.4%, but Dan Hannebery is at 8.6%, with Josh Kennedy at 13.5%, Lewis Jetta at 16.9% and Kieren Jack at 18.0%.\n“I think this is a combination of being under pressure when delivering and not having the right forward structure,” Dunstall said.\n“They’ve got to stop being stubborn … and maybe play a bit of their opponents’ game and play more openly.”\nOther topics covered on the Monday night TV agenda:\n* TODD GOLDSTEIN SHOULD BE THE ALL-AUS RUCKMAN\n* HAYDEN BALLANTYNE’S

as he proclaimed his game against Essendon one of the best by a ruckman in the modern era.\n“You can’t play the ruck better than that,” he said. “He toyed with whatever opposition was put forward.”\nRobinson agreed, suggesting that “it may be the best individual performance we’ve seen this year.”\nBoth hosts agreed that Goldstein should be the all-Australian ruckman for 2015.\nHAYDEN Ballantyne’s shoulder injury that will see him out for the rest of the home and away season was called “a nasty one” by Whateley.\nRobinson explained that “he gives them more than balance, he gives them a bit of attitude.”\nThat attitude “all adds to the little components of being a successful team,” he said.\nWhateley was more concerned about his scoring and how the Dockers would fare without it, as they agreed that Chris Mayne will become “ever-so important”.\nMayne matched his career-high with four goals against Carlton.\nTHE emotion and impact of Showdown 39 on Sunday was felt in more than one way, said the AFL 360 panellists.\n“It was a day that won’t soon be forgotten,” said Whateley. “It was thrilling and it was beautiful.”\nRobinson thought Travis Boak’s effort to get his Port Adelaide side back into the game was “mammoth”.\n“I think that was the game of the year … and I think that was the day of the year,” he said.\nEAGLES defender Jeremy McGovern’s injury may be the tipping point, according to some analysts.\nPaul Roos praised West Coast, saying “I rate them really highly … when you look at game style and their ability to play a certain way for an extended period of time … they’re elite.”\nAsked whether their zone defence structure helps them deal with McGovern’s injury, Roos said “it hurts you eventually … if you’ve only got one (tall) down there … there’s no doubt about that.”\n“The place where sides are going to be able to challenge them is moving it into the forward line to those tall players,” said Nathan Buckley.\n“As long as you’ve got six or seven that can play the style, the personnel matters less.\n“There’s no doubt they’re going to be hurt by the third tall coming out, but their form is so strong.”\nBUCKLEY was also asked about how Jesse White will deal with a situation where he has to stand up as the main spearhead in their forward line.\nThe Pies coach explained that Jarrod Witts, Darcy Moore and Brodie Grundy will be crucial, as were Alex Fasolo and Jordan de Goey on Saturday.\n“Fasolo and de Goey were good in their own way … everyone seems to go for spearheads, but potentially your back two or three are as important as any for scoring,” referencing transitions from defensive 50.\nROOS believed that the first half of Melbourne’s win over Brisbane was the best half of footy they played all year.\n“Chris Dawes was as good as he’s been all year,” also praising Tom McDonald’s forward play and Jeremy Howe.\nRoos explained how important it was for the Demons to get over the hump of four wins, which was all they achieved in years previous.\nDiscussing how the Hawks are free-flowing and go for more exciting play, Roos discussed the youth of his side.\n“Sometimes with our players a ball will hit the ground and we’re reticent to pull them up on it.”\n“The Hawks play with that abandon but they’ve spent years developing that,” explained Buckley.\nTHE panel was also negative on ANZ Stadium, particularly the bolts that Jarryd Roughead encountered on Saturday night.\n“It’s a disgrace,” said Robinson, with Roos calling it shocking.\n“Surely the contract is done now”, said Buckley.\n“The bar mat they whacked over the top of it didn’t go any good.”\nAsked about what it would take to get Sydney to move from ANZ Stadium permanently, he said “generally decisions get made on the back pocket.”\n'There's holes all over' 3:08 Play video\nAFL: Gerard Healy, Jonathan Brown and Jason Dunstall take a look at some of the issues confronting the Sydney Swans following their big loss to Hawthorn.\nFox Sports 20 Jul 2015 Sport/AFL/Shows/On The Couch ON THE COUCH (FOX FOOTY)\nTHE Couch team showed two ladders — the real premiership points-based one and the percentage ladder, which prioritises teams’ percentages.\nThat ladder has Hawthorn in first and Collingwood back in the top eight.\nDiscussing the ladder, Jason Dunstall said “this year, I think more than any, there’s interest in every position on the ladder.”\nJonathan Brown said that Port Adelaide’s finals chances had gone entirely and that if GWS are able to beat Geelong this coming weekend, they’re locks for the finals.\n“They have a list that bats deep,” Brown said of the Giants.\nHowever Brown said that the Magpies are no chance of making the finals if they lose to the Bulldogs this week.\n“I really rate Collingwood, but at the end of the day it comes back to wins and losses,” he said.\nGEELONG ’s victory over the Western Bulldogs received plenty of praise from the Couch team.\n“They just won’t go away the Cats, and to do it without Joel Selwood showed a lot of intestinal fortitude and courage,” said Jason Dunstall.\nGerard Healy was very impressed with Josh Caddy.\n“I had my doubts that he would be able to justify the investment they put in him … but this was probably his finest moment in a Geelong jumper.”\nBrown said that Mitch Duncan’s return was crucial, suggesting that he was leading the best and fairest at the club before his injury.\nBrown also discussed the way in which teams have to transition when losing a large number of players to retirements at once.\nHe said that you can’t have a bunch of players going out on their own terms like Dustin Fletcher is at Essendon.\nGOLD Coast didn’t get the win on Saturday but the team were impressed with Rising Star nominee Touk Miller.\n“He crashes through the packs, he’s really skilled as well … he obviously has leadership qualities” said Brown, referencing his captaincy at the under-18s level.\n“Along with him and Adam Saad, the Suns would be pretty excited once they get all of their players back.”\nT ALKING FOOTY (7 MATE)\nAFTER speculation that Jobe Watson should leave Essendon, his father Tim was adamant that he couldn’t see it happening.\n“I know how tough this year has been on him and how difficult the last couple of years has been, but at no stage have I had any conversation with him where he said that this would be a lot easier if (he) was playing somewhere else,” Watson said.\n“I haven’t seen him as good and contented as he is right now in a long time.”\nWayne Carey asked Watson about Jobe’s captaincy.\n“I think that comes up just about every year at a club once you’ve been the skipper for a period of time,” Watson said.\n“I think Dyson Heppell is obviously the successor, and I think that will be a handover at some stage.\n“I don’t know whether it’s the right time now or if it would be in 12 months.”\nFOOTY CLASSIFIED (CHANNEL 9)\nON Channel 9’s Footy Classified, the panel discussed whether Sydney’s premiership window had shut.\nEssendon champion Matthew Lloyd is concerned by the Swans’ form over the past month, saying: “On what I’ve seen they can’t win the premiership”.\nJournalist Craig Hutchison said the Swans lacked depth because of the money paid to forwards Lance Franklin and Kurt Tippett had tightened their salary cap.\n“They don’t bat any deeper than about 25 or 26,” Hutchison said.\n“The rules are prohibiting them from recruiting what they need, particularly down back. They’ve spent a lot of money on the top end of their list.”\nTHE conversation immediately turned to Hawthorn’s recent dominant form, with Melbourne great Gary Lyon saying “they’re better than last year”.\nLyon said the Hawks were on track to win another premiership.\n“Their ability to score is absolutely pivotal,” Lyon said.\n“(Coach) Alastair Clarkson gets the most out of his players and I love the fact he throws them around and he uses them in positions where he maximises them.”\nLloyd said the Hawks’ ability to cover injuries set them apart from every other team.\nOriginally published as What you missed on TV last night", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/the-unbeatable-hawks-clarko-on-rules-and-bucks-on-the-pies-form-what-you-missed-on-tv-last-night/story-e6frf3e3-1227449991576", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content4.video.news.com.au/foxsports/prod/archive/2015/07/20/DVU_OTC_CLARKSON.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content4.video.news.com.au/foxsports/prod/archive/2015/07/20/DVU_AFL_360_PIES.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content4.video.news.com.au/foxsports/prod/archive/2015/07/20/DVU_OTC_HAWKS.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc"], "published": "2015-07-21T06:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T18:07:41.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
