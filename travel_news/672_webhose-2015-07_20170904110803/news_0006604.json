However, this summer the hotel is making itself even more irresistible to event planners and PAs by launching a new campaign offering ‘Personal Perks’. \nAs an appreciation for considering booking an event, meeting or conference at Brooklands Hotel, for every enquiry made until the 31 December 2015, bookers will be taken to a new dedicated microsite to play for a randomly-selected ‘Personal Perk’. Up for grabs are a trip to Paris with flights for two people, overnight stays and upgrades at Brooklands Hotel, Mercedes-Benz World driving experiences, Black Card annual memberships, six-course taster menu experiences, £500 of hotel vouchers, cream tea vouchers, discounts at the hotel’s BSpa and double AA awarded restaurant 1907 Restaurant, Bar and Grill’, branded gifts and more. All contracted bookings that take place before the 31 March 2016, will be entitled to claim their ‘Personal Perk’. A unique code based on contractual spend will be generated for each booking made, which will correspond to the “thank you” awarded by Brooklands Hotel. Brooklands Hotel offers a very high standard of events and meeting services, with excellent facilities available and a dedicated team with a “make it happen” attitude. There are nine contemporary meeting and event rooms, the largest of which can cater for up to 220 delegates. There is a private entrance for meetings and events, which are conveniently located on the ground floor and all in one place. A dedicated banqueting kitchen is complemented by a private events bar and ample, complimentary car parking. The in-house team are always on hand to personally ensure every event is a success and uniquely designed. A Day Delegate Package and a 24 Hour Package are available for meeting and conferences. The Day Delegate Package includes room hire, arrival tea & coffee, morning and afternoon breaks, still and sparkling water, LCD projector and screen, flipcharts, stationary, two-course buffet lunch, Wi-Fi and car parking. The 24 Hour Package includes a three-course course dinner, either in the hotel’s double AA awarded 1907 restaurant, bar & grill or private dining space, overnight in a Deluxe guest room, full breakfast, use of the BSpa and BFit facilities, 25% discount on mid-week spa treatments and a residential personal training session discount. Brooklands Hotel also offers ALICE, an exclusive app that gives both event organisers and delegates access to a Brooklands personal assistant who is on call at all times. The app brings many services at just the tap of a smart phone or tablet, from ordering food, drinks or stationery, without interrupting the meeting or event. Brooklands Hotel is one mile from Weybridge train station with access to London Waterloo within 30 minutes, close to the M25, 17 miles from London Heathrow Airport and 33 miles from London Gatwick Airport.
