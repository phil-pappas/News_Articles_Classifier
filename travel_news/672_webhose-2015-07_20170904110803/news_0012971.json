When : From July till October annually Where : Kenya - Termed as the eighth wonder of the world and characterising the struggle for survival in the great African plains' harsh environment, around 1.4 million wildebeest migrate to the Maasai Mara in Kenya , round and back again in a never-ending quest for fresh pastures. You can witness this spectacle of the nature by participating in the safaris, which are organised specifically around the migration. Stay over at the numerous camps and lodges that offer a chance to observe in style or rough it in a tent. During the migration period, animal sightings are aplenty and catching a glimpse of lions tracking down their hunt or elephants grazing the greener pastures is a sight you will love to watch. Obon When : August 8-12, 2015 Where : Japan - Obon is an annual Buddhist event for commemorating one's ancestors.

At the end of Obon, floating lanterns are put into rivers, lakes and seas in order to guide the spirits back into their world. The customs followed vary strongly from region to region.
