Tourism New Zealand is the second destination after Sedona, Arizona, USA receiving this award. So how does one make it on THE LIST ? \nAnyone can nominate a hotel, destination, attraction, airline, person, cruise, or restaurant based on a best moment or experience. THE LIST is not about rating how “luxurious” something is. It is more about how much something is appreciated or different. There are no fees to nominate or to earn awarded an addition to THE LIST \nBrazilian traveler, Karem Basulto, appealed to eTN to add Tourism New Zealand to the list of destinations awarded this prestigious recognition. \neTN Reader, Karem Basulto, from Sao Paulo, Brazil said: \"New Zealand is a complete destination, with luxurious experiences, vibrant cities, preserved environment, and hospitable people.\" \n“I attended to Trenz, New Zealand´s major tourism fair, last year, and was surprised by the organization and many options that they had prepared for their visitors. It was in Auckland, but after the trade show, I went to Rotorua and could realize how many experiences they can provide to visitors - in adventure tourism, health, gastronomy, as well as luxurious experiences. \n“I am a Brazilian travel writer that has been traveling for the last 15 years as a professional. I used to work for a travel and tourism newspaper, attending many international trade fairs.” \nTourism New Zealand’s Chief Executive, Kevin Bowler, said: “I am delighted to hear that New Zealand has been recognized as a top destination and was added by eTN to THE LIST . \nNew Zealand is a country that loves to welcome visitors and gives them the kind of holiday experiences they are still talking about long after they have returned home.” \neTN Publisher Juergen T. Steinmetz said: “I never had the privilege of traveling to New Zealand, but as a neighbor here in the Pacific and with new direct flights from Honolulu, I am now inspired to check it out. We’re pleased to add New Zealand as the first non-US destination to THE LIST.\" \nThe New Zealand Tourism Board goes on with their statement: \n“New Zealand’s diversity - landscape, climate, and people - has turned this small South Pacific country into a major tourism destination, far exceeding its global imprint. New Zealand is a young country - a nation that’s fresh and welcoming, and a place to enjoy life as it should be. \nNew Zealand’s two main and countless off-shore islands offer contrasting geography and a temperate climate setting the scene for outdoor adventures and a unique Pacific lifestyle. Likewise, New Zealanders are the product of diversity - Māori, European, Pacific Island, and Asian - together forming a rich cultural landscape. \nNew Zealand offers a number of tourism activities, and there is something on offer for backpackers as well as travelers looking for luxury. One could find themselves skiing on a mountain, white-water rafting down rivers, and tasting world-renowned wines, all in one day. Everything is close in New Zealand which lets tourists experience the beautiful country with ease.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T08:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T11:57:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
