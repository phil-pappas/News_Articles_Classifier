Preheat the oven to 160C/325F/gas mark 3. Line a baking sheet with baking parchment. Place a tablespoon of the mixture onto the baking sheet and spread it out thinly with the back of a spoon to a diameter of about 13cm (you should be able to get four circles on the baking sheet). Bake for around 8 minutes until golden. Have four upturned glasses ready. Remove the tray from the oven, and, working quickly while they are warm, bend each tuile over an upturned glass to make a tulip basket, or just serve them flat. Like pancakes, the first few never work but don’t give up! Repeat in batches of four. Serve with seasonal fruit salad and lemon verbena ice cream (recipes below). To assemble the summer fruit basket, spoon a pool of raspberry sauce on the plate. Set a tuile basket on top and put a scoop of ice cream inside. Tumble some of the fruit over the ice cream (think Carmen Miranda’s hat), dust with icing sugar and serve.
