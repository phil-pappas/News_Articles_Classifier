Harpaz | ASSOCIATED PRESS Cape May, N.J., features more than 600 late-19th-century homes and buildings. By Beth J. Harpaz ASSOCIATED PRESS • Sunday July 26, 2015 5:00 AM \nCAPE MAY, N.J. — Summer on the Jersey shore is all about going to the beach. \nWhat makes the seaside town of Cape May special is not only sand and shore but also the city’s many Victorian homes. They constitute what the National Historic Landmarks program calls one of the largest collections of 19th-century frame buildings in the United States. \nThe entire city was designated a National Historic District in 1976, with more than 600 summer homes, hotels and commercial structures in all. Their gables, towers, domes, arched windows and inviting front porches — often trimmed in bright colors — create charming and whimsical streetscapes across town. \nThe Mid-Atlantic Center for the Arts & Humanities, a local nonprofit group, publishes an excellent guide to 57 structures. The “Cape May Bike Tour” booklet can be purchased for $5 at the group’s headquarters on Washington Street. \nIf you don’t want to go around by bike, though, you can also head out on foot and hit many of the homes listed in the booklet in just a few hours. The publication includes a map, street address and description for each structure. \nIn addition to Washington Street, key routes include Ocean Street, Columbia Avenue, Hughes Street, Beach Avenue and North Broadway. Among the highlights are the Stockton Row Cottages on Gurney Street; Leith Hall, the Breakers and Columbia House on Ocean Street; the massive Congress Hall hotel on Beach Avenue; and the Southern Mansion on Washington Street. Many buildings today house bed-and-breakfasts, restaurants or shops. \nIf you have time, take a guided tour of the 1879 Emlen Physick Estate, next to the art center’s offices, with free parking onsite. The tour of 15 restored rooms takes about 45 minutes and offers a good introduction to Cape May’s history and a close-up look at Victorian interiors — including oddities such as decorations made of human hair. You can also buy a combination ticket that covers a guided trolley tour along with admission to the Physick home. \nCape May became a popular summer resort in the mid-1800s, but a massive fire in 1878 destroyed 35 acres, and Atlantic City eventually became a more popular destination. The city’s lack of development in the early 20th century helped preserve it, and the historic landmark designation staved off demolition of the old houses in the late 20th century. \nA pedestrian mall on Washington Street offers ice cream, souvenirs and more. You’ll need to buy a day tag for the beach. Other local attractions include a lighthouse and national wildlife refuge. IF YOU GO Cape May, N.J.
