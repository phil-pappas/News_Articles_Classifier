The new Department of Natural Resources facility is near the Detroit River opposite the William G. Milliken State Park and Harbor. Snyder spoke at Thursday's opening ceremony, with Boy and Girl Scouts and young children among the several hundred participants. Snyder says he got a diverse simulated outdoors experience in half an hour. The three-story, 41,000-square-foot indoor facility features interactive exhibits including a 40-foot-tall artificial tree. It has off-road vehicle, bicycle, kayak, canoe and fishing boat simulators, a life-size beaver lodge, eagle's nest, 3,000-gallon aquarium and 36-foot waterfall. Admission is $5 for adults, $3 for seniors and $3 for children 2-12. Children under 2 enter free. ---", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T03:55:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
