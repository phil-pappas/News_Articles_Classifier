Admittedly, if you’ve replied to your offers and selected a ‘firm’ and ‘insurance’ choice in Ucas Track , then giving yourself a few weeks recuperation isn’t going to do your future any harm. However, if you are applying through Ucas Extra, or are thinking of applying through Clearing , there are a few key dates to bear in mind. • Step-by-step guide to A-level Results Day • Step-by-step guide to Clearing • Step-by-step guide to Adjustment • Download the Telegraph's Clearing app for iPhone and Android July 2 - Ucas Extra deadline If you didn’t receive any university offers – or declined those you did receive – Ucas Extra gives candidates the chance to apply for places on courses that still have vacancies. According to Ucas, some 7,620 people are now studying at university thanks to using Extra last year, and July 2 at 11.59pm is the deadline for applications. If you are eligible to apply through Ucas Extra, it will be available as an option on Track. Search through the courses that have spaces and make sure you double check with admissions at the university in question to make sure they have space, then you can add the choice in Track. Make sure you check back regularly, as if you receive a reply by 16 July you will have to respond by 23 July. July 3 - Ucas Clearing opens After Ucas Extra closes on July 2, the only option for candidates looking to apply to university for a September 2015 start, will be to apply through Ucas Clearing. In order to do so, candidates will need to be in receipt of their results, whether IB or A-level, which means that, for many prospective students, Clearing itself will begin on A-level Results Day on August 13, 2015. For those of you who receive your IB results on July 5, or who took a gap year away from study, Clearing vacancies will be available to view via Ucas’ search tool and via the Telegraph Clearing search from July 6 . Applicants who have their results will be able to apply for courses that have vacancies from this day. You will be notified in Track if you are eligible. As with Extra, make sure you get in touch with your preferred university first to talk through your decision and to double check they have space available. Once you have done this, you should enter the details into Track. Remember that this search tool will only be available until July 27, so make sure you use the time wisely. If you are eligible to apply through Ucas Extra, it will be available on Track July 16 - University decisions If you applied by the final June 30 application deadline, universities will have until today to respond to your application. If they fail to do so, it will automatically be declined and you'll be able to apply through Clearing. If you do receive an offer of a place, you have until July 23 to reply to the offer or it will be declined on your behalf. July 23 - Clearing vacancies removed from the Ucas search tool August 3 - Scottish Clearing vacancies will be displayed in the Ucas search tool August 12 - Clearing vacancy search opens at 6pm August 13 - A-level Results Day The big day has arrived. You will be able to find out from 8am on Track whether you have got into your preferred university or your insurance choice. To get your actually results, you will have to collect them from your school or college, or have pre-arranged an alternative. If you are successful, congratulations; if you have done better than expected you might consider going through Adjustment ; if you fail to meet the requirements of your offer, you’ll be entered into Clearing . You'll be able to enter your choices into Track after 5pm. Vacancies will be listed online from 6pm on August 12 . Or you can search via the Telegraph's Clearing app on iPhone and Android. August 31 - Adjustment closes September 21 - Final deadlines for applications If you want to attend university in 2015, today will be your last day to apply for a place. Applications need to be in by 6pm (UK time) so don’t forget to get those last minute details finalised before the deadline passes. September 30 - Clearing vacancy search closes Deadlines really are coming thick and fast now. Today will be your last opportunity to search for Clearing vacancies using Ucas. After today, you will still be able to apply through Clearing, but you will have to contact the universities themselves if you want to discuss availability. October 21 - Clearing closes Today is your final opportunity to apply through Clearing, and universities will have until today to make their decision whether to accept you or not. It’s important to bear in mind at this point that the majority of university degree courses will have started, so you will have a lot to organise and some catching up to do if you decide to proceed with your application.
