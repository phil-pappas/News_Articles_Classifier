More Hong Kong better English needed \nBy reimporting UK-assembled cars that had previously been exported to Cyprus, Virgin Cars was able to undercut the dealers. You chose a car online, made a payment and picked up your vehicle at an out-of-town garage. \nThe catch? There wasn’t one. When the car alarm went off for no reason, Virgin Cars sent someone around to fix it. And the Honda Civic, still running, if a little chipped and bumped, has not given a moment’s trouble since then. \nSo when it finally dies, will I buy a new car online? No. Virgin Cars is no longer around. Shortly after I bought mine, Sir Richard decided to get out of the business. Only 7,000 people were buying his vehicles annually, compared with hoped-for figures of over 50,000. \nCarwow, which comes after US online sites such as CarsDirect, works differently from Virgin Cars. The company sends your online car preferences to 1,000 dealers, who contact you with their best offers, pay Carwow a commission and then sell to you directly. \nI won’t be using them either. I can no longer see a reason to buy a car. It makes no sense. There are greener, less stressful and cheaper alternatives. \nStart with the stress. In most cities, driving is horrible. It is stop-start, boring and bad-tempered. \nMany people say they drive because they do not like being crushed against other sweaty, disagreeable commuters. I have driven and I have commuted. Fellow passengers are a great deal more civilised than other drivers — and their odours are less offensive than the emissions you inhale in a car. \nIn many cities today, there really is no need for a car. Public transport and walking can get you almost everywhere you need to go. It is healthier and it is greener. In London, I don’t drive for weeks, or sometimes months, at a time. (Others have taken to bicycles. I do not regard them as healthier — certainly not in London.) \nDo not listen to anyone who tells you London’s transport is unreliable. I have taken the Northern Line, London Underground’s supposed “misery line”, twice every working day for 24 years. It lets me down two or three times a year. More video \nCompare that to the hours drivers spent trapped by roadworks, diversions, or other cars. There is nothing convenient about driving. \nIn most European and many Asian and US cities, it is far quicker and easier to get around without a car. There are apps to tell you when the trains and buses are leaving. And there are apps to get you a car when you really need one. \nIn a blog post last year, Kyle Hill , chief executive of HomeHero, which provides carers for the elderly, explained why he had sold his Lexus and decided to do without a car — in Los Angeles. \nHe said he cycled on journeys up to five miles. For anything longer he used Uber. He calculated it was cheaper than running a car, with its purchase payments, interest, depreciation, insurance, petrol, maintenance and taxes. \nAnd do not, he said, forget parking. At a recent dinner in New York, someone told me he paid $500 a month to park in his apartment building. When I expressed astonishment, everyone else chipped in that that was cheap. \nA New York Times article in September said that the average residential parking space in Manhattan cost $136,052 to buy, and that some were selling for up to $1m. A secure underground parking space in Knightsbridge, London cost £350,000, the paper said. \nThose are extreme prices, but all parking is a hassle, as are parking tickets. \nThere may be people who really cannot manage without a car: those who live in the country, for example, where there are no good bus services. \nBut the majority of us are city dwellers, and even in those places without good public transport, there will soon be online taxi services, if there aren’t already. \nSome will say that none of this matters because cars will soon be self-driving. If so, that is another reason not to buy one you have to drive yourself, whether from a dealer or online.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T14:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T23:14:07.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
