Coach Amelie Mauresmo is on her feet, and this is hotting up very nicely indeed. Murray* 4-5 Federer (*denotes next server) In keeping with the ridiculously high quality of this match, Federer kicks off the game with a second serve ace, followed by a first serve ace and a smash winner. Can Andy match that? Well he puts up another perfect lob to reduce the deficit to 40-15. Feds though comes up with yet another ace (he's serving at 86% first serves, which is ludicrous) and Murray now will serve to stay in the set. The winner of the first set in matches between these two has won 17 out of the 23 matches. So the next few games could prove crucial today. Murray 4-4 Federer* (*denotes next server) Federer takes the first point after a pretty long exchange, but Murray takes the second with a blistering backhand crosscourt that tickles the net as it careers into the corner. The next point is just as impressive from Muzza, as he scuttles back off a deep Federer return, and nails a forehand winner. The following one isn't bad either as Murray delivers a perfect backhand pass down the line. It's then game Murray when Fed goes wide with a backhand. Murray* 3-4 Federer (*denotes next server) Crucial seventh game time. Any danger of a break? Well, no. Federer gets to 40-0, but Andy wins the next point with a gorgeous forehand pass. It matters little though as Roger slams down another ace to move ahead. Murray 3-3 Federer* (*denotes next server) Federer looking to impose himself on the Murray serve, but a couple of errors allow Andy to move up to 30-15. There's then a sensational point as Federer hits perfect volley after perfect volley, and eventually breaks Murray down, after the Scot had hit about three perfect attempted passing shots. Half a chance missed for Federer at 30-30 as he steps in to run around a forehand off a weak Murray second serve, but he smashes it into the net. An ace follows that, and we're all square. Murray* 2-3 Federer (*denotes next server) Speaking of serving well, Fed is hitting his spots beautifully, and two aces coupled with two easy volleys secure a love hold. Pretty solid start from both players. Murray 2-2 Federer* (*denotes next server) Murray goes to Federer's forehand when 15-0 up, and the result is inevitable - a crushing winner, and it's back to 15-15. Andy though is serving very well early on, and he reels off the next three points to clinch the hold. Murray* 1-2 Federer (*denotes next server) Federer goes 30-0 up with a huge forehand, but Murray pulls out an outrageous backhand pass down the line and an excellent low return to level at 30-30. The Swiss though responds perfectly, and pulls out a big first serve an ace to move ahead once more. Murray 1-1 Federer* (*denotes next server) Big serving from Murray early on, and an ace takes him to 40-15. He backs that up with another big delivery, and wraps up the game. By the way, update on the crowd situation - pretty even support for both players as we suspected. Update on the commentary - Andy Roddick is such a cut above. Murray* 0-1 Federer (*denotes next server) Feds wins the first two points but a fizzing return and gorgeous lob from Murray have us at 30-30. The Scot then smashes a backhand down the line to go up break point, but Roger saves it with a perfect serve out wide that Murray can't do anything with. Federer's only faced six break points all tournament! That's abusrd. An ace and another big serve follows, and Federer holds. 16.16 Federer to serve. Ready, play... 16.15 Federer of course has lost his serve just once in the tournament (suffice it to say he broke straight back on that occasion), but Murray's return is considerably better than anything Feds has faced thus far. The key for Murray as always will be his first serve percentage, becuase if Federer gets a good look at the Brit's second serve, he could do some serious damage. 16.06 The players are out on court. Here we go, who is going to join Novak Djokovic in Sunday's final? 16.05 Federer has also never lost a Wimbledon semi-final. Murray though is in rock solid form, and has beaten Roger in a major before - the 2013 Australian Open semi-final. 16.00 Last time the two played, Murray won just one game. But hey, let's forget about that. 15.57 This is well worth a read - Greg Rusedski writes in his column that if Murray can play enough to Federer's backhand, he'll come out on top. Greg also reckons that the duller the match, the better for the Brit. From a tactical point of view, Andy Murray fans should actually be hoping for a boring match on Friday. The simpler it is, and the more conventional the rallies are, the more likely Andy is to come out on top. Roger Federer, by contrast, wants to keep the points moving in as a many different directions as possible. He is giving five years away to Andy, so he does not want to be grinding left and right along the baseline all day; if he does, they might as well shake hands at the start of the match. 15.52 All this fortnight we've been working with The Tennis Podcast, and last night they previewed this match, including a prediction from our tennis correspondent Simon Briggs. 15.48 Dennis Brown agrees with me on how tight this is going to be. Too close to call Charlie, wouldn’t like to say, but bring it on And a few more e mails coming in: Matthew Reynolds writes: Murray's consistency this year both in and out of training has been phenomenal, Watching Federer play is phenomenal, his skillset is complimented by his desire to win and confidence in his shots. But on this occasion, Murray for me holds a likeliness to Rocky Balboa- He has the heart to dig deep and bag this one! Scott Chrystal: Fed in straight sets. He is serving unbelievably at the moment 15.45 By way of comparison, here are a couple of videos showing Murray and Federer's career stats. 15.43 Hi everyone, Charlie here. Welcome to this afternoon's live blog of what promises to be a wonderful sporting horrifically tense occasion. Federer has a 12-11 head-to-head winning record over Murray, including their last three matches. But I just can't pick this one, not even a hunch. What do you reckon? Send your thoughts to charlie.eccleshare@telegraph.co.uk or @cdeccleshare 15.33 Djokovic has beaten Gasquet in straight sets, taking less than two and a half hours to do so. He will attempt to defend his title on Sunday against the winner of Andy Murray's match with Roger Federer, which is up next. 15.30 We could be seeing Murray and Federer very soon, with Novak Djokovic on the verge of victory over Richard Gasquet. This lot - up on Murray Mound - are certainly ready. 15.08 It's not just the glory that's on offer for the winner of this year's title - there's rather a lot of cash on the line too. Here's how the Wimbledon prize fund breaks down for the men's and women's singles events (and Murray should feel pretty good about things even if Federer does beat him today)... Singles winners (men and women) Round Prize money % increase Winner £1,880,000 7 Runner-up £940,000 7 Semi-finalists £470,000 7 Quarter-finalists £241,000 7 Fourth round £127,000 9 Third round £77,000 8 Second round £47,000 9 First round £29,000 7 14.50 Novak Djokovic is two sets up against Richard Gasquet now. Murray could be on sooner rather than later... 14.30 I suppose this is confirmation that Alex Ferguson is in the house to support Andy Murray today. He's next to former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry, who he will prefer occupying a seat near him rather than his previous role, occupying his waking nightmares. 14.18 Another chance to vote in our poll on who you want to win this afternoon... 14.09 Who would be best for Murray or Federer to face in a final? Obviously Murray's had his successes against Djokovic in the past, but you wouldn't back anyone against that tennis machine would you? Would Gasquet be a better opponent? Djokovic has one foot in the door of a final, a set ahead against Gasquet . 13.42 I'm sure Andy Murray is paying attention to our live blog of the game between Djokovic and Gasquet today, where Gasquet has rescued an awkward first two games to bring the game to 4-3 to Djokovic. He's currently serving again . 13.20 Amid Murraymania, it's worth remembering that Federer is also popular at the All England Club. #Wimbledon fans out in force to watch #Federer practice on Court No.14 while #Murray hits next to him on No.15 pic.twitter.com/aGlbq2f3Aj — Stuart Appleby (@Stuart_Appleby) July 10, 2015 12.59 There's plenty of chat today about who the Centre Court crowd will be supporting. Logic dictates that the crowd should be all \"ra-ra Andy\" and Union flags, but tennis supporters are a curious lot. Do not be surprised if the purists among the 15,000 or so jammed into the arena today will be rooting for Roger, with all those elegant forehands and imperturbable hair. Our man Luke Brown has been gauging the mood in SW19 - you can read that right here - but in the mean time why don't you tell us who you're planning on backing with our poll: 12.50 While Amitai Winehouse covers Novak Djokovic against Richard Gasquet, the BBC has seemingly decided not to mention it at all on their coverage. The World No. 1 faces off against Gasquet, who has only beaten him once in his career. If we work under the assumption that our podcast predictions are all correct, that's the match to decide who Murray faces in the final. What do they say about overconfidence? Something about a tortoise and a hare? Murray is busy signing autographs as I type. This man's popular... #Wimbledon @andy_murray pic.twitter.com/uXsl0smVcV — Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) July 10, 2015 12.35 Former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson will apparently be in the royal box to support Andy Murray today. I'm sure the umpire will be quaking in his seat. 12.20 Andy Murray? More like Andy Flurry-of-shots-while-he-warms-up. It's a beautiful day for a #Wimbledon semi-final, don't you think @andy_murray ? pic.twitter.com/M84kBu6Ksn — Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) July 10, 2015 All jokes aside, it looks like the Scot has a steely determination about him today, which I've decided based on 18 seconds of warm-up footage. 10.50 As we wait for today's main event, we have some predictions from our team of experts at the Tennis Podcast, and our very own Simon Briggs. And it's good news for Murray! David Law : Murray in 5 Catherine Whitaker : Murray in 4 Simon Briggs : Murray in 4 10.30 Andy Murray's coach Jonas Bjorkman has urged the Scot to fight fire with fire and attack Roger Federer in Friday's Wimbledon semi-final . Bjorkman was brought into Murray's back-room team in March to work with Amelie Mauresmo at adding more variety and aggression to the British number one's game. Murray has thrived under his new sense of freedom , enjoying his best ever clay-court season and stringing together 10 consecutive victories on grass, which included winning a fourth title at Queen's last month. The 28-year-old's fresh attacking blueprint, however, will undergo its stiffest examination yet on Friday, as Murray bids to inflict a first ever defeat on Federer in a Wimbledon semi-final and prevent the 17-time major champion from claiming a record eighth title at the All England Club. Federer has typically played the role of aggressor in previous meetings, with Murray using his speed and guile to counter-punch the Swiss, but Bjorkman believes his the Scot should stick to his guns and attack this time around. \"That will still be the best way, absolutely,\" Bjorkman told Press Association Sport. \"We're trying, Amelie and I, to get him to be more comfortable at the net and be more aggressive. \"That's what he was asking me to come into the team and help out with and it will take some time because at big tournaments it's hard to do that straight away. \"But there's no doubt he has the potential to do it. He has the legs, he's one of the fastest guys out there, he's super strong and he can attack in behind when he's under pressure. \"Even against someone like Roger that is a good way to play. It puts off the guy who wants to come in - he wants to move forward but then all of a sudden he has to go back. \"So definitely, a way to beat someone who is very aggressive is to be very aggressive yourself.\" Andy Murray is relishing the freedom under his new coach Jonas Bjorkman Murray has dropped just two sets on route to the semi-finals this year and Bjorkman insists the shoulder injury that proved problematic in round three is no longer causing the Briton discomfort. \"If he had issues before, it was good in the match and it felt strong today in the warm-up,\" Bjorkman said. \"Andy is playing with tons of confidence right now and he's had a great season, the whole team has done a great job with him. \"He just has to go and prove it. When you get to his fitness level and have the confidence of winning so many matches, you just have to keep going.\" Federer has won the duo's last three meetings, including a 6-0 6-1 demolition at the ATP World Tour Finals in November, but their most recent clash on grass remains Murray's Olympic triumph on Centre Court in 2012. Roger Federer has been untroubled in reaching the Wimbledon semi-finals That victory came just a month after the Swiss had beaten Murray to win Wimbledon and Federer's form at the All England Club this year suggests he may be ready to add another crown. \"I didn't think Roger was going to win another one,\" three-time champion John McEnroe said. \"But every time I watch him play like this, you've got to think, 'Well, of course he's got a chance if you're playing this well'. \"But to beat Murray, and in all likelihood Novak Djokovic, to do that back-to-back, best-of-five, that's a tough situation for Roger. \"So that's why I've picked Murray to win the tournament but it's going to be an incredible match.\" Follow @telegraphsport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T18:49:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
