The total direct economic impact — $5.5 billion— is a result of the 24,395 workers employed in the industry in the state, who earn wages of more than $1 billion. In addition, suppliers contribute another $3 billion and induced economic impact totals $1.6 billion. \"What a lot of people don’t think about when they pick up a beer is the chain of jobs that go into putting that beer in front of them,\" McGreevy said. \"We’re talking not just brewers, but bartenders and barley growers, the farmers and the factory workers.\" Colorado workers are spread across three main sub-sectors of the beer industry: 4,917 in brewing, 2,184 in wholesale and 17,294 in retailing, with brewing workers contributing the most economic output — $4.1 billion. Colorado collected a total of $1.75 billion in business and personal taxes for beer, and another $134 million in consumptions taxes. McGreevy said the tax burden is one of the industry's major challenges. \"Most people probably don’t know that nearly 40 percent of what they pay for a beer at retail goes toward taxes of some kind,\" he said. Nationally, the beer industry is an \"economic powerhouse,\" McGreevy said, largely because it contributes $252.6 billion in economic output, employs 49,576 Americans and generates $48.5 billion in tax revenue. \"While it is always difficult to predict the future, the beer industry will continue to offer Americans a diverse array of choices. There’s a beer for every occasion,\" McGreevy said. \nWant Denver Manufacturing   Business Pulse", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T00:38:16.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
