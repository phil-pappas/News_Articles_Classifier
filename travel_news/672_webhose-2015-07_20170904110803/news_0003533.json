PUBLISHED: 09:55, Tue, Jul 21, 2015 | UPDATED: 10:11, Tue, Jul 21, 2015 GETTY Pastel colored buildings near city center, Havana \nThis was my first salsa dance session and I could not have asked for a more bewitching setting. Stepping out on a palm-studded beach near Trinidad in southern Cuba, I was instantly lost in Latin music. \nI had come to the island with a group of travellers all keen to shimmy too and our trip was one to make the heart of any dirty dancing hopeful skip a beat. \nThe island is the world’s biggest exporter of musical dance styles, especially those that let the hips and booty do the talking. \nRooted in its West African slave and Spanish colonial cultures, its thrilling creations - salsa, rumba, mambo and more - have been pumping out floor fillers for decades. \nBut if a more leisurely sensual charge is your thing then no matter where you go on the island there is sure to be a cobbled plaza where you can soak up a serenade from musicians in old-style zoot suits and nifty straw trilbies while you sip a minty rum cocktail (mojito) under a flame tree’s vermillion blossoms. \nEvery place I visited, from the colourful capital Havana to funky Santiago, catchy melodies, many from The Buena Vista Social Club’s famous repertoire, would rise from rooftops and spill on to streets making me feel I had been catapulted into an enormous concert that I never wanted to end. \nSome of my best hours though were spent on shady terraces mastering moves from maestros. In Cuba take nothing for granted, it is all part of the charm Travel guide \nA few I must say were definitely mangos. That’s local slang for a handsome hunk and once you have seen trees there festooned with the fruity globes you realise what a compliment that is. \nI also became adept at knowing my bongos from my congas and can knock out some mean drum beats now thanks to a percussion masterclass. \nMusic and dancing are reason enough to discover Cuba, but there is now the ‘go before it’s too late’ one too. \nFrozen in a time warp, part Communist Russia part 1950s America, the country that’s like nowhere else is hovering on the cusp of momentous change. \nThe US’s embargo-lifting olive branch to leader Raoul Castro and his 55-year-old revolutionary socialist regime, coupled with steady spread of privately owned businesses, should improve life for its 11 million patient and patriotic citizens. \nBut some fear opening doors will usher in mass-market conformity, and unique Cuba will end up indistinguishable from many other sunny spots. \nFor now though horse and traps ferry children to school along empty, litter-free highways, umbrellas substitute for sun cream and the only advertising remains those immense billboard slogans rousing Cubans to stay on message: United, Vigilant and Combative (Unidos, Vigilantes y Combativos) and Until Victory Always (Hasta la Victoria Siempre). \nIn Havana’s ornate Unesco-protected Old Town residents nap on wooden lattice balconies or chat in the shadows of crumbling Baroque buildings whose enticing open doorways and half-shuttered windows turn visitors into voyeurs in a trice. \nSo blurred is the line between street and home the whole quarter seems just one front room, naturally shabby chic and crammed with period collectibles. \nThe most fun way to get a taste of what life is like with locals is to book into casas particulares (private homes with rented rooms), a long-standing tradition here. \nThe Old Town’s 19th century Hostal Casa Vieja was the plushiest of my trip with mosaic tiled floors, antique rocking chairs and pendant lamps. But it was typical too of my other stays: a spacious air-conditioned room, comfortable bed and ensuite shower with fresh guava or mango juice, omelette and empanadas (small pasties) served for breakfast. \nLovers, lonely hearts, entertainers and families, they all gather to let off steam on the Malecon, 2.4 miles of curving promenade and Havana’s people-watching paradise framed by spectacular Atlantic views. \nPhoto opportunities abound from the candy-coloured convoys of classic American cars to the city panorama from the top floor bar of Ernest Hemingways’s bolt-hole, the art deco Hotel Ambos Mundos. \nI loved pausing for a coconut ice cream break beside the 18th century Plaza Vieja’s graceful porticos and wandering across Revolution Square, a stern concrete plain dominated by a towering sculpture of Cuba’s favourite poster boy and national hero guerrilla Ernesto ‘Che’ Guevara. \nA fine spread of pumpkin soup, seafood paella, slow roasted beef and the staple rice and beans in a paladar (Cuban private restaurants specialising in home cooking) followed by a couple of Havana Specials (white rum, maraschino liqueur and pineapple juice) set us up for a big night. \nThere is no better way to get into the swing of Cuba than to catch the Buena Vista orchestra and its dazzling salsa floor show. To see performers at the top of their game we took ringside seats in the Havana Café, a cavernous night spot oozing retro glamour with vintage classic cars and bi-plane suspended from the ceiling. Michael Sadowski/Intrepid Travel The view from a rooftop in Cuba \n“In Cuba take nothing for granted, it is all part of the charm,” was the wry advice from our Intrepid Travel guide Tony whose immense knowledge made all the difference as we drove south down deserted highways past the hulking skeletons of failed factories and oxen-ploughed fields of sugar, rice and cassava, to Trinidad. \nThe city is Cuba’s best preserved colonial jewel, a Caribbean fiesta of coral, turquoise and sunshine yellow facades where the chants of melon sellers rouse travellers from their rest and dapper old chaps, with hair cuts sharper than any Premier League striker’s, pose with giant cigars. \nIt was on nearby Ancon beach that I had my seminal Latin dance moment followed next day by a rewarding formal lesson in the House of Salsa’s flower-decked courtyard. \nThat cracked it, my worries about having legs of cement were over and I began my new era that night on the alfresco stone terraces of the Casa de la Musica, with partners from our group of travellers, many polished performers but some, phew, at the breakthrough stage too. \nThe dancing continued, watching this time, at our next stop Camaguey, nicknamed the Corinth of the Caribbean for its classic architecture, home of distinctive tinajon clay water jars and the country’s ballet capital. \nThe city has another treasure too, the Plaza del Carmen arts quarter featuring street sculptures of townsfolk and the fantastical paintings of Martha Jimenez whose works depicting ordinary women display a sometimes less celebrated side of Cuban life. \nBy the time we got to Santiago, the island’s carnival capital and musical sweet spot, our twinkle toes were itching again and there were no shortage of top partners. \nAt first I suspected there were a lot of porkies being told when so many locals introduced themselves as salsa teachers. But it turned out to be true because of major restoration work that has temporarily closed some venues. \nThe legendary Casa de la Trova was open though and treated us to some soothing boleros before we headed for a funky late night live band session at Artex La Claqueta, an alfresco bistro and dance club popular with locals.
