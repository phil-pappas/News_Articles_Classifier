Las Vegas, NV, July 09, 2015 --( PR.com )-- When it comes to Christmas vacation or holiday tour, it’s always recommended by leading hoteliers to book the hotel rooms earlier to avoid the last minute holidays plan change due to non-availability of hotels accommodation and expensive stay. So to take advantage of the situation, generally the last minute hotel bookings tend to be more expensive, and sometimes the off-season normal hotel rates become the last minute hotel deals for travelers' lodging. Having this, Travoline.com, a leading online travel booking portal, has announced that travelers and vacation planners should book hotels early for this Christmas and New Years Eve 2016.Not everyone loves to stay at home during the holidays and instead would love to travel. Let it be a Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas or New Year Holiday, people love to travel at least to their nearest travel destination to spend time together with friends and family. Few tend to plan their travel six months in advance, few during the last minute and few would have decided in the previous year, but still they wait to book their flights and hotels just before ten days expecting a last minute discount sale, if not available that makes them pay higher than it should be. To save costs and be worry-free, travelers who have planned their travel already, could compare prices and book their hotels right away online.There are hotels that have the best Christmas decorations year on year to attract the Christmas travelers. As per study this year more number of travelers are expected to travel to London in the United Kingdom, Illinois, Nevada, Florida, California, New York and Texas in the United States.Apart from this, most travelers reserve their weekend hotels in Montreal, Las Vegas, New Orleans and Paris. So these locations are expected to experience higher volume of leisure traveler’s during the Christmas and New Year. Notably, the year 2016 begins on a Friday, which is going provide a double treat to the travelers eventually proving a weekend as well a New Year mood.“Lodging is one which is equally important like booking the flights. The rates may tend to go high during the weekends and season times. So it’s wise to reserve the hotels prior to some four months to get the ultimate discounted rates,” said Ms. Nishanthi, Managing Director of Travoline. “Last year there were hundreds of enquiries received from the travelers at the last minute. Though Travoline was able to address the maximum and make some arrangements, but still few reservations were declined due to non-availability of hotel rooms. So this year, in order to get our customers the best hotels rooms, we opened the online hotel reservations for the month of December earlier this year, whilst we continue to offer the discount sale month-on-month from July. By reserving the hotel at the earliest one can get up to 60% savings on the hotel rooms if reserved for futures dates,” she added.Most of the Christmas Markets begin from the month of October in major cities in the USA and UK. While you reserve the hotel, you can check if there is any Christmas and New Year program planned for the year, so its gives an opportunity to have excitement, fun and relaxation from routine stress.For General Weekend and Christmas Hotel Bookings Discount and Deals, visit bookings.travoline.com Contact Information Travoline Travel Services Pvt LtdMohana Jai", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T16:26:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
