In March, Uber stood at 47% and taxis at 52% (see chart below). Uber displaced taxis in April. The shift in the last year has been stunning. Uber accounted for just 14% of the business-related market share in June 2014 and taxis 86%. Lyft has gone from a rounding error a year ago to 1% by August 2014 and 2% in June. \nU.S. Market Share of Business-Related Ground Transportation \nCourtesy of Certify. \nThe biggest share gains for Uber occurred in New York City, with market share rising more than 10 percentage points, to 31.3% in the second quarter from 21% in the first (see chart below). \nCity Market Share Changes for Business-Related Ground Transportation, First Quarter to Second Quarter, 2015 \nCourtesy of Certify.
