Sixty of RealNetworks’ employees will leave to join Gaming Realms, and 15 other employees are being laid off.\nRealNetworks’ stock ticked upward after the news was announced Friday, closing at $4.90, up 14 cents, or nearly 3 percent.\nThe company, headquartered in Seattle’s Sodo neighborhood, is best known for creating the hit RealPlayer media player in the 1990s, but business has been suffering in recent years as the online-streaming-services market becomes ever more crowded. RealNetworks cut its staff several times from its peak of 1,700 employees in 2008; it had 769 employees at the end of 2014.\nMost Read Stories Video from bus driver’s body camera could cost 2 deputies their jobs Donnie Chin, Chinatown ID's 'frontline hero,' killed in early morning shooting Time for Mariners to face reality as trade deadline nears 2 killed in drive-by shooting on I-5 in Mount Vernon Lifestyle changes may guard aging brain against memory loss The company has had a hard time regaining its former status and finding a specific niche in the media industry. Founder Rob Glaser retook the CEO reins in 2013 with a plan to aggressively reinvent the company, focusing on three main areas: games, cloud services and mobile entertainment.\nIn a May filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said the new products “have not generated significant revenue” in the first quarter. The company reported a $25.5 million loss on $30.6 million in revenue from that quarter. Revenue has declined 74 percent since 2008.\nGlaser remains optimistic. These types of company overhauls take time, he said in an interview in May.\n“I agree that if you just look at the headlines, the headlines would be very negative. But we know what we’re doing,” he said.\nFilings from the past three years show that cash flow has been a decreasing, and the $18 million sale will likely add a needed surge. The company reported about $103 million in cash on hand at the end of its first quarter this year.\nIn May, RealNetworks introduced RealTimes, a service that makes automatic photo and video montages — its latest attempt to reel in more users.\n“We are in the process of going from being a caterpillar to a butterfly, I guess I would say,” Glaser said.\nIn a news release announcing the sale, RealNetworks reiterated its commitment to the casual gaming business.\n“We are deriving value from our Slingo and Social Casino business; we are pairing this team and business with an excellent partner in Gaming Realms who will leverage our great Slingo and casino assets into real money gaming; and we are redoubling our focus on our traditional casual games business which we believe is financially stable and poised for success,” Glaser said in a statement.\nThe company is scheduled to report second-quarter results after the market closes on Aug. 5.\nRachel Lerman : rlerman@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @rachelerman .
