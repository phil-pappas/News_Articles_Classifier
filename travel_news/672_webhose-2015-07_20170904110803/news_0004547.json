I don’t know what I will do with all of these blessings,” the stunned 42-year-old grocery store employee and domestic helper said.\n“Now, Daniel will not have to suffer just to finish his studies.”\nThe photo, posted on Facebook last month by a college student, showed Danieldoing his homework on a wooden stool placed close to a McDonald’s window to catch the light from the store.\nDedicated ...

She augments the income by selling cigarettes and candy on the streets on Mandaue, an urban centre on Cebu island in the central Philippines.\nTheir grocery store home is close to the McDonald’s outlet that had served as Daniel’s study nook, she said.\nScholarship ...

I want to reach my dreams’.”\nMs Espinosa said, aside from the cash, school supplies and scholarship offers that would guarantee his education through college, people had given school uniforms and a reading lamp.\nThe local church and government social welfare office had also received aid on his behalf.\n“Our problem is how to manage all this financial assistance,” the city’s social welfare office chief, Violeta Cavada, said.\n“He has become a symbol of poor slum boys in the city who can’t study because they don’t have electricity.”\nStudying hard ...

Picture: AFP Source: AFP\nDespite strong economic growth in recent years, roughly one quarter of the Philippines’ 100 million people still live on less than one dollar a day, and giant slums dominate all major cities.\nMs Torrefranca’s post was shared around the world and in multiple languages, including Spanish, German and Portuguese, all touched by the boy’s perseverance.\n“I couldn’t believe how my post went viral and helped him in his studies,” Ms Torrefranca said.\nShe said she snapped a photo of the boy, whom she saw outside the fast food chain for the first time, while she was on her way home from school.\n“I was in awe. While other streetkids were begging for alms, he was studying.”\nMany who reposted Daniel’s photo on their Facebook profiles agreed.\n“I hope he makes it because in my book, he is a legend,” Alan Butler said on his Facebook page.\n“Great story because thanks to this picture, his life will change. Sad, because it is one of the thousands, probably millions who live in these circumstances,” wrote Christoffel Sneijders.\nOriginally published as Studious boy’s dreams to come true", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227437/627261-16ac94fe-270a-11e5-9249-f9ea34ff76a1.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227437/627287-1a2196d4-270a-11e5-9249-f9ea34ff76a1.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227437/628027-123cbeda-270a-11e5-9249-f9ea34ff76a1.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/daniel-cabrera-who-studies-under-a-mcdonalds-light-to-become-policeman-after-kindness-of-strangers/story-fnq2o7hp-1227437628081"], "published": "2015-07-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T22:22:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
