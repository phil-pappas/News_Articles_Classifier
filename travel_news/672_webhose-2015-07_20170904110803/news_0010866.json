Others offer a sprinkling of stardust by providing a chance to rub shoulders with world-famous racing drivers and celebrity car lovers. Still others allow members of the public to get up-close and personal with some of the world’s fastest automobiles. And a few deliver the thrill of broken records, breathtaking stunts and cutting-edge cars. Not many offer all of these things at once, however. Which is what makes the Goodwood Festival of Speed so distinctive. It combines the best of everything, ensuring a petrol head’s paradise in the heart of Sussex. And the 2015 event, held from June 25-28, very much lived up to expectations. Terry Grant set the record for the fastest-ever mile completed on two wheels The presence of motorsport heroes such as Valentino Rossi, Jenson Button and Nico Rosberg helped jolly things along, of course. But while festival-goers were undoubtedly thrilled to see these icons in the flesh, it was the high-performance vehicles on display that really stole the show. In the Michelin Supercar Paddock, for example, visitors had the chance to view an array of million-pound motors, including the Koenigsegg Regera, Ferrari 488 GTB and the Aston Martin Vulcan. Even better, once their spoilers and super-chargers had been salivated over by eager enthusiasts, the cars were taken for a spin around Goodwood’s famous 1.16-mile hillclimb. This allowed them to show off their high-performance abilities, provoking amazement and delight from spectators. Strangely, though, it was a Nissan Juke that caused one of the biggest stirs of the weekend. This was driven around the hillclimb by stunt driver Terry Grant, who set the record for the fastest-ever mile completed on two wheels, in just two mins 10 secs. Switching lanes: Valentino Rossi prepares to take part in the famous Hill Climb That’s right: two wheels. Meaning that Grant had to show considerable calm in piloting his steed, in order to keep it finely balanced while also travelling as quickly as he dared. The stuntman’s achievement is a microcosm of what Goodwood is all about: showing how man (or woman) and machine can work together to achieve ever-greater feats. This theme was picked up by Michelin, which used the festival to showcase its enviable achievements in competitive motorsport, including Formula 1, the World Rally Championship and MotoGP. In addition, the company showed how its work in motorsport carries over to its product range, ensuring everyday motorists benefit from the technology developed on the race track. Such technology includes the trademark Twaron Belt that enhances stability at speed, and Bi-Compound construction to enhance grip around corners. The 2015 Goodwood Festival of Speed was a chance to see the impact of all such innovations at first hand. More than that, it was a celebration of all things automotive. And, as anyone who attended will tell you, it was quite possibly the best motor show on earth.
