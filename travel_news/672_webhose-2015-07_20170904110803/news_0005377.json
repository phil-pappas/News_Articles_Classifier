Ibiza is packed full of energy.\nWhere are the liveliest parties in Ibiza?\nFor me, it doesn't matter where you play in the world, when you are playing to a crowd that loves their music it can be the best party on earth, right there and then. I'm playing Eden Friday 17th July and Friday 7th August this year for Judgement Fridays with Judge Jules. But I have a soft spot for Ibiza, for the clubs and the other DJs too.\nThere are the clubs that everyone should experience in Ibiza such as Ushuaia , Pacha, Space, DC10, Glitterbox and Amnesia.\n Is THIS the world's best hotel? Inside India's... Passenger's fury after being charged £20 to retrieve his... British Airways set to take over Aer Lingus after Ryanair... Where do the sexiest people go?\nAll over Ibiza, it's a beautiful place that brings beautiful people, Blue Marlin, Nassau and The Jockey Club are great places to go and people watch.\nWhere can the best music be found?\nI will most definitely be saying Eden this year as it is where I will be DJ-ing! I will also be supporting my fellow KISS FM DJS Tough Love who are the hottest DJs this year and are playing every Thursday at Sankey’s Soap.\nWhat's the best bar?\nI love the Blue Marlin, it's a beautiful private beach with an amazing bar, beach beds and also has the best sushi if you fancy a snack. It’s also full of beautiful people so you can do more people watching!\nBest bar that no one knows about\nLook out for secret cave parties, these get put on sometimes and are amazing, literally in a cave, music and drinks until the following day. You have to ask around for details as they are very hush hush.\nYachter's delight: Sailboats and celebrity yachts can be found basking in the secluded coves of Ibiza's shoreline\nEndless revelry: With a host of clubs to choose from, visitors can party the day and night away in Ibiza (left) DJ Charlie Hedges (right)\nWhat's your favourite club?\nEden on Fridays and Ushuaia for early evenings.\nBest place to chill out after the partying stops?\nOn the beach watching the sun come up, or if you're doing Ibiza the right way the sun should have already come up, so you are just sleeping on the beach!\nBest place for food?\nTropicana Ibiza club which is right on the beach in San Jose, there are loads of great restaurants at the Amante and Nassau beach club.\nSun worship: Drenched in Mediterranean sun, intrepid tourists can explore the Es Cavallet coastline\nLounge lovers:The rich and famous while away their days at hotel, spa and restaurant Atzaro (above) says Hedges\nWhich clubs should you dress to impress at?\nI like to make an effort wherever I play but it also depends on where you are going I guess. Come dressed to impress but be comfortable as you can as you don't want your shoes stopping you from lasting all night.\nFor girls, a dress or evening shorts and some flat sandals or wedges is a good choice. At Ushuaia for day-time to early evening, you can experiment with your wardrobe as it has a half pool party vibe and half dressing up dress code.\nWhat are the essentials items you shouldn't fly to the White Isle without?\nFor me it’s my music and headphones, some dry shampoo, fold up flat shoes to change into from heels and a hairband.\nWhat should you pack if you're visiting Ibiza for the first time?\nSunscreen, flip flops, shorts, vest tops and bikinis, you can definitely travel light and just mix and match outfits.\nClever accessories can take you from beach to night time, just throw on a necklace and add some sandals to transform a shorts and vest top outfit for the clubs. For those who are extra brave, your swimwear can also double as a top teamed with shorts or a skirt.\nDazzling epicentre: Beautiful people flock to Ibiza's old Mediterranean streets to find local charm as well as world famous clubs\nBalearic's best: Ibiza is divided into the old town and the upper town offering two contrasting travel experiences\nWhat’s Ibiza's upper age limit?\nI honestly think there is no age limit when it comes to loving music, that's the beautiful thing about Ibiza, whatever age you are there's a place for everyone and everyone gets along, as we all have one thing in common and that's the music.\nI played with Carl Cox last year and his friends had their grandparents there. It was really sweet, I’d love my mum and dad to come out to Ibiza to watch me play one year, we've already talked about it.\nThe great thing about Ibiza is that there is something for every age and price range. You can go there to just relax and try out the amazing spas and yoga retreats on the island, or you can go there to party!\nWhat are the most bizarre sights you’ve seen in Ibiza?\nSeeing top DJ Steve Aoki throwing at full force a massive cake in someone's face at his gig in Pacha which I played at last year - it was brilliant!\nTips for saving money\nBuy drinks between a group of friends for your hotel room so you can have a few in the daytime or before you go out which will save you spending more cash. Drinks are really expensive in Ibiza including water!\nDaylight recovery: The jet set flock to Atzaro (left) to revive their party weary bodies. Ibiza offers a quality gastro scene (right)\nKISS FM DJ CHARLIE HEDGES' IBIZA HOTLIST Hottest DJ set\nSankey’s Soap in Ibiza\nWhere to enjoy food fit for a king\nThe Beach house - this hot new spot has just opened and is the latest project by Ibiza restaurateurs Jonathan Thorogood and Olivia Fleury.
