Food is a crucial ingredient to the cultures of both countries, and it was one of the reasons Italy’s top envoy to Beijing believed China would take centre stage at the Milan Expo. “Food means a lot to China. It has a huge population, and the Chinese government has a great responsibility to feed a large number of people,” Alberto Bradanini, the Italian ambassador to China, said in an interview with China Daily . “Chinese and Italian families devote a lot of time every day to food preparation. There are few countries like us,\" he said. \"Both countries have a long food history, and a long list of delicacies. So we can share our traditions. Mr Bradanini, who has lived in Beijing off and on for nine years, spoke highly of China’s achievement in feeding its 1.3 billion people and lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty. However, he did not hide his concern over the quality of food produced and consumed in the country. “China has achieved great success in economic growth, the government must be proud of that,” he said. “But the cost is pollution — pollution not only in the air we breathe, but also in the soil and the water. Unfortunately, food is produced in some places where the soil and water are polluted.” He said the Chinese government was highly committed to investing money, technology and other resources to reduce pollution in the soil and water, but it would take time. To prevent Chinese visitors falling prey to pickpockets, Italy mooted the idea of inviting Chinese police officers to patrol the streets The Milan Expo, which runs until October 31, “is a unique opportunity” for the country to show how it would address this issue, he said. “For six months, you can show your capabilities in three pavilions, maybe four or five,” Mr Bradanini said, referring to the China Pavilion, the China Corporate United Pavilion, and Chinese property company Vanke’s pavilion. Many provincial governments and companies in China had applied to take part in the Milan Expo to showcase their technologies and innovation and meet their Italian counterparts, and the ambassador said he was fairly confident that business opportunities would be developed and deals would be done. “This very much depends on good ideas we should implement to organise good events, lectures and conferences on specific areas, not only food, but everything related to food,\" he said, such as packaging, the use of robots in production, and agricultural machinery. As the China Pavillion is the second-largest foreign pavilion at the expo, with hundreds of companies seeking to show and share innovations with foreign enterprises, China is sure to be in the spotlight. The Milan Expo also offers Chinese people another reason to book a flight to this Mediterranean country, in addition to its already popular fine arts, ancient buildings, and traditional cuisine. “The Chinese love Italy because of its art, food, fashion, design and scenery,” Mr Bradanini said, adding that he expected the expo to attract up to 25 million visitors, including 1.5 million Chinese who either would fly in from China or travel from other European countries within the Schengen visa area. Chinese people had purchased roughly one in every nine tickets sold before May 1, according to the ambassador, who estimated that most Chinese who go to Europe during the expo would visit Milan. Airlines in China and Italy have announced that they have increased flights to meet the ballooning demand in travel between the two countries. Air China has launched daily direct flights from Shanghai and Beijing to Milan, and Alitalia Airlines said it is operating a Shanghai-Milan service throughout the expo. Mr Bradanini said workers at the Italian embassy in Beijing were attempting to ensure individual Chinese travellers received visas within two days. To prevent Chinese visitors falling prey to pickpockets and robbers, Italy had also mooted the idea of inviting Chinese police officers to patrol the streets with Milanese officers, focusing on areas with a high crime rate or a high concentration of Chinese tourists. The two countries have discussed joint patrols for a while and were close to signing an agreement, the ambassador said. “We heard that in some European countries Chinese people have been attacked, so we asked the Chinese authorities to send police officers to Italy,” he said. “They can work with the Italian police to protect Chinese. This will enhance law enforcement to prevent this kind of incident.” This article was originally produced and published by China Daily.
