Dale Keller, chief executive of BAR UK said “The Government now needs to evaluate the independent findings of the Airports Commission and to expediently act upon their recommendations. Now is the time for everyone, including politicians of all parties, to pull together in the national interest and support the bold plans to expand and improve airport infrastructure at Heathrow in order to maintain the UK’s position as Europe’s most important aviation hub \n“Since the major cost of funding the expansion will ultimately be borne by passengers, it is essential that the final scheme is viable and cost-effective for future generations and does not burden today’s passengers with excessive airport charges.” BAR UK airlines will work closely with Government to achieve the best possible solution for the UK’s future air passenger and cargo needs. Mark Tanzer, ABTA Chief Executive commented, “ABTA welcomes today’s announcement by the Airports Commission that Heathrow Airport should be allowed to build a third runway. Increasing airport capacity is essential to the UK’s growth and global competitiveness; we are pleased that this recommendation has been arrived at through fair, transparent, and thorough processes and consultations. “Today’s announcement is the first step towards the delivery of urgently needed capacity at the UK’s hub airport and we now look forward to the Government’s response. We call on Government to work across party boundaries and create a robust political consensus which will deliver this recommendation for UK businesses, and passengers. ABTA will be working with the Government, as well as the opposition front benches to help build consensus.” Ufi Ibrahim, chief executive of The British Hospitality Association, speaking at yesterday's 2015 Hospitality & Tourism Summit said: \"We have run out of time for further debate on where we increase our airport capacity, a vital component to sustaining the growth the hospitality and tourism industry is contributing to the UK economy. Politics has delayed this decision for long enough and now we call on the Government to take decisive action and tell us when construction will begin to build additional runway capacity.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T13:41:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
