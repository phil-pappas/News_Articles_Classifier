Before now, I could only imagine the fear that Patrick McGoohan's character in The Prisoner felt at seeing a giant inflatable ball bouncing towards him. However, after my experience with zorbing I know that fear all too well. Instead of coming to whisk me off to prison (as was the case in the Sixties spy thriller series), this ball was coming to roll me down a steep hill at terrifying speed. As it approached, I wasn’t quite sure which outcome was preferable. It probably goes without saying that thrill-seeking activities aren’t exactly my thing. My wife, on the other hand, loves them – which is why I should have been more suspicious when she casually suggested we try zorbing sometime. Instead of enquiring as to what is actually involved in zorbing, I just naively nodded along. Before I knew it she had signed us up for a Saturday session at Go Zorbing in Surrey . Go Zorbing in Surrey offers two rides: harness zorbing and hydro zorbing Upon arrival at Go Zorbing, the friendly staff explained the process and described the two flavours of impending doom (my words, not theirs): harness ride and hydro ride. My loving wife had signed us up for both. We got changed and made our way up the launching pad. As I watched other duos take their turns down the hill, I grew increasingly nervous. Just ahead of us, a group of rambunctious 9-year-old boys were laughing hysterically as they geared up for their second ride. Perhaps noticing my worried expression, one of them said: “Don’t worry, you’re going to love it. It’s so fun!” With the slightly embarrassing encouragement of a child fuelling me on, I braced myself and prepared to enter the zorb. First up: the harness ride. We were strapped securely to the inside of the zorb, facing each other, and fitted with GoPro cameras to record our expressions of terror as we rolled down. Because you’re fixed to the wall of the zorb, you flip upside-down as you roll. It’s a bit like being on a rollercoaster, but even scarier because it feels like the giant ball could just speed off into the surrounding forest at any time. I screamed my head off as we barrelled down. When our zorb was caught by the net at the end of the hill, it felt like we were veering off course. At this point I started to yell: “No, not good! Not good! Not good!” (Much to the delight of my wife.) When we finally came to a stop and I realised we were safe, I started laughing. Despite my cowardly shrieks, I had to admit – that was pretty fun. Busted: Paul's terror was a source of great amusement for his wife We climbed awkwardly out of the zorb and took a seat to catch our breath and allow our heart rates to return to normal. “Are you ready for the next one?” my wife asked. I surprised myself by quickly answering: “Sure, why not?” I figured the worst had to be over. And I was right. For the hydro ride, we were sat next each other in the zorb, arms linked, with no harnesses. They filled the ball with a few inches of water and then sealed us in. The water made our bodies slip around so the zorb rolled around us – which meant no flipping! This ride was a bit more tame and a lot more fun. However, when we hit the net at the end we were both airborne for a second before face-planting in the water: a hilarious moment we continuously replayed on the video once we got home. As I left the park with all my limbs intact, I realised that I had enjoyed myself much more than I expected. After you get over the initial terror, zorbing really is a fun activity – for thrill-seeking children, annoyingly brave wives and, yes, even overly cautious, safety-obsessed husbands.
