Aimed at both leisure and business travellers alike, Bath Mill is the perfect destination to unwind after a busy day sightseeing or following a hectic day at the office. \nBath Mill is located on the western edge of Bath and features beautifully landscaped grounds surrounded by woodland. It will also offer a brand new Bar and Bistro, The Brook, where guests and non-residents can enjoy a range of mouth-watering meals either inside or on the extensive outdoor terrace. The Brook will also offer conference and events space. Bath Mill will bring a totally new type of accommodation to Bath, offering studio and two, three and four bedroom lodges which will provide an enticing and spacious alternative to Bath’s more conventional hotels and guest houses. “Not only will we be welcoming tourists and holidaymakers, but we will be working hard to attract business travellers who are looking for a home-from-home experience with a luxury hotel feel. We will also be looking to raise our profile as a venue for conferences, functions and events, making it a highly valuable new addition for the Bath area.” Offering guests a city break in a tranquil and relaxing location, less than three miles away from Bath’s historic city centre, guests can choose from a range of lodges fitted with all the mod cons that you might need when self catering, whilst offering the luxury of a five star hotel room. All accommodation is double glazed and centrally heated, and each lodge features a private decking area with patio furniture. Inside, the lodges feature Wi-Fi, a Bluetooth docking station, a kitchen including a microwave, dishwasher, fridge/freezer and washing machine*, a bath and/or shower and flat screen TVs. In addition, guests are provided with sumptuous bed linen, duvets and towels, use of bathrobes and slippers and a selection of premium toiletries. Tea, coffee, hot chocolate and a kitchen welcome pack are also provided. Gas, electricity and Wi-Fi are all included in the cost of the stay. Onsite facilities also include a small gymnasium and children’s play area. The opening of Bath Mill marks an exciting time for operator Darwin Escapes, which has opened a number of brand new luxury holiday destinations in recent years and now offers 14 resorts, retreats and holiday parks located around the UK, including Cheddar Woods in Somerset, Piran Meadows in Cornwall and Beach Cove in Devon.
