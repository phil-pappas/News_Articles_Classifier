The flights are doing \"surprisingly well,\" said Joel Chusid, Hainan Airlines executive director for the U.S. \n\"So far, we haven't seen any (decline)\" due to the market downturn, Chusid said. \"But ask me in November.\" \nMust Read: Boeing 767 Past Its Prime? Just Don't Tell United Airlines or FedEx \nHainan's growth is just a small piece of the rapid increase in airline capacity between China and North America. \"The frequency of flights between the U.S. and China has more than doubled in the past five years,\" said Katherine Wellman, vice president of product management at aviation information company OAG. \nBetween 2010 and 2015, the number of airline seats between the U.S. and China grew by 119% to 7.5 million, while the number of annual frequencies grew by 133% to 25,931, according to statistics compiled for TheStreet by OAG. Throughout the period, the number of seats and frequencies operated by U.S. and Chinese carriers has been nearly equivalent. \nLooking ahead, a survey released Monday by the Global Business Travel Association forecasts that China business travel will account for $420 billion in spending in 2019, up 41% from the 2014 level. \nThis week, two airline deals have been announced. Delta ( DAL - Get Report ) said it will pay $450 million to buy 3.5% of the shares of Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines . Delta is the first U.S. carrier to invest in a Chinese airline. Additionally, Hainan and Alaska ( ALK - Get Report ) signed a frequent-flier partnership, linking Alaska flights with Hainan flights to Beijing and Shanghai. \n\"We feed Alaska a few hundred passengers a day, while Alaska feeds a similar number to Hainan,\" Chusid said. \n\"Passengers have been asking for this for a long time,\" he added. \"It benefits both airlines.\" 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:16:00.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
