Adv: \nSeychelles President James Michel has extended his sincerest condolences to the government and people of India following the passing of Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, former President of the Republic of India. \n“Dr. Abdul Kalam was an inspirational leader, a top innovator, a talented teacher and an individual who very naturally captured the hearts and respect of the people of India and the international community as a whole, including that of the Seychellois people,” said President Michel in a letter to the Indian President, Pranab Mukherjee. \nThe President said that the passing of Dr. Abdul Kalam is a great loss to the world and that he leaves behind a powerful legacy, having taken his country to great heights during his tenure, and paving the way for the creation of a modern and prosperous India. \n“Considered a great and sincere friend to Seychelles, he will be sorely missed. I will always remember fondly the close and meaningful discussions held with him during my State Visit to India in 2005, during which we both acknowledged the special and unwavering friendship between our two nations – bonded together by our shared space, the Indian Ocean, as well as our shared historical and cultural roots. We will always remain grateful to former President Abdul Kalam’s strong conviction in the future of Seychelles-India relations and his commitment to furthering the powerful bonds between our two countries.” \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
