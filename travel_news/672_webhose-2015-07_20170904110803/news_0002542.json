Photo by Benet J. Wilson As travelers carry more data hogging electronic devices, airports are straining to keep up with the demand. Seattle-based RootMetrics did the heavy lifting , testing data performance -- on providers AT&T , Sprint , TMobile and Verizon -- including internet browsing, upload and download speeds, and email, at the 50 U.S. airports with the most traffic, based on Federal Aviation Administration enplanement figures .\nRootMetrics’ report found that Verizon, the largest carrier, had the best overall performance in the 50 airports, followed by T-Mobile, AT&T and Sprint. The five airports with the best overall data connectivity were Memphis International , Pittsburgh International , Chicago O'Hare International , Southwest Florida International and Dallas Love Field .\nRounding out the bottom five were San Francisco International , Nashville International , Miami International , Philadelphia International , Honolulu International and San Diego International airports.\nMemphis International moved into the top spot from number four, trading positions with Southwest Florida International Airport in Fort Myers, Florida. “Memphis’s rise was no doubt helped by the fact that all four networks had faster speeds at Memphis International in our latest round of testing than last time,” said the report.\nDallas Love Field rocketed up to number five from number 40 in the latest rankings, “perhaps aided by vast improvement in Sprint’s speeds,” said the report.\nAnd Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Washington, D.C., fell from number seven to number 29, with all four networks posting speed decreases at the airport compared to previous testing.\n“If you do a lot of traveling, chances are you will be heading through some of the busiest U.S. hubs sooner or later,” said the report. “These big airports face even more potential congestion issues due to higher traffic.”\nThat makes the high-performance ranking of Chicago’s O’Hare and Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson airports that much more impressive, said the report. “O’Hare was third in our performance ranking and Hartsfield-Jackson was seventh despite being the third and first, respectively, busiest airports in the U.S., according to the 2013 Federal Aviation Administration data,” it added.\n“On the other hand, Los Angeles International Airport , which ranks number two in traffic, was far down on our list, landing at number 42 out of the 50 airports in performance,” said the report. “ Dallas-Fort Worth International, the fourth-busiest U.S. airport, ranked at number 37, and Denver International , number five in terms of traffic, came in at number 39.”\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.flychicago.com/ohare/en/home/", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/L/S/M/16675267701_78852594a6_k.jpg", "http://www.miami-airport.com/", "http://www.flydenver.com/", "http://www.faa.gov/airports/planning_capacity/passenger_allcargo_stats/passenger/", "http://www.lawa.org/welcomeLAX.aspx", "http://www.pitairport.com/", "http://www.sprint.com/mysprint/pages/sl/global/index.jsp?context&#61;CP", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/S/M/16675267701_78852594a6_k.jpg", "http://www.dallas-lovefield.com/", "http://hawaii.gov/hnl", "http://www.att.com/shop/wireless.html", "http://www.metwashairports.com/reagan/reagan.htm", "http://www.phl.org/", "http://www.t-mobile.com/", "http://www.flynashville.com/", "http://www.flylcpa.com/", "http://www.flysfo.com/", "http://www.rootmetrics.com/us", "http://www.san.org/", "http://www.verizonwireless.com/", "https://www.dfwairport.com/"], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T18:29:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
