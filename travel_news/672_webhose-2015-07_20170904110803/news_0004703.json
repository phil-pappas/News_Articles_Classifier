Both new recruits bring a wealth of experience and specialist knowledge in the travel industry to Tuxedo’s offering. \nTuxedo is already an established player within the travel sector as it has continued to tap into a highly lucrative market; the predicted turnover for prepaid cards in the UK is expected to reach €3.3billion by the end of 2015. As the business turns its attention to more aggressive business growth globally, it is investing heavily in its team. Joanne joins the company with over 22 years’ experience working within the travel sector and over 15 of those years in a managerial position. She previously worked for The Global Travel Group as sales and business development manager covering the south of the UK. Prior to that she was a manager at Dawson and Sanderson for numerous years, developing her expertise in travel. Meanwhile, Drew has six years’ experience in senior roles, including overseeing relations between global software vendor, Flexera Software Inc., and its vast network of channel partners. Working closely with Tuxedo’s key accounts, Joanne will manage the sales and marketing of the Escape Travel Card, which was developed in conjunction with IDT Financial Services Limited. Escape is a new B2B2C currency card on the MasterCard® network and has been developed to offer partners a prepaid product that provides an ancillary revenue stream. Joanne’s responsibilities will include training staff on using and selling Escape as well as liaising with the management teams to implement promotional activity and ways to maximise the benefits of the programme. Joanne will also liaise with prospective and new clients within the travel sector to agree new partnerships and bespoke prepaid programmes, to grow the travel side of the business. Drew will manage all of Tuxedo’s travel programmes in Germany. He will be the main point of contact for STA Travel in Germany, managing the business partnership to ensure financial targets are met and delivering training on the prepaid card. Tuxedo secured the deal with STA Travel after working closely with the student travel specialist to develop its STA ISIC (International Student Identity Card) Cashcard. A UK first, the card is the only combined affinity and international ID / travel card on the market, designed for students and offering a prepaid cashcard plus an internationally recognised student ID. Drew speaks German fluently as well as Spanish and Italian at business level and will also be assisting with translating marketing collateral and contract terms and conditions. The appointments add to a successful year so far. Tuxedo has recruited a number of new employees in locations around the world including the United States, Dubai, and Australia, to support the company’s rapid expansion and plans for further international growth. The recruitment drive is set to continue for the remainder of 2015. Rob Darby, Head of Relationship Management at Tuxedo, commented: “This is an exciting time for Tuxedo and we’re extremely pleased to welcome Joanne and Drew to the team. Their combined expertise and skills within the travel sector will assist us greatly in developing our existing client relationships and securing new partners. “Our focus has always been on building the foundations of the business and services we offer. Year on year we have witnessed considerable growth, with this year our best yet. We are now focusing on continuing this growth through the introduction of our products and services into other international markets. We are also making further investment in our people and the systems we currently have in place.” Joanne added: “I am excited to be joining Tuxedo at such a pivotal time as the business expands internationally. The launch and implementation of Escape has been innovative and I look forward to working closely with the partners to ensure they continue to be impressed with the programme and the customer care from Tuxedo.” Drew commented: “The rapid growth of Tuxedo attracted me to the working for the company and I’m very much looking forward to assisting the business in the next steps of its expansion plans.” Related articles Hahn Air Lines signs up to Travelport Rich Content and Branding Travelport, a leading Travel Commerce Platform, has announced that Hahn Air Lines is the latest carrier to sign up to its innovative airline merch...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T17:12:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
