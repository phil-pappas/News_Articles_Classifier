There’s a robot that checks you in, a dinosaur bot concierge and even a robot that carries your bags to your room. \nHideo Sawada is behind the new hospitality venture opening at a Japanese amusement park. \nHe said, “Of course these robots cannot just replace all human labour, but in terms of being friendly and polite, they are unbeatable. That’s why I asked developers to make robots for this hotel.” \nIn addition to the robots, the hotel has lots of high tech features. \nA facial recognition system lets you into your room, and this little tulip-shaped robot responds to commands to set alarms or adjust lights. And check out the radiation panels — they automatically detect body heat and adjust room temperature accordingly. \nLow staff costs and solar energy power help keep room rates to a moderate ¥7,000 (RM214), which is just US$56 (RM212) per night. \nSawada said, “I think low-cost hotels will become a trend just as low-cost airlines did. This is the first attempt toward that.” \nIf all goes well, the ‘Weird’ Hotel, may just turn out to be the future for budget lodging. — Reuters \nThis dinosaur robot is in charge of security and greeting guests at the Henn na Hotel in Japan. — Bloomberg pic More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T11:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T13:55:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
