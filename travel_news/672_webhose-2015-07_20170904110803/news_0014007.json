This Catalan architect is the main icon of modernism and one of the pioneers of the avant-garde of s. XX. His professional activity took place in Barcelona, which at the end of s. XIX was going through an economic boom due to the flourishing industry and trade. The new rich bourgeoisie that this boom generated was the great patron of modernism. In order to show their class and cultural ambition they wanted to live in modernist buildings, and that’s where Gaudí came into play. “ The economic boom of Barcelona in s. XX created a new rich bourgeoisie that funded the development of modernist architecture in the city ” Nowadays Barcelona is still full of modernist buildings that you can visit and enjoy their dreamlike atmosphere. No matter the neighborhood where your apartment for rent in Barcelona is, you will probably find one of these buildings walking distance from where you are. Let’s have a look at the most important modernist buildings by Gaudí you shouldn’t miss on your trip to Barcelona. Sagrada Familia It was quite obvious we were going to start with this building, an amazing and spectacular modernist cathedral that has been under construction for more than 130 years, as its construction started in 1882. This temple is full of religious and natural symbolism. So far, there have been constructed 8 towers, out of the 18 designed by Gaudí. Twelve of these are devoted to the Apostles, four to the evangelists, one to Mary and another one to Jesus. It’s possible to access to the top of some of the towers to see the city from the heights and see some details of the exterior of the temple from a short distance. The cathedral has three facades. The Nativity facade is dedicated to the birth of Christ, the Facade of the passion reflects the suffering of Jesus during the Crucifixion and the Glory facade, which is the main one, represents death, the Last Judgment, glory and hell. Park Güell Park Güell is a huge park with unique architectural elements designed by Gaudí.Although the main idea was to build a luxury residential complex, over the years this idea was abandoned. The park was opened in 1922 and has since become one of the main attractions of the city. In 1984 UNESCO declared it a World Heritage Site. With an area of ​​over 17 acres, Park Güell is covered by undulating forms, column-like trees, animal figures and geometric shapes. Most surfaces are decorated with mosaics made with colorful ceramic pieces. La Pedrera Known as La Pedrera due to its rustic stone appearance, Casa Milà is a striking modernist building designed by Gaudí between 1906 and 1912. This unique building, located in the central Paseo de Gràcia, reflects the artistic fullness of Gaudí at a time where he worked on various projects in the city. The rooftop chimneys are its most distinctive feature. Casa Batlló Built between 1904 and 1906, Casa Batlló is one of the masterpieces of Gaudí, a key piece of modernist architecture of Barcelonathat has become a myth of art. This building hides a whole fantasy world, in which, with the help of audio guides, visitors can discover and enjoy the amazing universe of Gaudí. Once inside the striking building, you can walk around the former residence of the Batlló family in order to know each of its curious corners, highlighting the attractive inner courtyard and the rooftop with its iconic chimneys. There are others buildings designed by Gaudí that you should visit, but if you are on a quick visit to Barcelona, at least make sure you get to know these ones. I’m sure you will never want to leave the fantasy world of modernism. ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T00:29:45.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
