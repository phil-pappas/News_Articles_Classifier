And press freedom, more broadly, must be better protected there.\" \nThe National Press Club's Press Freedom Committee speaks out on press freedom and transparency issues. The NPC, established in 1908 and based in Washington, D.C., is the world's leading professional organization for journalists.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T02:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T05:02:40.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
