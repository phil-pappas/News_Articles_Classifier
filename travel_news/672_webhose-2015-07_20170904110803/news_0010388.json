Hosted by the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AA), “Hong Kong Classics: Art, Culture and Music” was unveiled at HKIA today, launching six months of artistic programmes that reflect the variety and richness of the city’s multiculturalism.\n“Hong Kong Classics: Art, Culture and Music” is the first integrated, culture-themed festival held at HKIA. In celebration of the airport’s 17th anniversary, the AA has teamed up with various local artists and organisations for a spectacular series of events at HKIA. This festival aims to enhance the airport’s artistic ambience and passenger experience, showcasing the unique East-meets-West culture, art and music in Hong Kong – where the old and the new live side by side.\nProfessor Anthony Cheung Bing-leung, Secretary for Transport and Housing; Jack So Chak-kwong, Chairman of the AA; Fred Lam, Chief Executive Officer of the AA; and Anita Fung, Chairlady of the AA’s Arts and Culture Advisory Committee attended the opening ceremony. Two of the festival’s featured artists, artist Dr Dominic Lam Man-kit and composer Michael Lai also appeared in the ceremony to show their support. At the ceremony, Dr Lam demonstrated the impressive calligraphy style “Calligraphy from the Mind”. Meanwhile, Lai treated the audience to his Cantopop classics on the electric piano, flute and Shakuhachi, including Rouge, Ask Me and more, together with musician Sunny Yeung.\nFred Lam said, “We are enhancing the airport through both hardware and software improvements. In terms of hardware, construction of the HK$10 billion Midfield Concourse, self-financed by the AA, will be completed and commence operation by the end of this year. Moving forward, we will gradually proceed with the expansion of Terminal 1 and the planned construction of Three-runway System, in order to deal with the long-term demand of HKIA. On the software front, we strive to uplift airport service quality and passenger experience. Adding local art and cultural touches to the airport is an important step towards our goal. Demonstrating our commitment to this goal, the AA has established an Arts and Culture Advisory Committee to build a sustainable platform for organising artistic and cultural activities at HKIA.”\nAnita Fung said, “The airport is the first gateway for travellers arriving in Hong Kong. By showcasing local art and cultural vibrancy at HKIA, we hope the airport will become a place that promotes Hong Kong’s tourism and culture at the front line, and earns wider recognition and support from Hong Kong people. I welcome advice from the art and cultural sector and the community, which will help us gain more insights in programme positioning, theming and direction. We look forward to launching more activities that reflect local cultural tastes, as well as the expectation of Hong Kong citizens and international travellers.”\nThe festival line-up of “Hong Kong Classics: Art, Culture and Music” features six themed events, including four exhibitions and two musical activities:\n1. “Voyage of Discovery” –This photo-painting exhibition was created by Dr Dominic Lam Man-kit, who is the inventor of “Chromoskedasic Painting” and is widely recognised as one of the eight greatest contemporary artists in Hong Kong.\n2. “Two Studio” – This photo exhibition blends traditional Cantonese opera and modern photography, co-organised by the Chinese Artists Association of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Professional Photographers Network.\n3. “Ten Thousand Galloping Horses, United with One Heart” Installation Art and Education Project – Co-organised by the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups and the Hong Kong Jockey Club, this large-scale installation art exhibition displays horses decorated by over 10,000 local residents, based on the theme of the legendary Chinese painter Xu Bei-hong’s iconic image of a Galloping Horse.
