But investors have encouraged the Aim-listed online gambling company to return to the bidding table, according to a person close to the deal. More Fernandes loses Asia Tune Hotels partner \nThe company, which owns Sportingbet, is expected to emphasise chief executive Kenny Alexander’s experience in running a sport betting business to try to entice Bwin shareholders to back its renewed offer, the person said. \nGVC is likely to also point out to shareholders that rival 888 only offers online casino and online poker. \nThe battle to acquire Bwin.party comes against a backdrop of lacklustre performance in its sports betting operation. In 2014 Bwin.party’s core sports revenue rose 1 per cent to €237.1m while earnings fell 7 per cent to €50.1m, despite last year’s Fifa World Cup, which ought to have attracted retail punters, say analysts. \nThis week GVC, which is backed by Canadian online group Amaya Gaming , and Cerberus are planning to launch a revised cash and shares offer for Bwin.party of between 115p and 120p a share, surpassing GVC’s previous bid of 110p per share. Investment bank Houlihan Lokey is advising. \nThe deal from 888 was closed earlier this month at 104p per share. At the time the company said it turned down GVC’s proposal because it had “additional execution risks”. GVC had been working in a consortium with Amaya, whose potential role in the revised offer is expected to be decided this week \nIf it accepts an offer from another party, Bwin.party will have to pay a break-up fee of £5.7m to 888. \nGVC declined to comment on its planned bid, which was first reported by the Sunday Times. Bwin.party and Cerberus did not respond to a request for comment. \n£900m \nbid by 888 accepted by Bwin \nThe online gaming industry has seen a wave of consolidation over the past year as businesses try to address the disruption heralded by the growth of mobile gambling and sports betting. \nCerberus is one of a handful of private equity firms that own UK betting and gaming company Gala Coral, which last week confirmed its long-expected merger with rival Ladbrokes . \nLadbrokes chief executive Jim Mullen, who will lead Ladbrokes Coral, said he is launching an “aggressive three-year investment programme to build our UK retail, digital and Australian recreational customer base”. \nThe deal follows Amaya’s June 2014 acquisition of PokerStars and Full Tilt for $4.9bn in cash, creating the world’s biggest listed online gaming group.
