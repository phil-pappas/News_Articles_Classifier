Respondents are aged 18 to 65 and work at least 24 hours per week in a paid job, excluding self-employed people. \nThe polling industry's professional body, the Marketing Research and Intelligence Association, says online surveys cannot be assigned a margin of error as they are not a random sample and therefore are not necessarily representative of the whole population.
