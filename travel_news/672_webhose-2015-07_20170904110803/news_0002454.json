Stakeholders could include local citizens, municipalities, local aerodrome operators, air navigation service providers, and the Minister of Transport. \nThe Government of Canada is working in partnership with industry and community stakeholders to support safe and responsible aerodrome development. Canadians have 60 days to comment on the proposed changes. The final regulations are expected to be published in Canada Gazette, Part II, in 2016. \nQuick Facts \n• The proposed changes support responsible development of aerodromes in Canada and provide Canadians and municipalities with a platform to make their voices heard before an aerodrome is built. \n• Transport Canada is working with Canadians to support aerodrome development in a way that considers the safety and economic impact on communities. \n• Canada has 547 certified aerodromes and approximately 2,000 registered aerodromes. \n• The terms airport and aerodrome are often used interchangeably by the aviation industry. Canadian regulations and legislation most often use the term aerodrome. \nQuote \n\"I have spoken with Canadians and they want their concerns heard before aerodromes are built in their neighborhoods. These proposed changes will give Canadians the voice they deserve, promote Canada's aviation sector, and keep people and goods moving in communities across the country.\" \nThe Honourable Lisa Raitt", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T05:21:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
