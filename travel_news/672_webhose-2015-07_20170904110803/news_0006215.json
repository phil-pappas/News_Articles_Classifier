No stranger to big events, the 18,500 capacity stadium has recently played host to four FIFA U-20 World Cup games. Japan and Tonga played a Rugby World Cup pool game at the venue in 2011 which was the catalyst for a stadium upgrade.\nHome to the provincial side Northland Taniwha, this proud rugby region has produced some All Black greats including Ian Jones – ‘The Kamo Kid’, a 1.98m lock originating from the Kamo club in Whangarei. Jones played 105 matches for the All Blacks including 79 tests, and is now a popular sports television presenter.\nNorthland is also home to New Zealand’s rugby-famous “Going” family. Sid Going or “Super Sid” played 86 matches, including 29 tests for the All Blacks between 1967 and 1977.Whangarei is a 35-minute flight from Auckland or an easy two-hour drive. Whangarei is the largest city in the Northland region and is the gateway to the upper North Island.\nSteeped in history\nNorthland, is the birthplace of New Zealand and a region steeped in history and culture – being the site where Māori and Europeans came together to sign the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840.\nThe Bay of Islands, on Northland’s east coast, is one of New Zealand’s most popular coastal resorts. Northland’s sub-tropical climate and close proximity to the sea make it an attractive year-round destination which is reflected in everything from what you can do to what you eat. Citrus fruit grows in abundance and a wide variety of fresh seafood enriches the menu.\nTourism.jpgThere’s an array of activities from swimming with dolphins, to walking through ancient forest and discovering endless beaches. The historic lighthouse standing at the tip of Cape Reinga is one of New Zealand’s most iconic sights and a place of deep cultural significance to Māori.\nSource:-Tourism New Zealand\nRelated Posts British & Irish Lions 2017 Series host city: Whangarei Prince Harry enjoys New Zealand island escape Record number of US runners register to compete in Cuban Marathon ‘Marabana’ Are redundancies ‘a normal part of business’?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T10:14:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
