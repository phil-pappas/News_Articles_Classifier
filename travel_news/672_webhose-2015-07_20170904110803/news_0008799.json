Source: News Corp Australia\nEarlier, Liberal Senator Bernardi described the campaign for marriage equality as a masterpiece of “sloganeering”.\nHe said that the debate over gay rights was a contest over whose rights should prevail.\n“Marriage is not a right, it was not invented, marriage simply is,” he said.\nHe said he did not see why the institution of marriage should be redefined when gay couples enjoyed the same rights as members of a defacto partnership, and there was no legal discrimination.\nHe said marriage should remain a partnership that complemented the raising of a family.\nWhile acknowledging that same sex couples could sometimes make better parents than heterosexual parents, he said this did not change the rights of a child to be raised by a mother and father. He also warned about the consequences of destroying children’s links to their biological parents.\n“Where I come from it is children who have rights and adults who have responsibilities,” he said.\nLabor Senator Penny Wong and Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi shake hands ahead of the debate about same sex marriage at the National Press Club. Source: News Corp Australia\nBut Senator Wong, who spoke first during the debate, warned that denying gay couples the right to marry would only harm their children.\n“Same sex couples already have children, marriage equality will not change that,” Senator Wong said.\nSenator Wong, who has two children with her same-sex partner Sophie, said that denying gay couples the right to marry would only deprive their children and families of the benefits the stability of marriage could provide.\nShe said legalising same-sex marriage would not change most things in Australia but it would make a difference to gay and lesbian couples.\n“The sun will rise, heterosexual marriages won’t crumble, three-year-olds will still want more ice-cream than is good for them, but together we will have made a profound change,” she said.\nThe openly-gay politician asked everyone to remember this wasn’t a theoretical debate but one about real people and their intimate relationships.\nShe also noted that it was actually heterosexual couples who had revolutionised marriage.\n“It is precisely because heterosexuals have change marriage from an economic arrangement to a relationship of love and support that gay and lesbian people are seeking to join it,” he said.\nWhen asked about whether there should be a plebiscite on gay marriage, Senator Wong said she thought it would be a “delaying tactic”.\nBut if the majority of Australians and states did vote in favour of gay marriage as part of a plebiscite, Senator Bernardi indicated he would accept the result, saying “who am I to stand in the way?”.\nWhile both senators delivered measured arguments, Senator Wong’s quick comebacks had many on Twitter giving the debate to the Labor minister.\nPenny Wong throughout this entire debate #npc pic.twitter.com/R0xklGawkT\n— mat whitehead (@matwhi) July 29, 2015 EXCLUSIVE: Live shot of Penny Wong debating Cory Bernardi at #npc pic.twitter.com/BdHvXchoDV\n— Petra Starke (@petstarr) July 29, 2015 Senators Cory Bernardi and Penny Wong prepare to debate gay marriage.

Same-sex marriage supporters believe a plebiscite, which has the support of Social Services Minister Scott Morrison, could delay a law change.\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten announced at Labor’s national conference at the weekend he would legislate for same-sex marriage within 100 days of government.\nThe party also agreed to bind MPs to vote for the Marriage Act change — rather than have a conscience vote — if laws had not been enacted by the end of the next term.\nThe national ballot would mean setting aside current talks on a cross-party bill, which could come to parliament as early as next month.\nOpinion polls have shown 60-70 per cent of voters support allowing same-sex marriage — almost double that of a decade ago.\nOriginally published as Wong lands zinger during debate", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/matwhi/status/626231142484566016", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/npc?src=hash", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/29/1227461/681937-ca090422-35a3-11e5-a34b-af8954b82b5f.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/gay-marriage/penny-wong-and-cory-bernardi-to-debate-same-sex-marriage/story-fnizhakg-1227461568866", "http://t.co/R0xklGawkT", "http://t.co/BdHvXchoDV", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/29/1227461/678120-4ec63efc-359d-11e5-a34b-af8954b82b5f.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/29/1227461/802700-f6e9c7b8-35aa-11e5-a34b-af8954b82b5f.jpg", "https://twitter.com/petstarr/status/626225088912867328"], "published": "2015-07-29T22:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T07:49:26.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
