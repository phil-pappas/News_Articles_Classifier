According to organisers, “it is the most demanding and extreme running race on the planet.”\nBut that didn’t phase the young Aussie who crossed the line on the early hours of Thursday morning in the US, notching the second fastest time ever recorded by a woman.\n“You’ve gotta give it a crack,” she modestly told news.com.au from Lone Pine, California where she is recovering.\nAt the 70km mark, runners are allowed to be joined by a team member for support.

Picture: Badwater/Adventure Corps Source: Supplied\nThe starting line is in the aptly named Death Valley National Park in California — it doesn’t get much more foreboding than that.\nKicking off at 11pm on Tuesday night, Ms Wynd said the temperature was still warm. During the day, runners would face temperatures hanging in the mid 40s and despite the blanket of darkness, the heat would barely subside during the night — but it did get “a bit cooler” she admits.\nIt’s a non-stop race and runners must continuously push ahead. “I had pretty bad blisters,” Ms Wynd said. “I think I spent a total of 15 minutes sitting down tending to them.”\nThe rest of the time, she had to keep on keepin’ on. “You’re hurting ... and you try to do anything you can to distract yourself from the pain,” she said.\nFor her, that was thinking about people back home who inspire her. It’s a big deal to travel across the world and undertake this race and she has received a great deal of support from friends and family.\n“I didn’t want to let them down,” she said.\nThe average finishing time for the race is approximately 40 hours and racers face an overall time limit of 48 hours.\nWhen the girl from Lysterfield, Melbourne crossed the finish line in 27 hours, 23 minutes and 27 seconds, she was four kilos lighter. It’s a figure she said was more than desirable, but is almost impossible to avoid.\nBut on the upside, she was particularly pleased the battery on her iPod shuffle lasted the entirety of the race.\nDeath valley.

Secure in the knowledge she could complete the imposing course, her strong placing lit a fire underneath the young Australian and this time she went into the event with a personal mission.\nMonths out from the race, she told her husband she was going to go for the record. “I think he thought I was crazy,” she said. Only half-jokingly.\nEven though she had done it before, nothing is a given. “Everything’s gotta go right,” she said. “It’s a weird feeling, you always question yourself”\nFor Ms Wynd, it was about testing herself in what she called “the pinnacle of ultra marathons”.\n“I always like to find the next rush ... it’s about finding the next challenge,” she said.\nWhich is a good thing because there is no prize money for those who come first. However those runners who complete the intimidating course within the 48 hours receive a prized Badwater belt buckle. Proof of their torture.\nYou have to work hard for this buckle.
