Mr Forster, 62, from Ramsgate, Kent, who has a handicap of nine, took up the game at the age of 15 and started by playing once a week at Bromley Golf Club. He said: “I managed to score my first hole-in-one on the 159-yard, par-three third at Bromley during the summer of 1971, while playing in a monthly medal competition.” After brief spells at North Foreland and Prince’s, Mr Forster became a member of St Augustine’s in Ramsgate, where he succeeded in getting his handicap down to four. “When they appointed a new professional, I went out for a game with him to point out that the 259-yard, par-four second hole was, with a good shot and the right conditions, reachable from the tee,” he said. “I think I must have proved my point when I holed my drive.” The only Forster family member yet to achieve an ace is the dog His lucky streak continued when, only a couple of weeks later, he played another round with the same pro and aced the 148-yard, par-three 15th. After that, he didn’t look back. Over a period of 20 years, the hole-in-one specialist’s tally at St Augustine’s – a course with six par-threes – rose to 11, including three on the second hole alone. “I also had a hole-in-one in a league match at Canterbury on the second, another at Golf del Sur during a golf holiday in Tenerife and two more on the par-three Northcliffe course at North Foreland.” Mr Forster thought he had used up all his luck when he went more than 12 years without an ace, but left fellow club members astounded when he rediscovered the magic touch to achieve his 17th with a seven-iron on the 142-yard, par-three fifth at North Foreland. It seems his gift runs in the family: Mr Forster’s wife, Sheila, has had eight holes-in-one; his daughter, Sara – a PGA-qualified professional – has recorded three; and son Joe has had two. The only family member yet to achieve an ace is the dog. Genetic ability To further the claim that golfing genius is in the genes, a routine round for Kevin Lewis became a day to treasure when he holed in one on the same par-three on which his son had achieved the feat only eight months before. Nick Lewis, 16, who plays off nine, holed his tee shot on the 220-yard, par-three fifth at his home club, Bush Hill Park, near Enfield. Kevin, 48, followed in Nick’s footsteps when the two were playing together as they do often. That's my boy: Kevin Lewis aced the same hole as his son, Nick “On the fourth hole, I had a quadruple-bogey eight, which made me so angry that I was just going to step up and hit the ball on the fifth,” Nick said. “However, I managed to calm down a bit on the tee while waiting for my turn to play. “I took my shot seriously and managed to strike it perfectly – a slight right draw in line with the pin – and my playing partner said: ‘That’s in the hole.’ I celebrated like I’d just won the Masters.” Kevin, a 12-handicapper, added: “Traditionally, I always play a driver on this hole, but Nick insisted a three-wood was fine, as he’d hit a five-wood for his hole-in-one. I tried the three-wood and, fortunately, hit a shot which looked good, but the pin was behind bunkers so we had no idea how good the shot actually was. I get to play most weekends and Nick now plays at least three times a week, hence his handicap is far better than mine “It was only after searching for my ball at the front and back of the green that Nick looked in the hole and found my ball. The celebrations started there – I only managed to score one more point after that hole but didn’t really care.” Kevin has been fortunate to have had two previous holes-in-one since taking up golf: he recorded his first when he was 16 and his second five years ago – while Nick’s ace last year was his first. Kevin added: “I must confess I was totally in shock: firstly, to get the hole-in-one on the same hole that Nick had achieved it less than a year ago; and secondly, to have achieved it on such a prestigious day as captain’s day. “I have been playing golf for 35 years and Nick has been playing for five years. I get to play most weekends and Nick now plays at least three times a week, hence his handicap is far better than mine – although A-levels have impacted on this recently.” Practice makes perfect Practice is, of course, the key to a positive golf game, and Bristol youngster Louis Ross is testament to this after becoming one of the youngest players to win a Hugo Boss watch for scoring a hole-in-one. Ross, 11, who plays off 19, achieved the feat on the 150-yard, par-three ninth at his home club, Long Ashton. He said: “I hit my rescue club and the ball bounced a couple of times before rolling into the hole, which helped me get a net 67 in the junior championships. \"Golf is challenging and great fun to play. I would love to play professionally against Rory McIlroy when I grow up.” Triumph of youth: Louis Ross became one of the youngest players to win a Hugo Boss watch for scoring a hole-in-one If the talented youngster maintains his drive, discipline and genuine love for the sport, he has every hope of doing so. Naturally left-handed but a right-handed golfer, Ross has been playing golf since the age of five and is a member of the Gloucestershire County Academy squad. His father, Neil, said: “Louis’s very first competitive round was on the E-Z-GO Golf Tour two years ago on the par-three course at Thornbury. On the first hole he hit a seven-iron to 10ft from the pin and holed the putt for a two. He’s very competitive and hates to lose. The best part is that I’m 11 years old and have a Hugo Boss watch – how cool is that \"Last year, Louis won the Long Ashton junior order of merit and, as a prize, got to play golf with one of his golfing heroes, Chris Wood. “The best part of his game is probably his short game. He practises five times a week and plays on Saturdays and Sundays.” Louis, whose favourite golfers are McIlroy and Wood, also plays football for his school and is a huge Everton fan. “It felt amazing when the ball disappeared into the hole,” Louis said. “I think the secret to scoring a hole-in-one is to hit the ball straight. \"The best part about getting one is that I’m 11 years old and have a Hugo Boss watch – how cool is that.” BOSS Watches H1 Club BOSS Watches has once again pledged to reward club golfers with an exclusive watch for every hole-in-one recorded during a club competition in 2015, having given away more than £1m-worth of limited-edition timepieces since its launch in 2013. The scheme is open to any golfer whose club uses HowDidiDo – a free-to use, web-based social network for golfers – and anybody playing in official club competitions is eligible. Currently, more than 1,800 clubs use the website. In addition to the limited-edition watches, the “ace” golfers join more than 7,000 members in the BOSS Watches H1Club, which offers access to exclusive benefits and merchandise. No extra registration is required to participate in the BOSS Watches promotion as all official club competitions are recorded on the HowDidiDo system, so holes-in-one are noted and automatically ratified by the golfer’s club. www.H1Club.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T16:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T13:14:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
