She told the outlet she discussed her role as speaker.\nFormer colleague and treasurer Peter Costello yesterday joined the chorus of condemnation for Mrs Bishop, declaring talking about parliament did not justify claiming a travel expense.\n“The rule can’t be that you can just turn up somewhere and talk about parliament and then it’s justified,” Mr Costello told The Bolt Report.\n“I could wander up to someone at a birthday party and say, ‘look, I’d like to tell you about the parliament’ and they’d probably walk away from me as they normally do at birthday parties.”\nMrs Bishop attended two seniors forums on November 22.

Does Tony Abbott have the strength of character to do what everyone thinks should happen and ask Mrs Bishop to stand aside?”\nANALYSIS: BY SIMON BENSON\nBRONWYN Bishop should know she has no choice but to resign as Speaker. And Prime Minister Tony Abbott should know this, too.\nContinued and indefensible resistance to this reality will simply cause the Abbott government unnecessary political damage.\nTreasurer Joe Hockey’s admission that her extravagance at taxpayer expense doesn’t pass the sniff test is dead right.\nIt doesn’t because it appears to be a habitual offence rather than a solitary error of judgment, as she claimed.\nHockey, of all people, would be acutely aware of the gross hypocrisy he himself is now exposed to — that the end of the age of entitlement is not at an end for some.\nHe can no longer expect ordinary families to tighten their belts when MPs are loosening theirs.\nPoliticians have privileges that would exceed most people’s imagination. They get driven to work in taxpayer-funded limos, eat and drink for free at work and pocket unspent travel allowances.\nThese curiously labelled entitlements would exceed the ordinary worker’s salary. Bishop has demonstrated why they should be abolished.\nBut her handling of it and apparent indignation at having to be made accountable for it added another dimension to the political problem.\nHer petty retaliatory attack on Hockey showed even less regard for the impossible situation now confronting the PM. Abbott is now at risk of being exposed as lacking the capital to act against a key figure of the party’s Right when he knows it would be the right and astute thing to do.\nOriginally published as Bronwyn’s $800K bill for 2014", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/19/1227448/330632-b56e2844-2ddd-11e5-9e0e-b22a5c868d19.jpg", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/taxpayers-cop-800000-bill-for-bronwyn-bishops-2014-expenses/story-fni0cx12-1227448331060", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/19/1227448/330688-d0830bb8-2ddd-11e5-9e0e-b22a5c868d19.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/19/1227448/330770-c2d78dd6-2ddd-11e5-9e0e-b22a5c868d19.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-19T23:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T20:21:20.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
