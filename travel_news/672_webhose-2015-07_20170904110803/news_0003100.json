It was a feat for Seychelles as it was a well-presented event with over 100 attendees from the trade and media partners. \nThe annual event which has been happening for the last four years remained true to its aims of strengthening ties, opening new doors of opportunities while appreciating and rewarding all support extended by our partners. \nSeychelles, a paradise within reach is one of the most popular travel destinations both from the UAE and the GCC, nationals and expatriates being the fourth feeder market to the destination. \n“We garnered a tremendous increase with 42% from January to June visitor arrivals compared to the same period last year for the UAE region and 33% increase for the GCC region,” said Ahmed Fathallah, the Seychelles Tourism Board’s regional manager of Middle East. \nThe night was not only about keeping up with relationships but also to commemorate the Holy Month of Ramadan. \nThe Iftar event was wholly supported by Banyan Tree Seychelles, Constance Lemuria Resort, Enchanted Island Resort, Kempinski Seychelles and Raffles Praslin Seychelles. Our partner hoteliers were very generous to provide free stay at their hotels as prizes. \n“With the recent good development, the Seychelles Tourism Office Middle East is truly inspired to do more activities that can fortify our relationship with our trade and media allies. The good attendance we had for this event encourages us to come up with more activities like this one as we believe working closely with our partners to raise the tourism portfolio of the Seychelles is a must,” said Mr Fathallah. \n“Our annual Iftar event is the perfect platform to meet the trade and media people to show our immense appreciation and thank them for their continuous support.” \nThe night ended with a raffle draw with five fortunate people from the attendees taking home amazing prizes from the Seychelles Tourism office Middle East and the hoteliers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T10:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T18:28:32.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
