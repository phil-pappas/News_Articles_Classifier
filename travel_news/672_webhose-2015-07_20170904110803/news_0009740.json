Food supplies have been scarce in the week to date as transportation from the mainland has been disrupted. \nThe power, water and communication systems on the island, however, are ensured. \nHotels and other lodging facilities on Co To have cut, or even waived, room rates for the stranded tourists to share their hardship. \nProlonged downpours have led to flooding which has killed 17 people and left six others missing in Quang Ninh, around 180km east of Hanoi, according to local authorities. \nHeavy rains will keep battering Quang Ninh and other northern provinces until next Tuesday, possibly together with flash floods and landslides, the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting warned on Thursday. \nDownpours will continue raging in the northern region, especially in Quang Ninh, Hai Phong, Lang Son and Bac Giang Provinces, and mountainous areas from July 30 to August 4, the center said, adding that this rainy weather will also affect the north-central region.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T22:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T22:30:05.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
