The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said it had made its decision after examining the flight mission documents and crew schedules for 60 pilots and 15 co-pilots from January to May.\nIn a statement, the CAAC's north China division said it found there were 21 instances in which the crew did not take enough time off and another 65 instances of pilots working overtime.\nOkay Airways executives were not available for comment, but the CAAC statement said the carrier had vowed to rectify the issue and abide by safety rules.\nBeijing headquartered Okay Airways has a fleet of 30 aircraft - Boeing 737s and Chinese MA60s. Its main hub is Binhai Airport in Tianjin, and it flies mainly domestic routes. It added a few Asian destinations late last year.\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T20:03:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
