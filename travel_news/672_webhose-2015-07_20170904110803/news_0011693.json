They understand the importance of the tremendous growth and influence of the Asia Pacific region, and, through PATA’s various activities, they will now have access to PATA’s extensive network of members, as well as our in-depth research and insights to help them responsibly develop tourism in their country.”\n“Slovenia is enhancing its involvement in international organisations specialized in the field of tourism, and thus reinforcing and building its reputation and the position of Slovenian tourism in professional institutions and associations. The Asia-Pacific region is already an exceptionally important market for the Slovenian tourism industry, accounting for over 10 per cent of all foreign guest arrivals in 2014. I am sincerely pleased that Mr Mario Hardy, the Chief Executive Officer of the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA), will be our guest on the tourism panel during the Bled Strategic Forum, since we wish Slovenia to be the place where a closer relationship between Asia and Europe is built,” Karmen Novarlič, MSc, Head of the Tourism Division at SPIRIT Slovenia, added.\nSlovenia is a land of green diversity, situated in Central Europe; it offers endless year-round outdoor activities and healthy relaxation. It is the only country in Europe that combines the Alps, the Mediterranean, the Pannonian Plain and the Karst.\nThe changing landscape is a constant surprise for overseas visitors. According to the World Tourism Organization, the country saw a 4.8% year on year increase in IVAs in 2013, from 2.156 million to 2.259 million.\nRelated Posts Country-specific economic trends to effect business travel in 2014 PATA India chapter celebrates its 40th anniversary Norwegian announced three long-haul routes to America PATA Visitor Arrival Forecasts: Arrivals Well on Track with Forecasts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T04:34:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
