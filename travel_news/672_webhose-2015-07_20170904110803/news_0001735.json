FCA US Chairman and CEO Sergio Marchionne and FCA North America Vice President - Employee Relations Glenn Shagena were joined by UAW President Dennis Williams and UAW Vice President Norwood Jewell , along with more than 30 members of the bargaining team, to mark the occasion. \" FCA US and the UAW have a long standing partnership that has a proven track record of being able to overcome challenges when faced with adversity,\" said Marchionne. \"There is a great deal of mutual respect between us, and I am confident that we have the right leadership and the right teams in place to negotiate a long-term, responsible agreement.\"As the two sides met in 2011, FCA US , formerly Chrysler Group, was in the process of recovering from a painful restructuring. With the support of the UAW, the 2011 agreement allowed the Company to further rebuild and grow the business.

As a result, production at U.S. vehicle assembly plants has increased from 1.2 million units in 2011 to 1.7 million units in 2014. In June, the Company extended its U.S. sales streak of year-over-year sales gains to 63-consecutive months. \"Our UAW members are an integral part of the success of FCA US , and they need to participate in the economic well-being of the company,\" said Marchionne. \"It is important that we effectively come up with a compensation plan that allows union members to participate in the profit generation based on performance, while allowing us to maintain a competitive cost structure in a downturn.\"Marchionne cited the implementation of World Class Manufacturing (WCM) as having made the Company's plants more competitive, flexible and efficient. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T22:19:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
