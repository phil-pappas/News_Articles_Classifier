The firm also notes that it appears Criteo has recently added Alibaba ( BABA ) and Target ( TGT ) as customers. \nWHAT'S NEW: In a note to investors this morning, Pacific Crest analyst Evan Wilson said that the firm's checks indicate that Criteo now has cookies on 49% of the top 100 retail and travel websites in the U.S. Wilson noted that Google ( GOOG ) has 76% of the top 100, but suggested also that its heavy overlap with Criteo reinforces the view that the two companies' cookies serve different purposes. Wilson said Target was a notable Criteo win in the U.S. during Q2, while also saying the firm discovered that some Alibaba sites outside of China now have a Criteo cookie for the first time. Wilson raised his 2016 estimates for Criteo citing the continued strong checks and increased the firm's price target on the stock to $65 from $55. \nPRICE ACTION: In early trading, Criteo grained $2.30, or 4.8%, to $49.97. \nReporting by Jason Keil.
