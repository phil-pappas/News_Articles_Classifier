Thompson, president and CEO of the Brand USA, a private marketing organization created five years ago to promote the United States as a destination. That's on the way to the Obama administration's goal of attracting 100 million visitors by 2021, from 55 million in 2012.\n\nIn this picture taken Tuesday, July 21, 2015, US Department of Commerce Kelly Craighead smiles as she arrives for a press conference in Milan, Italy.

You can learn a lot of history through food,\" Catania said.\nThompson said Brand USA's goal is to attract visitors not only to cities well-known for their cuisine, but also to smaller towns and rural areas that also have food stories to tell.\n\"Palates have no boundaries,\" said Dorothy Cann Hamilton, founder and CEO of the International Culinary Center and president of the Friends of the USA pavilion. She declared the days that the hamburger defined American food as bygone, saying American cuisine is developing regionally, with strong immigrant influence.\n\"We don't think the rest of the world understands how regional tastes are,\" she said. \"If you are Vietnamese and living in New Orleans you are eating a lot of shrimp. You won't necessarily see that in New York.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T16:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T01:48:57.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
