An environmental assessment (EA) evaluated the commercial allocations for the Visitor Center and West Glacier Units and a decision by Forest Supervisor Earl Stewart on July 6 determined the allocations should be increased. This decision increases the commercial allocation on trails and Mendenhall Lake to meet the public demand for more opportunities for guided recreation experiences while protecting the MGRA’s natural resources. \nThe number of visitors to Juneau has increased substantially over the last 19 years and visitors have increasingly looked for guided services or commercial transport to help them experience the MGRA. This decision increases the commercial allocation on trails and Mendenhall Lake to meet this demand and to increase public safety. Inexperienced visitors are often lost or injured while trying to get near the glacier or while paddling on the lake surface. \nCommercial Outfitters and Guides interested in offering services in the MGRA over the next several years should apply for the opportunity this summer. A prospectus will soon allow for bids from commercial guides and transporters. \nThe Decision Notice and Finding of No Significant Impact for the Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area Management Plan Revision, Commercial Guide, Outfitter and Transport Services project are available online at http://www.fs.fed.us/nepa/nepa_project_exp.php?project=37050 under Project Documents.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T21:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T01:00:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
