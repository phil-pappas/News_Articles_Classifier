Our Year of Food and Drink has also inspired many to discover the culinary delights on Scotland’s doorstep.”\n“The international outlook is complicated with a direct impact from the poor exchange rate of the Euro. However, the North American market remains strong after a buoyant 2014 and we continued to see a large rise in the number of these very important visitors who contribute a lucrative amount to Scottish tourism.\n“Overall, the statistics are good, and Scotland bucked the UK trend, but this positive first quarter is by no means a fait accompli for the year. We, as an industry, must work hard to ensure we stay ahead of the game. The success of 2014 raised Scotland’s profile to extraordinary heights, but to keep it there, we have to invest and commit to guarantee that our stunning country remains on top of the world. This will take innovative thinking, planning and collaboration, but with such a beautiful country and such interesting, friendly people, I have no doubt we can make it happen.”\nSource:-Visit Scotland\nRelated Posts Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building Destination NSW Regional Manager UK And Germany Appointed New VisitScotland data reveals regional visitor trends for 2012 Visitor attractions to be discovered in Valais Village at Europa-Park on occasion of 20th anniversary Chelsea Football Club Hosts Leaders Sport Summit 2013, the world’s most Prestigious Sport Business Summit", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T20:06:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
