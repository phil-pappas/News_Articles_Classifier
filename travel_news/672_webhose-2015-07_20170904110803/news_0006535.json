My favourite combination is basil, mint, dill and tarragon. SERVES 2 INGREDIENTS • 4 free-range, organic eggs • 2 small bunches soft herbs, a mix of any of the following: mint, parsley, dill, chives, tarragon, chervil, basil • a little butter or coconut oil For the filling • 1 small handful goat’s cheese, feta or ricotta • good grating of lemon zest • 1 handful spinach or greens, shredded METHOD Crack the eggs into a bowl, add a healthy pinch of salt and some freshly ground black pepper, and whisk. Finely chop the herbs and add to the eggs. Put a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat then add the butter or oil. Allow to bubble, then lift and tilt the pan so the butter or oil covers the surface. Put the pan back on the hob and pour in the eggs. Allow to sit untouched for 20 seconds or so, until they begin to set, then use a fork to pull the omelette away from the edge of the pan into the middle, angling the pan so egg runs back into the bit you have just exposed. Do this another five or six times in different places so you have waves of egg. Now leave your omelette to cook until it is almost set, which should take a minute or two. Scatter the fillings on one half of the omlette, then flip the other side over to form a half-moon shape and cook for a further 30 seconds.Your omelette should be just-set in the middle, still soft and curdy, turning golden in patches on the outside. Once perfect, slide it on to a warm plate and serve immediately with a shock of dressed salad. “A Modern Way to Cook” (HarperCollins, £25), by Anna Jones, is available from Telegraph Books for £20 with free p&p Light summer dishes from A Modern Way to Cook Avocado, tahini and olive smash flatbreads Spinach and lemon polpette Omelette with goat's cheese and soft green herbs The best omelette recipes Indian masala omelette Tom Kerridge's omelette Arnold Bennett Wild mushroom and mascarpone omelette telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T07:19:21.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
