Currently, around 500,000 students from lower income households rely on maintenance grants. For those whose household income is less than £25k, such grants reach up to £3,387 per year and do not have to be repaid. However, during last week's budget announcement, the Chancellor George Osborne announced that maintenance grants would be replaced with a loans-based system from 2016/17, which students will have to repay once they are earning £21,000 a year. Mr Osborne said there was a “basic unfairness in asking taxpayers to fund grants for people who are likely to earn a lot more than them.” However, critics of the plans have warned that the end of state support could lead to the most vulnerable being excluded from higher education. Megan Dunn, NUS National President, said: “Living in rat-infested houses or even having to sleep in corridors cannot continue to be just a ‘fact of student life’ on campuses across the country. Megan Dunn, president of the NUS \"Students living on beans because they cannot afford healthy foods remains a punchline to a joke. It isn’t a joke. It is a national scandal.” A recent poll conducted by YouGov found that replacing grants with loans was the least popular measure in the budget, revealing that the public do not back the reforms. \"We must take local and national action to secure a u-turn on maintenance grants. We must also tackle the causes of this crisis and cut the costs that are pricing the poorest out of education,\" Ms Dunn added. \"That's why we will need to harness opposition party support and demonstrate widespread opposition the Government’s plans.\" The campaign hopes to call for a national debate on the axing of grants. A direct fight to Parliament is planned for October, when the NUS will organise a national lobby.
