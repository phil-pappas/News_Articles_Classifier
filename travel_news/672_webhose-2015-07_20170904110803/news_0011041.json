Also now known as Te Ika-a-Maui – “the fish of Maui,” the Maori name that recently received an official stamp of approval in the spirit of Haida Gwaii – the North Island offers a rich diversity of landscapes, from soft ocean beaches to rocky mountain peaks. Most importantly, boredom isn’t an option. \nSandboarding – zooming down dunes on a foam boogie board – is one way to guarantee that. Ahipara , on the west coast of Northland, the country’s northernmost region, is a fantastic place to start. The two-restaurant, no-ATM town sits at the foot of the famous Ninety Mile Beach, a wide, flat, packed-sand expanse that’s also technically a road (and about 90 km long). It’s a prime spot for other active adventures such as surfing, land yachting, quad biking, horse trekking and kayaking. It’s also just 15 minutes from Kaitaia , launch point for numerous bus tours to Cape Reinga , New Zealand’s northernmost accessible point. \nThe focus on fresh air and adventure continues heading south from Ahipara. At the almost 30-year-old Goat Island Marine Reserve , a popular diving and snorkelling spot about an hour north of Auckland , a wetsuit, mask and flippers are all that’s needed to glide across an underwater wonderland, spotting seaweed forests, plenty of huge fish and manta rays. \nMount Maunganui , a treasured beach getaway for generations of Kiwis, offers a hike up to the summit of Mauao , the 232-metre extinct volcano that’s the town’s focal point. Verdant pathways are filled with native birdsong and panoramic views of the Pacific and of Tauranga Harbour. The town made headlines a few years ago when container ship MV Rena crashed on a nearby reef and spilled oil and debris on the shore; now, the bulk of the wreck has been removed and the kilometres-long stretch of white-sand beach is clean again. It’s still a playground for surfers, kayakers, kiteboarders and paddleboarders; not to mention the kids competing in the national surf life-saving championships. \nRotorua is one of the country’s top tourist destinations, due to its status as a Maori cultural centre and hyperbole-inducing natural environment. It’s an active geothermal area complete with geysers, steaming sulphuric vents, bubbling mud pools and a plethora of natural hot springs that made it a spa destination even back in the 19th century. \nBut it’s Rotorua’s year-round mountain biking scene that’s been grabbing headlines and luring visitors of late. Wade Garmson, guide with Multi-Day Adventures , leads visitors on a tour of the Redwoods Whakarewarewa Forest , which contains 130 kilometres of dedicated bike trails. New Zealand’s mountain biking trails are graded from one to six – that is, easy to insane. Back in town, pedal pushers recover first with pizza and local craft beer at Brew, then with a twilight soak in the mineral-rich lakeside hot pools at the Polynesian Spa. \nAfter two days of riding, Volcanic Hills Winery at Skyline is a welcome spot for a celebratory tasting. As winemaker Sean Beer runs through a crash course on Kiwi wine-growing regions, some in attendance are only half listening. \nThey have more adventures in mind. \nIF YOU GO \nAir New Zealand flies direct from Vancouver to Auckland five days a week (daily from mid-December to mid-January), with frequent connections to Tauranga, Rotorua and other cities. \nAhipara Adventure Centre rents a full range of gear: boogie boards, surfboards, wetsuits, quad bikes, land yachts, kayaks and more. Or traverse Ninety Mile Beach on horseback with Ahipara Horse Treks ; tours start at $65 per person. Access to Goat Island Marine Reserve is free; rent wetsuits and snorkelling gear at nearby Octopus Hideaway . Rotorua-based Multi-Day Adventures arranges small-scale adventure tours across New Zealand, covering activities including mountain biking, whitewater rafting, kayaking, hiking and rock climbing. For those on a tight schedule, their popular Rotorua Adventure Day ($360 per person) begins with two to three hours of mountain biking followed by a rafting adventure that includes a seven-metre waterfall drop, then finishes with a lake kayak to hot pools accessible only by boat. \nRent bikes on-site at the Redwoods Whakarewarewa Forest or Skyline Rotorua with Mountain Bike Rotorua , who also offer guided tours and bike mechanical support. © Copyright (c) Postmedia Network Inc.
