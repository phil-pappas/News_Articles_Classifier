And in such scenic surroundings – the mountains serve as an amazing back drop while the view across to the Mediterranean is nothing short of spectacular.”\nThe Australian envoy went on to say, “Lebanon has much to offer, particularly when it comes to tourism – both domestic and international. And the tourism sector is important for Lebanon – as it is for Australia. Tourism contributes to national income, creates jobs and accounts for a significant portion of the labour market. In 2014, the tourism sector was estimated to contribute to over 3 billion dollars to the economy, or almost 7% of the GDP. This is despite the regional turmoil which has decreased tourists’ number to the region and to Lebanon.\nThe Ambassador concluded, “So, today the tourism industry relies on the large number of Lebanese living abroad, who return regularly to the country during the summer season. And that’s why I feel privileged to be able to raise the Australian flag here at Hayda Lebanon – because despite the physical distance between our two countries, our ties are strong.”\nIt is to note that the Austrian flag was raised at the model village last week in the presence of the Austrian Ambassador and the Austrian community in Lebanon.\nA Lebanese-Cypriot day will also be taking place at the Hayda Lebanon exemplary village next Saturday, July 11, 2015, in the presence of the Maronite Bishop in Cyprus, Joseph Sweif and Cypriot Ambassador to Lebanon.\nRelated Posts Chelsea Football Club Hosts Leaders Sport Summit 2013, the world’s most Prestigious Sport Business Summit BOC Aviation Marks 20th Year With Record Net Profit in 2013 UK-based tour operator offers weekend trip to other side of planet The Lion King opens in Sydney Giles Government to renovate Milingimbi Art and Culture Aboriginal Corporation", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T21:20:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
