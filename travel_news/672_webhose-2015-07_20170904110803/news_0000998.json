Passport of child is about to expire, which needs to be renewed. I read at few posts that both parents should be present while applying for passport renewal of minor, if not possible then a letter from embassy will be required from father side. Both parents have their spouse's names in their passports. Will it still need letter from embassy. I am not getting visibility on this. Please let me know this process and what would be best way ?
