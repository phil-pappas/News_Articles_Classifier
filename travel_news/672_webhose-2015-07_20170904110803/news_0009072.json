One half hour costs about 140 euro ($190)!” \nThe man with a snail-spiral sink in his bathroom, snail-shell handles on his cupboards, and snail shell fridge magnets senses a potential source of profit. He’s working with the University of Vienna on medical applications of the enzymes from snail slime, and particularly their use in healing wounds. \n“But I’m more interested in the beauty market,” he says. “Katie Holmes is using this.” \nFor now the former IT consultant, who seems far too dapper to be a farmer, welcomes visitors who are more interested in their palates than their pimples. Around him are fields of rapeseed, prettily dotted with poppies and daisies, and the still afternoon air is heavy with birdsong. It’s delightful. Can we really still be in the city? \n“To the horizon it’s Vienna,” he says. “We are famous for having agriculture in the city. We have wine, we have vegetables, and we have corn.” \nBut Gugumuck farms livestock, although his herd is invisible until he turns over wood planks leaning on long central supports. Over 50,000 large edible snails, part of an annual crop of 200,000 escargots, huddle together in the shade. \nSnails were first farmed in this area in Roman times. Slowly they’ve been slipping back onto the menus of Austria’s most fashionable restaurants, and Gugumuck is expanding to keep up with demand. \nModern gourmets connect snails with France, but originally it was Austrian cookbooks that had more snail recipes. In Vienna demand outstripped supply and boats brought escargots down the Danube from Germany to a snail market in city centre. \n“Snail snacks were so popular that you could find them on every corner and they cooked them with wine and vinegar,” Gugumuck says. “Now it’s slow food. But then it was a little bit fast food.” \nEscargots were very popular during the meat-less fast imposed by Catholicism during Lent. Indulgent priests allowed snails as a supposed non-meat substitute for beef or chicken. \nSuch substitution has also been the starting point for the modern revival. Gugumuck welcomes visitors to take a tour of his farm because it increases their willingness to try something new, and he produces ragouts in which snails replace meats. \nBut it doesn’t take much imagination to create original snail dishes in varieties well beyond the classic garlic-butter version. Gugamuck thinks chefs should cut back on the garlic and let the slightly nutty flavour of the snail meat come through. It’s mild enough to adapt to myriad recipes, and the Viennese even make a snail dessert. \nAnd for gourmets, Gugumuck produces snail liver and snail caviar. The liver is tiny and looks like a mini snail itself. Despite its pasty texture it has a liverish taste, but is made in such small quantities that it is not typically spread on toast. \n“Big snail farmers, they use just the meat and the rest is thrown away,” Gugumuck says. “But our philosophy is to use the whole a animal.” \n“Tomorrow I’ll send some livers to Germany,” he adds. “A restaurant in Stuttgart ordered them for Monday.” The snails also go by air to New York. \nEthical eaters will be pleased that the race to the moral high ground is one of the few snails can win. Gugumuck’s one small field might not be big enough to feed a single cow, but it produces 1,000 kilos of snail meat a year in a more sustainable manner. \nSnails also have primitive nervous systems compared to cows and are harvested with kindness while they hibernate against the summer heat. \nGugumuck feeds them on plants such as dandelions, mangolds and mustards. He claims his organically fed snail meat has more protein of beef, is high in omega-3 fatty acids, and is less able to transmit ills to humans. There are no known cases of mad snail disease. \nBack in the city, a day spent in Vienna’s elegant centre admiring the museums, galleries and palaces of what was once the capital of a vast European empire, is well rewarded by an evening with snail selections from the menu of Michelin-starred chef Konstantin Filippou. These include inventions such as escargots with salted breaded chicken hearts, green beans, lovage sauce, and a mousse of snail tartare, topped with chicken chips. \nOr there’s more casual dining aboard Badeschiff, a former container vessel moored permanently on the Danube. Here Sandro Balogh of trendy shipboard Holy Moly! restaurant, offers snail variations on Austrian specialties. These include snails skewered on a piece of thyme to accompany beef tartare, and an adaptation of zwiebelrostbraten, made from roasted potatoes and onions but with smoky snails instead of the beef. \nVienna is the only capital city in the world with a significant wine industry within its boundaries. The local dry wines made from the Grune Veltliner grape are just right to accompany escargots. In fact they slide down together perfectly. \nWhether you decide to put snails on your face or not, it’s worth going to Vienna to put some in your mouth. \n\nNEED TO KNOW \n— Herr Gugumuck’s farm is in the Vienna suburb of Rothneusiedl. Tours (available in English) are run from May through October for 15 euro (about $16) per person. E-mail office@wienerschnecke.at.
