Three months into the role, she talks to Patrick Whyte about her vision for the tour operator \n﻿The new retail boss of Thomas Cook has suggested the company could expand its retail network as it seeks to bolster its presence in key areas.Kathryn Darbandi, who spent 28 years at rival Tui UK, raised eyebrows across the industry when she switched allegiances to Cook, and has now set her sights on transforming her former rival’s business.Tui announced Darbandi’s departure in September, but she insists she did not know about the Cook role at the time.“It doesn’t look like that from the outside looking in,” she admitted to TTG. “But trust me, that is the case.”Although she has only been in the job for 12 weeks, Darbandi has wasted no time in getting to know the business, having criss-crossed the country visiting stores and spending time abroad in resort.For now however, she will concentrate on continuing the work started by her predecessors, which after years of store closures could actually include adding to the store network.“There are some locations where we’re not featured where we should be. We’re also looking at relocating in some places,” she revealed.“We are absolutely investing a significant amount of money in the look and feel of the retail estate. We’ve got a good acquisition strategy so we’re looking at locations where we’re not actually featured.” Darbandi’s role \nThomas cook’s new retail boss will look after… 830 retail stores (572 Thomas Cook and 258 Co-operative Travel) 10 of these are the firm’s concept stores 450 managers and cluster managers Two call centres in Peterborough and Falkirk, each with 300 staff \nNot on the agenda though - at least at the moment - is the full-scale brand merger that Darbandi implemented at Tui, where she helped consolidate 1,200 retail outlets following the coming together of the Thomson owner and First Choice.Thomas Cook has 830 shops, 258 of which are branded Co-operative Travel after the creation of the retail joint venture in 2011. “It’s a separate strategy and it’s entirely different. We don’t have any plans to do that. I need to spend more time understanding the different brands but from what I’ve seen so far they both work brilliantly, separately,” Darbandi said.“We get two bites at the cherry, sometimes in the same town in the same high street, and we’re actually doing very well with both brands on the high street so there are no plans at this stage to follow that strategy.”The last set of available accounts for the agency division (TCCT Retail Ltd) reveal that the company is back in the black following years of losses. However, there still remains a question mark about the future of the tie-up. According to the terms of the deal, the Co-op has the option to sell and Cook has the option to buy the other side out “from the fifth year onwards”.Another initiative that Darbandi will not carry across from Tui is variable pricing across its channels. Tui last year brought in a £25 fee for clients who wished to complete an online booking in one of its shops.However, Cook remains wedded to the John Lewis approach of price parity across its website, call centres and in store.“What channels can choose to do then is discount at the point of sale, and that’s where you might find a difference,” she added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T19:22:27.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
