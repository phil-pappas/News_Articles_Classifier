Up until that point it was hard to tell if Markakis had any big emotions about his return.\nBraves right fielder Nick Markakis played for the Orioles in his first nine big-league seasons.

He’s always ready to compete. He’s a gamer, out there every day. Maybe he’s said a few more words.”\nThe Orioles drafted Markakis in the first round of the 2003 draft out of Young Harris College and he played right field for them from 2006 to 2014. He signed a four-year, $44 million contract with the Braves in December.\nMarkakis, 31, acknowledged it was a strange feeling to walk past the home clubhouse on his way to the visitors’ side.\n“To be honest, I spent nine years here and I’ve never even been in this clubhouse or this dugout,” Markakis said. “So that tells you a little bit about the feeling. It’s different. It’s a little weird. But life throws you a bunch of curves and it’s how you deal with it.”\nOver nine seasons with the Orioles Markakis hit .290 with a .358 on-base percentage and a .435 slugging percentage. The Braves signed Markakis as a replacement for Jason Heyward and Markakis entered Monday hitting .286 with a .368 on-base percentage and .359 slugging percentage.\nMarkakis said he still feels a connection to Baltimore. He noted that his children were born in Baltimore and said he and his wife made a lot of friends here over the years. Markakis said he’s still “got a lot of buddies” playing for the Orioles and he pulls for the team to do well.\n“It’s going to be a little different, a little weird being over here,” Markakis said. “But at the end of the day I’ve got a job to do and that’s to beat these guys.”", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/07/27/17/82/457128086.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-27T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T02:21:31.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
