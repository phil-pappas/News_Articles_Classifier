The tax is due to take effect from January. \nREAD MORE: International airfares will rise new departure tax \nAirlines, airports, the cruise industry and accommodation providers have united in their opposition to the charges, suggesting they could result in airlines axing flights to some destinations. \nThe Coalition Against Travel Tax, which has been set up to combat the tax, released documentation it obtained under the Official Information Act which showed the Government was warned tourism would take a $104 million annual hit if it pressed ahead with the border clearance tax. \nThe numbers came from a report the Government commissioned from consultants Sapere Research Group, which forecast visitor numbers would fall by 44,000 a year and their spending would drop 0.9 per cent. \nThe Coalition Against Travel Tax said analysis by international airlines and cruise companies suggested the actual impact could be higher. \nGuy said the tax would bring New Zealand into line with other countries by ensuring that international travellers rather than taxpayers met the cost of Customs and biosecurity checks. \nBut Tourism Industry Association chief executive Chris Roberts, who is spokesman for the coalition, said it was long-standing in New Zealand that border services were a \"public good\" and should therefore be funded through general taxation. \nHe appealed to the Government to at least delay the tax until 2017 while more analysis was done on its likely impact. If the tax was introduced, it should not be subject to GST, and a \"traveller reference group\" should be set up to monitor how the raised funds were spent, he said. Ad Feedback \nRoberts said the tax had been passed into law before any industry consultation and it was very ironic that Regulatory Reform Minister Steven Joyce said the Government intended to take a more collaborative approach to government regulation on Tuesday, the same day that submissions on the border control tax closed. \nResponding to a Productivity Commission report, Joyce said the Government wanted \"a more productive and collaborative approach between regulators and their stakeholders\". \nRoberts said he looked forward to those ideas being implemented. \n\"We are heartened by this announcement from Steven Joyce. \n\"While we haven't seen the collaborative approach he is talking about happen in this instance, he is also saying fee-payers should have more input into agency cost structures and that the Government expects agencies to take an 'open book' approach. \n\"We look forward to having the Government accept that there needs to be an industry group that sits down with Customs and the Primary Industries Ministry to discuss whether their costs are appropriate or not,\" he said. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T06:29:26.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
