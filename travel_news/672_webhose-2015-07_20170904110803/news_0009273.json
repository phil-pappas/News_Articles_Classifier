More than 1,400 jobs will also undergo voluntary retirement this year. \n\nMeanwhile, routes to Hyderabad, Changsha and Luang Prabang will be relegated to its THAI Smile unit, a LCC which operates smaller-body aircraft. \n\nHowever, THAI will be doubling frequencies to London and Frankfurt, each to twice daily, in an attempt to capitalise on its more popular routes. \n\nThe 55-year-old national carrier had suffered losses of 15.6 billion baht (US$4.5 billion) last year, but has since managed to make a comeback, posting profits of 4.5 billion baht in the first quarter of 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T16:32:10.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
