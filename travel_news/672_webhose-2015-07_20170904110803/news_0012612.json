Airline spokeswoman Emily Samuels says emergency responders met the Boston-bound plane Wednesday night and that the 143 passengers exited via air stairs and returned to the terminal. Chicago Fire Department spokesman Cmdr. Frank Velez tells the Chicago Tribune one of the plane's engines caught fire, but the airplane has since been secured. Samuels says that the company is awaiting reports on the incident and that she has no details about what happened. She says the plane will be inspected. The plane was headed to Logan International Airport in Boston. Passengers were flown to Boston in another aircraft early Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T19:14:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
