So you'll walk ten paces past the beach to get to Flying Horse Carousel, the oldest operating suspended horse carousel in the United States. Fort Mansfield on Napatree Point was a prime lookout during the Revolutionary War. Seafood fans know to bypass the more upmarket venues and get their fish fix at the down-home spots locals frequent. In Watch Hill, you can get a hot lobster roll with butter-toasted buns at Two Little Fish. Or have it packed to picnic at the Cooked Goose and enjoy it at East Beach. Black raspberry ice cream is a seasonal Rhode Island specialty available around town. The water's edge Ocean House is a Victorian-era hotel and the only five-star, five-diamond resort in the state.
