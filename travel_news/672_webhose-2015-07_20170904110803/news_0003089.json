We are very excited to announce our new partnership with TravelSmith joining their talented team of travel advisors. The TravelSmith Travel Advisors are a well-traveled group of experts including TV travel celebrity Samantha Brown, published authors Lynne and Tim Martin and award-winning travel show host Christine van Blockland. We’ll be writing about our travels and sharing our tips on the TravelSmith blog each and every month, but we’re also going to be testing some great TravelSmith travel gear and spotlighting our favorite item each month. Guess what? Our new travel gear feature starts now! Travel Gear round up Travel Gear Spotlight \nPacsafe Citysafe Travel Tote - Our first travel gear item is the Pacsafe Citysafe LS400 RFID Travel Tote. I chose this item because I have a tough time choosing travel bags. I carry a lot of stuff all the time. Between loading computers into my shoulder bag to lighten my carry-on, or walking around town with cameras in my purse, I never have enough room. I need a large bag, but I also need a bag that’s easy to organize. But most of all. I want to look good. I hate feeling frumpy in the airport. Deb’s loving her polished look in the airport – TravelSmith from head to toe \nPlus, I am constantly losing things and panicking every other minute that I’ve lost my iPhone or wallet. A big empty sac doesn’t work for me, but a tiny little handbag doesn’t do the trick either. The Pacsafe Travel Tote is Just Right! \nWell, after 6 years of full-time travel, I think I have finally found the bag to suit my needs. The Pacsafe Travel Tote is large enough to carry everything I need for my travels, but stylish enough to look good. I also find it to be very organized. That’s a first for me! \nWhat I like about it are all the compartments. I can slide my phone into an easy pouch in the front zipper area and zip my wallet in the main compartment. It’s even large enough to fit my 15 inch Macbook Pro or my iPad. Now I’m not rummaging through a bunch of loose items to find what I need. I actually have a spot for everything. \nPlus, I am a fan of the pacsafe product when it comes to personal travel safety . We first used Pacsafe when we travelled to India and needed to secure our luggage. We took a lot of overnight trains and our valuables were vulnerable when we slept. With our pacsafe bag protector, nobody could get into our backpacks, and we could lock them to a pole so that nobody could take them either. We were sold. Travel Tote is For Me \nMy new travel tote has the same great Pacsafe security features, but it’s not near as cumbersome or bulky. It has slash guard panels, a steel cable-adjustable strap and tamperproof zippers. Never have I felt so comfortable walking through crowds. I just lock up the zippers and stroll worry free. Exploring South Dakota \nSo, all in all I am a huge fan of my new bag. I knew I would be, that’s why I chose it! I have a feeling this is going to be a very long and happy relationship between me and my new travel tote. I’ll be slinging it over my shoulder wherever I go.
