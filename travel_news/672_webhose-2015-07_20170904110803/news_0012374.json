That first trip opened my eyes, and made me realise how easy it is to travel with a child. Since then, Junior has been on more flights than a regional CEO. \nHere are a few tips that have made our journeys just that little bit saner: \nBare necessities \nChildren really aren’t that hard to pack for. One thing’s for sure, they don’t care if their clothes don’t match. \nWhile it is tempting to throw everything including the kitchen sink into your suitcase, try this instead: Take only the bare minimum that you will need, and set aside a small budget (say SUS$50) to buy emergency supplies as and when you need it. \nOn a recent beach holiday, we bought extra diapers and wipes from the local supermarket on our way from the airport to the villa. Then we bought snacks and small, locally made toys as the holiday progressed, which saved us from hauling unnecessary items around. Plus, Junior got a few pretty souvenirs to boot. \nBe creative \nDon’t forget, you will need way fewer toys than you think. Anything child-safe can be turned into a nifty toy — plastic cups, straws, coasters, hotel combs ... the list is endless. \nOn a recent flight, we discovered that the complimentary packet of snacks made a great sensory discovery toy and Junior had a blast scrunching, shaking, gumming and throwing it. \nPacking light is easier if you take things that can do double duty, or even triple duty. I always pack a large muslin swaddle cloth, which can be used as a burp cloth, swaddle, nursing cover, blanket, change pad, sun shade (just throw it over the stroller), or even in a pinch, as an emergency sarong for mummy. \nTackling the flight \nToddlers can be a handful sometimes, but you can keep your hands free (and your sanity intact) by popping your child into a baby carrier when you’re trying to get through security and immigration. When you’re airborne, use the carrier to snuggle and walk her around if she gets fussy. \nAnother top tip is to book your flight to coincide with either nap time or bed time. \nYour child will be much more likely to sleep, which means a quieter, easier flight for you (and everyone else on the plane), and a well-rested child on arrival. \nGetting around \nTwo words: Baby carrier. Babywearing solved all nap logistics (just put baby in a carrier and head out) and allowed us to go to places where you couldn’t take a stroller, such as seaside walks and jungle treks. \nAncient ruins aren’t particularly stroller-friendly either — think Angkor Wat, for example. \nBut if babywearing isn’t your thing, or if your child is too old, an umbrella stroller is your friend. Umbrella strollers are ultra light and fold down easily for storage. They also aren’t too bulky, which makes navigating a strange city and crowded public transport much easier. \nConsider buying an affordable second-hand one that you can leave behind at the end of your trip — this lets you free up some room in your luggage for souvenirs. \nDining tips \nNothing is worse than having to plan multiple outfit changes, no thanks to your little messy eater. Travel light with a quality wearable bib. This makes cleaning up after a meal simple. \nTravelling can make meal times unpredictable and little ones get hungry quickly. Avoid unnecessary meltdowns by packing a selection of healthy snacks and water. Go-to favourites that pack well (and are easy to find) include dried or fresh fruit, crackers, mini-cheeses and homemade, low-sugar — TODAY More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T06:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T17:32:57.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
