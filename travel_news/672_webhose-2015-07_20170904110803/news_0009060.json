He cited figures showing CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 44 per cent between 2010 and 2014, and increase of market share from 2.6 per cent in 2010 to 9 per cent by May this year. “We have had the strongest organic growth – without joint ventures or acquisitions,” said Efromovich.\nHe said the increase in RPK (revenue per passenger kilometre) in 2014 was 24 per cent, against a national industry average of 6 per cent, while 17 per cent is predicted for this year, ahead of an average 4 per cent.\nAviation in Brazil is growing exponentially, from 33 million passengers flying in 2004, to 100 million last year. With a prediction of 200 million flights taken in 2024, “the future starts today,” said Efromovich.\nSchwab and Efromovich agreed joining Star would boost business travel for both the airline and the alliance. Schwab said: “From today Avianca will be participating in all Star Alliance fare products, it will become part of our round-the-world products and regional fares.”\nHe said this represented a significant opportunity for engaging the “many Brazilian multinationals we see operating all round the world” with Star’s Corporate Plus product – the airline single contract designed to replace agreements with individual member carriers.\nAvianca Brasil will become an all-Airbus fleet in August, when the last of its Fokker 100s leaves this year, bringing the average age of its 40-plus aircraft to under four years. It flies to 23 airports in Brazil, and operates 210 daily flights. Bogota in Columbia is currently its only international destination.\nSister airline Avianca Columbia has been a Star Alliance member since 2009. The two airlines operate separately – and are bound to do so by market regulations – but are both part of the Synergy Group, which is owned by Jose Efromovich’s brother, German.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TravelbizPaul"], "published": "2015-07-23T14:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T16:09:15.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
