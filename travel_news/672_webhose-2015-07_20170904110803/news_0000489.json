The British and Irish Airport Expo is being launched by organisers PPS Publications and Events and will take place from 8-9 June 2016. \nThe dynamic exhibition, which is set to be held in the NEC’s Pavilion, will include conferences and product demonstrations, utilising the NEC’s flexible indoor and outdoor space. In addition, visitors will have the chance to be taken on a guided tour of Birmingham Airport, which neighbours the NEC. In order to provide a tailored offer to its visitors, the exhibition floor will be split into three distinct areas; Terminal, Airside and Construction. Each zone will display the latest solutions, services, products and equipment for enhancing airport performance, customer experience, safety and efficiency. Paul Hogan, Managing Director at PPS Publications and Events, said: “Britain and Ireland are renowned for having among the most sophisticated and successful airport networks in the world, but until now there has never been a major industry Expo to celebrate this. The British and Irish Airport Expo has been designed to fill this gap by providing an invaluable platform for airport and industry suppliers to meet, showcase their products and share ideas and learning.” “Choosing a venue like the NEC, which has Birmingham Airport on its doorstep, was an easy choice for us - and for me - I am a born-and-bred Man of the Midlands and bring this event to the Heart of England with significant pride. The venue is located within a three hour drive of 75% of the UK population and has unrivalled connectivity by road, rail and air, so it’s easily accessible for our visitors. We look forward to working with the NEC and Birmingham Airport to deliver a fantastic exhibition.” Managing Director of the NEC, Kathryn James, who previously held the role of Managing Director at London Luton Airport, commented: “I am thrilled that the NEC has been chosen as the host of the British and Irish Airport Show. The UK homes some of the best airports in the world and employs a number of the leading industry professionals so to bring them all together under one roof is an exciting prospect.” Paul Kehoe, CEO Birmingham Airport, said: “The emergence of a major industry Expo for the British Isles and Ireland, which celebrates our world-respected airports network and provides a platform for the community to come together to plan and seek inspiration on its next moves, is long overdue and we here at Birmingham Airport are very proud and excited to host it.” Latest news", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T16:47:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
