The deal, worth almost £900m, followed weeks of negotiations in which two suitors - 888 and Aim-listed betting business GVC - were competing to take over the company, . Shares in FTSE 250 company 888 rose as much as 11pc after investors were taken by surprise with the outcome, while Bwin’s shares rose 3pc. 888 said the deal would generate significant revenue and cost savings for the business, saving the company at least $70m (£45m) a year by 2018. “The enlarged group will benefit from significant enhanced scale. We received unanimous board support from the directors of Bwin, ” said Brian Mattingley, chairman at 888 Holdings. Bwin, which has a market cap of £570.8m, revealed last November it had put itself up for sale, and a number of gambling companies are thought to have cast their eye over it. Frontrunner GVC had offered a higher price-per-share deal, but Bwin said yesterday that 888 had offered a better deal to shareholders in the long term, and was better suited to the business. The takeover will not result in Bwin being broken up, 888 management confirmed. “This is a transformational deal for 888 [which] looks to have secured Bwin.party at a reasonable price and efficient structure. Whilst there are execution risks, the deal is strategically compelling and we have confidence that the 888 management team can deliver,” said Nick Batram, an analyst at Peel Hunt. GVC had made a £906.5m cash-and-shares takeover proposal, offering 110p a share, which was backed by Canadian gambling giant Amaya. In comparison, 888 had offered 104.09p a share. 888 wooed Bwin by arguing there were strong synergies between the two businesses, including overlap offices in Gibraltar, Israel and Romania and the fact that Bwin’s Foxy Bingo business runs on 888 technology. Analysts said the merger should be lucrative for both parties, although it does not mean GVC’s competing 110p bid-a-share is off the table yet. “We think 888’s stock should be more attractive to bwin shareholders given GVC’s higher mix of unregulated markets and 888’s larger potential for synergies,” said Matt Smith at Morgan Stanley. Bwin was formed from a merger of Austria’s bwin and Partygaming in 2011. When shares in the merged business started trading on the London Stock Exchange, they changed hands for more than 190p, but since then trading has been weak Follow the Telegraph on LinkedIn.
