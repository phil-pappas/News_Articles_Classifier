Exhibitors averaged 29 appointments over the course of 2.5 days.\n“The excitement behind delivering our event in different key convention cities in the US adds variety and new experiences for all our attendees. Nashville is one of the hottest convention cities in America right now and whilst its very roots are in music (the Country Music Hall of Fame) there is also history, the arts, food – the city recently was nominated in the top 10 best BBQ cities in the US – and of course a variety of venues to benefit this industry. We will be there in one of its best months (June) and no doubt the town will be buzzing,” said Jaime McAuley, Event Director, ibtm america.\nTaking place from June 15-17, ibtm america will be held at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center, the flagship property of Gaylord Hotels. Just 10 minutes from Nashville International Airport and easily accessible to Music City, the Gaylord is known as the largest exhibition and meetings venue in continental US. Some of its facts and figures include 2,882 guest rooms onsite, 6 ballrooms, more than 100 technologically advanced conference and breakout rooms, some 600,000 sq ft of meeting, convention and exhibit function space and 4.5 acres of tropical gardens under glass with a river running through it.\nSource:-Ibtm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T23:24:47.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
