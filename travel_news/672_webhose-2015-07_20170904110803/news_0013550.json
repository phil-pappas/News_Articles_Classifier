Fortunately, she’s wearing a WI apron, as she’s already spilt tea over one of the white linen tablecloths. “It’s my first WI meeting and I’m super excited,” she says. “Mainly because everyone tells me that all you do is eat cake – and I love cake.” Our photographer was hoping Trott might, given the occasion, have swapped her habitual Lycra for a floral dress. No chance. She is here to inspire members to take up cycling and to present matching Lycra tops to the WI team competing in this year’s Prudential RideLondon-Surrey 100 (August 1-2). “I want to encourage them to achieve their goals,” she says. “Not just in cycling but in other parts of their lives.” •Tour de France 2015: Stage-by-stage guide Since she started cycling competitively aged eight, Trott, 23, has always set herself targets. “Mine are obvious,” she says. “I want to get to the Rio Olympics next year.” Trott’s dream requires unwavering commitment to her sport, but the reigning world and European cycling champion also keeps her life outside cycling pedalling forward, too. Team GB's Danni King, Laura Trott and Joanna Rowsell who won gold in the Women's Team Pursuit at the Olympic Velodrome at London 2012 (Heathcliff O'Malley) Since London 2012, when she was spotted canoodling with fellow cyclist Jason Kenny , the pair have become dog owners, home owners and are planning a wedding. “I like to jump from one thing to another,” Trott says. She eats lunch during our interview: a chicken salad sandwich from Marks & Spencer, rather than any of the WI sandwiches. Does she have to be careful about what she eats? “I can eat anything and everything,” she says. “When I stop cycling I don’t know what’s going to happen; I could end up being fat.” It was in an effort to lose weight that Laura’s mother, Glenda, took up cycling in 2000, and encouraged her husband, Adrian, and daughters Laura and Emma to join in. “Mum wasn’t sporty and then all of a sudden she turned into superwoman,” Trott says. “She’d be on the indoor trainer before work; she’d cycle 10 miles in the afternoon with her friends and then when my dad came home from work she’d go out with him, too.” In 18 months she lost eight and a half stone. At weekends, the Trotts would go on lengthy cycle rides or take their bikes to the local cycling track, home of Welwyn Wheelers , where Laura and Emma won their first races. “It was such a nice feeling to belong to something,” says Trott. “It makes you not feel like the odd one out.” •Women's Tour 2015, on the road and behind the scenes: in pictures At school, no one cycled and as a teenager Trott refused to wear her helmet as she cycled down the high street for fear of being teased. “Cycling is cool now, thanks to Victoria Pendleton and women’s cycling programmes such as Breeze, but back then nobody did it. I’d turn up to national races and there’d be 10 women; now you get 100 and entries are balloted.” It’s not just cycling that’s opened up to women but sport in general, she explains. “ London 2012 helped. There are more female role models, women achieving their ambitions. It makes you think, 'If they can, why can’t I?’ ” Laura Trott during the British Cycling National Road Championships in Lincolnshire in 2012 (Nigel French/PA Wire) Recently, Trott participated in a training camp in Lincoln, where the British National Road Championships were held last month. “It was just me and four other girls in my team, which was really good fun,” she says. “Psychologists say you don’t have to get on to be part of a team, but I think it makes you part of one.” Trott doesn’t relish being away from home, however. She misses her family and her sproodles – springer cross poodles – Spollo and Pringle. “They’re like my babies,” she says. “I’m obsessed with them.” Kenny introduced her to the dogs: Spollo was her 22nd birthday present. “He’s my special one; he was the first,” she says. “But we started having issues when I went away – he chewed through a wooden door – so last Christmas Jason gave me Pringle.” Trott and Kenny first met in 2010 but didn’t immediately hit it off. “I didn’t like him, I really didn’t. If he was in a room with me he’d just sit there; he wouldn’t come up to me,” Trott says. She changed her mind about him two years later when they got talking at the World Track Championships in Melbourne. The subject of marriage came up early on, leading Trott to believe that their relationship could be forever. But her dreams of a glamorous proposal were thwarted on Christmas Eve last year when Kenny asked for her hand in their sitting room as she watched EastEnders in her pyjamas. •Top 50 road cyclists in the world ranked and rated - in pictures “He started showing me £10 engagement rings on a website and told me that when he proposed that’s what I was getting,” she explains. “They were hideous.” Instead he presented her with a diamond ring he’d designed for her. “I know we’re young but I knew it was right,” she says. The wedding date is not yet fixed – they want to get Rio out the way first – but Trott hopes it will be immediately afterwards. She’s looking forward to being a wife but admits that she’s no domestic goddess. “I’m not a particularly good cook,” she confesses. “I’d have tuna pasta bake every day if I lived on my own.” It sounds like the perfect meal for a cyclist and one that could help her to cycle professionally until she is well into her 30s – US cyclist Kristin Armstrong won gold in the time trial at London 2012 aged 38. But all that will depend on children. She and Kenny are keen to have a family, and when they do, she will give up cycling. “I want to be the traditional stay-at-home mum, and if I was still cycling I wouldn’t be able to do that,” she says. This is not to say she wouldn’t take her children cycling; at the Prudential RideLondon last year, she was astonished by how many young people were taking part alongside their parents. “I can’t quite believe the organisers get away with closing all the roads in central London,” she says. “It’s the most amazing event. An eight-year-old me would have just loved riding past Big Ben and all the landmarks.” For now, Trott has her sights set on more Olympic medals, which means that when she’s on her bike, she keeps her eyes firmly fixed on the road ahead. When asked by her team director at a recent hill training event in Belgium what she thought of the view from the top of the climb, she couldn’t comment. “I was like, 'What view?’ ” she says. “Apparently, there was a beautiful medieval village up there but I was trying so hard to stay with the group that it completely passed me by.” telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T10:35:09.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
