But I had to give in to the spirit of the season on this one—a free app called, “All I Want from Santa.” \nThis Android app allows kids to use their parents’ phones to create and update wish lists and also send letters to Santa. The developer, Iconosys, designed the slick interface to appeal to children ages 4 to 11. \nThe wish lists can be edited, of course, as kids think of more (or other) things they’d like. And more letters can be generated for the North Pole. This can be done through the mobile app or accessed from a home computer. \nSeparate log-ins allow any number of children to use the program without having to download it again. English and Spanish versions of the software are available. \nThe information in kids’ wish lists and their letters to Santa are e-mailed to their parents. Not only does that keep the lists up to date—they’re getting everything they want, right?—but the letters can become cherished family memories. \nThere’s also a countdown on the app so you don’t miss the big day (if that was even possible). \nAnd the best thing about the app is—it’s free. Can I get a “ho, ho, ho”? \nThis is so much more high-tech than when I was a kid. I remember once telling my parents (for their convenience, of course) I’d just circle what I wanted in the big department store’s toy catalog. Now, smartphones and apps have made communication so much easier.
