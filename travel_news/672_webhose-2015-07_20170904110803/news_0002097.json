Armed with holy water, the cleric tamed the fiery mount and transformed the molten lava into a soupy concoction of body-benefiting minerals. \nToday, a sign at the base of the volcano prominently lists the mud's all-natural ingredients: calcium, magnesium and aluminum, among others. The implication is clear -- this isn't just regular dirt; this stuff is good for you. \nAs I sized up the crater before me, a man stained slate gray from his volcano attendant duties motioned for me to join him in the murky pool. \nI initially thought the mud would be thick and dense. Instead of being sucked into a vat of thick slop, however, I was surprised to find myself floating effortlessly, somehow buoyed by the thin, silk-like sediment. \nOnce inside the volcano, the attendants slathered the messy stuff on every inch of our bodies. Cautiously leaning back, a guide dipped my head into the mud as if baptizing me into some clay worshipping cult. That was followed with a quick \"massage\" -- a one-minute or so prodding that was generally relaxing despite its inelegant execution. \nAs more people entered the pool, the attendants repositioned our floating bodies with ease, arranging us like competing oil tankers waiting to pass through a canal. \nAt about 15 feet in diameter, however, the volcano soon reached capacity. As I moved to climb the slippery ladder leading out of the pit, a girl let out a massive scream and frantically paddled away from my direction. \n\"Frog!\" she yelled, waving her arms as if dodging a venomous cobra. The crowd followed her panicked lead, pushing toward the corner farthest from the amphibian. \nOutside the volcano, the guide had told us that we would rinse off in the nearby river and, if needed, a group of local women would be there to help. \nWalking with two female travelers I met on the morning bus ride, I made my way down the path to the river. At the end of the trail, a trio of women greeted us and guided the group into the water. \nAfter a few minutes of furious scrubbing, the woman paused and looked down at me. \n\"Take off your shorts,\" she said to me in practiced English. \n\"What?\" I asked. \n\"Shorts. Take them off.\" \nConscious of my newfound neighbors and the few feet of clear water that separated us, I politely refused, shaking my bottom half in the water to somehow convey that I was as clean as could be. \nConfident in my physical communication skills, I stood and thanked the woman. As I began to step away though, she grabbed the top of my swim trunks and pulled them out and down. \nI stood frozen as the woman smiled coyly and dished water onto my nether regions. Luckily, I was facing toward the riverbank and away from the two bathers I had met just an hour or so earlier. \nAfter seeing for herself that no mud remained, the woman released my shorts, and the elastic band snapped back into place. \nThankfully, I didn't lose anything in the volcano, as the guide had initially warned. \nBut the river was another story. There, on a sandy beach in northern Colombia, a little bit of my modesty disappeared into the currents of the crystal clear water. \nIf you go ... \nEl Totumo is a relatively quick 45-minute bus ride from Cartagena's Old City. \nThe entrance fee and transportation to/from should run around $20 per person. Beware of overpriced operators looking to charge you anything more than that amount. ‹previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T15:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T17:09:15.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
