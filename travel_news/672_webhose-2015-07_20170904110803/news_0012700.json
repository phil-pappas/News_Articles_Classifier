The Associated Press \nEVERETT — Snohomish County has agreed to pay $620,000 over the death of a severely allergic jail inmate who died after being served oatmeal that contained dairy. \nMichael Saffioti had turned himself in on a misdemeanor marijuana charge in July 2012 and informed staff about his allergy. His family sued, saying that the next morning he was served oatmeal that contained dairy, soon became ill and was ignored as he pleaded for help. \nIn a statement Monday, Sheriff Ty Trenary called the 22-year-old’s death a tragedy. He said the county was owning up to its mistakes and noted that since 2013 the jail has improved medical care. Among the changes are restrictions preventing inmates with serious health conditions from being booked for non-violent misdemeanors, screening all inmates at booking by a health care professional and hiring additional medical staff.
