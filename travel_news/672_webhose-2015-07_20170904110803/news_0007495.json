His audience consisted of 39 forward-thinking CEOs, including executives from LinkedIn, Fox International Channels, Aegis and Salesforce, all listening intently. “We are constantly experimenting and innovating to keep up with the demands of the industry,” Mr Kumar continues. “It is very important to have the desire to learn and experiment in new sectors.” Up until the Industrial Revolution, innovation – derived from the Latin innovatus meaning “to renew” – was frowned upon. In one extreme case an enthusiastic 17th-century puritan theologian, Henry Burton, was imprisoned for life and had his ears lopped off for deeming to have falsely accused bishops of innovating. Today it is the most important buzz word for tech businesses, whose leaders are keeping their ears attached to the ground in order to seek out new ideas, from start-ups, incubated projects or other left-field channels, listening for whispers which may disrupt their industry. It is very important to have the desire to learn and experiment in new sectors In a world of rapid technological advancements, where every human being is expected to be connected to the internet within the next decade, and the global population is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050, the urge to innovate – and not be left behind – has never been stronger. In 2015 one of the key innovations to hit the mass market has been wearables such as the Apple Watch, but how long before they in turn are replaced by implantables? What’s next? Tata Communications, the flagship telecoms arm of the $103.3bn (£66bn) Tata group – is a pioneering company striving to innovate and stay ahead. Mr Kumar believes that having the agility to evolve, as well as collective learning and collaboration, are the best ways to achieve these goals. Tata Communications carries almost a quarter of the world’s internet routes, and its round- the-world fibre network enables businesses to reach 99.7pc of the world’s GDP. Yet it is constantly looking to “add value” and is doing so by investing heavily in nascent projects and supporting start-ups, or “next generation” companies. For example, the company’s F1 Connectivity Innovation Prize aims to inspire creative minds worldwide to harness innovation in F1. “Working with start-ups, who are typically on the cusp of how to create value from technology, puts you at the heart of what’s cutting edge,” says Julie Woods-Moss, CMO of Tata Communications and CEO of its NextGen business. “But, with things moving so quickly, the difference between success and failure of tech start-ups is timing.” Cloud technology, and making it readily accessible from smartphones and other devices, as well as making it secure for businesses, is a core area of development and innovation for Tata Communications. “We need to make the internet fit for business, because it is the only thing that can support the proliferation of applications,” adds Mr Kumar, whose company released IZO last year, a global platform which connects businesses to the giant clouds of Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services. Mr Kumar says: “A sense of curiosity is essential. It stimulates the dialogue. Innovation happens at the intersections of diversity. We are developing strong relationships, and are linked to a portfolio of businesses across the world. “By stitching together the capabilities of different partners and disparate assets with our global reach, and creating a uniform presence in capability, we are adding value to everyone, the customer included.” How to innovate successfully \"The pace of change means that all leaders will have to confront issues. To see the fault lines of disruption, you need to spend time on the periphery. The reason this is so hard for large companies is because the usual playbook you follow – to solve the problem through analysis – does not work. Be curious, but edit your ideas and kill off any “zombie” projects, that is, setting up redundant teams for core initiatives.\" Scott D Anthony, managing partner, Innosight I looked at the current system of food and saw how it is screwed up – it degrades the environment, water, land, carbon and isn’t as healthy as it should be. I asked a simple question – what would you do if you could start over again? – and you can apply this approach to anything, be it education, or even your relationship. There is so much habit and inertia, so it is important to try to remove all the negative elements and create something better and cleaner. Josh Tetrick, CEO and founder, Hampton Creek Eric Ries’s The Lean Startup is the gospel in the tech start-up world. It suggests that companies should set very simple goals, but with short time periods, and build on top. You should fail fast and move on, and launch fast and get your product out in the market in order to be competitive. If it is a success you can take data from customers and develop the product, by dropping in new features, much like apps do with software updates.
