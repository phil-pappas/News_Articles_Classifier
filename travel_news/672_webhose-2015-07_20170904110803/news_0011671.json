It appears to be a very damages piece of luggage washed away from a Boeing 777 and belonging to a passenger on flight MH370, the missing Malaysia Airlines flight. \nThe suitcase was found on the same beach in the small Reunion town of St.Andrew. It was on the same beach debris of an airline wing was secured a day before on Wednesday. \nBoeing investigators on the island confirmed the part found on the beach on Wednesday was a flap from a Boeing 777 wing floating in the water for at least a year. \nAustralian, Malaysian and French authorities are now more convinced than ever, the material found on the beach may be a major step forward to clear up the mystery around MH370. This was echoed by Australia's deputy prime minister earlier, calling it a major lead. \nThe suitcase was locked and in very bad condition according to French authorities on Reunion. \nHardly anyone now believes earlier statements debris were from a different plane. All focus is on MH370. \nIs the greatest mystery in aviation history about to be solved?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T11:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T13:21:36.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
