In simple terms, a smart grid is an “internet of energy” that can monitor and respond to power demand in real time. This provides a more reliable and cost-effective way to get energy from the power stations to the homes and businesses that need it. Supply and demand is better matched, consumption becomes more efficient, and energy use is greener. Smart meters are the first step towards this. With smart meters alone, the nation is expected to save around £6bn over the next 20 years. It will cost an estimated £11bn to get the country up and running on smart meters, but total benefits are expected to reach £17bn. Right now, the energy grid is not responsive. But smart meters mean that in the future, the grid can work much more flexibly around demand. The smart grid has the potential to solve many energy problems. It will better match supply and demand, is more efficient, greener and wastes less energy Suppliers will be able to offer consumers better deals on gas and electricity at certain times of day, so that energy is used when it is plentiful. With the smart grid, suppliers can also make sure there is always enough power when we need it - like at half time in a big football match, when everyone turns the kettle on at the same time. The rich data of a smart grid means that energy providers will become better at balancing the dips and spikes in energy usage, benefiting the country even further. A greener future The smart grid has the potential to solve many of Britain’s energy problems. It will better match supply and demand, is more efficient, greener and wastes less energy. It is also more secure and reliable. The smart grid will be much better at integrating green technologies, from electric cars to home rooftop solar panels and heat pumps. It will also help the country to get the most from variable power sources, such as wind and solar. By plugging your home’s smart meter into the smart grid, households would be able to become more efficient with their energy usage. For example, you could set your dishwasher to come on when the electricity is cheapest, or you could be notified by text if you accidentally leave the heating on when you leave your home. • Learn about smart meters and find out how you can save money and time to spend on the things you love.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T15:03:37.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
