Or, at least, she left her job. “I didn’t take a decision to retire, but I did take a decision to leave the BBC,” she says. “I didn’t know what was going to happen next.” And, well, she’s not actually retired at all. Soon after she handed in her notice, the people from I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here got in touch , and she was whisked away to the Australian jungle for a gruelling stint on the reality show. “It is a very real reality show,” she says, “what you see is what you get. It changed my image. All of a sudden I got a whole new lease of life. All sorts of different television shows contacted me, it changed everything.” Jennie Bond in the I'm A Celebrity... jungle (Rex) She’s in semi-retirement, if you like. But with not working fulltime and having to go into the office every day, there’s plenty to be thankful for. “I really enjoy the fact that I don’t have to get up, and I love the fact that I don’t get out of bed, usually, until nine o’clock and have breakfast about 10.” But she’s not lounging around. Now 64, Bond is working a few days a week – “very rarely more than three” on all sorts of different projects, from lecturing on the Cunard cruises to presenting television programmes including Rip Off Britain and Cash in the Attic. Jennie Bond with her daughter Emma (Rex) “People who are fully retired always say that they don’t know how they found the time to work. Other bits and pieces expand to fill the time available,” she says. “I’d always dreaded the idea of not working, of working in a job as my father did which at the age of 65, the door [was suddenly] shut. That was it. I think it’s rather traumatic to have that door shut.” Not all jobs allow that to happen, she says: “as journalists, we’re very lucky to be able to not retire”. For many people, a second career is just the ticket , and, Bond says, “it’s quite important mentally and physically” to be able to do so. Jennie Bond with Angela Rippon and Gloria Hunniford, her co-hosts on Rip Off Britain (David Venni/BBC) Bond is working with Retirement Move , the new service which helps retired and retiring people move home with ease. A survey commissioned by Retirement Move recently found that half of over 60s admit that they struggle to maintain their property, and Bond is keen to emphasise that downsizing is very much an option. It is difficult, she says, “but it frees up a whole load of money and allows you to go and do all these brilliant things.” But what tips does Bond have for other men and women in her position – at the stage of semi-retirement , or full retirement, looking for the next stage in life? Jennie Bond's retirement tips Travel “I’m a greater believer in enjoying this world of ours. Travel is so easy and accessible now – comfortably off pensioners can now enjoy the world in a way that just wasn’t possible years ago.” Say yes to new challenges “Someone asked me to do the 10k BUPA run in London last year, and I thought, ‘Oh, go on then’. I do like a challenge. I still run , that’s one of my new things – I’m not fanatical about it, but I do run.” Embrace what you’ve got “I love the freedom I have now – I love the fact that I don’t have to be on a pager or on my phone all the time.” Keep being inspired by your ambitions “Don’t just sit and stagnate – take a look at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself who you were before you were a chief accountant, and a mum and a bottle-washer – who you were and what did you want to do. Why don’t you go and do it now?” Do something that frightens you “I love this idea of taking on challenges which are scary and frightening and doing them. With running, I don’t do it well, I do it quite badly, but I do do it! I get a kick out of that.” Follow @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T10:28:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
