Travelers can order and pre-pay for airport meals at Perry’s (Terminal 1), Napa Farms Market (Terminal 2), or Yankee Pier (Terminal 3). The app is simple to use: travelers select a restaurant, order, pre-pay and schedule a time to pick up their meal. When you arrive at the restaurant, your meal is freshly made and waiting for pick up. Should you decide to order more items, it is added to their AirGrub account. \n“Many travelers don’t have time to stand in a line or enjoy a relaxing sit-down meal, but rightfully they want delicious food for the concourse or the plane. With AirGrub, they can order the food they want from our menus while saving precious time,” said Michael Levine, CEO of Tastes on the Fly Restaurant Group. “We are pleased to work with AirGrub to bring added peace of mind to our guests.” \n“We are excited to be partnering with Tastes on the Fly and launch in San Francisco, where food, travel and technology are so intertwined,” said Surya Panditi, co-founder and CEO of AirGrub. “We all need to eat and sleep - when we travel, we don’t walk around looking for which hotel to stay at, so why wait until you are at the airport to decide what to eat? Tastes on the Fly’s commitment to great food quality and outstanding customer service, along with the convenience, time savings and peace of mind that comes with AirGrub, will improve the air traveler experience at San Francisco International Airport.” \nThe app is available on the iTunes Store and through Google Play. \nThe San Francisco International Airport is the first airport for AirGrub. Over the next several months, it will add additional airports and restaurants throughout the United States.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T22:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T21:26:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
