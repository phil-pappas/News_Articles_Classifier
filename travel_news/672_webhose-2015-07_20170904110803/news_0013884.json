Remnants of a suitcase Begue found near the plane debris. Source: AFP\nBegue is the supervisor of workers who maintain the paths to the beaches in the Saint-Andre area, keeping them from being overgrown by the lush tropical shrubs.\nHe said he called several of his workmates and they carried the wing fragment out of the water so that it would not be battered by the surf against the volcanic rocks that make up most of the beach.\nAuthorities wouldn’t comment Thursday on whether Begue was the first to report discovering the component. Colleague Teddy Riviere corroborated his account, and praised him for the discovery. Members of Begue’s soccer team kidded him on his new fame in local media.\nBegue said he also discovered a piece of a suitcase nearby. But it’s unclear whether there is any link between that and the plane part.\nFAMILIES REACT TO THE NEWS: ‘I selfishly hope this is not MH370’\nLooking for more ... People comb the beach where the plane debris was found. Source: AP\nThough authorities are still determining whether the plane piece came from Flight 370, Begue said last night: “We are going out in the morning to start making a memorial. We will use stones and maybe plant some flowers at the site.”\n“We want to show respect for the people who died,” he said.\nHe said he called Radio Freedom, his favourite station in Reunion, and the police after he found the wing part. And within hours the world came to the realisation that the aircraft debris on the desolate beach on the island of Reunion was possibly from Flight 370.\n“I was walking on the beach, looking for stones that are used to grind spices,” said Begue. “And there it was. It was very big, you couldn’t miss it.”\nBegue is still getting used to the significance of the find.\n“At first we didn’t know what it was. But now I understand. I am proud that Reunion is known for this big event.”\nEXPERT OPINION: Could ocean currents unlock mystery? Incredible find ... French police carry the debris.
