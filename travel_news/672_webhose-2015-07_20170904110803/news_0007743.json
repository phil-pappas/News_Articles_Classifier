The marketplace has postings like a one-year position for a regional digital marketing specialist in Singapore, and a three-month business development job in Düsseldorf, Germany. \nAfter she worked in public relations for several years, the recession hit. Out of a job, Canilao left the Bay Area for Paris, where she attended Ecole d'Art Maryse Eloy and studied graphic design for two years.

It has raised about $329,200 to date, according to Crunchbase . There are about 250 live opportunities on the site at the moment.
