It provides a translation of the existing drivers license into different languages, and provides some identifying information (photo, address, etc.). \nThe U.S. Government has issued warnings against scams for International Drivers Licenses (IDPs). Among the recommendations for business travelers to understand is that IDPs CANNOT be used in place of an existing license. They need to be used in conjunction with your license. The warning also states that if you present only an IDP as proof when stopped by a law enforcement official, you may be arrested. \nAccording to the release, only two organizations in the United States are authorized to issue IDPs: the American Automobile Association (AAA) and the American Automobile Touring Alliance (AATA). IDPs are only to be sold to people 18 and over with a valid drivers license. The cost is $15. \nIDP scams usually involve overpriced version of an IDP and false claims that the permit will allow people to drive in the U.S., even if they don't have a valid state license. They also (falsely) claim that the IDPs can used for photo identification purposes or used to avoid points on a license. \nAnyone with information on IDP scams should report them to the FTC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T14:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T23:53:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
