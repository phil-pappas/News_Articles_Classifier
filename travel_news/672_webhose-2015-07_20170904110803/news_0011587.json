The Sheldonian Theatre, located on Broad Street in the centre of the city, is available for a variety of conferencing options including lectures, plenary sessions, breakout meetings and drinks receptions. It is also a wonderful concert venue. \nThe Sheldonian was designed by Sir Christopher Wren and has been a central part of Oxford’s legendary skyline since it opened in 1669. The Theatre is the ceremonial hall of the University of Oxford, playing a key role in graduation and matriculation (welcome) ceremonies. The Sheldonian offers two spaces for conference organisers; the Main Theatre which can accommodate up to 750 delegates for a lecture or 250 for drinks receptions and the Cecil Jackson Room, suitable for breakout sessions and meetings for up to 80 people. In addition, the Theatre runs historical guided walking tours of the surrounding area. During the tour, visitors learn how the University was formed and hear all about its rebellious and violent past. Guests get to see landmark sites such as University Church, the Clarendon and Bodleian Quadrangles and Radcliffe Square before arriving back in the Theatre to hear about its origins and history. Tours include access to the Cupula at the top of the building where delegates can enjoy one of the finest indoor panoramic views of the city. Drinks package options are available to be booked afterwards in the main Theatre. Conference Oxford offers a free venue finding service, providing the easiest, quickest and best value way of arranging an event at the University of Oxford. It offers a one-stop-shop for conference and event bookings and also help and advice to those organising large conferences using more than one University venue. Kay Hogg, Senior Event Marketing Manager for a number of central University venue sites commented “It is fantastic that one of the University’s most iconic buildings will be added to the portfolio of college and University venues marketed by Conference Oxford. Delegates attending events at the University have the opportunity to enjoy many historic buildings in the city and we are excited that the Sheldonian Theatre will enrich many conferences in the future.” James Bennett, Chairman of Conference Oxford said, “I am delighted that the Sheldonian Theatre has been added to Conference Oxford’s offering. Such a celebrated building, which also boasts great accessibility and practical use, will no doubt be a very successful and popular conference venue.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T13:56:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
