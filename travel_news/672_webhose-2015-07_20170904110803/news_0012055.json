While only the most experienced mountaineers should attempt the trek to the 29,029-foot peak, Kailash Himalaya Treks , traversing the spine-chilling Khumbu Icefall, offers another way to see Everest. Take off at Kathmandu airport and head east, soaring over the Himalayas and alpine villages, as the world’s tallest peak slowly and dramatically comes into view. \nPlan Your Trip: Visit Fodor’s Nepal Travel Guide Photo Credit: Stepheng101 | Dreamstime.com Seattle \nWhat was once a major shipbuilding and logging hub has transformed into one of the country’s most sustainable and greenest cities, appropriately earning its title as The Emerald City. A modern skyline punctuated by the Space Needle and juxtaposed against the rising peak of Mount Rainier makes for the perfect backdrop as you hover over the city. Seattle HeliTours will take you past all of the major sights, including downtown, the Space Needle, Lake Washington, Ballard Locks and Ship Canal, Fisherman’s Terminal, University of Washington, and Elliot Bay Marina. \nPlan Your Trip: Visit Fodor’s Seattle Travel Guide Photo Credit: Courtesy of Sydney HeliTours Sydney \nConsistently listed as one of the world’s most livable cities, Sydney rewards residents and visitors alike with its rich history, beautiful architecture, lively arts and culture scene, and picturesque location along Sydney Harbour. The highlight of any flight over the city is sure to be a view of the iconic Sydney Opera House, opened in 1973 and designed to look like billowing sails anchored in the Harbour. Running flights during mornings and twilight, Sydney HeliTours will take you around the Harbour and as far outside the city as the eastern suburbs and beaches and nearby Blue Mountains. Adrenaline junkies should opt for the self-explanatory “Door off” tour of the city. \nPlan Your Trip: Visit Fodor’s Sydney Travel Guide Photo Credit: Andy Woods Fox Glacier, New Zealand \nThe eight-mile glacier stretches along the West Coast of New Zealand’s South Island, uniquely culminating in a leafy rainforest at its base. Easy accessibility makes Fox Glacier one of the most world’s most visited glaciers, and the surrounding area does not disappoint, with the country’s two highest mountains rising in the distance above expansive farmland. After a stroll through the sleepy Fox Glacier Township, take off over Fox and Franz Josef Glaciers with Glacier Helicopters and a landing on a stretch of isolated, untouched snow. Longer tours cover a larger portion of the Southern Alps.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T11:56:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
