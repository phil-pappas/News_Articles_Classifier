Who’s trying to avoid the wooden spoon?\nWe look at every club’s run home and their chances of playing in September with Fox Sports Lab in-depth analysis.\nCheck out your team and have your say.\n1. BRONCOS (30, +115 PD)\nBroncos in cruise control 0:34 Play video\nNRL: Brisbane are cruising in the NRL competition this season and now they can lay even further claims to cruising with a Brisbane river cat being unveiled in Broncos colours.\nFox Sports 13 Jul 2015 Sport/NRL Round 19 — Tigers (Suncorp)\nRound 20 — Titans (Suncorp)\nRound 21 — Sea Eagles (Central Coast Stadium)\nRound 22 — Bulldogs (Suncorp)\nRound 23 — Dragons (Suncorp)\nRound 24 — Roosters (Allianz)\nRound 25 — Rabbitohs (Allianz)\nRound 26 — Storm (Suncorp)\nBen Hunt is having another fine season for the Broncos. Source: News Corp Australia\nWe say: The Broncos are cruising towards a top two finish, with a relatively easy run over the next month. After that finals footy starts early, with the Roosters, Rabbitohs and Storm set to test their premiership credentials in the final three rounds.\nKENT: THE AXE MUST SWING AT NEWCASTLE\nFox Sports Lab says: Five out of eight at Suncorp Stadium gives the Broncos an excellent chance of finishing on top of the ladder, with the Storm their only upcoming opponent to have success up in Brisbane.\n2. COWBOYS (28, +34 PD)\nRound 19 — Sea Eagles (Brookvale)\nRound 20 — Eels (1300SMILES Stadium)\nRound 21 — Raiders (1300SMILES Stadium)\nRound 22 — Sharks (Remondis)\nRound 23 — Rabbitohs (1300SMILES Stadium)\nRound 24 — Warriors (Mt Smart)\nRound 25 — Storm (AAMI Park)\nRound 26 — Titans (1300SMILES Stadium)\nEverything we love about NRL 0:59 Play video\nNRL: Ahead of the 20015 Heritage Round we take a look at the best aspects of Rugby League\nFox Sports 15 Jul 2015 Sport/NRL We say: If the Cowboys can continue their strong road form with a win at Brookvale on Monday night, their easy following fortnight should just about cement a top four finish. After that, three tough matches against the Rabbitohs, Warriors and Storm will harden them for their best shot at a title since their run to the grand final in 2005.\nFox Sports Lab says: The Sharks, Manly and the Warriors are three of the Cowboys’ serious bogey sides and they travel to play all three. If they can two of those games, they’ll be close to guaranteed a top two finish.\n3. ROOSTERS (24, +138 PD)\nRound 19 — Warriors (Allianz)\nRound 20 — Tigers (ANZ)\nRound 21 — Bulldogs (Allianz)\nRound 22 — Knights (Hunter Stadium)\nRound 23 — Eels (Allianz)\nRound 24 — Broncos (Allianz)\nRound 25 — Sea Eagles (Brookvale)\nRound 26 — Rabbitohs (Allianz)\nBlake Ferguson has rediscovered top gear since coming back from injury. Source: News Corp Australia\nWe say: The Roosters couldn’t be in better shape to finish in the top four, and perhaps the top two. The furthest they travel away from Sydney for the rest of the season is a trip to Newcastle in round 22 and they play four of the bottom five sides.\nFox Sports Lab says: Despite what looks a relatively easy draw, the Chooks play four sides that they’ve had difficulty with in recent seasons — with losing records against the Broncos, Rabbitohs and Manly and a 50/50 split with the Warriors.\n4. WARRIORS (22, +27 PD)\nRound 19 — Roosters (Allianz)\nRound 20 — Sea Eagles (Mt Smart)\nRound 21 — Sharks (Mt Smart)\nRound 22 — Dragons (Westpac Stadium)\nRound 23 — Panthers (Pepper Stadium)\nRound 24 — Cowboys (Mt Smart)\nRound 25 — Tigers (Campbelltown)\nRound 26 — Bulldogs (ANZ)\nNathan Friend’s flipping good assist 1:33 Play video\nNRL: Tuimoala Lolohea may have scored the try for the New Zealand, but this assist from Nathan Friend speaks for itself. Commentators have named it the greatest piece of Gymnastics Rugby League you've ever seen.\nFox Sports 12 Jul 2015 Sport/NRL We say: The Warriors often sail through the Origin period but rarely do they sit within the top four with eight rounds to play. If they can win their four games in New Zealand and pinch one of their four games in Sydney they’ll almost certainly finish with a double chance.\nFox Sports Lab says: The Warriors are in good shape to qualify for finals long before round 26. However, they’ll have to be wary of one of their less threatening looking games on paper. Of the last 10 times they have played the Dragons, they have astonishingly lost all 10.\n5. RABBITOHS (22, +18 PD)\nRound 19 — Dragons (SCG)\nRound 20 — Knights (ANZ)\nRound 21 — Panthers (ANZ)\nRound 22 — Sea Eagles (Brookvale)\nRound 23 — Cowboys (1300SMILES Stadium)\nRound 24 — Bulldogs (ANZ)\nRound 25 — Broncos (Allianz)\nRound 26 — Roosters (Allianz)\nThe Rabbitohs will be relieved Greg Inglis made it through Origin unscathed. Source: News Corp Australia\nWe say: The Rabbitohs’ recent form is inconsistent but their next month is likely to determine what role they’ll play in the finals. It would take a brave punter to back against them making the top eight but if they fail to win at least three of their next four, it’s very unlikely they’ll be able to push into the top four, with four heavyweight opponents to finish the regular season.\nFox Sports Lab says: The Rabbitohs have a thorny run home but they’ve got no one to fear, with recent winning records against all bar the Cowboys and the Roosters, both of whom they’ve split the last 10 games down the middle.\n6. STORM (20, +26 PD)\nCameron Smith influence unstoppable 3:27 Play video\nNRL: Matt Elliott joins us in studio to take a look at the upcoming round of Rugby League\nFox Sports 15 Jul 2015 Sport/NRL Round 19 — Panthers (AAMI)\nRound 20 — Dragons (McLean Park)\nRound 21 — Tigers (Leichhardt)\nRound 22 — Titans (AAMI Park)\nRound 23 — Sharks (Remondis)\nRound 24 — Knights (AAMI Park)\nRound 25 — Cowboys (AAMI Park)\nRound 26 — Broncos (Suncorp)\nCameron Smith plays his 300th NRL game this weekend. Source: News Corp Australia\nWe say: The Storm have lost four in a row and are in serious danger of dropping out of finals calculation if they can’t find a turnaround in their form in the next fortnight. But if Craig Bellamy could hand-pick his next six games, he probably wouldn’t change the draw the Storm have been served up.\nFox Sports Lab says: They may be in ordinary form but if history repeats the Storm will march into the finals without any trouble. That’s no guarantee without a statistically vital cog in their side, Billy Slater, but the Storm have winning records against all eight of their opponents on the run home based on the last 10 clashes, with the Titans and Tigers surprisingly the biggest worries.\n7. DRAGONS (20, +22 PD)\nRound 19 — Rabbitohs (SCG)\nRound 20 — Storm (McLean Park)\nRound 21 — Knights (Jubilee Oval)\nRound 22 — Warriors (Westpac Stadium)\nRound 23 — Broncos (Suncorp)\nRound 24 — Panthers (WIN Stadium)\nRound 25 — Titans (CBus Super Stadium)\nRound 26 — Tigers (ANZ)\nBenji Marshall is set to make a welcome return for the Dragons. Source: News Corp Australia\nWe say: The Dragons need some troops back and fast. Thankfully for them Josh Dugan, Benji Marshall, Tyson Frizell and Joel Thompson are all slated to return this Saturday against the Rabbitohs because their form has started to become worrying. If they can start to get back to what got them into the top two leading into the Origin period, they’ve got the kind of draw which should allow them to hang on to their place in the eight.\nFox Sports Lab says: The Dragons have a 3-2 record against the Rabbitohs at the MCG in recent seasons, so a win in their Heritage Round clash could kickstart their finals charge. They’re 10-0 in their last 10 clashes with the Warriors and also enjoy clashes with the Titans and Knights, which should hold them in good stead.\n8. BULLDOGS (20, -14 PD)\nRound 19 — Eels (ANZ)\nRound 20 — Sharks (Belmore Sports Ground)\nRound 21 — Roosters (Allianz)\nRound 22 — Broncos (Suncorp)\nRound 23 — Titans (Central Coast Stadium)\nRound 24 — Rabbitohs (ANZ)\nRound 25 — Knights (Hunter Stadium)\nRound 26 — Warriors (ANZ)\nJosh Reynolds has started to rediscover his form. Source: News Corp Australia\nWe say: Just when you think the Bulldogs look like the team to beat they trip up and lose some momentum. The form fluctuations have to stop soon or the Dogs could miss out and their next two games give them a great opportunity to get up a head of steam. The last thing Des Hasler will be wishing for is a do-or-die game against the Warriors in round 26.\nFox Sports Lab says: The Bulldogs won’t relish their games against the Roosters, Broncos and Rabbitohs, who are all above them on the ladder and enjoy winning records over them over the last 10 matches. Somewhat surprisingly, the Knights are also a bit of a bogey side for Des Hasler’s men, so look out for that one if the Dogs are stuck on 26 points come round 25.\n9. SHARKS (20, -25 PD)\nRound 19 — Raiders (GIO Stadium)\nRound 20 — Bulldogs (Belmore Sports Ground)\nRound 21 — Warriors (Mt Smart Stadium)\nRound 22 — Cowboys (Remondis)\nRound 23 — Storm (Remondis)\nRound 24 — Tigers (Remondis)\nRound 25 — Eels (Pirtek)\nRound 26 — Sea Eagles (Remondis)\nBen Barba has rediscovered his best form off the bench. Source: News Corp Australia\nWe say: With four of their last five games at Remondis Stadium, the Sharks can set themselves up if they can snatch two of their next three games. With Ben Barba back in form and Cronulla’s forward pack close to full strength, a run to the finals looks increasingly likely.\nFox Sports Lab says: The Sharks have pretty ordinary recent records against all but one (Warriors), making the home ground advantage key. Even against the Storm and Cowboys, Cronulla have at least split their home clashes in recent years. If they can win all four home games, they’ll almost certainly make the eight.\n10. RAIDERS (18, +7 PD)\nRound 19 — Sharks (GIO Stadium)\nRound 20 — Panthers (Pepper Stadium)\nRound 21 — Cowboys (1300SMILES Stadium)\nRound 22 — Tigers (GIO Stadium)\nRound 23 — Sea Eagles (GIO Stadium)\nRound 24 — Titans (CBus Super Stadium)\nRound 25 — Panthers (GIO Stadium)\nRound 26 — Eels (Pirtek Stadium)\nBlake Austin has been a revelation for the Raiders. Source: News Corp Australia\nWe say: They’ve been a breath of fresh air in 2015, but despite assembling one of the competition’s most feared attacking units, the Raiders still have plenty of work to do to make the eight. Thankfully for Ricky Stuart and his men, the Raiders have a dream run home, with just one top eight opponent to play. If they can’t find fivew or six wins out of their last eight they probably don’t deserve to make September.\nFox Sports Lab says: The numbers say more about where the Raiders have been than where they’re going. Of the eight opponents they have left, Canberra only win consistently against the Eels. In recent seasons the Raiders have become too easy to beat at home, with losing records at GIO against six of their last eight opponents. The Raiders need to make midwinter their friend again and they’ll be every chance of emerging in spring.\n11. PANTHERS (18, -25 PD)\nRound 19 — Storm (AAMI Park)\nRound 20 — Raiders (Pepper Stadium)\nRound 21 — Rabbitohs (ANZ)\nRound 22 — Eels (TIO Stadium)\nRound 23 — Warriors (Pepper Stadium)\nRound 24 — Dragons (WIN Stadium)\nRound 25 — Raiders (GIO Stadium)\nRound 26 — Knights (Pepper Stadium)\nJamie Soward needs to stay injury free for the Panthers to make the eight. Source: News Corp Australia\nWe say: Penrith have got the majority of their injured troops back and there’s no more time to waste if they’re to make finals. Their crushing last start loss to the Roosters is food for thought but every one of their last eight games is winnable.\nFox Sports Lab says: The Panthers have recent success against the Raiders (who they play twice), the Eels and the Dragons but their recent clashes with the Storm and Knights make for ugly reading. Their finals fate could easily come down to round 26, which given they’ve lost seven out of their last 10 home games against Newcastle, would have to make them jittery.\n12. EELS (18, -38 PD)\nThey're eeling good at Parramatta 0:46 Play video\nNRL: Despite their salary cap dramas and the Kieran Foran contract saga, captain Tim Mannah says it's a very good environment to be in.\nFox Sports 14 Jul 2015 Sport/NRL Round 19 — Bulldogs (ANZ)\nRound 20 — Cowboys (1300SMILES Stadium)\nRound 21 — Titans (Cbus Super Stadium)\nRound 22 — Panthers (TIO Stadium)\nRound 23 — Roosters (Allianz)\nRound 24 — Sea Eagles (Brookvale)\nRound 25 — Sharks (Pirtek Stadium)\nRound 26 — Raiders (Pirtek Stadium)\nWe say: Parramatta have done extraordinarily well to put themselves in a position for a run to the finals, given all the off-field distractions they’ve had to put up with. But they could realistically be out of contention at the end of the next five weeks unless they can pinch at least two upsets against the Dogs, Cowboys, Panthers and Chooks.\nFox Sports Lab says: The numbers don’t look good for the Eels, who have losing recent records against every team they play against in the next six weeks. With all but the Titans and the in-form Sea Eagles below them on the ladder, it looks like a big ask for the Eels to make finals.\n13. SEA EAGLES (16, -50 PD)\nRound 19 — Cowboys (Brookvale)\nRound 20 — Warriors (Mt Smart)\nRound 21 — Broncos (Central Coast Stadium)\nRound 22 — Rabbitohs (Brookvale)\nRound 23 — Raiders (GIO Stadium)\nRound 24 — Eels (Brookvale)\nRound 25 — Roosters (Brookvale)\nRound 26 — Sharks (Remondis)\nDCE haunts the Titans 1:41 Play video\nNRL: Manly have handed the Titans a hammering in Monday Night Football with Daly Cherry-Evans reminding the Gold Coast exactly what they will be missing out on.\nFox Sports 13 Jul 2015 Sport/NRL We say: Manly are starting to find the kind of form that makes them a danger to any of the top sides and they’re considered genuine smokies to climb their way into the finals. But to do that they’ll have to win all four of their games at Brookvale and pinch at least two from their other four to get to the magic number — 28 points. In anyone’s language that’s a highly unlikely proposition.\nFox Sports Lab says: Of their eight opponents remaining, the Sea Eagles have winning records against seven if you look at the last 10 matches played. Only the Rabbitohs have won more than half of their games against Manly in their last 10 clashes. At least that stat should give the Sea Eagles confidence.\n14. TITANS (16, -89 PD)\nRound 19 — Knights (Hunter Stadium)\nRound 20 — Broncos (Suncorp)\nRound 21 — Eels (CBus Super Stadium)\nRound 22 — Storm (AAMI Park)\nRound 23 — Bulldogs (Central Coast Stadium)\nRound 24 — Raiders (CBus Super Stadium)\nRound 25 — Dragons (Cbus Super Stadium)\nRound 26 — Cowboys (1300Smiles Stadium)\nJames Roberts isn’t getting enough help at the Titans. Source: News Corp Australia\nWe say: The Titans are still a mathematical chance of finals, but to say that’s an optimist’s view would be to make a wild understatement. Five of the Titans’ last eight games are against top eight sides and at the moment they’d struggle to beat anyone — finals contenders or not.\nFox Sports Lab says: Hard to find solace for Neil Henry’s men in the numbers. On the form of the last few seasons, the Titans are a realistic chance of winning three or four of their last eight games at best, which would at least be enough to take them out of reach of the wooden spoon.\n15. TIGERS (14, -48 PD)\nRound 19 — Broncos (Suncorp)\nRound 20 — Roosters (ANZ)\nRound 21 — Storm (Leichhardt)\nRound 22 — Raiders (GIO Stadium)\nRound 23 — Knights (Campbelltown)\nRound 24 — Sharks (Remondis)\nRound 25 — Warriors (Campbelltown)\nRound 26 — Dragons (ANZ)\nMartin Taupau has been one of the Tigers best among an inconsistent bunch. Source: News Corp Australia\nWe say: For the Tigers, their last eight games are less about finals and more about development for the 2016 season and avoiding the dreaded wooden spoon. With games against heavyweights in each of their next three weeks, they could easily be in last position by round 22.\nFox Sports Lab says: Excellent records at Leichhardt against the Storm, at GIO Stadium against the Raiders and at Remondis Stadium against the Shgarks will give them some confidence they can win those three games but there’s not too much else in the numbers to give Jason Taylor and his players hope.\n16. KNIGHTS (14, -98 PD)\nNRL 360: Biggest loser of the round was the Knights 2:09 Play video\nNRL: The NRL 360 boys discuss the biggest loser of the round, the last placed Newcastle Knights.\nFox Sports 14 Jul 2015 Sport/NRL/Shows/NRL 360 Round 19 — Titans (Hunter Stadium)\nRound 20 — Rabbitohs (ANZ)\nRound 21 — Dragons (Jubilee Oval)\nRound 22 — Roosters (Hunter Stadium)\nRound 23 — Tigers (Campbelltown)\nRound 24 — Storm (AAMI Park)\nRound 25 — Bulldogs (Hunter Stadium)\nRound 26 — Panthers (Pepper Stadium)\nWe say: Newcastle look out of confidence and out of gas. Their season’s done and dusted. The only thing left to play for is to avoid the wooden spoon in Rick Stone’s first year back at the helm.\nFox Sports Lab says: The Knights have good recent records against the Panthers, Bulldogs and Titans, but with just three home games remaining, it’s tough to see them putting a run together.\nOriginally published as The run home: Can Manly make finals?", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/15/1227442/966269-a531233e-2ab1-11e5-a918-69a980c5d30d.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/15/1227442/967662-20cb7804-2ab3-11e5-a918-69a980c5d30d.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/15/1227442/965470-3999e790-2ab2-11e5-a918-69a980c5d30d.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/15/1227442/966412-0ede0054-2ab2-11e5-a918-69a980c5d30d.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/15/1227442/967610-01a6b5b0-2ab3-11e5-a918-69a980c5d30d.jpg", "http://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/the-run-home-schedule-and-analysis-for-all-16-nrl-clubs-between-now-and-september/story-fn2mcuj6-1227442967690", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/15/1227442/966358-f136a75e-2ab1-11e5-a918-69a980c5d30d.jpg", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content4.video.news.com.au/foxsports/prod/archive/2015/07/15/DVU_150715_NRL_HERITAGE_ROUND_PKG.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/15/1227442/967500-5fc3b3ba-2ab2-11e5-a918-69a980c5d30d.jpg", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content4.video.news.com.au/foxsports/prod/archive/2015/07/14/FSD_140715_NRL_PARRAMATTA_ON_FORM.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/15/1227442/967556-a16ad0c8-2ab2-11e5-a918-69a980c5d30d.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/15/1227442/967050-8472a388-2ab2-11e5-a918-69a980c5d30d.jpg", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content4.video.news.com.au/foxsports/prod/archive/2015/07/13/FSD_130715_NRL_BRONCOS_VSV.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/15/1227442/966325-bfcd308e-2ab1-11e5-a918-69a980c5d30d.jpg", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content4.video.news.com.au/foxsports/prod/archive/2015/07/14/DVU_NEWCASTLE_KNIGHTS.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content4.video.news.com.au/foxsports/prod/archive/2015/07/13/FSD_130715_NRL_TITAINS_MANLY_PKG.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/15/1227442/967078-bf2eaf94-2ab2-11e5-a918-69a980c5d30d.jpg", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content4.video.news.com.au/foxsports/prod/archive/2015/07/12/DVU_120715_NRL_WARRIORS_TRY_OF_THE_YEAR.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content4.video.news.com.au/foxsports/prod/archive/2015/07/15/FSD_150715_MATT_ELLIOT_STUDIO.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc"], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T10:22:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
