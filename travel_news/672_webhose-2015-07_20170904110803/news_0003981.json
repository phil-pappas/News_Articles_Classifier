A local Two Men and a Truck franchise has new owners and a hearty growth plan. Mike Lally and Robert Wallace have acquired the Huber Heights franchise of moving company Two Men and a Truck from David Malseed . Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, but Lally owns six other franchises in the greater Cincinnati and Louisville areas. Wallace serves as his GM there. \"It's a good fit for a location with our larger northern Kentucky and Cincinnati presence,\" Lally said. The local franchise currently has about 19 employees and five trucks, Wallace said. The new owners anticipate to grow the business by 15 percent to 20 percent per year as it adds additional people and trucks. With an aggressive plan to capture market share for the franchise, Lally said the hope is to capture 30 percent or 40 percent of the market share next year, a goal he thinks is \"absolutely attainable.\" That success will mean the company would hire 10 to 12 new people and grow its fleet to eight to 10 trucks. And that will also mean a larger footprint. The company is in talks with the landlord at its Brandt Pike office, with parking being its major challenge for growth. Eventually, Lally said the company will want to have some warehousing space and possibly another retail location. Two Men and a Truck has a separate South Dayton franchise on Dorothy Lane, which serves the southern half of the market. \"Our group of franchises is very much in expansion mode,\" Lally said. Randy Shacka , president of Lansing, Mich.-based Two Men and a Truck, tells me the expansion is being supported by the corporate headquarters, which is in the midst of a five-year plan to dramatically increase its reach. \"We've aimed to keep this company grassroots, and we've found that's the best best kind of marketing,\" he said. \"But people sometimes don't realize how far our reach is.\" The company has grown for 67 consecutive months and has 330 locations across the U.S. and three other countries. Its large reach has allowed it to work in residential moving, business relocation and city-to-city long-distance moving, he said. Ohio is its third largest state by number of locations and revenue. \nWant Dayton Travel news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
