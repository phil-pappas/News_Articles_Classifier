Hotels - Airlines - CVBs - Destinations - people U.S. Independence Weekend starts with a nightmare for 60 in Orlando, Florida Adv: \nJul 04, 2015 Adv: \nThe Independence Day weekend in the United States started Friday. It started with a scary beginning in Orlando at the Orlando Eye. It's the fifth tallest Ferris wheel in the world; just 13 meters shy of the London Eye. \nMore than 60 people had to be rescued from a 400-foot-tall observation wheel in Orlando which stalled due to a technical glitch. Riders were left hanging for more than two hours. \nThe computer system of the Orlando Eye, an observation wheel the height of a 40-storey building, malfunctioned around 3:45 pm, causing the attraction to automatically shut down, according to local Channel 9. \nA backup generator only got the wheel moving again around 6 pm. \nDuring the interim, a special team of firefighters was engaged in considering various rescue options, including airlifting. \nAlthough the gondolas eventually started moving again and slowly reached the ground, they still wouldnâ€™t open automatically. Firefighters had to use ladders to help people escape through hatches in the top.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T07:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T08:03:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
