During the hour of Iftar, packs containing food and beverages were distributed to cab drivers and Starwood’s partner-drivers at the main entrance of each hotel.\nCatering teams at each hotel prepared Iftar packs which included a diverse selection of food and beverage items. Associates from across various departments within the hotels, including Catering, Administration and Guest Services joined forces to bring the ‘Iftar for Cabs’ initiative to life.\nThe ‘Iftar for Cabs’ initiative – ideated by Starwood Hotels & Resorts – has been running since 2010 and has since become an annual tradition for many cab drivers throughout the region. The initiative has been widely appreciated by its hotel owners, the community and local transport authorities.\nRelated Posts 40% reduction in room rates in Grand Hyatt Taipei in July and August Worldwide study by SKIFT proves the high-quality of Qatar Airways’ 5-Star aviation experience Express your love this Valentine’s Day at Calabash Cove Resort & Spa Banana Island Resort Doha by Anantara set to woo travelers worldwide Melia Hotels International becomes a partner of the World Community Grid, initiative sponsored by IBM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T02:06:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
