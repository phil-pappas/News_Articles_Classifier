As far as I am concerned, attempting to stay young is almost a full time job in itself, so much so that it requires military-style planning to fit it all in. My working day starts at 6.30am, when I am in the gym doing weights , cardio, spin or circuits. When I get home, I embark on the second shift – nails, hair, tanning, depilation, massage and teeth, although not all on the same day. First of all it was just manicures. Now I have to somehow fit in a pedicure as well. I am aware that sunbeds are widely derided but extensive research has not unearthed any harm so long as they are used under supervision . Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, tanning on a beach (Rex) Regular tanning is essential as dead-white skin looks terrible on old people and it seems to get whiter and more pasty every year. Somehow, in the midst of all this, hair appointments have to be slotted in. Tinting, cutting and styling are long and expensive processes and take two hours at least. It is true that my hair looks a mess the very next day as the gym ruins it, so in between times I have to go for a wash and blow dry. The roots seem to show through with ever increasing speed and for me, grey is not an option. • 10 male celebrities who look better with grey hair • Make-up to avoid in your 30s, 40s and 50s Every day, I have to make time for make up, even if I am just sitting at home. I cannot bear to look at myself without it and these days I cannot leave the house, even to go to the gym, make up free. Mascara, eyeliner, tinted moisturizer and lipstick are my absolute minimum but I agree with Janet that too much make up can give a drag-queen look. Then teeth are a particular trial as you get older. Every now and again I have to go for whitening sessions, and just recently I had four crowns fitted. That took three long visits plus the painful extraction of four grand from my bank account. Where teeth are concerned, there is simply no choice as the alternative is either to become a toothless old hag or have a mouthful of brown teeth. Janet says it’s important to smile but you can only do this with confidence if you have nice white gleaming teeth. Liz in 2007, Liz now (Andrew Hasson/Andrew Crowley) Janet says she has not had cosmetic surgery, but I have. Six years ago I had a facelift and now I need more work. Next week I am going with a friend to investigate Botox. If I go ahead, that will cost me £200 every three months. It will mean yet more time and money, but I have seen the dramatic difference it makes to my friend. As I survey my wrinkly tummy, I am seriously considering a tummy tuck . But can I put myself through it, I ask? As you get older, there is simply no natural way of tightening up loose skin and eventually, surgery may be the only answer, depending of course on how vain you are. As it is, my battery of anti-ageing skincare treatments take up ever more shelf space in the bathroom, although I am not convinced that any of them make much difference. Clothes and shoes also become more problematic with age , and need careful thought. Some old ladies pad around in trainers all the time but I cannot wear flat shoes; they make me look too short and dumpy. So even at my advanced age I have to wear uncomfortable car-to-bar shoes in which I can hardly hobble. I don’t want to wear old-lady clothes but on the other hand, many styles are simply too young for me. This means endless time spent going round shops and online to hunt down the right look. Is it all worth it? Nowadays, I am a vintage car that needs ever more extensive bodywork. I could let myself become rusty and dilapidated with age but I rather at least try to present a shiny and polished appearance, whatever the effort.
