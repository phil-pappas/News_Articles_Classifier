Hotels - Airlines - CVBs - Destinations - people Canada strengthens air cargo security Adv: Lisa Raitt, Minister of Transport Adv: \nOTTAWA, Canada - The Honourable Lisa Raitt, Minister of Transport, today announced changes to make air cargo screening more efficient in Canada. \nApproved shippers will be allowed to screen cargo at any point in the secure supply chain—from the location where it is packed to where it is loaded on an aircraft. These changes will provide shippers with more flexibility and help reduce bottlenecks, move goods efficiently, and meet the highest security standards. \nTo benefit from these changes, shippers must apply to Transport Canada. They will be subject to a rigorous application process and, if approved, ongoing oversight and enforcement. \nThe changes to the Canadian Aviation Security Regulations, 2012, were published today in Canada Gazette, Part II, and will come into effect on October 17, 2016. In addition to bringing Canada in line with international shipping standards, they will help advance Beyond the Border—the Canada-U.S. Action Plan on Perimeter Security and Economic Competitiveness. \nQuick Facts \n• Approved shippers can include manufacturers, retailers, agents, freight forwarders, couriers, and air carriers. \n• In 2013, Canadian exports and imports transported by air were valued at more than $111 billion. \n• An estimated 8% of Canadian air carriers' revenue comes from transporting cargo. \nQuotes \n\"The Harper Government is committed to maintaining a secure and efficient air cargo system. These new regulations will allow for the secure, timely, and efficient flow of goods by air, while aligning Canada's Air Cargo Security Program with those of its U.S. and international trading partners.\" \nThe Honourable Lisa Raitt", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T03:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T04:05:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
