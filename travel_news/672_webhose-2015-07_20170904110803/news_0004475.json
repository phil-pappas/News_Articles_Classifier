Taxpayers face a bill of $415 million to cover the interest on the debt.\nTreasurer Tom Koutsantonis, in Sydney on Thursday for a banking roadshow, said although interest payments for the hospital would be covered by the Government under the Public-Private Partnership, the Government would not accrue the debt.\nFigures in the Budget Papers show SA’s bill for interest on its loans is scheduled to be $198 million this year, down more than $60 million on last year.\nBut this is forecast to rise to $415 million in 2016-17.\nSouth Australia is currently rated as an “AA” asset, trailing the triple-A states of NSW and Victoria since a downgrading in 2012.\nExplore the new RAH 3:33 Play video The State Government has released an animated walk-through of the Royal Adelaide Hospital.\nThe Advertiser 08 Jun 2014 News/SA This rating – determined by agencies based on the state’s economic performance – partly determines how much interest the state pays on its loans.\nIf SA and NSW both took out 10-year, $2 billion loans today, SA would pay around $10 million more in interest each year. Philip Brown, Senior Fixed Income Strategist at the Commonwealth Bank, said roadshows such as the Treasurer’s were important and if you “screw it up” and “the market as a whole forms a dim view of how you’re behaving”, it can mean governments pay more for loans.\nPeter Jolly, Global Head of Research at National Australia Bank, said the cost should be measured against current borrowing conditions, adding: “If you find a good piece of economic-enhancing infrastructure and governments can borrow at super low levels, in some ways that can make a lot of sense.”\nSteve Whetton, Deputy Director of the South Australian Centre for Economic Studies at The University of Adelaide, said higher borrowing costs were not necessarily a problem.\n“Where you’re having to borrow to fund your day-to-day operations, that’s OK if it’s only going to be a year or two,” he said. “But if that’s the long term trend, then you’re in trouble because the debt is going to get large and larger.\n“If you’re borrowing to fund infrastructure that is going to significantly increase the quality of life in the state or increase the productive capacity of businesses in the State, then it can actually often pay for itself.”\nMr Koutsantonis has previously described the state’s debt as “dramatically low”.", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content6.video.news.com.au/p1a3Q3bjpiPBgHJC56P24AObUDHyd3a0/promo226473864&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc"], "published": "2015-07-09T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T20:07:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
