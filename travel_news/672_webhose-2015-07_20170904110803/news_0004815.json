However, the best way to have a good time is to know the safest way to leave. Sounds like a buzz kill but actually it’s the opposite; once you feel in control of the dark walks home, you will be able to kick back and enjoy the good times as they happen. So here’s a quick guide to getting home safely on foot: Phone a friend On your way home, call your mum, dad or best mate. Shoot the breeze with them until you hit your doorstep so that someone knows where you are at all times. If you smell trouble you can manipulate the situation by saying things down the phone like “I’m about to be outside your house” or “you’ll see me any moment now because I’m just walking past the park”, to give the impression you’re less alone that you look. Hands-free Refrain from using headphones because they’ll dampen your ability to sense your surroundings. Similarly, if it isn’t raining, keep your hood down so you can see what’s going on around you. The more you cut your senses off the easier it will be for someone to take you by surprise. If it’s a long walk and you really can’t bear being in silence then use earbud headphones (the type you got free with your smartphone), and only put one ear in so the other is free. Even if it takes you longer, stay on the path that is lit rather than taking shortcuts down dark snickets Follow the light Even if it takes you longer, stay on the path that is lit rather than taking shortcuts down dark snickets. Stick to streets populated with houses, too, rather than dark, deserted alleyways. If you are walking along a road be sure to walk on the side of the road with cars travelling towards you, rather than moving in the same direction as you. You’ll be able to see a car approaching you and always be aware of what’s coming. When the cars are heading in the same direction then a quiet car can pull up behind you without you even being aware. Walk somewhere familiar, where people know who you are Don’t try take new routes or traverse into unexplored territory – the route you’re most familiar with will always feel the soundest. Similarly, make the most of your geographical community and walk through neighbourhoods you know, where the residents know you. Worst-case scenario: if you feel in danger you can knock on somebody’s door. Best-case scenario: you bump into a friend en route to your house and they can walk you home the rest of the way. Despite the fact you might feel uneasy, look brave. Walk tall, head high ... and keep an air of power Don’t be nervous Despite the fact you might feel uneasy, look brave. Walk tall, head high, taking strides and keep an air of power about you. Walking around like you own the place will give the impression you’re not someone to be messed with. The weaker you look, the more likely someone will want to take advantage of that weakness. What to do in an emergency If a robber demands you go to a cashpoint and withdraw money for them put your PIN number in backwards, the ATM will notice that the number is backwards to the one usually assigned to your card so it will still dispense your cash but it will also send an emergency alarm to the police who will come to that location immediately. If you’ve followed all the above advice and still run into trouble, you ought to be near enough to friendly civilisation to be able to scream for help. Don’t be afraid to make as much noise as it takes to get attention or scare the predator away. • Find more tips for studying, working and gap years on The Axis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T00:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T19:36:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
