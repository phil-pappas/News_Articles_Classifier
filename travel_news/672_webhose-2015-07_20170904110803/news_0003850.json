The introduction of the afternoon service allows us to offer more choice and is a quicker, more convenient alternative to road or rail.” \nThe new flights will complement the existing 06:40am, 10:35am and 17:05pm services from Leeds Bradford, and the 08:20am, 16:30pm and 18:35pm flights from Southampton. \nThe increased frequency will give Yorkshire business travelers flying to Southampton a greater choice of service. Yorkshire has strong business links with Hampshire and the south coast of England, particularly in terms of finance, insurance, IT, construction and manufacturing. \nEastern Airways has been operating scheduled services from Leeds Bradford since 2003, and also provides a regular service to Aberdeen in Scotland. \nTony Hallwood, Leeds Bradford Airport’s aviation development director, said: “The additional mid-afternoon frequency added by Eastern Airways will provide increased travel options for business travelers who are increasingly choosing to fly from Leeds Bradford to Southampton saving valuable travel time.’’ \nBoth Leeds Bradford and Southampton offer fast track security channels for all Eastern Airways passengers to avoid any security queues, enabling the airline to close check-in 30 minutes before departure. Complimentary drinks and snacks are offered onboard the aircraft and passengers are not charged for check-in, baggage or choice of seat. \nJan Halliday, Southampton airport’s director of marketing and communications, said: “This additional daily service will make life easier for business people travelling between the two regions. \n“It is also likely to be popular with cruise passengers from the north of England who join their ships in the port of Southampton.” \nOur analysis of Sabre Airport Data Intelligence demand statistics shows that an estimated 35,000 bi-directional passengers flew between Leeds Bradford and Southampton in 2014, a city pair also served by Flybe using larger Bombardier Dash 8-Q400 turboprops. This is a significant decline from the 60,000 -100,000 passengers being reported in previous years, albeit when Flybe offered significantly more seats in the market. \nThe increased schedules from Eastern Airways since it resumed non-stop flights on the route in January 2014 (it had previously served the market up until September 2011) has helped the carrier boost its own passenger numbers to above 20,000 last year, the first time it had exceeded that milestone since 2009. \neTN is a media partner for Routes.
