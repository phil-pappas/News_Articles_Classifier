How much luggage can I take onboard? \nStruggling to decide if you should pack that spare kaftan or if you really need that extra pair of heels? \nBefore you pack your bags, check with your Cruiseabout expert because there is no set policy between cruise lines when it comes to luggage. Don't get too carried away though – if you have to fly for your cruise holiday, you will have to stick to the airline's baggage allowance. \n2. What's included in the cruise price and what extras will I have to pay for? \nWith your onboard accommodation, three main meals a day and most of your onboard entertainment taken care of, most costs are paid for before you set sail. \nPort charges and taxes are often included but it does pay to check this with your Cruiseabout expert because it varies between cruise lines. \nAs a general rule, the only extras that you need to budget for are beverages, shore excursions, purchases at the boutiques and spa and any onshore shopping. \n3. Is cruising family-friendly? \nThere are so many cruises to choose from that it's just a matter of finding the one that's perfect for your needs. Ad Feedback \nFrom Broadway shows to lectures, libraries and a huge range of facilities such as gyms and sport courts, there is something for everyone. Many cruise lines also offer free kids clubs that are divided into different age groups – a guaranteed way to keep your children entertained day after day. \n4. Do I need a passport for a cruise that is leaving from Auckland but isn't actually leaving the country? \nEven though you're not flying overseas, you could still be entering international waters so make sure you enquire when you book your cruise. \nWhen you're cruising in New Zealand and not actually leaving the country, New Zealand nationals will not require a passport but you will need a government-issued photo ID with at least six months validity from your return date to Auckland. \n5. Will it be cheaper if I wait until the last minute? \nSometimes it is possible to grab an amazing deal at the last minute if you can be flexible with travel dates. However, if you're like most of us and you have to fit a cruise around work and school holidays or you have a strict budget, it pays to book in advance. \n6. How do we get from the port to our hotel? \nThe best course of action is to have your transfers pre-booked before you head off on holiday. Your Cruiseabout expert can arrange your transfers before you depart, providing you with a seamless experience without the worry of where to go or how to get there. \n7. Can we celebrate a special day on board? \nAbsolutely – some cruise lines will even treat you to a complimentary cake to honour the occasion! If you're celebrating a birthday, anniversary or any other special occasion, it can be as festive as you wish with champagne, flowers, canapes, wine or cheese. These added extras will need to be advised in advance and will be at an additional cost. \n8. What currency do we have to use and how do we pay? \nDepending on where they are based, most cruise ships operate in US Dollars, the Euro or Australian dollars. \nCruise ships are 'cashless societies' so when you order something onboard it is charged to your room and put on account, making it very easy and stress free. When your cruise comes to end, you can either settle your account with your pre-arranged credit card or you can pay with foreign exchange in the form of cash – as simple as that! \nTo find out more about booking the cruise of your dreams, visit www.cruiseabout.co.nz . - Sponsored content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T04:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T22:46:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
