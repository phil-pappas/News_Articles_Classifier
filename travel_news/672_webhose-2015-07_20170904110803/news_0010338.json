Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Jul 27, 2015 Adv: \nThis morning Fastjet launched their latest African destination out of Dar es Salaam, when flight FN209 took off at 0940 hours to Lilongwe, Malawi, with a full load of passengers, government, airline officials, and local media. The new route will initially be served twice a week every Monday and Friday. \nJimmy Kibati, Fastjet’s General Manager for East Africa, ahead of the maiden flight earlier today said: “Until now, it has been prohibitively expensive to fly between Lilongwe and Dar es Salaam. We believe that affordable fares on a direct route between the two cities will make it possible for more people in Malawi and Tanzania to experience the safety and convenience of air travel. We have worked closely with the governments of these two magnificent countries to establish this route, as we all agree that it will strengthen the trade, tourism and business sectors. Low-cost air travel stimulates economies in a number of ways, and we’re excited to contribute to economic growth in the countries we operate in.” \nRichard Bodin, Fastjet PLC’s Chief Commercial Officer, in the meantime tweeted “First Fastjet flight to Malawi today.” The low-cost carrier revolution spreading across East Africa’ a statement is true except for Kenya where aviation authorities continue to sit on two applications, one of Fastjet PLC to establish a Kenyan offspring of Fastjet and the other being the landing rights for Fastjet in Tanzania on the route from Dar es Salaam to Nairobi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T00:50:38.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
