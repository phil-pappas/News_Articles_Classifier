Many people do not know that they are not allowed on the plane,” said Brig Bin Lahej. \nHe urged the public to follow airline safety regulations and not carry dangerous or prohibited items. \nDubai Airports have a sign at the entrance indicating what is allowed on the plane and what isn’t, and people should consult that and remove any prohibited items and place it in a box in the airport dedicated for that purpose.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T22:25:25.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
