We arrived late in the day on bikes and the owner kindly agreed to us pitching our tent on the beach after a hearty meal.\nJon Fletcher\nJeep safari in Rhodes Explore the hilly interior and deserted west coast of the island by Jeep with Bumpy Rhodes Safaris , who will take you on an off-beat and off-road trip around the island in one of their rugged vehicles (from €40). You are picked up at various spots on the coast (including most hotels in the north and east of the island) and will head inland for an olive-pickers’ lunch at a mountain cabin.\nSalerio\nSyros Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Venetian quarter of Ano Syros, topped by the Catholic basilica of San Giorgio. Photograph: Alamy When visiting this cosmopolitan town with its marble streets and mix of modern and traditional restaurants, don’t miss the medieval Catholic settlement, Ano Syros , on a hill overlooking the city centre. Along Ano Syros’s whitewashed cobbled streets are some of the island’s best tavernas and handmade-souvenir shops. Go to the northern part of the island – by boat from Kini village – for stunning beaches and exceptional food; head to San Michalis village with the locals to enjoy sunset at taverna Plakostroto .\nGeorgia Manousou\nMacedonia region\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nymfaio, in Florina, Macedonia, Greece. Photograph: Alamy Nymphaio is a beautifully preserved mountain village. It has fresh cool air and no crowds, even in high season. Stay at Argyro guesthouse and enjoy stunning views, lavish breakfasts (homemade loukoumades and rosewater rice pudding set you up for a long day’s hiking). There is also a bear sanctuary at Arcturos environmental centre that cares for animals rescued from circuses and zoos in the region.\nRescue centre €6 for adults, €4 for children, arcturos.gr\ngaufreliegois\nHand Picked Greece food tours, Crete\nGreek ingredients on a foodie trip in Crete.

Personable enthusiasts we met at an olive farm – where you can also pick other vegetables from the garden – communicated their passion for food, wine and local life. The accommodation was lovely.\nEight-day olive harvest tour from £1,447pp, handpickedgreece.com\nHilaryRPhillips\nHiking on Santorini Facebook Twitter Pinterest Trekking along the Santorini Rim to Oia. Photograph: Alamy Start your 10km walk at the very pretty orthodox cathedral in Fira and head off along the cliffs towards Oia. The crowds thin after a while, leaving only you and serious walkers to be rewarded with stunning views from the caldera. In the mountains you’ll pass a small, isolated church in the Cycladean style and then head down into Oia – much photographed with its blue-roofed, round-domed churches – for a well-deserved beer.\nkeddieb\nRelated: Return to the Peloponnese: my Greek odyssey\nPeloponnese peninsula\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The beach at Kalogria. Photograph: Alamy Stoupa is the perfect base to explore the peninsula – it’s a holiday resort but also a proper working village with lovely beaches and gorgeous cooling waters running down from the mountains. Kalogria beach has gentle shallow waters perfect for children and a great vibe from the chilled-out backpackers.\nVeronica Murphy\nPylos, Peloponnese On the stunning south-west tip of the peninsula, this town has a wonderful main square, shaded by plane trees – excellent for coffee and people watching. The port area looks out to historic Navarino Bay. Add interesting independent shops, cheap restaurants and proximity to the Gialova Lagoon , the fort at Methoni and seaside resort of Finikounda , and you have all the ingredients for a true Greek holiday.\nsteveb1878\nPrivate Boat Hire on Zakynthos Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Blue Caves of Zakynthos.

For centuries, these little villages have lived on mastiha , a resin from the Pistacia lentiscus tree with a distinct aroma used to flavour sweets, cakes and liqueurs. Visit Pyrgi for its houses, covered in a unique kind of sgraffito , and Mesta for its stone houses, archways and perfectly preserved reminders of when it was fortified to resist pirate attacks.\nAlexander Breton\nQuiet Folegandros\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kimisis Theotokou church, Folegandros. Photograph: Alamy Less touristy and quieter than neighbouring Santorini (and only an hour away by fast ferry), this tiny rugged island feels like stepping back in time. Stay in car-free Chora – a town with picture-perfect squares and charming tavernas, all serving affordable and delicious local food. See an unforgettable sunset from the cliff-top Hotel Castro , then treat yourself to matsata , a local pasta speciality.\nPhoenix Kushner\nHomer’s tomb, Ios Facebook Twitter Pinterest Omiros tomb, Cyclades.

Photograph: Tally102/Guardian Witness Visit in the quieter months of September and October, when the nightlife winds down, and you’ll find a secluded paradise. Stay at luxurious yet reasonably priced Petros Place Hotel . At dusk, pick your route through the winding streets up to the highest point, where you will find magnificent sunset views over Ios town. For the freshest seafood on the island, the Octopus Tree taverna on the harbour side offers a laid-back atmosphere and simple, local dishes.\nTally102\nAgistri\nThe church near the harbour on Agistri. Photograph: Peregrin Hodgkinson/Guardian Witness This tiny island is one of the first you’ll see as you sail out of Athens. It’s a peaceful place that large cruise ships and mass tourism seem to bypass, and you’ll find crystal waters, clouds of butterflies and quiet beaches. Explore around the perfect little blue-domed church surrounded by the incredible aroma of Mediterranean pines that once provided the resin for local retsina wine.\nPeregrin Hodgkinson",
