An oasis in Olympic National Park, there's not one but a group of five pools. Indulge in a warm dip while contemplating the meaning of life. Just Dune It \nOregon Dunes National Recreation Area , Florence, Oregon Hit up the Sand Master Park in Florence, Oregon, and rent a sandboard for a nominal fee. Then hit up nearby Jessie M. Honeyman Campground in Florence to shred some serious sand. Places to camp for the night along the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area stretch a wide 40 miles.

Lakes For Days \nMirror Lake , Yosemite National Park, California Situated directly between North Dome and Half Dome in Yosemite National Park, Mirror Lake is the last remaining evidence of a large glacial lake that once filled most of Yosemite Valley at the end of the Ice Age. It's close to disappearing due to increasing sediment. For off-the-charts epic points, string up a hammock as you take in the sights of Yosemite's mirrored giants. \nLake Tahoe , Tahoe National Forest, California Backcountry and blackjack, bears and boating, skiing in the Sierras. Lake Tahoe in the Tahoe National Forest is a large freshwater lake in the Sierra Nevadas and a playground for adventurers of all types. Heck, you can even go on a brewery adventure to Tahoe Mountain Brewing Co. ! \nCrater Lake National Park , Oregon Oregon's only national park offers hikes from snowy heights to lakeside rims, cruises around Wizard Island, swimming in water as blue as Brad Pitt's eyes, and the opportunity to backpack 33 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail. No matter your reason, Crater Lake is an unmissable earthly anomaly in Southern Oregon's Cascade Mountain range and inspires visitors with starry skies, diverse wildlife, unforgettable landscapes, and the strong sense of being small in the midst of something grand.
