Hear from previous team members talking about what a Secret Compass expedition is really like and what to expect on one of their trips. Bristol, United Kingdom, July 11, 2015 --( PR.com )-- Secret Compass' new short film, Team Members Talk, marks the countdown to its expedition to mountain bike Ethiopia this October 11-24Adventure travel company Secret Compass runs expeditions to the world’s wildest places. Its MTB expedition aims to explore on two wheels the highest peaks in the UNESCO-protected Simien Mountains.In 2014, a Secret Compass team of riders scaled Ethiopia’s highest mountain, Ras Deshan at 4,550m, making them the first commercial company to have done so.In ‘Team Members Talk’, the men and women who were part of that pioneering world-first MTB mission describe their experiences.Team member and travel journalist, Tracey Croke, said; “Secret Compass takes average tourists like me and turns them into ‘explorists’– people who make history on their annual leave. I’m now one of the first two women to have mountain biked Ethiopia’s highest peak!”Team member Ross Hemingway said; “The Ethiopia expedition was unscripted, each day was different. The Simien landscapes resembled Dartmoor, then jungle, then alpine plateau – we then woke with frost on our tents. It even beat the Yorkshire Dales, which is impressive!”Tom Bodkin, MTB team leader and Secret Compass founder, said; “Secret Compass runs expeditionary trips, either into new places or to established destinations approached in a new way. We simply wanted to take mountain bikes somewhere they hadn’t been before.“Our international MTB teams comprise normal people who love riding and who seek to break wilder new trails, away from the crowds. Our next remote MTB expeditions to Kyrgyzstan and to Ethiopia are now in sight, in September and October respectively.”Ethiopia MTB Expedition: Fact Box· Promo film: Team Members Talk - watch here: youtube.com/watch?v=IGm6B1nX0Ww· Name: Ethiopia: MTB the Simien Mountains· Dates: 11 – 24 Oct", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T12:29:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
