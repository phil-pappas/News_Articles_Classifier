Looking \nAt the Musée Départmental Arles Antique sits an image of the Sphinx, watching. It's what she has done for millennia, overshadowed by the vast, dizzying architecture of the pyramids. This inspired curatorial decision raises enduring questions about the the act of looking; what do we notice? What do we pass over? Who are the gatekeepers? \nThe exhibition, Souvenirs of the Sphinx , showcases Wouter Deruytter’s collection of historic and contemporary images of the world’s most enigmatic sculptures. Curator Luce Lebart adds thoughts by Simone De Beauvoir - and others - which help generate further inquiry not only into how we see, but how the female form is seen. Interestingly, Deruytter actually climbed inside a sphinx for a closer look. \nWouter Deruytter, Renovation of The Sphinx by Dr Mahmoud Mabrouk, 10 November 1997 \n2. Collecting \nA show at Musée Réattu, titled Daring Photography: 50 years of avant garde collecting sends out a vibrant message to photography today. Fifty years ago, the first public photography collection in a French fine art museum began here. The seed, sewn by Lucien Clergue and Jean-Maurice Rouquette, germinated and grew into the Les Rencontres d’Arles photography festival. In this celebratory exhibition, it becomes easy to imagine an enchanted night in the museum, in which Cocteau and Colette might tango out of their respective frames, while Hemingway takes notes. The museum, to which Picasso donated a collection of 57 drawings, approaches photography as a valuable art, like painting or sculpture; a legacy which has permeated the reception of photography in France as a whole in recent years. Its cross-disciplinary approach also seems to have formed a cornerstone of thought in the mind of director Sam Stourdzé , for this his inaugural festival. \nYousuf Karsh (1908-2002), Ernest Hemingway, 1957 \n3. Multi-sensuality \nTwo things guaranteed in Arles: rosé and sensuality. Perhaps the former inspires the latter. Anyway, a highlight for me was standing outside Natasha Caruana’s Coup de Foudre , in the hope of witnessing a phenomena she had observed: people leaving her show and kissing passionately. What happened was even better, as a huge cheer went up in the square beyond and a glamorous wedding party advanced toward the venue. Much kissing ensued. \nFor her residency at Musée Nicéphore Niépce , awarded at last year’s festival, Caruana has used photography to investigate love at first sight; a concept in which she did not believe, until she was struck herself. Mixing staged photographs with illustrations of the heart from children’s biology text books, mounted onto concrete blocks, as well as displays of classic love texts on invisible shelves, Caruana sought to apprehend the power of love through science, literature and first hand testimony. This interdisciplinary weaving, like her previous work, is playful, fresh and thought-provoking. \nVincent Ferrané's Bienvenue, beautifully displayed in the Commanderie Sainte-Luce , offers a haunting, fragmented and lonely narrative of a woman wandering through the French city of Angers. A scene in which she tries on a silver bangle in a jewellers, brings a sense of touch into play - the cold metal encircling the vulnerability of the wrist - and is unexpectedly moving. \nVincent Ferrané, from the series Bienvenue, 2014 \nMartin Parr is not a name usually associated with sensuality, but the collaboration with musician Matthieu Chedid invites a different engagement, specifically, the opportunity to lie down on cushions, against the photographic backdrop of blue cocktails and white stilettos, while the viewer’s body vibrates with heavy bass from the speakers beneath the stage. An even more powerful musical vibration was to be felt at midnight in the picturesque Roquette quarter of the town, as a North African band left its audience quite spellbound. \n4. Radical print \nThe Riot Books imprint is one to watch. They lined the walk into the publishing atelier with a guerrilla pin-up of the book You Haven’t Seen Their Faces . This smart title, a play on Margaret Bourke White's 1937 book You have seen their faces, reverses the poverty found in Bourke's images of the rural South by presenting images of the 100 most powerful people in the City of London. The grainy images are covered with comments on hypocrisy and corruption, puncturing the usually pristine and safely anonymous world of the super-rich and powerful. \nFrom the same publishers, Vladyslav Krasnoshchok’s Negatives are stored in a small wooden box, filled with printed scans from negatives found in his native Ukraine. Colourful, intricate interventions onto the images reanimate a history without any particular logic or reason, but with wit and charm. It was also exhibited as part of Krzysztof Candrowicz’s Discoveries selection, where it looked a little lost. The book’s the thing (even if mine was later destroyed by a dog). \nUntitled, from the Negatives Are Stored series, 2012. Courtesy of Vlad Krasnoshchok \n• 60 inspiring photographs \nThe Dummy Book Award area was inevitably the most experimental. Two bodies of work by Monica Alcazar Duarte and Lewis Bush stood out. Alcazar Duarte’s original take on a representations of a Mexican town, Your Photographs Could be Used By Drug Dealers , is already in the collection at MOMA. Bush’s Numbers in the Dark is a very neat example of following an interesting idea and finding a way to make it visible - here short-wave radio stations used by espionage agencies. Both books push the limits of the form. \n5. Image and text \nI was delighted to hear Pauline Fargue won the Discoveries prize with her work No Day. The title comes from the writings of Pliny the Elder, in reference to the Greek painter Apelles, who let no day pass without a line - nulla dies sine linea. This was the second reference I saw in Arles to Pliny the Elder, perthaps we could cast him as the patron saint of photography (unreliable, made things up, offered rare insight). Fargue sees images and words as bodies and landscapes, which she harvests from her notebooks: 8,000 beautiful pages where notes, photographs and illustrations collide. She says it best herself: “Here the line is the tiny daily sentence, the stroke that crosses it out, the threshold of the landscape, the fold of the image, the tie that binds us: time.” I hope we see and read much more from her. \nUntitled from the No Day series, 2002-2015 \nA more conventional iteration of image-text is The Heavens: Annual Report by Paolo Woods and Gabriele Galimberti , which makes excellent use of extended captions to take a sharp look at tax havens. Crisp photographs of infinity pools and financial sectors show the high life, while the text tells the deeper story through statistics and pertinent details from the location. The moral implications of global economic policy reside uncomfortably in the spaces between. \n6. Animal magic \nWithout the traditional parade of fabulous beasts to signify the festival this year, I was heartened to see animal life still present. I sat inside a duck, based on the architecture of Las Vegas, and part of a very creative installation - Duck, A Theory of Evolution - by Olivier Cablat , encompassing film, archives, sculpture and books as well as photographs. I particularly enjoyed the ‘characteristics of pleasure zones’ report from Yale School of Architecture 1969, which, to my eye, consisted of big logos, phallic symbols and wedding chapels. We get the landscapes we deserve. \nBears were a feature of the Vernacular! exhibition from the Jean-Marie Donat Collection , curated by Jacinto Lageira. TeddyBär featured photographs taken in Germany between the end of the First World War and the late 1960s, where anonymous people pose alongside actors dressed up as polar bears. Other strands focused on images which include the photographer's shadow, and a collection of blackface photos dating from the 1880s to the 1960s. It’s always slightly unsettling to see connections like these. All three - bear, blackface and predatory photographer - exist and persist, like some kind of anima. \nJean-Marie Donat from the TeddyBär series \n7. Unexpected encounters \nRencontres is an apt title, not just for encounters between bodies of work, but for meeting people and actually talking with them. I didn’t send an email for three days. I did, however, meet Andy Sewell and see his lovely book Something Like a Nest , which takes a fresh look at the true landscapes of our lives; Polly Tootal , of whose dreamlike landscapes I suspect we will be seeing more; Francesco Pergolesi at Galerie Huit, whose tiny illuminated boxes of craft shops in Europe paid a charming homage to tradition. My visit to Little Big Galerie at the Off festival , after the intense d’Agata show nearby , was a treasure chest - the angel wings of Isabelle Levistre in particular caught my eye. \n8. Walker Evans: the photographer’s photographer \nWalker Evans: Anonymous is the keynote exhibition of the festival, and its subtle light radiates. David Campany's curation is disciplined and elegant, drawing out the breadth of Evans’ practice on the printed page. With each story, Evans invites the viewer to question the medium and its limits. His magazine work is less well known and warrants close study; not least his writing. From his wrecked car photographs, The Auto Junkyard, in Fortune magazine, April 1962, he notes: ‘There is a secret imp in almost every civilised man that bids him delight in the surprises and the mockery in the forms of destruction.’ He prefigured the contemporary tropes of \"ruin porn\", train journeys, subway photographs, office interiors, street markets and pictures of workers of which we have seen so many thousands thereafter. It’s hard to shoot it - or think it - sharper than Walker Evans. \nWalker Evans, Labor Anonymous, Detroit, 1946, for Fortune magazine \nMax Houghton is senior lecturer in photography at London College of Communication (LCC).
