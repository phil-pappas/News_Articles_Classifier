Nope, Uber is making a stand by using its most potent weapon -- its growing number of users. The first salvo came in an add campaign on local television and on websites that focused on five minority drivers. The intent here was two-fold: first, a direct message that Uber picks up passengers where regular taxi drivers often don't go; and an indirect one that Uber is putting a lot of New Yorkers to work. \"Millionaire medallion owners don't need help,\" said a man identified as Moises, one of five people in the TV ad who were identified as Uber Driver-Partners. He as making an apparent reference to the lawsuit filed by credit unions that fund medallion purchases of yellow cabs. \"People like us do.\" The second hit came later on Thursday, when Uber users checked their apps and found an interesting addition to the menu options on the bottom of the screen. All the way to the left, next to uberT and uberPOOL was one name -- DE BLASIO. The reference was, of course, N.Y.C. Mayor Bill de Blasio . To Uber, a San Francisco-based company that has a big presence in New York City, with bases of operation in Long Island City. De Blasio is among several city officials who are Uber opponents. This even though de Blasio has not really had much to say of late about Uber or the other car services that rely on apps to connect passengers with drivers. \nWant Albany Logistics & Transportation news in your inbox?
