Seeing as Orlando is the most-visited destination in the universe — seriously, are you going to quibble with me on that? — we thought it might be fun to share some insights from a new study by BMO Private Bank that takes a look at rich Floridians' travel habits. According to the study, wealthy Floridians — those with more than $1 million in investible assets — expect to spend 51 percent more on leisure travel this year than wealthy people in other parts of the country. In total, those Floridians expect to spend an average of $20,116 on vacations in 2015, including airfare, accommodations and food, the highest among the states surveyed and more than the national average of $13,249, the bank said. Seventy-two percent of those affluent Floridians prefer to stay in a four-star hotel, and another 19 percent favor a five-star hotel. Those numbers are about on par with national averages. Here are some other interesting stats from the survey: 61 percent of wealthy Floridians plan five trips or more this year, compared to the national average of six trips per year. The average expense per trip for wealthy Floridians is about $12,606, compared to the national average of $2,902. Nearly one-quarter of wealthy Floridians — 23 percent — choose to fly business class or first class, while three-quarters choose to fly economy. Florida’s wealthy residents tend to prefer to travel in the fall (77 percent), followed by summer (70 percent). Spring travel came in third, at 68 percent. More than nine in 10 — 91 percent — of the state’s affluent prefer to travel within the United States, while 42 percent said they travel to Europe.

Chiquita owes city of Charlotte $1 million in incentive payments As two Chiquita Brands International Inc. units leave Charlotte for Orlando and South Florida, Bill Cronin would like to remind the new owners of a pending bill. Cronin , Charlotte's economic development director, and other city officials said Chiquita owes Charlotte about $1 million in incentives that should be returned. The Chiquita relocation means the banana company has broken an agreement to keep the headquarters in Charlotte. Chiquita still owes a total of about $2.5 million in incentive funds to Charlotte and the state of North Carolina. State officials didn't respond to inquiries about whether Chiquita had begun to repay the debt, about $1.5 million of the total. Read more here . Big banks required to set aside more capital under final Fed rule Eight giant U.S. banks will be required to hold additional capital under a final rule adopted by the Federal Reserve to decrease the risk these companies pose to America’s financial stability. The new rule will apply to Bank of America (BAC), Bank of New York Mellon (BK), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS), State Street (STT) and Wells Fargo (WFC). These eights banks will be identified as global systematically important bank holding companies under criteria established by the rule. The banks will calculate their risk-based capital surcharges under two methods, and use the higher of the two results. Based on the most recent available data, these surcharges will range from 1 percent to 4.5 percent of each bank’s total risk-weighted assets. Read more here . How Lockheed saved big on its Sikorsky purchase Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) is saving big with its acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft Corp . — $1.9 billion in tax benefits, in fact. Bethesda, Md.-based Lockheed is set to purchase Sikorsky for $9 billion in cash from Connecticut-based United Technologies Corp. (NYSE: UTX), though the price is reduced to $7.1 billion because of tax benefits from the transaction. Lockheed is saving $1.9 billion in tax benefits because of Internal Revenue code that treats the transaction as an asset purchase, according to Lockheed’s release. As part of Lockheed, Sikorsky — makers of the Black Hawk helicopter — will fall under the Mission Systems and Training business segment it already partners with for projects like the Combat Rescue Helicopter program and the production of new presidential helicopters . Lockheed Martin has about 7,000 employees at its Central Florida units.
