Now in its second year, the Tudors at the Tower family festival takes spectators back to 1533 and the exuberant celebrations that marked the coronation of Anne Boleyn. Transformed into a Tudor world for the occasion, the Tower’s moat will serve as a den for costumed characters from the past and hosts various family activities such as candle-making and, perhaps more in keeping with historic practices than modern-day health and safety concerns, crossbow classes. \nAccess is included with general admission, which costs £21 per adult and £9.50 per child; under-5s free. \nIf that doesn't take your fancy, there are plenty of other options in the capital.
