A political committee supporting Governor Christie’s presidential run has raised $11 million since its inception in late February through the end of June and will begin airing television ads in New Hampshire, the group announced Tuesday.\nAmerica Leads, a super PAC that can accept unlimited donations, announced its fundraising totals ahead of the July 31 federal filing deadline. As of June 30, the PAC had $10.7 million on hand, according to the release.\nIt’s not yet known how much Leadership Matters for America, the political action committee Christie used to explore a bid, has raised and spent this year or what the governor’s campaign has collected since he formally entered the race on June 30.\nThe disclosure from the pro-Christie group comes the week after several other super PACs backing GOP presidential candidates announced their fundraising totals. Political action committees are not allowed to coordinate with campaigns, but can spend unlimited amounts in support of a candidate.\nRight to Rise, the super PAC supporting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign, announced last week it had raised $103 million in the first half of the year. Bush’s campaign has said it raised $11.4 million from the time he declared his candidacy in mid-June through the end of the month. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’ campaign announced earlier this month it had raised $14.2 million from his announcement in March through the end of June. And four super PACs backing Cruz have reportedly raised a combined $38 million. Businesswoman Carly Fiorina’s campaign also announced fundraising totals this month, saying she had raised $1.4 million since she announced in early May, while a super PAC backing her bid raised $3.4 million by the end of June. Conservative Solutions PAC, which is supporting Florida U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio’s presidential bid, announced last week it raised $16.1 million by the end of June.\nAmerica Leads said in a news release Tuesday that it is ahead of it’s fundraising goal.\n“We set a goal of raising $15-$10 million by the end of the calendar year, with roughly one-third of that to be achieved by June 30, and we are now well on our way to hitting and exceeding that benchmark,” said Phil Cox, director of America Leads, in a statement. “We have been judicious with our resources, spending only 3 percent of the money raised, which gives us the ability to begin communicating Governor Christie’s message to voters across the country.”\nWhile Cox said the group’s donors are diverse and come from across the country, the PAC did not release a list of contributions. That information will be detailed in the report it files with the Federal Election Committee at the end of this month.\nAmerica Leads announced it would begin a $1.1 million advertising effort supporting Christie on broadcast and cable in New Hampshire on July 20. The group has also reserved $2.8 million in air time in the first-in-the-nation primary state from November 16 through February 9 – the day voters head to the polls.\nChristie has been focusing his efforts in New Hampshire and returns there Thursday and Friday to hold town hall-style events.\nEmail: hayes@northjersey.com", "external_links": ["http://northjersey.mycapture.com/mycapture/lookup.asp?originalname=MC_christie.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-14T22:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T23:16:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
