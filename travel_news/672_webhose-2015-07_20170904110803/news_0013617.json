Airfare Watchdog This site has really come into its own, using real people to find hidden airfare gems. What I like about the site in particular is the blog with daily specials - some of them are truly hidden fares that are hard to beat. More » 3. Air Treks Around the world fares are the specialty of this site. Economy and Business fares are both offered, and you can build your own itinerary. They've created sample trips to give you an idea of what an around the world fare could look like. You do need to request more information so you won't have an exact price in an instant, but that's part of booking several different places to stop during your travels. What I like about the site is it fits a niche that many don't - looking at around the world airfares - so stopover options in several cities for the traveler that doesn't just want to book a simple roundtrip. More » 4. Airfare Dig Airfare Dig scours the internet for some of the best current airfare sales. Many of these specials are \"hidden airfares\", or unadvertised specials so they are harder to find and come and go very quickly. You don't book with them, but they list the rules and link you to where you can complete a booking. Their blog is not updated that often, but their home page is. What I like about the site is it is clear about it's mission - finding lesser-known airfare specials - so it can be helpful for finding deals. Its deal page also allows you to see if any of the deals they mention apply to the airport you may be traveling from. More » 5. Best Fares For passengers beginning travel in the US there are some truly great flight deals to be had for travel within the US, to Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean, and points beyond. Act quickly, deals don't last long. What I like about the site is there are pages you may not find on other sites like Wholesale Airfares to Europe , and also car and rail deals too. More » 6. CheapTickets A popular online booking site for discounted airfares and a good Last Minute Trips section. What I like about the site is it has lots of advertised airfare specials listed on the home page. Also, you can book things like concert and event tickets - so good for a one-stop-shopping experience. More » 7. Cheapflights The real strength of Cheapflights is that it has individual sites for a huge host of different countries. It lists deals, and gives you an idea of what kind of good airfares are out there. They are also pretty good at alerting you to airfare specials. What I like about the site is Cheapflights hand-picks airfare specials - and lots of them. They detail the rules of such specials, and unlike many of their competitors they have several sites for countries around the world, so you could be located in Austria or Australia and find deals from your country of origin. More » Has some similarities with Buzz (Kayak), with its simple design and seemingly endless list of search possibilities. It may not be the fanciest looking page, but this site is easy to use, and pretty fast for finding good airfares. What I like about the site is the simplicity of it - it's pretty easy to navigate. More » 9. Bing Bing has a series of arrows that accord with speculating whether an airfare will rise or fall and whether you should book, or wait to buy. There are risks inherent in this, but it is fun to see airfares treated a bit as if they are on the stock exchange. There are interesting tools too, including a fare comparison over a 30 day period. What I like about the site is it's kind of fun - especially figuring out all of the ins and outs of their Farecast technology - which includes searching multiple sites; checking the price predictor; comparing results; and then buying direct from the supplier of the airfare special. More » 10. Expedia One of the big players in online booking services - pretty good for finding decent airfares. They have deals listed on their home page and just a lot of different resources to peruse - might want to spend time on the site if you are headed over there. What I like about the site is that it has been around for a long time and has lots of travel and vacation options and traveler reviews as well.
