Maybe the much speculated SYD-HKG? That business suite just seems like drastic overkill working the triangle...\n0 report reply 1 1 hour, 40 minutes ago by Christopher Yeah I totally agree\n0 report reply 2 1 hour, 23 minutes ago by DK would this be an extra flight to HKG or they replacing the B747 with an A330?\n0 report reply 1 1 hour, 21 minutes ago by Christopher Replacing\n0 report reply 2 3 hours, 59 minutes ago by Christopher Currently only 4 newly configured A333s are flying although one may be ready next week.\n3 report reply 3 3 hours, 52 minutes ago by Chris_PER Perth to Singapore upgraded to A330 ;)\n2 report reply 1 3 hours, 16 minutes ago by Sim1 Wow... just saw a pig flying backwards and upside down...lol\nWe can live in hope!\n1 report reply 4 3 hours, 47 minutes ago by Angus i wonder what international routes qantas will introduce with the A330. i think maybe Beijing, Seoul etc.\n0 report reply 5 3 hours, 17 minutes ago by Sim1 The bit about A330s now all being configured to new overnight services isnt currently right.\nBooked on an A330 business next year and showing im in the old seating for a midnight horror flight. Sure it will change by then tho.. well i hope.\n2 report reply 1 3 hours ago by BeijingBogan The new seats are really nice. Sometime last month i had my SIN-MEL swap on me from new config to old at the T-6 day mark, and i promptly swapped over to SIN-BNE-MEL (the agent couldn't understand why i would detour) and i said, to try the new seats - and I have to say it's a pretty good improvement.\nYou've got good odds given your flight is next year.\n1 report reply 6 2 hours, 11 minutes ago by highflyer While I love the fact Qantas is rationalising all its flights and amending schedules to maximise utilisation, one has to wonder when will they start ordering more aircraft and not just keep \"rationalising\" schedules as there must be a point when they must need more aircraft.\n1 report reply 7 2 hours, 10 minutes ago by bodez Had been expecting this for a while, but suprised there is no mention of an east coast to DRW flight from this shuffle.\nWould love to see them take an SIN-Australia leg from Emirates with this re jig. Emirates could then run a SIN-AKL with a 777 instead on behalf of Qantas to tackle SQ/NZ on AKL-SIN.\n1 report reply 8 1 hour, 24 minutes ago by DK good news in a way, i'd much rather flying on the A330 from SYD-BNE over the 737.\n0 report reply 1 1 hour, 9 minutes ago by Sim1 Rather perth for a 4-5hour flight on an A330 than a short hour and a bit to brisbane\n0 report reply 2 1 hour, 3 minutes ago by franz It's excellent news.I won't be surprised should the rail link Adelaide to Melbourne disappear for good some of the Qantas flights on that sector are upgauged to the A330 TO MAKE UP for the loss of the Overland according to something I heard about on 7 news a few months back.If this happens it will be one of the few times since the TAA A300 ERA we have had wide bodies on that flight not including Grand Final Football weekends.\n0 report reply 9 44 minutes ago by Martin I wonder why QF will send the 330's to BNE from Sydney and not add MEL to the mix.", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/AusBT", "http://twitter.com/#!/djsflynn", "http://twitter.com/#!/ausbt"], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T10:32:11.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
