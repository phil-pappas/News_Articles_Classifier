The storm also brought lightning strikes directly above Cinderella's Castle, leading to striking pictures taken by visitors.\nKelsey Carragher, a visitor to the park who took one of the photos, said guests didn't seem to be frightened by the close bolts of lightning.\n\"The crowd seemed to be enjoying the lighting as much as they would have the fireworks,\" Carragher said.\nShortly after the storm, Disney World was able to continue with the special Fourth of July fireworks show, which was on Friday and Saturday.\nIt's a little stormy here at the magic kingdom\nA photo posted by @kelseyann635 on Jul 3, 2015 at 6:07pm PDT\nMaleficent is casting some evil spells at Cinderella's castle tonight at the Magic Kingdom. #waltdisneyworld\nA photo posted by andreapiel (@andreapiel) on Jul 3, 2015 at 5:51pm PDT\nLive from Magic Kingdom üôåüèªüò≠üíú‚ú®‚ö°Ô∏è #waltdisneyworld #wdw #magickingdom #lightning #cinderellacastle #livefrommk #livefromdisney #mk #disney #disneyparks #cinderella #waltdisneyworldresort #theskysawake #soimawake #disneygram #instadisney #igers_wdw #nbc6 #mynews13 #storm #takeme2disneyworld #orlando #florida #waltdisney1901\nA photo posted by üéÄMelanie 'Mellie' ElizabethüéÄ (@melaroo_) on Jul 3, 2015 at 5:45pm PDT", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/p/4sfkt9DFAR/", "https://instagram.com/p/4sc_jqnBef/", "https://instagram.com/p/4sdyGMui3m/"], "published": "2015-07-06T09:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T05:57:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
