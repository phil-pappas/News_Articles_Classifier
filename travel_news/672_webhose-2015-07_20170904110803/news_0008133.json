Home of the Day Giraffes at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in Colorado Springs Two zoos in Colorado have been named on a list of the nation's top 25 zoos. According to a ranking of U.S. zoos by online travel company TripAdvisor.com, the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in Colorado Springs ranks No. 6 in the U.S. and the Denver Zoo ranks No. 19. TripAdvisor commentators singled out the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo's giraffe viewing area as a zoo highlight. Last month, travel guide FodorsTravel.com rated the Denver Zoo is one of the top 10 zoos in the country. The top zoo in the country, according to TripAdvisor's rankings , was the San Diego Zoo in California. The Denver Zoo was partly responsible for tourism's banner year in Denver last year, when a total of 15.4 million people visited the area and spent $4.6 billion.
