But for those of you who want to learn a bit more about the wild and wonderful world of commercial aviation, I highly recommend reading the blogs below. They are informative without being so deep in the weeds that an average traveler couldn’t follow along.\n1. Cranky Flier Full disclosure -- Brett “Cranky Flier” Snyder and I have been friends since we worked together in the airline business back in 2001. He has worked for two airlines and -- no lie -- got his travel agent certification at the ripe age of 12. His blog is a snarky, humorous and informative font of information all about the airline industry. Some topics he’s covered include: the battle brewing between ultra-low-cost carriers Spirit Airlines and Frontier Airlines; and how United Airlines is doing a good job reaccommodating schedule changes.

She decided to leave her job at an aviation trade publication and take her strong expertise in passenger safety, comfort, connectivity and services to her website. She offers a great mix of free and paid content, and also uses her platform to promote women becoming leaders in aviation. More »\n3. Airfarewatchdog When people ask me what my favorite industry blog is, this one is always on my list. As someone who hates to pay full price for airline tickets, this blog and website offers great tips on the best times to buy fares and offers alerts on sales. It also offers some great travel tips for cities around the globe. More »\n4. Airplane Geeks Although the Geeks, led by Max Flight , use this site as the jumping-off point for their wonderful weekly podcast, the blog offers detailed show notes and links to topics discussed each week. The Geeks have a great mix of guests, from industry leaders to folks doing interesting things in aviation. More »\n5. The TSA Blog I have been reading this blog since day one. When I heard the agency was going to start a blog, I was skeptical. But thanks to the enthusiasm of Bob Burns, this site has become a real and timely source of information about the TSA. My favorite feature appears on Fridays, where Burns does a post on all the weapons screeners find passengers trying to get past airport security checkpoints, including: inert and live hand grenades; a stun gun that looked like a cell phone; a knife hidden in a lipstick; and a cane with a built-in sword. He also uses the blot to explain TSA policies and initiatives, and his team is always ready to respond in the comments section.
