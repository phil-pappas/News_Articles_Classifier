Child poverty will no longer be defined as 60 per cent of the average income but through a series of indicators including exam results and whether parents are in work. Mr Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, said the new approach was designed to bring about “meaningful change” in children’s life chances. However the Labour Party attacked it as the “obituary for compassionate conservatism” and said action rather than changing definitions was needed to tackle child poverty. David Cameron discusses changing child poverty target days before embarrassing figures released Coalition child poverty plan not ‘remotely realistic’ – Alan Milburn Government fails to agree on child poverty redefinition “The current child poverty measure – defined as 60 per cent of median income – is considered to be deeply flawed and a poor test of whether children’s lives are genuinely improving,” a press release announcing the change read. It said the government would focus on the “root causes of poverty, not symptoms” and said the current measure had been “criticised for failing children”. Announcing the change, Mr Duncan Smith said the measure had incorrectly suggested that child poverty was falling while the economy shrunk during the start of the last parliament. “Eradicating child poverty is an absolute priority for this Government, and I have consistently argued that it is not enough to tackle the symptoms without also tackling the underlying causes,” Mr Duncan Smith said. “The measures announced today are the foundation of a new, comprehensive way of addressing poverty and reflect our conviction that work is the best route out of poverty. “Our new approach will drive effective Government action by focusing attention on making meaningful change to children’s life chances.” Instead of relative income, the new legislation will look at the proportion of children living in workless household and the educational attainment of pupils at 16. The new law will replace Labour’s Child Poverty Act 2010. The government will also incorporate family breakdown as well as debt and addiction as it draws up a new “children’s life chances strategy”. Stephen Timms, the shadow work and pensions minister said of the announcement: “What is read out today is the obituary notice for compassionate conservatism.” Other Labour MPs claimed the move had only come because the government has “absolutely no hope in hell of achieving their child poverty targets”. It comes just hours after the four UK children's commissioners warned the government that child poverty in Britain was “\"unacceptably high\". In a report to the United Nations, the commissioners for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland warned planned cuts to benefits could push more young people into poverty.
