Medical researchers have found a 38-year-old fit and healthy man suffering from memory loss after local anaesthetic and root-canal treatment at dentist.\nThe man since the past decade can only remember up to 90 minutes and he awakes each day thinking it is the same day he went to the dentist. His symptoms are similar to those depicted in movies, such as ‘Groundhog Day’ and ‘Memento.’\nAs of now, there is no evidence that the treatment at the dentist can be blamed for his condition, but University of Leicester psychologists have described this as a unique case to science.\nResearcher Gerald Burgess said that one of their reasons for writing up this individual’s case was that they had never seen anything like this before in their assessment clinics.\nHe is now appealing for people who know of someone who might have suffered similar symptoms of memory loss, or medical or allied health professionals working with someone like this, to contact him in order to build up knowledge and evidence in this field of study.\nHe said that their experience was that none of their colleagues in neurology, psychiatry and clinical neuropsychology could explain this case or had seen anything like it themselves before.\nThe patient is fully aware of his identity and his personality did not change, but every day the man thinks it is the day of his dental appointment. He has to manage his life through an electronic diary and access to prompts.\nThe article is published in journal Neurocase.\n 26, 2015 4:42 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T22:21:52.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
