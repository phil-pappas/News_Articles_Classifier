The return service will depart Northern California at 23:25pm, arriving back into Sydney at 09:00am the following day. \n“The feedback from our customers since we announced the expansion of the Qantas and American Airlines alliance has been fantastic,” said Qantas International’s CEO, Gareth Evans. “They are thrilled we are returning to San Francisco, which is the most popular onward destination for Qantas’ customers travelling to the US.” \nThe only objector to the Qantas/American Airlines codeshare was Air New Zealand, as American also has plans to fly from Auckland to Los Angeles, which would break Air New Zealand’s monopoly on flights between the US and New Zealand. \nBoth Qantas and American Airlines have been through major restructures and are now looking for growth opportunities. \nQantas will have approximately 75 percent of the alliance’s capacity and American will have about 25 percent. The agreement also means American Airlines, which has 70 million frequent flyers, can now start marketing Australia to passengers in the United States. \nAbout 900,000 passengers flew from from Australia to the US last year, but only 500,000 in the opposite direction. \neTN is a media partner for Routes.
