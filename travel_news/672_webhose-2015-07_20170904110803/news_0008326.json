This is the latest in a series of boardroom conversations organised by BESydney to promote information sharing, robust discussion and collaboration across the city. Led by high-level government and business leaders, these discussions are a forum to debate and discuss the key challenges and opportunities for Sydney today and tomorrow. \nSpeaking at the roundtable, Lord Mayor Clover Moore laid out her long-term vision for a green, global and connected Sydney and the economic development strategies, reinforced by the state’s goals and supported by business and industry, that will underpin the Sydney of 2030. Lyn Lewis-Smith, CEO of Business Events Sydney, said that over the past two years BESydney and the City of Sydney have worked closely to win business events for the city and attract international visitors. She welcomed recent news that this partnership would continue, with the City of Sydney and BESydney entering a further five-year agreement through to 2021 to win further events for the city. “The events we win for Sydney directly contribute to the success of our city’s businesses and future economic growth, and our competitive advantage relies on strong alignment,” said Ms Lewis-Smith. “In the words of one of our guests today ‘We are all responsible for making this happen’.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T14:14:54.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
