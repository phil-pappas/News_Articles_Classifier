Furthering this bid for influence, an Aficionado’s Guide has been introduced to facilitate trip planning. \nContent everywhere Digital has transformed every product sector, but few are more suited to it than travel and hospitality. \nTravel decisions necessarily depend on information from a distance. Traditionally, this entailed consulting travel agents or friends, reading about locations in travel publications or watching an interesting program on television. \nAll of these options called for consumers to relinquish control, putting their trust in an external source, which sometimes led to discontent if a trip soured. \nDigital has drastically changed this equation by putting consumers back in the pilot seat, allowing them to pour through seemingly infinite content to devise their ideal trip and cross-check information. \nTo avoid being crowded out or overlooked in such an environment, hotel brands have had to hedge their positions with expansive digital content hubs and consistent online interaction. \nWhile St. Regis had satisfactory digital content in the past, the extension of Beyond to online channels bolsters the brand’s ability to appeal to consumers. \nConsumers may regard the wait as well worth it, too, since the new content hub is forward-looking with content seamlessly married to site design. \nSt. Regis Beyond homepage \nEven if St. Regis fell behind in the content race, the wait also benefits the brand because if it had rushed the online magazine, the site design may have suffered. \nThe online version of Beyond is image-centric and scroll-friendly. On the homepage, consumers can scroll through curated content such as articles on “Gaugin’s Polynesia” and Jane Goodall, art slideshows, food recommendations, videos, image galleries and a St. Regis map. \nSt. Regis Beyond content \nConsumers can also browse through categories: “Travel Tales,”“Fashion & Style,”“Art,”“Food & Wine” and “Our Destinations.” \nContent on St. Regis’ Beyond \nAlso accompanying this launch is “The Aficionado,” a separate Web page dedicated to showcasing the experiences that consumers can access at St. Regis properties. \nConsumers can narrow their search by region, passion and month of the year, or scroll through the experiences and wait for inspiration. \nSt. Regis’ The Aficionado content \nAll content is arrayed in a tile format reminiscent of Pinterest and also emphasizes images. \nThe Web pages and mobile and tablet apps will soon be available. \nVirtuous cycle Many brands have resorted to blitzing consumers with content in the misguided belief that abundance equals efficacy, according to a new report by L2 and Demandware. \nSeventy-two percent of North American organizations created more or significantly more content in the last 12 months, oftentimes at the expense of content quality, visibility and utility. The positive correlation between strong content and commerce is clear and brands have to be shrewd about content deployment or otherwise watch their investments languish in a crowded space ( see story ). \nOther luxury hotel brands have waded deep into the content fight. \nFor instance, Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts compiles top experiences from properties around the world for its “Extraordinary Experiences Collection” series. \nThe collection aims to immerse guests in a location’s culture, which inevitably leads to a wide range of potential options. Travelers have consistently professed that trips should entail original experiences, and luxury hotel brands are fundamentally shifting to meet this demand ( see story ). \nFinal Take Joe McCarthy, staff reporter on Luxury Daily, New York Joe McCarthy is an editorial assistant on Luxury Daily.
