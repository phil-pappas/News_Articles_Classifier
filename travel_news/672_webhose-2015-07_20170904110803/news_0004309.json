SeaWorld, San Diego \nIn a statement Peta alleged that a member of SeaWorld staff had been trying to “cozy up” to members of the organisation and had “repeatedly tried to incite animal advocates to act illegally.” \nSeaWorld has put the employee named by Peta on “paid administrative leave”. \nThe chief executive of SeaWorld Entertainment, Joel Manby, said: “The allegations made yesterday against a SeaWorld employee are very concerning. These allegations, if true, are not consistent with the values of the SeaWorld organization and will not be tolerated.” \nThe company has instructed a US law firm to look into the matter. \n“We will take all appropriate actions based on the results of the investigation to ensure that the integrity and values of the SeaWorld organization are upheld,” Manby said. \nThe company was hit by a wave of negative publicity following the release of critical documentary Blackfish in 2013. SeaWorld has always disputed the film’s findings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T11:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T12:18:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
