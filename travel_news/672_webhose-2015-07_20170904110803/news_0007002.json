This is what The New York Times reported after joining a tour of the prison that the Mexican government offered to journalists earlier this week:\nIt might seem odd for the government to offer a group of journalists a guided tour of the maximum-security prison where Mr. Guzmán outfoxed his captors. But the motive became apparent the further the tour delved: to show the extraordinary skill and determination required for such a maneuver. The layers of security were reminiscent of prisons in the United States.\nAs we’ve reported , Guzmán is the king of tunnels. U.S. law enforcement officials along the U.S.-Mexico border say he’s built dozens of them — right under their noses — to shuttle drugs on their last leg of the journey to U.S. markets.\nAt the Altiplano prison where Guzmán’s people built their latest engineering masterpiece, top prison officials have been fired amid suspicions that guards helped him escape.\nThere’s one more, small creature that also apparently helped El Chapo escape: Mexican officials discovered a dead bird in the trash can of the drug lord’s cell, the Times reported. They suspect the bird was used to test the air quality in the tunnel.\nThe deceased has been nicknamed “Chapito.”", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NMAtv", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/AS58aQj2fN8?feature=oembed", "http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/07/16/423434824/the-view-from-el-chapos-prison-cell-now-that-hes-gone"], "published": "2015-07-17T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T23:08:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
