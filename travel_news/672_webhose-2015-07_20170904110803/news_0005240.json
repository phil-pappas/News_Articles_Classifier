All lines have been placed on mute to prevent background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce Nadeem Velani, EVP, Investor Relations, to begin the conference. Nadeem Velani (EVP - IR): Thank you, Aaron. Good morning and thanks for joining us. I am proud to have with me here today Keith Creel, President and Chief Operating officer; Tim Marsh, Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing; and joining us today for the first time Mark Erceg, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I want to remind you this presentation contains forward-looking information. Actual results may differ materially. The risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could influence actual results are described on slide 2 in the press release and in the MD&A filed with Canadian and US regulators. This presentation also contains non-GAAP measures outlined on slide 3. The formal remarks will be followed by Q&A. In the interest of time, we would appreciate it if you would limit your questions to two. It is now my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Operating Officer, Keith Creel. Keith Creel (President, COO): Thank you, Nadeem. Let me start with wishing everyone a good morning. Thank you for joining us this morning. I know most of you sitting there now expecting to hear from Hunter, which you normally would. Although we may be from the same neck of the woods, as we say in the South, you obviously know that I am not Hunter. So with that said, Hunter can't be with us today. He recently had to undergo some minor maintenance procedures to his lower extremities. His recovery process has obviously been slower than I know that he hoped for, and although Hunter has many great attributes, patience is not one of them, as we all know. He knows one speed, which in our terms in the railroads is throttle 8, it's wide open. You combine that with the fact that he doesn't really take instructions well; he's not really accustomed to being told what to do, so he didn't exactly follow the doctor's orders with his recovery time. He jumped right back in the seat less than a week after his procedure. He's been very active since, especially last week, which, frankly, has impeded his recovery and finally his doctor has put his foot down and said no work, no travel. He has insisted that he take some time to fully recover to get back to 100%. I've spoken to him several times; I actually spoke to him yesterday a couple of times. He obviously trusts me and our team to carry on, which is exactly what we're going to do, so it's business as usual at CP. We expect him to return soon. In fact, I told him we would save him a boxcar or two for him to switch with his new and improved bionic legs when he gets back. I would also like to say a few words about the news this morning regarding our changes on the Board, including the appointment of Andy Reardon as our new Chairman, who is in town and was kind enough to take his time out of his schedule to join us here this AM. Welcome, Andy. I know that I speak for the entire Board when I say that we are extremely fortunate to have an individual the caliber of Andy Reardon become our new Chairman. 1 of 17", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T22:41:39.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
