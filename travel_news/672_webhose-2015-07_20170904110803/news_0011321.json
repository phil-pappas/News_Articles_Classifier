I knew there needed to be a “what next?” because while the foundation has had a lot of success, I felt it was time to step it up a gear. Fast forward a year to June 2015, and we’re at a pivotal point in moving the charity forward. \nWe have realised that to have the maximum positive impact in destinations, we need to work proactively, with partners who want to be involved in forward thinking projects, and critically, make changes themselves. To this end, we are aiming to work with visionary organisations who can help drive change, and not just be led. \nThe thinking of the past that it’s someone else’s problem must change if we really want to see travel become a truly sustainable industry. It’s not just the responsibility of tour operators, or agents, or local communities, or tourist boards, or airlines… you get the gist. We can only achieve change by working together. All tourism stakeholders have an impact, be it positive or negative, and what we want to do is help bridge the gap between all of these different groups. \nWe’re in a unique position of independence and are therefore well placed to facilitate cross-sector partnerships that will bring about positive impacts in destinations. \nTo put it bluntly, we want to work with those who can make changes, including destination governments, source market businesses and tourism businesses in destinations along with those who can help make it happen, for instance, academic institutions and other tourism bodies. Of course, this list isn’t exhaustive, but gives a flavour of who we want to work with in the future. \nThis approach will provide the building blocks from which we can scale up our work, to ensure we have a lasting impact in destinations. \nThe demonstration projects that the Travel Foundation has typically worked on in the past have proved valuable, both in the benefit on the ground and for our education. \nWe know what works on a micro level from projects such as jungle jams in Mexico where we have worked with a small community group to develop a business selling jams to the tourism industry in and around Cancun. What we want to do now is to increase the reach beyond supporting single community groups to building the frameworks that will provide the same opportunities for many communities. \nWith this in mind, we need to put the destination at the heart of our approach. After all, the entire industry relies on having great places to send customers to. We want to support destination stakeholders to develop activities that will optimise the benefits of tourism for those who live, work and visit these places. In doing so, we’ll create sustainable destinations that will exist long after our foundation’s work has finished. \nSalli Felton is chief executive of the Travel Foundation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T13:05:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
