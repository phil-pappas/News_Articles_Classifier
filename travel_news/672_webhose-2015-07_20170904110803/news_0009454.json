In the 20th century, Detroit was a thriving American city, leading the country in innovations in music, architecture and manufacturing. However, the city suffered a population and economic decline in the early 2000s. Over the past few years, the city has undergone an incredible transformation and Road Scholar is one of the only organizations that offer a comprehensive exploration of the city's comeback. Michael King, 77, is a recent transplant to the Great Lakes region. He and his wife, Jean, wanted to learn more about the state they now call home. \"We thought it was about time we visited more than just Detroit's Tiger Stadium,\" Michael King said. \"We're new to Road Scholar and found that it's the only organization with a comprehensive itinerary for Detroit. The museums are outstanding, Motown was a real trip and the Food Field farm was a true surprise. As new Michiganders, we are so proud of the people of Detroit and their commitment to bringing their city into the 21st century. Don't miss this one!\" The five-day program delves into the story of the Great Migration of African Americans who flocked to the city to work in the automotive industry and traces the origins of the Motown Sound and the musicians who made it. Local experts also detail how businesses large and small have taken on the entrepreneurial role of rebuilding Detroit and the dynamic energy of the city, the revitalized riverfront, newly renovated historic buildings and the spirit of Detroit moving forward. \"Detroit is undergoing an incredible transformation, and this new experiential learning program gives Road Scholars the opportunity to explore this transformation firsthand,\" James Moses, president and chief executive officer of Road Scholar. \"We are the only educational travel organization that enables participants to explore hidden aspects of the city and offers such an in-depth exploration of this signature American city.\" To learn more about Signature City Detroit: Motors, Motown and Moving Forward , please visit our website at: www.roadscholar.org/21851 .
