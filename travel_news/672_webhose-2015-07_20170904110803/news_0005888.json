The grand ballroom has a capacity for 1,000 people in a banquet setting and can be partitioned into three smaller spaces. Seven meeting rooms ranging from 21m 2 to 1660m 2 in size make LICC ideal for international conferences, product launches and fashion shows. \nEvents with overseas participants are well supported by a variety of accommodation options close by. LICC sits adjacent to The Westin Langkawi and is also managed by the hotel. Hotels located a short drive away include St Regis Langkawi which is slated to open in November, Bayview Hotel Langkawi, Adya Hotel Langkawi and Dayang Bay Serviced Apartment & Resort Langkawi. \nGanneesh Ramaa, manager of Luxury Tours Malaysia, said: “Meeting delegates will have plenty of accommodation options. LICC will also complement Mahsuri International Exhibition Centre and put Langkawi on the map as a MICE destination.” \nSaini Vermeulen, executive director of Within Earth Holidays, believes that LICC’s record of hosting high profile events will “make it easier for us to market Langkawi” to corporate clients and conference organisers. \n“The fact that the new LICC, with its state-of-the-art facilities, has handled high profile events will give confidence to meeting planners and MICE organisers that Langkawi is (capable). Planners interested in holding an event in Malaysia now has another option,” Vermeulen commented. \nHe added: “Also, Langkawi has the required tourism infrastructure such as attractions and restaurants to support the leisure components of a convention programme.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T10:50:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
