The RAF now has more spy aircraft tracking Isil militants than were deployed against the Taliban in Afghanistan. Another spy plane will soon begin flying reconnaissance missions over Syria within weeks, ahead of a potential Parliamentary vote on Britain joining air strikes on militants in the country. Michael Fallon is expected to tell an air power conference in London that the conflict is “a new Battle of Britain. Once again, against a fascist enemy prepared to kill civilians and opponents alike. “Our RAF are again spearheading the counter attack.” Senior defence sources said the RAF intelligence gathering effort over Iraq and Syria now surpassed that seen in Afghanistan during the lengthy campaign against the Taliban. Eight RAF Tornados based at Akrotiri in Cyprus have been flying armed reconnaissance missions over Iraq since September. A Rivet Joint spy plane packed with electronic eavesdropping intelligence equipment has also been flying over Syria from Akrotiri and will be joined by another this summer. All of Britain’s 10 Reaper drones are also in the area, as well as Sentinel and E3D Sentry and Shadow surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft. RAF Reaper UAV (MoD/PA) In total, Britain is providing around 30 per cent of the aerial intelligence gathering for the international coalition fighting Isil, Mr Fallon will say. His speech comes days after Mr Cameron said Britain could increase its Special Forces and fleets of drones and spy planes to intensify operations against Isil. The Prime Minister and Defence Secretary both want to step up the bombing campaign against Isil by taking part in US-led strikes against the terror group in Syria. Britain’s current strategy of hitting targets in Iraq, but not across the border, is “illogical”, Mr Fallon said earlier this month. Mr Cameron is expected to a call a Commons vote on the issue in the Autumn after trying to secure Labour’s backing for the move. The Government has faced criticism that its part in the air campaign against Isil has been “strikingly modest\" and “lamentably small”. Meanwhile, the Chief of the Defence Staff has said operations against Isil and elsewhere had stretched the RAF’s fast jet squadrons to the limit. Genl Sir Nicholas Houghton, admitted that current commitments had put the RAF at \"the very limits of fast jet availability and capacity\". The number of RAF fast jet squadrons has dropped from 30 at the end of the Cold War to just seven now. He said the RAF was now \"challenged\" coping with operations to defend UK airspace, deter Russian intimidation in the Baltic States, and beat back Isil in Iraq. But he agreed with the Prime Minister that more spy planes, drones and support for special forces were now a priority for the Government’s defence review. He said: “I cannot stress enough the need for a greater qualitative and quantitative investment in intelligence, surveillance and those capabilities that permit the precision application of hard power.” Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T02:54:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
