Monaco Convention Bureau was the recipient of the 2014 ICCA Best Marketing Award for its innovative marketing campaign to overcome existing stereotypes and reposition the destination. Famed for hosting global events such as the Monte Carlo Formula 1 and the Monte-Carlo Television Festival, the principality’s reputation as one of the world’s best event and conference destinations has gone from strength to strength since winning the award. Key partners such as The Grimaldi Forum Monaco, DreamCatcher, Incentive Concept, Lafayette Travel Monaco, Raising Stones Events and the Monaco Convention Bureau met guests to promote the world-class meetings, incentives and conferencing facilities in Monaco. After the presentations, a fantastic raffle delighted winners with prizes, including a Perfumer's Apprentice workshop at Fragonard in Eze, offered by Raising Stones Events; two return helicopter transfers for two people between Nice and Monaco offered by Monaco Tourist Authority; and stays at The Columbus Monte-Carlo, a choice of Monte-Carlo SBM hotels, and The Fairmont Monte Carlo. Stephan Roberge, Managing Director of the Monaco Tourist Authority in London, praised the event participants and his colleagues for their collaboration in creating such a successful evening. ‘We are thrilled with the success of the London showcase, which is such a wonderful opportunity to celebrate Monaco with our partners and friends here in the UK. Monaco may be the world’s second smallest country, but it is always evolving, combining tradition with creativity, exemplified this year with Monaco hosting the first Formula E European race. We are well known for our casinos and yachting, but have some of the best hotels, restaurants, conference centres and meetings spaces in the world, as well as incredible hospitality and weather. We love events like this showcase, because it brings a slice of Monaco to London and communicates to our partners how Monaco is always looking to the future’. Guests were wowed by the attention to detail across the space at One Horse Guards, which had been completely transformed specially for the occasion. The townhouse venue was fully decked out in the national colours of the Monegasque. Exhibitors, dressed in the chic red and white colours of the principality, embraced the opportunity to share upcoming developments with new and existing partners, and guests enjoyed the warm and glamorous Monegasque hospitality at the stunning One Horse Guards venue, which affords panoramic views overlooking the Thames from its outdoor terrace.
