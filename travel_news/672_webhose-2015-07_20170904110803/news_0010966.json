It’s said that the humble game of darts has its origins in medieval times, when King Henry Vlll told his archers to keep their eye in by practising both indoors and outside. So you may well feel the hand of history resting on the shoulder of your throwing arm as you head to the pub to toss a few arrows. It’s easy to see why darts has remained popular for so long. It’s simple to learn, doesn’t require great fitness levels – and its natural home is the pub. To join in, you can either hang hopefully around the darts board at your local or, if that sounds too random, simply invite some mates to gather round the board one evening. Darts is simple to learn, doesn’t require great fitness levels – and its natural home is the pub The rules of darts are pleasingly straightforward. You stand behind the oche (the line which is usually 7ft 9¼in or 2.37 metres from the board), and score points when you hit the marked, numbered section of the board. If you hit the thin outer section, you double whatever score it corresponds to. If you land in the even thinner inner section, you triple it. Hitting the outer bull scores 25, with 50 for the bull’s eye. You throw three darts each time and the most you can score on a single go is 180. Once you’ve mastered the basics and warmed up your throwing arm, you may want to shake things up a bit. Here are three variations you can put on a standard game of darts. 501 and 301 It’s the 501 version that you see in the big televised tournaments, but 301 is popular in pubs, too. Players start on 501/301, and aim to score points that get subtracted from your total with the aim of getting to zero in the fewest possible goes. The only caveat is that you need to throw a double to finish. Around the Clock You take it in turns with the aim of starting at 1 on the board and going completely around it in number sequence. Doubles and trebles are ignored. To finish, you need to hit the outer bull and then the bull’s eye. Killer This is a cracking game for large groups. It can be ruthless and usually the winner collects the pot you have all chipped into. Each player has three lives and the winner is the last person left with a life. You start by throwing a dart with your “bad hand” (if you’re right-handed, throw with your left hand and vice versa) to determine your number on the board. If your number has already been taken, you throw again. Each player tries to hit the double of their particular number. Once they do, a “K” is chalked against their name on the slate and they’re the “killer”. Your goal is to hit an opponent’s double points score and once you or any other ‘killer’ has done that three times, they’re out. Note, if you hit your own double after becoming a killer, you lose one of your own three lives! Smart tactics are key - a good strategy is to try to make your number far away from anyone else’s so that you don’t succumb to “accidental” hits when opponents are targeting someone else.
