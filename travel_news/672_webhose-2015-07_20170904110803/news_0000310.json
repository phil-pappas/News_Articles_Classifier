The country’s largest four exchange-traded funds that track blue-chips reported a total net inflow of about 10billion yuan on Monday, the same day the above remarks were made via the securities watchdog’s microblog account. The net inflow at such scale was rare, and showed that “mysterious” capital had moved to buy up at the market low, said China Fund News, a financial newspaper owned by People’s Daily . This raised the possibility of the purchase being made by Central Huijin Investment Ltd, the shareholding entity behind the country’s major state-owned financial enterprises. “Investors had accumulated a lot of gains in earlier times, therefore the recent decline could be seen as an adjustment after the rapid surge, which is the result of market mechanism,” said Zhang Xiaojun, spokesman for the CSRC. “Despite the loss, net-buy orders increased compared with that of Friday and the transaction volume has stayed at a relatively high level,” said Mr Zhang. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 3.3 per cent to close at 4,053.03 on Monday, extending the loss from its peak on 12 June to more than 20 per cent, while the Shenzhen Component Index slumped 5.8 per cent to 13,566.27. The margin financing and short selling activities have passed tests over the past two weeks and run normally. The risk is manageable According to the data from the CSRC, the average turnover at the two bourses over the past two weeks surpassed 1.2 trillion yuan, with another 255,000 new accounts opening on an average day to chip into the markets. Mr Zhang eased the concerns over leveraged investors forced to unwind their position in a written reply on Monday. “The margin financing and short selling activities have passed tests over the past two weeks and run normally,” he said. “The risk is manageable.” The fundamentals remain unchanged that reform dividends will continue to unleash under an upward economic trend, and that the market liquidity is abundant, said Mr Zhang, adding that the CSRC will accelerate the opening up of the Chinese capital market and encourage long-term investors, domestic and overseas. BlackRock Inc , the world’s largest asset manager, plans to start using the Shanghai-Hong Kong trade link, Bloomberg reported. The firm’s Hong Kong-domiciled China A-Shares Fund plans to invest part of an initial $60million via the stock connect after a round of successful tests, Marc Desmidt, BlackRock’s head of strategic product management for Asia Pacific, said to Bloomberg. The decision to use the link isn’t related to the latest market decline, Mr Desmidt said. The money manager already has about $1.5billion of quota to buy mainland shares through separate programs for qualified foreign institutions.
