The boxing match broke all money records for boxing, including tickets, sponsorships and pay-per-view subscriptions, ESPN reported.\nPhotos: Mayweather beats Pacquiao in 'Fight of the Century' >>Read more trending stories\nMayweather missed a deadline last week to pay a $200,000 sanction fee to the World Boxing Organization for the \"fight of the century.\"\nHe earned at least $180 million for the match.\nHe also didn't vacate his other titles with the World Boxing Association and the World Boxing Council as required. Mayweather is the junior middleweight champ in both of those organizations.\nCNN reported that WBO rules require boxers to hold titles in only one weight division.\nHe was given an extension to comply, but didn't pay or drop the titles. The WBO passed a resolution Monday to no longer recognize Mayweather as its welterweight champion.\nAccording to ESPN , the WBA and the WBC have similar rules against holding titles in multiple weight classes, but have not moved to strip their titles from Mayweather.\nMayweather has won 11 world titles in five weight classes during his 19-year career.\nHis next fight is scheduled for Sept. 12. No opponent has been announced. Mayweather has said that he plans to retire after that fight, ESPN reported.\nTrending on Facebook\nMan poses as armored truck employee, walks out of Walmart with $75,000 Former Disney employee killed after igniting fireworks on his head Video shows FSU QB Deâ€™Andre Johnson punching a woman in the face WATCH: Airborne crash stuns, injures fans at Daytona NASCAR race Paid vacation?
