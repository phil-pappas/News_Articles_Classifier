It covered all the medical expenses, and reimbursed us for a leg of the trip that we weren’t able to make due to the hospitalisation.” \nFrom lost passports and currency issues to medical assistance and flight cancellations, there are a number of travel emergencies that could crop up while vacationing abroad. Here’s how you can prepare for them and get assistance, if needed. \nWith inputs from Vikram Malhi, managing director-Asia, Expedia and Indiver Rastogi, chief operating officer and head - corporate travel, Thomas Cook Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T12:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T09:30:31.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
