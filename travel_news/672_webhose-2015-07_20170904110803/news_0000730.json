During its first year the company plans to hire 200 people in Costa Rica, including pilots, cabin crew and maintenance staff.\nThe company currently is in the process of obtaining approval from the Costa Rica Civil Aviation Authority.\nViva CAN will start by offering flights within the Central American region. It expects to launch later this year.\nThe carrier plans to offer rates at half the cost of its competitors. General manager of Viva, Joe Mohan, told daily La Naci√≥n that the carrier will offer rates as low as $100 for flights between regional destinations.\nRoutes during the first year will be operated using two Airbus 320-type aircraft and the company projects to be transporting some 250,000 passengers in that period.\nFuture plans include adding at least six more planes and expanding routes to North and South America and to the Caribbean.\nThe company is part of a conglomeration that also includes Viva carriers in Mexico and Colombia . Operations in those two countries started in 2006 and 2012 respectively.\nIts investors include the financial backers of low-cost European air carrier Ryan Air.", "external_links": ["http://www.nacion.com/economia/empresarial/Aerolinea-promete-boletos-mitad-precio_0_1498850128.html"], "published": "2015-07-11T08:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T21:41:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
