It was due to arrive at Heathrow Airport at 3:25 p.m. BST, but several hours into the flight, the captain announced to the passengers that they were being diverted because he received notice an \"unknown device\" was on the plane. \nPassenger Timo Berger was asleep when the announcement was made. He said the captain didn't say the word \"bomb,\" but flight attendants did. \nBerger said that shortly after the announcement, the plane descended to 6,000 metres. \n\"[They] told us if something happened, we would have breathable air and the effect of an explosion would not be so hard,\" he said. \n\"Some people were scared and afraid. Some people cried. But there was no panic on the aircraft,\" he said. Canine unit helps with search \nFlight attendants searched the plane while it was mid-air, hoping to find a suspicious device, but none was found. The plane landed safely in Montreal around 6 a.m. ET, and all 312 passengers disembarked safely. \nMontreal police's SWAT team and canine unit spent the morning searching the plane, passengers and baggage. \nA spokesperson for Montreal's airport authority said no bomb was found during the search. \nMontreal police cars on tarmac, exclusive #BA274 pictures sent to me by passenger #cbcmtl @CBCMontreal pic.twitter.com/mawtXzPJyV â€” @RebeccaUgolini \nPolice said the evacuation went smoothly and confirmed they received a phone call about 40 minutes before the plane landed. \nA spokeswoman for British Airways said the captain made the decision to divert the airplane as a precaution. \nThe airline said it will pay for the hotel rooms of people on the plane and will rebook flights as soon as possible. \nThe airline said it is co-operating with Canadian authorities. \nThe passengers are still in Montreal and will likely remain in the city until tomorrow. \nDog used in security procedures, exclusive #BA274 images sent to me by passenger #cbcmtl @CBCMontreal pic.twitter.com/MzXw6sWT7G", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T22:59:11.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
