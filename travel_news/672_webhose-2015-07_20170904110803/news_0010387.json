The coming of Obama to Kenya will see this African safari destination inviting a big number of the American presidential entourage to the big, international hotels in Nairobi. \nThe planned visit by Pope Francis in Nairobi is another testimonial of Kenya’s ranking profile among African states. Reports said the pontifical visit to Kenya would pull thousands of tourists and the global media to Nairobi. \nPope’s planned visit is scheduled the same month when 300-plus delegates from all corners of the working will be meeting in the Kenya capital to participate the ATA Congress, Africa’s high profile tourism networking and marketing forum. \nATA was established at the Kenyan capital in 1975 as anon-profit international travel with a mission to promoting travel, tourism and transport to and within Africa, and to strengthen intra-Africa partnerships. \nThe association serves both the public and private travel and tourism sectors, targeting international marketing networking for African countries, while connecting international travel and tourist industry players in United States and African counterparts including government tourism ministries, tourism, regional travel association, tourism boards, wildlife conservation trustees, airlines, among others. \nKenya offers an abundance of wildlife opportunities, as well as an astonishing diversity of landscapes and cultures. As the East African hub for tourism and air transport business, the country is known for its excellent domestic travel infrastructure and the wide range of tourism activities and services it provides for its visitors. \nFrom tropical forests and beaches to vast deserts and majestic mountains, tourists in Kenya can experience a different safari every day. \nATA Congresses provide a unique networking, learning, and agenda-shaping platform for Africa tourism stakeholders with partnerships to counterparts from the United States, Europe and Asia. \nThe 2015 program will include a line-up of educational and professional development sessions; a Tourism Ministers’ Roundtable; sessions to Meet the Ministers, Meet the Media, and Africa Meets the World, where buyers and suppliers will meet; visits to Nairobi’s top sites; and a range of networking events, including a Kenya Culture Night and ATA Awards. \n“Our partnership with ATA is very important as the U.S. remains a significant source market for Kenya. The Kenya tourism industry is looking forward to welcoming ATA delegates for a successful conference in November to highlight all the country has to offer,” said Hon. Phyllis Kandie, Kenyan Cabinet Secretary for the Ministry of East African Affairs, Commerce and Tourism.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T10:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T13:21:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
