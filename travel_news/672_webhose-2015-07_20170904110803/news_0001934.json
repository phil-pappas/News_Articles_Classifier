None was found with their bodies, and they didn't have a cellphone, he said.\nThe search began late Wednesday afternoon when a woman called authorities to say she had not heard from her father or son since Tuesday morning.\nA hotel manager where the two were staying said the pair left Tuesday morning to go hiking on the Mormon Battalion Trail, Hegstrom said. Officials believe the two were going to take pictures of the path between Gila Bend and Maricopa.\nThe trail was the route taken by a group of volunteers recruited by the U.S. Army to go to California in 1846 during the war with Mexico.\nGillespie was a science teacher at an alternative high school for pregnant teens and teen parents. Tucson Unified School District spokeswoman Vanessa Hernandez said Gillespie was a teacher for 23 years. He was not teaching this summer.\nSchool Principal Anne Dudley said Thursday the entire staff was in shock. She said Gillespie was always patient with students who faced the stresses of being a teen parent.\n\"He challenged them with high-school-level science classes. When kids struggled with it, he was right there to help them,\" Dudley said. \"Even though they weren't sure they could achieve it, he wouldn't take no for answer.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T12:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T22:09:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
