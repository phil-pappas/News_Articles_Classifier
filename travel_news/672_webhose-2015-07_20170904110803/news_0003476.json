Why would you do that? \nThe veil has been well and truly lifted on the glamour of air travel, thanks to social media. \nAt a time when drunk passengers routinely disrupt flights and the crew struggle to take control of their cabins , flight attendants are fighting back the only way they know how: by shaming bad behaviour online. \nAmong the most popular sites are #passengershaming on Instagram, and the #crewlife and #flyingfeet hashtags on Twitter. \nThe New York-based former flight attendant Shawn Kathleen, who set up the Rants of a Sassy Stew blog seven years ago and who invented the Passenger Shaming Instagram and Facebook feed , has more than a quarter of a million people subscribed to her feeds. \nKathleen receives hundreds of pictures of scantily clad, messy and inconsiderate travellers each week with most coming from other passengers. \n\"It's...great to see people reading all these stories because now there's photographic evidence that flight attendants are not making this up. It's right here in front of you,\" she told Buzzfeed. A photo posted by Passenger Shaming (@passengershaming) on Mar 31, 2015 at 8:10pm PDT \nDan Air, the name behind Confessions of a Trolley Dolley which has more than 73,000 fans on Facebook and Twitter, told the Daily Mail he is concerned about the growing number of incidents of cabin crew abuse caused by intoxicated passengers. \"Now we all enjoy a drink when we're going on holiday or catching a flight. But the states some people get into is appalling and the abuse we often get is unacceptable.\" \nHeather Poole flight attendant and author of Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads, Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers, said the crude behaviour of some passengers has made flying less pleasant. \"As long as passengers are nice, I don't care what they wear,\" she said. \"But I do kind of hate when they take their shoes off and walk around.\" \nShe told Buzzfeed : \"Air travel breaks passengers out from their normal lives. It's an extraordinary circumstance for most and so they tend to write and tweet and Facebook more than normal. Plus you're anonymous on the plane and that anonymity allows you to be your worst self.\" \"No flight is ever the same. You never know what to expect when you walk on board. And although sometimes you may uncover the worst of worst, the life of a flight attendant isn't \"just a job. It's a strange – but wonderful – nomadic life.\" Poole told the Daily Mail.
