Our cultural and natural heritage, our gastronomy and our lifestyle are assets that meet the expectations of Chinese tourists,\" junior minister for tourism and foreign trade Matthias Fekl said in an interview on Wednesday. \nTaking into account the cruises from French coasts to discover the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, France records \"several million Chinese tourists who come for a few days,\" he added. \nOver the last 12 months, the Eurozone's second main powerhouse, saw more than 2 million tourists from China, where the progress of the tourism business remains strong, according to Fekl. \nThe French official said that the French government was working to enhance accommodation services, to further highlight the country's appeal to encourage more Chinese to visit Paris, the most visited city in the world. \n\"Chinese tourists come to France to enjoy some of our products and our brands, which is why we are improving the tax exemptions procedures, payment terms and changing schedules and the opening days of our stores to facilitate purchases,\" he added. \nAccording to official data, outside Europe, China is France's second biggest tourist market in 2013 after the United States, with 1.7 million visitors and â‚¬600 million (US$656.5 million) of revenue. \nAsked about the security measures implemented to ensure visitors' safety, Fekl said \"some initiatives are being explored to work together,\" including a boost of communication tools to inform them of the needed information and safety precautions. \nViolent robberies targeting tourists decreased by 26% last year from 2014 due to France's efforts to boost security in Paris' main touristic sites, by increasing patrols, improving prevention measures and communication to enable foreign visitors to enjoy the best possible stay. \nWelcoming 84.1 million tourists in 2014, France confirmed its position as the world's most visited country with its landmark monuments, Riviera beaches and gastronomic art, Fekl said. \nLooking to this year, the government official was upbeat on reporting good performance. \n\"The duration of stays has increased, which is a good sign. That means that foreign tourists are well received and want to stay longer to discover our cultural and natural resources and live an experience,\" he said. \nWith the number of tourists in the world set to double, France hopes to record 100 million international tourist arrivals annually by 2020. \n\"France's target is to be totally in keeping with this new development, by promoting offers and the destination of France abroad... to ensure that tourists stay longer so that we gradually become the world's leading player in terms of tourism revenue,\" the junior minister said. \nFurthermore, promoting rural tourism was among the government's priorities to further diversify the domestic tourism activities away from the traditional and famous sites. \nTourism in France accounts for 7% of the national output and employs two million people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T06:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T15:32:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
