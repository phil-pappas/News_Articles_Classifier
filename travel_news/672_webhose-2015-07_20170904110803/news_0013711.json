So when headlines this past week in Seattle screamed his untimely passing from the fatal shots that echoed through the community, many of us stopped in our steps to ask, “Why?”\nMuch has been written about Donnie in the short time it has taken to accept tragedy in all its starkness. And, still, there is much more that will, and must, be written about him lest his selfless sacrifice be in vain.\nIf there is any meaningful action that could revive, or redeem, the beauty of a single, gentle life that offered so much, let it happen now.\nFor the many of us who thought we knew Donnie well, we did not. Somehow, that should be a crime.\nMost Read Stories Seattle police officer faces firing over arrest of man carrying a golf club Man killed by escort had axes, shovel, bleach; may be linked to missing women Alaska Airlines has 72-hour sale on fall travel to Hawaii Kirkland hunter defends acquaintance who killed treasured lion Cecil Seattle-area home prices hit wall in May Despite all that he accomplished, Donnie himself never imagined or lived long enough to see the day that showed how many lives he touched. How could he?\nThere was Donnie the savior. Donnie, our hero. Donnie, a mentor to the young, guardian of the old and protector of the weak. And, of course, Donnie, the loving friend who stopped pain and fear in a community whenever needed, but not when he was most in need.\nIt was, almost, as one of 4,000 immediate Facebook viewers expressed, that Donald “Donnie” Chin, descendant of early Chinese pioneers who fought against racism and expulsion, had managed to live the fantastic life of a modern-day Batman; and any city should be so lucky to prevent and rid itself of crime so conveniently.\nAnd then there followed the expected and cursory words of sympathy, silent until that point, from public officials and elected representatives, precisely dressed in retrospect and typically circumspect, when the most disbelieving and devastating news was delivered.\nYet, none of their words, not even these, for that matter, will ever bring Donnie back.\nDonnie Chin, Seattle hero and lifetime volunteer, was in the line of fire in the early hours of the morning on July 23, alone and unarmed. The eyes and ears, the heart and soul of a jewel city’s Chinatown-International District, were stolen in a flash.\nIf anyone deserved much more in the community and from a city, it was Donnie. Rightfully, there should be outrage and condemnation in Seattle at how this tragedy was not only senseless, but should never have been allowed to happen.\nWhile a city weeps the loss of its own son and community icon, the public and its officials should begin to ponder how many hundreds of thousands of dollars Donnie saved government and society by being one of its most effective and distinguished first responders for more than four decades. And they should demand to know how the priorities of a particular community could be so marginalized and displaced that such overwhelming neglect could be hung on the goodwill and last breath of a single person in the community.\nIn his honor, we must continue to maintain and support his original vision, to contribute to his beloved International District Emergency Center .\nStill, the greatest crime against the collective consciousness, if not shame, should be reserved for the very last: One of the wealthiest cities in the United States, today, can continue to find it entirely acceptable that its own citizens must live in fear in the International District at night.\nDonnie Chin gave us his courage and his life so that we might see, instead, that the city belongs not to a gang of thugs and outlaws, but to the good people of Seattle.\nIn our hearts and minds, always, Donnie Chin — once a hero, forever a hero.\nKenda Gee is producer/director of the documentary “Lost Years: A People’s Struggle for Justice,” which features Donnie Chin, Bettie Luke and Alan Lau of Seattle. He is a former visiting scholar at the University of Washington.", "external_links": ["http://www.seattlefoundation.org/npos/Pages/InternationalDistrictEmergencyCenter.aspx"], "published": "2015-07-30T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T09:03:24.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
