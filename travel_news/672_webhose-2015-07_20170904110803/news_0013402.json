Santorini in the Greek Islands. Kristy Muir \n1. Santorini, Greek Islands \nTHIS postcard perfect island in the Aegean Sea may be a popular tourist destination, but it has managed to maintain its island and quaint village feel. \nI have been fortunate to visit Santorini twice, the first time in 2007 with a friend and last year with my boyfriend. \nJust as it is depicted in the movies, whitewashed, cubist houses of its two main towns, Fira and Oia, cling to cliffs above an underwater caldera. \nThey overlook the clear sea and beaches made up of black, red and white lava pebbles. \nYou can have a quadbiking adventure around the island or just relax by the pool at any of the hundreds of villas on the island. Peyto Lake, seen from Bow Summit in the Banff National Park, Alberta in Canada. Kristy Muir \n2. Banff in Alberta, Canada \nWHEN it comes to Canada you can't go wrong. I could have made a top 10 list of my favourite places just in Canada. \nBanff falls within Banff National Park, which is one of the most beautiful places you will ever visit. \nMy favourite place, Peyto Lake (pictured), is just over an hour's drive from the township of Banff. \nThere is so much to see and do in this area, whether it is winter or summer. A few of my faves are the hot springs, Sulphur Mountain, and the Vermilion Lakes. You might even be lucky enough to see some wildlife, as grizzly bears often hang around Banff. Wai'anapanapa State Park, black pebble beach, in Hana, on the island of Maui, in Hawaii. Kristy Muir \n3. Maui, Hawaii \nMAUI is know for its beach resorts, diverse geography and outdoor activities including hiking, biking, windsurfing and snorkelling. \nSprawling Haleakala National Park encompasses the island's highest peak, Mt Haleakala, as well as the pools and waterfalls of Oheo Gulch, accessed via the scenic and winding Hana Highway. \nThe reason I love Maui, is because unlike Oahu, the island is less over-run with tourists and more untouched. Hiring a car is the best way to see the island, but also jumping on a day tour is a great idea too. My tip for anyone visiting Hawaii is do not take any sand, rocks, shells or pumicestone away from the island, or you will feel the wrath of Pele's curse. \nI made that mistake in 2012 and I had bad luck until I sent my keepsakes back to the island. Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia. Kristy Muir \n4. Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia \nPEGGY'S Cove is a small rural community located on the eastern shore of St. Margarets Bay in Nova Scotia. \nFounded in 1811, Peggy's Cove has only a very small population, some say it is as little as 40 people. \nYet each year thousands of tourists flock to the village to admire its unique landscape and take a picture of the lighthouse, making it one of the most photographed lighthouses in the world. \nThere is no shortage of history and eerie tales about this rugged, exposed cove. Over the years the people here have had their share of ups and downs, including the tragedy of Swiss Air 111 in 1998, in which 229 people perished off the coast of Peggy's Cove. \nThe village is near Halifax, which makes it a great destination for a short road trip. The Colosseum in Rome, Italy. Kristy Muir \n5. Rome, Italy \nWHAT more could you want from a city: culture, history, beautiful people and delicious food. \nThere is nothing you can fault this Italian city on and it is a place that you could visit every year for the rest of your life and never see everything it has to offer. \nIn Rome, the touristy sights are a must, but don't take up too much time. You should toss a coin in the Trevi Fountain, strike a gladiator pose in the Colosseum and eat some gelato on the Spanish Steps. \nIf you are in Italy in the summer, after that you will want to take refuge from the sun and any one of the museums in this city is educational and astounding. \nAll vacationers leave Rome a few kilos heavier, after indulging in its fine pasta, pizza and desserts, but eating your weight in Italian food is 100% worth it. Neuschwanstein Castle, Hohenschwangau in Germany. Kristy Muir \n6. Hohenschwangau, Germany \nHOHENSCHWANGAU is at the foot of the Alps in the Allgau area. \nThe township and it surrounds is straight out of a fairytale, with royal castles, mountains and a crystal clear lake. The two world-famous royal castles, Hohenschwangau and Neuschwanstein, overlook the village from their majestic positions. \nI stumbled upon this quaint village in 2007 while backpacking solo around Europe. An Aussie guy I met on the road, Joe, came with me to this special part of Germany. \nHiking and biking paths lead you through lush, green meadows and dark forests. Countless large and small lakes have given this area the name Ostallgau - \"lakeland\". There is no other place in the world like it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T02:17:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
