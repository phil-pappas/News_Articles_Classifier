From napping during flights, to safety issues, airline pilots responded, with Reader's Digest compiling it all in a feature of 50 secrets - 50 Secrets Your Pilot Won't Tell You.\nOf the 50 shared secrets , I've included the 10 that struck me the most.\nBernard van Berg/Stone/Getty Images 1. Behind Closed Cockpit Doors On the question of whether pilots sleep on the job...\n“Do pilots sleep in there? Definitely. Sometimes it’s just a ten-minute catnap, but it happens.” John Greaves, airline accident lawyer and former airline captain, Los Angeles\n2. This Happens All the Time to Gate Agents Too I chuckled a little when I read this one. When flights are canceled due to weather, it is not necessarily the weather you see in the departing or arrival city, but can be prohibitive conditions en route. As a gate agent, I do hear a version of this...a lot.\n“This happens all the time: We’ll be in Pittsburgh going to Philly, and there will be a weather delay. The weather in Pittsburgh is beautiful. Then I’ll hear passengers saying, ‘You know, I just called my friend in Philly, and it’s beautiful there too,’ like there’s some kind of conspiracy or something. But in the airspace between Pittsburgh and Philly there’s a huge thunderstorm.” Jack Stephan\n3. Breathe in, the Air is Clean up There I wrote a feature addressing the issue of recycled air on planes, and in fact, with the current filtration systems in use, many airplanes offer cleaner air than hospitals.\n“Cabin air is not as dirty as people think. A portion of the air is recirculated because that helps to reduce humidity. But it’s run through hospital-quality HEPA filters, and it’s actually cleaner than the air found in most public buildings.” Patrick Smith, commercial pilot and author, askthepilot.com\nArlene Fleming 4. Flying Short of an Engine Note that most commercial airplane types can be flown safely with one malfunctioning engine.\n“We tell passengers what they need to know. We don’t tell them things that are going to scare the pants off them. So you’ll never hear me say, ‘Ladies and gentlemen, we just had an engine failure,’ even if that’s true.” Jim Tilmon, retired American Airlines pilot, Phoenix\n5. The Safety of Babes in Arms Although in most cases, a lap baby is allowed until the age of 2, there is a call to end the practice of permitting infants under 2 to travel without his/her own booked seat. Patrick Smith comments on the issue:\n“Is traveling with a baby in your lap safe? No. It’s extremely dangerous. If there’s any impact or deceleration, there’s a good chance you’re going to lose hold of your kid, and he becomes a projectile. But the government’s logic is that if we made you buy an expensive seat for your baby, you’d just drive, and you’re more likely to be injured driving than flying.” Patrick Smith\n6. The Truth About Turbulence With turbulence bringing on anxiety in so many passengers, a pilot's take:\n“Pilots find it perplexing that so many people are afraid of turbulence. It’s all but impossible for turbulence to cause a crash. We avoid turbulence not because we’re afraid the wing is going to fall off but because it’s annoying.” Patrick Smith\nPublic Domain 7. Commenting on Safety - and Running on Empty This is the safety issue you hear grumblings of, but hope isn't true...\n“I’m constantly under pressure to carry less fuel than I’m comfortable with. Airlines are always looking at the bottom line, and you burn fuel carrying fuel. Sometimes if you carry just enough fuel and you hit thunderstorms or delays, then suddenly you’re running out of gas and you have to go to an alternate airport.” Captain at a major airline\n8. A Smoother Flight for the Fearful Flier This is a strategy for first time and nervous passengers I hadn't thought of but makes an immense amount of sense, particularly during summer months with active weather, and often less stable conditions in the air.\n“If you’re a nervous flier, book a morning flight. The heating of the ground later causes bumpier air, and it’s much more likely to thunderstorm in the afternoon.” Jerry Johnson, pilot, Los Angeles\n9. For Pilots, Lightning Can Strike Twice At the airport, there is usually a red alert when lightning is in the vicinity, and all activity stops outside. This choice is not available in the air, and a workplace safety hazard for pilots...\n“I’ve been struck by lightning twice. Most pilots have. Airplanes are built to take it. You hear a big boom and see a big flash and that’s it. You’re not going to fall out of the sky.” Pilot for a regional carrier, Charlotte, North Carolina\n10. Why You Really Shouldn't Use Your Cell Phone Inflight Passengers often grumble about not being able to use cell phones during flight, how it is safe. Great perspective from a pilot on this topic...\n“People don’t understand why they can’t use their cell phones. Well, what can happen is 12 people will decide to call someone just before landing, and I can get a false reading on my instruments saying that we are higher than we really are.” Jim Tilmon\nShare ", "external_links": ["http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/0/C/5/engine.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/I/I/a0124-000115.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/L/I/I/a0124-000115.jpg", "http://www.rd.com/home-garden/50-secrets-your-pilot-wont-tell-you/article186583.html", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/C/5/engine.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/0/8/Oilplatform.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/0/0/8/Oilplatform.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T19:41:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
