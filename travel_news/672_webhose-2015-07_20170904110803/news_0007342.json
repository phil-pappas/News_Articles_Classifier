Here, Chris Leadbeater reveals how you can cope with the chaos.\nSo is it going to be impossible to reach Calais for the next few months?\nPut it this way: France's key Channel port seems to have returned to the summer of 1346, when Edward III had it under siege. Mind you, it was the English causing problems then.\nTailbacks: Lorries have been backed up along the M20 in Kent as Operation Stack continues\nWhat exactly is happening?\nIn a nutshell: one ferry company, DFDS, has absorbed another, MyFerryLink – and the latter's employees in Calais have been striking over fears that up to 600 jobs may go. They've been blockading the port – last week saw huge delays on the Dover-Calais route.\nI sympathise – but I just want to go on holiday. Are all ferries cancelled?\nThe situation could drag on all summer. DFDS (01304 874 158; www.dfdsseaways.co.uk ) has suspended Dover-Calais services until further notice, and is running extra Dover-Dunkirk sailings. “We are not taking bookings on our Dover-Calais route until at least Monday, but we have diverted one of our Calais ships to our Dunkirk route, enabling us to run up to 32 daily sailings,” says Max Foster of DFDS.\nThe company is also allowing passengers with Calais tickets to swap to Dunkirk for free.\nIs Dunkirk massively out of my way?\nIt depends where you are going, but probably not. It sits 30 miles to the north-east of Calais. Sailing there will add an extra 30 minutes to your drive if you are heading south.\nCan I not get to Calais at all?\nYes. P&O Ferries (0800 130 0030; poferries.com ) is still sailing to the port – but the risk with booking a boat to Calais is that the gridlock which hindered last week could return.\nHow will I know if my ferry is affected?\nDFDS is keeping passengers updated via dfdsseaways.co.uk/disruption , and its Twitter channel @dfdsukupdafes. P&O's Twitter channel @Poferriesupdate gives regular details.\nWill my travel insurance cover any delays?\nMost policies cover industrial action – but check the small print.\n Taking the plunge: The spellbinding photographs that show... British tourist is arrested in Abu Dhabi for 'swearing at... Would YOU pay extra to be first off the plane? A quarter of... Cheers! Surprise for passengers at London City Airport as... Should I just take the train instead?\nYou could. Eurotunnel (08443 353 535; eurotunnel.com ), which runs from Folkestone to Calais, was hit last week when the strikers left burning tyres on the tracks – but services have been running normally this week. However, access to the Folkestone terminal has been impacted. The tailback of lorries waiting to sail from Dover – which has blocked parts of the M20 – is being managed by Kent Police as Operation Stack. Junctions 8-11 are affected. The Eurotunnel terminal is at junction 11A – so it may be best to check the Highways England site ( highways.gov.uk/news/breaking-news ) for the latest on the jam.\nGood grief. Can I not even get to Dover?\nYes. But it may be better to use the M2 and A2 until traffic thins out.\nSounds like I should avoid Kent entirely...\nWell, depending on where you are going in France, you could try the Normandie Express fast catamaran service offered by Brittany Ferries (0871 244 0744; www.brittany-ferries.co.uk ), which zips from Portsmouth to Le Havre in under four hours. Alternatively, the company runs standard ferry sailings from Portsmouth to Caen, Le Havre, Cherbourg and St Malo.\nShould I just go to Greece instead?\nWell, that's another conversation. But despite the financial drama, the situation there for tourists seems to be calm. Travellers should take plenty of cash with them in case ATM machines shut down – but the Greek National Tourism Organisation (GNTO; www.visitgreece.gr ) said earlier this week that it “does not anticipate any inconvenience to visitors' holiday experiences.”\nRead more: Visit Greece | The Official website of the Greek Tourism Organisation", "external_links": ["http://www.poferries.com/", "http://www.visitgreece.gr/", "http://www.dfdsseaways.co.uk/", "http://www.dfdsseaways.co.uk/disruption", "http://highways.gov.uk/news/breaking-news", "http://www.eurotunnel.com/", "http://dailym.ai/1GV5uha", "http://www.brittany-ferries.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-07-28T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T22:54:37.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
