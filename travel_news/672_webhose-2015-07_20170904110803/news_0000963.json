The two remaining slots can be used to serve either Dublin or Belfast. \nIAG is also in discussion with other airlines that operate long-haul flights out of the UK, the Netherlands and Ireland committing Aer Lingus to providing them with connecting passengers. \n\"These commitments adequately address all competition concerns identified by the Commission,\" the Commission said in a statement. \nThe approval comes after Ryanair agreed to accept IAG’s offer for its 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus. \nIreland’s minister for transport Paschal Donohoe welcomed the commission’s approval. He suggested that once it was confirmed it would have no effect on the connectivity commitments, the State would formally accept IAG’s offer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T13:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T13:13:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
