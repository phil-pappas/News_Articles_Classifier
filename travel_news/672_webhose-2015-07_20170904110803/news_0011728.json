Of course, the challenge is to get there first and this is no easy feat. \nThe Urubamba River flows snake-like through Sacred Valley. \nScaling the steep cliff would usually be an activity left to experienced rock climbers. However, the folks at Natura Vive Skylodge have built a via ferrata to get up and zip lines to get down. \nThe via ferrata – a mountain route equipped with fixed ladders, cables and bridges in order to be accessible to climbers and walkers – has been built for beginners as well as the experienced, so the hotel is accessible to all with a fair level of fitness. \nGuests are provided with a standard climbing harness, helmet, gloves and a via ferrata lanyard. Should a climber slip, they remain attached to a \"lifeline\", preventing a nasty fall. \nUsing a zip line to leave the hotel is less of a challenge. \nThe cliffside suites have four beds, a dining room, and, most importantly, a private bathroom with curtains in case you object to the condors taking a peek inside. \nThe bathroom is also eco-friendly, with an ecological toilet and sink. The beds have high-quality mattresses, cotton sheets, down pillows and quilts. \nPromising 300 degree views, the only discomfort you may feel is because of the height.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T04:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T06:52:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
