Money talk may be vulgar in some circles but, at long last, the value of the Sussex Stakes, whose honours board includes some of the great milers of all time such as Frankel (twice), Rock of Gibraltar, Giant’s Causeway, Warning and Brigadier Gerard, is commensurate with its undoubted prestige. Last year, when the race was worth £300,000 – although it was the defining mile race of the season that produced a fantastic finish and proved Kingman’s supremacy – it languished in 33rd place in the league table of British major race values; there were even three National Hunt races at Cheltenham that were worth more. Many things in the Victorian era were sturdy and built to last but, in the early years, the Sussex Stakes – for its first 37 years restricted to two-year-olds – did not appear to be one of them. The race was uncontested 25 times and included 14 walkovers, suggesting that race planning had amounted to little more than a long lunch in Goodwood House followed by a raid on the Duke of Richmond’s port, after which no one could remember why they had assembled in the first place. Since the Second World War, however, and in particular since the key dates of 1960, when four-year-olds were allowed to compete, and then from 1975, when five-year-olds were invited to join the party, the Sussex has become the definitive mile championship of the summer. This contest offers the first chance for the Classic generation – the three-year-olds – to pit their abilities against their elders over what is currently Britain’s most fashionable distance – thanks largely to the exploits of the brilliant colt Frankel, although Golden Horn is currently doing his best over a mile and a half to reverse that trend. This year is no different and, though ‘Duel on the Downs’ was first coined by the marketing men for Frankel’s initial foray against older horses in 2011, after Dawn Approach versus Toronado in 2013 and Kingman versus Toronado in 2014, we are back for another reprise, Duel on the Downs IV, on Wednesday. It will be the unbeaten and exciting Ballydoyle colt Gleaneagles versus the star French miler Solow, the five-year-old gelding who wowed so many with his authoritative Queen Anne Stakes victory at Royal Ascot in June. The two could not be more contrasting; Gleneagles is the Irish-trained 2,000 Guineas and Irish 2,000 Guineas winner, who never wins by much further than he needs to. He has an abundance of speed and a fantastic pedigree. He is potentially worth millions as a stallion once one of the world’s biggest breeding operations, Coolmore, who own him, decide to send him to stud. The Freddy Head-trained Solow, the best older miler on turf in the world, is a grey gelding with precisely zero worth at stud, according to the official assessors. There is no question in my mind that the new value attached to the Sussex has been responsible for attracting Solow. The astute Head nominated the race as grey’s next target before the sweat had dried on him following his classy victory in the Queen Anne at Ascot. After all, since it was opened up to all ages in 1975, Bigstone, in 1993, has been the only French-trained winner in a race not many have ever crossed the Channel to contest. Head has been responsible for some of the world’s best milers in recent years; Goldikova, Moonlight Cloud and Charm Spirit but, at five, Solow has been a late developer, only bursting on to the world stage when romping up in the Dubai Turf by four and a half lengths from The Grey Gatsby in March. Because of his breeding – by Singspiel out of a dam who stretched her winning to over a mile and seven furlongs – Solow even ran over two miles at Longchamp as little as 14 months ago, but he has since thrived back at a mile. He has also bucked another trend. Unlike a lot of horses who ran well on World Cup night in Dubai in March but have since been injured or failed to repeat that form, he has proved that he has a tough constitution to match his ability, by coming back to win a Group One Prix d’Ispahan in France and the Queen Anne. In any normal year, a dual Classic winner such as Gleneagles would have been the standout three-year-old and, despite his exploits, he is slightly in the shade of a wonderful Derby winner, Golden Horn. But he may be the better horse. He has been first past the post in all eight starts, his only defeat coming in the Longchamp stewards’ room last October. Aidan O’Brien, who has won the race four times, rates him the best miler he has ever had – a Giant’s Causeway with gears. Of course, only time will tell if this is as one-sided as Frankel’s victories inevitably were, or a hum-dinging epic between two closely matched thoroughbreds. But the Qatari cash injected into the meeting and, in particular, this race, means there is now more strength and depth to it than the obvious match within. Richard Hannon will run Toormore, for whom a Group One mile will surely fall his way one day, and Charlie Hills is likely to run his Jersey Stakes winner Dutch Connection who, despite two defeats by Gleneagles, is a close-up third best three-year-old miler in Europe, with only the French Guineas winner, Territories, separating them judged on his most recent form in the Prix Jean Prat. I am not sure how politics play out within Qatari families, but the sponsors’ cousins, Sheikh Fahad Al Thani and his brothers also plan to run the interesting Peter Chapple-Hyam trained Arod in the race. A little like Solow, he was campaigned over further last year, running a creditable fourth, but he has a long, raking stride, and now that connections have learned how to ride him – let him use his stride in front – he remains slightly unexposed back over a mile. He could yet be the surprise package and he will at least ensure that the race, carrying £1 million in prize money for the first time and taking place against one of the most scenic backdrops in sport, is no dawdle on the Downs.
