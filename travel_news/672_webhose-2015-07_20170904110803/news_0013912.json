(Kathryn Scott Osler/The Den\nIf you're craving a getaway, then today's your lucky day. And if you live in Chicago, Atlanta or Denver, then it's even luckier.\nFrontier Airlines is offering flights for as low as $38 in its \"Little Fares From Big Cities\" flash sale , which covers flights from late August through mid-December and runs until tomorrow, July 31.\nThe best deals we found include a $38 one-way flight from Denver to Las Vegas, a $39 flight from Washington, D.C. to Cincinnati and $99 flights from both Los Angeles and San Francisco to Chicago.\nThe sale includes many major airports, but there are lots of flights both to and from Chicago, Atlanta and Denver, making those prime places to book a ticket for a late fall or early holiday trip.\nHere's the catch: Blackout dates for the sale include Thanksgiving time, and the sale is for flights from Aug. 18 until as late as Dec. 16. Some flight deals exclude Sundays, and some exclude days of the week except Tuesday and Wednesday.\nThe bottom line is, you're going to have to be flexible and spontaneous to appreciate some of the deals in this sale.\nBut for a $38 flight? We think we can manage.\nAlso on HuffPost:\n ", "external_links": ["http://content.flyfrontier.com/ways-to-save/online-deals?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/30/are-you-a-good-traveler_n_6926080.html?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618"], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T17:24:12.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
