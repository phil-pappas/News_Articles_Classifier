As a result, the many strengths of Gatwick and the many challenges of Heathrow are underplayed, leading to a conclusion which we believe is flawed.”\nMcNulty added that he was still confident the government will side with Gatwick despite the final report.\n“The Airports Commission has made its recommendation and it is now for the Government to decide.\n“We are confident that when they do make their decision they will choose Gatwick as the best option for the economy and the environment, and - most importantly - after decades of delay the option that is actually deliverable,” he said.\nSome of Gatwick’s concerns are around the understatement of its strengths and Heathrow’s challenges. Gatwick believes the Commission has under-forecast passenger volumes, traveller benefits, air quality and deliverability.\nDavid Cameron said the government will make a decision before the end of the year.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe", "http://www.gatwickobviously.com/sites/default/files/downloads/lgw_initial_reponse_to_the_ac_report_14.07.15.pdf"], "published": "2015-07-14T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T22:17:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
