No security guard, no receptionist, no gallery director...not a soul. \nWe waited for some staff member to rush to us, even the janitor would have done, but no one. \nI could have walked out of the galleria with La Muta under my arm and no one would have noticed...perhaps. \nTOP STORIES ONLINE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T00:46:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
