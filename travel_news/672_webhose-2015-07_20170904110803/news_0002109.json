Besides low-season hotel rates (lots of nice hotels in the range of $100 per night, as of 2014), I love the pace and manageability of this winter festival, the largest in the world. \nEvents and activities take place around the city, which allows visitors to explore the gorgeous architecture and history of this walled city - the only one of its kind north of Mexico. \nTo further your kids' appreciation of snow and sub-zero temperatures, in addition to the Carnival, check out local attractions like Le Massif or Mont-Sainte-Anne or Valcartier Village Vacances , a giant snow park with slides, skating and snow rafting. Niagara Falls in spring sees tourism pick up and temperatures rise.

Visitors can get up close in a number of ways to the most powerful waterfall in North America and one of the most famous in the world. \nThe town itself is very touristy and doesn't ooze anything close to charm. Clifton Hill, Niagara Falls' main drag is theme-parkesque, brimming with bright flashing lights, gift shops, games, restaurants and other attractions. \nMy recommendation is to spend a night or two and move on. Luckily, plenty of other interesting stuff ( Niagara on the Lake , Toronto , Niagara Wine Region ) is in the area to round out your vacation when you've had your fill of souvenir shops and TGI Fridays. Rusticoville is in Prince Edward Island, Canada. Photo © Tourism PEI Live the Anne of Green Gables Story in PEI \nPrince Edward Island (PEI) is a delightful destination, especially if you and your kids are fans of Anne of Green Gables , L.M. Montgomery ’s landmark first novelabout a spunky red-haired orphan. The tourist region of Green Gables Shore is home to Avonlea Village, a recreation of the young protagonist's much simpler 19th century world. Period-costumed actors bring the village to life through interactions with visitors and performances. \nLess \"theme-parky\" is Green Gables, a provincial park with wooded hills and walking trails where Montgomery's relatives lived and where the author got the inspiration for the novel. The original homestead still stands. \nRound out your vacation by visiting dozens of other Anne-themed attractions but don't miss discovering other parts of PEI, which is famous for its cuisine, arts and crafts, heritage, scenic drives and friendly hospitality.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T20:28:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
