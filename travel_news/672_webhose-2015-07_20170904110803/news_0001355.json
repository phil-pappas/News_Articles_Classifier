There’s a reason the fitness band industry has taken off: these wristband trackers monitor your steps, calories, and activity levels, allowing even frequent travelers to stay on track while on the road. I’ve found they help me be more aware of how much I’m walking (instead of grabbing a cab) when traveling, and how well I’m sleeping. \nMost fitness trackers start at around $100, but there’s a new system in town: the Pivotal Tracker 1 from Pivotal Living costs only $12 per year. Included is a subscription for their app, plus a fitness band that’s shipped to you for $3. After your year is up, you have the option of renewing the app for another $12, at which time you’ll be mailed a new band. \nMy first thought, based solely on the price: it must be poor quality. But then I tried it, and it’s not–at all–which makes me wonder about the mark-up on that fitness band I already bought for far more money (more on that below). The Pivotal Tracker 1 is a basic fitness tracker, yes, but the band is of decent quality and the app is very user friendly and visually appealing. \nHere’s what the Pivotal Tracker 1 includes (and what it can do for you): step counter activity tracker (how many active minutes in your day) sleep tracker (quality and length) easy-to-read OLED screen on the band calories burned syncs to app when band button is clicked and app is swiped be social: you can join a network and compare stats set goals (but they have to be manually updated) easy to tell what ‘mode’ it’s in because of the visual display can set alarms measurements can be changed (to/from metric) \nWhat it can’t do: track nutrition and calories in band is not waterproof (though it’s water resistant) sync without any effort band isn’t as comfortable as more expensive models no desktop dashboard \nAs mentioned, the included app is easy to use. It does take a few steps to sync the band to the app (you’ll need to make sure the band is ‘awake’ and then swipe the app), and you need to use bluetooth. You need to sync at least every 2-3 days, because the band only stores info for three days. The app will store your info comprehensively. You’ll need to take the band off to shower, and it’s not the prettiest on the market (but perfectly nondescript). The battery life for the band is very decent: I’ve only need to recharge (with included cable) about every 4-5 days. \nHere’s a screen shot of my app dashboard on a random day. Ignore the terrible sleep quality…seems to be the story of my life! \nHow does the Pivotal Tracker 1 compare to the more expensive fitness bands out there? I can compare it directly to the Fitbit Flex, which is similar in features (tracks steps and calories, but not heart rate). The Fitbit band is softer and therefore more comfortable to wear, but also more confusing. Because it does not have a display screen, there’s a learning curve to figuring out what the various vibrations and lights on the Fitbit mean. It’s much clearer on the Pivotal. However, the Fitbit can measure calories in (when you manually add foods to the app), and more clearly displays (on the app) the distance in miles your recorded steps represent. You can also wear it in the shower. With both, you track non-step based exercise manually on the app, and both track your sleep quality in a similar manner. One nice feature of Fitbit that Pivotal is looking to include soon is a desktop dashboard to complement the app. \nSo is the $12 system for you? What it comes down to: 1. how important nutrition tracking is to your fitness goals, 2. whether you want a desktop dashboard to track goals, and 3. how easily you want to sync. If you don’t mind the three seconds it takes to sync the Pivotal (that’s truly all it is) versus the one second for the Fitbit, and you’re fine with a simple black band (colors are coming later in 2015), you can save lots of money by trying out the Pivotal Tracker 1 for just $12. Even if you renew for nearly a decade, you’ll still be at about the cost of one of the other fitness bands…and who knows what technology will be in place by then! \nBuy at the Pivotal Living website for $12 (plus $3 shipping), or find the system on Amazon as well. The app is on both Android and iPhone, and can be set up out of the box in under five minutes.
