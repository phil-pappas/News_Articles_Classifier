This is due to the fact that it is an island in Lake Superior, and the ferries which visit the island are not near major metropolitan areas. It is also the only US national park outside of Alaska which shuts down in the winter. \nIf you take the ferry to the park from Grand Portage, MN (which is the closest ferry port to the island) you will pass the Rock of Ages Lighthouse, which sits on an island no bigger than the lighthouse itself.
