Aboard the line's annual President's Cruise on Crystal Serenity and Chairman's Cruise on Crystal Symphony respectively, Crystal's president and CEO, Edie Rodriguez and Chairman Tan Sri Lim Kok Thay announced today Crystal's plans for the most significant brand expansion in the history of luxury travel and hospitality. Over the next three years, Crystal Cruises will introduce new ships – effectively establishing three brand new classes of cruising – as well as its own Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft. \nIn their special address to guests, Rodriguez and Tan Sri Lim made clear of new parent company, Genting Hong Kong's investment in maintaining Crystal's award-winning reputation and writing a new chapter in the continuing story of Crystal Cruises. The Chairman stated, \"Our intent is to make Crystal Cruises the core of what will become the world's premier luxury hospitality and lifestyle brand portfolio, not only for the immediate future but for years to come.\" \nIn her announcement on Crystal Serenity, Rodriguez shared her enthusiasm about the expansion of Crystal Cruises, saying, \"We continue to think bigger, aiming to create unparalleled luxury experiences and adventures for our loyal and new guests, who – like Crystal – continue to seek broader horizons and new perspectives on the world.\" She added, \"We are ecstatic to continue pioneering new areas of luxury travel. Crystal's newly expanded fleet will truly be travelers' passport to virtually the entire world.\" \nThe stunningly ambitious timeline of new Crystal products begins at the end of 2015. \nCrystal Yacht Cruises – December 23, 2015 \nLate this year, Crystal Esprit will embark on its maiden voyage as the first expansion of the Crystal Cruises fleet. The vessel is an extravagantly appointed yacht, delivered to Crystal Cruises by Genting Hong Kong (GHK), and extensively redesigned to reflect the stylish elegance for which Crystal is renowned. The 62-guest, 3,300-tonnage yacht will offer intimate, exclusive, and immersive experiences with a boutique ambiance. The all-suite yacht will feature posh, high-end finishes and modern technology, and is outfitted with some decidedly extreme features, like a two-passenger submarine, four 10-passenger zodiacs for special excursions and a 12-passenger Wider 32-foot super yacht tender for special boating adventures. Additionally, at their guests' fingertips are water skis, wake boards, kayaks, jet skis, fishing, scuba, and snorkel equipment \nSet for delivery in November 2015, Crystal Esprit marks the debut of the new all-inclusive Crystal Yacht Cruises program, which will sail regional, warm-water itineraries of seven days and offer thrilling experiences on water and ashore. The first voyage sails December 23, 2015, exploring the Seychelles Islands, followed by an inclusive, post-cruise New Year's Eve celebration at the Taj Dubai Hotel. \nFor 2016 and 2017, and early 2018, Crystal Esprit routes for the Seychelles Islands, Dubai and Adriatic Coast include: \n• Seychelles Islands – Mahe, Victoria; St. Anne Island, La Passe, la Digue; Baie Ste. Anne, Praslin; Laraie Bay, Curieuse Island; Anse Saint Jose, Curieuse Island; Cousin Island; Aride; Big Sister Island; and Desroches Island) \n• Dubai - Khasab and Muscat, Oman; Doha, Qatar; Sir Bani Yas Island and Abu Dhabi, UAB) \n• Venice, Italy/Dubrovnik, Croatia - Rovinj, Sibenik, Trogir, Vis, Hvar, and Korcula, Croatia \n• Dubrovnik, Croatia/Venice, Italy - Kotor, Montenegro; Split, Zadar, and Opatija, Croatia; and Piran, Slovenia \n• Dubrovnik, Croatia/ Athens, Greece - Kotor, Montenegro; Corfu, Parga, Itea, Hydra, and Navplion, Greece) \nCrystal River Cruises – 2017 \nThe spring of 2017 brings more growth with Crystal River Cruises. Featuring expertly curated itineraries, Crystal River Cruises will offer the hallmarks of the all-inclusive Crystal experience – six-star service, world-class dining, and enriching shore-side adventures. Spacious suites with exquisitely designed interiors and elegant public rooms will punctuate Crystal's entry into worldwide river cruising. \nCrystal Luxury Air – 2017 \nAlso in 2017, Crystal's brand of Six-Star luxury will soar to new heights with the launch of Crystal Luxury Air, becoming the first in the luxury travel industry to offer extravagant around-the-world trips on the world's most advanced twin-aisle Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The plush aircraft, which typically seats 300, will fly 60 guests in fully reclining business class seats to coveted destinations to which major airlines do not offer nonstop service. Each approximately 28-day itinerary will visit 10-12 remote and/or sought-after locales, with accommodations at some of the world's finest hotels and resorts; cuisine prepared by celebrity chefs inspired by the destination; and world-class cultural entertainment. \nOcean Vessels: \"Crystal Exclusive Class\" – Late 2018 \nCertainly not resting on any laurels, Crystal returns its focus to the seas, with three new \"Crystal Exclusive Class,\" cruise ships with the first expected for delivery in late 2018. Genting Hong Kong has signed a letter of intent with Lloyd Werft in Germany to build the polar ice class vessels. Lloyd Werft is widely recognized in the shipping industry for its excellent reputation and success with world-class new builds, building and lengthening six Norwegian Cruise Line vessels, including the Pride of America, the only ocean cruise ship flying the American Flag, sailing year round in Hawaii. \n\"Our vision and revolutionary plans for Crystal's ocean vessels requires us to partner with a premium shipyard that has the expertise and resources to deliver the 'Crystal Exclusive Class',\" said Tan Sri Lim. \"Lloyd Werft is synonymous with successful world-class new builds and luxury mega yachts, including Luna, the second largest expedition private yacht in the world, measuring at 337 feet long.\" \nWith the introduction of these new vessels, Crystal will be the first-ever cruise line to deliver expedition-capable ships with all the signature features and amenities of a luxury ship or private yacht. \nThe all-suite, all balcony ship will accommodate 1,000 guests, similar to the capacity on Crystal Symphony (922) and Crystal Serenity (1,070), and weigh more than 100,000 gross tons. \n\"With an impressive 100 tons of space per guest, the average space ratio for luxury cruise ships being 60 tons per person, our new ships' guest-to-space rations will be vast in comparison to past, current and under-construction luxury ships, reaching all corners of the world safely, smoothly and in the utmost style and comfort,\" said Rodriguez. \nAdditionally, for the first time ever, guests will have the opportunity to call a Crystal ship \"home,\" with innovative Crystal Residences. Situated on the top deck of the new ships will be 48 unique homes, boasting their own private restaurant, reception and facilities, and much higher ceilings (9 feet) than residences on any other cruise ships or yachts; and equal to most land apartments. Residences will start at 600 square feet and go to more than 4,000 square feet of interior living area, which will be the largest on the high seas. \nOther revolutionary features being introduced on Crystal's new vessels are: a whopping 400 square feet minimum for the guestroom suites - nearly doubling the size on other luxury vessels; increased ceiling heights by one f00t to 8 feet in all suites and decks; raising the bar on personal attention and service with 1,000 crew members on the ships to provide an unheard of one-to-one crew-to-guest ratio; an abundance of mouthwatering options centered on the art and expertise of Michelin-starred and celebrity chefs; and intrepid yacht-like amenities including submarines, helicopters and zodiacs. \nThe plans fulfill Rodriguez's growing vision for the company since taking the helm in 2013, while also solidifying Crystal's unrivaled reputation for innovating new facets of luxury travel. \n\"It has been a personal mission of mine since joining Crystal to see this incredible company reach new potential – and thus, new luxury travelers – as we continue to deliver unparalleled guest experiences and superior standards of excellence.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T00:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T05:21:12.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
