Joint venture partners Grosvenor Britain & Ireland (Grosvenor) and The Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels, Limited are proposing a new landmark at 1-5 Grosvenor Place, Belgravia in the West End of London. Designed by British-based Hopkins Architects, the new building will replace the existing offices at the site, built in the 1960s, with a design that responds to the heritage of its immediate neighbours, providing a new focal point and vibrancy to Hyde Park Corner. \nThe Peninsula London is planned to cater for both hotel guests and local customers. In addition to guestrooms and spa, the hotel will have shops, bars, restaurants and a ballroom. A grand pedestrian entrance on Grosvenor Place will be accessed from a colonnade linking to an internal ‘Palazzo-style’ courtyard, approximately 30 x 30 metres, allowing vehicle access. The proposed building also includes 24-28 residential apartments with a separate leisure and spa facility, reception and entrance on Halkin Street. Plans include improved public realm in Grosvenor Place, Halkin Street and Grosvenor Crescent, with easier road crossings, wider footpaths and new trees planted along Halkin Street and Grosvenor Crescent. The public realm proposals around 1-5 Grosvenor Place are designed by BDP, a major international practice of architects, designers and engineers, which has worked with Grosvenor since 2007. Grosvenor and The Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels, Limited aim to start construction in summer 2017. Peter Vernon, Chief Executive Officer of Grosvenor Britain & Ireland said: “This is an exciting opportunity to shape a very special corner of London. For over 300 years Grosvenor has carefully curated its London estate in Mayfair and Belgravia and The Peninsula London is another important step in our journey. This high-quality development is sensitive to its surroundings, sustainable and will support around 2,800 jobs in the wider economy. It will enhance the West End’s reputation as one of the world’s foremost places to visit and a driving force for the UK economy.” Clement Kwok, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of The Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels, Limited said: “We are delighted to partner with Grosvenor to bring the Peninsula brand to London. As a company with 150 years of history, HSH is genuinely committed to the long term and focuses on developing, as an owner-operator, a small number of the highest quality Peninsula hotels in key international gateway cities. Each of our hotels embraces the local culture, style and history to deliver a unique experience for guests. As one of the world’s most important destinations for business and tourism, London will be an exciting addition to our global network.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T18:43:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
