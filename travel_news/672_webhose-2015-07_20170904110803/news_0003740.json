The first customers, most of them pensioners, stand in a queue to enter a branch at National Bank of Greece headquarters in Athens.

They could still not send money offshore including to make purchases and many visiting their banks believed in the three weeks they were closed, suppliers and workers had grown accustomed to demanding cash-only payments and were unlikely to want to return to electronic money transfers.\n“Nothing has changed, nothing, only instead of using machines to withdraw 60 euros a day we can now take a week’s worth in a day — well that won’t make our lives any better,” said Angelos, 38.\nMost of those going into banks were pensioners. Restrictions ... Greek banks reopen but place many restrictions on transactions, including cash withdrawals.
