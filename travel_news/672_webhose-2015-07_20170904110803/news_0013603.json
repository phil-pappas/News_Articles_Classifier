More Hahn move puts Ecclestone role in doubt \nThe Hong Kong-listed shares in the leading Macau casino operators have fallen over the past year but rebounded after the Macau government on Wednesday reversed limits on mainland transit visitors that were brought in 12 months ago following pressure from Beijing. \n“This is the first sign of policy easing since the downturn began in Macau,” said Anil Daswani, an analyst at Citigroup. “The transit visa policy significantly hit premium mass gross gaming revenue since the second quarter of 2014 and this reversal was much needed to rekindle growth in the volatile Macau market.” \nMacau generated gross gaming revenue of 17.4bn patacas ($2.2bn) in June, down 36 per cent compared to the same period last year but slightly better than analysts’ expectations. \nBy lunchtime in a broadly flat Hong Kong market, shares in Sands China , the local subsidiary of casino tycoon Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands, had surged 15.9 per cent to HK$30.25 but have still lost half of their value over the last year. Shares in Steve Wynn’s Wynn Macau were up 15.6 per cent at HK$14.96 and MGM China had leapt 18.1 per cent to HK$14.98. \nHong Kong markets were closed on Wednesday for a public holiday. \nMacau, the world’s biggest casino market by gaming revenue, continues to face major challenges. \nMore than $20bn of long-planned new casinos are being opened over the next two years, a big expansion in supply at a time when demand remains weak. \nA planned smoking ban, too, could put off punters. Smoking has already been banned on the main casino floors but the Macau government is considering extending this to VIP rooms and removing airport-style smoking lounges. \nMr Daswani said that while preventing high rollers from smoking while they gamble could cut VIP revenues by a further 5-20 per cent, he was hopeful that the smoking lounges would stay, given the government’s about-face on mainland visitor restrictions. \nHowever, Praveen Choudhary, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, argued that it was too soon to call the bottom for the Macau casino market. \n“Many would consider two recent news items as signs of the bottom,” he said. “[The] complete smoking ban could be seen as removal of a long standing overhang and relaxation of transit visas [the] end of tight regulation. We disagree.” \nHe argued that the transit visa adjustment would not change the fundamental pattern of reduced VIP gambling by mainland Chinese and that the smoking ban was likely to be implemented.
