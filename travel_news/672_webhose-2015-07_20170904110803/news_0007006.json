We begin with the ongoing tragi-farce over Greece and the euro , following that referendum where the Greeks were asked to choose between a “Yes” campaign, which held that their country must remain firmly in both the euro and the EU, and a “No” campaign arguing equally firmly that Greece must remain in both the euro and the EU. We go on with that chaos around the Channel Tunnel and across much of Europe over the ever-growing flood of desperate immigrants trying to find safety from Africa and the Middle East. We might continue with the impasse between the EU and Russia over Ukraine; or with the insistence by Germany and Poland that, to keep their economies functioning, they must – regardless of their commitment to the EU that they will reduce “carbon emissions” by 40 per cent within 15 years – continue to burn vast quantities of “CO2-polluting” coal. The answer to what these have in common is that they all reflect the moment when, more obviously than ever before, the dream of a cosily “united Europe” is running into the brick wall of that very thing the “European project” was above all designed to rise above: a narrow sense of national interest. To the man who more than any set the “project” on its way, Jean Monnet, this was always its supreme purpose. He wanted to create a “supranational” government capable of eliminating that destructive evil which he described as “national egoism”. For decades his dream seemed to be inching successfully towards its goal. But what we are seeing today is that the sense of national interest is so ingrained in human nature that it cannot be eliminated. The desperate Greeks, having seen their country crucified on the folly of the euro, fight crazily to survive as a nation without any idea of how this can be done. Many Germans, looking to their own interest, are fed up with having to pour their money into the bottomless pit of Greek debt – while the EU struggles to deal with a crisis it brought on itself, to which there is no sensible solution. Russian-backed separatists firing a mortar towards Ukrainian troops outside the village of Sanzharivka As for that unstoppable flood of immigrants, countries across Europe will do anything to avoid taking responsibility for them, leaving the EU equally impotent. The crisis with Russia was brought on entirely by the EU’s hubristic desire to absorb Ukraine into its own make-believe empire, provoking precisely that nationalistic response from the Russians, including those in Crimea, that the EU no longer understands. For Germans and Poles, faced with a choice between their EU commitment to a fanciful target on reducing “carbon emissions” by nearly half and keeping their lights on by burning coal, it is a no-brainer (we British haven’t yet realised that we face the same choice). So, wherever we look, we see Europe enmiring itself in a maze of unresolvable crises, each of which seems to be reaching an impasse. In the face of all these competing national interests, the EU looks dingier and more powerless by the day, Everywhere the fantasy that “national interest” could somehow be eliminated by a crackpot supra-national form of government is crashing into reality. An offshore windfarm: we are banking on these (Photo: Alamy) But still, like those poor Greeks and most people in Europe, we British also want to cling to that failed dream because, after decades of being caught up in its group think, our leaders have lost the ability to imagine that there could be any alternative. Those victims of an earlier collective dream, the Marxists, used to talk about “the contradictions inherent in late capitalism”, which would one day bring it crashing down. We are now trapped in what might be described as “the contradictions inherent in late-Europeanism”. We are caught between that belief that we must all pool the interests of our countries in some artificial “common interest”, and the reality that, when it comes to the crunch, there is no way to stop that damned “national interest” reappearing. Such is the lesson which every day’s news should now be bringing home to us. But how we might escape from it, not a single politician can yet begin to give us a plausible answer.
