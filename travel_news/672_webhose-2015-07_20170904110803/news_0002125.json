Coldwell said that, based on international examples, between 30 percent and half of the blocks will have winning bids.\n“It seems realistic to me,” David Enríquez, an energy expert at Mexico City’s Goodrich, Riquelme y Asociados law firm, told AFP. “It’s natural that not all fields are awarded in one round.”\nOf the blocks up for bid, four have drawn medium to high interest, while four others have average demand and the rest are less attractive, he said.\nThe sharp drop in global oil prices is also playing a part in investor sentiment. For the auction to be deemed “sufficiently” successful, Mexico would have to award at least the four most attractive blocks, Enríquez said.\n“It’s important because it will be the first test” of the energy reform and a way for companies to get a feel for Mexico’s oil auction system, he said. “It will be like training.”\nBut David Shields, an industry analyst and director of the magazine Energía a Debate, said the government was being “totally pessimistic.”\n“It would be very strange to me if they didn’t award almost all the blocks,” Shields said.\n“There’s always the risk that many of the blocks will be concentrated in the hands of one company. One or two companies could dominate,” he said.\nColdwell said bigger oil firms may sit out the first round and save themselves for the bigger, more complicated projects such as deep-water and inland shale gas drilling.\n“We think that the first round must be evaluated once everything has been developed,” he told reporters last week.\nTelevised auction\nOil auctions are a new thing for Mexico and officials said they wanted to make them transparent. Wednesday’s auction will be shown live on a web and satellite broadcast, said National Hydrocarbon Commission president Juan Carlos Zepeda.\nRepresentatives of each company will place their sealed bids into 14 boxes. A camera will zoom in when envelopes are opened and the winner will be picked on the basis of the highest bid.\n“In terms of transparency, we are above international norms,” Zepeda said.\nThe companies will bid without knowing beforehand the minimum percentage that the government will want to earn for each project.\nAnalysts say the government made an effort to create a transparent system to ease any concerns over the country’s poor track record when it comes to corruption. Last year, Peña Nieto abruptly canceled a contract for a bullet train project that had been awarded to a Chinese-led consortium, angering Beijing.\nHis decision came days before a news report that his wife had bought a mansion from a Mexican firm that was part of the consortium.", "external_links": ["http://www.pemex.com/Paginas/default.aspx", "http://ronda1.gob.mx/English/ongoingbid.html"], "published": "2015-07-14T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T15:32:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
