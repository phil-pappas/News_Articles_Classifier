Minister used the occasion to express her ministry’s gratitude to the ministries of Local Government and Rural Development and Chieftaincy and Traditional Affairs, the Greater Accra Regional House of Chiefs, RCC, AMA and other stakeholders for supporting the ministry to celebrate the festival. \nThe Chief Executive of the Accra Metropolitan Assembly, Alfred Oko Vanderpuye commended the leadership roles of the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Creative Arts (MOTCCA) which made last year’s Homofest a success. He expressed optimism that this year’s festival will surpass the previous year. He also encouraged all to work hard after the launch to ensure a successful Homofest come August 10. \nDelivering his speech, Nii Lantey Vanderpuye, the Deputy Minister for Local Government and Rural Development bemoaned the gradual extinction of the Ga-Dangbe culture in the Greater Accra Metropolis. He therefore said the festival must be celebrated for the young ones to appreciate and grow with the Ga-Dangbe culture. \nActivities outlined for the 2015 edition of Homofest include clean-up exercises, photo exhibitions, food bazaars, lectures on the history of the Ga-Dangbes and a durbar of chiefs to climax the event. All these are aimed at projecting the norms, food, dance, customs, traditions and folklore of the people of Ga-Dangbe. \nThe event was chaired by the president of the Greater Accra Regional House of Chiefs, Nene Abrah kabu Akuoku III. Also present at the launch were Queen Mothers and other important royals in the Greater Accra Region and stakeholders in the tourism, culture and creative arts sector.
