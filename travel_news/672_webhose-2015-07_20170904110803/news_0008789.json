On a global scale, adventure travel is still for the privileged, because the whole booking process, pricing models and additional fees make up an end price that is not affordable to the average consumer. (Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150728/247176 ) Kalle Viira , the CMO and Co-founder of Faralong.com explains: \"You wouldn't expect to pay a fixed amount when sharing a cab with several people. When you share it with four people, the ride is not four times more expensive. Instead, it is cheaper when more people take the ride with you. So why not expect a similar pricing principle when booking an adventure holiday in South America , an African safari or an Everest base camp trek?\"You can, however, expect it now. Faralong.com has developed a unique pricing model for adventure tours. Prices go down as more people join, and there are no pricing differences between open and private groups. So you can choose to go with a group of your close friends or family or join an open group to make new friends - and the pricing model will be the same. Private tours do not therefore cost more than regular group tours. \"We just launched a new travel booking platform that is changing the way adventure tours will be booked in the future. The technology connects travellers more directly to travel services worldwide and local tour operators on-site. Not only does the platform cut out the middleman and extra costs, but it is sleek and extremely easy to use,\" says Viira. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T11:29:51.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
