The new partnerships give Stash members traveling to the Big Apple more opportunities to earn and redeem points at some of the city’s most culturally-rich, independent properties. \n“Because New York City continues to be one of the most popular destinations in the world, we want to ensure that travelers who value authentic experiences can stay at one-of-a-kind hotels in the heart of the city – without giving up a chance to earn valuable rewards points,” said Jeff Low, Founder and CEO of Stash Hotel Rewards. “Whether people come to check New York City’s many amazing sights off of their bucket list, or they’re in town frequently for business, these hotels offer a true cultural experience – in addition to now helping their guests earn free stays at independent hotels throughout the country.” \nThe three new Stash partner hotels in New York City offer travelers the opportunity to enjoy a true metropolitan experience, while also providing welcoming at-home accommodations. \nThe Park South Hotel is a warm, newly renovated boutique property in Manhattan’s dynamic Park Avenue South neighborhood that allows guests to feel as if they are staying in a private Manhattan townhouse. Its redesigned Art Deco-inspired rooms merge stylish elegance with cutting-edge entertainment and technology. The hotel features, o ya , a contemporary Japanese restaurant by James Beard Award Winning Chef, Tim Cushman, and a famous rooftop lounge that offers guests an escape from the hustle of the city, while allowing them to enjoy a cocktail and a view of the Chrysler Building. \nTravelers seeking upscale accommodations and impeccable service can stay at one of Brooklyn’s finest properties, the Condor Hotel . The Condor provides a refined environment with contemporary décor and amenities not typically found in the city – including a fully equipped modern kitchenette and a balcony off of every room. Guests can also use the hotel’s back garden patio as a place of tranquility, step out into Brooklyn’s famous food scene, or visit other nearby attractions, like Coney Island or the Barclays Center. \nTravelers looking to experience the easy-going spirit of New Orleans amidst the thrill of the city that never sleeps may earn Stash points at The French Quarters Guest Apartments . Guests of this unique hotel enjoy exposed brick walls, Jazz-era posters and paintings, black-and-white tile bathrooms, and friendly service. The New Orleans style property offers the welcome of a bed and breakfast, along with midtown convenience and four-star rooms. Times Square, the Theater District, the Intrepid Air and Space Museum, Central Park, and many other must-see sights are just steps away. \n“In a highly-competitive market, it was important that we offer our guests a loyalty program that will add even more incentive for new and repeat business,” said Colin McCormack, the General Manager for The French Quarters Guest Apartments. “We also really like the other independent hotels that have partnered with Stash, and we recognize that there are travelers with a propensity to visit independent properties that we can now connect with through the program.” \nTravelers can join Stash for free at www.stashrewards.com . Stash members earn five points for each dollar spent on eligible room rates and can redeem them at more than 160 one-of-a-kind independent hotels across the U.S. and the Caribbean. Stash points never expire, and redemption is simple, without blackout dates or category restrictions found in many chain programs. Stash partner hotels also provide members with exclusive travel deals .
