The CBD property is currently undergoing a AUD$200 million redevelopment and team recruitment is underway in the lead up to its May 2016 launch date. \nAs Director of Catering and Conventions, Marjolein will be responsible for the management of all conventions, meetings and events taking place across the property, from initial contact to completion, ensuring superior management and services, and client satisfaction. Four Points by Sheraton Sydney, Darling Harbour’s new convention facilities will include 4,800 sqm of new conference, meeting and event space, comprising a total of 23 rooms available for both large and intimate occasions. Moving forwards, Marjolein will also oversee the implementation of the hotel’s new event strategy, ensuring that the hotel’s world class facilities and services are managed efficiently and to the highest standard. “I’m really exciting to be joining the team at Four Points by Sheraton Sydney. The redevelopment is going to be an amazing addition to the conference and event space in the heart of Sydney and planning is already underway to ensure the opening in May 2016 is a huge success,” Marjolein said. Marjolein has over 23 years of experience working in conference and event sales and event management for large-scale luxury hotels. Marjolein started her career in Europe, where she spent four years at the Hilton London Metropole as the Director of In-House Sales before moving to Australia. Based in Sydney, Marjolein spent nine years at the Hilton Sydney where she was Director of Event Services, before taking the position of Director of Catering Sales and Conference Services at Four Seasons Hotel Sydney. In her new role, Marjolein will report into David Fraser, General Manager of Four Points by Sheraton Sydney, Darling Harbour. “With less than 12 months to go until the development is complete, recruitment is beginning to ramp up. This is one of many appointments we’ll be looking to make over the coming months,” David said. “The role of Director of Catering and Conventions in particular though, will be instrumental to the success of the new look hotel. With the additional convention and meeting facilities to manage and oversee, we needed someone who was hungry to take an already successful catering team to new heights. Marjolein’s passion and past experience makes her the perfect fit for this role.” As well as the additional 4,800sqm of convention, exhibition and meeting space, the new look hotel will include an additional third tower, adding 222 new stylish guestrooms to its current portfolio, bringing the total number of rooms to 905. Scheduled for completion by May 2016 for the convention space and August 2016 for the third tower, the updated hotel will include two pillar-less ballrooms, the largest with seating up to 1,100 theatre-style, breakout and meeting rooms, dedicated pre-function space and state-of-the-art audio visual technology. Bar Eleven, Four Points by Sheraton Sydney’s open rooftop bar, with breathtaking views over the harbour, will continue to operate and provide guests with an alternative outdoor venue for special occasions, meetings and events. Ideally located on Sussex Street overlooking the vibrant Darling Harbour precinct, Four Points by Sheraton, Sydney, Darling Harbour, is Australia’s largest hotel offering a current total of 648 rooms, including 17 suites, along with simple comforts and exceptional experiences at a great price in the heart of Sydney.
