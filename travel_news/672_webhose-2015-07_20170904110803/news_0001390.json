We’ve been doing quite a lot of research.” \nShe added to achieve the sales growth she is looking for, she is hoping to work with even more agents who currently account for about 60% of the operator’s total sales. \nSalame said: “We believe we can grow the agency relationships within the UK, Europe and South Africa.” \nShe added to ensure the operator was working with more agents, she was looking to recruit between two and four additional business development managers to join the six-strong team currently in place. \n“It’s really exciting,” she said. “There’s room to aggressively grow the brand within the UK market.” \nSalame added Topdeck was also planning a social media campaign to highlight the fun to be had on a coach holiday. \nShe said: “Collectively we will carve out an unparalleled offering that will tackle the perception of coach travel and provide young travel fans with inspirational trips. \n“Topdeck’s offering already speaks to young travellers seeking adventure - our mission is to further inspire growth and widespread Topdeck brand awareness in Europe by making the brand not only relevant, but exciting across every single touchpoint. \n“I think there is incredible opportunities to drive relevance, while exciting and engaging our fans via integrated campaigns. \n“The Topdeck story is visual and about making travel dreams come true; social media is pivotal in positioning our tailored products to a young, savvy and always-on audience.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T11:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T15:45:44.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
