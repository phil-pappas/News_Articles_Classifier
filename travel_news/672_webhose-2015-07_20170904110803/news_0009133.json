Is that you? \nBreaking Bad fans, we hope you're sitting down for what we're about to tell you, because this could be the best news you receive this year. \nA Breaking Bad-themed cafe has opened in Istanbul called Walter's Coffee Roastery , and the owners have pulled out all the stops. \nFrom staff dressed in hazmat suit uniforms, coffee served in beakers, to candy which resembles the show's famous \"Blue Sky\" crystal methamphetamine, the cafe is a paradise for fans of the award-winning AMC show. A photo posted by Walter's Coffee Roastery (@walterscoffee) on Jul 17, 2015 at 1:45am PDT \nThe crime drama from X-Files writer Vince Gilligan starred Bryan Cranston as Walter White, a brilliant but struggling high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and decides to produce crystal methamphetamine to secure his family's financial future. \nWalter White (Brian Cranston) and Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) in a scene from Breaking Bad \nBreaking Bad ended in 2013 after five seasons and was one of the highest-rated television shows of all time. It inspired the award-winning prequel Better Call Saul. \nLocated in downtown Istanbul, Walter's Coffee Roastery is the creation of Deniz Kosan who wanted to pay homage to his favourite show by creating a cafe with a science laboratory atmosphere. \nThe walls are decorated with periodic tables, the pancakes adorned with Walter White's face and the cupcakes topped with White's famous blue meth. \nCoffee is served in beakers Photo: Instagram \nOf course the breakfast menu is also inspired by White's pancake and bacon-loving son, Walt Jr. \nThe cafe only opened in May after a kickstarter campaign, but already boasts 13,000 Facebook likes and 9,000 followers on Instagram . \nSpeaking to Buzzfeed, Kosan said the idea for Walter's Coffee Roastery had originally been a joke between him and his cousin. The first name for the cafe was Heisenberg Coffee and Roasting, inspired by White's druglord alias. \nThe cafe is meant to resemble a science laboratory. Kosan has plans to expand to Europe and the US. Photo: Instagram The German-born photographer said he had planned to open the cafe in Brooklyn, but when an investor backed-out, he relocated to Turkey. We bet they're regretting that decision now. \nKosan already has plans to expand the business in Turkey later this year and next year, the United States and Europe. - Sydney Morning Herald", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T02:27:56.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
