Over the past few weeks, Waitrose, the Telegraph and chef Heston Blumenthal have demonstrated how clever ingredients can make show-stopping summer dishes and drinks. With his flair and originality, the Michelin-starred chef has created recipes using tasty products in the Heston from Waitrose range. He’s a man with a lot on his plate, but here he takes time out of his busy schedule to reminisce about some of his formative food experiences, to reveal how his favourite flavours of summer influence the Heston from Waitrose range, and how he hopes his exclusive Waitrose recipes will excite and inspire the nation. For 20 years he has enthralled thousands at his famous restaurant, The Fat Duck in Berkshire, one of just four in the UK to have earned the full complement of Michelin stars. But it is via television that he has engaged with millions the world over. During the series Heston’s Feasts , viewers watched him turn eating into a multi-sensory experience. Surprisingly straightforward It is well known that Heston combines art with science when creating and testing his ground-breaking recipes. Less well known is that after a long association with Reading University’s School of Food Biosciences he was awarded an honorary doctorate in 2006. He may be the “professor of haute cuisine”, but at home his tastes are, by his own admission, surprisingly straightforward. My earliest memories of summer are things like the smell of a newly mown lawn, strawberries and cream and, of course, barbecues “The simple things are so often the best,” he says. “In summer, I just love barbecued burgers, and I think I have something of a fetish for pork pies.” This is good news, especially to anyone daunted by the thought of attempting his recipes. Are they suitable for novices, I wonder, and if so, where is a good place to start? “At this time of year, I suggest the barbecue,” he replies. “With a recipe like my barbecued pork shoulder you can really show off your cooking skills with a minimum of fuss. I’m due to feature this recipe in the Telegraph next week.” Childhood memories Summertime, holidays and childhood memories have played a significant part in Heston’s culinary creations over the years and this is a theme clearly reflected in his Heston from Waitrose range of products. “My earliest memories of summer are things like the smell of a newly mown lawn, strawberries and cream and, of course, barbecues,” he says. “So it’s no coincidence that fresh herbs, berry fruits and chargrilled flavours all feature in my summer range and recipes at Waitrose.” A great partnership It’s not only cooks Heston wants to engage with – it’s “mixologists”, too. After its launch last year, the Heston from Waitrose Fruit Cup became an instant success in the Waitrose spirits range. Was he at all surprised by this? “Delighted but not really surprised,” he says. “For me, it’s the product I most closely associate with an English summer’s day.” It is a fabulous concoction and the main ingredient in Heston’s Fruit Cup cocktail recipe, where it’s mixed with fresh raspberries, ginger, rosemary and lots of ice and ginger ale. The fruit cup also adds a lovely fruitiness to other recipes such as Heston’s rhubarb sponge . Heston has four high-profile restaurants to run and international commitments throughout the year, so how does he manage to devote time to his Heston from Waitrose range and ensure that his exacting standards of quality are maintained? “It’s a great collaboration we have with Waitrose,” he says. “They are as keen on perfection as I am. And, of course, I’m supported by my amazing development team, too, headed by Otto Romer.” It goes without saying that quality control is a serious business for both Heston and Waitrose. “Once we have an idea, we spend months developing it and scrutinising the production process until everything is spot-on. I wouldn’t have it any other way.” Yet even then the job is not done. Every week, without fail, Heston dispatches a staff member to the supermarkets to buy a selection of Heston from Waitrose products. Back in the kitchen, the items are subjected to rigorous taste-testing to ensure everything lives up to their expectations. Sweet treats Outside, the sun beats down in a way that is hardly characteristic of the average British summer. My thoughts turn to ice cream, a subject I know is close to Heston’s heart, too. I ask him how he got the idea for his Heston from Waitrose Salted Caramel Popcorn Ice Cream. It turns out that, during his school holidays in the Seventies, he was a regular movie-goer in West London, nurturing a penchant for popcorn, both salted and sweet. “Saltiness and sweetness are the Romeo and Juliet of flavour pairings,” he says. “All I did with this ice cream was bring together two of my all-time favourite childhood foods. I knew instinctively it would work.” The mind of a great chef, at least a chef like Heston Blumenthal, never rests. So it was only natural that he went on to create a dessert recipe to showcase his popular ice cream. His grilled pineapple and ice cream sundae is truly sensual. It looks amazing and entertains with its contrast between warm pineapple and cold ice cream; between its sweet, salty and citrus flavours and creamy, crunchy textures. What can be more enjoyable than cooking and sharing a delicious dish like my grilled pineapple and ice cream sundae? With its origins in Heston’s early cinema experiences, you might say this sundae is the sweet-toothed foodie’s equivalent of a widescreen blockbuster. And no doubt to the delight of home barbecue heroes up and down the country, it’s very easy to prepare. Heston chose pineapple for this recipe because, ever since it was brought to Britain from the Americas centuries ago, it has been a symbol of welcome and hospitality. When Heston opened Dinner in London in 2011, food historian Ivan Day suggested pineapples feature on the menu, which is how spit-roasted pineapple and tipsy cake became one of Dinner’s signature desserts. “The flavour of caramelized pineapple is sublime and it’s something anyone can recreate on a barbecue at home. And when you place the cooked chunks of pineapple back on the fresh pineapple skin, this dessert becomes visually very pleasing too.” Heston is keen to stress that making eye-catching seasonal dishes with amazing flavours is something within reach of us all. While he acknowledges that some of his recipes for Waitrose involve several steps and a degree of precision, they are not technically difficult. Success comes by closely following the method described. In a bid to encourage home cooks to experiment beyond their usual repertoire, Heston has made sure that a number of his Waitrose recipes are, in fact, quite simple and quick to prepare. “I would strongly encourage everyone to try my grilled pineapple and ice cream sundae next time they fire up the barbecue. It’s not complicated, and all members of the family can pitch in. What can be more enjoyable than cooking and sharing a delicious dish like this?” Serving Heston’s pineapple and ice cream sundae will win you the admiration of family and friends. You might even create some summer memories of your own that you will cherish for years to come.
