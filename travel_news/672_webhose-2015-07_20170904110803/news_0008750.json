According to an Us Weekly report, Kardashian has consulted high-power Hollywood divorce attorney Laura Wasser to seek sole custody of their three kids: Mason, 5, Penelope, 3, and Reign, 7 months.\nKardashian, 36, reportedly wants the children the majority of the time, but Disick, 32, is likely to get continual payouts from her since she is the higher earner, a family law attorney tells Page Six.\n“Children have the right to live in the lifestyle of both parents regardless of where they are,” explained Goldie Schon, a California-based family law attorney.\n“While Scott may only have the kids 10 per cent of the time, because [Kourtney] is such a high-income earner it’s very likely she would pay him child support. If Scott wants it and pushes it he will likely get child support from her,” said Schon. Scott Disick and Kourtney Kardashian attending the E! Upfront 2013 Event in New York..

She likely has her own skeletons that Scott can use as a way of negotiating,” opined Schon.\nRequest for comment from Kardashian and attorney Laura Wasser was not immediately returned.\nThis story originally appeared in The New York Post.\nKourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick Picture: Instagram Source: Supplied\nCountdown to the split\nOriginally published as Kourtney will likely pay Scott child support", "external_links": ["http://pagesix.com/2015/07/23/kourtney-will-likely-pay-scott-child-support/?_ga=1.194677995.714183804.1372808428", "http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/kourtney-kardashian-will-likely-pay-scott-disick-child-support/story-fnk825aa-1227454871819", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/24/1227454/871283-7433434c-317e-11e5-9ab0-19db9af17447.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/24/1227455/009714-ae15cd1e-3192-11e5-9ab0-19db9af17447.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/24/1227455/520992-eec66bc8-31bc-11e5-9ab0-19db9af17447.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/24/1227455/010145-ad514052-3192-11e5-9ab0-19db9af17447.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:12:49.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
