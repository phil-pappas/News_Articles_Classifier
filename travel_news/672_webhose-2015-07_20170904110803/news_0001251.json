The airline earned USD$1.19 billion for the second quarter ended June 30, up from USD$789 million in the prior year period.\nTotal operating costs, including a charge, fell 10 percent to USD$8.47 billion. Fuel expense fell 32 percent to USD$2.11 billion.\nThe Chicago-based airline said it expects passenger unit revenue to decrease between 5 and 7 percent in the third quarter. Capacity will only grow between 1 and 1.5 percent in 2015 compared to a year earlier, it said, lowering a prior forecast for growth of 2 percent.\nThe airline said it expects a pre-tax profit margin between 13.5 percent and 15.5 percent in the third quarter, excluding special items.\nUnited plans to buy back USD$3 billion of its stock.\n\"The USD$3 billion share repurchase... demonstrates the confidence we have in our future,\" chief executive Jeff Smisek said in a news release.\nCHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT\nDespite the profit rise, United's outlook reflects the challenging revenue environment that US airlines continue to face as the dollar lowers visitors' spending power in the United States.\nThere has also been an increase in capacity on some domestic flights, contributing to United's 3.4 percent unit revenue drop in the second quarter.\nDelta said last week that it expects passenger revenue per available seat mile to decline between 4.5 and 6.5 percent in the third quarter.\nPublicity about slowing capacity growth to match demand has raised eyes at the US Department of Justice. The regulator is investigating whether carriers have worked together illegally to keep air fares high.\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T18:15:10.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
