The bank's latest launch is an 18-month bond paying 2.15pc, which can be opened online with a minimum of £1,000. Charter has also increased the rate on its 120-day notice account paying 1.95pc (up from 1.9pc), making it the market leader. • More details: Charter Savings Bank fixed-rate bonds Funds held in the bond cannot be accessed until maturity and withdrawals from the notice account can only be made after giving the required notice, you cannot access the funds early by paying a penalty. VERDICT Charter Savings Bank, one of the most proactive of the \"challenger\" banks since its launch earlier this year, has further established its dominance in the savings market by launching a best buy fixed-rate bond, and by improving the rate on its notice account, pushing both to the top of the tables. Just last week Charter improved the rates on five fixed-rate bonds, making all but one the market leading account for its term. The bank's one-year bond pays 2.06pc (up from 2pc), the two-year bond pays 2.25pc (up from 2.16pc), the three-year bond pays 2.65pc (up from 2.25pc), the four-year bond pays 2.75pc (up from 2.35pc) and the five-year bond pays 3.05pc (up from 2.5pc). The newest account, the 18-month fixed-rate bond paying 2.15pc, is the highest-paying account for its term, beating the previous best from United Trust Bank (which paid 2.05pc). On £15,000, the bond would accrue interest of £490 , before tax, over 18 months. The provider, not content with having the joint-highest notice account rate on the market (Secure Trust Bank also pays 1.9pc), now pays 1.95pc, in an attempt to be the clear market leader in this category. Putting £15,000 into the notice account would earn interest of £290 , before tax, over one year. • Where to find the best cash 'Super Isa' rates • Interest rates predictions: markets suggest May 2016 for first rise Follow @telegraph High Interest Paying Current Accounts Bank Account Name Offer More details Nationwide FlexDirect 5% on balances up to £2,500 Apply Santander 123 Account 3% on balances from £3000 Apply Clydesdale Bank Current Account Direct 2% in credit interest Apply", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T02:26:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
