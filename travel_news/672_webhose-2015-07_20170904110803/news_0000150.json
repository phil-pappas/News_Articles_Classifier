Gradually the Lululemon-leggings-and-sports-bras crowd — including one jogging with a selfie stick — gave way to bubbies in turbans, commuters on shared Citi Bikes and runners even slower than me.\nMy self-esteem, which plummets with every glimpse of a tire-free torso, suddenly spiked. I found my Miami.\nMiami, with its models, curvy-in-all-the-right-places beauties and high-heel affliction, has always made me, a normal size 8, feel fat. And a little out of place in a place so obsessed with surfaces.\nBut lately, there’s a new Miami trending, sophisticated where the old one was shallow, and north, where the original was South. Its name is Mid-Beach, and it’s the sleek maillot to SoBe’s bandage bikinis.\nMid-Beach originally boomed as postwar prosperity ushered in an age of lavish resorts in the 1950s and ’60s, led by the 1954-vintage Fontainebleau Miami Beach and its neighborhood Eden Roc, opened in 1956. While South Beach is more famous for its art deco preservation, more than 100 buildings north of 24th Street on waterfront Collins Avenue are part of an architectural district noted for its midcentury-modern buildings.\nThe area later went bust with immigration and crime waves, leaving distinctive but increasingly decrepit resorts to languish. The revival of South Beach in the ’80s and ’90s gradually crept north. In its rebirth, Mid-Beach is in its neo-prime, sprouting new resorts in historic properties that have more real estate than most South Beach forebears.\n“We’ve seen a shift north in where development is going,” said Jorian Weiner of the new Thompson Miami Beach hotel. The Thompson opened late last year, merging neighboring art deco and International Style towers into one hip hotel with 380 rooms, a generous pool deck and a restaurant from Miami celebrity chef Michelle Bernstein. “This neighborhood is less congested, and South Beach is a quick Uber ride away.”\nMid-Beach doesn’t have cheek-by-jowl restaurants and shops lining its streets. In fact, other than Collins Avenue, the main drag, it’s fairly residential. But new hotels have introduced bars and restaurants that draw locals, particularly unique bars like 1930s House, a vintage Mediterranean-style bungalow whitewashed on the exterior and revamped into a breezy bar with mismatched barware and creative cocktails.\nAcross the street, the Tavern in the Hotel Croydon, opened last July, serves reasonably priced meals, and a chalkboard menu touts whole snapper and local draft beers. “There was nothing here 10 years ago, nowhere to eat,” said Nathan Lieberman, owner of the Croydon, over eggs Benedict. “Now it’s like urban sprawl north from South Beach.”\nEarly bettors say the neighborhood has cachet without attitude. “I work with emerging designers, so naturally, I wanted to open in an emerging area of the Magic City,” said Andria Mitsakos, who recently opened her first shop, a small space crammed with designer swimsuits, cover-ups, jewelry and accessories, called Wanderlista Miami in the Croydon.\nUnlike space-pinched South Beach hotels, the new Mid-Beach entries aim to keep guests on the property with lavish amenities.\nMiami Beach Edition, a venture between legendary hotelier Ian Schrager and Marriott International, functions like a beached cruise ship — albeit much more high-styled, in shades of blinding white and blingy gold. In addition to two pools, the hotel hosts a nightclub, an ice skating rink and a four-lane bowling alley (serving white Russians, known as “the Dude” for fans of The Big Lebowski ). Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten created menus, including that of the high-style Matador Room, a circular dining room that deserves to be on any midcentury design tour.\nObservers expect Mid-Beach to fully explode next fall with the opening of the Faena District, a $1 billion hotel/condo/retail area with an arts center designed by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, residences from Britain’s Norman Foster and a hotel designed by Aussie filmmaker Baz Luhrmann ( The Great Gatsby ).\nBy then Nobu Hotels, from actor Robert De Niro and chef Nobu Matsuhisa, will convert the existing Eden Roc with a designer makeover by David Rockwell.\nI spent my last ego-salvaging evening in Mid-Beach at WunderBar, a tiny lobby bar at Circa 39 hotel where management has retooled the cocktail program to include sugar cane juice you squeeze yourself alongside a shot of rum for DIY mixology. A group, including one of the slow joggers I’d seen earlier in the day, plopped down on the couch next to us.\n“Miami just makes you feel good,” she said, of her decision to buy a condo in Mid-Beach. And for the first time, I had to agree with that.\nElaine Glusac is a freelance writer in Chicago.\nWhen you go Rooms at the Thompson Miami Beach start at $349. thompsonhotels.com .\nRooms at Hotel Croydon start at $169. hotelcroydonmiami.com .\nMore lavish rooms at the Miami Beach Edition start at $459. editionhotels.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T03:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T22:49:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
