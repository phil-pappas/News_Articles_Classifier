Cantwell Seattle Times outdoors editor \nHiking among Washington’s mountains, forests and streams is a big benefit of living here. Want to do some payback? Be a trail-work volunteer. Breathe mountain air, meet new friends, and learn to tell a Pulaski from a McLeod (they’re trail tools). \nHere’s a sampling of work parties led by the nonprofit Washington Trails Association this coming week: \n* Independence Lake-North Lake Trail (Darrington Ranger District) In the Verlot area off the Mountain Loop Highway. The trail begins as an easy hike to Independence Lake and then ascends steeply up and over a ridge to remote North Lake. Crew will repair winter damage and improve general condition of the trail. Click to sign up for Thursday, July 16 , or Friday, July 17. \n* Meadow Creek Trail (Skykomish Ranger District) A popular Stevens Pass-Area trail that climbs the first mile through a 1960s burn and salvage clearcut then enters the virgin forest of Henry M. Jackson Wilderness. Crew will focus on maintenance and brush control for first 2 miles of trail. Click to sign up for Friday, July 17 or Saturday, July 18. Most Read Stories \nIcicle Creek Canyon trails (Wenatchee River Ranger District) Icicle Creek Canyon outside of Leavenworth provides access to some of the best backcountry in the state.

Click to sign up for Friday, July 17 ; Saturday, July 18 ; or Sunday, July 19 . \nWhite River-area trails, Mount Rainier National Park Help restore the trail leading from White River Campground near the park’s White River Entrance.

Volunteers remove downed logs after spring snowmelt, cut away brush, retread worn stretches of trail, and build turnpikes, bridges and drainage structures. No prior experience is necessary, just a desire to work with other outdoors enthusiasts, to have fun playing in the dirt and to contribute to something that benefits all. Tools, hard hats and training provided. You bring lunch, water and work gloves, and work at your own pace.
