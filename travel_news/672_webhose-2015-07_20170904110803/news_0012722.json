FILDA will be a good platform to promote South African manufactured products in the Angolan market and beyond,” said Masina.\nRelated Posts South African Airways (SAA) has embarked upon a sustainable aviation fuel program South Africa’s new tourism campaign covers significant Indian cities Siemens to realign regional organization and strengthen corporate units South Africa to invest 50 million US dollars for tourism promotion", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T01:20:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
