The billionaire published four comic drawings inspired by self-portraits on Sina Weibo, China’s Twitter-like variant, on Sunday morning, saying it takes more to be a painter than to run a business. As he developed Alibaba from start-up into an internet conglomerate listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Ma’s status as a successful entrepreneur is evident. Taking his business accomplishments into account, maybe it can be as hard to be an equally capable artist as it is to be a successful businessperson. Now that the business leader finds every little bit about his life under national scrutiny – a by-product of frequenting China’s Rich List and of Alibaba’s sensational initial public offering last September – it came as no surprise that the post attracted more than 43,000 “likes” and nearly 8,000 comments in 24 hours. The post attracted more than 43,000 “likes” and nearly 8,000 comments in 24 hours Apart from the aesthetic perspective, some viewers said it’s the blogger’s whimsical captions that prompted more laughter, offering a glimpse of the businessman’s verbal skills. “This painting from Pablo Picasso’s early age caught my eye on my first visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

The other three images followed a timeline from a childlike Jack to a boldly dressed, white-haired young Jack and ended with a cigarette-smoking senior. The caption on the second image, with Jack sporting a pop star vibe, reads “be your true self”, indicating a blatant, out-there attitude. Now the tone is less farcical and more philosophical.
