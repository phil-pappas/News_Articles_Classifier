Here are some tips from AAA: • Check your vehicle’s payload capacity, that is, the maximum combined weight of all cargo and passengers that can safely be carried. You can typically find this figure on a sticker attached to the driver’s door of the vehicle. • Limit any load on top of your vehicle to a maximum of 18” in height and no more than 100 pounds. • Do not overload the trunk or rear cargo compartment. Items in a vehicle’s open cargo area or on the roof should be properly secured to prevent shifting of the load.
