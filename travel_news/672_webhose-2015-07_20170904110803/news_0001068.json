Hamiel has been CEO of MAC since 1985 and makes $196,750. His position has a waiver from the usual state salary cap, which allows him to make more than state agency commissioners — who recently received raises from Gov. Mark Dayton , to as much as $155,000 — but $200,095 is the current maximum. As the airport prepares for Hamiel's eventual retirement — nothing is imminent, but he's worked there for 38 years — officials say the position's salary needs to be raised even higher to keep up with other airport executives. The commission studied the pay of the top executives at 27 large metro airports in the United States and found that Hamiel ranks dead last. The median salary was $277,643 and the highest was the Dallas-Fort Worth CEO's $453,200 per year. \"At some point, (Hamiel) will retire, and there is concern that when he does, the MAC’s non-competitive CEO salary structure could make it difficult to attract highly qualified external candidates with extensive airport experience,\" said airport spokesman Patrick Hogan . The MAC is set to vote on the pay bump on Monday. Hamiel was unavailable for comment. \nWant Minneapolis / St. Paul Travel news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
