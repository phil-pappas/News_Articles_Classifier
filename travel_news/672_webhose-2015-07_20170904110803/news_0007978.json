Thomas A. Dickerson | Jul 23, 2015 Hon. Thomas A. Dickerson Adv: \nIn the never-ending story: Uber lawsuits update, eturboews.com (4/16/2015) we examined the recent decision, O’Connor v. Uber Technologies, Inc., 2015 WL 1069092 (N.D. Cal. 2015) wherein the Court noted that “Plaintiffs claim that they are employees of Uber, as opposed to its independent contractors, and thus are eligible for various statutory protections for employees codified in the California Labor Code...the Court first concludes that Plaintiffs are Uber’s presumptive employees, because they ‘perform services’ for the benefit of Uber. The Court next holds that whether an individual should ultimately be classified as an employee or an independent contractor under California law presents a mixed question of law and fact that must typically be resolved by a jury”. In this week’s article we examine the recent decision of the California Labor Commissioner finding that a former Uber driver was an employee, not an independent contractor. \nTravel Law Update \nThe American Tourist Invasion Begins \nIn Carnival Corporation Granted U.S. Approval for Travel to Cuba, www.eturbonews (7/7/2015) it was noted that “Carnival Corporation...today announced that the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the U.S. Department of Commerce granted approval for the company to begin travel to Cuba...beginning in May 2016\". But in Goode, Cuba’s Environmental Concerns Grow With Prospect of U.S. Presence, nytimes.com (7/1/2015) it was noted that “Dr. Angulo, a senior marine scientist at the University of Havana, is...worried about the effects that a flood of American tourists and American dollars might have on this country’s pristine coral reefs, mangrove forests, national parks and organic farms-environmental assets that are a source of pride here”. \nBritain Under New Terrorist Threat \nIn Erlanger, 10 Years After London Bombings, Warnings of a Greater Threat, nytimes.com (7/7/2015) it was noted that “As Britain mourned the 52 civilians killed 10 years ago in its most devastating terrorist attacks, government officials warned on Tuesday that the threat of terrorism had only increased, though its nature has shifted. Four suicide bombers linked to Al Queda detonated explosives on a London bus and on three subway trains in the attacks on July 7, 2005. About 700 people were wounded...Less than two weeks ago, 38 people, including 30 Britons were killed when a young Tunisian, who was reported to have trained in Libya and to have claimed allegiance to the Islamic State, opened fire at a beach resort in Sousse, Tunisia. It was the deadliest act of terrorism against Britons sine the attacks in 2005\". In King & Hassan, State of Emergency declared in Tunisia, latimes.com (7/5/2015) it was noted that “the June 26 attack on the idyllic seaside town of Sousse, which killed at least 38 people, most of them British vacationers, coupled with Islamist militants’ assault in March on a landmark museum in the capital, seemingly forced the government’s hand”. And in Gall and Samti, Tunisian Gunman Showed Subtle Signs of Redicalization, nytimes.com (6/28/2015) it was noted that “The Tunisian student who shot 39 tourists at a seaside hotel on Friday was a silent loner who showed signs of radicalism in the past year” and Arrested. 12 tourist killers in Tunisia, eturbonews.com &7/2/2015). \nHotel Gym Safety \nIn Daugherty, Safety Tips for Using Hotel Gym Equipment, nytimes.com (7/1/2015) it was noted that “The death of Dave Goldberg, the chief executive of SurveyMonkey, in May at a resort gym in Mexico raised some unsettling questions for travelers who like to work out when they’re on the road: How safe are hotel fitness facilities and their equipment?...Experts say the likelihood of dying, being badly injured or contracting a serious disease as a result of a visit to a hotel gym is rare, but the potential is real. The risks include equipment-related injuries, heart attacks and a constellation of contagions, for which gyms are ideal breeding grounds”. \nWater Park Disaster In Taiwan \nIn Forsythe, Taiwan Water Park Blast Leaves Hundreds Injured, nytimes.com (6/27/2015) it was noted that “Hundreds of people were injured at a water park in Taiwan...when a cloud of colored powder ignited in the air over a crowd during an event, erupting into a huge fireball. No deaths were reported, but at least 516 people were injured, 194 seriously including eight with life-threatening injuries”. \nThe Jerk And Jolt Doctrine \nIn McLellan, ‘Jerk and Jolt’ Doctrine Dooms Bus Passenger’s Injury Suit, law.com/sites/articles (6/15/2015) it was noted “A bus passenger who fell during her ride will not be able to take her personal injury case to a jury without demonstrating unusual movement of the bus, the Commonwealth (of Pennsylvania) Court has ruled”. The Court held that “‘A bus’ swerving to avoid pedestrians is in no way unusual in a busy city, and certainly not beyond a passenger’s reasonable expectation’...That doctrine...requires a plaintiff...to show ‘that the movement of the car was so unusual and extraordinary as to be beyond a passenger’s reasonable anticipation’ through evidence that the event ‘had an extraordinarily disturbing effect upon other passengers’ or resulted in an accident ‘or the effect of which upon the plaintiff inherently establishes the unusual character of the jolt or jerk’”. \nDisruptive Passenger Again \nIn Passenger restrained, strapped to his seat after attacking flight attendant, eturbonews.com (6/18/2015) it was noted that “A passenger allegedly attacked a flight attendant on an Etihad flight from Abu Dhabi to Australia after he was told he wasn’t allowed to smoke on the plane. The incident saw fellow travelers on flight EUY460 forced to restrain the man and he was tied to his seat using cable ties until the plane landed in Melbourne..’There was a lot of screaming, shouting and it was terrifying. There were six or seven men who held him down’”. \nUberChopper In Thailand \nIn Uber taxi in Bangkok and you may get a Uber chopper helicopter instead, eturbonews.com (6/18/2015) it was noted that “Uber...has chosen Bangkok as the first city in Southeast Asia to introduce a one-day free trial for its helicopter service. Thailand is among its three fastest-growing markets for its taxi app service in Southeast Asia...UberCopter or UberChopper as it is known in many markets, launched as a trial service from New York to the Hamptons in 2013\". \nTravel Law Article: Long Simmering Debate \nIn Isaac & Singer, California Says Uber Driver Is Employee, Not A Contractor, nytimes.com (6/17/2015) it was noted that “In a ruling that fuels a long-simmering debate over some of Silicon Valley’s fastest growing technology companies and the work they are creating, the California Labor Commissioner’s Office said that a driver for the ride-haling service Uber should be classified as an employee, not an independent contractor. The ruling ordered Uber to reimburse Barbara Ann Berwick $4,152.20 in expenses and other costs for the roughly eight weeks she worked as an Uber driver last year...The ruling does not apply beyond Ms. Berwick and could be altered if Uber’s appeal succeeds. Uber has also prevailed in at least five other states in keeping its definition of drivers as independent contractors...Yet labor activists and others have said such roles-with people working as freelancers and having little certainty over their wages and job status-are simply a way for companies like Uber to minimize costs, even as they maintain considerable control over drivers’ workplace behavior. They say that such control is typically the hallmark of an employee relationship, which should bring with it benefits, more stable pay and greater job security...In a statement, Uber said the decision was ‘nonbinding and applies to a single driver’. The company said individual cases about worker classification in at least five other states, including Georgia, Pennsylvania and Texas, have resulted in rulings that categorize drivers as contractors...The company...has rapidly upended entrenched taxi and transportation industries with its model of letting people hail rides via their smartphones. Uber...is now operating in more than 300 cities across six continents. To meet consumer demand, Uber’s driver ranks have swelled. At a presentation this month celebrating Uber’s fifth anniversary, Mr. Kalanick said the company had 26,000 drivers in New York City alone; 15,000 in London; 22,000 in San Francisco; 10,000 in Paris; and 20,000 in Chengdu, China. ‘Every single month, Uber is adding hundreds of thousands of drivers around the world’, Mr. Kalanick said”. \nCalifornia Labor Commissioner’s Decision \nIn Berwick v. Uber Technologies, Inc., State Case Number 11-46739 EK, Order, Decision Or Award Of The Labor Commissioner dated June 3, 2015 it was held, inter alia, that “Defendants hold themselves out as nothing more than a neutral technological platform, designed simply to enable drivers and passengers to transact the business of transportation. The reality, however, is that Defendants are involved in every aspect of the operation. Defendants vet prospective drivers who must provide to Defendants their personal banking and residence information, as well as their Social Security Number. Drivers cannot use Defendants’ application unless they pass Defendant’s background and DMV checks”. \nControlling The Tools \n“Defendants control the tools the drivers use; for example, drivers must register their cars with Defendants, and none of their cars can be more that ten years old. Defendants refer to ‘industry standards’ with respect to drivers’ cars, however, it is unclear to what industry, other than the ‘taxi’ industry, Defendants are referring. Defendants monitor the Transportation Drivers’ approval ratings and terminate their access to the application if the rating falls below a specific level (4.6 stars). While Defendants permit their drivers to hire people, no one other than Defendant’s approved and registered drivers are allowed to use Defendants’ intellectual property. Drivers do not pay Defendants to use their intellectual property”. \nSetting The Fees \n“The passengers pay Defendants a set price for the trip and Defendants, in turn, pay their drivers a non-negotiable service fee. If a passenger cancels a trip request after the driver has accepted it, and the driver has appeared at the pick-up location, the driver is not guaranteed a cancellation fee. Defendants alone have the discretion to negotiate this fee with the passenger. Defendants discourage drivers from accepting tips because it would be counterproductive to Defendant’s advertizing and marketing strategy”. \nNo Managerial Skills \n“Plaintiff’s car and her labor were her only assets. Plaintiff’s work did not entail any ‘managerial’ skills that could affect profit or loss. Aside from her car, Plaintiff had no investment in the business. Defendants provided the iPhone application, which was essential to the work. But for Defendants’ intellectual property, Plaintiff would not have been able to perform the work”. In light of the above, Plaintiff was Defendants’ employee. \nConclusion \nThe California Labor Commissioner’s decision and the decision by the Court in O’Connor v. Uber Technologies, Inc., 2015 WL 1069092 (N.D. Cal. 2015) strongly suggest that, at least, in California, Uber drivers may very well be employees subject to the protections afforded by California Labor Law. Stay tuned for the appeals. \nThe author, Justice Dickerson, has been writing about Travel Law for 39 years including his annually updated law books, Travel Law, Law Journal Press (2015) and Litigating International Torts in U.S. Courts, Thomson Reuters WestLaw (2015), and over 350 legal articles.
