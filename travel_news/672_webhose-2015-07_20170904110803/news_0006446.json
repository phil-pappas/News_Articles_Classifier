These months registered a year-on-year growth of 12.2 per cent, 7.1 per cent and 5.4 per cent respectively. \n\nBesides using the campaign to educate the travel trade and travellers on the destination’s year-round appeal, Tourism New Zealand has also tweaked its media activity schedule to arouse interest at different times of the year. \n\n“While we usually begin our media investments in September, this year we are running it from July to promote the shoulder season or spring and autumn. In fact, 80 per cent of our (marketing) efforts will now focus on the shoulder season. Previously it was about 20 per cent,” Bowler said. \n\n“I think it is the natural things that will also help us (better manage the summer arrivals and achieve more footfalls in the other months). Prices will be more reasonable during the shoulder seasons and availability will be much better as well,” he added. \n\nMeanwhile, the tourism bureau is connecting with travel agencies and airlines to share assets under the new campaign and to support these partners in their advertising and promotion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T19:13:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
