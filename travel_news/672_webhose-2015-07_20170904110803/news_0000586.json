Their plan was to make first tracks at Perisher in the fresh snow. Unfortunately, the only snowy tracks they’re leaving are on the highway.\n“We’ve been stuck for about an hour around Bowral,” the aptly named Mr White tells news.com.au .\n“I got out of the car before before and my foot was entirely engulfed by snow so I’d say there’s about 10cm on the ground. We’re totally stopped. We’ve travelled the length of two semi trailers in the last hour.”\nAn hour out of sydney and we are snowed in on the Hume Highway #snow #nowherenearperisher … https://t.co/NnLacnmbow\n— Darren White (@dazzawhitey) July 16, 2015\nAnother man suffering the same frustrations is Alex “Chumpy” Pullin, the dual snowboard cross world champion who carried Australia’s flag in the opening ceremony of last year’s Sochi Winter Olympics.\nHeading down to the snow and its a white hume hwy near Berrima. #winterdownunder pic.twitter.com/T1hBAjbCPj\n— Alex Chumpy Pullin (@chumpypullin) July 16, 2015\nWe gave Chumpy a bell and he, too, confirmed he was going nowhere for now.\n“I’m just off the highway near Bowral and we’re dead stopped. The trees are all covered with snow, which I’ve never seen on the highway before. I’m more used to seeing this sort of thing on the autobahn.”\n“I’ve got a few things lined up for today and I’m going to be late which is not really my style, but I couldn’t be more happy to see this much snow in Oz at the moment.”\nThe blob.
