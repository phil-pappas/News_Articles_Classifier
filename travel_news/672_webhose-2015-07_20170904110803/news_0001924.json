Friday through Sunday, July 10-12, there’s the new Chinook Fest Summit, at Snoqualmie Pass, starring soul man Allen Stone . Thursday through Saturday, July 16-18, the 3-year-old Timber! Outdoor Music Festival, held in Carnation, offers Philadelphia punk band the Dead Milkmen and Seattle favorites Tacocat and La Luz.\nChinook Fest was created by local musician Cody Beebe, who started with a festival in the Yakima Valley in 2012, with much the same goal as Timber! — to give people a chance to hear music while also experiencing the natural landscape of the Pacific Northwest.\nFestivals preview Chinook Fest Summit Friday-Sunday, July 10-12, The Summit at Snoqualmie; $35-$225 ( chinookfest.com ).\nTimber! Outdoor Music Festival Thursday-Saturday, July 16-18, 31023 N.E. 40th St, Ca rnation; $30-$400 ( timbermusicfest.com ).\nAt Snoqualmie Pass this year you can see local bands such as Barcelona and the Maldives, with X Ambassadors headlining Friday and Stone finishing off Saturday’s lineup. Other notable artists include country singer Kate Lynn Logan and “The Voice” competitor Austin Jenckes.\n At Chinook Fest, camping is a good plan for festivalgoers who may be too tired to drive home. Tent camping is available for $10 per person while RV spots are $80. Those not fond of roughing it can “glamp” with a pre-setup tent and camping area for $300 for two people.\nTimber!, the following week, has already found a following, but continues to evolve. One major change is that the festival now happens a week earlier, to avoid conflicting with Block Party. Timber! organizer Kevin Sur said the change is about making it easier on the fans, but it’s also logistical.\n“Honestly, the big thing for us it helps with is in terms of staffing,” Sur said. “We want to hire a lot of local security and whatnot and that was the biggest challenge, wanting to keep hiring local and having these two big events happening at the same time.”\nScheduling isn’t the only change. Campfire performances are being scaled back to just one artist per night — members of The Head and the Heart on July 17 and David Bazan on July 18 — with the hope that they will have the time and space to put on a more unstructured show, Sur said.\nThere will also be comedy for the first time, with Derek Sheen, Bri Pruett and Evan Morrison set to tell funny stories at the campfire stage Thursday night.\nBut Sur sounded most excited about veteran satirical punks the Dead Milkmen, known for its 1988 song “Punk Rock Girl.”\nSaid Sur, who saw the band when he was 13: “They are every bit as good now as they were the first time I saw them.”\nOwen R.
