(Dixie D. Vereen/For The Washington Post) Being the owner of a restaurant means getting to operate it the way you want. Just ask Sam Adkins, an alumnus of Jackie’s in Silver Spring and Cashion’s Eat Place in Adams Morgan.\nThe chef’s maiden restaurant, Sally’s Middle Name, ignores printed lists in favor of a big chalkboard menu. The successor to Pizza Parts & Service on H Street NE, the 42-seat newcomer also tacks onto customers’ bills an 18 percent gratuity. “I just wanted to get rid of that division” between employees working in the dining room and the kitchen, says Adkins, whose policy rewards the entire staff.\nThe restaurant’s quirky title? As a teenager, Adkins’s sister lamented the fact that she wasn’t given a middle name. Her brother (who could claim Ulysses) promised her he’d name his first restaurant after her, even before his career took off.\nSally’s Middle Name, awash in white tile, doesn’t distinguish between appetizers and main courses, although the prices hint that one plate might be more substantial than another. Since its June debut, the restaurant has played up vegetables. Peas and cucumbers go into a chilled yogurt soup, and green, yellow and pink beans make for a lovely three-bean salad mixed with purple olives and sherry vinaigrette. “It’s summer,” says the chef. “Vegetables are king right now.” Winter will probably be meatier, he predicts. The current selections are, however, “the way we want to eat.”\nSwiss chard stems are pickled, then lightly battered and deep-fried. (Dixie D. Vereen/For The Washington Post) Me, too. From the grilled broccoli punched up with chilies and anchovy to the pickled fried Swiss chard stems bound in a light beer batter, every vegetable-based plate I sampled was a hit. (In contrast, pork ribs spackled with cumin seed proved a wallflower.) Most memorable of all at an early dinner was a riff on poutine: french fries scattered with bits of rabbit and goat cheese curds that Adkins gets from Peachy Family Dairy in Pennsylvania.\nA riff on a French-Canadian staple, rabbit poutine merges bits of meat with french fries and goat cheese curds. (Dixie D. Vereen/For The Washington Post)\nChef and co-owner Sam Adkins is featuring a menu that plays up produce because “it’s summer. Vegetables are king right now.” (Dixie D. Vereen/For The Washington Post) Upstairs from Sally’s is a boutique, Akae, curated by the chef’s wife and restaurant co-owner, Aphra. On the budding fashion designer’s menu: baby clothes, ceramics and dresses. The second floor also includes an outdoor deck that the couple hope to make use of later this summer as an extension of the restaurant.\nClever to the last drop, Sally’s is decorated with shelves of coffee cups the owners collected from Goodwill and estate sales, which is where they also procured the mix of dishes used at the restaurant. “They chip easily,” says the chef of their vintage finds, “but that’s just another excuse to shop for plates.”\n1320 H St. NE. 202-750-6529. sallysmiddlename.com .
