Grab some wine and a special someone, take the cable car up the hill so you don’t arrive too out of breath, and settle in for a romantic evening the likes of which only Paris can offer. \nThe Champ de Mars \nEvery year, locals and tourists alike scramble to find a place to squat on the Champ de Mars, the great lawn that stretches nearly one kilometer from the base of the Eiffel Tower. It’s one of the most strategic spots in the city to catch the show, so be sure to arrive early to mark your territory. \nThe Montparnasse neighborhood \nEven if you’re not looking to drop €320 (RM1,354) on the prix fixe dinner being served at Le Ciel de Paris, the restaurant on the top floor of the Tour Montparnasse, there’s still reason to hang around. Just follow the crowds on foot heading up the avenue du Maine. The avenue has a decent incline and from there you will be perfectly in line with the Eiffel Tower, ideal for watching the show. \nThe Pont des Arts or the Pont Alexandre III \nIf you can’t be on the Seine itself, the next best thing might be to be over it, and some of the bridges in Paris are perfectly positioned for a great view of the fireworks. The Pont Alexandre III, which bridges the Invalides esplanade and the Grand and Petit Palais, will be practically under the fireworks, and the Pont de Arts, until recently referred to as the Locks of Love Bridge before the city took them all down, will have an unobstructed view as well. Just make sure to get there early as this is prime real estate and there isn’t much of it to go around. \nThe Parc de Belleville \nSo you want to sit in the grass and watch the fireworks but you don’t feel like fighting people off your blanket on the Champ de Mars? Head to the Parc de Belleville, located in the up and coming 20th arrondissement. It has the perfect hill to cop a view of the show in relative peace and you’ll want to come early to snag a spot at the top. — Afp-Relaxnews More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T04:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T07:00:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
