In terms of jobs we have grown at double the rate in the past two years, the only other sector to come close is retail. \n\"We have bold KPIs to help grow the industry such as 7,000 apprentices by 2016. This is already at 9,000 so you can see the opportunities for growth.\" \nLast week, the Association of Serviced Apartments announced it has added 30 new members in the past three months. \nThe additions to the body, which represents firms in the serviced apartment sector, means it now represents 120 organisations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T14:13:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
