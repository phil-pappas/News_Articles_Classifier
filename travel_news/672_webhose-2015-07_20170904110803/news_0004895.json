The Titanic pictured in 1912. Source: AP \nAN IMPORTANT piece of the Titanic that disappeared for 100 years and was thought lost forever has finally resurfaced. \nAnd now, the artefact has gone on show to the public in Spain. \nThe bronze and silver plaque was originally given to the shipbuilder once the doomed vessel was completed. The 1.8 kilogram object is inscribed with the ship’s name and the words ‘Queen of the Ocean’, along with the date of the ship’s final voyage: April 10, 1912. \nThere is also a light inside that displays the image of the vessel, and it contains the original electrical wiring.

However, when he asked the Titanic Foundation if they would be interested in displaying it at an exhibition at the Grenada Science Park called Titanic, the Reconstructio n this year, they jumped at the chance. \nIt’s now the main attraction at the exhibition, which runs until January next year. \nMr Sancho has been offered a “significant amount” for the plaque, but has no plans to sell it yet.
