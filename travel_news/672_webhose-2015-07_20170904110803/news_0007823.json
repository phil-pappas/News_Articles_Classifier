Make that several notches.\nOver the next three years, the cruise line will add several vessels to its two-ship fleet — along with its own Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft.\nThe launch of the 62-guest Crystal Esprit in December marks the beginning of a three-year major expansion program for Crystal Cruises. (Rendering contributed by Crystal Cruises). The excitement starts with the launch of the 62-guest Crystal Esprit in December, the first ship in the Crystal Yacht Cruises program. The all-suite yacht will feature a two-passenger submarine, four 10-passenger Zodiac boats for special excursions, and a 12-passenger Wider 32-foot super yacht tender for special adventures.\nThis, in addition to water skis, wake boards, kayaks and equipment for fishing, snorkeling and scuba diving.\nCruisers will have a long way to travel to experience Crystal Esprit, which will spend the next couple years in the Seychelles Islands, Dubai and the Adriatic Coast.\nA rendering of the marina area of Crystal Esprit, which will offer a two-passenger submarine along with all types of water sports equipment. (Contributed by Crystal Cruises) Crystal River Cruises will launch in the spring of 2017, though the line did not announce too many details beyond promising six-star service, world-class dining and spacious suites.\nAlso making its debut in 2017 will be Crystal Luxury Air. No worries about not getting enough leg room. This aircraft, designed for 300 passengers, will fly only 60 guests in fully reclining, business class seats.\nItineraries will be about 28 days long, visiting up to a dozen remote and/or sought-after locales, the cruise line said. Accommodations will be at top-rated hotels and resorts, with cuisine prepared by celebrity chefs.\nKate McCue takes the helm of Celebrity Summit in August as the first American female captain. (Contributed by Celebrity Cruises) Sounds like a cruise — without the water part.\nIn late 2018, the Crystal Exclusive Class of ships is expected to launch with the first of three new ships. Shipbuilder Lloyd Werft in Germany will build the polar ice class vessels. The all-suite, all-balcony ships will accommodate 1,000 guests\nSuites on the new ships will be a minimum of 400 square feet, and the crew-to-guest ration will be one-to-one.\nChris Hondros Former CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather will be aboard Seabourn Odyssey as part of a lecture series hosted by the cruise line.

The residences — no purchase prices announced yet — will range from 600 square feet to more than 4,000.\nLearn more about the cruise line’s plans at www.crystalthenextchapter.com.\nAT THE HELM\nCelebrity Cruises has named Kate McCue the cruise industry’s first American female captain.\nShe’ll be at the helm of the 2,158-guest Celebrity Summit, sailing from the Cape Liberty Cruise Port in New Jersey to Bermuda, beginning in August.\nThe 37-year-old McCue is a graduate of California State University’s California Maritime Academy and most recently served as Master Mariner with Royal Caribbean International.\nCELEBRITIES ON BOARD\nImagine bumping into Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak poolside, or rubbing elbows with journalist Dan Rather while enjoying dinner.\nThe two are among the lecturers for Seabourn Conversations, an onboard enrichment program featuring adventurers, artists, historians and the business elite sharing tales of success and personal insights.
