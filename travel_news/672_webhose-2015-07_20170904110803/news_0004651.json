We move even slower — imagining.\nFrom the front, this beguiling house is smaller than you expect. Of course, its lustful past (Profumo, Keeler, the Russian spy) means you can't help thinking you're up to no good, especially when two smartly dressed men suggest you leave your car keys in the ignition...\nI'm in baggy shorts and tatty shirt. Our luggage isn't in the Joan Collins class. My chin's not seen a razor all weekend.\nCliveden has been revived after years by the Livingstone brothers, after lying for years while run by the now defunct Von Essen group\nChristine Keeler, a nineteen year old rumoured mistress of a suspected Russian spy, who stayed at Cliveden in 1964\n'So, where did you park the helicopter?' says a confident, well-spoken young man who supervises our check-in.\n'Just behind the wall near the pool.' This is fun.\nAnd what's really good news is that Cliveden has been revived after years in a coma while run by the now defunct Von Essen group.\nThe secretive Livingstone brothers (who own Chewton Glen) have gone about restoring and updating the 44 bedrooms and refreshing the dining room and bar.\nAnd they have done so with aplomb. It helps, of course, when you have arguably the finest views of any hotel in the world, with glorious gardens and majestic woodland, never mind the Great Hall, with its rich red velvet sofas, tall lamps and spectacular fireplace. It fizzes with intrigue.\nAbove the grand piano, John Singer Sargent's Nancy Astor — the formidable U.S. divorcee (she told Churchill if she were his wife she'd poison his coffee) who married into the Establishment, watches over proceedings.\nWe are booked into a classic room, but are upgraded to a deluxe double, which is huge, with a marble bathroom the size of an average bedroom.\nWe are given a time of 7.45pm for dinner, but arrive 15 minutes late then push our luck by asking if we can still have a drink in the bar and order food from there.\nThis seems to invite the proverbial spanner to turn up.\n Next An Inspector Calls: Making a big Deal of Bear's Well - a...

'I would need to check,' says a waiter, even though there are only five or six tables occupied in the dining room.\n'Normally, we like to explain the menu at the table.' And so we go straight to the table, where we're joined by a ravishing pea puree dip with toasted parmesan.\nAll very lovely, but I'm surprised that the waiter does not know what wines are offered by the glass and there doesn't seem to be a sommelier to hand on this Sunday evening.\nThe entrance to Cliveden, a National Trust property in Berkshire that is now a hotel\nA Japanese couple occupies the best table in the room, with sweeping views down to the Thames.\nThey've opted for the tasting menu but seem to have lost the taste for conversation and commune only with their mobiles.\nNext morning we wake to the sound of the scrunching drive. At breakfast, a kite puts on a show above the lawn. But what's this?\nThe orange juice is from a carton rather than freshly squeezed. And we think the buffet is more three stars than five. But, overall, this is a glorious revival that will run and run.\nTRAVEL FACTS: Plan your own stay Rating:\nCliveden\nTaplow\nBerks\nSL6 OJF\nclivedenhouse.co.uk\nA special rate for Daily Mail readers, of £495 in a Club Room, includes breakfast, three-course dinner for two and a complimentary bottle of champagne.\nOffer valid until September 30.\nCall 01628 668561 or email reservations@clivedenhouse.co.uk and Quote: the Daily Mail Inspector Calls promotion.\nRead more: Cliveden House | Luxury Country House Hotel in Berkshire, near London", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1GNqF4T", "http://www.clivedenhouse.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-07-25T18:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T13:19:49.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
