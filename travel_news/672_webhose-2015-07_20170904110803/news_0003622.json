At HMH we are penetrating this segment with our ECOS Hotels, introducing to the Dubai market in 2016 a ‘no frills’ B&B brand tying together a unique economical and green concept.” \nThe report also said that Dubai’s appetite for luxury is still present as alongside the 5-star Palm Tower on Palm Jumeirah, some of the most luxurious properties the city has seen will open in coming years. \n2015 openings include 5-star Palazzo Versace at Dubai Creek, movie-themed Paramount Hotel in Downtown, Starwood’s first St Regis Dubai on Sheik Zayed Road, and the first Hard Rock Hotel in the Middle East in Marina 101, the second tallest building in the UAE behind the Burj Khalifa. \nThe Hotel Show Dubai will take place September 28-30 at the Dubai World Trade Centre, with over 650 international exhibitors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T08:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T10:04:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
