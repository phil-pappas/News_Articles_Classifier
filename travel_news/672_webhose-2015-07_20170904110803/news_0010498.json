It will be turned on at sunset on July 7.\nThe park service said much of the lighting system was installed below ground and damaged in Superstorm Sandy. Musco had installed a temporary system.\nThe new permanent system is expected to reduce energy consumption.\nMusco systems are also in place at the Washington Monument, the White House and the Flight 93 National Memorial.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T01:43:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
