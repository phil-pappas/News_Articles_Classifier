(iStock photo) \nRains are known for their clammy nature, often causing acne, rashes and hair breakage. Add to this, the make-up woes, such as running mascaras or smudging rouge. But don’t let the monsoon dampen your spirit. Here, a few experts put together a set of tried-and-tested beauty tips. Make-up “Listen to your skin; if it’s feeling dry, you may want to opt for a moisturiser. Most importantly, drink water at regular intervals,” says Natasha Nischol, co-owner and co-founder of make-up academy Fat Mu. 1. Start with a good primer for the face and the eyes. It will keep your base and eye make-up in place. 2. Humidity can make your skin oily, so avoid using cream-based foundations. Instead, use liquid-based ones or a powder foundation. Dry skin can handle creams, but use them frugally. 3. Use lip and cheek stains in liquid or pencil form, and paint pots and pencils for eyeshadows. Opt for a water-proof mascara and eyeliners. You can also go for gel-based eyeliners. 4. When it comes to lipsticks, pick hot pinks, oranges and reds in matte finish, as it has more impact. Gloss can smear and stick on windswept hair. Haircare “Frizzy hair is a common problem during monsoon, as human hair is very susceptible to moisture. It is caused by a larger number of hydrogen bonds formed as a result of excessive moisture in the air. Make sure you have a well-thought-out-care regime to take into account the drastic change in weather,” says Dr Harshna Bijlani, co-founder and medical head, The Ageless Clinic. 1. Use hair serum at night, and massage into scalp and the shaft. 2. The next day, wash hair with a mild shampoo, and apply a restructuring hair mask in the shower. Allow hot water to flow so that steam is created. Keep the restructuring hair mask on for 10 minutes and then rinse. 3. Apply deep-conditioning hair-mask. 4. Keep for 20 minutes and then rinse. 5. Finish by using some serum 6. Wash your hair thrice a week (or more if oily – daily washing does not cause hair fall). Skincare A widely held misconception is that sunrays are milder during the monsoon. So, many tend to skip using a sunscreen lotion. However, experts strongly advice against this. “Sunblock is a must. The UVA and UVB rays are just as harmful during monsoon, as they penetrate through the clouds and play havoc with our skin,” says Nisha Javeri, founder and CEO, Myrah Spa.
