The hoteliers Ira Drukier, Richard Born and Sean MacPherson, who own several other boutique hotels in New York City together, such as the Jane and the Bowery, bought the abandoned red-brick building from a real-estate developer and spent two years fashioning it into luxury accommodations with a contemporary design. The Ludlow, opened in June 2014, includes the hard-to-book restaurant Dirty French, which is from the same team as Carbone and Parm. The property also has a lovely garden with six tables and brick walls partly covered in ivy, as well as heating, allowing it to remain open year-round.\nLocation The Ludlow is in the heart of the Lower East Side, one of the city’s most desirable areas for the hip and youthful set. New York institutions like Katz’s Deli and Bowery Ballroom are within walking distance. And it is near hot-ticket restaurants and bars, bakeries and indie boutiques. Two subway lines, the F and the 6, are within a 10-minute walk.\nRoom There are 10 room categories ranging from a Studio Full to the Penthouse Suite. Our 235-square-foot Studio Queen had a large window overlooking lively Essex Street, which was great for people-watching. Its stylish décor included a black and cream silk rug, with a series of varied patterns, adorning the dark wood floors; cream-painted wood beams; an oversize round brass chandelier, handmade in Marrakesh; and a charming, tiny round white-marble table with two purple velvet chairs and a dark wood bed with a comfortable queen mattress.\nBathroom Snug but aesthetically fun, the bath had robes from the trendy Parisian fashion label Maison Margiela white tiled walls, black-and-white checked floors and a white marble sink with brass fixtures and a large brass mirror. The shower stall had a rain-shower head, and though the water pressure was moderate at best, the toiletries from the luxe brand Red Flower made up for it.\nAmenities Besides the garden, there’s a lobby lounge with a limestone gas fireplace, oversize chandeliers, Moroccan rugs and vintage furniture. A small but airy gym is on the 20th floor. The intensely popular bistro Dirty French is on the entry level of the hotel, and hotel guests are given priority reservations. Guests can also order from the menu and have their meal served in the garden.\nBreakfast A continental breakfast, part of the room rate, is offered at Dirty French starting at 7 a.m. seven days a week. The three choices are served à la carte, and include a plate of in-season fruit such as pluots and papayas, a pastry basket from the French bakery Balthazar and yogurt with granola. Additional items and room service are also available but for a charge.\nBottom Line The Ludlow wins high marks for its neighborhood feel and is a smart choice for travelers looking for an authentic sense of place away from the crowds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T16:16:08.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
