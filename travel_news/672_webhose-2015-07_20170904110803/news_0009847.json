Prawle Point, Devon This walk around Prawle Point, Devon 's southern-most tip, is only a few miles from the busy resort town of Salcombe, and yet feels gloriously remote. The name stems from the old English Praewhyll, a \"look out hill\", and the area's history is a distraction in itself, from the ancient field systems and boundary walls at Gammon Head to the ships that foundered on the rugged coastline. Read a full description of the route The views from Prawle Point are some of the most attractive on the South West Coast Path Photo: Alamy 2. Old Harry Rocks, Dorset This walk alongside white chalk stacks believed to be named after a local notorious pirate, Harry Paye, is one of the best ways to take in the Jurassic Coast. Alongside the magnificent geological formations, those who visit in spring and summer can expect to see scarlet pimpernels, poppies, sheep's bit and harebells, alongside distinctive pink pyramidal orchids. • The UK's best coastal walks in pictures Chalkhill Blue butterflies can also often be found feeding from yellow kidney vetch flowers, while it is not uncommon to see peregrine falcons hunting for food for their young.

Stonebarrow, Dorset With the Golden Cap itself prominent in the landscape and the Isle of Portland sitting in the far horizon on a clear day, this walk offers picnic spots with \"great views\" all along the hilltop, before moving onto the landscapes that characterised Thomas Hardy’s Wessex, says Helen Mann, the general manager for the west and north Dorset region. Read a full description of this route 4. Brownsea Island, Dorset \"Going to Brownsea is just like setting off on holiday,” says Phil Dyke, the National Trust’s coast and marine adviser, “You have to get there on a boat, it’s a proper journey. It feels like another world. Turn around and look at Poole and it seems miles away.” • The best hotels in Dorset Once you have reached Brownsea Island, set spectacularly in the middle of Poole Harbour in Dorset, it will take just a short stroll to see what Phil means. Read a full description of the route The only way to reach Brownsea Island is by boat Photo: AP 5. White Cliffs of Dover, Kent There really are few places like them. Put aside the endless clichés and poetic words: the White Cliffs of Dover make for a special landscape indelibly tied to its history. “The White Cliffs are more than the sum of their parts,” says Gareth Wiltshire of the National Trust. “There’s more here than you anticipate, but it’s almost as much about the concept as the place. People see it through their own eyes, they bring their own preconceptions here. The idea of the cliffs is as important as what they are, a national symbol.” Read a full description of the route A walk along the White Cliffs of Dover is a simple but rewarding route. Photo: AP 6. Blakeney, Norfolk The North Norfolk coast is a great place for blustery walks, with its huge skies, wide expanses of salt marsh and superb birdlife. This walk takes your around a lesser-known stretch of the Blakeney National Nature reserve. • The UK's best coastal walks in pictures As George Baldock, National Trust assistant ranger at Blakeney, explains: “When asked about Blakeney National Nature Reserve, most people think of Blakeney Point, and the seals and terns. Blakeney Freshes is another area of the reserve, equally as important for wildlife and managed for breeding waders and over-wintering wildfowl. This walk takes you along the sea wall, around the Freshes, with amazing views of the whole Nature Reserve. Read a full description of the route Northern England 7. Whitehaven, Cumbria The coastline around Whitehaven is some of Cumbria 's best. This walk takes in Candlestick, Haig, Birkham’s quarry, and RSPB viewpoints, while those interested in ornithology will be attracted by the only breeding colony of black guillemots in England. • The UK's best coastal walks in pictures As Chris Gomersall, National Trust ranger at Whitehaven says: “With this route prepare yourself for an exhilarating coastal walk between Whitehaven and St Bees, two places that are steeped in history and rich in wildlife. St Bees Head, the most westerly point in Cumbria, is where St Bega, an Irish nun was shipwrecked in the ninth century. Black guillemots, puffins and terns are among the birdlife along this stretch of coast. Read a full description of the route 8. Lindisfarne and Holy Island, Northumberland Although best known from its west approach, from Holy Island village, Lindisfarne Castle is beautiful from all angles, and one of the reasons that this route is so satisfying is that it allows walkers to appreciate it from all sides. Not only will those who venture here be able to admire this 16th-century building: they may glimpse dolphins, curlews and oystercatchers as they look out to sea. • 10 best British hikes Nick Lewis, house steward at Lindisfarne Castle, said that the castle appears \"lazily stretched out on its rocky ledge, almost like one of the hundreds of grey seals on the beaches opposite.\" Read a full description of the route This route takes walkers around Lindisfarne Castle, on Holy Island Photo: AP 9. Formby, near Liverpool If you arrive at Formby by train, you may wonder if you are in the right place. But while the local station, Freshfield, feels urban, a mile or so due west lies one of the country’s most exhilarating coastal dune landscapes. • Great days out in the UK Formby is a spectacular expanse of beach, sand dunes and pines on the edge of a metropolis. Many National Trust coasts are remote, but Formby, forming part of Liverpool Bay, is an easy day out from Liverpool. It is important for waders and provides a woodland home for the red squirrel. The well-drained, sandy soil is ideal for asparagus growing and the Trust has a tenant farmer who continues to cultivate it (see points nine and 10 of this walk). Read a full description of the route The Formby coastline, backed by forest, is ideal for a walk in spring, summer or winter Photo: AP Wales 10. Gower peninsula This walk along the Gower Peninsula takes in Whiteford Burrows, the first land acquired by the National Trust in a National Nature Reserve. Highlights of the landscape include corrugated sand dunes and their pate of wispy, grassy hair while the skylarks, common blue butterflies and marsh irises are also a joy. • The best hotels in Wales Whiteford Burrows was the first land acquired by the National Trust in a National Nature Reserve. Photo: AP This National Nature Reserve and Special Area of Conservation is also renowned for its sand dune flora and insects, its beach strandline communities, and wading birds. The dunes adjoin the extensive salt marsh of Llanrhidian Marsh and the freshwater marsh of Cwm Ivy Marsh and are still moderately mobile, though the inner system has been planted with conifers. The dune slacks (wet hollows) are particularly rich in flowers and lichens. Read a full description of the route 11. Stackpole From ancient Cambrian limestone wrapping around blue sea, to grasslands covered in thrift and lakes in waterlilies, this walk takes in a diverse range of landscapes. • The UK's best coastal walks in pictures Christopher Oliver – National Trust head ranger at the Stackpole Estate, in the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park – says that alongside the dramatic views, walkers may see gannets nesting and feeding off the coast, and the lucky may spot chough, too.

Inverewe Gardens Walking the Pinewood Trail allows visitors to explore Inverewe Gardens, a lush oasis on the shores of Loch Ewe in western Scotland , to see how the landscape has developed over thousands of years. The Gulf stream here allows plant species normally too delicate for the harsh Scottish climate to flourish. Read a full description of the route Inverewe Gardens benefit from the Gulf Stream, which allows lush sub-tropical species to grow in Scotland Photo: AP 13. Burg, Isle of Mull Burg on Mull's Ardmeanach Peninsula is home to 200-million-year-old fossils, an Iron Age farm, and volcanic soils that allow rare plants to thrive, and provide grazing lands for red deer and wild goats. Insect species that might be spotted on this route include rare slender Scotch burnet moth, the chimney sweep moth and the dark green fritillary butterfly. The coastal path - tricky to negotiate in places - offers breathtaking views of Staffa and the Treshnish Isles. Read a full description of the route 14. Torridon Torridon's rugged mountains, loch waters and green deer parks hold some of Scotland's best views. Even without the summits of mountains such as Beinn Eighe, lower-level exploration has much to offer, with the estate hosting a varied flora and fauna. Read a full description of the route Red deer roam the area around Torridon Photo: AP Northern Ireland 15. Runkerry This route around Runkerry affords dramatic, far-reaching clifftop views, with visitors able to look out over the famous stepped stones of Giant’s Causeway in Northern Ireland . Legend has it that these are the remains of a bridge built across the Northern Channel by Finn MacCool, an Irish giant, so that he could fight Benandonner, his Scottish counterpart. On a clear day the Scottish Isle of Islay (over 20 miles away) is also visible.
