The U.S. government is investigating possible collusion among major airlines, including Chicago-based United, to limit available seats, which keeps airfares high. ( Gregory Karp ) If luggage is lost during security, or if jewelry or electronics end up missing from a bag, passengers can file a claim with the TSA ( http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/claims-management-branch ).\nAbout 55 percent of those claims are denied, TSA spokesman Michael McCarthy told the Tribune.\nHe cautioned that the claim numbers are small in comparison with the close to 2.5 million pieces of luggage that are screened every day.\nc Comments Obviously, the government needs to set up a new policing agency to protect travelers from the TSA.

About 6.4 million were screened in 2010, and by 2013, the last numbers given by a TSA spokesman, that number was about 7.1 million.\nAt O'Hare, according to McCarthy, about 23 million passengers were screened in 2013.\nThis isn't the first time the TSA has been criticized for lax suitcase security. A CNN article this year reported that the TSA has fired more than 500 officers for stealing items since 2002.\nIn 2011, two employees were arrested and accused of stealing nearly $40,000 from checked baggage at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York.\nIn 2012, the TSA started having agents pose as travelers and submit test items through screening. In these \"integrity tests,\" the agency says it has a pass rate of 99.9 percent.\nWhat can travelers do to avoid the dread of not getting to a destination with their suitcase, laptop or jewelry?\nOne option is shrink-wrapping your checked luggage, a service available at some large airports for a small fee, said Stacey Vogler, managing director for Assurant's Protect Your Bubble, which provides travel insurance.\nAnd travel insurance — Assurant's starts at $15 a day — saves you stress about replacing your items, or a \"hassle or nightmare\" with the TSA, she said.\nBut your best bet?\n\"The safest way to keep things that you really value safe is to not bring them with you,\" she said. \"Keep it in your carry-on rather than a bag that you're going to check, and at least it's with you; it's not out of your sight.\"\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/TSA-Workers-Busted-for-Stealing-Nearly-40K-From-Checked-Baggage-116326209.html", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5595b7cf/turbine/sc-trav-0702-tsa-baggage-loss-claims-20150702", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55942dce/turbine/ct-airlines-investigation-collusion-20150701", "http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/claims-management-branch", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/07/02/tsa-damage-tops-3m/29353815/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-558b0b7d/turbine/ct-united-airlines-flight-training-0625-biz-20150624"], "published": "2015-07-02T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T16:27:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
