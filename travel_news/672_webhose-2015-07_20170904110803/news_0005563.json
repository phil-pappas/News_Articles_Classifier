He lives in a castle turned bed-and-breakfast in La Flocellière, a small town in the Vendée, a region on the western coast of France known historically as a stronghold of French monarchists. As bed-and-breakfasts go, it cuts a striking figure, with its towers and medieval tapestries and ancestral portraits, set among trees imported from around the world in the early 1800s, including American cedars and sequoias. The castle, which is near the Loire Valley , was in the viscount’s family until it was sacked during the French Revolution, leaving much of it a crumbled ruin. Mr. Vignial, 73, had heard about it for years, but never visited until he was 36, after it was put up for sale. “It was in the winter,” he said. “My wife was completely afraid because it was nothing; completely closed, cold,” he said. But he knew he had to buy it. “I decided in five minutes,” he laughed. “I didn’t tell it to my wife.” Where a Prince Might Lay His Head Where a Prince Might Lay His Head Credit Alex Cretey-Systermans for The New York Times I arrived at the castle, known as the Château de la Flocellière, after a series of misadventures suited for a French farce. I had flown into Nantes, which is notionally an hour’s drive north of the castle, to write an article on Puy du Fou , an eccentric and engaging nearby historical attraction that is France’s second-largest theme park, after Euro Disney. I was traveling midweek and booked a room for about $160, which seemed like a good price for a castle, though I don’t have a lot of experience staying in castles. The drive from Nantes did not go as planned. First, I thought the rental car I picked up had a flat tire, and tried to explain that to a man at the counter in my exceedingly inadequate French. A series of mutual hand gestures failed to accomplish much, until I finally remembered the word “gonfler,” which means ‘inflate.’ I had heard it a couple of hours earlier on an airplane video explaining that an oxygen bag above my head would inflate in an emergency. “Gonfler!” I said. The two employees now gathered around my car immediately brightened. “Ah, gonfler!” Problem solved. At least until the navigation system started speaking to me. In Italian. I know only a single word in Italian, a curse word, and I felt as if that was a good time to start using it, which I did. Loudly. I pulled over to the side of a busy airport road and started fiddling with the manual. Minutes passed, the sun drooped, but eventually I had the car speaking to me in a British accent.

Mistake. From Nantes, highways will get you to La Flocellière in relatively short order, but that’s not the route I was taking. And the French countryside, it turns out, is being overrun by roundabouts. I successfully navigated a great many, but not all of them, and several were so new that my soothing navigation system, now purring along in the Queen’s English, seemed to be increasingly aggrieved by my orbital driving patterns. An errant turn off one of these freshly paved roundabouts led me onto a one-way street, the wrong way, leaving me face to face with a student driver. Excusez moi! By now the car’s polite British voice had turned more aggressive. “Turn around when possible! Turn around when possible!” I started to wish I could turn the Italian back on. About a dozen more roundabouts later, I reached La Flocellière, a town of about 2,400. You’d think finding a castle in a French village would be easy, but it was dark and this wasn’t an Econo Lodge lit up on the side of a highway. After several passes through the town, I located the giant chateau behind a gate. The castle has four towers, including a large central keep, though some sections of the chateau remain in ruins, adding to its mystique. I went inside and began to speak a few lines of carefully rehearsed French, since I had had a couple of hours to practice. This was perhaps not the best idea. Erika Vignial, the viscountess of the castle, proceeded as if I had a working knowledge of French, perhaps being polite. I wasn’t entirely clear what was happening after that. The Vignials, to their credit, are a far more welcoming brand of aristocrat than you might imagine. The dishes came out. There was fish first — white fish and salmon. And rice. And little baguettes. I ate, and I was well satisfied. I prepared to leave, but then Mrs. Vignial brought out a plate of veal and cheese tarts, then big tomato slices. Merci, bon. Fromage? I got the sense that it would be in poor taste to leave now, so the cheese came. I ate it. And it was good. And so was the mousse that followed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T18:36:22.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
