In reply to calls from UK businesses for more themed nights the university venue has launched a fresh list of events for this festive period. Keele University Conferences and Events’ 2015 Christmas Calendar now includes the 1920’s themed ‘The Great Gatsby Night’, ‘Casino Night’ and the ‘Black and White Ball’ which will be held at its Keele Hall venue, the grade-II listed building on the Keele University campus in the heart of the Staffordshire countryside. \nMarcus Wilson, head of marketing at Keele University, comments: “After an eventful series of celebrations last year, we’ve once again, listened to the businesses that use our venues and they asked for more themed nights to add sparkle to what is traditionally corporate Christmas. While we were planning our new range of themed calendar events we saw a chance to hold a Roaring Twenties party and celebrate what is a ‘missed decade’ for Keele Hall, which was vacant during that era. The Great Hall and the Library are perfectly suited to the time thanks to the ornate, yet traditional décor. We’re excited to see the Charleston and some other great dancing from the iconic age make its first appearance at Keele Hall. “We’ve also planned our ‘Traditional Christmas Party Nights’ which make the most of the roaring fireplace and traditional features at Keele Hall. And for our corporate customers there is the option to have one of our evenings exclusively for their business, making it a special evening for all employees.” Keele Hall, Staffordshire’s largest events venue will host events throughout November and December 2015, welcoming more than 5,000 people to their annual Christmas celebrations. Those attending the parties have the opportunity of staying at the newly refurbished Keele Management Centre and as part of their stay being allowed to take advantage of the door-to-door taxi service from the party and back. An overnight stay costs £54 per double room, and has access to the late-night bar for after the party.
