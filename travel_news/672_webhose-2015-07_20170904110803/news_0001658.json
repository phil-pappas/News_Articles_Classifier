And the art references didn’t stop there.\nDesigners such as Viktor and Rolf (above), Alexis Mabille and Maison Margiela sent models out wearing deconstructed paintings, giant bows and tapestry designs with landscape scenes that paid homage to styles of impressionism.\nJohn Galliano, for his official return to Paris Couture Week at Margiela, pulled off another feat: getting dramatic doona dresses wrapped-and-strapped around models with trompe l’oeil net make-up.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, high-society favourites Valentino, Atelier Versace and Christian Dior focused on ankle-grazing silk designs dripping in sequins and feathers.\nA model walks the runway during the Maison Margiela show.

Polished silhouettes come in satins and double-bonded knits that read grown up, not girlie.\nFounder Nicholas Van Messner says technology has come a long way since they started the brand 13 years ago. “It’s about exploring what is happening right now — double-knits that have a lot more body, and we’ve always played around with hard and soft fabrics,” he said.\nlifewithbird.com\nOriginally published as Couture a lesson in art", "external_links": ["http://www.davidlawrence.com.au/", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227437/946976-3eaac03a-26af-11e5-b33b-dc629bef0d9a.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227437/947002-fca9e518-2694-11e5-8167-f00e54f05f28.jpg", "http://www.target.com.au/b/collettedinniganfortheaustralianballet", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227437/944922-32a85e7e-2695-11e5-8167-f00e54f05f28.jpg", "http://www.lifewithbird.com/", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/style-snippets-dramatic-couture-collections-a-lesson-in-art/story-fni0d7e5-1227437947030"], "published": "2015-07-12T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T00:13:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
