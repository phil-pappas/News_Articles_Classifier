(Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP) By Paul Farhi July 22 at 1:08 PM Follow @farhip Bill Simmons, the popular sports journalist and pundit long associated with ESPN, has signed a deal with HBO, the cable network said.\nSimmons will host a weekly talk show next year as part of the agreement, which HBO described as exclusive, multi-year and covering TV and other media. No financial terms were disclosed.\nThe brash and opinionated Simmons became a marquee player during 14 years at ESPN, both on the air and in its print and digital publications. His comments, typically about sports but also wandering into pop culture, were widely followed by sports fans on the air and via social media.\nHe was also the founder of and columnist for the ESPN-owned Grantland, a sports-and-culture Web site, and a co-founder of the network’s critically lauded “30 for 30” series of sports documentaries.\nBut Simmons also feuded, publicly and privately, with Disney-owned ESPN, particularly in the past year. A major point of contention was his denunciation of NFL commissioner Roger Goodell on Simmons’s podcast, “The B.S. Report,” last year. Simmons repeatedly called Goodell a “liar” for his handling of the Ray Rice domestic violence case. ESPN suspended him in September for three weeks.\nThe comments and suspension apparently exacerbated Simmons’s chilly relations with ESPN’s management. ESPN televises “Monday Night Football” and has a multibillion-dollar agreement with the NFL.\nHBO has not been a major player in sports programming, but it has televised championship boxing matches, aired sports documentaries and talk programs. It has long aired “Real Sports,” a “60 Minutes”-style investigative reporting and discussion program hosted by Bryant Gumbel.\nSimmons’s as-yet-unnamed talk show will feature sports and pop-culture topics, HBO said in announcing its agreement.\nHe will also produce video podcasts and other features and will work with HBO’s sports division on “non-boxing-related programming, including shows and documentaries.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@farhip"], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T20:44:23.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
