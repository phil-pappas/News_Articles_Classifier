The Dallas Morning News reported Friday that the final two US Airways flights will leave Oct. 16 at 9:55 p.m. â€” one from San Francisco to Philadelphia and the other from Phoenix to Denver. The San Francisco-to-Philadelphia flight is scheduled to land after the flight leaving from Phoenix, and will be the final US Airways flight ever. At PTI, Baker said there may be a situation where two smaller airplanes are replaced with one bigger airplane. As American Airlines looks at its fleet mix going forward, it will probably be looking at which planes are less efficient and replace them. Baker said American Airlines will eventually evaluate how all of its flights are performing. \"They may well cut flights; they may add flights,\" he said. \"We've talked to them about adding other flights.\" Since the airlines' merger was completed in December 2013, US Airways and American have been combining various parts of the business such as reservation systems and frequent-flier rewards systems. As of Oct. 17, all flights will be listed as American Airlines flights. Charlotte Douglas International Airport, once home to US Airways' largest hub, is now the second-largest hub in American Airlines' network. Changes in the carrier's route strategy have trimmed the number of international flights from CLT . Service remains roughly the same as before the merger. \nWant Greensboro/Winston-Salem Logistics & Transportation news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
