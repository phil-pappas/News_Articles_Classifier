Photograph by: Suzanne Morphet , Postmedia News \nThree lions are eyeing their next meal, if only they could catch it. \nA dozen red lechwe – a type of antelope – are standing about 100 metres away. \nIn between the lions and the lechwe lies a shallow channel, choked with reeds, purple and white water lilies, and probably a crocodile or two. \n“Lions need an element of surprise,” says our guide, Emang. “They’re probably wondering how they can get closer without the lechwe seeing them.” \nWe had intended to spend the morning exploring this sliver of Botswana’s Okavango Delta by mokoro, the traditional dugout canoe. But when we arrive at the small dock where the mokoros wait, we discover the lions – a mother and her two sub-adult offspring. They sit in the shade of some trees, intently watching the lechwe. \n“Ladies first,” Emang jokes. But there’s no way we can leave the safety of the vehicle for the mokoros. Besides, when nature hands you a spectacle this good, you take it. We settle in to watch something that could be straight out of a National Geographic documentary. \nYet the sun’s warmth and the scent of wild sage remind us this is happening now, right before our eyes. \nWhen a guinea fowl screeches, followed by the alarming call of a red-billed spurfowl, the lechwe stop grazing and stand at attention, their spiral horns clearly visible above the long reeds. “They’ve picked it up,” says Emang of the bird sounds. \nLechwe are suited to this wet landscape with elongated hoofs that don’t get stuck in the mud. But lions have also adapted. And now, with the lechwe alert to danger, they make their move. They walk to the edge of the channel, and without hesitating, swim across. \n“There can be crocodiles here,” says Emang as we watch, entranced. “That’s their main concern.” \nThe lions safely reach the other side, but the lechwe have run off. Should we be relieved or disappointed? \nEmang breaks our collective silence with another wisecrack. “The mokoro was amazing, eh?” he says with a laugh. \nActually, everything about this watery wilderness is amazing. The Okavango Delta is a huge inland delta in the middle of a desert, the Kalahari. After the rainy season ends in April, the annual floods begin. Water flows down from Angola, 1,000 kilometres to the north. So even in the dry season – from May through November – there’s enough water to support a huge diversity of flora and fauna. \nThe Big Five – buffalo, lion, leopard, elephant and rhino – are here, as well as large herds of zebra, wildebeest and giraffe. Water-loving hippos, crocodiles and sitatunga favour the lagoons and channels while spotted hyena, wild dog and cheetah stick to islands and ridges. \nBird life is equally rich, with more than 400 species, including my favourite, the African jacana, also known as the Jesus bird because it appears to walk on water. \nLandlocked Botswana’s approach to tourism in the Okavango Delta has been careful and deliberate. Instead of encouraging budget tourism for the masses, the government has focused on low-volume, highvalue tourists to get the biggest bang for the least environmental cost. \nIt does this by leasing big chunks of land to private safari companies, then closely regulating their activities. “We are very strict,” said Lops Rampeba, the camp manager at Vumbura Plains South, over dinner on my first evening. This camp and 16 others in the delta are owned and/or operated by Wilderness Safaris , an acclaimed ecotourism company that works in eight African countries. \n“Wilderness Safaris is first and foremost a conservation company,” Lops explains, with a passion for protecting the wilderness and increasing biodiversity. \nLast year, for example, it participated in 87 research and conservation projects, such as reintroducing the black rhino to its former range. \nCamps are a lot more luxurious than you might expect for a company with such a strong conservation ethic. At Vumbura Plains, the camp perches on the edge of a huge floodplain in the shade of large, leafy trees. Six rooms made with timber, canvas and thatch are connected by a winding boardwalk and offer sweeping views over a sea of reeds. Private plunge pools and indoor/outdoor showers are included. \nThe morning we watched the lions prey on the lechwe, my small group had the action all to ourselves. \nSince this is a private reserve and guides work for the same company, they give each other lots of elbow room. \nTravelling to my next camp – Abu Camp – by bush plane I can see how vast and green the delta is. Abu Camp is all about elephants. Half the elephants in Africa live in Botswana, camp manager Aaron Gjellstad explains. But the highlight for most guests is not the wild elephants; rather it’s the herd of trained elephants that call Abu home. Most were orphaned, but several of the original herd came from North America where they spent decades in captivity. One of those – the matriarch Cathy – is still alive. \nOne morning I join the elephants on a walking safari through open woodland. Another day I climb onto Cathy’s back for a safari with the best views yet, high above the mopane trees she likes to nibble on. \nIt’s at Abu that I also experience the mokoro. Lenk, my guide, stands in the back of the boat and pushes us silently through the reeds with a long pole. He points out creatures I wouldn’t have noticed, like a tiny iridescent reed frog. “They’re the ones that make the click-click sound you hear at night,” he says. \nAs the big red sun begins to set, the silhouette of a lone elephant appears on the horizon – the picture-perfect ending to another amazing day in the Okavango Delta. \nThe writer was hosted by Wilderness Safaris, South African Airways and the Royal Livingstone Hotel.
