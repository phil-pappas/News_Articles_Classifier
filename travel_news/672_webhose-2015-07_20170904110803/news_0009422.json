The layout of the site wasn’t as inviting or friendly as Facebook’s traditional layout has been and we still haven’t seen any indication that Google really gets how the social web works,” Google explained on its official blog.\n 28, 2015 12:38 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T12:24:52.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
