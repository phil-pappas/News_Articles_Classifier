That’s fewer pixels than either Samsung’s Galaxy S6 or the LG G4, both of which pack 16 megapixel sensors, but the lower megapixel count allows for individual pixels to be made bigger. Bigger pixels capture more light per pixel than smaller ones and this, in turn, reduces the amount of digital noise or “grain” showing up in photos, especially in low light situations.\nA trade off between noise and resolution\nIn the case of the OnePlus 2, the sensor pixels are 1.3 microns in size, that’s actually a little smaller than the 1.5 micron sized pixels of the 8 megapixel iPhone 6, but larger than the 1.1 micron pixels of the Samsung Galaxy S6. This places the OnePlus 2 in the middle of the two competitors in terms of both resolution and pixel size.\nREAD MORE – Galaxy S6 Gets Super-Fast Rival: Quick Draw Cameras\nTrading these parameters off against each other is a delicate balancing act. If OnePlus’s sample images prove to be representative of real world performance, then this seems to have paid off. Current rumours surrounding the forthcoming iPhone 6S suggest that Apple Apple may be about to upgrade the camera from 8 to 12 megapixels, probably following a very similar reasoning to OnePlus.\nAs OnePlus has previously demonstrated, the new handset appears to deliver much clearer low-light images than those shot with the current iPhone 6. This is due to a combination of the new sensor hardware, internal image processing and the f/2.0 lens fitted to the OnePlus which lets in more light than the iPhone lens (although slightly less light is captured than either the Samsung Galaxy S6 or the LG G4).\nThis low-noise capability is great for night shots or any sort of indoor shooting. Furthermore, the OnePlus 2 is confirmed to feature optical image stabilisation which further improves the quality of low-light shots by reducing camera shake. This allows longer exposures, and therefore more light gathering time for each photo without the need to increase noise-inducing ISO settings.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T20:49:59.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
