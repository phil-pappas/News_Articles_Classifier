The airline also said in a statement that it lowered its highest shuttle prices after the crash \"by nearly 50 percent, to about $300 each way,\" for travel between New York, Boston and Washington. The airline said it honored existing Amtrak tickets for travel between Washington, Boston and New York, waived change fees for travel on Delta Shuttle flights between those markets, and increased seat capacity in the region by adding flights and operating larger aircraft. \nAmerican said it added capacity and its fare structure remained the same after the crash. United, JetBlue and Southwest said they are cooperating with the investigation. \nAmtrak services between Philadelphia and New York were shut down for five days following the accident. That affected passengers traveling through that region. For example, passengers couldn't travel from Washington to Boston or New York, or from Boston to Philadelphia or Baltimore. Full service resumed on May 18. \nAmtrak service accounted for 78 percent of the air-rail market between New York and Washington and 69 percent between New York and Boston last year, according to the railroad. \nSeparately, the Justice Department announced earlier this month that it is investigating possible collusion among major airlines nationwide to limit available seats, which keeps airfares high. The civil antitrust investigation by the Justice Department appears to focus on whether airlines illegally signaled to each other how quickly they would add new flights, routes and extra seats. American, Delta, Southwest and United — the nation's four largest airlines — have acknowledged receiving letters from the Justice Department related to that investigation. \nEight people were killed and about 200 were injured in the Amtrak crash in Philadelphia, temporarily disrupting service. \nFor reasons still unknown, the train accelerated to 106 miles per hour in the minute before it entered a curve where the speed limit is 50, investigators have said previously. In the last few seconds the brakes were applied with maximum force, but the train was still traveling at over 100 mph when it left the tracks. \nAssociated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T22:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T23:11:50.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
