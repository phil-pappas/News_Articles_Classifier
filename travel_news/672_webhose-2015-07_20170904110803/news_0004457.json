The popular National Trail stretches for more than 100 miles, from Chipping Campden in the north to the city of Bath in the south.\nMost of the trail runs along the stunning Cotswold escarpment, passing through numerous pretty villages and close to a number of historic sites.\nIf you’re feeling less energetic, hire a bike to explore the country lanes or enjoy a stroll around Chipping Campden and take in its many historic buildings. Don’t miss the monthly Campden Market in the Town Hall, where you’ll find a wealth of handmade crafts, gifts, cakes, clothes and more.\nChipping Campden also has a great choice of visitor attractions right on its doorstep, including the National Trust’s Snowshill Manor, with its Arts and Crafts-style hillside garden; the steam railway at Toddington; and Batsford Arboretum and Falconry.\nCheck out the tallest gravity fountain in the world at Stanway House or follow in the footsteps of kings and queens at romantic Sudeley Castle. For animal and bird-lovers there’s the Cotswold Farm Park at Guiting Power, the Domestic Fowl Trust at Honeybourne, the Cotswold Wildlife Park just outside Burford, and Birdland at Bourton-on-the-Water.\nStraford-upon-Avon, the birthplace of Shakespeare, is just a few miles away, as are Warwick Castle, Compton Verney (Warwickshire’s largest art gallery) and some of the finest gardens in England.\nThe Kings Hotel combines traditional character with contemporary style to create a relaxed and welcoming home away from home. This lovely boutique hotel boasts 14 bedrooms along with five cottage rooms set apart from the main house, complete with beautiful furnishings and lavish bathrooms.\nRelated Posts Lisa Lewis Joins Associated Luxury Hotels As National Sales Manager In The U.S. West Region Jason Pomeranc, hotelier announces launch of new brand of hotel Sixty Hotels 40% reduction in room rates in Grand Hyatt Taipei in July and August Preferred Hotel Gruop Announces 2013 Results Express your love this Valentine’s Day at Calabash Cove Resort & Spa", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T10:03:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
