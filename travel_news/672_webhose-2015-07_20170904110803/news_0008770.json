The hotel will operate under a management agreement with Financière Immobilière Bordelaise. Opening later this year, the hotel will be IHG’s sixth InterContinental® Hotels & Resorts property in France, cementing its position as the largest luxury hotel brand in Europe. InterContinental Bordeaux - Le Grand will join InterContinental® Paris - Le Grand, InterContinental® Paris - Avenue Marceau, InterContinental® Marseille - Hotel Dieu, InterContinental® Carlton Cannes, and most recently InterContinental® Lyon - Hotel Dieu. \nThe hotel occupies a prime location on Place de la Comédie, Bordeaux’s central square. The hotel is surrounded by the finest shops and restaurants in the heart of Bordeaux, a city that was recently voted Europe’s top destination to visit for 2015 by European Best Destinations. The historic 130-room property, which dates back to 1776, will be converted from the current Grand Hôtel de Bordeaux & Spa over the coming months. The hotel’s food and beverage offering will be overseen by the Gordon Ramsay Group as it makes its first foray into Bordeaux and will include the fine dining restaurant - Le Pressoir D’Argent, serving only the finest seasonal ingredients from the terroir of Bordeaux, along with expertly matched wines from the region. In addition, seven meeting rooms, an indoor pool (the Bain de Léa) as well as fitness, spa and hammam facilities will be available. Offering a range of luxurious rooms and suites, the hotel is well equipped to meet the needs of both business and leisure guests travelling to the city. Philippe Bijaoui, Vice President of Development, Europe, IHG said: “InterContinental® Bordeaux - Le Grand Hotel will offer guests a luxury hotel stay in a sought-after location. This iconic brand is going from strength to strength in France and this new hotel will further enhance the momentum behind the brand’s growth in Europe. We’re delighted to be working with Financière Immobilière Bordelaise on this unique property and look forward to expanding our partnership.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T14:14:54.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
