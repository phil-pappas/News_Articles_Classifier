Mesmerising footage captures ghostly waterfall made entirely... Wading for take off! Siberian weather extremes strike at... Don’t let the Tube strike derail your mood… The London hotel... The booking had been made by someone within the Education, Sport and Culture department, a spokesman said, adding it was 'human error'.\nMr Pallett, assistant minister of both the Economic Development and Planning and Environment departments, said the department should have been more careful when the flight was booked.\nPallet was due to receive a flag from the Romanian hosts of the Dance World Cup event in Bucharest (above)\n'It is really disappointing, I have to apologise for wasting taxpayers' money and for letting down the Dance World Cup,' he said.\n'I don't know the exact cost as I've still got some figures to come back, but it won't be less than £1,000. All I can do is apologise for what is a schoolboy error, the last thing I needed was a day trip to Budapest after a long week supporting the Island Games.'\nHe was supposed to make a speech and accept the flag on behalf of nearly 3,000 competitors from 32 countries, including England, Northern Ireland and Wales.\nHe had been heavily involved in the Island Games, a multi-sport competition similar to the Olympics, that was being held in Jersey the week before.\nThe Dance World Cup will be held in Jersey in 2016 but Mr Pallett missed the flag handover\nIt's not the first time a geographical mix up has caused embarrassment.\nEarlier this year a medical student attempted to fly to Guyana to begin his scholarship but ended up nearly 2,000 miles away in the Brazilian city of Goiania.\nIn 2013 Lamenda Kingdon, a British woman, had planned a visit to the Alhambra Palace in Granada, Spain. Instead she mistakenly caught a flight across the Atlantic to the tropical Caribbean island of Grenada.\nAlso in 2013 Sandy Valdiviseo and her husband Triet Vo were intending to fly from Los Angeles to Dakar in Senegal with Turkish Airlines. However, instead they ended up almost 7,000 miles away – on an entirely different continent – in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, after the airport codes were mixed up.\nThe stories were widely reported across all media, leaving both travellers and booking companies more than a little red-faced.\nRead more: Budapest/Bucharest mix up for Jersey politician - BBC News Booking blunder sends sports minister to wrong country - Telegraph", "external_links": ["http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/11725701/Booking-blunder-sends-sports-minister-to-wrong-country.html", "http://dailym.ai/1HMXIgs", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-33387201"], "published": "2015-07-08T23:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T21:03:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
