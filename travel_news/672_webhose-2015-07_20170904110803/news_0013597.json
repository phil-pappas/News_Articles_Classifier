Rap, hip hop, opera, garage, classical , folk, pop, musicals and jazz all have their champions – and their audiences – but dear old operetta seems to have slipped away unnoticed into the history books, seldom if ever to be hauled out for an airing. The reasons are easy to discover. Opera fans, for instance, will spurn operetta as being a touch too lowbrow. They prefer their works to be “sung through”, rather than having the characters lapsing into dialogue to carry the plot forward. • A Noel Coward treasure trove They do have a point, since operetta belongs to the 19th and early 20th centuries, and many of the “books” (the name given to operetta dialogue) don’t so much creak nowadays as fall to pieces. The plots, too, tend to be cheesy and predictable (although the same could be said of opera and modern musicals). The bottom line is that operetta is unfashionably dated, and audiences would find the likes of Franz Lehar’s Count of Luxembourg and Kismet tiresome – and maybe even laughable – to sit through. So why should I fight their corner? For one simple reason – good tunes. If we lose operetta, we lose a raft of melodies that tug at the heart strings every bit as effectively as the songs in modern musicals, often with far better orchestration and style. Comic genius: some of Noël Coward’s humorous songs are still popular today (Rex) As well as promoting Lehar’s The Merry Widow, which is perhaps the only operetta whose music is heard with any frequency, I include the musicals of Lionel Monckton – The Arcadians and The Quaker Girl – Noël Coward’s Bitter Sweet and the compositions of the king of the British musical in those days, Ivor Novello. Aside from a BBC prom devoted to his music in 2012, and the inclusion of Novello as a character in Julian Fellowes’s screenplay for Gosford Park, Novello and his music have slipped off the radar. There are annual music awards that bear his name, but I bet that few of the recipients know much about the man or the melodies he composed. • The 10 best film musicals of all time • Ivor Novello celebrated Novello was born into a musical family – his mother, Clara Novello Davies, was a Welsh singing teacher – and Novello’s own talent was discovered early. His first big hit, Keep the Home Fires Burning, became a national anthem during the First World War. He went on to write and star in a clutch of stage musicals: King’s Rhapsody, Glamorous Night, Careless Rapture and The Dancing Years. Ivor Novello with Henry Hall and Vanessa Lee during rehearsals for King's Rhapsody (Rex) I know the titles seem syrupy now (and I doubt that we will ever again see a production of Gay’s the Word), but spare a moment to listen, at least, to his overtures; if you are a fan of light classical music you will love them. There is also matchless lyrical beauty in his songs, such as Some Day My Heart Will Awake and Glamorous Night. • Noel Coward's best Quote: s Noël Coward, too, though celebrated more for his plays nowadays, was an accomplished tunesmith. His comic songs such as The Stately Homes of England and Mad Dogs and Englishmen occasionally receive an airing, but listen to I’ll See You Again and If Love Were All, and tell me if your heart does not melt a little. • The house that inspired Noel Coward I will continue my crusade – including the music of these forgotten masters in my Saturday morning programme on Classic FM – and see if I can help to keep their melodies alive. The way we use words may become dated over the years, but a good tune should last forever.
