Hotels - Airlines - CVBs - Destinations - people State of Emergency in Tunisia, while protecting tourists is a high priority Adv: \nJul 04, 2015 Adv: \nMore soldiers and more police are at Tunisia's empty beaches. Occupancy is down to 10% in many hotels. Restaurants are deserted. \nThe word is, Tunisia has never been so safe for tourists, even though the president Beji Caid Essebsi in a nationwide televised address, officially reintroduced urgent security measures for the North African country that had been lifted in March 2014. He declared a state of emergency today on saying not referring to tourists, the country is \"not safe\" and risks collapse from further extremist attacks. \nThe Government pledges to protect all tourists. This is highly visible in tourism centers, on Tunisia's beaches and hotels, but this may be too late of a good arrangement at this time. \nThe declaration comes slightly more than a week after 38 people were killed in an attack at the resort town of Sousse. \nTunisia's emergency law temporarily gives the government more executive flexibility, hands the army and police more authority and restricts certain rights such as the right to public assembly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T00:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T02:22:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
