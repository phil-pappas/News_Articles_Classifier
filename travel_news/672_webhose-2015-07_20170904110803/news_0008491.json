The value proposition is unarguably a compelling one. \nThe question with PointBreaks, always, is whether any of the discounted hotels work for you. As far as sheer numbers go, the current list features around the same number of participating properties as the previous quarter's. But that's a substantial downgrade from the roster of several quarters ago, which featured 210 hotels, including 142 in the U.S. alone. There's only one InterContinental on the new list, the Intercontinental Mendoza in Argentina. \nBottom line: Whether it's long or short, the PointBreaks list is always worth perusing. There just might be a hotel that fits into your existing travel plans, or that could be the centerpiece of an opportunistic trip. \nAs always, room nights available at the PointBreaks rate are limited, so act quickly to lock in a deal that works for you. \nReader Reality Check \nHave you ever booked a PointBreaks stay? \nYou Might Also Like:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T23:27:36.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
