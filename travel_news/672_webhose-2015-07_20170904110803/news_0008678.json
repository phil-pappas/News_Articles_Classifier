Seattle Times jazz critic Concert review \nIt’s a testament to the power of Brazilian vocalist Maucha Adnet, who opened the Jazz Port Townsend concerts in McCurdy Pavilion on Friday (July 24), that she sang her entire set in Portuguese but the crowd still gave her a standing ovation. \nAdnet’s performance was one of several at the festival with a world music flavor, including programs by Trio Da Paz (led by Adnet’s husband, Duduka Da Fonseca) and by violinist Regina Carter, who ranged all over the atlas. \nAdnet sang Friday like Cezanne painted — in purples and oranges that surprised you with their blunt, unarguable honesty and quiet, organizational grace, often doing tunes unfamiliar to the crowd — Vinicius de Moraes’ “Pra Que Chorar,” Gilbert Gil’s “Eu Vim da Bahia” — yet still communicating. \nCarter, who followed, delighted the audience with Richard Bona’s African-inspired “Mandingo Street,” on which she sang as she bowed. Before soaring into the beautiful spiritual “I’m Going Home On This Morning’s Train,” Carter dialed up a field recording of the song on her mobile device.

Nazarian did him one better by bringing her actual family on stage, including her husband, Jay Ashby, playing trombone, and her son, Ian, singing the lead on the ‘50s hit, “Qué Será, Será,” a song the elderly crowd happily chimed in on. \nTenor saxophonist Bob Mintzer closed the afternoon by conducting a set of his arrangements played by the Faculty All-Star Big Band, which included some warm brass writing on a quiet, Native American-inspired tune, “Original People.” Paul de Barros: 206-464-3247; pdebarros@seattletimes.com ; or follow him on Twitter @pdebarros", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T23:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T23:49:10.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
