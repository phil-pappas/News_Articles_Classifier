It was an industry event and it went ahead in the end, but about 200 of the 900 delegates dropped out. \n\"But it is clear that the situation has improved and there have been no new cases for quite a long time now, so we believe the worst is over.\" \nWoo-tak Suh, a spokesman for the Grand InterContinental Seoul Parnas which sits in the heart of the city and close to COEX convention and exhibition centre, agreed that the outbreak appears to have run its course. \n\"MERS did have an effect on our business, but it was limited,\" he said. \"And we understand from the government that things are improving. We look forward to our guests returning very soon.\" \nWhile no official numbers are available on the impact of MERS on South Korea's MICE sector, the Korea Tourism Organisation reported that June arrivals had plummeted 41 per cent dip, with numbers standing at 750,925, down from 1.27 million a year ago. \nTaiwan footfalls tumbled 75.7 per cent, arrivals from Hong Kong shrank 74.6 per cent, and Singapore numbers fell by more than 62 per cent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T11:12:05.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
