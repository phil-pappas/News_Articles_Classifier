It was next to the wheels,” he says pointing to the camper they are touring in.\nAnna, a photographer, says: “We have been travelling around NSW and Victoria for three months.\n“Now we have been in Sydney for one-and-a-half months. At first we were in a tent but it was just too difficult to travel with kids in a tent so we bought a second-hand camper. It’s much easier.”\nShe and husband Ivo, an IT worker, are among a steady stream of tourists, backpackers and locals discovering that winter camping really is possible in NSW given our gorgeous sunny winter days — and a portable heater.\n“With kids we really need a heater,” Alvarez says.\n“This park is beautiful. It’s amazing, it’s so near to the city. Every day we go for a walk here.”\nAnd the kids love exploring the park.\n“They think it is amazing, they like it here.”\nHer only concern is that it’s about the only campground close to the centre of Sydney.\n“There is not so much to choose from in Sydney. There are no other possibilities. I couldn’t find another one.”\nThe family has stayed at campgrounds at Bega, Tathra, along the Murray River and in the outback around Broken Hill.\nYannick Gouri and Sarah Williams at Lane Cove River Tourist Park.

Source: News Corp Australia\nLane Cove River Tourist Park spokesman Yannick Gourvil says sunny, dry days, site availability and quieter campsites make winter camping viable.\n“July is the driest month of the year,” he says. “The park is less crowded now, you don’t have people and kids running around as you would in summer.”\nThat also means more chance to stay in the park’s secluded $200 a night Tandara site — a luxury motel room masquerading as a permanently erected tent complete with its own bathroom, lighting and cooking facilities — that has recently been given a facelift.\nGourvil says: “We find that as you get into the three months of June, July and August it does really drop off. We don’t get the same level of bookings.”\nBut, he says, many people stay in the park in winter.\n“You get a lot of overseas backpackers. And the grey nomads, the people travelling around Australia, are popping in here because it is the closest one to Sydney.”\nThere are other campgrounds and caravan parks in Sydney at Mascot, Dural, Narrabeen and The Basin (on the Hawkesbury River) and hundreds spread around the state suitable for winter escapes where campfires, cosy sleeping bags and a hot cuppa from a\nboiling billy will cast off the winter blues.\nNSW Caravan and Camping Industry Association CEO Lyndel Gray says camping is a year-round experience but with cabins, pre-erected tents and on-site vans at many parks, it is within most families’ reach in winter.\n“You’ve got less people, the parks are less crowded in winter. There are also great deals going this time of year,” she says. “The outback is great, the climate is good this time of year. On the north and south coasts the whales are migrating, you might even see one.\n“The weather is not a deterrent. You can have crisp, cool mornings but bright blue sunny days; it’s great this time of year.\nNothing beats a campfire in winter. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\n“There are many places you can have a fire, get rugged up, sit around a fireplace.\n“A lot of our parks are right on the beachfront and up close to national parks.”\nGray says some parks offer winter deals that allow kids to stay for free.\n“I think camping is something that every kid should experience. I just think that those experiences are priceless. I encourage families to give it a go. These days the equipment is so good you’ve got all the comforts of home anyway.”\nShe says camping offers experiences most kids will never get inside their home or even in their backyard.\n“Smelling nature, waking up to the sounds of the bush or at the beach waking up and hearing the waves.\n“Seeing the wildlife, seeing kangaroos,” she says.\nThere is also the experience of marshmallows toasted on an open fire. “I think bacon and eggs toasted on the barbecue is pretty hard to beat.”\nGray says the new friendships that are forged when families make friends in the campground environment are some of the best.\nBut what are the risks of children being injured by being over-adventurous in the bush?\n“Kids will be kids, but it is an environment that’s safe to an extent,” she says.\nFollow David Fitzsimons on Twitter: @FitzAtLarge\nPACK YOUR SWAG\nGreat places to stay for year-round camping throughout the state\nCITY\n● Lane Cove River Tourist Park, Plassey Rd, North Ryde; nationalparks.nsw.gov.au\nCamp in a secluded bush setting minutes from a railway station and only 12km from the CBD.
