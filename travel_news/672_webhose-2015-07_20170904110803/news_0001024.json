Thomas Cook has already agreed pledged to raise an initial £1 million for the initiative and has also drafted in the former boss of supermarket Sainsbury’s to review customer health, safety, welfare, relations and crisis management at the firm. \n“The powers that be, whether in the government and at Thomas Cook, should be in no doubt that I intend to use whatever power this place gives us to campaign for justice for Christi and Bobby and their parents. Theirs is a cause that cries out for change, for attention and for justice. We must see that they get it,” Creagh said in parliament. \nCrouch paid tribute to Creagh and said she hoped the tragic incident would make travel companies “reflect on the lessons learned and to be ever vigilant.” \nMeanwhile, Creagh also used the debate to once again attack the behaviour of successive Thomas Cook bosses over the years. \n“I saw the parents hear, during the inquest, how and why their children had died. They had to sit as the former chief executive of Thomas Cook, Manny Fontenla-Novoa, declined to answer the questions from their barrister; and they gasped, along with the whole country, when the current chief executive of Thomas Cook, Peter Fankhauser, said that Thomas Cook had ‘no need to apologise’,” she said. \nShe also criticised Harriet Green. \n“If Ms Green’s lawyers ever find the letter which she alleges she wrote to the parents and which they say they never received, I am sure that they and we would be very glad to see it,” \nCreagh, however, did say that she was now looking forward to working with the company on the new initiative.

What is needed is government pressure on the EU Commission to start the process of developing an EU Directive on Hotel Safety. Considering it will be 8 years from the start of the review of the Package Travel Directive to the date of implementation, the work on hotel safety needs to start now. In the meantime we need to make consumers aware of the issues to look out for because the risk of poisoning, fire or drowning in the pool are real", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T13:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T12:32:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
