First of all, you should ask yourself some basic questions: what type of accommodation do I want? Is there any possibility of getting a room on campus? How much can I afford? Do I want to live with students from the same university? Am I happy to live with working professionals? Identify your situation in one of our categories, and you'll find advice that will reveal the fastest way to your future home A. I was offered a place in Clearing and want to live in university halls. B. I want (and can afford) to live in private student accommodation … C. ... and I’m a University of London student. D. I want to share a flat/house with other students. E. I want to contact a letting agent directly. F. I need help and advice to find on/off-campus accommodation. A. I got an offer through Clearing or Adjustment and want to live on campus If you wish to stay in your university's halls, the first thing to do is ascertain whether you are still eligible to apply for a room. Generally, universities set a deadline for accommodation of around the 30th of June. But if you think that it's now to late to apply, guess what? It's not. The majority of universities allow their future students who get an offer through Clearing or Adjustment to apply for a room. However, very few will make guarantees. You will, generally, be put on a waiting list, and distribution is dealt on a first come, first served basis. Hence, the sooner you apply, the higher your chances of securing a room at your student halls. Acting fast is key. Your luck will depend on several criteria such as the number of applicants and whether you live outside the M25, which would give you priority. However, instead of losing time calculating your probability of getting a room, it might be wiser to consider what other options are available to you, just in case you don't get a place. Here's the list of universities that accept late applications from students who get an offer through Clearing or Adjustment: AA School of Architecture* Brunel University London: (deadline: apply before 1 September!) City University London Goldsmiths King’s College London London Metropolitan University* London South Bank University Middlesex University Queen Mary, University of London Ravensbourne* Regent's University* Royal Veterinary College SOAS St George's Medical School University of the Arts London (UAL) University of East London University of Greenwich University of Roehampton University of West London University of Westminster Colleges noted with a (*) do not have their own halls and allocate their students private halls. If your university is not listed above, it might be time to consider private housing. Don't worry, you have plenty of options, keep calm and have a look at our next sections. B. I want (and can afford) to live in private student accommodation Private student accommodation has been flourishing in recent years and can be found in almost any part of London. However, while rooms may be well located and luxurious, they tend to be expensive, with the cheapest usually starting at £200 per week (pw). If the word 'expensive' isn't part of your vocabulary, you might find the following websites pretty useful: AXO From £200pw (Kentish Town, Islington and Westminster). CRM From £150pw (Finsbury Park, Aldgate, Wembley, South Bank, Barbican, Hammersmith, Fulham). iQ Student Accommodation From £240pw (Shoreditch, Hoxton, Bloomsbury, Kingston). UNITE is good if your main concern is to be near to your campus. It displays rooms located near 10 of London’s universities, such as UAL, City, East London, Richmond and Westminster. Prices start at £170pw. Mansion Student From £180pw. The website is designed to find rooms depending on your tenancy length preferences. Pure Student Living From £280pw (Hammersmith, Aldgate, Highbury, the City and Bankside). Student Housing Company From £240pw (King’s Cross, Aldgate East). Urbanest From £259pw (Hoxton, King’s Cross, Tower Bridge, Westminster, and St Pancras). C. I’m a University of London student The University of London offers two services reserved to its students: University of London Student Homes works in partnership with trusted private landlords to provide good quality housing for students. University of London Housing Services assists students from the University of London to find a room, flat or house across London. There's been a rise in luxury accommodation, like the Stay Club, Regent's Park D. I want to share a flat or house with other students (possibly at different universities) If you want to find potential flatmates, whether they're going to the same university as you or not, connecting via social media can be one way to go about it. Join the relevant accommodation groups on Facebook. A lot of them increase in size over the summer and will allow you to meet your future classmates. Other websites, such as The Student Room, also feature sections dedicated to helping students find flat mates in London . Housing workshops are regularly organised around London's colleges. A Flatmate Finder event runs every year (10-11 September) on campuses that are part of the University of London. The goal is to match students into groups so that they can start house hunting together. Don’t forget to choose housemates whose budgets are roughly similar to yours in order to avoid any hurdles when deciding on a property. Here are some useful websites to find flat shares across London: Easy Roommate Accommodation for Students StuRents Pads for Students Rightmove Students Spareroom Student Block If you’re looking for a flat or a studio, Zoopla and Rightmove are very practical and easy to use. E. I want to contact a letting agent directly Finally, if you’re looking for an agent, here are some websites designed to find one. Your search will be based according to your area of preference: Association of Residential Letting Agents National Approved Letting Scheme National Association of Estate Agents F. I need help and advice to find on/off-campus accommodation Universities always have a student accommodation team who will give you free advice and help, whether you are looking for a place in their halls of residence, or private accommodation off campus. You’ll find plenty of information by browsing your university’s website or by calling the accommodation office directly on their helpline. They will give you all the fundamental information you need before flat hunting in London. If you’re already in the city, it might be a good idea to visit the team office in person to make the most out of their services. Most universities will provide you with recommended private landlord lists and private housing websites.
