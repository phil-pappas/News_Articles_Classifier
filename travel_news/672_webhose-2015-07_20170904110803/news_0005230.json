Mahan Terry Slaybaugh criticized Milwaukee County officials after returning to Dayton. Terry Slaybaugh , who endured a two-month layover as executive director of Milwaukee County’s General Mitchell International Airport , took a few shots at his former bosses and their management style, after he returned to the comfort of his job and family in Dayton, Ohio. Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele responded Tuesday with subtle digs, while County Board chairwoman Marina Dimitrijevic unleashed a barrage — at Abele. “(Abele)’s not a good manager,” she said. “Nobody wants to work for him.” Dimitrijevic said Abele constantly attacks the County Board, seeks to expand his power through the Wisconsin Legislature in Madison and creates a revolving door of managers because of his “obsessive management of department heads.” “It’s tough to work in county government right now,” she said. And what did Slaybaugh say to set off the dogfight? “Up there (Milwaukee), they had a board of supervisors that are at each others’ throats. It was a completely different political environment.” The 59-year-old Slaybaugh, who worked as director of Dayton’s city-owned airport for four years, took the Milwaukee job in early 2015. He left behind an airport that serves 1.1 million passengers a year to lead one that serves 6.5 million with four major airlines, and a starting salary of $168,000. He made the move knowing it would be a challenge for his family of eight children — seven still live at home — and he cited family reasons when he announced his resignation from the Milwaukee job in April. At the time, Slaybaugh’s bosses accepted his explanation, and Abele mentioned no performance issues or conflicts. Brian Dranzik, the county’s transportation director and Slaybaugh’s immediate supervisor, said the short-timer never mentioned any of the complaints he shared last week with the Dayton Business Journal. In an interview at the Dayton airport, Slaybaugh said he was “heavily managed by his bosses” in Milwaukee and pushed to implement ideas that he didn’t think would work. Abele responded in an email: “We all wish Terry Slaybaugh the best as he continues to reintegrate back to Dayton. I certainly understand that the scale of Milwaukee brings unique challenges that may not be present in Dayton, Ohio. Milwaukee is accustomed to high standards, the embracing of a culture of continuous improvement, and a full commitment to the job of meeting and exceeding the high standard set by my Milwaukee County and the GMIA staff.” \nWant Milwaukee Travel  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T23:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T00:31:09.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
