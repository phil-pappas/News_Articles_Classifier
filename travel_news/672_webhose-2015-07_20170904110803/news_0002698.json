After walking down a slight slope, the museum is revealed to resemble a partially underground kiln. Founded in 2000 and opened to the public in 2005, the museum is home to over 16,000 ancient ceramics donated by university founder Surat Osathanugrah. About 2,000 of these items are on view at the current exhibition. \nAfter strolling past the model of a northern-style cross-draft kiln and showing our Muse Pass, we entered the museum that has just reopened after the post-flood renovations. The permanent exhibition highlights the development of Southeast Asian ceramics, especially those from major kiln sites in Thailand, as well as the history of Thai and other Southeast Asian trade ceramics based on evidence found at shipwreck sites in this region. \nThe display of different ceramics on the sand caught our eyes. The first space reflects that pottery found at archaeological sites dating from 1380-1430 had been from all across Southeast Asia, including Thailand (Si Satchanalai, Sukhothai and San Kamphaeng kiln sites), Vietnam and China. At the time, the Chinese traded ceramics of celadon and brown-glazed wares, but there was no blue and white wares at all. \nThe second space shows trade ceramics from Thailand, Vietnam, China and Myanmar, which date back to 1488-1505 and were commonly found on shipwrecks. The third space displays artefacts from a period of competition between Thai and Chinese ceramics from 1520-1560. Thai kilns in Sukhothai and Si Satchanalai produced large numbers of underglaze black ware, a competitor to the Chinese blue and white ware. \nThe next part of the exhibition shows and categorises ceramics according to production methods, materials and shapes. The word \"ceramics\" refers to all objects made from fired clay. Ceramics can be classified into three major kinds — earthenware, stoneware and porcelain. Earthenware usually dates to prehistoric times. It was fired without the use of kilns at a temperature of about 850-1,150C. Stoneware is made from clay with less impurities than earthenware and kiln-fired at about 1,150-1,300C. Most Southeast Asian glazed pottery is stoneware. Porcelain is made from pure clay without impurities and kiln-fired at 1,300-1,450C. It is translucent, white and normally thin. Also, ceramics are mainly divided into monochrome, celadon and underglaze wares. \nThe main collection focuses on ancient ceramics, most of which were made at kilns in Thailand as well as those from China, Vietnam and Myanmar, which were imported by Thailand in ancient times. \nThere is pottery from about 2500 BC, such as pots from Ban Chiang, Udon Thani and Thai trade ceramics from the 14th-16th centuries. There is a range of pottery from central Thailand and Khmer ceramics from the Phnom Dangrek kilns in Thailand around 1050-1125 and the Phnom Kulen kilns in Cambodia as early as the 9th century. On view here are ash-glazed, brown-glazed and two-colour glazed wares from the Phnom Dongrek kilns in Buri Ram province. \nWe saw samples of ceramics from numerous kiln sites in the north of Thailand, including green-glazed and brown-glazed wares from the Kalong kiln complex in Chiang Rai. A highlight is the display of ceramics from the famous Si Satchanalai kiln site in Sukhothai which exported its pottery to overseas markets from 1380-1580. They are shown chronologically, ranging from green-glazed and brown-glazed monochrome wares in the late 14th century to celadon from 1420-1520 and underglaze black ware for export during 1560-1584. \nAlso on view are ceramics from the Sukhothai kiln site dating to the 15th-16th centuries. The debris of waste mainly represents dishes decorated with a painted fish design. There is no evidence for celadon production. \nAfter that, we looked at Thai trade ceramics for six periods of time from 1368 to 1580 starting from unglazed and brown-glazed wares to Si Satchanalai figurines. \nAfter touching selected Thai and foreign ceramics at the Hand Holes: Ceramics For Touching corner, we saw a number of masterpieces. For example, a celadon figurine of a war elephant manned by a mahout with a warrior at each leg was produced by the Si Satchanalai kiln in the early 16th century. Also from the same kiln is a two-colour glazed jar with a cover and a two-colour glazed gable finial depicting a thepphanom (a Thai angel with palms joined in reverence). A Khmer green-glazed jar in the shape of an elephant with very fine details about a ritual is from the Ban Kruat kiln site in Buri Ram in the 12th-13th century. An underglaze black bowl from the Kalong kiln in the 15th century is also on view. \nInterestingly, this museum houses the largest accessible collection of ceramics from the Tak-Om Koi burial sites, including Yuan Dynasty Chinese blue and white wares which were exported from 1327-1352. Also on view here are some of the Ming Dynasty Chinese blue and white wares (around 1460) from the Royal Nanhai shipwreck that carried 21,000 pieces of Thai celadon and was discovered off the eastern coast of Malaysia in 1995. Certain firing techniques and shapes inspired by Chinese ceramics were applied in some of the Thai ceramics. \nArtefacts contained in the masterpiece corner. \nThe Southeast Asian Ceramics Museum. \nOne of the masterpieces – an elephant-shaped celadon figurine.
