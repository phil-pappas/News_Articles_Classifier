So I'm following the seat61 guide on how to register for Cleartrip in order to book trains in India. After sending an email to IRCTC to get my sms code sent to me by email, they replied with:\"Please send us the following profile details: Name, Residential address, Office address, Date of birth, Registered mobile number to check the authenticity of the mail.\" The seat 61 guide does not mention this part. It just says to email a request with my passport photo and IRCTC user name and that they would reply with my sms code to complete the cleartrip verification. So how do I proceed? Do I provide my real address? I don't even remember the fake phone number I provided at sign up. Would I give them the fake number? Any help with this step would be appreciated.
