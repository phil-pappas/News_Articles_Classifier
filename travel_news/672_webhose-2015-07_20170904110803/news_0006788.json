This new supply-chain initiative under Flipkart’s alternate delivery model will allow customers to walk into their nearest ‘experience zone’ and collect their shipments at their convenient time.\nWhat drove Flipkart to offer this service includes unavailability of customers during delivery and restricted entry of delivery boys into IT parks, gated communities and educational institutions – these reasons led to customer dissatisfaction with the delivery process, hurting sales.\nNeeraj Aggarwal, Sr. Director – Delivery Operations, Flipkart, said “Getting logistics right is extremely crucial for e-commerce companies. Our efforts are focused on expanding our delivery network, without compromising on the customer service levels and expectation. We believe this model is a resolution to customer unavailability issues, as it offers consumers a choice to adjust the delivery time & location according to their convenience. It also provides a solution to restrictions for e-commerce entry into tech parks/ gated communities/ universities.”\nThis service has been launched in conjuction with Flipkart’s logistics partner. The pilot project had received an overwhelming response from customers with more than 80% of shipments picked up through the stores, over a period of 6 months.\nNeeraj added, “We also plan to offer several value added services at these experience zones to enhance customer engagement. Services like instant returns, spot trials, open box deliveries and exclusive product demos will also be rolled-out in the near future. Post the successful launch of the first phase, we plan to ramp up to 100 experience zones by March 2016.”\n 28, 2015 11:32 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T12:26:02.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
