Watch Wimbledon on a big screen Haven’t got tickets and can’t face The Queue? Dozens of outdoor screens have been set up for those wanting to watch Wimbledon in the sunshine, including those at Lewis Cubitt Square, The Scoop at More London and One New Change in the capital, Media City in Salford, Millennium Square in Leeds, Tennis Plaza in Liverpool and Cabot Circus in Bristol. See our guide for more options . 3. Admire an icon New at the National Portrait Gallery is Audrey Hepburn: Portraits of an Icon , featuring an extraordinary array of both lesser-known and famous images. “The Belgian-born, British-American film star’s period of posthumous, second-time-around fame probably peaked some time ago,” says The Telegraph’s Mark Hudson. “Not that you’d know that from this exhibition, which looks set to trigger a whole new wave of Audrey-mania.” • London's best outdoor pools • London's best rooftop bars 4. See Damon Albarn's new musical in Manchester The Manchester International Festival began on Thursday, showcasing dance, theatre and musical performances from both established and underground artists and acts.

Give the QM2 a send-off in Liverpool On Saturday, exactly 175 years after Cunard’s first transatlantic sailing, the cruise line will be hosting a knees-up in Liverpool. There will be two concerts at the city’s Anglican Cathedral, featuring performances from the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, along with talks on the company’s heritage by the likes of Lord Prescott, Carol Thatcher and Michael Buerk. The Queen Mary 2 liner then departs for a voyage to Halifax, Nova Scotia – a recreation of the first crossing and the first Cunard departure from Liverpool since 1968. • 175 years of Cunard 6. Sup Pimm’s at the Henley Regatta “The ultimate Edwardian-style season event on the Thames, with some rowing,” is how Telegraph Travel’s Sophie Campbell describes this annual riverside jolly. “The Henley Royal Regatta is the most identifiably Edwardian of the season events, and takes place on both banks of the river in Henley-on-Thames,” she adds. “It features knockout races, two boats at a time, with sometimes more than 90 races a day. The men get much of the sartorial attention: oarsmen past and present sport dazzling blazers, outrageous socks and club ties.” See our complete guide to more information .

Head to the seaside A poll by Travelodge has suggested that British children are clueless when it comes to locating famous British seaside resorts on a map, with many thinking Newquay is in America and Skegness in the Scottish Highlands. Even their parents would have trouble locating Telegraph Travel’s 20 favourite secret beaches .

See the new Serpentine Pavilion The annual unveiling of the Serpentine’s temporary pavilion is another welcome sign that the London summer season is fully up and running. This time Spanish architects José Selgas and Lucía Cano are the team behind the design - an effervescent, candy-coloured tunnel - that drew inspiration from an unlikely source: the London Underground. Speaking to the Telegraph about their intentions, the designers said: “We like the way the Underground brings everyone together…We wanted to bring that feeling here, so we’ve created a very open space with lots of entry points and it’s up to you to find your corner.” You can learn more about their intentions, and see the pavilion for yourself, in our video .

Gawp at Channing Tatum – or remember Amy Winehouse This week’s two big cinema releases are Magic Mike XXL , featuring Channing Tatum as a male stripper, and Amy , a documentary about the singer Amy Winehouse’s rise and tragic fall. The Telegraph’s Tim Robey describes the former as “sexier, funnier and soapier than the original” and “the gayest straight film ever made”. The latter is a “piercingly sad” film, says Robbie Collin, that will “make you newly angry about losing Winehouse so early – before albums three, four, five and more, before the lifetime achievement awards and glittering retrospectives.” • Britain's best outdoor cinemas 14. Have a BBQ The Telegraph has been hard at work coming up with simple yet innovative recipe ideas to liven up your summer barbecue.
