The amount of visitors coming to the country is expected to be at least equivalent to that of summer 2014. However, the data also show that more and more French travelers explore their homeland. \nAccording to the 1st wave of a cyclical survey conducted by the Tourism Offices of France, Rn2D, ANMSM and Atout France, the number of French tourists traveling around their home country is expected to grow during the summer of 2015, as well as the number of foreign visitors. \nThe survey reported a \"good general dynamic\" for the start of the season between April 15 and June 15, 2015. It is \"particularly characterized by the French clientele\". \nThe tourist numbers are generally higher than for the same period in 2014. Especially on Brittany's, Norman’s and Northerner’s coasts and in many provincial cities as well as in the whole of the South-East the services providers report increased amount of bookings. \nThe British remain the most numerous group of international tourists coming to France.
