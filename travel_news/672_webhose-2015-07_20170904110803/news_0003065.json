On Wednesday, the San Francisco-based ride-hailing company announced that it signed an agreement with the Kansas City Aviation Department to pick up passengers at the city’s airport (Code: MCI). Ian Redhead , deputy director for operations and maintenance at the department, said the company will be allowed to pick up passengers at the airport’s terminals. In exchange, Uber will pay a $3 fee. Redhead said the fee is assessed to pay for the upkeep of the roads and other infrastructure around the airport’s two operational terminals. In the past, he said, the airlines that fly out of KCI paid the fee. Jim Ready , manager of Kansas City’s Regulated Industries Division, said Uber already had the clearance from the city to pick up and drop off passengers at the airport. That was granted in the spring , when the city rewrote its for-hire transportation laws. A separate agreement with the Aviation Department was needed to ensure that rides could be hailed at the airport. Uber cars will be allowed to wait for passengers near the airport control tower in the center of the airport complex, where limousines and other livery vehicles wait. Uber was allowed to drop off passengers at the airport before, Redhead said, but was blocked from picking up passengers from the airport’s terminals. \nWant Kansas City Travel   Home of the Day", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T03:02:40.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
