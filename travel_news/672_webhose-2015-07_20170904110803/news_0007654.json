Group underlying profit before tax will now be between £1.33bn and £1.47bn, compared to previous guidance of £1.4bn to £1.55bn, the company said in a statement today. Its marine division, which makes engines for merchant vessels as well as systems for oil rigs, is expected to turn in underlying profit between break even and £40m. Rolls-Royce’s civil aviation division could also take a hit as it phased out its Trent 700 engine in favour of its next-generation Trent 7000, the company said. It also reported lower-than-expected demand for business jet engines. Revenue for 2015 would be unchanged, Rolls-Royce added. The warning comes three days after new chief executive Warren East was installed at the company. Rolls-Royce announced in April that the former boss of chip designer ARM would replace John Rishton after four years at the helm. East said: “I am clearly disappointed by today's announcement and the impact this will have on our investors and employees. \"Notwithstanding the market developments, it is our responsibility to build a business that is sustainable and resilient no matter what is thrown at us and this will be my fundamental priority for the next few years.\" Looking further into the future, Rolls-Royce warned that continuing weakness in offshore markets would lower profit in its marine division by around £85m in both 2015 and 2016. Plans to cut costs and restructure the division would result in an exceptional charge of £70m to £100m, it added. In February, Rolls-Royce reported its first drop in revenues in a decade. Underlying revenue fell 6pc to £14.58bn and underlying profit before tax slid 8pc to £1.62bn.
