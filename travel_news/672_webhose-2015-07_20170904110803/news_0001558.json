Carnival Corp. announced that the U.S. Department of Commerce has been granted approval for the company to begin travel to Cuba. The Miami-based cruise company plans to add a Cuba itinerary to its newly rolled out cruise line, Fathom, which will launch its maiden voyage in April 2016 to the Dominican Republic from PortMiami. Travel to Cuba on Fathom's ship is expected by May 2016.
