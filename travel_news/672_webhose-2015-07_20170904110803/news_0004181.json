Members of the Church’s ruling General Synod are being asked to give final approval to a change in ecclesiastical rules today (Sunday) which would allow children and worshippers who have not been confirmed to administer the sacrament at eucharist services. It comes despite fears from the Church’s most senior liturgical body that children could spill communion wine, which represents the blood of Christ. It would also mean children being invited to distribute alcohol in churches - almost a decade before they could legally drink it in a pub. The change would further widen the gap between Anglican churches and Roman Catholic tradition in which communion wine is held in special reverence, believed to be the actual blood of Christ. But the plan has received overwhelming support within the Church of England amid arguments that it would send out a signal that children are “fully included within the body of Christ”. During discussions at the Synod, which is meeting in York this weekend, members lined up to support the change insisting that opening up the administration of Communion to children was closer to its original form as a communal meal. Church’s £360,000 budget for retreats to talk about sex Sex abuse priests could return to church without checks, warns Archbishop of York Elliot Swattridge, who represents the Church of England Youth Council on the Synod, said: “When Jesus instituted the first celebration of the eucharist during the last supper his words were simple: ‘Do this in remembrance of me’. “In this characteristically simple statement he instructed the entire body of his disciples to participate in not only receipt but also the administration of communion. “Note that Jesus did not state ‘do this but never administer it unless you have been ordained’. Neither did he state ‘do this but only of you are over 18 years of age’.” He added: “It was Jesus who rebuked the disciples for turning children away, instead setting them especially highly saying 'the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these'. “If the Kingdom belongs especially to children surely they are the most qualified of anyone to administer it.” Unlike in some of other traditional churches lay members in the Church of England routinely administer Holy Communion alongside priests. Under the current rules, which date back to the late 1960s, anyone who has been baptised and confirmed can distribute the sacrament in services as long as they have been given authorisation by a bishop. The new rules would sweep away the requirement to be confirmed altogether simply allowing anyone who is a “regular communicant”, including children, to distribute the sacrament. Children can already receive communion in the Church of England without being confirmed, following changes a decade ago. Alexander McGregor, the General Synod’s deputy legal adviser, said: \"There is no statutory age limit but of course under the regulations under which children can be admitted to Holy Communion if they’re not confirmed they nevertheless have to be capable of understanding the significant of the act that they are participating in and have to have been prepared for Holy Communion. “So we are not talking about five-year-olds, we are talking about probably children of nine, 10, 11 and so on.” But Synod papers show that senior clerics privately expressed concern about the plans when they were first put forward three years ago. One briefing paper on the change written by William Fittall, the Church’s most senior lay official, explains that the proposal had been analysed by the Liturgical Commission, the panel of clerics responsible for changes in services. Among concerns they cited was that “Children often lack the skills of co-ordination required to go through the tricky tasks of administering a chalice and this could lead to spillages and vessels being dropped.” Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T03:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T18:17:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
