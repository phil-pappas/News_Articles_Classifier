It has been introduced due to requests from Pandaw travellers, who will be able to discover the natural wonders of the great rainforest with its varied wildlife, flora and fauna, and like Pandaw expeditions in Asia will visit friendly local villages and discover the unique way of life of the people living on the Amazon”.\nPandaw’s partner ship, the Amazon Dream, carries just 18 passengers offering a comfortable base with excellent French-influenced cuisine. The nine-night cruise is combined with land arrangements staying three nights at the elegant 5 star Sofitel Hotel, Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, with an included excursion to Corcovado and Sugar Loaf Mountain, and a two-night stay at the iconic Hotel Das Cataratas located next to the jaw-dropping Iguacu Falls.\nRelated Posts Amawaterways Windstar Cruises Announces 2015 Winter Voyage Collection Quantum of the Seas sets sail from her new homeport of Shanghai Classic Vacations Creates New Pre & Post Cruise Land Packages for Travel Advisors", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T22:47:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
