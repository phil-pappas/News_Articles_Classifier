From Brooklyn, N.Y. to Portland, Ore. chefs are busy manning their smokers, usually replicating one of the nation’s four major types of barbecue, throwing their allegiance to Memphis, Texas, Kansas City or Carolina-style ‘cue. \nBut the ultimate way to experience these regional styles is by tasting each destination — only then can barbecue fans truly pledge loyalty to one place. Below, the true expert breaks down the basics of each barbecue mecca.

Even so, traditionally, the pulled pork sandwich has been the king of Memphis barbecue.

The other telltale sign that you are at a Texas BBQ joint is the prevalence of European style sausages. There is good barbecue across the Lone Star state, but nowhere is the concentration greater – or better – than in and around Austin, a.k.a. “The Texas Barbecue Belt.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T11:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T19:27:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
