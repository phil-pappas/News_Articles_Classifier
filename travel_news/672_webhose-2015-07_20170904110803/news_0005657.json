Even lions don't dare take a chunk out of this beast unless they have friends helping them. Cape Buffalo are said to have killed more big game hunters than any other animal in Africa and are one of Africa's most dangerous animals. On the more open grasslands, Cape buffalo appear in large herds that can number up to a thousand individuals. Remarkably, there are few scuffles between herd members, perhaps the large males with their strong curved horns realize they could seriously injure one another in a brawl. Males will fight for dominance, but the battles are brief. Cape Buffalo need to drink every day, so are often found close to water and never in the desert. They prefer to eat tall, coarse grass as well as bushes. Cape buffalo numbers are shrinking because they are hunted for their meat, and they have also been the victims of various domestic cattle diseases. There are thought to be around 1 million Cape buffalo left in Africa.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T15:21:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
