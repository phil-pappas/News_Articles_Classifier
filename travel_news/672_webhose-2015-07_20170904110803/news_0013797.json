Leveraging a background in art history and an affinity for travel, Faith creates jewelry that is delicate yet makes a special statement. With her attention to detail and fully imagined line, it’s no surprise that EF Collection has an impressive celebrity following that includes Jessica Alba, Jennifer Lawrence, and Taylor Swift. We love her use of symbolism and the laid-back luxury of the diamond pieces—the Zig Zag stack rings are on our summer wish list. We found ourselves in Las Vegas at the same time, and we adored seeing life through Faith’s rose-colored glasses. —The Stone Set\nPhoto: Emerald Carroll\n“After graduating from the University of Southern California with a B.A. in art history, I wanted to do something that satisfied my passion for the arts and long love of fashion. Right out of school, I worked for women’s contemporary clothing and accessory designer Cynthia Vincent [Twelfth Street by Cynthia Vincent], first in design and then moved over to sales. sides, I was able to see the full spectrum of the business.\nSee More: Shourouk\nI then made the decision that I wanted to start my own business. Initially called Emily Faith Collection , I curated a collection of accessories featuring both my designs as well as other local L.A. designers. Slowly but surely, my clients took a liking to my delicate designs, then the celebrities and editors followed suit…I knew I was on to something. When I decided to solely feature my own designs, I shortened the name to EF Collection .\nEarly on, I realized there was a void in the marketplace for fine jewelry at a more approachable price point that maintained quality paired with chic design. I wanted to expose a broader audience to this highly desired 14-carat diamond jewelry, as well as provide good value. Aiming to have a piece for everyone, my clients range from the young teen to the mom-on-the-go to the hip grandma!\nPhoto: Emerald Carroll\nIn school, I was a visual learner. I was first intrigued by art history when studying Renaissance art and saw how, for example, a single painting could explain a whole period in history. My art history major afforded me the opportunity to study abroad in Rome for a little over a year, and during this time, I visited a ton of different cities. The art and travel broadened my perspective, but my personal aesthetic comes from my immediate surroundings, too—architecture, nature, friends, etc.\nSee More: Sophie Buhai\nMy jewelry is delicate, chic, sexy, and feminine. Every piece is meant to be worn and enjoyed daily. I try to put my own twist on architectural, geometric, and classic forms, keeping them fresh and modern while maintaining a sense of timelessness. I don’t think there is one particular piece that has become my trademark; rather it’s my aesthetic. Initially, it was the rings that garnered attention, but lately my unique earrings are gaining momentum, from ear cuffs and ear jackets to ear clips.\nPhoto: Emerald Carroll\nI personally wear my stack of Zig Zag rings (one in each finish) regularly, and constantly switch up the order. I also wear the Diamond Jumbo Crescent Necklace , which can be worn alone or easily layered with other necklaces. More recently, I’ve been enjoying the Multi Bezel Diamond Ear Jacket —I love that it can be worn with any stud (and it always attracts attention).\nI’ve always considered myself the more artistic kind, but after starting EF Collection , I’ve realized that I also have an entrepreneurial spirit. While I never envisioned having my own business, it’s incredibly rewarding and exciting to see an idea come to fruition and have others appreciate your craft. I didn’t grow up in a family of jewelers, nor do I have any formal training—my dad was a young entrepreneur and has mentored me on the business end from the beginning.\nPhoto: Emerald Carroll\nThere are many components to a successful business, and at times it’s challenging to keep all of the facets running smoothly. I wear a ton of hats, and each day things come up unexpectedly. When you’re thrown a\ncurveball it’s all about navigating and being resourceful! Thinking outside the box and coming up with effective solutions quickly is really important.\nI’ve learned to have fun and enjoy the journey. Always look for the good in tough situations. Nothing is perfect, and it’s OK to make mistakes!”\nSee More: Jennifer Alfano\nPhoto: Emerald Carroll", "external_links": ["http://thestoneset.com/shourouk/", "http://www.efcollection.com/", "http://www.instagram.com/efcollection", "http://www.efcollection.com/search?type=product&q=zig", "http://thestoneset.com/sophie-buhai/", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php", "http://thestoneset.com/jennifer-alfano-rising-rockstars/", "http://www.efcollection.com/search?type=product&q=multi+bezel+ear+jacket", "http://www.efcollection.com/search?type=product&q=diamond+jumbo+crescent+necklace"], "published": "2015-07-02T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T18:24:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
