As legend has it, Sarah Doukas, founder of Storm Models , saw the 14-year-old and thought she looked cool. For many, the oft-recounted moment is the fairytale beginning to a coveted career. A young Kate Moss was spotted in an airport check-in queue (Rankin) For Nicola Griffin, that fairytale came true. Two years ago, while queuing in a bank in Nottingham, Griffin received the tap on the shoulder. “It changed my life,” says Griffin. “It changed everything about my future.” At the time, she was 52, size 16 and steel grey. Nicola Griffin: 'Modelling changed my life' Griffin’s first modelling job was for White Hot, creators of hair products for grey and white hair. Today, as well as being the face of White Hot , Griffin has regular catalogue and beauty work. In her last job she was invited back to promote skincare for postmenopausal women. Griffin recalls the moment she was asked: “I said if it’s menopause, I’m your girl.” Nicola Griffin shooting on location The menopause might not be high fashion but right across the advertising sector are more faces than ever with wrinkles and age spots. When writer Joan Didion appeared in a Céline ad earlier this year the fashion world went weak at the knees. Aged 80 and wearing sunglasses the size of saucers, Didion looked small and vulnerable. • The older models at the very top of high fashion Yet the campaign was widely celebrated – no doubt in part because Céline, with designer Phoebe Philo at its helm, can do no wrong. But with actors Helen Mirren and Tilda Swinton bagging beauty contracts and fashion grandes dames Iris Apfel, 93, and Daphne Selfe, 86, appearing in high-profile fashion campaigns, perhaps the brouhaha over Didion’s Céline ad was caused by more than the marriage of literary and design heroes. Had fashion finally grown up? Iris Apfel is a style icon worldwide (Cindy Ord/Getty) Rebi Merilion and Fleur Brady, founders of model agency Mrs Robinson Management , are cautious. Mrs Robinson Management represents several models over 50 – a group they call Retro Woman. While they believe the beauty industry’s embrace of older models will remain, Merilion and Brady are open about the more fickle business of fashion. “It goes through trends,” says Merilion, adding: “And those trends tend towards the extreme. That is why we are seeing more models over 60 in high-end fashion. I’d like to see that continue while also seeing more of those opportunities for women in their forties and fifties.” Sarah Willey bares all on a shoot The \"retro women\" themselves are just delighted to be working. Sarah Willey, from Wiltshire, began modelling at 56 after being approached by a photographer. “I couldn’t quite believe it,” says Willey, now 67. The location of her first job – a lifestyle shoot for an image library – was next to the house where she met her husband. “It felt meant,” she says. “We had to sit around looking like ladies who lunch.\" • Tilda Swinton becomes the new face of NARS At 60, Willey moved into straight modelling, appearing in campaigns for John Lewis, Barclays, M&S and Lancome. She has just returned from a shoot in Milan, although Bethnal Green is a more frequent destination. “I use my old ladies card for the train and then get round London with my bus pass,” she says. • Grey is the new black for models “Modelling has been good for my confidence,” Willey says. “I started at a time when I was spending a lot of time looking after people. Modelling was an antidote – something challenging and selfish.” Debbie Grieve, 75, began modelling in 1964. Spotted while working as a secretary in London, Grieve quickly won a Pepsi Cola commercial. Shoot with Debbie Grieve “I earned more in that day than in six months as a secretary,” she says. Grieve enjoyed a successful modelling career, that included appearing on the cover of French Vogue, before taking a 20-year break to pursue other things. In the Nineties she returned, joining Mrs Robinson six months ago. “I do the work I choose,” says Grieve. “It supplements my pension and it’s a job I love. If I’m inspiring other people of my age then that’s great.” • Twiggy teams up with L'Oreal Do images of beautiful older women inspire a generation, or are they as dispiriting as images of the younger ideal? Debbie Grieve on a shoot Brady, who has worked as a model booker for 11 years, thinks the idea that older consumers feel inadequate in response to such images is an insult to their intelligence. “We all know there is more to life than looks,” she says. “I would hope that seeing more images of older women is inspiring for all generations – for the older generation in seeing honest, positive images that represent them, and for the younger generation in being exposed to the reality and beauty of growing older.” Whether or not it’s a force for good, Paris-based model Tanya Drouginska believes the trend for using older models is here to stay. Some of Tanya Drouginska's work (Olivier Metzger) “It’s another beauty people like,” she says. A model in the Seventies, Drouginska – who never reveals her age – returned to the industry 10 years ago, modelling for brands including The Kooples , Shu Uemura and Schwarzkopf . She describes her career as the centre of her life. “It is booming, but my ambitions have no limits. I fight for it to be as bright as possible.” • Twiggy's life in fashion Although Drougniska admits to having been afraid of aging since childhood, today it doesn’t faze her. “Age is not a date of birth but the energy we have,” she says. “I am lucky to have good health and I hope I will be the same in 10 years – always timeless and in action. If that’s impossible, I hope to be dead.” Willey, similarly, believes it is energy that draws us to an image. “I think we respond to people who are comfortable with themselves, regardless of age or beauty,” she says. “I look at a picture of Twiggy and I think she’s fantastic – her attitude, the way she holds her coat. It’s about animation.” Twiggy has had a long modelling career (Stephen Perry/BBC) Perhaps it’s no surprise that the women at the heart of the Swinging Sixties are seen and heard at an age when, as Griffin puts it, “our mothers disappeared wearing American tan tights”. Regardless of the strength of the so-called grey pound, it is hard to imagine these women are at the whim of an industry that is showing signs, at least, of having matured with them. • Are pensioners about the splurge the grey pound? Furthermore, Kristin Perers, photographer and author of the blog This is 50 , believes that no matter how old we are we always need role models. “The sight of older models reminds us that even at this age we are still the central characters to a drama – and worth being photographed, written and talked about. We still have stories to tell.” Follow @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T10:27:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
