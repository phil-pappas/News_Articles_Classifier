This translates to 750 delegates attending events at Woburn Forest each month in the first eight months of opening. \nThe Village, which celebrated its first year open to leisure guests in June, launched for Conferences and Events in October 2014 and has exceeded its budget by over 275%. Events to date at Woburn Forest have generated well in excess of £2.2m in revenue. The team at Center Parcs have worked hard since the launch to cater for an increasingly confident industry and have focused on areas including teambuilding in an inspiring setting – which is growing in demand. Woburn Forest launched brand new tailored packages for different personalities, and night-time tree trekking was announced in January. Purpose-built business facility The Venue has also hosted large brands looking for ample space for a conference, with the added opportunity to bond with their team afterwards. Ryan Gray, Head of Sales at Center Parcs, said: “We are delighted with the success of our fifth Village, Woburn Forest. Not only have we exceeded our expectations in terms of budget, we have hosted world-class events for clients including TPRG (Theo Paphitis Retail Group), Virgin Atlantic and The Body Shop and we were shortlisted for our first award at the Conference Awards 2015.” Hearing-aid specialist Amplifon held its All Employee Conference at Woburn in January. The Village was chosen for its ability to host 350 plus delegates, and featured a day of presentations, workshops, a gala dinner and a teambuilding programme. Steve Fleming, CEO UK & Ireland, Amplifon said: “We liked the newness of Woburn Forest from an accommodation and conference facility point of view, especially as it offered more conference space than our previous venue.” The Venue at Woburn Forest offers theatre-style seating for up to 500 delegates, and comprises eight individual and flexible event suites with full vehicle access, a business centre with free Wi-Fi, complimentary car parking, 675 forest lodges and a 75 bedroom luxury hotel.
