But how do you know which restaurants to choose? Today, we share 6 of our foodie finds for the Centre – Loire Valley region where you can be sure to eat the best produce the area has to offer. \nOne of the best things about slow travelling through France, is the abundance of fresh, local produce: fruit, vegetables, meat, cheese (!), and seafood. Although we enjoying buying food direct from farmers and preparing our own meals in our motorhome, sometimes it’s nice to let someone else do the cooking. But even with restaurants in France, it can be difficult to know exactly where your food is coming from. That’s why we were excited to be introduced to a range of restaurants, in the Centre Region, that work with only the best local ingredients, straight from the farm. \nWhether you’re enjoying culture in Orleans, exploring the nature of the Loiret, or visiting the chateaux of the Loire Valley, there is a great, local restaurant waiting to be enjoyed. Here are 6 of our favourite foodie options for local products in Centre. 1. Le Pavillion Bleu, Olivet Le Pavillion Bleu has a lovely atmosphere, beside the Loiret River \nLe Pavillion Bleu wins the CheeseWeb award for best atmosphere, in Centre. This restaurant, in the town of Olivet, near Orleans, was once a boathouse and this is reflected in the current architecture and décor. \nIts position on the Loiret River makes it ideal for spotting birds and wildlife, while enjoying your meal. When we visited, it was still slightly too damp to enjoy the stunning terrace, but we can imagine how popular this prime location must be in warm weather. The food is as stunning as the view \nBut the Pavillion Bleu is not all about the beautiful architecture and stunning views – the food speaks for itself. Bertrand Béreaud and his team create beautiful dishes featuring seasonal, regional products and the results are excellent. We enjoyed melt-in-the-mouth lamb and tender pork, with fresh and colourful vegetables. It was the perfect way to start our gastronomic tour of Centre and set a high bar for taste. \n351 Rue de la Reine Blanche 45160 Olivet 2. Le Jardin du Pavillion, Orleans The pretty terrace and the world’s coolest bar furniture at Le Jardin de Pavillion \nWhile visiting Orleans, we had the opportunity to dine at another pavilion, Le Jardin du Pavillion, in the city’s historic centre. This restaurant also features a stunning terrace, although here it is a private oasis in the heart of the city. Great quality meats feature strongly on the menu \nWe loved the home-made chips that accompanied our aperitif and our starters were fresh and tasty. However, the main draw at this brasserie is high-quality meat, so we were excited to taste the local beef and pork and we weren’t disappointed. \n5 place Général de Gaulle 45000 Orleans 3. Oh Terroir Fast (Good) Food, Orleans \nNot all great meals have to be fancy. Sometimes all we want is a great burger, but finding good quality fast-food is often more challenging than finding a high-end meal. That’s where Oh Terroir comes in. This small chain of restaurants in Centre, offers the speed and technology of McDonalds (you place your own order at touch-screen terminals) without the guilt and heartburn later. Fast food can also be good at Oh Terroir in Orleans \nWhile we were both jonesing for decent burgers, after burning tons of calories cycling, there are plenty of other options, including fresh salads, pasta, lentils, soups and more. All of the menu items are home-made, sourced locally, and/or are organic: from the meat in the burgers, to the fresh pasta, to the bio wines on offer. \nOh Terroir is the perfect option for a quick, healthy, guilt-free lunch in the heart of Orleans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T06:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T03:20:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
