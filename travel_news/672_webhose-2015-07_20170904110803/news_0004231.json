Once in Chile , teams travelled to the Geoaventura Parque for their first Road Block, a paragliding challenge. Teams then made their way to the San Miguel borough, where they took selfies in front of five murals spread throughout the neighbourhood. For the second part of the challenge, teams helped local children paint a mural. Hamilton and Michaelia successfully found a dancing couple in the Bellavista neighbourhood, earning them two Express Passes. Then, at the Detour, teams chose between learning a difficult dance routine or memorizing and reciting verses of a Spanish poem. Hamilton and Michaelia decided to use their Express Pass early, skipping the Detour, and ultimately winning the leg. Host Jon Montgomery greeted them at the Pit Stop in Cerro San Cristobal with their leg prize - premium economy tickets from Air Canada to Delhi, India , plus six months of free gas from Petro Canada™.
