But when she arrived with her boyfriend to check in on July 6, she claims staff told her; “I’m sorry, we don’t accept Romanians”.\nIt’s alleged that the hotel had adopted a policy of screening and turning away guests they believed could be engaging in illegal activity after discovering Romanian women were using its rooms for prostitution.\n“It was an awful experience and quite shocking,” Ms Puflea told the Telegraph .\n“He took one look at my ID and said that I could not stay in the hotel. I tried to show him my British driver’s license but he said I could not stay in the hotel because I was from Romania.”\nEven though Ms Puflea was slightly more understanding after discovering the reasoning behind the initial refusal, she still believes this policy should not be allowed to stand.\nThe Holiday Inn Express in Hull, where it all happened. Picture: A TripAdvisor traveller Source: Supplied\n“I was very upset when I found out the reason they had told me to leave. Not all Romanians are prostitutes.\n“Even though it made more sense when I found out about the problems they have had in the past, it is still discriminatory and it is still wrong. You can’t tar everyone with the same brush because of their nationality.”\nMs Puflea later filed a complaint with the Humberside Police. They investigated and released a statement saying the hotel had since apologised to Ms Puflea and was reviewing its policy.\nHowever, the Holiday Inn Express publicly denied the allegations, with manager Debra Hutchins telling the Telegraph : “This is definitely not a case of racial discrimination and the hotel declines to comment any further”.\nnews.com.au contacted the hotel for further comment.\nThis story originally appeared on FlyerTalk.com .\n ", "external_links": ["http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/not-all-romanians-are-prostitutes/story-fn6yjmti-1227459204034?sv=cdadb4f31f6088be408ff01c1189362f&title=%26%238216%3BNot+all+Romanians+prostitutes%26%238217%3B", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/not-all-romanians-are-prostitutes/story-fn6yjmti-1227459204034?sv=cdadb4f31f6088be408ff01c1189362f&h=%26%238216%3BNot+all+Romanians+prostitutes%26%238217%3B", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/not-all-romanians-are-prostitutes/story-fn6yjmti-1227459204034?sv=cdadb4f31f6088be408ff01c1189362f", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/not-all-romanians-are-prostitutes/story-fn6yjmti-1227459204034?sv=cdadb4f31f6088be408ff01c1189362f&title=%26%238216%3BNot+all+Romanians+prostitutes%26%238217%3B", "http://www.flyertalk.com/articles/we-dont-accept-romanians-woman-allegedly-denied-room-because-hotel-thought-she-was-a-prostitute.html", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11755074/Graduate-refused-hotel-room-because-staff-though-she-might-be-a-Romanian-prostitute.html", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=%26%238216%3BNot+all+Romanians+prostitutes%26%238217%3B&c=A+WOMAN+booked+a+hotel+room+online%2C+only+to+be+turned+away+when+she+tried+to+check+in.+The+reason+behind+the+refusal+left+her+totally+stunned.&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/not-all-romanians-are-prostitutes/story-fn6yjmti-1227459204034?sv=cdadb4f31f6088be408ff01c1189362f", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/not-all-romanians-are-prostitutes/story-fn6yjmti-1227459204034?sv=cdadb4f31f6088be408ff01c1189362f"], "published": "2015-07-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T14:05:30.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
