They're all throwing a party on a ship and inviting you on their theme cruises next year. \nFirst up are zombies. Fans of AMC's \"The Walking Dead\" have been congregating at Walker Stalker conventions since the show's first season, and now that convention is heading to sea. \nThe Walker Stalker Cruise sails out of Miami on a three-night voyage to Nassau, Bahamas, plus one day at sea on the Norwegian Pearl from Jan. 15-18, 2016. Cruisers can expect stars from the show including fan favorite Norman Reedus, who plays the crossbow-toting Daryl, as well as Chandler Riggs (Carl), Emily Kinney (Beth), Sonequa Martin-Green (Sasha), Chad L. Coleman (Tyreese), Christian Serratos (Rosita), Lawrence Gilliard Jr. (Bob) and Ross Marquand (Aaron). Celebrity guests are subject to change. \nExpect Q&A sessions, zombie-themed parties, games and costume contests. Perhaps a game of zombie shuffleboard may break out. \nCost for remaining cabins start at $850 per person based on double occupancy although lower prices can be paid for cabins with three or four occupants. Price doesn't include taxes and fees of $225 per person. Details can be found at www.walkerstalkercruise.com . \nSwitching from the living dead to living legends, Def Leppard is planning a four-night cruise on the MSC Divina along with a who's who of supporting 1980s-era rock artists for the band's inaugural \"Hysteria On The Seas\" fan cruise. Sailing from Miami from Jan. 21-25, 2016, with stops at Grand Bahama Island and the private island Half Moon Cay as well as one day at sea, the cruise will feature the band known for hits such as \"Photograph,\"\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\" and \"Rock of Ages.\" \nAlso on board will be former Cinderella frontman Tom Keifer; Mr. Big bandmember Eric Martin, Kip Winger, Ritchie Kotzen, Last in Line and more. \nThe event kicks off with a pre-party in Miami on Jan. 20 and continues on board with performances, meet and greets, Q&As, photo opportunities and more. \nCabins start at $899 per person, based on double occupancy, and that includes admission into the pre-party. Taxes and fees are extra. Details can be found at www.DefLeppardCruise.com . \nWhile those cruisers might be partying like it's 1989, current Super Bowl champion and New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, known to throw a party or two, is planning the Gronk's Party Ship cruise from Miami from Feb. 19-22, 2016. \nThe three-night cruise departs Miami heading to \"Gronk's Island,\" aka Great Stirrup Cay, plus a day at sea on the Norwegian Pearl. \nBilled as a cruise \"that will bring you back to those days of partying hard, spring break style,\" Gronkowski's \"teammates\" for the cruise will include musicians 3Lau, Waka Flocka Flame, Sammy Adams and more. \nPrices start at $700 for an inside cabin, based on double occupancy and not including taxes, fees and gratuities.
