Collective accommodation categories registered increases in total nights spent, with the exception of 5-star and 2-star hotels. \nThe largest share of guest nights was reported in 4-star hotels, accounting for 383,230 nights, or 46.3 per cent of the total. \nThe average length of stay in collective accommodation establishments stood at 5.3 nights during the month under review, at par with May 2014. The net use of bed-places stood at 69.0 per cent, up by 2.4 percentage points when compared to the corresponding month last year. \nOn a national level, there were 159 active collective accommodation establishments during May, with a net capacity of 17,825 bedrooms and 38,804 bed-places. \nTotal arrivals during the first five months of 2015 amounted to 572,409, an increase of 2.1 per cent over the same period in 2014. \nTotal nights spent went up by 1.6 per cent, reaching nearly 3.0 million. The net use of bed-places advanced by 2.6 percentage points to 55.2 per cent. \nMTA reacts \n\"These results continue to confirm the trend emerging from the overall inbound tourism figures published by the National Statistics Office which indicate very clearly that the number of tourists choosing to stay in non-collective private accommodation is increasing at a much faster rate than in collective accommodation,\" the Malta Tourism Authority said in a statement. \nMTA CEO Paul Bugeja reacted positively to these figures saying that the current year’s excellent results are being spread amongst the various components of the industry including the traditional laggards in the lower categories, which from other data available have shown an increase in their average room rates on a consistent basis. \n\"Such performances shall contribute strongly to these categories’ profitability and employment potential, supporting their long term sustainability, creating further confidence in their investment and upgrading strategies. These will in turn continue to consolidate Malta’s competitiveness as a tourism destination in the years to come.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:56:18.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
