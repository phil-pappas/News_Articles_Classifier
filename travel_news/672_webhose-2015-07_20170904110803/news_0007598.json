The Associated Press \nKENNEWICK, Wash. — Officials say a Benton County sheriff’s deputy shot and wounded a domestic violence suspect after he refused to drop a gun during a standoff. \nThe Tri-City Herald reports that the shooting came after police responded for the third time in two days to the home of 56-year-old Robert Bevel. The first two calls came in on Friday and involved verbal abuse. No arrest was made at that point. \nBut on Saturday afternoon, officials received another call, this time reporting that Bevel had dislocated the shoulder of his adult son. Kennewick Police Capt. Ken Lattin says officers obtained a felony arrest warrant for Bevel and set up a perimeter around the property. A crisis negotiator was unable to persuade Bevel to cooperate, and around 7 p.m. he walked out of his trailer with a gun. \nVeteran Deputy Scott Surplus shot Bevel in the shoulder. He was taken to Trios Southridge Hospital. Most Read Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T16:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T16:13:40.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
