Here he describes the day’s events. \nBy chance, we went on an excursion on Friday, otherwise my girlfriend and I would have been on that beach ourselves. \nWe got back to our hotel at about 4.30pm and the hotel was on lockdown. \nPeople in the UK seemed to be getting more news than we were. Given the information that there might be a second gunman on the run, people had barricaded themselves into their rooms. \nIt was chaotic in the hotel reception. People were shouting, swearing and arguing – and nobody knew what was happening. \nThere were two reps from Thomson and First Choice, but with such high tensions, it was hard for them to handle. \nWe were told it was a mandatory evacuation and we queued to give our names for flights home. \nA Tui crisis team arrived from Hanover on Saturday evening, telling us evacuation was not mandatory and that we could stay. \nSome guests decided to, but we felt it was no longer a “holiday”, sitting on the beach just 10 metres from where people had been killed. \nWe were asked to stay in our room and wait for flight information. At 5.30pm on Sunday, we were given 10 minutes to get on the coach. We then stopped at the attacked hotels and drove straight in – I was surprised there wasn’t more security. \nTui said it would refund us for our holiday from Friday – nine days’ worth. But because so many people are changing their plans, everywhere is fully booked or too expensive, so we will postpone rebooking until later this year. \nWe initially had a wonderful holiday. Tunisia is a nice place. I hope it can recover. \nDaniel Hoggan of digital agency Mediaworks is one of TTG ’s Tomorrow’s Travel Leaders and was on a Thomson holiday at Royal Kenz Hotel, neighbouring the two targeted Riu properties", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T12:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T10:16:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
