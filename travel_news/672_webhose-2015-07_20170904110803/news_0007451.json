But it’s there,” said EWG senior analyst Sonya Lunder.\n“The results are significant because even trace exposure to asbestos can cause cancer and other fatal lung diseases.”\nThe products that test positive for asbestos, all of them made in China, were:\n• Amscan crayons\n• Disney mickey mouse Clubhouse crayons by Greenbrier International Inc\n• Nickelodeon Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Crayons by MII Inc\n• Saban’s Power Rangers Super Megaforce crayons by Greenbrier International Inc\n• Black fingerprint powder in the Toys R Us Eduscience Delux Forensics Lab kit\n• White fingerprint powder in the Buy-Rite Inside Intelligence Secret Spy kit\nAustralian unions and asbestos support groups have called for tougher enforcement of our asbestos ban, warning that young lives are at risk.\nACTU Assistant Secretary Michael Borowick urged the Federal Government to boost the ABF’s funding to “ensure they are equipped to enforce the ban on asbestos.”\n“Asbestos has already killed many thousands of Australians, and sadly the full impact of asbestos-related diseases is not expected to peak until 2020,” Mr Borowick said.\nABF Commissioner Roman Quaedvlieg told The Australian the dangerous products were slipping “below the radar” and vowed to bolster the force’s seizure efforts.\nBut he admitted the agency had struggled to win convictions ­“because of the difficulty in terms of proving the source and the ­intent”.\nThe comments came after a delegation from unions and asbestos ­support groups travelled to Canberra to put forward their case.\nMomentum is gathering around the world for a crackdown on asbestos in children’s toys, with supporters calling on retailers to stop selling products that contain the deadly fibre and tweeting the hashtag #PlayingWithAsbestos.\nAs #ChinaFTA lowers import standards, finding #asbestos in crayons is a wake up call for all Australian parents... http://t.co/SMJKzeftwv\n— Jane McDermott (@JaneMcDermott6) July 16, 2015 No consumer products should contain asbestos. Unthinkable it is in crayons. #PlayingWithAsbestos\n— KathyStoddard Torrey (@kstorrey) July 15, 2015 One Twitter user demanded that Amazon “stop selling kids toys that contain deadly asbestos”.\nA Google search this morning revealed that a range of Amscan crayon products had been pulled from the retailer’s website.\nIn a statement to Time magazine, Toys “R” Us — which makes one of the forensics lab kits — said it was “reviewing the referenced report, along with supplier test reports, to ensure full compliance to our strict safety standards”.\nFour other distributors did not respond to the publication’s request for comment.\nThe EWG Action Fund is a spin-off of the Environmental Working Group, is a leading public health organisation in the United States, where is it lobbying for an asbestos ban in that country.\nAn independent laboratory — the Scientific Analytical Institute of Greensboro, North Carolina — tested 28 boxes of crayons and found asbestos in four of them, according to the EWG report.\nThis allegedly included an asbestos concentration of one per cent found in a CSI -style science kit.\nOriginally published as Customs crackdown on killer crayons", "external_links": ["http://t.co/SMJKzeftwv", "https://twitter.com/JaneMcDermott6/status/621571866377850880", "https://twitter.com/kstorrey/status/621341380388982784", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/PlayingWithAsbestos?src=hash", "http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/killer-crayons-asbestos-fears-as-toys-slip-under-the-radar/story-fnkgdftz-1227451909149", "http://www.theaustralian.com.au/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChinaFTA?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/asbestos?src=hash"], "published": "2015-07-22T16:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T03:34:13.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
