(Shutterstock photo) \nFacebook is just not for the young! Can't fathom the reason behind us telling you this? Well, a survey suggests that many senior British people are already searching for girlfriends of their younger days on the social networking site. \nThe survey from the Britain-based Silversurfers.com, the website for the over 50s, found that one in six Britons over the age of 50 are logged on to Facebook to find old flames and upload selfies to show how well they have aged, the Daily Mail reported. \nNearly half of the people over 50 on Facebook think they will use the site more and more as this will help them stay in touch with their girlfriends. \n\"Over 3,000 people completed our survey and the message is clear: Facebook is king of social media for the over-50s,\" Martin Lock, CEO of Silversurfers.com, was quoted as saying. \nThe survey also revealed that the most popular type of Facebook posts for people over the age of 50 are nostalgia, human interest photos and handy tips. \nNearly 81% said that they check Facebook more than once a day while 37% stated that they often check what friends are up to on Facebook. \nBeing comfortable using Facebook will help older people stay connected to their families and friends and may help alleviate loneliness in later years, the findings showed. \nFacebook is by far the most popular social networking site -- among others such as Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram and Google+ -- for people over the age of 50, it said.
