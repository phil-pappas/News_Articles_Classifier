Warm water from the western Pacific has sloshed eastward, piling up in the central and eastern part of the basin.\nThe sprawling area of warm waters has proven to be a boon for Pacific tropical cyclone activity, near record levels through mid-summer. Through a positive feedback mechanism, these cyclones have likely helped to reinforce the westerly push of warm waters, Slate’s Eric Holthaus reporte d.\nThe 2015 El Niño event is now neck-and-neck with record-setting event of 1997-1998 in terms of its mid-summer intensity.\nThat 1997-1998 event was notorious for its winter flash floods and mudslides in California.\nMichael Ventrice, a meteorologist for the Weather Company, said the atmospheric footprint of this year’s event — given the time of year — is statistically extremely rare and has a less than one in 1,000 chance of occurrence.\nColossal El Nino forcing during late July..

And the average for July could make it.”\nThe large group of El Niño models, both dynamic (based on physical processes) and statistical (based historical data), mostly forecast at least a strong event — likely to peak in the fall. Collectively, the IRI described the model simulations as “off-the-charts”:\n“[El Niño] is growing and the prediction models say it’s going to get stronger,” Barnston said. “And that’s our prediction, that it will become a strong event, most likely.”\nA few models, notably the European model and the National Weather Service CFS model, point to the possibility of a near-record event in which a very strong or “super” El Niño develops.\nThe only two super (or very strong) El Niños in the historic record occurred in 1982-83 and 1997-98.\nRecent biases in ECM SST forecasts suggest max of 2.2-2.3 deg anoms, close to 82-83 & 97-98 strength pic.twitter.com/fJo2yOvavI\n— Todd Crawford (@tcrawf_nh) July 15, 2015\nPerhaps hinting at an El Niño rivaling history, models have been trending stronger with their forecast month after month after month — as they absorb more data reflecting the true state of the current event and how it’s evolving.\nWhile some models show El Niño possibly maxing out in record territory, NOAA climate analyst Michelle L’Heureux expressed some skepticism about such projections in an interview with Mashable’s Andrew Freedman . “L’Heureux noted that none of the major forecasting centers responsible for monitoring El Niño are predicting a record event at this time,” Freedman reported.\nNOAA says the “forecaster consensus” is for a strong event but doesn’t specify how strong. Its forecast calls for El Niño to persist through the winter (90 percent chance) and early spring (80 percent chance).\nRecommended: The Guardian names Costa Rican journalist among ‘young climate campaigners to watch’ ahead of Paris 2015\n© 2015, The Washington Post", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/tcrawf_nh/status/621329633355632640", "http://t.co/LqQf9Ltpae", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/wp/2015/07/15/4-reasons-the-atlantic-hurricane-season-has-been-so-quiet-and-is-likely-to-stay-that-way/", "https://twitter.com/EricBlake12/status/623120921516093440", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ElNino?src=hash", "http://mashable.com/2015/07/09/strongest-el-nino-on-record/", "https://twitter.com/MJVentrice/status/622749752988295168", "http://t.co/flBn4X9dos", "http://t.co/fJo2yOvavI", "http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/07/07/el_ni_o_typhoons_in_the_pacific_ocean_will_have_global_consequences.html", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/wp/2015/07/17/earths-warmest-june-keeps-2015-on-record-breaking-pace/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/climate?src=hash"], "published": "2015-07-22T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T03:10:28.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
