An American Hotel and Lodging Association (AH&LA) member, Omni’s donation supports AH&LEF’s mission to provide resources for hospitality-related education, research projects, and vital opportunities that benefit the lodging industry.\nMichael Deitemeyer, president of Omni Hotels & Resorts and a member of AH&LA’s Board of Directors said, “It is a privilege to contribute to the important work that AH&LEF is doing to provide training opportunities for our team members, cultivate our leaders, and shed light on our dynamic industry through its research.“ He added, “Omni is committed to giving back to the communities within our industry. This donation to AH&LEF’s 2015 Annual Giving Campaign is one way to meet that commitment. We appreciate the work that AH&LEF does, and look forward to the innovative ways that the Foundation utilizes these funds.”\n“As one of the most recognizable luxury brands in the world, Omni is showing that they are dedicated to funding the future of the industry,” said Joori Jeon, AH&LEF president/COO. “The Foundation, and the students and employees we support, rely on industry leaders to help make this future a reality.”\nThe Annual Giving Campaign is AH&LEF’s key yearly fundraising initiative supported solely by the hospitality sector. Initiated in 1997, the program generates funds for AH&LEF’s core programs that provide hospitality management students with academic scholarships, offer grants for pertinent industry research such as diversity and technology advancement, and promote hospitality as a career of choice. Hundreds of thousands of dollars have been raised through the campaigns, and the Foundation is scheduled to disburse more than $1 million in scholarships this year.\nAH&LEF is the not-for-profit affiliate of AH&LA and is funded solely by charitable donations from progressive hospitality leaders and companies within the industry. In 2014, AH&LEF disbursed approximately $1 million to prepare promising college students for a career in hospitality, to attract and retain talented industry professionals, and to fund valuable research for lodging properties. Since the Foundation’s inception, more than $19 million has been distributed through its scholarship, education, outreach, and research programs.\nRelated Posts Lisa Lewis Joins Associated Luxury Hotels As National Sales Manager In The U.S. West Region Jason Pomeranc, hotelier announces launch of new brand of hotel Sixty Hotels Celebrate the holiday season at Moon Dance Cliffs Hotel & Spa Omni Hotels & Resorts to Manage Famous King Edward Hotel Omni Hotels & Resorts Introduces Big Incentive for Summer Vacations with Launch of its Summer Passport Campaign", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T21:35:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
