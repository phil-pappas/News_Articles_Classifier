It sells a variety of homemade delicacies and sweets such as cupcakes and dates.\n\n\"People visit this place not only to dine but also to relax, hang out with friends and families, read books and take brief strolls at the souq,\" said an employee of the shop.\n\nThere has been an increase in the number of visitors during the Eid holidays, as restaurants, cafes and shops remain open from the morning until midnight.\n\nMany restaurants serve breakfast as early as 7am during the weekend, offering a selection of delicious dishes.\n\nIn addition, a number of shops for abayas, clothes and personal accessories also opened recently.\n\nAccording to a source, most of the shop owners are Qatari women who have been given an opportunity by the management to become successful entrepreneurs.\n\nPerfumes, men's and women's clothes, sweet shops, handmade home decoration, personal accessories such as bags, handicrafts and traditional musical instruments will all be among the items that will be showcased in outlets to be opened soon.\n\nAl Wakrah Souq also has a mosque and a huge parking area to accommodate the growing number of vehicles. Parking is free of charge as of now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T18:01:11.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
