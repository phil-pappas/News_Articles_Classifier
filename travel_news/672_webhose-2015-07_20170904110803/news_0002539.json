Pat Barrett \nThis way to start your search for fairies. \nIt has an excellent picnic area (but without any running water), fantastic views from not only the summit but the car park and half way up the hill too, a good track (sometimes muddy), and a rapidly changing forest mosaic that will keep all comers entranced with its beauty and diversity. \nMy family covered the bases when we visited with a picnic lunch to spur the troops onto a higher order of activity. \nYes, team, we do have to climb the hill and ascend the windy trail to the summit at Lavericks Peak, 755m and just 150m higher than the roadside carpark. \nIt's a toss-up between two superlatives when you visit here. \nIs it the views or the forest diversity which claim first prize? \nI can't make a decision even though I have been here more than once. \nThe view just improves beyond all expectation as once at the flat summit, which is encircled by columns of basalt cliffs and presents a formidable aspect from back at the road, the view grants a complete 360 degree panorama of rocky tors, steep farmland, vegetated gullies, beach, bay and ocean. Ad Feedback \nTake it all in - fantastic. There's even room up here for a second lunch stop, as long as the wind isn't howling. \nThen there's the forest. Dry and shrubby down low, it morphs into a full immersion in the cloud forest as you reach the bluffs. \nYou quickly realise that it's now very damp both underfoot and all around as mosses, ferns, and lichen predominate. \nStraight-trunked totara guard the path like a pack of loose forwards, hemming in the trail and marking out the way ahead. \nWands of ferns hang from branches and, if it's a cool and cloudy day, mist will be hanging amid the trees, a spectre of gloom coating all with moisture. \nA great ambiance where fairies may reside, if you fancy. \nBeyond the summit the track continues east, along and then down a fenceline, steeply at first. \nThen it enters the canopy forest on the south side of Lavericks Peak where broad leaf, fuschia, mountain holly, and five finger compete for space. \nThe tracks angles off into a shallower decline further down and then intersects with the upward trail to take you back to the carpark. \nA great hike, and once into it, the kids loved the sense of discovery at every bend. \nThey raced on ahead while I was taking pictures, so I had to hoof-it up the track to find them before they were claimed by the forest goblins which seem to go with the territory here. \nWe didn't see any, but perhaps you might. \nMORE INFORMATION \nAccess : Marked access road On Summit Rd midway between Okains Bay Rd and Le Bons Valley Rd.
