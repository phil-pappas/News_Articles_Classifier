Surrounded by endless pines, the spots are quiet and with enough room between them so not everybody hears you... playing Yahtzee, of course. Explore the 15 miles of roads and trails, or bring your horse and enjoy equestrian access to over 700 acres. For cyclists, the park connects to the Cape Cod Canal bike trails and you can get to both downtown Sandwich and the ocean pretty quickly, as well. Either a plus or minus, depending on your perspective: Shawme-Crowell is a bit less \"wilderness-y\" than other camps and is equipped with showers and restrooms. \nHarbor Islands Boston, MA You probably didn't even know that camping was allowed on the Harbor Islands, did you? Well, it is... and there are four island destinations to choose from: Bumpkin, Grape, Lovells, and Peddocks. Each has its own signature mojo, but if we had to choose, you're snagging one of Bumpkin's three beachfront sites. It's carry in/carry out (you can hop the ferry to get there), and you absolutely won't mind because of the killer panoramas, cool ocean breezes, and campfires on the beach. Don't forget your H2O, sunscreen, and s'mores. Lots of s'mores.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T18:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T18:56:34.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
