Now available to book, these exclusive autumn breaks are the perfect way to usher in the autumn and winter gracefully. \nAt the heart of the 57 room hotel is the 3,000 sqm Le Grand Spa, which is one of Europe’s largest and offers a vast sanctuary for world-class wellness in partnership with British botanical wonder workers, Bamford. Extensive facilities include a Finnish sauna, herbal steam bath, ice grotto and detoxifying Laconium room, as well as a fully equipped gym, beautiful relaxation areas with water beds that overlook the mountains, a 15m swimming pool and a Jacuzzi opening up onto a lavender-clad terrace. Building on its reputation as one of Gstaad’s chicest yoga and wellness hangouts, with a weekly programme led by Nicole Von Grunigen, the hotel’s two brand new autumn retreats will be led by industry experts and incorporate yoga, meditation, psychology and diet, with cleansing menus created by Michelin starred chef, Urs Gschwend. Awakening the Self with Clemens Frede: 25-27 September 2015 Yogi, meditation expert and renowned performance psychologist, Clemens Frede, will host a two night weekend retreat ‘Awakening the Self’ this September. Clemens is trained in a multitude of yoga styles and meditation and this retreat will draw on mindfulness, philosophy, psychology and yoga to gain clarity on ‘the self’ and how to express love for life. Prices from £630 per person based on two sharing, including two nights’ accommodation, one or two yoga sessions and a fireplace talk per day, healthy brunch and dinner each day plus access to the spa and 15% off treatments. Prevent the Winter Blues with Chantal Soeters: 2-4 October 2015 Holistic health coach and yoga teacher, Chantal Soeters, will lead a weekend retreat in October. Eating heavier wintery foods such as stews and carbs paired with the tendency to hibernate indoors results in lethargy, stagnated energy and stiff muscles during the colder months. Chantal will teach guests how to combat the negative effects of the ‘winter blues’ through yogic breathing, nutritional advice and energising exercises. Prices from £630 per person based on two sharing, including two nights’ accommodation, one yoga session and one hike per day, healthy breakfast, lunch or brunch and dinner each day plus access to the spa and 15% off treatments. Summer rates start from £275 per room based on double occupancy on a B&B basis.
