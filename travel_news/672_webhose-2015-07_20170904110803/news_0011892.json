These changes will take place over the next few months, with a target of completing the programme by the end of the year.\n\"Virgin Atlantic is aiming to reduce its non-fuel costs through focusing on driving efficiency and simplicity throughout all areas of the business whilst delivering an even better customer experience.\nChief executive, Craig Kreeger, added: \"As a people oriented business, these are extremely tough decisions to take, but we know they are necessary to secure our future.\n\"We are committed to supporting our people as we deliver against these plans.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-07-01T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T20:45:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
