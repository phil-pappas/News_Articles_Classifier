Every night you'll rest up in comfy log cabins and boutique hotels – an invigorating combination of comfort and intrepid adventures.\n2. Best trip for... driving Route 66\nSelf-drive Route 66, American Sky\n© Susan Montoya Bryan/AP Photo A car travels down historic Route 66. Cover some serious ground on this independent road trip on America's most iconic highway. Self-drive Route 66, an American Sky holiday, takes you all the way from Chicago to LA – with accommodation, meals and recommended stop-offs along the way.\nLike all great road trips, Route 66 balances spectacular driving with lots of off-road adventures. The itinerary lists each one, alongside recommended timings, so you can stop off as much or as little as you like. We'd park up for a paddleboat cruise along the Mississippi river, a 72-ounce steak at the Big Texan Steak Ranch, a helicopter tour of Grand Canyon National Park, and a flutter in Las Vegas – to name but a few...\n3.

In Las Vegas, while you're soaking up the bright lights and slot machines of the Strip, the kids will no doubt be hurling themselves down the waterslide that runs through your hotel. Yes, really. They might even let you have a go too...\n4. Best trip for... budget-conscious travellers\nCamping America's West, G Adventures\n© Michael Szönyi/imagebroker/Corbis Bixby bridge, Big Sur, California, USA.

From £1,439 for 22 action-packed days, G Adventures' Camping America's Westpacks in real bang for you buck. The small print? You'll be camping every night. But with well-equipped pitches in spectacular surroundings, we think that sleeping under canvas is a treat rather than a chore.\nYou'll drive down the West Coast, stopping off to sunbathe and camp on windswept beaches, before heading inland to the sand dunes of Scottsdale, up to Moab and Monument Valley, and westwards again to the wineries of Napa Valley.\n5. Best trip for... a big bite of NYC\nNew York, Ramblers Worldwide Holidays\n© Craig Warga/Bloomberg Traffic moves along FDR Drive in Manhattan at dusk in this aerial photograph taken with a tilt-shift lens above New York, U.S..

You'll see all the iconic sights with an expert guide: the Rockefeller Center, Empire State Building, Smithsonian Museum, Central Park, the Statue of Liberty and Fifth Avenue – to name but a handful. By night, you'll catch plays on Broadway and dine in the city's best restaurants.\nYou'll venture out into New York State on a rail trip up the Hudson River Valley, a journey through colonial villages and beautiful countryside terrain. While it would be hard to pack in this much into an independent New York trip, this small group itinerary has it all planned out – so you can relax and enjoy the ride.\n6. Best trip for... Alaska adventures\nDenali Unexplored, World Expeditions\n© Mike Powell/Getty Images General view of the West face of Mt. McKinley in Denali National Park in Alaska. Alaska is by far the USA's biggest state – big on size, and big on drama. World Expeditions' 7-dayDenali Unexplored trip takes you up North America's tallest mountains, across minty-white glaciers, and even over ice-edged lakes on a float plane flight. Spectacular stuff.\nYou'll travel (mostly) under your own steam, trekking across the snowy terrain and camping every night like true explorers. It's all hands on deck: trekking by day, and setting up camp and cooking every evening. This no-frills itinerary gets you to the heart of Alaska – and by travelling largely on foot, you'll get a real sense of the state's unparalleled scale.\n7. Best trip for... Southern charm\nDixie Dreaming, Audley\n© Ocean/Corbis Boats afloat the Mississippi River in front of the Memphis skyline at dusk. Venture into the Deep South on Audley'sDixie Dreaming trip: a 19-day round-trip from Atlanta through Memphis, New Orleans and South Carolina, on a private itinerary. One each stop-over you'll find something fun to do: dance the night away in a honky tonk country music bar, explore New Orleans' French Quarter, and take a trip on the world's steepest railway at Lookout Mountain near Alabama.\nThis trip takes you to the birthplaces of country, blues, jazz and rock n' roll music, and there are plenty of foodie highlights too. Stuff yourself with Cajun and Creole delights in Louisiana before working it off on a hike through Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Reserve – a wetlands park where you'll spot white-tailed deer, alligators, and lots of protected birdlife.\n8. B est trip for... leaf peeping in New England\nSix States: One Fabulous Fall, Frontier Travel\n© Shutterstock/Wanderlust Autumn in New England. Is there anywhere better to see autumn colours than the leafy states of New England? If you're travelling between September and October, Frontier Travel's 14-night Fabulous Fall trip takes you to the best leaf-peeping spots, such as the thick forests around Sebago Lake in Maine. In Vermont, you'll stumble upon country stores, artist’s studios and sprawling farms, and in Connecticut rewarding hiking trails await.\nTrace the colonial days of Newport, and meander through the antique shops of Sandwich, Cape Cod. The quaint Americana village of Woodstock is a highlight, as is the summit of Mount Washington (don't worry, there's a train to the top). There's plenty of history to soak up, too: stop off at plantation museums and the spot where the founding fathers first set foot in America.\n9. Best trip for... incredible national parks\nYellowstone & Grand Teton, Peregrine\n© Ingo Arndt/Minden Pictures/Corbis Tourists viewing Grand Prismatic Pool, Midway Geyser Basin, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. Exploding geysers, burping puddles of mud, and towering mountains – the natural beauty of Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks is big on wow-factor. Peregrine's group tour around the two parks includes guided walks, overnight accommodation in rural ranches, and incredible photographic opportunities aplenty.\nIn Yellowstone, you'll trek through dense woodland and past bubbling geothermal pools, keeping an eye out for grizzly bears on the slopes of Mount Washburn. In Teton, you'll trek up the bizarrely-named Disappointment Peak (trust us, it should be re-named Awe Peak) – with Grand Teton looming over the glacial moraines and vast pine forest.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.wanderlust.co.uk/tripfinder/operator/audley_122/dixie-dreaming_14004", "http://www.wanderlust.co.uk/tripfinder/operator/explore_127/family-into-the-wild-west_7674", "http://www.wanderlust.co.uk/tripfinder/operator/g-adventures_158/camping-americas-west_11504", "http://www.wanderlust.co.uk/tripfinder/operator/world-expeditions_124/denali-unexplored_15687", "http://www.wanderlust.co.uk/tripfinder/operator/peregrine_172/yellowstone--grand-teton_15629", "http://www.wanderlust.co.uk/tripfinder/operator/ramblers-worldwide-holidays_174/new-york_17084", "http://www.wanderlust.co.uk/tripfinder/operator/frontier-travel_264/new-england-six-states---one-fabulous-fall_21087", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http:%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fAAcpgcn%3focid%3dsp&media=http:%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fAAcq64C.img&description=Bixby+bridge%2c+Big+Sur%2c+California%2c+USA+-+Michael+Sz%C3%B6nyi%2fimagebroker%2fCorbis", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fAAcpgcn%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fAAcpIKn.img&description=Acadia+National+Park+-+Robert+F.+Bukaty%2c+File%2fAP+Photo", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fAAcpgcn%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fAAcq0TM.img&description=A+car+travels+down+historic+Route+66.+-+Susan+Montoya+Bryan%2fAP+Photo", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fAAcpgcn%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fAAcq8xH.img&description=Monument+Valley%2c+Utah%2c+USA+-+Cultura%2fREX", "http://www.wanderlust.co.uk/tripfinder/operator/american-sky_288/self-drive-route-66-tour_60507", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fAAcpgcn%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fAAcpDpM.img&description=Tourists+viewing+Grand+Prismatic+Pool%2c+Midway+Geyser+Basin%2c+Yellowstone+National+Park%2c+Wyoming+-+Ingo+Arndt%2fMinden+Pictures%2fCorbis", "http://www.wanderlust.co.uk/tripfinder/operator/grand-american-adventures_224/appalachian-trail-walk-hotel_15874"], "published": "2015-07-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T11:12:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
