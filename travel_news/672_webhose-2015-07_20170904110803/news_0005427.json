On Monday night motorists reported flames coming from under the Bay Bridge in San Francisco on Monday night. \nTweeting motorists had this to day: Are you suggesting a burning bridge is dangerous? The fire will go out when it falls in the bay. No worries. \nWell, it is California, and the bridge was built by Chinese contractors, so... :) \nThe fire was reported at 10:09 p.m. near the East Treasure Island offramp. Accumulated debris in a 2-foot grated area caught fire under the bridge. The fire was extinguished quickly and no one was injured. \nThe left two lanes were closed while Caltrans engineers were on scene Monday night to evaluate what caused the fire. The blaze may have been caused by a cigarette that was tossed out the window.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T09:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T22:12:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
