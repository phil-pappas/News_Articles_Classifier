Comment Stuttgart Daily Leader - Stuttgart, AR By Submitted Posted Jul. 13, 2015 at 8:50 AM By Submitted Posted Jul. 13, 2015 at 8:50 AM STUTTGART — • Obituary for Jane Bowie On Sunday, Grand Avenue United Methodist Church in Stuttgart will be saying goodbye to its young pastor Clefton Vaughan and his family. Vaughan has accepted a position as the new pastor of the International Church of Bangkok in Bangkok, Thailand. Clefton, his wife Lindsey, and daughters Susannah Grace and Annabelle will be leaving for Thailand on Aug. 2. Clefton’s hometown is El Dorado. He received his Bachelor of Arts and Communication from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville and his Master of Divinity from Ashbury Theological Seminary in Kentucky. Vaughan and Lindsey Coleman were married on Oct. 14, 2006. Prior to coming to Grand Avenue UMC in June 2012, Vaughan was associate pastor at First United Methodist Church in Russellville, minister in the Bloxwich and Willenhall Circuit of the British Methodist Church in London, England, pastor of worship at Pulaski Heights United Methodist Church at Little Rock and pastor of outreach at Central United Methodist Church at Fayetteville. While at Grand Avenue UMC, Clefton has strived to enhance a strong youth program, introduced more Bible study time and outreach mission work. He has helped GAUMC live up to its mission statement of “Our Grand Purpose is to be an Avenue to Loving, Living and Sharing Christ.” Lindsey Vaughan has become a valuable member of the Grand Avenue UMC Chancel Choir. Daughters Susannah Grace, age 5, and Annabelle, age 2, are members of GAUMC pre-school Sunday School Class and Children’s Choir. Annabelle was born during their service here in Stuttgart. Regarding moving his young family to Thailand, Clefton says, “This has been a dream of mine. I had applied for foreign service and was waiting for something to come open. Lindsey and I have prayed about it and we are happy in our decision to make this move. We feel that God has put this opportunity before our family to serve him where we are needed most.” This family will be missed in Stuttgart. They will take with them from the congregation of Grand Avenue United Methodist Church much love and prayers for their happiness in this new phase of their life. A reception in their honor was held from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Sunday at the Grand Avenue UMC Fellowship Hall.
