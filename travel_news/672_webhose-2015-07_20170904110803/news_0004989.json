They are subject to availability. 1. Urville-Nacqueville, Normandy \nA short drive or cycle from Cherbourg brings you swiftly to idyllic coastal countryside and sweeping expanses of fine sand. Just west of Urville-Nacqueville, itself 10km west of the ferry port and a popular bathing station a century ago, the veteran Hôtel Landemer reopened last year following a stunning restoration. Bright, up-to-the-minute rooms with polished-oak floors look out over the Channel, and you can dine outside on a decked terrace. There’s surfing, windsurfing, sailing and diving nearby, as well as horse riding, and the long-distance GR223 footpath passes the hotel as it circles the Cotentin peninsula. \nDouble rooms at Hôtel Landemer from £110 (00 33 2330 40 510; le-landemer.com ). Assun Voile offers watersports (00 33 2330 33 052; assunvoile.com ), and Centre Equestre de la Valette horse riding (00 33 2330 35 769; centre-equestre-lavalette.com ). \nGreg Ward 2. Étretat, Normandy \nQuirky little Étretat, the most scenic spot on Normandy ’s chalky northern coastline, is sandwiched between spectacularly eroded cliffs. With its gingerbread architecture and stately promenade, it oozes Belle-Époque charm; you half-expect to find horse-drawn bathing huts on its shingle beach, though in fact it offers 21st-century activities such as paddleboarding. Choose from two contrasting hotels: at the Domaine Saint-Clair, an opulent Anglo-Norman castle, rooms named after the likes of Marcel Proust and Sarah Bernhardt are swathed in rich draperies, while those at the cheaper, eco-friendly Détective in town pay humorous tribute to assorted fictional investigators, from Hercule Poirot to Inspector Clouseau and even Charlie’s Angels. \nDouble rooms from £120 at the Domaine Saint-Clair (00 33 2352 70 823; hoteletretat.com ), £55 at the Détective (00 33 2352 70 134; detectivehotel.com ). \nÉtretat is the most scenic spot on Normandy’s chalky northern coastline (Photo: AP) 3. Sainte-Marine, Brittany \nBest accessed by a five-minute ferry ride across the River Odet from better-known Bénodet, the little port of Sainte-Marine cradles a lovely crescent of fine sand. Perched amid neat lawns above the jetty, the century-old Villa Tri Men surveys what’s been called the prettiest river in France. It’s now a sumptuous hotel, with bright, spacious bedrooms, many with balconies, plus a superb restaurant; there are also private cottages in the grounds. Ten minutes’ walk south, by way of sheltered coves tucked into the riverbank, brings you to the mouth of the Odet, where a supremely unspoiled beach, the Plage du Teven, stretches west for four long kilometres. \nDouble rooms at Villa Tri Men from £135; cottages from £180 (00 33 2985 19 494; trimen.fr ). \nGW 4. Trégastel, Brittany \nBrittany ’s Côte de Granit Rose is an irresistible playground for family holidays. Peppered with golden-sand beaches, interspersed with headlands of tangled woods and heather, it’s adorned throughout with glistening pink-granite boulders, eroded into strange shapes and stacked in gravity-defying disarray. Tiny Trégastel centres on one of its largest and prettiest beaches, beautifully illuminated each evening by the setting sun. The seafront Hôtel Beau Séjour offers great-value rooms with jaunty seaside décor, including an excellent family suite with a large rooftop deck, plus a good restaurant and crêperie. Best of all, the owners also run a bakery; the breakfast buffet spread of fresh-baked breads and pastries has to be seen to be believed. \nDouble rooms at Hôtel Beau Séjour from £62; breakfast £8.50 per person (00 33 2962 38 802; beausejoursarl.com ). \nGW 5. Plage de Gatseau, Île d’Oléron \nThe Île d’Oléron is off the radar of most British holidaymakers, despite the fact that much of the coastline of France’s second-largest island has undeveloped sandy beaches backed by dunes and pine woods. Miles of beach extend along the south-west coast, with acres of space for ball games at low tide, and often good surf for body boarding. But Oléron’s prettiest strand is the more intimate Plage de Gatseau near St-Trojan-les-Bains: overlooking the channel between the island and mainland, its soft sand is spattered with shells. Oléron Les Pins Indigo Campsite is a delightful, back-to-nature site set in a pine forest, 10 minutes by bike (rentals available) from Plage de Gatseau. \nPitches from £12 per night, pre-erected tents from £39, plus £17 booking fee (0033 4 37 64 22 34; camping-indigo.com ). \nFred Mawer 6. Conche des Baleines, Île de Ré \nOn the Île de Ré, you’re spoilt for choice for long, sandy beaches. For the most memorable, head to the far west – to Conche des Baleines, a vast crescent of golden sand, and the less well-known and more protected Trousse-Chemise, great for rock pooling. Both are fringed by pine woods that make ideal picnic spots. If you don’t want to shlep all the way out west, miles of dune-backed beaches, usually offering good body boarding, run along the south coast. Get a tide timetable: the beaches diminish to thin and in places overcrowded strips at high tide. But beaches are just one element of the Île de Ré’s appeal. Other draws include beautiful, carefully preserved villages, gourmet food markets, a striking landscape of saltpans, marshes and vineyards, and the fact that you can explore everywhere by bike on the many miles of cycle lanes. Wake up in France has a good selection of villas and houses on the Île de Ré. \nFrom £840 a week for a two-bedroom villa (0033 2 51 59 78 00; wakeupinfrance.co.uk ). \nFM 7. Gruissan, Languedoc \nTo the south of Narbonne, the flat, unkempt Languedoc littoral suddenly sprouts the rocks of the Clape Massif. This is a most welcome development. Tucked in below the massif is the little town of Gruissan, my favourite along this stretch of coast where new-build is the norm. Gruissan has a proper old centre, spiralling out from its castle. Beyond, more modern seaside requisites (bars, boats, blow-up dolphins) give way to a tangle of lagoons, marshland and outstanding beaches. Nearby are other, more remote, sands at Serignan and Portiragnes, plus great walking and wine among the ridges and smoky pines of the Clape hills. Best wine of all comes from Château Le Bouis. Here, just back from Gruissan, is a 300-year-old winery looking out over vines and sea, where - isn’t life well-planned? - one may also stay in what was the wine-maker’s manor house. In high summer the old stones also host a restaurant. I wouldn’t hesitate. \nDouble rooms at Château Le Bouis from £75 (0033 468 752525; chateaulebouis.com ).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T17:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T20:46:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
