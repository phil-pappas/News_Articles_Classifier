In Sweden, they strip off to their birthday suits and dive in.\nIt’s fair to say we don’t deal well with extreme weather conditions in the UK, but in Scandinavia they’ve turned it into something of a national pastime.\nAt least that’s what I tried to tell myself when faced with the prospect of skinny-dipping in a lake in sub-zero temperatures on a trip to Sweden’s capital Stockholm.\nEscorted by our tour guide – naked as the day he was born – I was among a group of rather anxious Brits standing in the snow on the edge of a jetty waiting to jump into the freezing waters below.\nA hole had been smashed in thick ice at the edge of the lake – big enough for a person to fall into, but not much more.\nWe had spent the previous 20 minutes naked inside a sauna surrounded by giant Viking men with vast bellies like Obelix.\nAs the sweat dripped on to the floor, the intense heat and the country’s famously relaxed attitude to nudity was preparing us for a very Swedish dip.\nIce ice baby: A skater in Stockholm\nOK – full disclosure now – we weren’t exactly naked. Being the awfully British spoilsports that we were, we wore swimming shorts below our towels so no one would notice and then clung on to those towels for dear life.\nJumping into water that could turn you into a popsicle is one thing. Having a bunch of strangers seeing your bits and pieces in the cold is something else entirely.\nStill, a quick submerge and a fair bit of shrieking later, it was all rather exhilarating. Because if there’s one thing Sweden does well, it’s turning Arctic conditions into entertainment.\nOver the course of four days, our group skated for miles across a frozen stretch of water, all without leaving the centre of a city that’s just two hours from the UK.\nMade up of 14 islands, the self-proclaimed “capital of Scandinavia” is a very appealing city with much to recommend it.\nThe ice skating was organised by a very helpful group called IceGuide, which provides skating tours on natural ice for all skill levels.\nSkating in a shopping centre ice rink is one thing – but this felt entirely more ­adventurous.\nWe didn’t have to travel far to find suitable conditions because an entire section of what is technically the Baltic Sea had frozen solid not far from the centre of Stockholm.\nOne minute we were walking through a snow-covered city park, the next we were skating across ice with specially adapted equipment that was somewhere between ice skates and skis.\nBlade runner: Mirror's Sam Rkaina in skating gear\nIceGuide provides everything, including skates, boots, safety equipment and on day tours even a packed lunch, which you will definitely need. Even for experts, skating across the sea can be hungry work.\nSpeaking of which, you won’t go hungry for long in Stockholm, thanks to a thriving restaurant scene and some very Scandinavian specialities.\nFrom the fish specialists at Blasieholmens Akvarium och Bar (BAR) to those famous Swedish meatballs, there’s something for everyone. My excellent hotel, the Skeppsholmen, even provides “award-winning” scrambled eggs that are certainly good enough to scoop up whatever the breakfast equivalent of the Oscars is.\nPick of the bunch though was Tjoget in the Hornstull neighbourhood, an area that has been gentrified in recent years to make it a very trendy destination.\nTjoget – in all its hipster glory – is ­therefore more than a restaurant. It also has two different bars and an old-school barbershop complete with cut-throat razor shaves and vintage chairs. The food is fantastic, the cocktails even more so.\nHome comforts: Skeppsholmen Hotel serves up famous meatballs (below)\nWhile we’re on the subject of must visits, you really can’t talk about Sweden without mentioning the world’s greatest pop group.\nFortunately for all Abba fans , there is now a dedicated museum on the island of ­Djurgarden that is well worth a look-see. Far more than the lazy cash-in it could have been, this exhibition has not only been put together with a love for the band, but also a real sense of invention.\nAs well as the expected memorabilia, you have the chance to sing your own karaoke version of classic songs, then record and download them from the internet at a later date.\nYou can do the same with video performances that put you right in the heart of an Abba video.\nIf bell bottoms aren’t your thing though, Stockholm offers around 80 more museums and attractions, including the world-class Modern Museum of Contemporary Art – as impressive as any gallery you’ll see.\nOf course there’s far more to see and do than you can take in during one visit.\nAnd that’s the naked truth...\nGet there British Airways flies to Stockholm from Heathrow from £93 one way. ba.com 0844 4930 787\nRooms at the Hotel Skeppsholmen cost from £110pn B&B based on 2 sharing inc wi-fi. hotelskeppsholmen.se/en/\nIntroductory day ice tours cost from £110pp inc equipment, lunch, transport.\n1-day Stockholm Visitors Card costs from £40 and gives entrance to more than 80 museums and attractions and unlimited use of public transport. visitstockholm.com/en/Stockholmcard/\nTourist info: visitstockholm.com and visitsweden.com\nTime zone: UK +1hr\nCurrency: Krona £1 = 12.8\nBest time to go: Chill out in Stockholm this winter\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.hotelskeppsholmen.se/en/", "http://www.visitstockholm.com/en/Stockholmcard/", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "http://www.visitstockholm.com/", "http://www.visitsweden.com/", "https://twitter.com/DailyMirror", "http://www.britishairways.com/travel/home/public/en_gb", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts"], "published": "2015-07-25T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T10:30:40.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
