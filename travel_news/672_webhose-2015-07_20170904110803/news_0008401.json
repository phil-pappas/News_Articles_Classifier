Travel briefs: Local travel events Travel Sunday July 26, 2015 5:00 AM Lincoln library to explore his dealings with Jews \nAn exhibit about Abraham Lincoln’s relationship with Jewish Americans will open next month in Springfield, Ill. \nThe Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum will host “With Firmness in the Right: Lincoln and the Jews” from Aug. 3 through Nov. 15. \nThe exhibit will include documents, letters, photos, Bibles and other artifacts — some of which haven’t been publicly displayed before. Lincoln’s appointment of the U.S. military’s first Jewish chaplain is among the documents. \nThe exhibit is a revised version of an exhibit that opened earlier in the year at the New York Historical Society. It was inspired by the book Lincoln and the Jews: A History by Jonathan D. Sarna and Benjamin Shapell. Winner of statue contest gets underwater wedding \nAug. 25 will mark 50 years since a statue of Christ was submerged 5 miles off Key Largo in the Florida Keys. \nThe 9-foot bronze Christ of the Deep statue rests in 25 feet of water in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. It has become a symbol for Key Largo’s John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, which is part of the sanctuary. \nThe statue, a replica of a sculpture in Italy, is a tourist attraction for snorkelers, divers and passengers on glass-bottomed boats who can see it from the surface. \nTo mark the anniversary, Amy Slate’s Amoray Dive Resort in Key Largo is sponsoring a contest with a prize of an underwater wedding at the statue and a stay at the resort for the best 100-word essay from a couple who would like to be married under the sea. \nThe entry deadline is July 31. Visit www.fla-keys.com/news/news.cfm?sid=9152 New website offers details about cycling Erie Canal \nThere is more than one way to travel the Erie Canal, and it doesn’t have to be by boat. \nA new website, www.cycletheeriecanal.com , is all about cycling the mostly flat 360-mile trail that runs alongside the famous waterway between Albany and Buffalo in upstate New York. \nThe website includes rider reviews, an interactive map, places to stay and suggestions for things to do and see along the way, from the Glimmerglass Opera near Cooperstown to the Susan B. Anthony House in Rochester. \n— From wire reports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T16:25:37.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
