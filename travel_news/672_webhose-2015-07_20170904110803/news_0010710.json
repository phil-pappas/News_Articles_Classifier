A senior official of one of the leading travel agencies stressed that Greece's stunning landscapes and scenery, good climate conditions and rich cultural heritage makes it one of the favourite destinations of people not only in the Gulf region but also from different countries around the world.\"Travellers may opt to take direct flights from Doha to Paris or Germany but they would often make a side trip to Greece,\" he said.The official also cited Greece's cheaper hotel rates and low airfares offered by airlines compared with the prices in other European countries.The possible impact the crisis may create is that travellers would be required to apply for a separate visa if Greece falls out of the eurozone. A majority of Greeks voted 'No' to a deal offered by the country's creditors in a referendum held on Sunday.Since a small number of tourists book to travel to Greece, a travel agency official in Doha noted that the crisis will not significantly affect their profit.\"As per Qatar market, the UK, France and Germany remain the top choices of travellers, especially during peak season. In fact last month, we were fully booked,\" he said.This was echoed by another leading travel agency in Qatar, an official of which said they usually have few clients who take direct flights to Greece year-round. However, the percentage of tourists from Doha to Greece has remained the same as in the first and second quarter last year.Athanasios Tseremeglis, 51, a mechanical engineer in Qatar, believes that tourism in his country maybe affected by the current crisis depending on factors such as financial stability, competitiveness of prices and services as against its neighbouring countries. \"To that extent, for example, high rates of value added taxes that are proposed from the European Union for hotels, restaurants and alike and rejected correctly from our government, would be catastrophic,\" he said. \"In long term I am confident we will get a big share as we can take advantage of our advantages such as culture, history, climate conditions, beautiful landscapes, and hospitality, among others.\"It is learnt that some 19mn tourist visited Greece in 2014 and generated around euro 13bn in revenues.However, Nikos Sirigonakis, a former Swissport and Qatar Airways ground staff who now stays in Greece, disclosed that the situation is completely different this summer.He said shops are shuttered, banks are still closed and signs of crisis are everywhere. \"Despite the odds, Greeks are friendly and they have their arms wide open to welcome visitors from all over the world,\" the Doha resident added.Some residents in Doha who had travelled to Greece told Gulf Times echoed the statements of the engineer saying they would love to go back to Greece for a holiday.\"A regular traveller like me cannot resist returning to Greece because of its beauty and of course the people who are very kind and hospitable,\" said Ronron, an airline employee who travelled to Athens a few years ago.
