According to Technavio , an independent tech-focused global research firm, the market for travel and business bags is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.58% by revenue and 8.31% by volume in the next four years. Key vendors of travel and business bags in the U.S. include Briggs & Riley, Delsey, Eagle Creek, Samsonite, Travelpro, Tumi and Victorinox. Although these vendors cater to travelers in general, each have their own strengths. Samsonite and Delsey are leading the pack in creating smart luggage. Samsonite is releasing a bag with a global tracking device, and Delsey is launching a bag with a phone charger. Travelpro , known for having direct selling relationships with flight crews, is also working on producing a carry-on bag with built-in external USB, and exploring a variety of tracking devices. \"We want to ensure that the technology and consumer value behind the tracking devices is totally sound before going to market,\" says Scott Applebee, Travelpro's vice president for marketing. \"Many of the tracking devices today are very expensive when you add in the data charges.\"Other luggage vendors are focusing on innovations that allow travelers to pack more efficiently on either a carry-on or checked baggage. Briggs & Riley has compression technology that expands the luggage without altering its original size; Eagle Creek has the Pack-It system which allows travelers to pack items flat and compact; and Victorinox has a dual-access design that accommodates different personal packing styles. Tumi has a collection that addresses the specific needs of female travelers. We looked at some of the latest and most innovative luggage from these vendors and matched them with different types of travelers -- from the chronic over-packer to the worrywart.
