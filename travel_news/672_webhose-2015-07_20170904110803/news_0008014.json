Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposes the Iran deal as an \"existential threat\" and retains Israel's right to attack Iran. Asked to indicate their level of support for various compensation options proposed during and after negotiations: 7.9 percent support increasing annual US aid to Israel from $3.5 billion to $5 billion . Israel currently receives the largest share of the total US foreign aid budget. The Obama administration is offering increased aid to reduce Israeli opposition to the deal. No specific package has been announced. 4.1 percent favor giving Israel deep penetrating \"bunker buster\" bombs of the type designed to destroy fortified targets. Michael Makovsky , president of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, has widely promoted giving the weapons to Israel along with the bombers needed for delivery. 4.0 percent support providing Israel with B-52 long-range bombers. Israel's air power is thought to be inadequate for distant targets such as Iran. Former Middle East advisor Dennis Ross proposed that B-52s bombers would give Israel a more \"credible\" deterrent threat against Iran . 3.4 percent favor releasing jailed Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard to Israel . Pollard is serving a 30-year prison term for spying on the US for Israel and is eligible for mandatory parole in November. Pollard will not be able to travel to Israel unless there is special intervention by the Obama administration. While 12.8 percent favor \"all of the above\" compensation options be given to Israel , an overwhelming 67.8 percent of Americans chose \"none of the above.\" The IRmep poll, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.2 percent, was fielded to 1,500 respondents July 25-26 by Google Consumer Surveys.
