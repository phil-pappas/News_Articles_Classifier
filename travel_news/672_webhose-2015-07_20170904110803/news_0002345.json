Martin was forced to pull out of the Tour after breaking his collarbone. Martin joins a long and [in]glorious list of riders who have quit the Tour while wearing yellow. It includes Wim van Est who fell into a ravine in Aubisque in 1951, Michel Pollentier who was expelled for attempted fraud in a doping test and our very own Chris Boardman who suffered a head injury while wearing yellow in 1998. MTN Qhubeka make history You will not find a better feelgood story at this year's Tour de France than MTN Qhubeka, the 'first African team' to compete in the 112-year history of the race (NB this is not strictly true but it makes for a better yarn). Competing with five African riders and four non-Africans, and raising money for Qhubeka - a South African charity which aims to mobilise Africans by giving them bikes - their fans have been making a huge din around the team bus each morning. They will be sure to raise the volume by a few decibels on Friday when the Eritrean rider Daniel Teklehaimanot emerges wearing the famous polka dot jersey reserved for the King of the Mountains. Teklehaimanot, who won the same classification at the recent Criterium du Dauphine, becomes the first black African to wear a leader's jersey at a grand tour. A breakthrough moment for cycling. He also gave a nice post-race interview. Asked how many people went to his wedding earlier this year, he replied: \"About 3000.\" You can always count Thomas Voeckler for a bit of gurning for the cameras It is pretty much obligatory for Thomas 'darling of the French crowds' Voeckler to launch a doomed solo break at some point during the Tour before gurning away for the cameras to the delight/disgust of cycling fans the world over. Voeckler had, by his standards, a modest little dig on Thursday, attempting to bridge to the breakaway with about 43kms remaining of the sixth stage to Le Havre. He was only out on his own for about 10 mins before he gave up and slipped quietly back to the bunch, but it was more than enough time to send French commentators into meltdown and for his name to trend on Twitter. Job done. Safety before everything Etixx-QuickStep have had a ridiculously eventful Tour so far with two stage wins, two high-profile misses for Mark Cavendish and a fallout between their star sprinter and his team manager Patrick Lefevere. They won the yellow jersey on the cobbles of stage four thanks to a brilliant ride from Tony Martin and now look as if they will lose it because of a crash involving the German time trial machine on stage six. We await an injury update. Perhaps the most bizarre thing to befall the team so far, however, involves their sporting director Davide Bramati who, it emerged, was banned from driving the team car yesterday as punishment for not wearing a seatbelt. Bramati was busted by French police who saw in-car video footage, uploaded by the team, of Bramati celebrating Martin's stage four victory. The video has since been removed from the internet. \"In the heat of the moment I made a mistake. I didn't fasten the seat belt. Lesson learned. It won't happen again. #safetybeforeeverything\" Bramati tweeted. Dowsett will not ride to Paris for the sake of it Alex Dowsett has been in a bad way ever since his crash on stage four, which saw the haemophiliac rider cut his right arm badly enough to need several stitches. Dowsett managed to complete stage five but described it as the hardest day of his professional career. At the start of Thursday's sixth stage, the British time trial champion said he would not continue to Paris unless he could do a job for the team. \"Otherwise I would be a drain on the team's resources,\" he pointed out. \"It wouldn't be fair.\" Follow @telegraphsport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T05:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T00:45:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
