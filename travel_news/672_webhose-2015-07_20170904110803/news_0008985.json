Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nPulling into this unidentified beach we find a couple of homemade swings hanging from coconut trees, a woman making banana pancakes and a bar owner who cranks up the Aussie music when he discovers where we are from.\nMinutes later, as I bob in the ocean and stare up at the cloudless sky (the shot of fiery tequila still burning in my chest) I’m intoxicated by the freedom of having nowhere I need to be. It’s that moment when emotion merges with experience to create a picture-perfect holiday memory. You can’t get that in a brochure.\nThe sun sets over the water as seen from Baba Nest on Sri Panwa resort, Phuket, Thailand. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nThe moment is even more intoxicating because I hadn’t wanted to go out on the boat today. I had to be pried out of my five-star villa at the luxury clifftop resort of Sri Panwa , our home base over the past few days.\nThe resort is set on hectares of jungle on the south-eastern tip of Phuket overlooking one of the most dramatic coastlines in Thailand . And inside the villa — 60m above sea level and surrounded by an infinity pool, with my own butler and steam room — it’s just one indulgent decision after another.\nWill I float on my back in my private pool or recline on the great white expanse of my king bed? Will I lie on my indoor or my outdoor day bed? Will I slip on to the spa-jet bed in my plunge pool or fill my outdoor bath to the brim and take a long soak there instead? Will I shower inside or outside? Do I swim in a bikini or take advantage of the total seclusion and swim in the nude?\nSri Panwa resort, Phuket, Thailand. Pool villa. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nThe villas at Sri Panwa are made for relaxation, whether you are cranking up the music on your Bose speakers and having a private party in your plunge pool and sala, or listening to the early morning calm as you watch the sun rise over the Andaman Sea. Did I mention it has a 300-degree view and you can slip from your bedroom into the pool?\nBut Phuket — famed for its nightclubs and DJs — is where fun lives in Thailand . And while the Go Go bars and Lady Boy shows of crowded Patong may not be for everyone, you can’t come to this part of the world and not experience life outside your tranquil resort hotel. At least not if the hosts at Sri Panwa have anything to do with it.\nReturning from our boat trip we wander up to Baba Nest, the highest point at Sri Panwa — a rooftop oasis with jaw-dropping 360-degree views across Phuket and surrounding islands.\nSitting on the highest point of the south-eastern peninsula, the 45,000sq m lounge and wraparound infinity pool has the same casual but up-market vibe of the rest of the resort. The amazing view has made Baba Nest a drawcard for weddings and marriage proposals.\nLater, after a sushi dinner at Baba IKI Japanese restaurant (one of three restaurants in the resort) we head to the Baba Pool Club — a restaurant, bar, outdoor lounge and club and infinity pool that forms the heart of the resort. For the record “Baba” means “mixed” and is a nod to the many different cultural influences at Sri Panwa and in Phuket.\nTastebuds come alive with classic Thia dishes at Sri Panwa resort, Phuket, Thailand. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nThe glass wall in the 25m infinity lap pool allows guests to gaze through at the ocean below but we are too full to swim, so we sink on to one of the sunken pool beds surrounded by reflection pools and drink away the evening under the stars.\nSri Panwa is a family-owned resort run by businessman Songkran Issara’s energetic son Vara “Wan” Vorasit and his young and enthusiastic staff. The resort has played host to hip celebrity guests such as Snoop Lion, Flo Rida and Rita Ora and, while it has a well-earned reputation as a funky, young destination, it does its utmost to maintain peace and harmony.\nWan’s personal touch is everywhere, from the rocking chairs at each dinner table (hard to imagine eating any other way after you have gently rocked your way through a meal) to the playlists thoughtfully loaded on iPods in every villa and, most importantly, the helpful staff.\nThai born but educated in the UK, the US and Switzerland, Wan has stacked his hotel with similarly minded young staff.\nSri Panwa resort in Phuket does its utmost to maintain peace and harmony. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nWan’s fun-loving style of management and his approach to life emerges when he arrives to help us during our Thai cooking class. As I learn how to make Thai classics such as Pad Thai and Tom Yum Goong, Wan urges me to “add more”. More salt, more sugar, more lime. More of everything.\nSri Panwa resort is perched on the edge of the idyllic ocean. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nThe result of Wan’s “add more” approach is a hotel both luxurious and hip, where you are helpless to resist the lure of fun. You could come to Sri Panwa for a week and do nothing else except move from your villa to the pool club and down to the private beach. Walk along the jetty or kayak or snorkel out from the beach. Take a Thai boxing class or wander up to the spa near Baba Nest for a bespoke scrub made from seasonal local ingredients such as papaya, mango and tamarind.\nBut watch out. Despite the best-laid plans to lounge on the day bed or read a book in the sun, before you know it you may be doing shots on the beach in the late afternoon sun.\nMore: sripanwa.com\nNATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC TRAVELLER", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227435/242563-66e53636-248c-11e5-9034-065db1ff92dd.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227435/241870-74396528-248c-11e5-9034-065db1ff92dd.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227435/242609-60c8d474-248c-11e5-9034-065db1ff92dd.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227435/242779-5dc02962-248c-11e5-9034-065db1ff92dd.jpg", "http://www.smartraveller.gov.au/zw-cgi/view/Advice/Thailand", "http://www.sripanwa.com/index.html", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227435/242982-77c530b4-248c-11e5-9034-065db1ff92dd.jpg", "http://www.phuket.com/#promo", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227435/241698-720116c0-248c-11e5-9034-065db1ff92dd.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T09:12:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
