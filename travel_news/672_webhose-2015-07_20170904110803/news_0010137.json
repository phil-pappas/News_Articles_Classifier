Try and make it relevant to the area it's in and engage with the local community.\n\"From an operator perspective by changing certain things in the property it does not change the brand.\n\"I've had several travellers where I contracted a supplier that I thought was the supplier of the bricks and mortar that had contracted to someone else. If you don’t have the inventory it's okay tell me. I wouldn't go to Hilton property and expect them to take a Marriott hotel room and turn it into a Hilton.\"\nJacobsen also urged the serviced apartment industry to be more engaged with the buyer community and look at different partnerships to attract a larger customer base.\n\"Suppliers and operators in this space talk among themselves as one big happy family and nobody comes to us buyers and asks what are we looking for and what our needs are.\n\"Affiliations are great - airlines have been doing it for years but in alliances, such as One World and Star Alliance but they all have their own brands, they all have their own contracts, we don’t go in and contract with OneWorld.\nHe added: \"So I'm for affiliations and partnerships to reach a larger audience but what I'm opposed to is that you're not partnering outside your own box…you need to broaden your horizons.\"\nBuying Business Travel is media partner to the Serviced Apartment Summit.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-07-09T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T10:34:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
