Bushmans Kloof Wilderness Reserve & Wellness Retreat is the main sponsor of the 17 talented youngsters (between the ages of 13 and 19), who recently danced their way to victory at the South African Championships of Performing Arts for the second consecutive year. Bushmans Kloof's Deputy General Manager and Executive Chef Floris Smith is the creative force behind the success of the group. A trained dancer and choreographer himself, he devotes his spare time to train and choreograph his \"Trappers\" with whom he has been working since 2012. They are currently polishing the repertoire for their performance at the World Championships as part of \"Team South Africa.\" Members of the Riel dance troupe come from the rural community of Wupperthal and other small towns in the area, and include two teenagers who live on site at Bushmans Kloof where their parents are employed. Born out of traditional Khoi and San ceremonial dances around the fire, the Riel Dance has been practiced by descendants of these indigenous cultures for many years. Riel dancers are dressed typically in traditional farm workers outfits, the girls in dresses with aprons and old frontier bonnets, and the boys in waistcoats and hats adorned with feathers, finished with the famous, hand-made red veldskoene from Wupperthal. This traditional dance form is recognized as a creative cultural expression, and includes courtship rituals, mimicking typical animal antics along with lots of bravado, showmanship and foot stomping. At the recent South African Performing Arts Championships in Rustenburg, Die Nuwe Graskoue Trappers walked away with the Grand Champion Award for \"Best Group Performance.\" They also won in three categories: \"Ethnic Folk\" dancing Riel, \"Open Large Group\" for their Riel Tap routine, and \"Open Small Group\" for their Gumboot routine. Their equally talented Riel band, who will be accompanying the dancers to America, won the Overall Trophy Award for the \"Original\" category and took the Gold medal in both the \"Open\" and the \"Original\" categories. Smith has unwavering faith in the ability of this group of dancers and is proud to take them to the world stage to compete among the best of the best. \"Our sights are firmly set on bringing back the Gold from the World Championships of Performing Arts. We have been hard at work sourcing the funding to get our young dancers there and back, and the support from small and large businessesand the local community has been phenomenal.\" Apart from Bushmans Kloof and its owners the Tollman family, other major sponsors include Rooibos Limited, WESGRO and Reagola IT Management.
