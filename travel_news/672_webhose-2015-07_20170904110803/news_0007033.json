The rest of the band had gone through so I couldn’t give them any of the clothes. I was told I’d either have to pay a £45 fee to get it on the plane, get the flight the next morning, bin the clothes or wear them.” \nSo he wore them, making himself so sick he required treatment from an off-duty paramedic who was on the flight. “I thought I was a goner and that I was having a heart attack,” said James, who survives to record new material along with his band Rewind.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T05:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T21:33:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
