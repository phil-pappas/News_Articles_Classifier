These are some of New Zealand’s most beautiful wilderness locations, a variety of unique environments that will help inspire real-life Robinson Crusoe adventures.\nEach island comes with its own charm, some with basic setups, others boasting luxury accommodation. An island getaway in New Zealand is the perfect way to see some of the country’s rarest wildlife, taste the best wine and escape the hustle and bustle of the mainland.\nArapawa Homestead\nThe Marlborough Sounds, on the north east tip of the South Island, is famous for its sauvignon blanc and lovely scenery. Marlborough is holiday heaven where a temperate climate and vast, unspoilt wilderness lay grounds for indulgence and adventure.\nOne of Marlborough’s best kept secrets is the secluded Arapawa Island which sits at the entrance of Cook Strait, the body of water separating the North and South Islands.\nArapawa has plenty to offer visitors. The white sand of Whekenui Bay is the perfect spot to relax and swim and chances are you will be able to spot dolphins from the shoreline. Long hikes around the island will delight the more adventurous walkers as well as mountain bikers who will be rewarded with incredible views.\nThe island was used a base for whaling from the early 1800s and remnants of the old whaling station still remain.\nAccommodation is available at the Arapawa Homestead in three options. The large homestead is the original house built in 1945 and sleeps up to 14 people. The building has been refurbished in keeping with its 1940s character. The Teacher’s Hut, which is really the old woolshed, sleeps three and comes with beautiful views of Whekenui Bay. The School Cottage, a remodelled version of the school house that the whalers sent their children to, sleeps six and is only a short walk to the beach.\nSource:-New Zealand\nRelated Posts Hiking Through Paradise Prince Harry enjoys New Zealand island escape Chelsea Football Club Hosts Leaders Sport Summit 2013, the world’s most Prestigious Sport Business Summit Destination NSW Regional Manager UK And Germany Appointed Are redundancies ‘a normal part of business’?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T06:10:11.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
