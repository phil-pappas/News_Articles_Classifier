The event, now in its sixth year, provides a great networking opportunity and a terrific golf day for businesses in all kinds of sectors. It was the brainchild of Andy Lee, a former Saracens fly-half who retired from rugby in 2000. Now the managing director of Sportingclass, a leading sports events, hospitality and consultancy company, Lee knows how beneficial it can be to get business people together on a golf course. There are 10 qualifying events this year, each offering a place in the final, which takes place in October at the Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort, Naples, located in Florida. Charitable side Last week, there was a first when the Srixon Industry Invitational joined forces with a charity at one of its qualifying tournaments. The N2S IT & Communications Golf Challenge took place on Friday at The Grove in Hertfordshire. One of the directors of N2S is Andy Gomarsall, the former England scrum-half, who is a trustee of School of Hard Knocks, the social inclusion charity that uses sport to tackle issues surrounding unemployment, antisocial behaviour, crime and health. Sport is a great way to get people to interact and believe in themselves Gomarsall, whose N2S team won last year’s final, persuaded Lee to help out. “Andy’s been part of our event for years and he asked if we could do something to help his charity,” Lee said. “Sport is a great way to get people to interact and believe in themselves. We were delighted to help and raise some money on the day.” Final chances Four more golfers will earn a place in the Florida final when the Home House Open takes place at Stoke Park in Buckinghamshire. Home House is a private members’ club, whose “home” is three adjoining historic townhouses in London’s Portman Square. The club’s place in The Srixon Industry Invitational has gone from strength to strength in recent years. “We’re always looking for new people to partner with,” Lee said. “Home House has a very good database of top-end CEOs, MDs and well-connected people who use the place. “We were looking to grow the tournament and they had their own golf day and we decided that we would do a joint day and help them to grow it. “When we started they had eight teams and today they have got 18.” On September 17, the Srixon Invitational qualifying event takes place, one day before the 2015 Rugby World Cup kicks off with the match between England and Fiji at Twickenham. Srixon, the leading golf equipment manufacturer, is the main sponsor of the Industry Invitational and Richard Hill, the former England forward who was a team-mate of Lee’s at Saracens, is taking part in the Srixon day. A Rugby World Cup winner is sure to inspire the golfers.
