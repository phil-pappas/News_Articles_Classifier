And while he discovered the genetic roots of money in the Galapagos , it was in China where he learned about the introduction of soft, or paper, money. \nAccording to Sehgal, China invented paper money probably around the 9th century AD, but the idea really took off in the 13th century when Kublai Khan and the Mongols came to power. In their quest to rule the world, the Mongols circulated paper money initially backed by silver and silk. Over time, however, they became over-reliant on it, eventually leading to their ruin. \"They printed too much of it and they started to cut that link between money and metal,\" said Khan. \"There is a currency crisis , a monetary crisis, a financial crisis. Eventually that part of the Mongolian empire collapsed. There are lessons in that for us today.\" As for the modern day paper money debate here in the U.S. to replace Alexander Hamilton's portrait on the $10 bill, Sehgal said he supports the decision of United States Treasurer Rosa Rios to have the man who served as the nation's first Secretary of the Treasury to be pushed aside to make room for the likenesses of Rosa Parks or Grace Hopper. \"He is still going to be there, but they are going to be looking at which women to put on the $10 bill,\" said Sehgal, adding that he helped consult with Rios on the decision. Regarding perhaps the oldest metal currency in the world, Sehgal said there is no \"logical\" reason to own gold other than \"tradition\" because there is not a \"use-case for it\". When it comes to bitcoin , Sehgal said the newest money on the scene is impressive and has its applications, but won't be replacing cash anytime soon. Bitcoins biggest use right now, in his estimation, is helping foreign workers send money home without paying a large percentage to traditional money transfer agencies. \"Bitcoin is going to be more successful in the short run in emerging markets than here at home in developing countries,\" said Sehgal.
