Designer Alex Sutton thinks so...\nThese designs show how planes would take off and land on runways erected in the city centre\nThe proposal is for a Stockholm of the future and takes aviation into the inner workings of a busy urban development. Runways reach out over rooftops, with commuters theoretically finding airport travel easier and quicker.\nTerminals, runways and huge baggage portals fit in and around everyday working life, office and buildings, the proposal claims.\n 2 Next Ryanair asks court to halt 'illegal' strike by baggage...

'Travel demand in the aviation industry is set to double by 2030 and continue increasing into the future,' said Mr Sutton, who proposed the designs as part of his final year at The Bartlett School of Architecture in London.\n'Stockholm is used as a testing ground to develop an airport as part of a new city district. Design solutions, generated in response to aviation research, suggest how a new design approach to airport design can be achieved.\nThe runways would be integrated into the metropolis, with planes only using their engines on take off and landing\nThe terminals may look complex, but passengers would be helped along by a series of transporter pods\n'This creates a fully integrated urban airport, with airport systems joining city systems as part of the city's infrastructure, including a micro-terminal and shorter runways to slot into the urban context.\n'Through such mechanisms it is possible that airports may operate within a city on a more environmentally friendly level. The wonder of flight is immersed within the heart of the city.'\nThe proposal was developed as part of Unit 16 at the Bartlett School of Architecture in London. Students were asked to create a Utopian dream and then work out the ways in which it could be implemented.\nIn the design elevated taxi systems move the planes around the terminals, and the aircraft would be able to take off and land from a number of runways. There would also be no need to have engines on until take off as they are transported on a taxi-track system, thus reducing noise and emissions.\nPods would transport passengers to their terminals and gates, as well as to luggage collection points.\nAnd of course the system would be compatible with mobile technology - passengers would be able to use their phones to make sure their luggage came directly to them as oppose to wasting time and effort walking to it themselves.\nWill these next-gen robots be part of Alex Sutton's plan? more videos 1 2 3 4 Watch video Appalling video of bullies forcing girls to their knees\nWatch video Post workout footage shows intense rippling calf cramp\nWatch video Watch SNP MP Mhairi Black's rousing maiden speech in full\nWatch video Blue Angels fly by sends tents & umbrellas flying into air\nWatch video How to speak Aussie : Abbreviate Everything\nWatch video Shocking moment child executes ISIS captive\nWatch video Surveillance footage shows moment of El Chapo's escape\nWatch video Mexico's Attorney General tours site of Guzman escape\nWatch video Video reveals El Chapo's motorbike on rails and escape...\nWatch video Shocking moment driver is confronted for watching TV\nWatch video German court finds 'Bookkeeper of Auschwitz' Groening guilty\nWatch video Incredible trick shots performed by little girl Riley\nThe idea is that journey to and from the airport in the future would be easy as it would be integrated with everyday life\nSpeaking to Dezeen.com , Sutton added: 'Digital developments such as personal digital bag tags, pre-prepared remotely from the airport, allow passengers to effectively drop-and-go.'\n'The system then uses the digital information to take the bag directly to the relevant aircraft gate, where it will be automatically sorted and loaded onto the aircraft.'\nStockholm's traditional affinity with waterways and rivers would be maintained, and there would also be cycle routes around the terminals.\nRead more: Bartlett graduate's elevated Stockholm airport proposal", "external_links": ["http://www.dezeen.com/2015/07/13/stockholm-airport-conceptual-proposal-elevates-runways-among-rooftops-bartlett-alex-sutton-graduate-shows-2015/", "http://dailym.ai/1M9Nc3I"], "published": "2015-07-15T14:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T15:34:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
