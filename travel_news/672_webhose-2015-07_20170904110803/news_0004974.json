Having spotted some incredibly cheap flights with Sri Lankan Airways I made a spontaneous (read drunk) decision to book return flights to Chennai in December (Â£370 return!!!!). I'm now left with deciding what to do? I've visited TN back in 2008 but never made it to Ooty or Madurai which are both on the list but both quite far away from Chennai when I've seen most things in between the two. So I'm tossing up between just spending 2 weeks in the Andamans island hopping or do a week in the Andamans and see some stuff in TN but with some long travel. How amazing is ooty? Any different to seeing Munnar or Shimla or can I skip? And Madurai? Would I be insane to miss the Sri Manakshi temple? Thoughts appreciated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T09:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T12:15:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
