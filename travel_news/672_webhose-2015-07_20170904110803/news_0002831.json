Grand Cayman’s Seven Mile Beach. Picture: Chris J Source: Flickr \nPOLICE in the Cayman Islands say scuba divers have found a cement block with attached handcuffs sitting on the sea floor just off the British Caribbean territory. \nThe Royal Cayman Islands Police Service says the purpose of the heavy block with the handcuffs “is undetermined at this time”. \nThe statement says one handcuff ring is attached to a metal bar fixed to the block while the other is attached to a jagged piece of metal. \nDivers made the discovery in waters off Grand Cayman’s Seven Mile Beach. That’s the small UK territory’s main tourist strip. \nThe Cayman Islands are vulnerable as a drug transhipment point located along maritime smuggling routes between South America and North America.
