These adventurous excursions can be booked by advanced hikers as an alternative to classic shore trips in regions with fascinating landscapes, such as Norway or the Canary Islands. \n\n\nWith a bus or directly at the ship passengers start their trip from sea level to the hike trailheads where a guide leads them up to often breathtaking heights. The experienced guides safely take guests along remote mountain trails with stops at various stations and share information on geology, flora, and fauna. Along the way, guests can enjoy the stunning views and rest up for the next part of their hiking tour. Physical fitness, hiking shoes, and weatherproof clothing are required. AIDA provides telescopic trekking poles, backpacks, water bottles with isotonic beverages, and energy bars. \n\n\nAmazing natural wonders up north await those hungry for adventure in the 2015 summer season, for example at the Geirangerfjord. Guests can explore the land of the trolls in Åndalsnes and marvel at a spectacular landscape with majestic glaciers and powerful waterfalls in Eidfjord. The hiking program will be offered on AIDAluna and AIDAsol this summer. \n\n\nIn the 2015/2016 winter season, hiking will be offered on the Canary Island cruises with AIDAblu and AIDAsol, for example in Tenerife, La Palma, and Madeira. On the island of flowers in the Atlantic, cruise passengers leave the lookout point Eira do Serrado to hike along the highest mountains on the island. The hike then leads down to the Valley of the Nuns and, after a rest in the rustic Curral das Freiras, along a ridgeway up to Boca dos Namorados at an altitude of around 1,000 meters. Back on board, guests can relieve their sore muscles with rejuvenating body and beauty treatments in the Wellness Oasis, the sauna area, or in a yoga course.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T10:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T13:07:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
