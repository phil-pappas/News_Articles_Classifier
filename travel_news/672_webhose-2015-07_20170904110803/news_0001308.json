It’s an exhilarating trip on one of America’s best known waterways. The Hudson River stretches a full 150 miles from the Atlantic Ocean to the Adirondacks, but the Hudson Highlands, just 50 miles from Manhattan, are the most scenic.\nThe Pride of the Hudson and the River Rose both offer fascinating narrated cruises through the Highlands, taking you past the commanding granite buildings of the U.S. Military Academy. Discover why Storm King Mountain is the birthplace of the environmental movement in the United States, and what the haunting Scottish ruins are on Bannerman Island. River villages spill down to the shore from the surrounding mountains, their own tales woven into the history of this historic river, stories that mesmerize all guests onboard.\nThe River Rose is the Southern charmer, plying the river’s waters with its authentic stern-driven Mississippi paddle wheel. The décor is pure New Orleans, with upper and lower decks that would delight a riverboat gambler.\nThe Pride of the Hudson is a sleek, modern boat with air-conditioned main salon where wrap-around windows open up the view. For those who prefer the open air, there’s a spacious sundeck topside or cozy foredeck.\nBoth boats have snack service and fully stocked bars. In addition to the two-hour sightseeing cruises, dinner and brunch cruises are frequently on the schedule. Weddings, corporate events, reunions, and other private charters are handsomely accommodated amid the backdrop of some of the most beautiful scenery in America.\nCruises continue through the glorious fall foliage season to the end of October.\nRelated Posts Amawaterways New VisitScotland data reveals regional visitor trends for 2012 Cruise Industry to Lead Event in recognition of National Day of Service Amawaterways Wins Second Consecutive Virtuoso Supplier Award For “Best River Cruise Line”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T03:14:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
