Tourism is the strongest column of our economy and we do our best to support it.” \n\n“We never heard of any incident with tourists, or any problems with supplies,” assures Panagiotopoulos, disputing the UK travel advisory which encourages holiday-makers to bring sufficient supplies with them for the duration of their trip to Greece. \n\nA full list of Responsible Travel’s own travel advisory to Greece can be viewed on their website here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T16:40:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
