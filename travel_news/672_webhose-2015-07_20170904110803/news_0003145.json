Farmhouse Inn not only earned a #2 ranking among Small Inns in the U.S. , but also ranked 8th on the 100 World’s Best Hotels list. That’s truly rarefied air, and it speaks to the elite experience enjoyed by guests. Not only that, but 2015 marks the third year in which Farmhouse Inn has achieved a ranking. \nThe hotel was also recently selected as the Best Wine Country Hotel/Resort in Sunset Magazine’s 2015 Travel Awards this June. The award honors the West’s top destinations and those displaying excellence in the tourism industry. \nFarmhouse Inn is thanking and including their guests in the celebration with a special invitation to visit wine country; their “Free Tuesday” special runs through the end of September. Any minimum 3 night stays that include a Tuesday in a Premium King room – Tuesday is free (a savings of up to $1195 )! And arriving guests are greeted with a glass of sparkling or wine. \nGuests quickly fall in love with the inn after the first visit—which explains the high praise bestowed by Travel + Leisure readers. The mission of this unique inn is simple: to provide an authentic, “insider” experience of California Wine Country. Hidden treasures abound in this large and diverse region, just an hour’s drive north of San Francisco . Through connections with local vintners and an intimate knowledge of the community, guests can expect a one-of-a-kind experience every time. \nThe passion of sibling owners, Joe and Catherine Bartolomei , comes through in a myriad of little details, like the farm fresh eggs on the breakfast table. As fifth-generation Sonomans, the Bartolomeis have deep roots in the community. \n\n“Our goal here at Farmhouse Inn has always been to create a unique and vital Sonoma wine country experience. This last year we added nine new luxurious rooms, a completely new spa building, and complete revamped all outdoor spaces while maintaining the luxury and attention to detail the staff is known for. Our guests can see and feel the love that has gone into our intimate boutique hotel; that’s how we’ve created such a sense of loyalty with many of our guests returning time and time again,” said owner Catherine Bartolomei . “The recent accolades from Travel + Leisure and Sunset Magazine are just more evidence that we’re doing something quite special. Please come celebrate with us.” \nTravel + Leisure readers rated hotels and accommodations on five criteria: rooms/facilities, location, service, restaurants/food and value.
