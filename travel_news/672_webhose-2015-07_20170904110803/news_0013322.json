Orlando Magic DisneyQuest will be replaced by NBA Experience \nOut with virtual reality, in with basketball hoops: DisneyQuest will close next year to make way for an NBA-themed attraction. \nThe five-story center with video and virtual games opened in 1998 at the entertainment district's West Side. The building is a landmark at Downtown Disney, which is undergoing an expansion. Caption My children are eager to get inside Disney Quest and let the games begin.

In an era of smartphone apps, lifelike video games and other interactive attractions, DisneyQuest started to appear dated to many people. \nChris Fouche, 37, of Orlando remembers being \"blown away\" when it first opened. When he took his 5-year-old daughter last year, though, \"wow\" quickly morphed into \"meh.\" \n\"Now it seems really stupid and really cheesy. I have more power in my phone than in that whole building,\" he said. \"But back then, it was a trip.\" 8 \nDisneyQuest's attractions include CyberSpace Mountain, a design-your-own-roller-coaster motion-simulator ride, and Mighty Ducks Pinball Slam, a life-size game in which players stand on a joystick that controls cartoon characters on a screen. DisneyQuest has more-traditional video games too. \nA few weeks ago, the majority of the features were out of order, Buzz Lightyear's AstroBlaster broke down, and most of CyberSpace Mountain's simulators didn't work. \n\"I think they were getting down to fix it up or get rid of it,\" said Matt Roseboom, editor and publisher of Attractions Magazine. \"I think it would have been a huge investment to really do it right just because all those games would need an overhaul or new games brought in.\" \nThe experience is not cheap. One-day tickets cost $47.93 for adults and $41.54 for children. \nStarChild Academy of Apopka got a field-trip rate, but that was still fairly expensive, owner Cindy Zimmermann said. That — plus thedifficulty of reaching anyone by phone and the relatively late opening time — was the reason StarChild stopped taking summer-camp programs there. \n\"The whole thing was too complex for us,\" Zimmermann said. 0 \nDisney has announced other high-profile closings as well. Its Magic of Disney Animation at Disney's Hollywood Studios will close next month. The Richard Petty Driving Experience will shutter in August so the Disney speedway can be razed for more parking. At Hollywood Studios, the Studio Backlot Tour and American Idol Experience have also closed. \nThe company stopped selling its combination annual water-park-DisneyQuest passes Monday. \nUntil it closes, visits to DisneyQuest will still be included in Walt Disney World's premiere theme-park passes. The company did not have details about whether it will substitute any other experiences in the premiere passes once DisneyQuest closes. \nThe Orlando location had a longer run than others The Walt Disney Co. tried building. One in Chicago closed shortly after opening because it didn't live up to the company's expected returns. Plans for another in Philadelphia fell through amid financing problems for a proposed urban entertainment center there. \nEd Chambers, president of the Service Trades Council coalition of Disney unions, said new jobs will be available for DisneyQuest workers. \nThe NBA Experience at Downtown Disney will include high-tech experiences, a restaurant and a store. \n\"It seems like a perfect fit for that kind of restaurant and entertainment center,\" Roseboom said of the building. \"Just the size of it. There's lots of areas in DisneyQuest where you can look over and see down. I can just picture basketball games there people can play on and things like that.\" \nEarlier this year, Disney removed all the redemption counters for video games at DisneyQuest and its hotels. It also closed Tomorrowland Arcade in the Magic Kingdom, placing games from that location into the hotel arcades to replace the ones that issued prizes for points. \nMany thought those moves were related to concerns about not complying with recently changed state laws that banned Internet cafes but also affected other types of games.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T01:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T21:37:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
