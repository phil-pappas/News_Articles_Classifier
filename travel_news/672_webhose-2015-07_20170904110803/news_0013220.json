Rock climbing is one of the most primal outdoor activities. Almost from the age we can walk, we have the urge to climb. As the adventurer George Mallory said when asked why he wanted to attempt the ascent of Mount Everest: “Because it’s there.” It is also a fantastic way to get in shape and experience the best of the great British outdoors. And, most importantly, it’s great fun. So how do I start rock climbing? The easiest way to start is by climbing a custom-made climbing wall indoors. Many local gyms now have climbing walls and it’s easy to find a wall near you by checking out the British Mountaineering Council’s (BMC) directory . You’ll be able to take a taster session, where experienced instructors will show you the ropes (literally) – including how to use the equipment, and the basic hand and foot holds. Once you’ve shown you can use the wall safely, you’ll be allowed free rein to climb… and from there you can proceed to tackle more challenging outdoors ascents. What special equipment will I need to purchase before I start? Before you start… very little. Registered climbing walls will be able to lend or rent you everything you need initially – simply turn up in the sort of clothes you would wear for a gym workout. Once you’ve progressed a little, you might want to think about buying your own specialist climbing shoes, helmet, harness and belay device for the rope. Most climbing walls will be able to give advice on the best shops in your area. Is it dangerous? Let’s be honest – climbing up any wall, man-made or natural, is going to have some inherent danger. But so long as you use the equipment properly, make sure you’re always strapped in, have a climbing buddy with you, have the right kind of shoes and helmet and aren’t foolhardy about the types of ascents you attempt, you should be okay. What will I get out of it? Apart from keeping fit, developing some serious upper (and lower) body strength, learning to push yourself to achieve things you wouldn’t have thought possible, feeling a massive sense of pride when you conquer every ascent and meeting a whole new circle of like-minded friends? Well, there’s always the view from the top, too! How can I find out more? Your first port of call should be the BMC website : it not only has fantastic resources on clubs, climbing walls and activities across the country, but a whole range of instructional and inspirational videos for first-time climbers and experienced hands alike.
