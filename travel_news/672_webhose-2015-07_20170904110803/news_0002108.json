They tend to be twin-tipped, and relatively narrow so they’re light and manoeuvrable for airborne tricks. Top pipe performers carve well up the pipe, pop easily off the vert and stay stable on landing. Pop is also important for big air, especially on take-off, along with swing weight in the air when spinning and stability for landing. For rails and jibbing, skis need to be durable to deal with hard knocks, as well as stable. Park & pipe advanced Best on test Armada AR7 £360 Best for: Strong performance in and out of the park They lead this group for edge hold, high speed, smoothness and versatility. Fun and poppy, they're a good weight for park riding – great for learning rail and jump tricks. They're balanced in the air, and light enough to spin. With similarly shaped tips and tails, they're ideal for riding switch and jibbing. They need a bit of effort in short turns, but can handle choppy off piste. Tech talk Traditionally cambered cap construction with sidewalls underfoot. Wood core strengthened with fibreglass, carbon and kevlar. + Edge hold, high speed, smoothness, versatility – Moguls Lengths: 161, 166, 171, 176, 181 Sidecut: 118/85/108 (171) Radius: 19.5m (171) Best on test Scott Jib £325 Best for: Progressing from smaller to bigger features The Jibs achieve winning scores in low speed, liveliness/responsiveness and groomed piste. Very strong and stable, they steer easily in long and short turns. They ride rails comfortably and are quick to manoeuvre. They're suited to jibbers who want to learn expert rail tricks and progress to bigger jumps. Tech talk Sidewall construction with traditional camber and a wood core. Their unusual sidecut combines curvy sections at the front and back with a straight section in the middle of the ski for precise edge control. They have over-sized edges for extra durability. + Low speed, liveliness/responsiveness, groomed piste – Off piste Lengths: 158, 168, 178, 184 Sidecut: 114/86/108 (178) Radius: 16m/straight/12m Best value Atomic Infamous £400 (including bindings) Best for: Smaller features and indoor jibbing These top the category for moguls, also performing well for short turns, low speed, and liveliness/responsiveness. Very soft, they're good for progressing on indoor slopes. Nimble for rails, they're best suited to performing intricate tricks and jibbing off small features due to their soft flex. Tech talk Cap construction with partial sidewalls underfoot, and a poplar wood core. They have a relatively straight sidecut at tips and tails for predictable landings, and their edges are reinforced for durability when tackling rails and boxes. Rockered 15 per cent at both tips and tails. + Short turns, low speed, liveliness/responsiveness, moguls – Off piste Lengths: 151, 161, 171, 176, 181 Sidecut: 117/86/117 (176) Radius: 20.5m/18.5m/20.5m (176) Park & pipe expert Best on test Best value Salomon NFX £425 Best for: Smooth rotations and strong landings The NFXs lead the group for edge hold, short turns, high speed, versatility and groomed piste. Very stable and easy to control and carve with, they're great for park riders. Not too stiff, they're flexy and versatile. They're well balanced so rotations feel smooth, plus they are strong and feel great on landings. Tech talk Sidewall construction with a wood core and traditional camber. The edges are extra wide for durability, and there are two layers of rubber elastomer inserted at the tips, tails and underfoot to absorb impact. + Edge hold, short turns, high speed, versatility, groomed piste – Off piste Lengths: 160, 170, 176, 182 Sidecut: 122/86/115 (176) Radius: 17.2m (176) • Ski test winners: On-piste skis • Ski test winners: All-mountain skis • Ski test winners: Freeride skis • Ski test winners: Big mountain skis • Ski test winners: Hike & ride skis Follow @telegraphtravel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T22:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T17:55:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
