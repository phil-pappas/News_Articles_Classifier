Parker’s letter said American’s capacity has grown faster than demand in recent years, leading to fares actually falling. The CEO went on to tell employees that the airline does not know what prompted the investigation but speculates that it could be recent public comments about aircraft capacity. Parker and other airline chief executives discussed capacity — limiting flights and seats — at a meeting of the International Air Transport Association in early June in Miami. Parker said the airlines had learned from past price wars that increasing capacity too fast can lead to lower ticket prices and slimmer profit margins. Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines and Chicago-based United Airlines are also part of the Justice Department investigation into “possible unlawful coordination.” Supporters of the collusion probe say the four largest U.S. carriers now control 80 percent of the market. They note that airline fares didn’t change much even when jet fuel prices dropped by 24 percent last year and that every flight seems booked to capacity to the point of passenger discomfort. Airline officials, including Parker, have countered that they have a duty to maximize capacity to maximize profits for shareholders. The investigation came about two weeks after Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal wrote to the Justice Department asking for a probe of possible collusion. To prove that U.S. airlines actually colluded, the Justice Department must show that the airlines illegally communicated with the intent to reduce competition, and that the illegal communications had the desired effect. \nWant Dallas Legal Services news in your inbox?
