EAST RUTHERFORD — A man was seriously injured after his car crossed over the median of Route 3, flipped over and crashed Tuesday morning in what became a five-vehicle accident, police said.\nThe driver, a 19-year-old from Jersey City who police did not identify, was taken by helicopter to Hackensack University Medical Center with severe lower body injuries, but no one else was hurt, said East Rutherford Deputy Chief Ed Bury.\nThe man lost control of his Toyota Camry in the westbound lanes of the highway before crossing the grass median and striking a metal divider, Bury said. The Camry then flipped over into eastbound traffic and hit another car, which caused a chain reaction accident with three other vehicles, including a tractor trailer, he said.\nPolice found the engine of the Camry in the westbound lanes, which apparently catapulted from the vehicle in the crash, Bury said. The engine did not strike anyone.\nIt’s not clear what caused the man to lose control of his car, police said. The driver told police he was struck by a vehicle when he was driving west, but investigators did not see any damage to the Camry to back up the explanation, Bury said. The Camry was totaled in the crash.\nAfter the accident, all of the highway’s eastbound lanes had been closed to traffic, causing upwards of 35 minute delays from the stadium to the Lincoln Tunnel. There were also delays on the westbound highway, which was closed except for the right lane. All lanes have since reopened.\nThe accident was reported at about 6:30 a.m.", "external_links": ["http://northjersey.mycapture.com/mycapture/lookup.asp?originalname=MC_crash.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-14T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T23:12:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
