Outbound high-occupancy and toll vehicle lanes on Interstate 45 North, U.S. Highway 290 and U.S. 59 South will be limited to two or more riders from 4:30 to 6 p.m. Currently, HOV lanes requiring two or more passengers begin at 5 p.m. and run until 6 p.m. This means no single-occupancy vehicles will be allowed to use HOV lanes during these new times. Check out the Metro map below to get more information on the routes. The move is an effort to ease congestion in the lanes during peak travel times, according to a statement. Some of Houston's suburbs with the worst commutes are along these highways, and congestion has become the biggest problem for Houstonians over the past couple of years. At the beginning of 2015, Houston's Grand Parkway saw its tolls increase slightly . In addition, an expected toll increase for Interstate 10 was suspended in May to allow authorities to explore additional options for reducing congestion on the heavily traveled highway. \nWant Houston Travel   Business Pulse", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T03:02:33.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
