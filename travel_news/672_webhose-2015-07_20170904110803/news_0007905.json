To celebrate the inaugural year of Fathom, which begins sailing on April 10, 2016 , travel professionals are invited to become Fathom Founder agencies to immediately receive a generous 15 percent commission on all bookings made between now and October 15, 2015 . In addition, the company unveiled a number of group rates and offers for Dominican Republic itineraries that are booked now until October 15, 2015 . Pioneered by Fathom, impact travel offers mindful, purpose-driven activities and programs that enable travelers to make a real impact on the people in the communities they visit - starting with the Dominican Republic in April 2016 and with Cuban cultural exchange itineraries intended to begin May 2016 . Carnival Corporation is in active discussions and plans to work with the appropriate authorities in Cuba so that Cuban approval is granted. This is an exciting moment in travel history as Fathom for the first time combines the convenience of at-sea travel with authentic, long-term systematic impact activities at a scale not seen before. During the 2016 season, travelers will take part in the first wave of an ongoing Fathom impact experience to help facilitate and sustain educational, environmental and economic development programs to meet the needs of communities along the northern coast in the Dominican Republic . In Cuba , Fathom intends to operate travel itineraries for the purpose of providing cultural, artistic, faith-based and humanitarian exchanges between American and Cuban citizens. \"The audience for this type of travel is big, growing and passionate, but opportunities to book impact travel experiences are limited, as well as hard to identify, piece together and schedule,\" said David Drier , vice president, sales for Fathom. \"Fathom makes the experience easy, safe, convenient - and most importantly, rewarding and meaningful for both the travelers and the communities they visit. \"Research indicates that nearly 40 percent of the individuals who will book a social impact trip on Fathom might otherwise never have chosen to cruise. We believe Fathom may open up an entirely new potential revenue stream for travel professionals.\" Attractive Offers & Incentives Available for a Limited Time To help travel professionals and group travel planners capitalize on this new and growing market of social impact travelers, Fathom has opened for booking its lineup of 2016 social impact travel itineraries. Highlights of Fathom offerings for travel professionals and group travel planners include: Between now and October 15, 2015 , take advantage of a simple 15 percent commission of base fare on all bookings during this time period. To qualify for the 15 percent commission, join the growing number of Fathom Founder's Circle honorary member agencies by visiting www.Fathom.org and clicking FOUNDER. Additional details regarding the benefits of membership in the Fathom Founder's Circle will be available in fall 2015; to qualify, at least one booking must be under deposit by October 15, 2015 . Book travelers on a 14-night Dominican Republic and Cuba combination back-to-back departures and receive a 10 percent discount off the cruise fare for each departure. Act soon to secure group allocations with Fathom and to take advantage of special group booking incentives, including a number of opportunities to enhance the value of the bookings as well as personalize the group offer. Group pricing and policies are available for both the Dominican Republic and Cuba departures and include: A $25 bonus commission per traveler for the first and second traveler in the cabin for groups blocked by October 15 . A \"1 for 15\" tour escort offer, crediting groups with an average cruise fare (excluding NCF and TF&PE) for every 15 double or single occupancy paid travelers booked within a group (credit applied against the 16 th traveler). Maximum of eight tour escort credits per group. A $50 USD per-traveler shipboard credit for first and second traveler in an interior or ocean view stateroom; or a $100 USD per-traveler shipboard credit for first and second travelers in a balcony stateroom or a suite. For the Dominican Republic only, an enhanced tour escort credit promotion is available for Dominican Republic itineraries, providing a \"1 for 9\" tour escort ratio for groups blocked by Oct. 15 (credit applied toward the tenth traveler). Simplified Pricing Structure Streamlines Fathom Booking Process Similar to its goal of making impact travel experiences easy for travelers, Fathom ensured a simplified fare structure to make it easier for travel professionals to market and sell the Fathom experience. The simplified pricing structure is based on travel professional, group travel planner and consumer feedback, indicating traditional cruise line fare structures are too complicated and make it difficult to book travel. 1 of 4", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T16:00:59.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
