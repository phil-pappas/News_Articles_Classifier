Lawrence stayed in 1917. \nLike other buildings in the district, which also includes centuries-old mosques, it fell into disrepair before the quarter's Unesco listing began to spark a revival. \nSami Nawar, head of the historic area known to residents as Al-Balad, said several prominent families are among those who have reconstructed homes at their own expense, and more than 700 restoration licences have been granted over the last five years. \nTourism and finance ministry officials are looking at how to help other owners fund their renovations, possibly through loans, Nawar said. \nRare traditional architecture \nIn its decision last year, Unesco noted the importance of the \"reduction of the rate of decay of the historic houses, which are often abandoned and squatted (in) by poor immigrants\". \nWhile warning \"negative development\" could jeopardise the area's character, it foresaw \"a new virtuous circle\" thanks to renovation projects and involvement of homeowners and merchants, like Maha Baeshn. \nBaeshn, an artist and poet, said the Ramadan festival encouraged her and other homeowners to take better care of their properties. \n\"The Jeddah festival brought life to the houses and the area,\" she said. \nThe homes, some of them rising multiple storeys, are built of rock and wood, with decorated facades and large bay windows known as rawashin to help air circulate. This has the added benefit of creating cooling shadows for people outside. \nUnesco said the design and function of the homes reflected their adaptation to the humid local climate and to Jeddah's prominence as a trading and religious centre. \nThey also include ground floor offices and commercial outlets, and rooms rented for pilgrims. \nOnly \"scant vestiges\" of this Red Sea architectural tradition survive outside of Saudi Arabia, Unesco said. \nA sweet history \nAlong alleys between the houses, the Ramadan festival features about 80 shops and stalls and a dozen restaurants -- all usually staffed by locals -- representing traditional trades and delicacies from the coastal Hejaz region around Jeddah. \n\"We have been running this business as a family for almost 150 years, and this is considered one of the oldest professions in the kingdom,\" Samir Jastania said at his popular shop selling Hejazi sweets. \nAnother vendor offers appetisers, pickles and traditional spices that reflect the cosmopolitan history of Jeddah, a city considered relatively liberal in Saudi Arabia, where a severe version of Islam is practised. \n\"What makes me happy is that the people of the area run it all. It's amazing,\" said festival visitor Ali Jazar, 39, sipping a popular Ramadan apricot drink known as gamardeen. \nAlthough this year's Ramadan cultural festival in old Jeddah is not the first, the event has taken on added significance since the Unesco designation. \nWafi said that in its first seven days almost 130,000 people flocked to the festival's open-air markets, games, traditional rituals, foods and literary discussions. \nOne visitor, Osman al-Rosaini, 45, said it is a chance to \"teach my children about their roots\". \nMansour al-Zamil, who owns a gift and memorabilia shop, says Ramadan is just the start of his commitment to Jeddah's old quarter. \n\"Opening this shop has been my dream since I was a child. I opened it in the historical city and it will be here after the festival is over.\" Tell us what you think about this article Like dislike 0 people liked / 0 people disliked it Share this article", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T10:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T11:49:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
