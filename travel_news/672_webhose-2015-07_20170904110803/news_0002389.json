Last month Playtech, a gambling software company, signed a deal to buy Plus500, a London-listed online contracts for difference broker. \nThe news came as Bwin reported revenue in the three months to June was in line with expectations, and said that mobile “has continued to grow strongly”. \nIt said the proportion of revenue generated by mobile in June rose to 31 per cent, up from 23 per cent in the same period last year. \nMeanwhile the proportion of sales generated by sports betting rose to more than 50 per cent in June, up from 37 per cent in the same month last year despite the fact that last summer sports revenue was boosted by the football World Cup. \nHowever, Bwin said unfavourable sporting results drove margins lower. \nNorbert Teufelberger, chief executive said: “Despite challenging comparatives ... we are pleased with our business performance in the first half. We have completed our new organisational set-up and streamlined our decision-making processes, significantly improving our operational performance.” Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
