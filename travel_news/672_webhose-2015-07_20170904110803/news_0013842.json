If you’re an adrenalin junkie, dive into the thrills category for details on skydiving or sewer touring . If you’re a family man, consider climbing the O2 with your kids or organising a water fight in your garden . And if you’re looking to make new friends (or reconnect with old ones), why not up the stakes and try a street dance class ? (Forty-year-old dad Harry Wallop just about managed it! ) Or maybe push the boat out and try something that’s sure to flourish as a pub anecdote for years to come: footgolf! In the meantime, #WhyNot enter the competition for the chance to try wakeboarding, one of the newest and most exciting water activities in Barcelona? Combining surfing, water skiing and snowboarding, wakeboarding is as thrilling as it is rewarding – and it’s a perfect chance for you to let out your inner surfer dude. This fantastic prize includes return travel and a two-night stay in a bed and breakfast for two people. Simply answer the question below to be in with a chance of winning. Entrants must be aged 18 or over and the competition closes at midnight on Sunday, July 26, 2015.
