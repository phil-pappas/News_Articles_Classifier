It consists of technical workshops, plenary sessions, keynote speakers, networking events and technical visits. \nSpeakers so far include: newly-appointed Warren East, Chief Executive of Rolls-Royce; Tom Enders, CEO, Airbus Group; Johan-Dietrich Wörner, Director General Elect for the European Space Agency; Carlos Moedas the European Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation, and Tony Tyler the Director General and Chief Executive Officer of the International Air Transport Association (IATA). \nCentral to the event will be Europe’s Vision for Aviation, ‘Flightpath 2050’. The European Commission’s initiative – which was launched during Aerodays 2011 – focuses on improving five key areas within the aviation sector: efficient and seamless mobility; competitiveness of industry; greening of aviation; safety and security; and skills for breakthroughs. \nADS Group, the leading trade organisation for UK aerospace sector, hosting Aerodays on behalf of the European Commission, who through their framework programme for research and innovation, has co-funded much of the technology on show at the event.
