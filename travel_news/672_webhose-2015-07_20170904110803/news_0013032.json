But they were later updated and are now no longer on the table as the European part of Greece’s bailout program expired at midnight Tuesday.\nThe head of a top European intergovernmental institution told The Associated Press that holding such a referendum would fall short of international standards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T09:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T14:07:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
