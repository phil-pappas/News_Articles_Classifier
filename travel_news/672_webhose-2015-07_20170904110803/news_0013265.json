Access to Limón via Route 126 in Vara Blanca is also closed due to landslides from last week.\nMOPT and National Roadway Council staff are on site working to remove the debris. Currently the only alternate road available is Route 10 between Turrialba and Siquirres.\nThis is the third closure of Route 32 since heavy rains began affecting the Caribbean region in mid-June.\nThe National Meteorological Institute forecasts heavy rains will continue hitting the area throughout the day and likely into the night. Officials from the National Emergency Commission are calling on the populations of Limón, the eastern part of Cartago province and the northern part of Heredia province to remain alert.", "external_links": ["http://www.mopt.go.cr:10039/wps/portal/Home/inicio/!ut/p/a1/hY_BboJAEIafhltlxpUC9obUgAjVahrXbZoGDSwkwJJllcSndyW9NGl1bjP5vvlngAEF1qTnkqeqFE1a3Xpmf5PxcxD6W4zQtQl6OH2bv4YfxIqJBvYawH_Kw0d-NAB3fB1AZOInHFibqmJUNrkA-rl5ir9gB2zQ_cALLSdGDN6tGS6cZLWcb9wJLuwf4M5-fQCvxGH4de81h4mrk2SWZzKT5knqcaFU270YaGDf9yYXgleZeRS1gX8phegU0N8ktDW9xPl2Xe_c7grCWe-y/dl5/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/"], "published": "2015-07-07T01:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T23:30:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
