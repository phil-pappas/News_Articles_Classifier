It’s a credit to our teams who make our facilities come to life and ensure that our delegates feel welcomed and valued from the moment they step through the door.” Earlier this year the venue won the business tourism category of the VisitEngland Awards 2015. It has also just been awarded a TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence for the third consecutive year, and the venue holds BDRC gold rating – based entirely on the voice of the customer. Last year, Woodland Grange took the title ‘Business of the Year’ at the Pride Awards. “Approximately 40,000 delegates come to Woodland Grange each year, the majority of whom take time to give us very positive feedback,” said David Vaughton. “People come back again and again, which is a tangible indication of satisfaction levels.” Customer care is also driving business development at Woodland Grange, with a 17% increase in incremental mid-year revenue (June 2015) recorded compared to the same period last year.
