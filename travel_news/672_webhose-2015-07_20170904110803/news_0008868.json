More than £300,000 has been invested in Hirst Priory by landlord The Hunt Group and new operator Genex which has taken a 10 year lease on the Grade II listed building. \nHirst Priory, located in the market town of Crowle, was previously used as a private residence before being neglected but was acquired in 2004 by the Hunt Group which secured planning permission for hotel use. It sits in a secluded area overlooking Lincolnshire Golf Course and boasts 18 acres of stunning grounds. The renovation investment has allowed the transformation of the ground floor space to facilitate weddings or events for up to 110 guests with on-site catering kitchens, a fully licensed bar and preparation areas. There is also a licensed ceremony room. Upstairs there are five en-suite bedrooms alongside dedicated rooms for hair, beauty and photography to provide one-stop offering for wedding clients. Genex has plans to expand into the second floor space with meeting rooms for corporate use and has already sub-let space to some of its event suppliers. Outside there are extensive gravel and lawned areas able to host marquee functions for up to 300 guests as well as corporate outdoor pursuits. Hazel Wheatley at Genex said, “We are delighted to present Hirst Priory to market as a wedding and events location. The building is of considerable heritage value to the area as a tourist attraction and is cherished for its beautiful architecture by the local community. “The renovation has been challenging but we have managed to retain the property’s wonderful period features whilst adding modern functionality. The fact that we are offering everything under one roof is quite unique…our clients can hire Hirst Priory exclusively for a number of days and even use our on-site hair, beauty and photography services as part of a complete package. “Corporate clients can also take over the space for conferences and breakout sessions, business lunches or corporate hospitality events. All of the estate is available to hire exclusively.” Hirst Priory is located just five minutes from Junction 2 of the M180 with easy connectivity to the M18, M62, M1 and A1 arterial roads. Crowle train station is five minutes away and both Robin Hood and Humberside passenger airports are located within 30 minutes’ drive time. This year Genex has already successfully delivered six weddings and 15 corporate events with excellent feedback. It has five further weddings and events secured, and expects to build up to 30 bookings in 2016. It has also secured bookings into 2017 and 2018.
