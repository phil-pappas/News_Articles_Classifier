Su Nuraxi di Barumini \nBarumini, in southern Sardinia, is a good example of the Bronze age structures called nuraghi that are unique to the island of Sardinia. This large nuraghic complex also includes a village around the nuraghic tower. The area has been well excavated and Nuragic, Punic, and Roman artifacts have been found there and many of the artifacts can be seen in the Archeological Museum in Cagliari . \nMore about Nuraghi | Su Nuraxi di Barumini Pictures More » 3. Villa Romana del Casale Villa Romana del Casale is a luxurious Roman villa in southern Sicily dating from the fourth century BC. Every room is decorated with mosaics.

Lipari, the largest island, shows evidence of habitation since 4000 BC and was an importantt source of obsidian. Stromboli is the only island that still has an active volcano. The islands are a popular tourist destination in summer, with Lipari having the most hotels. One of the islands was the setting for the movie, Il Postino . Sicily Map showing the islands.

Other Baroque towns include Noto, Modica, and Scicli.
