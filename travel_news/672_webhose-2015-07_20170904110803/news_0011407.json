The plane, called Dream Maker, has covered 4,894 miles. Here in Mexico it’s six hours behind UK time.\nI ought to feel jetlagged... that unwelcome fuzzy feeling you get after a long flight across multiple time zones.\nBut, thanks to travelling in Thomson Airways’ revolutionary jetlag-busting Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner aircraft, I feel pretty good.\nI cannot believe I have just stepped off a nine-hour flight.\nAdmittedly, I won’t make midnight at my hotel on the Riviera Maya as sleep will naturally beckon, but I certainly don’t feel as washed out as usual after a long flight.\nNine hours on TOM518, in the most talked about passenger plane since Concorde, has quite literally flown by.\nThe benefits of this “greener” $193.5million aircraft hit us from the moment we stepped into the light, airy cabin.\nHere, in the back of the Thomson bus, you get a seat pitch of 34in, which is typically 3in more legroom than on Boeing 747 jumbo jets used by popular carriers, such as British Airways and Virgin Atlantic. It makes a huge difference; you can stretch your legs, helped by having no obstacles, such as boxes of video equipment in the way of your feet.\nThomson is the first UK airline to get its hands on Dreamliners; British Airways will offer flights to the USA and Canada with its 787s in two months and Virgin Atlantic starts in 2014.\nBefore Dream Maker’s take-off there were welcomes for the 291 passengers from Thomson Airways boss Chris Browne and Captain Stuart Gruber, one of three pilots taking us down Mexico way. Of course, the Dreamliner has certainly had many teething troubles but Chris told passengers it was a proud moment after waiting nine years from placing the order to delivery.\nCapt Gruber added that the Dreamliner can cruise at up to 640mph (Mach 0.85) – so they could trim a very welcome 90 minutes off a standard aircraft’s 10hr 30min flight time.\nTop 5 Thomson Dreamliner deals right now Constance Belle Mare Plage, Mauritius\nThomson is offering seven night holidays to Mauritius staying at the 4T Blumarine Attitude on an all-inclusive basis from £1,194 per person.

The most apparent is the pleasant amount of light – windows are 30% larger than on other aircraft. This means that even passengers in the seats bang in the middle of the plane can see out to the horizon.\nAnd those windows don’t have blinds as they are electronically dimmable (it’s a bit slow to be honest). The dynamic LED mood lighting in the cabin adjusts throughout the flight to reflect the time of day plus, as Thomson is a leisure airline, they’ve added holiday disco effects, too!\nThe jet has wider aisles and higher ceilings which means when you stand up you aren’t so likely to whack your head on the cavernous luggage bins.\nChanges you’ll feel rather than see include moister air at a lower cabin pressure (5,000ft rather than the typical 8,000ft) so more oxygen can be absorbed into your blood to cut the chance of dehydration and headaches. Plus it’s had irritants, such as perfume and deodorant particles, removed.\nThe physical flight is improved too as Dreamliners are designed to provide a smoother, quieter journey.\nOn take-off from Glasgow last month, after a fabulous Scottish-themed send-off at the gate, Capt Gruber opened the throttles on Dream Maker’s two General Electric GENX engines to unleash 128,000lb of combined thrust. It was a muted roar (good news if you live near an airport) and that was almost drowned out by the passengers’ celebratory round of applause. And in flight, too, there is definitely much less engine noise.\nThe smoothness of the ride is thanks to on-board computers sensing oncoming turbulence and commanding wing control surfaces to counter it immediately. A couple of ripples somewhere west of Ireland and a little lumpiness by the Canadian coast, but that was it; the seat belt signs never came on. Plus, the Dreamliner can cruise higher than normal jets at up to 42,000ft, so it’s able to pass over some types of turbulence.\nTo mark the delivery of the first 787, Thomson created this digital story of flight infographic...\nClick here for full screen version of this infographic\nThe touchscreen Panasonic in-flight entertainment system is pretty good with movies, TV, games, music and journey information. On my unit, though, the sound was irritatingly out of synch with the picture.\nThe food is standard economy fare – a pleasant pasta starter and a main course of chicken in noodles, which was uninspiring but at least piping hot. The chocolate mousse dessert was fine and there’s a good cup of coffee on board. The cabin crew, it must be said, were terrific.\nIt’s a fine looking jet with elegant, sweeping lines and distinctive flexible wings, which rise up to 10ft at the tips on take-off, though it’s perhaps not as awesome close up as the mighty Airbus A380 double-decker superjumbo. Constructed mainly from an incredibly strong carbon-polymer material, it’s much lighter than similar-sized metal aircraft such as the 767 which it is intended to replace.\nAnd since it has no metal plates and rivets there’s considerably less drag too, so it typically uses 20% less fuel, hence its “green” tag. The fuel efficiency also means the 787 offers a tremendous range for its size – up to 9,444 miles, which brings the tantalising prospect of direct flights to destinations such as Bali, Hawaii and even Perth from the UK. Australia in one go. Amazing.\nWhile you can hardly avoid your body being, say, five time zones adrift from UK time if you’re in Florida, the plane’s jetlag-busting features really do seem to combine to help to alleviate the effects of the long flight.\nFellow passengers agreed. Newlyweds Brent and Amanda Cramb, from Stirling, were heading on honeymoon to the Riviera Maya and voted the experience as “brilliant”. Brent, who had never been on a long-haul flight, added: “It’s so quiet... I’ve slept like a baby!”\nWhen we landed in Mexico the passengers seemed raring to start their holidays rather than ready for bed. This is the future of flying – jetlag, you’re pretty much busted.\nBut it was at the back of the aircraft that I discovered its secret weapon for happier flying for female passengers... blokes can’t leave the loo seat up! When you activate the motion sensor for the flush it lowers automatically.\nSo it’s not just a light aircraft in both senses of the word; it’s a polite aircraft, too.\nIt’s not been plane sailing for launch of the 787 The Dreamliner is a technical marvel that’s had a painful birth. After long production delays it went into service in 2011, then in January all 50 in use were grounded after two battery meltdowns.\nFlights resumed in April after Boeing modified battery compartments. Then three weeks ago an Ethiopian Airlines 787 parked at Heathrow suffered fire damage and four airlines have reported minor technical problems. Planes are of course incredibly complicated and new ones do have teething troubles – the Airbus A380 had its share. The Ethiopian incident is linked to a distress beacon made by a third party that has been on thousands of jets since 2005 with no problems.\nAir accident investigators have ordered the component to be temporarily removed on 787s and Boeing has asked airlines to inspect beacons on all jets, not just 787s.\nMeanwhile, 72 Dreamliners are flying with more going into service. Would I get back on one tomorrow? Yes, absolutely.\nBoeing 787 Dreamliner facts Passengers: 210-250\nRange: up to 9,444 miles\nWingspan: 197ft\nLength: 186ft\nHeight: 56ft\nCruise speed: Up to 640mph\nMaximum takeoff weight: 502,500lb\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "http://www.thomson.co.uk/destinations/caribbean/jamaica/jamaica/ocho-rios/hotels/clubhotel-riu-ocho-rios.html", "http://www.thomson.co.uk/destinations/caribbean/dominican-republic/dominican-rep-punta-cana/bavaro/hotels/riu-palace-macao.html", "http://flights.thomson.co.uk/en/index.html", "http://www.thomson.co.uk/destinations/indian-ocean/mauritius/mauritius/anse-la-raie/hotels/blumarine-attitude.html", "http://www.thomson.co.uk/blog/infographic/787/index.html", "http://brightcove.vo.llnwd.net/d21/unsecured/media/4221396001/4221396001_2534363554001_vs-51daddf6e4b09a19c9989135-806787295001.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://twitter.com/DailyMirror", "http://www.thomson.co.uk/destinations/caribbean/mexico/mexico-caribbean-coast/riviera-maya/hotels/grand-sirenis-resort-and-spa.html", "http://www.thomson.co.uk/destinations/caribbean/mexico/mexico-caribbean-coast/cancun/hotels/riu-cancun.html", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTravel", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts"], "published": "2015-07-20T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T20:00:36.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
