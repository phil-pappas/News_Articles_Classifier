The two brands have a combined 19 properties in or near cities. Homewood Suites expects to open an additional dozen properties in metropolitan areas by 2016, and Home2 Suites expects to open another six. Element Hotels said it expected to open more than 20 properties in the United States and Canada by 2018. And at Residence Inn, about 80 hotels expected to open in the next three years will be in urban areas. There is a flip side to the push into cities, though: Once business travelers reach their destinations, they may vie with vacationing families for amenities. On a recent two-night stay at a Residence Inn in downtown Chicago, Richard Lawrence, a title insurance executive, said that when he tried to get breakfast, “there were lots and lots of families, lots and lots of noise and few, if any, tables because of it.” Some say the notion that extended-stay hotels offer the comforts of home for business travelers exists largely in the eyes of hoteliers. Sandi Patterson, an executive at Xerox, said during a recent stay at a Staybridge Suites in Austin, Tex., that the check-in was efficient, but that the wine ran out at the social hour and a staircase door near her room was noisy. “A bed-and-breakfast is much more at home,” she said. “This definitely felt like a hotel stay.” The increase in business traveler patronage at extended-stay hotels has come despite a push by Airbnb to attract the same clientele. About 10 percent of Airbnb’s customers are business travelers who stay an average of seven nights, the company said. But extended-stay hotels have managed to buck the trend, their executives say, by offering consistency. Guests want to be reassured that if there is “a big presentation to important client, if there is any problem along the way, someone is going to help me out,” said Diane Mayer, vice president and global brand manager at Residence Inn. Mr. Jones, the chemical company executive, said he continued to be a fan of the extended-stay hotels. “Business travel is quite complicated on a modest budget with overcrowded planes and driving rental cars in cities you’ve never seen before,” he said. An extended-stay hotel “simplifies business travel, gets rid of the distractions and lets you get a good night’s sleep.” Loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T12:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T12:43:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
