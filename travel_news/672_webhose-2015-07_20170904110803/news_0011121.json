Prague is a beautiful city and any place that is surrounded by water gets a big tick in the box from me. I have been there many times over the years and I can wander comfortably around the city without having to look at a map. It truly is an amazing place given the fact that many historical buildings had to be repaired or rebuilt after the United States mistakenly bombed it at the end of the war. Anything special you should pack? You do need good walking shoes as the streets of Prague are a maze of cobbles. It’s a compact city, best explored on foot. I love taking photographs so I always make sure I take a good camera. I like to take photos of stained-glass windows and that’s why I’m a big fan of St Vitus Cathedral. The north nave of the building has a beautiful window that portrays the Czech patron saint, St Wenceslas. An overview of Prague (Fotolia/AP) What’s the first thing you do when you arrive? If the weather is good, I have a coffee or a Czech beer, like a Budvar, on the terrace of the Four Seasons (+420 221 427 000; fourseasons.com/prague ) . I’m always on the road as a BBC Formula One commentator between March and November, so it’s nice to unwind, sit back and watch the world go by when I get the chance. Where’s the best place to stay? I love staying at the Four Seasons in the Old Town. It has a great location overlooking the Vltava River and is steps from Charles Bridge. The hotel has a new Italian restaurant called CottoCrudo and also serves a fantastic breakfast. Where would you meet friends for a drink? I like the Hemingway Bar (773 974 764; hemingwaybar.cz/bar-prague ). It is tiny but it has a stylish interior and a real buzz about it. It has an extensive cocktail list and the bar staff are great. You can sit at the bar to watch the bartenders make the cocktails with fresh ingredients. Prices are high by Czech standards, but they are around just under £5 a cocktail. The Old Town of Prague (Fotolia/AP) Where is the best place for lunch? You can’t visit Prague without going to Kampa Park (257 532 685; kampagroup.com/en ) . It’s a fantastic restaurant that serves delicious fish and meat dishes and it has a wonderful riverside terrace that overlooks the Charles Bridge. The service and atmosphere are fantastic and I’ve never had a bad meal there. And for dinner? La Finestra (222 325 325; lafinestra.cz/en/uvod/ ) is a great Italian restaurant serving lovely seafood including fresh and tasty fish, linguine with fresh tomato sauce, mozzarella and rocket pesto. It’s the best Italian in Prague. Where would you take a first-time visitor? Prague has a great mix of Gothic, Romanesque, baroque and art nouveau architecture. I like to stroll across Charles Bridge as you can enjoy fantastic views of the city on both sides. Commissioned by King Charles IV and built in the 14th century, it connects the left and right bank of Prague with the Castle sitting high up on the hill. Sometimes it takes a while to cross the bridge as you get caught up watching the street artists and jazz musicians. I also like Prague orloj, a medieval astronomical clock located at the Old Town Hall in Wenceslas Square. The clock was first installed in 1410. It is the world’s third-oldest astronomical clock and only one still working. There are four figures flanking the clock and across it stands a skeleton that strikes the time upon the hour while all the other figures shake their heads. The Charles Bridge (Fotolia/AP) What should I avoid? Maybe steer clear of Wenceslas Square at nights and weekends if you don’t want to see stag parties. What should I bring home? I bought some mosaic drinking glasses when I was last in Prague but they are more decorative than anything. I generally tend to just take home the memories. Public transport or taxi? I am not big on public transport but I have been told that it’s a wonderful way to get around Prague. Personally, I either prefer to drive or be driven, so a taxi is better for me. Wenceslas Square (Fotolia/AP) Manbag or money belt? I travel light so I don’t have a manbag or a money belt. I don’t like to walk around looking like a tourist. I prefer to keep under the radar. Anywhere that isn’t your kind of town? Stuttgart is not a very pretty town but it’s a major business hub. I’ve been several times a year for work over the past 20 years but it’s not visually stimulating or exciting enough for me. David Coulthard is a commentator for the BBC’s Formula One coverage team.
