Additionally, even more flights between Los Angeles and Maui and Kauaʻi have been added from December 2015 to January 2016, offering an increased schedule with more flexibility for holiday travelers.\n“Again this year we are pleased to offer additional service over the peak holiday season to address strong demand for travel to Hawaiʻi,” said Peter Ingram, executive vice president and chief commercial officer at Hawaiian Airlines. “We are also pleased to follow on the success of our summer flights between Los Angeles and Līhuʻe by extending these direct flights beyond the routine seasonal service.”\nHawaiian is currently operating on its summer schedule with four flights weekly between Los Angeles (LAX) and Līhuʻe, Kauaʻi (LIH). During the holiday season, flights will increase to five per week Dec. 18 through Jan. 4.
