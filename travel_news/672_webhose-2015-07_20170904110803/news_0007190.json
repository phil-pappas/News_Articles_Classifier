Vail has some of the best terrain in the world. Source: Supplied \nIF YOU could sum up Vail in one word it would be “bowls”. The biggest ski resort in the United States, it covers over 2000 hectares of skiable terrain including seven legendary back bowls. \nVail is enormous. Bigger than most major ski resorts, its back bowls span around 1200 hectares and its three separate but connected base areas spread over nearly 10 kilometres. \nKnown as the king of American ski resorts, Vail is also one of the world’s best in terms of terrain. Its varied runs spread skiers and boarders across the mountain and its modern lift system, some with heated seats, clears the notorious weekend crowds. \nVail is unique in that it is an entirely purpose built resort. While many North American ski resorts started as mining towns, Vail has its history rooted in the US Army whose Mountain Division wanted to recreate the resort towns they saw in Europe. Vail was modelled on European ski towns. Source: Supplied \nCompleted in 1962, some critics say its purpose-built feel takes away from your typical ski village charm. But the resort has pumped money into the town with heated pathways, shopping, world class restaurants and hotels. \nWhat Vail lacks in charm it makes up for in experience. Top hotels such as The Lodge offer ski valets who deliver and collect your skis each day. On mountain dining includes white table cloths at the 10th where you swap your ski boots for slippers. The famous Chef Nobu Matsuhisa has opened the incredible Matsuhisa restaurant in the village and there’s even a fancy bowling Alley named Bol, with a top restaurant and waiter service for drinks and bar snacks while you play. Dine at The 10th and be greeted with slippers on arrival. Source: Supplied \nIn a quest to please its young party crowd, Vail last year offered a mountain top nightclub experience called Decimo . Sitting at 10,250 feet above sea level, Decimo transforms the Mid-Vail restaurant into a dance party with VIP tables and acts including DJ Paul Oakenfold. With podium dancers and flowing champagne it’s like Vegas in the snow. \nIf a quieter well-deserved beer at the end of the day it what you’re looking for, the appie (apres) scene in Vail has you covered. Head to Vendettas for a slice of pizza or the Red Lion for some live music. \nOr if some pampering after a day on the slopes is more your style, choose from one of the town’s many spas. RockResorts spa at The Lodge is a good start. \nThe beauty of Vail is its access. Just a two-hour drive from Denver or a half an hour drive from the local Eagle Vail airport, it is popular with locals and overseas travellers, especially Australians. \nBut this access doesn’t diminish its beauty. It may lie just off the interstate highway I-70 but you’ll feel a world away from civilisation at the top with incredible views and breathtaking bowls. The incredible China Bowl for powder lovers.
