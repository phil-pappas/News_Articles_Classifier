Yet the numbers are less a reflection of Tom Watson – who has crossed the Atlantic to play his ultimate rounds in the Open – than his belief that golf, like life, was about responsibility, modesty and, perhaps most of all, honesty. His previous trip to St Andrews , 2010, was meant to be his last appearance there. He was 60 and, with so many memories in his and our heads, he paused to kiss the stones on Swilcan Bridge. But five years later, after an invitation from the R&A, Watson and the game will enjoy an encore. We know Tom Watson the golfer, who has won the Open five times and, at the age of 59, nearly a sixth time; who won the Masters twice; who won the US Open. Few know Watson the man, a son of the Midwest, of Missouri, where humility is prized, where one is judged on results. It’s the “Show Me State”, Missouri, because a sceptical Congressman in the 19th century, Willard Vandiver, said of an issue: “I’m from Missouri. You’ve got to show me.” Actions, not talk. Watson once read a story I wrote on Dave Stockton, the Californian golfer, after the 1976 PGA Championship. “I liked it but I never would have told you things like Dave did,” Watson said. Tom Watson has been as good for golf as golf has been for him In the winter of 1968, when he was a freshman at Stanford, Watson was competing in the San Francisco City Amateur at Harding Park and hit an errant shot into the trees on the 10th hole. After he putted out for what presumably was a par, Watson said he had moved the ball accidentally at address, thus took a penalty stroke and lost the hole. No one saw the transgression but Watson was governed by the rules of golf, as well as his conscience. There was only one way to play the game. Watson played it the right way, played it like the champion he became. Success did not come easily to Watson. After an unimpressive career at Stanford, Tom joined the Tour in 1971. He took leads in the 1974 US Open at Winged Foot and the 1975 Open at Medinah but couldn’t hold them. Watson, said his critics, choked under pressure. A month after Medinah, it all changed. In the chill at Carnoustie he beat Jack Newton in an 18-hole play-off for the Open. Watson’s love affair with links golf had begun, as had Britain’s love affair with Watson. It was in the 1977 Open at Turnberry that Watson and Jack Nicklaus tossed birdies at each other in what came to be known as the “Duel in the Sun”. The two best in the sport playing like the two best in the sport and Watson, who relished the battle as much as the outcome, turning to Nicklaus on the 16th tee in the last round, and saying: “This is what it’s all about, isn’t it?” What it was also about was Watson winning by a shot, and Nicklaus throwing his arm around Tom’s shoulder in respect and congratulations. Becoming the oldest Open champion would have been the sports story for the ages In 1982, at Pebble Beach, Watson won a similar duel for the US Open. “That little son of a gun,” was all Nicklaus could say about Watson. Mark Twain, like Watson, was from Missouri, and Watson, with his red hair and gap between his front teeth, was labelled early on as one of Twain’s characters, Huck Finn. But Finn was a bit of a rebel. Watson had a wild streak at university. Now he’s solid establishment. “Golf is a slow game,” Watson said. “And it’s difficult to get the full meaning without taking time.” For sure, we’ve taken the time to appreciate Tom Watson, who has been as good for golf as golf has been for him. Tom Watson is a MasterCard Golf Ambassador My Watson priceless memory For many, the highlight of Watson’s career is his mano-a-mano win over Jack Nicklaus in the 1977 Open at Turnberry. I choose to remember a round that ended very differently, the 2009 Open at the same course. For 71 holes Watson, who was 59, played as if he were 39, or 29. Him becoming the oldest Open champion would have been the sports story for the ages. But, as we know, he flew the green at 18, bogeyed and collapsed in the play-off against Stewart Cink. So sad and yet so enthralling, this man of another generation, refusing to go gently into that good night. Nobody knew what to ask him at the post-match press conference. Finally, Watson said: “This ain’t a funeral, you know.” Indeed, it was a golf tournament never to be forgotten.
