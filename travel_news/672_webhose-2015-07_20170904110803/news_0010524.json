Rooms, cabins, cottages, houses, condos, villas, apartments, RV’s, houseboats, guesthouses, and even tents that are rented by the night are collectively called “vacation rentals.” Renting these private accommodations may be the best vacation decision you’ll ever make. They are affordable, unusual, and often way more comfortable than a hotel stay. Mega websites like Airbnb , VRBO , and Flipkey make it easier than ever to find and rent your dream spot. Once you commit to going with a rental, be careful not to follow up that good decision with bad ones. From the booking process to the return home, here are 30 things not to do when you vacation in a rental. \nDon’t bother to read the entire listing before you book \nPay attention to the entire listing — and take notes! (Photo: Studio Firma/Stocksy) \nEvery word of the listing is important when you are renting a vacation rental. There simply is no other way to determine if it is what and where you need it to be. Check and double-check the details. \nExpect something that is not mentioned \nSo you wanted hot water? Did the listing say hot water? And don’t think that rentals without hot water are only an issue in foreign countries. There are plenty of backyard rentals across the U.S. without any running water, much less heated water. Don’t expect towels, sheets, Wi-Fi, dishes, air conditioning, heating, or even an oven, unless it is listed. \nRelated: Go Cheap! A State-by-State Guide to Rentals Less Than a $100 \nSkip the reviews \nOther people’s thoughts about a rental can provide vital clues to things you might have skimmed over in the listing. And venture beyond the booking site. Popular rentals have reviews on third-party sites like Trip Advisor , as well. \nForget to factor in taxes and cleaning fees \nStaying in a private rental is not a way to get around paying hotel taxes. It may be in the fine print, but in most cases, the daily rate does not cover the tax. Cleaning fees and damage deposits are common in the rental business. Some of these are refundable, but not all. Read the listing carefully for the details. \nBook through an unknown rental site \nStick to the big names or talk to a realtor for advice. (Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) \nIt’s safest using the big three mentioned above, but don’t shy away from area real estate offices. They are easy to find and offer reputable services, including local assistance in the event that something goes wrong. \nAssume that you will be dealing directly with the owner \nThousands of rental listings come through agents, even on the major rental websites. VRBO stands for Vacation Rentals by Owner, but it also accepts listings from agents. Renting an agent-listed property is no big deal; just know that you may be paying a higher price than similar owner-listed properties because the agent charges the owner a commission for the booking. And if you were expecting that warm fuzzy connection with your host, you won’t likely get that dealing with an agent. \nRelated: What Happens When You Get Bedbugs From an Airbnb Rental? It Isn’t Pretty \nExpect the owner to be in the same city as your rental \nOften vacation rental owners are renting out their second homes. They may not even be in the same country as the rental. \nExpect parking \nThere is nothing worse than renting a car to get around your destination, only to realize that that adorable downtown cottage you rented faces an alley with no parking. Refer back to the top of this list. Read. Every. Word. Twice. \nArrive early \nIt does not matter if your rental is self-managed and cleaned by the owners or by an agent that hires a cleaning crew. Arriving early does two things: upsets someone’s routine and ensures that you will get a rush job on the cleaning of your unit. \nThink it will be spotless \nIf you’re a germaphobe, you might want to bring some wipes. (Photo: Getty Images) \nIt most likely will not be spotless. Rentals usually fall far short of even hotel standards. If germs are an issue for you, bring or buy sanitizing wipes. \nExpect love at first sight \nThere will most likely be things you were not expecting. If you are only staying a night or two, get over it. Did you really come for the accommodations? If your stay is lengthy, give it a day to grow on you before you contemplate making a change. I once stayed in a gorgeous four-bedroom hilltop villa. The drive up and down the winding hillside road was a huge time-suck that I wasn’t happy about at first, but three days of returning home at night to that villa and its gardens made up for the road. \nRelated: The 30 Worst Decisions You Can Make in a Hotel \nThink it’s a hotel \nThere may or may not be shampoo, soap, or matching towels. The décor may be funky. The building may be old, the bathroom tiny, the curtains not black-out. Get those things out of your head and you will be fine. \nExpect complete privacy \nEven when you have read every word of a listing (twice), there may be tiny details that are undisclosed. These often relate to your privacy on the grounds of your rental. The photos may show your rental from every angle except the angle that shows where it attaches to another dwelling. Or there is someone else’s window two feet from your kitchen window. If privacy is what you seek, then ask the host before you commit. \nIgnore host advice \nHosts (even the absentee kind) are a wealth of information. They can tell you where to eat, where to shop, and whether or not you should feed the cat begging at your back door. Read every written word they provide and ask plenty of questions before you go. \nEat things left in the fridge \nTrust us, you’re better off skipping whatever random items have been left in there. (Photo: Ann Thomas/Corbis) \nPeople tend to leave things behind in rental fridges. Some hosts leave it all in there as community property. Just how desperate do you have to be to use someone else’s three-year-old strawberry jam? The exceptions are host-provided treats left just for you and kitchens that are come fully stocked with fresh food. \nLeave things in the fridge \nThere is no sense in perpetuating a problem if other people have left opened stuff behind. And if it was empty when you arrived, then leaving your half-eaten food is extra work for the cleaning crew. Leave behind only things that are in date and unopened. \nTake your pet without asking \nYou might think your dog is awesome, but the owners might not want one in their home. (Photo: Mattia Pelizzari/Stocksy) \nNever assume that your pet is welcome. The hosts may be animal lovers, but simply hate the extra work involved in cleaning up after other people’s animals. They may also have pets of their own who live on the grounds that deserve not to have their territory constantly invaded by guest pets. Always ask. \nRelated: The 30 Worst Decisions You Can Make on a Cruise Ship \nExceed capacity \nIf the listing says the rental sleeps two, that does not mean two plus your brother-in-law, or even your 2-year-old, unless you cleared it with the hosts first. It does not matter that your brother-in-law doesn’t mind sleeping on the floor. Your hosts have their reasons for setting capacity, some of which may involve local ordinances or things like their ability to handle extra trash. \nThrow a party \nThis isn’t your personal party palace. (Photo: Howl/Stocksy) \nThere are cities across the country looking into strengthening ordinances that cover vacation rentals. One of the primary concerns is disruption in neighborhoods caused by parties. You are renting an accommodation for a predetermined number of people, not a frat house. \nForget to forward the details, especially the rules and policies, to your travel companions \nEveryone joining you on your trip needs full disclosure. Really. You want to lose your cleaning deposit because Aunt Jane brought along her Yorkie? \nBe rude to the neighbors \nYou really don’t want to piss this guy off. (Photo: Jamie Kripke/Corbis) \nYou are there by the grace of the neighbors. In some cities, all it takes is one phone call to local law enforcement about your attitude, loud music, or your three extra vehicles and you are out. Remember that deposit you put up? Say “bye bye” to that if the neighbors complain. \nExpect hosts to cater to you \nThere are some rentals where the hosts behave like your newfound family. They may pick you up from the airport, fix your breakfast, or let you use their bicycles. Those are the exceptions. Most rentals are simply business transactions. They have a place for you to sleep; you pay them for it. \nRelated: The Worst Decisions Travelers Make on Vacation \nHog the utilities \nNo matter what outrageous success stories you have read online, renting space to strangers is not the way to get rich. It helps hosts pay the bills, but only when the bills are reasonable. Go easy on the electricity and be mindful of water usage. I once stayed in a rental that had wired the bedroom air conditioner to shut off if the bedroom door was left open. Rental owners take utility bills seriously. \nLock yourself out without any clue how to contact the host \n“SOS. Locked out. Send help!” (Photo: Eva Plevier/Stocksy) \nRemember when we told you that the owner might not be in the same city, or even the same country? This is when it matters. Absentee owners usually have a contingency plan for these things, but first you must be able to call them. \nLet your children behave the way they do at home \nEnforce travel behavior that includes noise levels suitable for the surroundings, being respectful of other people’s space and property, and staying within your eyesight. \nGet too comfortable \nIt is so easy to settle into a rental as if it is your second home. That’s the whole idea. Just don’t forget travel security. When you get too comfortable it becomes easy to forget about locking doors when you go for your stroll on the beach. That could cost you your laptop, your cell phones, or your credit cards. \nDon’t patronize neighborhood businesses \nGet to know the area and support local business by visiting the grocers, shops, and cafes in the area. (Photo: Deirdre Malfatto/Stocksy) \nGrocers, cafes, and whatnot shops near your rental are what keep the neighborhood alive and growing. Half the beauty of staying in a rental is living like a local. Help your temporary neighborhood thrive by exploring and enjoying the businesses close by. \nOverstay your welcome \nLate check out means a disruption in the cleaning schedule at best and at worst a lost night of revenue. Don’t expect it unless you made arrangements well in advance. \nRelated: The 30 Worst Decisions You Can Make in a Casino \nLeave it worse than you found it \nDon’t forget that you are visiting someone’s home. Even if you never laid eyes on the owners, everything in the rental has meaning for them. Protect their things from harm, clean up after yourself, and consider thanking them in writing for sharing their piece of paradise with you. \nForget to leave a review \nGood, bad, or somewhere in between, your experience may help someone making the decision to cross over to the vacation rental way of traveling. \nWATCH: 5 Steps to the Perfect Puerto Rican Getaway \nLet Yahoo Travel inspire you every day.
