UNISTER Travel operates a number of high-profile online travel portals in Germany, with brands such as Ab-In-Den-Urlaub.de, Ab-In-Den-Urlaub-Deals.de, Fluege.de and Reisen.de which together attract over 10 million unique users per month. \nUnder the new agreement, UNISTER Travel’s customers will now be able to access Travelport’s unrivalled travel content from, for example, the world’s leading national and low cost carriers. UNISTER Travel will take advantage of Travelport’s ground-breaking Universal API, giving them the flexibility to design customised user interfaces for their travel portals. It will also make use of Travelport’s Rapid Reprice product for more efficient ticket re-issuing and its Search Control Console product to tailor the relevancy of search results to traveler needs. The news is another positive step forward for Travelport as it continues to grow its reputation and presence in the German travel industry, Europe’s largest, and comes on the back of other high-profile deals concluded earlier this year including the acquisition of German tour operator distribution company, travel-IT. Simon Ferguson, Travelport’s Managing Director for the UK, Ireland and the Nordics commented: “Thanks to targeted investments Travelport has made in its Travel Commerce Platform in recent years, bringing new and innovative products and technology to the industry, as well as even more relevant content, we can offer UNISTER Travel, its online travel portals and its customers genuine added value and meet some of their previously unmet needs. We believe this will make an important contribution to UNISTER Travel’s business success and their growth strategy over the coming years.” Boris Raoul, CEO of UNISTER Travel commented: “UNISTER Travel is already one of the leading suppliers of flight tickets in the German travel industry. The integration of Travelport’s innovative technology into our portals will help us to further optimise the unique selection and variety of flight offerings for our customers.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T13:58:38.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
