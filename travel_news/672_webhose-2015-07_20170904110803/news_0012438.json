According to a 2015 report from the Entertainment Software Association , 42 percent of Americans play video games regularly, and four out of five households own a device used to play games.\nTo put it in the context of other technological trends, more Americans play video games than use Twitter (16 percent) or Netflix-style streaming services (about 40 percent).\nVideo games have made it into the Smithsonian and infiltrated every other form of popular media. As a fully mature, increasingly diverse segment of popular culture, they deserve to be held to the same standards as network TV or page-turning novels.\nAdvertisement Still, the gaming divide has looked especially deep over the past six weeks as two of the biggest games of the year — and, arguably, the 21st century — were released to multimillion-dollar sales and criticisms of their integrity and originality.\nAnd non-gamers have barely noticed.\nGranted, neither of these titles has courted the same kind of culture-war outrage as violent, misogynistic lightning rods like Grand Theft Auto V. The fantasy-based Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, released May 19, and the superhero franchise Batman: Arkham Knight, released June 23, are intricate, open-world role-playing games meant to hook players for dozens of hours. These AAA titles, as the industry calls them (not an acronym, just a fancy-sounding moniker), are also sales juggernauts that follow gaming's overall trend of outpacing movies, music and the publishing industry.\nAn image from the open-world role-playing game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, one of the biggest and fastest-selling games of recent years, released on May 19. (Provided by CD Projekt RED) The Witcher 3, for example, sold 4 million units in its first two weeks alone. At $60 a pop, that's $240 million in revenue for Polish developer CD Projekt Red. Arkham Knight sales have not been made public as of press time, but the trend looks similar: Its first-week sales were reportedly higher than The Witcher 3, and the game has already become the fastest-selling title of the year in the U.K.\nIf you don't play video games, they may seem easy to ignore. But it's harder than it was a few years ago, when primetime TV ads for games, comic-con culture and the loving embrace of all things geeky and digital were far less prevalent.\nThe problem is that actively eschewing games and gaming culture excludes an increasingly vital, influential part of a popular arts ecosystem. The same promises and problems inherent in film, TV and other popular media are writ especially large in gaming. It's a sphere in which the latest technology — like the Oculus Rift virtual-reality headset, which is slated to begin selling early next year — is effectively driving the evolution of how we interact with the world on a daily basis.\nIssues in gaming overlap and reverberate within every other facet of culture. Sick of superhero movies and remakes? So are many gamers, who bemoan the lack of innovation in milked-to-death IPs (or intellectual properties — the gaming term for a potential franchise).\nThe twin pillars of 2015 gaming, The Witcher 3 and Arkham Knight, repeat familiar mechanics, characters and settings from previous games. They're overall engrossing experiences, but they're pushing our buttons instead of challenging us with new ideas, as critically acclaimed games like The Last of Us or Journey have. The fanboy-laden gaming press vacillates between drooling at game creators' achievements and barking at their shortfalls.\nSo why should non-gamers care?\nHolding game creators to a higher standard benefits us all. Trends in gaming often spill over into other media, and gaming itself is becoming inextricable from the buffet of on-demand, multifaceted news and entertainment on our tablets, smartphones, TVs and laptops — all places where games are played.\nEven the seemingly niche areas of gaming, like the streaming channel Twitch (which actually boasts 21 million unique users) or the world of professional gaming, are full of people participating in and influencing every other segment of pop culture.\nIf you've never played a video game, there may seem like no reason to start now. And truly, the gaming world has a history and culture all its own, which can seem either intimidating or foolish to non-gamers.\nBut there are rewards to be had. The best video games aren't just pretty to look at, they're gratifying emotional experiences on par with the most compelling fiction or drama. Poignant stories, customizable characters and interactive, endlessly surprising worlds are becoming more common across platforms and genres. And most games go out of their way to invite new players.\nNonetheless, video games still feel disconnected from larger discussions about how and why we entertain ourselves. Even with their arrival as a powerful economic and cultural force, there's a generational divide.\nAs social media-fueled debates about race and sexual orientation spill over into entertainment — and how responsibly that world reflects its audiences — video games can and should be part of that discussion. What's happening in the digital canyons of Gotham City or The Witcher 3's distant isles of Skellige bear far more on the real world than we'd like to admit.\nBridging the gaming divide increasingly seems less an issue of taste and leisure time, and more of a holistic concern for anyone who considers themselves active participants in pop culture. We deserve better, more inclusive games. But we also deserve to understand how a multibillion dollar global industry is shaping everything around it.\nJohn Wenzel: 303-954-1642, jwenzel@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnwenzel", "external_links": ["http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/0702/20150702__AE05VIDEOGAMES_5~p1.jpg", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2015/01/19/the-top-ten-best-selling-video-games-of-2014/", "http://blog.twitch.tv/2015/06/e3-2015-on-twitch-by-the-numbers/", "http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/", "http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/social-networking-fact-sheet/", "http://www.gamespot.com/articles/batman-arkham-knights-first-week-sales-higher-than/1100-6428482/", "http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/reports/2015/the-total-audience-report-q4-2014.html", "http://www.theesa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ESA-Essential-Facts-2015.pdf"], "published": "2015-07-02T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T01:02:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
