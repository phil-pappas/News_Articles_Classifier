Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Jul 19, 2015 Adv: \nWhen Kenya Airways’ new website went \"live\" again, a great many \"wows\" emerged from users, as the Pride of Africa turned the site’s focus sharply towards their customers. \nThe recently-launched scheme called \"Hot Deals\" shows users of the website, once they have identified their country of origin within the Kenya Airways’ network, the best deals available. \nNavigation of the new site, through highlighted links to key functions like online bookings, online check-in, booking changes, or Kenya Airway’s frequent flyer program, \"Flying Blue,\" has just become easier, and other services are easily found by moving the cursor over the topics on the top of the site. \nSmartphone, Phablet, and Tablet users also have the option to download the Kenya Airways Mobile App and access all these services on their hand-held devices. \nTwo more Boeing B787-8 Dreamliners will be joining the fleet over the next couple of weeks as will another brand new Boeing B737-800NG SkyInterior, which features a state-of-the-art lighting experience throughout the cabin and the new business class seats which Kenya Airways has introduced in the more recently acquired 800NGs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T21:46:49.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
