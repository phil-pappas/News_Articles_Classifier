I am happy about it. I am confident we will get not only special status, but also full cooperation from the Central government for rebuilding the new state.\"\nHe also decried the Opposition's\"attempts to mislead the people in the state.\"\"All this is to divert the attention of the people,\" Naidu said without taking any names.\nThe Chief Minister, who also participated in a seminar on 'Andhra history, culture and traditions' on Friday, urged people to take inspiration from great rulers of the past like Satavahanas, Pallavas, Kakatiyas, Reddi kings and Vizianagaram monarchs who built the state at various stages.\n\"Now Telugus have got two separate states. The bifurcation process was very humiliating. But we should draw inspiration from great leaders like Alluri Seetharama Raju who was a thorn in the flesh of the British, Potti Sriramulu who sacrificed his life for separate Andhra state and NT Rama Rao, who through Telugu Desam Party spread the greatness of Telugus far and wide,\" he stated.\nHe also reminded people to organise 'Pushkara Deeparathana' at their homes this evening to bid farewell to Godavari Mahapushkaram, which ends on Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T04:19:39.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
