Supplied \nPaul Lupi, known as PJ, is in a coma in Bangkok after having a scooter accident in Phuket. Lupi did not have travel insurance. His family are trying to raise $150,000 to keep him in the best care. \n\"PJ remains unconscious but is showing an increased level of arm and leg movement. Shining a torch into his eyes is revealing a quick focus response which is a big improvement from yesterday. \n\"They've put some pumpkin soup in him which is another good sign.\" \nThe 28-year-old was in Phuket on Monday when he crashed on a scooter, the day before he was scheduled to fly home. LUPI FAMILY/ SUPPLIED \nPaul Lupi, on stretcher, is loaded into a plane. \nCaught without travel insurance, Lupi's family rallied to raise money to get him the best possible hospital care. \nFather Paul Lupi Sr, brother Mark Lupi, and friend Matt Hodgson found him in a cramped hospital room in Phuket when they flew to his bedside on Monday. \nHis family immediately put up $50,000 of their own money to have Lupi airlifted to Bangkok's Bumrungrad International Hospital to get specialist treatment. \nLupi's injuries include head trauma but the initial bleeding on the brain has stopped. His right kidney was ruptured and bleeding and his right eye socket is partially broken. Ad Feedback \nJoe Lupi said his brother's body was battered and bruised. \n\"Bruised tissue to various parts of the body is reaching its dramatic stage with some unusual colours competing with each other..\" \nThe Lupi family said they were \"staggered\" at the huge financial response to PJ's accident. \n\"It is so heartening to be able to plan the best options for his recovery knowing the funding will be there to provide it,\" Joe said. \nA fundraising page, which was set up by Lupi's friends and family on Wednesday to cover his care, reached its $150,000 goal on Friday night with more than 1500 people donating money. \n\"Our family is overwhelmed at reaching the goal but also at how many people donated to the cause,\" Joe said. \nIt costs $6000 a day to keep Paul in the hospital in Bangkok, plus scans and surgery and the cost to bring him home, his family said. \nThey were also working with about $150,000 of other funds they had raised outside of the fundraiser, through banks and other sources. \nMark Lupi posted on the givealittle page from Bangkok on Friday. \n\"Thanks everybody for your love and donations. You're literally saving PJ's life.\" \nTravel insurance for two weeks in Asia for a New Zealander in his or her 20s is widely available for between $80 and $125. \nJoe Lupi urged other families on Wednesday to check their travel insurance details. \n\"Parents, family and friends please, please check your loved ones' insurance covers you for travelling offshore, it's a detail that's so easy to overlook.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T11:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T12:42:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
