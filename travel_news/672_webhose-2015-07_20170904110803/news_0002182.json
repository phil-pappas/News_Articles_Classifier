This monsoon stand transfixed, drink greedily, in the beauty that lay at your feet is a verdant valley with thick pine trees and paddy fields cling to its hillsides, near to china border and a silvery river snaking through its heart, the waters dance merrily over mass covered boulders. In a meeting of Archeological Survey of India (ASI) on December 12, 2012 it was nominated for inscription in the World Heritage Site. The town is called as Hapoli or locally known by the Apatanis as “Hao-Polyang” and villagers are known by Apatani tribals. People follow the Tibetan culture. Let’s Explore Armed with my camera I started my journey from Ziro Putu also known as Army Putu. The place itself treated my eyes with refresh greenery. For a change get an off from Honk and high decibel of metro city to witness a unique Bamboo Groove expertise of farm forestry. Here a one stem bamboo (monopodial) is grown with blue clad pine. Hikers and picnickers make it a point to visit this groove.
