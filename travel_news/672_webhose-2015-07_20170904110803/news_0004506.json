But a Myanmar river cruise is becoming as popular as a trip up the Nile or the Danube. Soon everyone will want to experience this easily arranged adventure. Who would have thought?\nA cruise is a great way to see Myanmar, particularly parts beyond the main centres that are only accessible by river or for those people who aren’t brave enough to venture out on their own. The passengers are older too – retirees and the over 50s crowd – not the backpackers and intrepid budget travellers who were, until recently, the main visitors venturing into the once-forbidden Golden Land of Buddhism.\nI cruised the Irrawaddy last year on Pandaw’s RV Katha when it was still the only tourist rivercraft regularly plying the river, apart from E&O’s Road to Mandalay . But in late 2104, new cruise lines started moving into the area, including those that had mainly traversed European waterways. The sun sets over the Irrawaddy.

Scenic has also just announced plans to enter this newly competitive market in 2016 with a ship that is still under construction.\nThe most original and authentic, Pandaw vessels are true expedition ships. The fleet of nine brass and teak steamers are replicas of the old colonial steamers that used to ply the Irrawaddy as supply vessels, part of the former Irrawaddy Flotilla Company. Owner Paul Strachan, an art historian and author of numerous books on the history and art of Burma, started Pandaw as a joint venture with the Burmese government in 1995. He says the Pandaw difference is that “we have kept the same colonial style and standards as when I first started 20 years ago”.\nExpedition cruises are a great way to go beyond Pagan, Mandalay and Yangon and to see the more remote regions of Burma: ancient river villages and historic sites only accessible by river.\nPandaw also has the longest, most far-reaching journeys, up to 20 days exploring the Upper Chindwin as far as Homalin and the Upper Irrawaddy as far as Katha.\nPandaw may have forged the path but straight-A luxury European-style is coming to the Asian river. Most of the newer ships have individual balconies, floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall panoramic windows and fancier facilities than Pandaw. The itineraries are shorter – four to 11 days – and the cruises are seasonal, usually running from September through April when annual floodwaters make the river rise to a high enough level.\nMost are all-inclusive. Prices range from less than $1000 for a three-night cruise to more than $5000 a person for an 11-night cruise.\nApart from Cruiseco which, like Pandaw, ventures into the Upper Chindwin to remote parts of the river, the newer operators offer short sailing itineraries from three to 12 nights between main cities such as Mandalay Pagan and Prome.\n Blue skies over the Irrawaddy River.

It has floor-to-ceiling windows, French decor and individual french balconies on the lower deck and full balconies on the upper deck.\nChoose from 11, 14 or 17-night itineraries. Prices from $4499 a person.\nSee cruising.com.au or ph 1800 225 656.\nA&K’s Sanctuary Retreats\nThe newest addition to the Sanctuary Retreats’ portfolio of luxury safari lodges and expedition cruises, the Ananda first set sail on the Irrawaddy in November. Sanctuary Retreats is part of Abercrombie & Kent, which has extended its philosophy of luxury, from Africa and Egypt into Myanmar.\nSee sanctuaryretreats.com or ph (03) 9536 1831.\nAPT\nAPT began offering its own sailings in February aboard its new AmaPura river ship, a 56-passenger vessel furnished with a mix of modern and traditional motifs. All 28 suites feature a French balcony, a step-out full balcony or twin balconies. APT will launch a second boutique rivership, the RV Samatha next year with 30 suites (the largest is 48.7sq m) and cuisine by celebrity chef Luke Nguyen.\nSee aptouring.com.au or ph 1300 336 932.\nAvalon Waterways\nBased on Avalon’s Suite Ship concept pioneered on the rivers of Europe, but in a smaller format for Asian cruising, Avalon will launch a new ship on the Irrawaddy in September this year. Avalon Myanmar will have 18 air-conditioned 23sq m suites in a contemporary Asian style with Avalon’s signature open-air balcony and panoramic windows. Ten-night cruises (as part of a 14-day Yangon-Yangon itinerary) cruising from the temple-dotted plains of Bagan to the upper reaches of the Irrawaddy at Bhamo with several departures each month.\nSee avalonwaterways.com.au or ph 1300 230 234.\nScenic\nThe newest addition to the Scenic fleet, Scenic Aura launches in September next year. Cruising the river between Mandalay and Pyay, it will feature 22 all-balcony suites, pool, choice of dining options and butler service, and is set to be the most luxurious custom-built ship on the Irrawaddy. Scenic claims The Aura will also be the most modern of the ships on the river, with three instead of the usual two decks, an open-air cinema, fitness centre, cafe and bar, and floor-to-ceiling windows. Scenic is throwing in free flights to Asia for all cruises booked before August 2015.\nSee scenictours.com.au or ph 13 81 28.\nInsider Journeys\nFormerly known as Indochina Travel, Insider Journeys is another recent entrant, chartering Hallmark’s Irrawaddy Explorer for Treasures of Golden Burma, a 12-night adventure on the river. Departures from Mandalay to Yangon cost from $5589 a person or shorter cruises from about $1000. Insider currently also has a fly-free offer coupled with a cabin upgrade on this cruise.\nSee insiderjourneys.com.au or ph 1300 138 755.", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/743503-d6773fcc-26bb-11e5-b33b-dc629bef0d9a.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/743529-d9bca208-26bb-11e5-b33b-dc629bef0d9a.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-20T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T20:17:02.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
