What's southwest of Hawaii and twice the size of Texas? The largest marine reserve in the world.\nCreated by the Obama administration in September 2014, this staggeringly large marine park protects disparate patches of the Pacific Ocean that surround U.S.-controlled islands and atolls.\nThe newly protected area is said to hold a large number of undersea mountains (or seamounts) with thriving colonies of deepwater corals and vital habitat for tunas, turtles, manta rays, sharks, cetaceans and seabirds.\nMining, dumping and commercial fishing are all prohibited within the reserve, but recreational fishing and tourism are both allowed with a permit.\nPitcairn Islands Marine Reserve (British Overseas Territories)\nThe Pacific Remote Islands may house the largest collection of marine reserves in the world, but British officials outdid their American counterparts this March by creating the biggest continuous marine park around the (relatively) nearby Pitcairn Islands, a British Overseas Territory that encompasses Henderson, Oeno, Ducie and Pitcarin islands.\nThe so-called Pacific Zone covers 834,000 square meters, or more than twice the land area of the British Isles.\nThe goal of the marine reserve is to protect the wealth of the ocean from illegal fishing activities and safeguard endemic species like butterfly fish and squirrelfish, among others.\nMost tourists visit the volcanic Pitcairn Island and its 56 residents aboard a cruise ship or the supply boat MV Claymore II, which has frequent sailings to and from Mangareva in French Polynesia (where you'll find the closest airport).\nMORE: Protecting Pitcairn's marine bounty\nEl Impenetrable National Park (Argentina)\nBehold the power of crowd funding, where a murdered rancher's untouched estancia becomes a cause celebre and, 10.5 million pesos ($1.2 million) later, a new national park.\nEl Impenetrable Forest is a biologically rich swath of swampy jungle in northern Argentina that has survived the agricultural clear-cutting responsible for destroying forests all around it.\nA wildly successful fundraising campaign prompted Argentina's Congress to officially declare 300,000 acres as El Impenetrable National Park in October 2014, providing protection for endangered species like jaguars, giant armadillos and crowned solitary eagles.\nYet, it's a bittersweet victory for conservation.\nArgentina's National Parks Administration has yet to exert its control over the land, and scientists warn that if the inaction continues, poachers will move in and irreparably destroy this virgin forest.\nParque Nacional El Impenetrable , Argentina;\nHunsruck-Hochwald National Park (Germany)\nHunsr√ºck-Hochwald: Europe's newest national park. Europe's newest national park opened this March in Germany just 90 minutes southwest of Frankfurt Airport or 60 minutes east of Luxembourg Airport.\nNestled between the vineyards of the Mosel to the north and the rambling Rhine to the east, this 10,000-hectare reserve protects ancient beech trees, thriving moorland and rolling arnica and nardus grasslands.\nIt's also an important habitat for black storks and home to one of the largest wild forest cat populations in Europe.\nVisitors can enjoy the scenery on a well-marked network of hiking routes that includes the Saar-Hunsruck Climb, which German Hiking Institute ranked as the nation's best long-distance trail.\nLusaka National Park (Zambia)\nMost African parks lie in remote areas far from a major city, but the newly inaugurated Lusaka National Park sits just 30 kilometers southeast of the Zambian capital.\nThis 4,976-hectare reserve, which had a grand opening in May, offers a chance for those passing through Lusaka to easily get out into nature while enjoying ample facilities such as game-viewing platforms and an expansive tourist center.\nThe park is an important water catchment area for the Chalimbana river system and is now home to 22 different species of wild animals, including impala, nyala, kudu, zebra, giraffe and white rhino.\nZambia Wildlife Authority hopes to use the new reserve to breed animal stocks and repopulate under-stocked protected areas elsewhere in the country.\nKimberley National Park (Australia)\nA two-million-hectare slice of Western Australia's Kimberley region will soon become a national park after two major mining companies relinquished their tenements in March.\nThe new reserve will absorb the existing Prince Regent, Mitchell River and Lawley River national parks to become the biggest national park in Australia.\nThe once off-limits Mitchell Plateau is expected to be the jewel in the crown of Kimberley National Park, with significant biological diversity and spectacular gorges dotted with waterfalls.\nParks Australia will also protect the park's coastal boundaries as a marine reserve, bringing the total protected area to nearly five million hectares.\nPatagonia Park (Chile)\nMore than a decade in the making, Patagonia Park recently opened to the public as a \"private park in progress\" in the Aysen region of southern Chile .\nThis 660,000-acre reserve sits atop what was once overgrazed ranchland in the ecologically precious Chacabuco Valley, but is now on its way to becoming one of the largest new national parks of the 21st century, boasting reinvigorated populations of pumas, condors and endangered huemul deer.\nConservationists have heralded Patagonia Park as \"the Yellowstone of South America\" thanks to the meticulous work of Conservacion Patagonica to balance conservation, restoration and ecotourism.\nThis Austral summer was the first time the main lodge and restaurant were fully operational in anticipation of an official grand opening in early 2016, by which time Conservacion Patagonica expects the visitor center, a second campground and an array of additional trails to be ready and waiting for tourists from around the world.", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150717173006-nature-reserves--pacific-remote-islands-full-169.jpg",
