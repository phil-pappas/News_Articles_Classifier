If you look at the travel volume between Myanmar and Thailand, it is already huge and I’m sure this agreement would further increase the traffic between the two countries,” said Ko Sai Kyaw Thet, general manager of Yangarbo Travel and Tours based in Yangon. \n\nCurrently, Thai visas cost US$40 lasting 14 days for a single entry within six months. \n\nMyanmar has already signed visa exemption agreements with Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines, as well as pending agreements with Singapore and Malaysia. \n\nThailand and Myanmar were previously expected to sign a visa exemption agreement during Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra’s visit to Yangon in November 2013, but the Thai PM cancelled the visit because of political issues back home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T11:41:54.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
