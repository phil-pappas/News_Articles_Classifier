There is thought to be nearly 1 million of them in the country and they are called hikikomori.\nThe name relates to the condition from which the members of this group appear to suffer.\nThe trend of young Japanese, predominantly males, locking themselves away is causing very worrying social and health problems for the country and is mystifying mental health experts.\nYuto Onishi, now 18, spent nearly three years as a shut-in as he excommunicated himself from friends and family. Living in his bedroom, he would sleep during the day, surf online and read comics at night — occasionally slinking out to get some food.\n“Once you experience it, you lose reality,” Mr Onishi told the ABC’s 7.30 this week.\n“I knew it was abnormal but I didn’t want to change ... It felt safe,” he said.\nMr Onishi became a hikikomori after he failed as a team leader at school and felt like an embarrassment, a feeling exacerbated by pressure placed on him by his family.\nHis reasoning for permanently retreating to his bedroom is common among hikikomori. The intense pressure to perform at school or achieve in society leads some to deal with rejection or humiliation by shutting themselves away.\nSome stay in their rooms for years on end.

The Japanese government has poured huge amounts of funding into greater understanding hikikomori, however the rate of successful treatments remains low.\nOver four years ago, a support centre opened up in the city of Fukuoka, nearly 900km southwest of Tokyo.\nIn the local dialect, the name of the centre translates to “It’s OK, don’t worry about it” and the small centre mainly fields phone calls from those who’ve become reclusive, as well as many worried parents.\nTakahiro Kato, a professor in the neuropsychiatry department at Kyushu University has worked with the centre in an effort to study hikikomori.\nIn addition to a strong emotional dependence on their parents, he believes the increasingly digital nature of life is contributing to the problem.\n“In Western societies, if one stays indoors, they’re told to go outside,” Dr Kato told the ABC. “In Japan they’re not.”\nMany hikikomori still live with their parents who financially enable the lifestyle and in some reported cases bring food to their door.\nDr Kato works with groups of hikikomori and tries to counsel them in order to get them to re-enter society.\n“We’re working on the social and biological aspects as well (as psychological) and want to be the first to provide a multidimensional diagnosis,” he said.\nMany rely on their parents for financial support to live as hikikomori.

So much so that French psychologist Nicolas Tajan remarked to The Japan Times last year: “If you ask people in Japan about hikikomori, almost everyone will say, ‘I know somebody like that’ but there is no such word in France.”\nHowever other cases of the condition have been studied in countries including the US, Spain and Hong Kong.\nInterest and curiosity in the phenomenon has also piqued over recent years in the international community and led to a number of books and films outside of Japan, documenting hikikomori.\nThose trying to tackle the issue hope the greater awareness will somehow help in the process of getting many young Japanese teens and adults to emerge from the safety of their bedrooms.\nHIKIKOMORI, A DEAFENING SILENCE - Teaser from MACHINEMACHINE on Vimeo .\nOriginally published as Why Japan’s youth are disappearing", "external_links": ["http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227437/631930-e21ecb46-2518-11e5-a1dc-713890f6a5ce.jpg", "https://vimeo.com/user2651694", "https://vimeo.com/107268105", "http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2014/09/13/books/book-reviews/world-fear-japans-shut-ins/#.VZybw_mqpBd", "https://player.vimeo.com/video/107268105", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-fight-to-save-japans-young-shut-ins-1422292138", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/around-1nbspmillion-japanese-lock-themselves-in-bedrooms-and-will-not-come-out/story-fnq2oad4-1227437633185", "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-07/hikikomori-japanese-men-locking-themselves-in-their-bedrooms/6601656", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227437/633105-7433dd42-2518-11e5-a1dc-713890f6a5ce.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227437/633157-fcd5f764-2510-11e5-a1dc-713890f6a5ce.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T22:16:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
