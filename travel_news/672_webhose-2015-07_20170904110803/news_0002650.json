However, the flights will only be from several European cities to Ovda Airport north of Eilat and will focus on bringing tourists during the winter.\n The Irish airline, which has almost 40% of the market share of low-cost seats in Europe, announced Tuesday that it is starting to carry out \"experimental\" flights to Israel, as was first reported by Ynet .\n New Flights From Tel Aviv to Amsterdam for €48 / Ynetnews EasyJet introduces new route in addition to nine existing routes it already operates out of Israel. Click here for more\nAccording to David O'Brien, commercial director of the company, it decided to run test flights this winter from a number of European destinations, including Budapest and Krakow, to Ovda Airport.\nIn total, there will be six flights a week. \"We intend to bring tourists from these destinations looking for a winter sun holiday,\" O'Brien told Ynet.\nRyanair will start flying to Ovda airport north of Eilat (Photo: Shutterstock)\n\"This is not necessarily directed at tourists interested in going to Eilat, but rather to tourists who will come due to the attractive price. A lot of tourists from these destinations fly to the Canary Islands in wintertime, but Israel is two hours less far each way, and the price is very attractive.\"\n \"It is not profitable for us to fly to Tel Aviv\"\nWhen asked why Ryanair does not fly to Tel Aviv, O'Brien said that under present conditions, it is not profitable for the company to fly there. \"If I can run a plane between Athens and Santorini several times a day, it doesn't pay for me to run flights to Israel only once a day at a higher cost.\"\nCommercial Director of Ryanair David O'brien (Photo: Danny Sadeh)\n\"We are in contact with the Israeli authorities regarding flights from Tel Aviv, but are unable to get what we want. We have no complaints against the authorities, and it's not the Israel Airports Authority, which is growing every year, which means that they are doing just fine. But we are not EasyJet and we do not operate under those conditions.\"\n\"Ben Gurion Airport's mode of operation does not fit the way we operate and our mode of operation doesn't fit that of Ben Gurion Airport. We do not want to participate in the Israeli tourist industry at any price. A plane of ours that flies to Israel can at the same time make more rounds in Europe, and for us that is much more economical.\"\n Tweet", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ynetnews/129653250402500?fref=ts", "http://images1.ynet.co.il/PicServer4/2015/07/07/6154870/518667601001599640360no.jpg", "http://images1.ynet.co.il/PicServer4/2015/07/07/6154732/6154725010015100490552no.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "https://twitter.com/share", "http://twitter.com/#!/ynetnews"], "published": "2015-07-08T07:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T16:31:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
