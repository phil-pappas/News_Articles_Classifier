The chances of viewing a city from such a great height may not come to you again, so do not miss it! \nDubai Creek: The Dubai Creek is a place that represents the city which existed before it became a glamour city that it is today. In short, this is a place where it all began. The Dubai Creek separates Bur Dubai from Deira and it is on the side of Bur Dubai that the Bin Yas tribe first settled. Today, Dubai Creek is a highly developed part of the city although it still carries the old world charm. Here, you can visit the Dubai Museum, Sheikh Saeed Al-Maktoum House, Jumeirah Mosque, Grand Mosque and several such important places. You can also enjoy the beautiful sights of the Dubai Creek while on a dhow cruise with including delicious dinner. \nDubai City Tour: Apart from Burj Khalifa and Dubai Creek, there are many other things that you should see in Dubai. Dubai Marina, Jumeirah Beach, the Palm Island, etc. are some of these places. If you want to view the entire city in a few hours time, going on a city bus tour would be a great idea. These city tour buses take you to the important landmarks of the city and also allow you to get off the bus if you wish to explore something that interests you. This is a great way of sightseeing in Dubai if you are here on a short trip. \nThings to DoDubai is a place where you can experience a flurry of activities.

The desert safari tour comes in various packages which include a regular desert safari trip, overnight desert safari tour and a luxurious desert safari trip. There are also desert resorts that conduct safari tours for their guests. Whichever tour you choose, you would get a taste of the life in a desert. With camel riding, dune bashing, belly dancing and henna painting, you would have a great evening. In addition to this is the dinner with all the lip-smacking Arabic or Lebanese cuisine that would give a ravishing end to your day as well as the trip. \nDhow Cruise Dinner: The dhow is a traditional Bedouin style boat that was used for transportation as well as travelling in the olden days in Dubai. You can still see these dhows on the creeks, lakes and canals of Dubai but not as a vehicle of transportation but mostly in the form of floating restaurants. Dhow cruise dinners are conducted both on the Dubai Creek and the Dubai Marina. These floating restaurants are decorated beautifully with lights and ooze a calm and relaxing environment. The lower deck is fully air-conditioned while the upper deck acts as an open air restaurant. Wherever you choose to sit, you can enjoy beautiful sights and mouth-watering dishes served in the buffet. \nFerrari World: Agreed that the Ferrari World is part of Abu Dhabi but you can surely assign one day or half a day for a trip to this spectacular amusement park. Situated in Yas Island, it would take you just 1.5 hours to reach the Ferrari World from Dubai. This adventure park is a proud owner of several thrilling rides. But the Formula Rossa definitely takes the price. This is the fastest roller coaster ride with a speed of 240 km/hour. Other rides you will find here include Fiorano GT Challenge, Mission Ferrari, Karting Academy, Mission Ferrari, Viaggio in Italia, etc. \nRestaurants in DubaiDubai is unquestionably a haven for foodies.
