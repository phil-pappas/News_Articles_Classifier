Be different. Be surprising Adv: \nJul 28, 2015 Adv: \nBERLIN, Germany - Berlin is one of the hippest cities in the world and, since 1978, part of the brand name of airberlin. \"airberlin is like Berlin: always on the move - an original that does not adapt. We are a young company with a team full of heart. The airberlin brand is emotional, progressive and edgy. That is also the external image we want to portray with the slogan 'Be confident, be different, be surprising'\", said airberlin Chief Executive Officer Stefan Pichler. \nModel Martine Lindskjold got her first tattoo when she was 18. Now she is 26 and works as a tattoo model in addition to her job as a jewelry designer. She symbolizes the Berlin lifestyle in hip, trendy boroughs such as Friedrichshain, Kreuzberg and Neukölln. That is also where you can see Lindskjold as a model for airberlin. Such as on a giant poster on Hermannplatz in the middle of the trendy borough of Neukölln where a multitude of potential airberlin passengers stay. The campaign is still limited to the capital city where the brand wants to establish itself as a cool home carrier among the locals. Berlin residents have every reason to get excited: The new slogan is just the beginning of a series of sensational summer promotions form airberlin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T22:27:20.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
