Developers who are trying to create a year-round destination resort 100 miles north of Manhattan have faced an unusually prolonged environmental review amid opposition.\n\"Obviously, had one stood at the base of a ladder in 1998 and realized how high it was, one would have been hesitant about going up the first rung,\" said Dean Gitter of Crossroads Ventures.\nGitter said Monday that the resort will be an economic engine for the sparsely populated area.\nThe Belleayre project has faced the same sort of push-back many large developments do, but more so because of its high perch in a state forest preserve that provides New York City with drinking water. Opponents have claimed the mega-project straddling two rural towns on Belleayre Mountain would carve up pristine woods, clog winding mountain roads and taint the city's water.\nA 2007 deal brokered by then-Gov. Eliot Spitzer addressed those issues by getting Crossroads to commit to a scaled-back proposal with fewer hotels rooms and a smaller footprint. Developers also agreed to avoid building on the wilderness land that particularly concerned city officials.\nIt worked, partially.\nWhile some environmental groups dropped their opposition, local passions never cooled entirely. Some residents thrilled at the prospect of hundreds of new jobs planted lawn signs reading \"More Jobs â€” Less Taxes.\" Others who feared overdevelopment, environmental degradation and local businesses being hurt by a self-contained resort put up their own signs reading \"Save the Mountain.\"\n\"The cumulative impact is one of turning an area that is an escape for people into the thing that they were trying to escape,\" said Kathy Nolan, chairwoman of Catskill Heritage Alliance.\nNolan said the alliance was disappointed that Martens cancelled the adjudicatory hearing on the proposal that had been ordered by an administrative law judge, which cleared the way for permits. Nolan said the group was considering its legal options.\nGitter said he was pleased but noted that the approval process continues. Significantly, the resort still needs to be reviewed by the planning boards of the two towns it will straddle, Shandaken in Ulster County and Middletown in Delaware County.\n\"My hope is by this time next year we'll be able to stick a shovel in the ground,\" Gitter said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T11:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T23:12:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
