Purchased exactly 2yrs ago, and now I'm looking for a more all terrain jogging stroller. Have kept it very clean and free of damage. I used the travel bag at all times to keep stroller safe and cleaned it after every use (I'm a little OCD). Original price was $729+$100 for travel Bag. 100% Nylon Fullsize Toddler seat faces toward you or away from you and have several recline positions. Bassinet was used once cause my baby hated laying flat, so it's in perfect condition, and kept in bag for safe keeping. Aerated bassinet canopy and mattress pad with vented base all for increased breathability. Easy 1 step fold with or without the seat attached SPF 50 plus drop down sunshade reclines to 180 degrees. Includes bug shield and rain shield. Please text or email me for any inquiries!!!
