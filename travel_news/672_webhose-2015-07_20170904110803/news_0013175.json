It seems within the realm of possibility to visit all of them over the course of a (very long) weekend until you realize the Disney World problem.\nThe complex includes the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney’s Hollywood Studios and Disney’s Animal Kingdom, four equally appealing options. Most people have to choose between Disney World and the rest, but roller coaster enthusiasts like me (and very ambitious family travelers) refuse to make a decision. We can do it all.\nFortunately, Disney World offers a one-day park hopper ticket for the four parks. You may not see it advertised in packages because there’s no discount for it. Also, some may think it crazy to attempt to traverse these four parks in a day. Each has rides that a thrill lover wouldn’t want to miss. But visiting all four in a day is possible with patience, stamina, a solid pair of walking shoes and a few tips.\nHere is some advice on experiencing the thrills at the parks while still having time later for refreshments at Downtown Disney.\nPhoto Big Thunder Mountain Railroad roller coaster at the Magic Kingdom.

During breakfast, we downloaded the Disney World app and linked the tickets to it. That gave us access to the Fast Pass+ system, which allows you to reserve time on rides. We chose a three-ride pass, which you must use at only one park.\nUsing the pass at the Magic Kingdom made sense; it would be the last park we would visit, and reservations had already filled up on the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, the new ride that I wanted to try. Because we would have to wait in line for that one, I booked reservations for Big Thunder Mountain Railroad and Space Mountain. It was time to start.\n11 a.m. I decided to make Disney’s Animal Kingdom our first stop because I was eager to ride Expedition Everest, a signature high-speed roller coaster that weaves around mountain landscapes and comes with some surprises. It’s one of three attractions in the Disney World complex that has a line for single riders; we got in line and shaved 30 minutes off the 45-minute wait for people who were riding with companions.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Single riders have to go with strangers, but it’s worth it. The ride has bold twists and turns, a crazy moment where it goes backward and, in the mountain, offers an encounter with a menacing creature. We had enough time to try it twice.\nAdequately jostled, we went on to Dinosaur, an energetic indoor ride that whisks you from room to room amid aggressive animatronic dinos. There was a 30-minute wait, but the line moved with a steady pace and was mostly indoors.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story The last ride we took was Primeval Whirl, the delightful wild mouse coaster. It zigzags back and forth through hairpin turns, then the cars start to spin as they move along the track. Because the ride is constantly loading and has two tracks, the wait to board was less than 10 minutes. With that, we were done with Animal Kingdom.\n1 p.m. Next up was Disney’s Hollywood Studios, which includes my favorite Disney park ride, the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. We drove there rather than take Disney World transport so we would have the car with us at the end. (You can pay once for parking and use that receipt to park all day at the other parks.) We found a spot, got our tickets scanned and headed in. (The swift admission is one of the advantages of the park hopper ticket.)\nWe took the Tower of Terror ride, essentially a crazy haunted elevator that drops and rises at random intervals, brilliantly done and very popular. The wait was a punishing 45 minutes, though.\nTo make up time, we grabbed a quick lunch on the way to Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster, the indoor ride that features music by Aerosmith. This time, we waited less than 20 minutes to get on because of the single-rider line. This attraction is meant to simulate a crazy limo ride along with Aerosmith, and it begins by launching the train at high speeds into a series of loops and hills.\nWe could have gone on to Star Tours, the energetic simulated 3-D “Star Wars” ride. But given the 30-minute wait, we thought that our time would best be spent elsewhere, like a similar simulated ride at Epcot, Mission: Space.\nPhoto The Test Track ride at Epcot. Credit Kent Phillips/Walt Disney World Resort 3:30 p.m. Epcot is spread out and doesn’t provide a lot of high-intensity options, so we stayed mostly in Future World at the front of the park; venturing into the World Showcase section would have meant lots of strolling and very few thrills.\nPeter really wanted to ride the laid-back, moody Spaceship Earth, inside the globe near the entrance. Lucky for us, the wait was roughly five minutes, so we indulged.\nNext was Test Track, which had the fastest moving single-rider line we experienced in the parks. It seats three across, and attendants are frequently looking for a third person to fill in a seat. This ride comes with a challenge: You have to design a concept vehicle on a computer and then take your vehicle through a few paces to determine performance. The ride concludes with a speed test in the open air around a fixed track. We were on it within 15 minutes.\nNow that we were in geek mode, we could try Mission: Space, which simulates a rocket launch to Mars, with a good amount of sound and movement in a slightly claustrophobic environment. The digital Mars animations are fascinating. The wait, 25 minutes, was not too bad.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story To get a taste of the World Showcase, we visited the country closest to the Future World attractions, the Mexico Pavilion. In the rear of the pavilion, which is inside a giant pyramid, is the Gran Fiesta tour, a leisurely boat ride with Donald Duck animations on screens built into the walls. Perhaps because it’s a bit hidden away, it had no line whatsoever the day we were there. We got enough of a glimpse of what Epcot had to offer and had to move on.\nPhoto The Mission: Space ride at Epcot. Credit Doris Cain/Walt Disney World Resort 5:30 p.m. Our first Fast Pass reservation in the Magic Kingdom was around 6:30 p.m. We left Epcot to get to Magic Kingdom (which involves parking, a monorail ride through a hotel and across water to the park entrance) and have dinner. We used the Fast Pass at Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, a steel roller coaster, before our 9 p.m. reservation on Space Mountain.\nWe checked the app to see the wait time because I felt it essential to ride the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, the newest roller coaster in the park, regardless of the wait, which was listed at 60 minutes; we went for it.\nWhile we waited, we played a touch-screen game where you gather and sort gems into different trays by shape. Another spot in the line allowed you to spin a barrel of glowing gems until they projected an animation on the ceiling.\nNext was the Haunted Mansion (a 15-minute wait) because we still had some time to kill before Space Mountain. It was standard haunted house fare with a bit of technology thrown in: You are seated in a two-person car and guided through a spooky mansion with hologram ghosts.\nWe got to Space Mountain full of anticipation. I remembered this ride as stellar when I was a child, and after all these years, it remains a thrill. As we got off and noticed the line was short even for those without Fast Pass, we decided to wait to ride it a second time. We still exited the ride in time to make a light show at the castle, and were able to leave by 10:30 p.m.\nIn roughly a 12-hour period, we traversed four parks, rode all of Disney World’s coasters and took advantage of many other rides with minimal wait times. We were weary but believed we had done more than most would think possible, and left early enough to rest up for more theme park fun elsewhere the next day.", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/05/travel/05DISNEY3/05DISNEY3-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/05/travel/05DISNEY3/05DISNEY3-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/05/travel/05DISNEY1/05DISNEY1-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/05/travel/05DISNEY1/05DISNEY1-master180.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/05/travel/05DISNEY2/05DISNEY2-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/05/travel/05DISNEY2/05DISNEY2-master180.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-02T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T14:05:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
