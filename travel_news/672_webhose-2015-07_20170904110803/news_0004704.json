To him, the warmth of Sri Lankan hospitality had to be evident in the open spaces; complemented by the interior ambience which was inspired from various periods in the city’s history. Upon entering, visitors remain in awe of a battle unfolding in front of their own eyes, woven in copper and brass, seemingly snatched from ages long past – the battle of Randeniya, between the Dutch and the Sinhalese, sculpted by renowned artist Laki Senanayake. \nThe character of the hotel is evident in every aspect, and even more so through the many culinary experiences at the Cinnamon Room, Nihal’s and the recently lauded Cardamom Café, which becomes the first restaurant in Sri Lanka to be recognized by the most influential source of wine in the world – Wine Spectator ( www.winespectator.com ). This also functions as recognition of Jetwing’s unparalleled commitment in offering a carefully curated and diverse selection of wine selection of wines from all wine producing countries in the world to the discerning guests. The property will thus be featured in the August print issue of Wine Spectator, in their Annual Restaurant Awards Guide. \nLaunched in 1996, Wine Spectator has become the go-to resource for all wine-related subjects. Featuring a database of more than 250,000 wine ratings, tasting reports, news and features, the Restaurant Wine List Awards have become a prestigious listing of their own with very strict requirements. As officially described, basic requirements are that “the list must present complete, accurate wine information. It must include vintages and appellations for all selections, including wines available by the glass. Complete producer names and correct spellings are mandatory, while the overall presentation and appearance of the list is also taken into consideration”. For the Award of Excellence, lists should offer “a well-chosen selection of quality producers, along with a thematic match to the menu in both price and style. Typically, these lists offer at least 90 selections”. \n“Jetwing Lighthouse has always been a benchmark in the hospitality industry of Sri Lanka – when we first opened the hotel, Galle was a one-night destination on round tours of the island. Today, the city is known the world over for quality and the finer things in life. Only a few months ago, we hosted the first ever master class and wine tasting of nine Grand Crus 2005 wines, again at Jetwing Lighthouse. Through the Wine Spectator Award of Excellence for the Cardamom Café and events such as these, we see tourism and travel in the South elevating to new heights, and I thank all our associates for making this a reality” said Hiran Cooray, Chairman of Jetwing. \nFamily owned and in the tourism industry for the past 42 years, Jetwing Hotels has surpassed expectation at every aspect. Building on their foundation of being passionate, as well as the experience of true, traditional Sri Lankan hospitality, constantly pioneering discoveries captures the essence of the brand. Such a strong statement and direction have enabled Jetwing Hotels to imagine, create and manage marvels and masterpieces, where distinctive design and elegant comfort complement each other and the environment. Considered a priority, sustainable and responsible practice is implemented through the award winning Jetwing Eternal Earth Program; with energy efficiency, community upliftment, and education of earth saving measures to schoolchildren being a few tenets of the Program.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T01:24:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
