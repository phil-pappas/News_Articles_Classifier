The company will bring its contemporary dusitD2 brand to the Kingdom’s capital city of Thimphu, as well as to scenic Punakha. \nThe first of these projects, the dusitD2 Thimphu, will launch in 2017. It will be the city’s largest hotel with 83 guest rooms and suites. Featuring modern architecture highlighting local Bhutanese design elements, the boutique hotel will be located in the city centre, just an hour’s drive from Paro International Airport by car. It will offer guests and local residents an international restaurant, spa, gym and a nightclub set to become a new hub of the city’s growing social scene. \nIn 2019, the dusitD2 Punakha will come on board. Located approximately 3 hours by car from Thimphu, the hotel will offer stunning river and mountain views from each of its 53 guest rooms and suites. In addition to an international all-day dining restaurant, the hotel will also offer guests an outdoor pool to complement its spa and wellness facilities. \nThe two properties will be developed and owned by Yarkay Group Private Limited, a company with diversified businesses ranging from construction, real estate development, to now a new venture into the hospitality sector in association with Dusit International. \n“We are extremely excited to add Bhutan to our portfolio,” said Mr Rustom Vickers, Group Director of Development – Dusit International. “With Thailand being a key source market to Bhutan, we are ready to bring the Dusit brand and our trademark of gracious hospitality to one of the region’s most alluring and well preserved countries.” \n“Thai hospitality is very well received in Bhutan,” said Ms Phub Zam, Managing Director, Yarkay Group. “Bhutanese also love to travel to Thailand, and many already know the Dusit brand. The company’s dusitD2 brand is a great fit to the Bhutanese hospitality market, and we are very confident that with Dusit’s dynamic management team, we will create an unparalleled, memorable experience for all our guests.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:14:12.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
