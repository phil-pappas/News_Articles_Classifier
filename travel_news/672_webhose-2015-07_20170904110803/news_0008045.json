The new name marks a step towards reflecting the Group's increasingly diversified airport hospitality businesses. We believe airports are a destination in themselves and our services and facilities will give travellers more reasons to enjoy their travel experience”, remarks Mr. Song Hoi-see, Founder and CEO of Plaza Premium Group. As a fast-growing airport hospitality brand, Plaza Premium Group currently provides an array of airport premium services in over 120 locations of 35 international airports and serves over 7 million travellers annually. On top of the sublime and opulent independent airport lounges that are in operation, the Group also manages lounges for leading airlines and alliances including Cathay Pacific Airways, Lufthansa Airlines, Korea Air, Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways, United Airlines and Skyteam. Riding on this rebranding opportunity, Plaza Premium Group adds two new brands, Aerotel and Allways, to its existing portfolio, consolidating the Group’s evolving businesses into four core pillars: Airport Lounge, Airport Transit Hotel, Airport Meet & Greet Service, and Airport Dining, to complement travellers’ overall airport experience. Aerotel, a unique line of airport transit hotels, promises travellers an unparalleled perspective of airport transit. Unlike traditional hotels, Aerotel is strategically designed by locating either inside or alongside airport terminals to provide exclusive oasis of tranquility, comfort and convenient accommodation for a refreshing and flexible stay. Striving to become the synonyms to top notch airport transit hotel, Aerotel will make its debut in Singapore Changi Airport and Abu Dhabi International Airport later this year, with subsequent opening in London Heathrow Airport in 2016. In addition, Plaza Premium Group introduces a new brand Allways to provide discerning travellers with a seamless airport meet & greet experience, from kerb to apron and apron to kerb in a breeze. Whatever travel request one can wish for, from welcome gifts, one-stop pick-ups, lounge stays, buggy service, baggage handling, limousine transfers to restaurant and itinerary recommendations, travellers can unfailingly be assured at Allways. The Group is launching Allways by phases in seven airports, with this exclusive service being on offer at Toronto Pearson International Airport and New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport, to be followed by airports in Singapore, Macau, Kuala Lumpur, Muscat and London Heathrow. “We strongly believe the travel experience begins the moment you step into the airport and that airport transit is a journey in itself, what we endeavor to create is a unique experience of ultimate comfort, convenience, value as well as love and care from our team, we design every service meticulously with this formula in mind”, Mr. Song says. Thanks to the unwavering support of all business partners in the past 17 years, more awards have been received including the most recent “Certificate of Appreciation” under the categories of ‘Corporate Excellent Award’, ‘Cross-company Excellence Award’, and ‘Individual Excellence Award’ presented by Airport Authority Hong Kong today in recognition of service excellence of the Group. To live up to the belief that airports are a destination in themselves, the Group unfolds its expansion plan of achieving a total of 200 locations by 2018, encompassing management and operation of independent and airline lounges, transit hotels, meet and greet service locations, and dining facilities.
