(Nasdaq:AAWW) today announced adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders of $29.4 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2015, compared with $15.9 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2014. On a reported basis, net income attributable to common stockholders in the second quarter of 2015 totaled $28.4 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, compared with $29.6 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Free cash flow of $68.5 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared with $59.2 million in the second quarter of 2014. \"Earnings in the second quarter were driven by contribution and margin strength in ACMI, Charter and Dry Leasing,\" said William J. Flynn, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We are seeing good demand for our aircraft and services as we enter the second half of 2015, as many of our customers are outperforming the overall market. We are working closely with our customers to provide them with the most efficient aircraft and effective operating services for their needs. \"As we gather additional insight into second-half demand, yields and military requirements, we continue to look forward to a strong year and a significant increase in earnings compared with 2014.\"Responding to market demand and customer requirements, we are implementing several previously announced fleet initiatives that are incorporated in our framework outlook for the year: placing an additional 747-400 freighter in ACMI service with DHL Express at the start of the third quarter; acquiring a new 747-8 freighter scheduled to be delivered to us in November; returning an owned, unencumbered 747-400 converted freighter to active service to meet additional Charter demand; securing a short-term operating lease on a second 747-400 converted freighter in Charter with more favorable terms; and expanding our Titan Dry Leasing portfolio by acquiring and converting two 767 passenger aircraft into freighter configuration. The freighters will be leased to DHL on a long-term basis when they are delivered in the fourth quarter. 1 of 8", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:42:27.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
