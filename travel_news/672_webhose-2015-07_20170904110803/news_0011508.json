Take to the outdoors by paddling the Potomac River, running through a spray fountain in Georgetown, soaking in a splash pool and then cheering on the Nationals during a baseball game. Then head for an air-conditioned, indoor beach of balls at the National Building Museum. Paddle the Potomac River Paddling on the Potomac River affords sweeping views of the citys skyline. Glide by the Lincoln Memorial and the Kennedy Center and row to Theodore Roosevelt Island. Thompson Boat Center, long a resource for paddling on the Potomac, rents single and double kayaks as well as two-person canoes, Sunfish sailboats and rowing shells. If the weathers warm, the day sunny and your grade-schoolers and teens tired of museum hopping, time on the water can be a lovely treat. All are available by the hour or by the day except for sailboats which rent only by the hour. Most rentals are on a first-come, first-served basis. Cool Off at Georgetowns Spray Park Back on land catch the breeze off the river at Georgetown Waterfront Park at the foot of M Street NW. The park features green lawns and benches overlooking the river plus a spray fountain whose rows of synchronized sprays form an arc. To get just your toes wet, run through the highest point; to get soaked, walk through the jets. Either way, its great fun on a hot day. And free. Soak in Yards Park and Root for the Nationals Get tickets to see the Nationals play baseball, but arrive early so you can enjoy Yards Park, which is connected to the stadium by a walkway fronting the Anacostia River. Stroll the boardwalk with its view of the Navy ships and relax on the wooden chaise lounges in the shady garden area. The piece de resistance: the 66,000-gallon canal basin soaking pool. Only 11-inches deep, the pool is perfect for splashing. Be sure to bring a bathing suit, a towel and a change of clothing for the game. Yards Park is free. Swim at the National Building Museum Let your kids dive into a beach made up of 1 million plastic balls at the National Building Museum. From the beach chairs edging the exhibit, you can watch your kids roll around, float and swim in the mega-ball pit designed by Snarkitecture. Better yet, dive in and giggle with your kids. The summer treat opened July 4 and runs through Labor Day.
