The clinics are a joint collaboration between Manchester City Football Club and the club’s principal partner Etihad Airways. \nIn Australia, clinics were held at Oakleigh Cannons Football Club and City Football Academy in Melbourne and Boondall State School and Moggill Football Club in Brisbane. \nEtihad Airways’ Chief Commercial Officer, Peter Baumgartner, said the airline was pleased to give back to the community through its partnership with MCFC. \n“These clinics are an excellent opportunity for Etihad Airways to make a positive contribution to the community and to give back to a market which has been so supportive of the airline. \n“It is our intention that each child will benefit from lessons in team work and will be encouraged to live an active, healthy lifestyle.” Oakleigh Cannons Football Club Chairman, Kon Kavalakis, said participating in the Manchester City Coaching Clinics was an exciting opportunity for the club. \n“The kids from Oakleigh Cannons Football Club were over the moon about training with coaches from Manchester City Football Club. For a young football fan, there aren’t many things more exciting than getting training tips and advice from coaches who are affiliated with the 2013/14 Barclays Premier League Champions. \n“The kids walked away from the clinic very inspired and it was wonderful to see them so enthusiastic about the sport. \n“This has been an excellent motivator and has encouraged our players to continue honing their skills and pursuing their love of soccer to become the stars of tomorrow.” \nManchester City Coaching Clinics Head Coach, Simon Hewitt, said the club was delighted to bring the successful clinics to Melbourne and Brisbane. \n“Etihad Soccer School has enjoyed huge success across the world and we are delighted to bring the clinics to Australia. The response over the last two weeks has been truly overwhelming.” \n“Manchester City Football Club is honoured to share its knowledge, skills and coaching techniques and to inspire talented young people to pursue their passion for soccer.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T09:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T09:49:44.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
