By John Lumpkin ASSOCIATED PRESS • Sunday July 26, 2015 5:00 AM \nINGONISH BEACH, Nova Scotia — Rounding a curve on the Cabot Trail, motorists can see an elongated pile of granite jutting toward the Atlantic Ocean. \nIt’s called Middle Head, and it’s part of Cape Breton Highlands National Park on Nova Scotia’s Cape Breton Island. The views from here are stunning, whether a sandy beach below or brooding Cape Smokey (a mountain) above. \nAt Middle Head’s entrance is the 75-year-old Keltic Resort, which can serve as a well-appointed base camp for exploring the 370-square-mile national park and the Cabot Trail, a ring road. \nReminiscent of Ireland’s formidable Ring of Kerry, Cabot Trail’s 185-mile route clings to cliffs, plunges into deep native forests and connects small coastal communities whose heritage comes from French, Scottish, Irish and British settlers, as well as the Mi’kmaq, the region’s indigenous people. Highway signs might be in French, Gaelic or English. \nNavigating sharp bends and steep descents, motorists can stop at numerous “look-offs” that might be safer than gawking through the windshield. Birds are abundant, marine life can be observed during offshore tours, and a moose or two might materialize. \nOne difference between the Ring of Kerry and its Canadian counterpart is the crowds. Here, tour buses are rare and other traffic is light. Just make sure you know where the gas stations are. \nMiddle Head once served as a seasonal home to small bands of fishermen. It was later owned by an Akron industrialist, Henry Clay Corson, who fell in love with the region while visiting the nearby summer retreat of a friend, telephone inventor Alexander Graham Bell. Corson’s widow sold the property in the 1940s to be developed as part of the park. \nAlong the Cabot Trail, an extraordinary club sandwich is served at the unpretentious Seagull Restaurant near the Keltic Resort. It is packed with chunks of locally caught lobster, smoked bacon and summer-fresh lettuce and tomato on crusty toast. The chowder is prepared daily by the octogenarian owner, John Dan Jobes. In his broth could be crab, scallops, salmon, mackerel, cod or halibut. \nJobes “is somewhat of a local legend,” says Jessica Young of Keltic Resort. “Whenever I go to the Seagull, I usually see him in his apron, greeting guests warmly before heading back to the kitchen.” \nUp the highway is the Chowder House in Neil’s Harbour, a fishing village with stacks of lobster traps on its wharfs. The 16 indoor picnic tables were crammed before noon on a weekday in August with offerings of lobster sandwiches, crab cakes and both clam and seafood chowder. Its mussels could have been harvested that morning from Cape North, near where explorers John and Sebastian Cabot were said to have landed in 1497. \nWorking up an appetite is not difficult. Hiking trails for different skill levels are plentiful throughout the park, including more than a half-dozen near its entrance at Ingonish Beach. One low-impact guided hike traverses Middle Head through trees and patches of knapweed, elderberry and wild daisies to its tip for a 270-degree panorama of the ocean and faraway jagged shorelines. \nSaid to be among the world’s top cycling destinations, Cape Breton Highlands has strategically placed campgrounds for longer Cabot Trail rides and several off-pavement trails. If you’re a hardy beachgoer, the late-summer Atlantic surf is chilly but tolerable. \nGolf at internationally ranked Highland Links adjacent to Keltic Resort can be arduous, if you walk rather than ride in a motorized cart. Opened in 1941, it is part of golf architect Stanley Thompson’s legendary Canadian portfolio, which includes Banff Springs in the western Rockies. Highland Links’ holes wind by the sea and twist through dense woodlands or border the Clyburn River. The trek from the first tee to the 18th green is 8 miles. \nWith what’s left of the day, you could attend a ceilidh at a local parish hall where musicians gather to play, or spend it in the Highland Sitting Room at Keltic, with ocean views, twin fireplaces and entertainers such as Jimmy Sweeney, a native of Northern Ireland. \nOne summer evening, he sang a mournful ballad about Irishmen who emigrated to find work in the 1960s. \n“It’s a long way from Clare to here,” the refrain goes, and that’s true of Cape Breton, but the sadness seems to have dissolved with the generations who came and stayed. \nIF YOU GO \nCabot Trail, Nova Scotia \nVisiting the Cabot Trail is advised to be a three- to five-day experience. \nNearby attractions include Cheticamp, a French-Acadian fishing village; the Bell Museum in Baddeck; Glenora Inn & Distillery in Glenville; and Stewiacke, which claims to be halfway between the equator and North Pole with a “halfway” sign in town. \nFor more information, visit www.cabottrail.travel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T16:25:43.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
