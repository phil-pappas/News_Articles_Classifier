More Guangzhou Evergrande eyes stock listing \nInside, however, the only remaining traces of its previous incarnation as a dingy country “boozer” are the fruit machine and the bar itself. \nOtherwise, the Crewe & Harpur is now a confection of pale wood and bric-a-brac, with a tall glass-fronted rotisserie oven that tempts customers with its glistening roast chickens. \n“We make three-quarters of our money on food, a quarter on drink,” says Cheryl Green, the manager. Plenty of pubs now serve food, but the Crewe & Harpur has become a restaurant that serves beer. \nFor Marston’s , this is at the core of its strategy. “This pub makes £27,000 net a week,” says Ralph Findlay, chief executive. “To do these numbers, to make the economics work, you cannot do that by being just a bar.” \nMarston’s share price is up more than 11 per cent over the past year and the company reported a 2 per cent rise in half-year underlying pre-tax profits to £29.6m in May, on revenues of £384.5m. Two years ago it started to overhaul its pub estate and appears to have found success with what is best described as a Trojan horse policy: pub on the outside, restaurant within. \nWhen Mr Findlay discusses his competition, he refers not just to fellow pub chains such as Greene King , but also to the expanding casual restaurant sector. \nMarston’s advantage, he says, is in smaller towns and cities where customers feel more comfortable in a pub than in a “faddish chain restaurant”. \n“I like that we are opening in places that are not fashionable,” Mr Findlay says. “We opened in Aberystwyth and we are doing £10,000 a week in a place with only just over 10,000 people. Everyone in town must be coming.” The average weekly take for managed pubs across Wales, which is skewed by the big cities, is £22,000, according to CGA Peach, a consultancy that monitors the eating and drinking-out industry. \n1,600 \nNumber of pubs in Marston’s estate \n“And the demographic there is not going to work for a Five Guys [the burger chain], a Smashburger or a Yo Sushi. We are leveraging the fact that it is a pub, and people’s expectation of that; that they will have a good time,” he adds. \nMarston’s began expanding its now 1,600-strong estate in 2009, raising money at a fraught time after the financial crisis. “We built up on the edges of new areas. At that time no one else was doing it, we had it to ourselves.” \nThe group still has 276 tenanted pubs — which are tied to the brewer — but is gradually buying back these tenancies. By the end of next year it will manage all its pubs in-house, meaning it will not be affected by rules being introduced to scrap the tied pub system . \nToday newbuilds are financed with sale-and-leaseback arrangements from the likes of Standard Life and Legal & General that run for 30 to 40 years. “It is 4.5 per cent money and we recoup the freehold at the end for nil cost,” says Mr Findlay. \nPhil Tate, CGA chief executive, says Marston’s is also targeting a different demographic by “making pubs more accessible and targeting families and people in their 40s and 50s”. \nThe company is also seeking to increase revenue from accommodation , with many of its out-of-town pubs also offering rooms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T17:29:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
