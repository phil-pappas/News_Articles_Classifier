Its trade wasn’t gaming — it was the military, specifically the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. At its height, Tule Lake Segregation Unit housed nearly 19,000 prisoners, making it the largest of 10 so-called War Relocation Centers across the rural American West. Among its inmates were the actor George Takei, the photographer Mary Koga and others who were known collectively as no-noes for their answers in a questionnaire meant to test loyalty. All that remains today is the squat concrete building that was the camp jail, and as I entered, Ranger Kenneth Doutt warned of bats, snakes and rats. Swinging his flashlight about, he pointed out steel bars embedded in the walls, and holes where rods once supported bunk beds. The light then pinpointed pencil etchings, mostly in Japanese.

I had come to the camp, which was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2006, during a weeklong journey last September across California’s proverbial Empty Quarter, the desolate northeast corner of the state adjacent to Oregon and Nevada. The trip had been on my mind for years, partly because the name sounded exotic, like the Rub’ al Khali, the Arabian Peninsula’s Empty Quarter, one of the world’s largest sand deserts. I had heard little about the region, though I remembered vaguely from grammar school that it was settled by Basque sheepherders in the 1870s, which also struck me as adventurous and romantic. It seemed the farthest afield you could get in California and still be within its borders. I was particularly keen to explore the area when I moved from Berlin, where I had lived for 14 years, back to Sacramento, where I had grown up, to be near my aging mother after the death of my father at the end of 2012. Fifty years earlier, my mother, an immigrant from Spain, and my father, from Hungary, had taken their first road trip together as newlyweds to Mount Shasta, and tooled around the edges of the Empty Quarter. I have creased and weathered black-and-white photos of that trip, showing them giddily poking out of the sunroof of their white Volkswagen Beetle, skis strapped to the backside. I was nostalgic for something that I barely knew. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story As I researched the Empty Quarter on my own, I learned about the State of Jefferson, a secessionist movement founded there in 1941 and still active, if only as a “protest of the mind,” as one observer put it. Encompassing the counties of Northern California and southern Oregon (with some joining and exiting since 1941), proponents seek to secede from their respective states so as “to form a state more representative of its customs, culture and heritage.” The journey seemed my reckoning: California’s wayward gypsy daughter was now circling back and reconciling herself to it. A country whose history reflects its noble ideals and its inability to live up to them is hard to come back to. Though my circumstances were far different from those in the camp, “Show me the way to go to home” kept ringing in my ears as I navigated the land. Photo Inside the Hercules Leg Cave at Lava Beds. Credit Drew Kelly for The New York Times The morning I was to leave, my mother told me she was anxious about my traveling alone in my 1997 Toyota RAV4. For her sake, I agreed to rent a car, but when we reached Budget, most had already been taken. I wandered to the back of the lot, itching to head out and annoyed with my late start, when my eyes fell on a white Volkswagen Beetle. At last, I was ready to roll. The first night, I stayed in Burney, Calif., an hour’s drive east of Interstate 5 and Redding. Driving into town, I saw dozens of signs paying tribute to firefighters. Flames had ravaged hundreds of square miles of national forest lands across the Shasta region. The drought hadn’t helped. I had wanted to stay in Burney so as to get an early start the next day to the waterfalls at McArthur-Burney Falls Memorial State Park. Upon entering, I was told by the ranger that this park, the second oldest in the state, is one of the most visited in Northern California; but that day, aside from an older couple at the observation platform to the falls, I was alone. It was late morning and already about 90 degrees, but as I descended toward the falls, past lava rock, ponderosa pines and Douglas firs, nature’s air-conditioning kicked in, with a mist and even a rainbow across the turquoise waters. The beer company Coors, I read, had once used the luscious waterfalls as a backdrop for ads. The Native Americans who had lived here had christened them “laughing waters.” And now I stood admiring the millions of gallons of water cascading over the 129-foot drop of mossy rock into the emerald pool. It was hard to believe a drought was suffocating the rest of the state. But it was, and the Modoc Plateau was in the throes of it. Leaving the falls, I first cruised through the Modoc National Forest, which abruptly gave way to a hazy bowl-like valley. Getting closer, I saw a patchwork of golden wheat fields and miles of green alfalfa, and sagebrush, thickets of pine and fir, cattle herds and iron Daisy windmills.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T08:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T09:01:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
