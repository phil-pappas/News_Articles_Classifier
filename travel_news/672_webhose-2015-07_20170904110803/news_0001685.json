On the guest list are:\nFirst class passengers of Star Alliance airlines departing from TBIT, currently including Air China, ANA, Asiana Airlines, Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines and SWISS Virgin Australia Velocity Platinum members travelling to Sydney or Brisbane with Virgin Australia As if that weren't restrictive enough, further secluded are two private rooms – practically 'lounges within the lounge' – available to VIPs, Air New Zealand Elite Priority One guests and members of The Club , Virgin Australia's by-invitation tier to rival the Qantas Chairman's Lounge .\nYou'll spot one of the doors blended into the blue wall below:\nInside, they serve as quiet places to relax...\n... watch TV or enjoy your favourite food and drinks, which the staff can have waiting for your arrival.\nA divider can also be opened to transform the two private rooms into one larger room as needed.\nDining Lounge guests can help themselves to a modest buffet of snacks and nibbles – mostly consisting of desserts and fruit during our evening visit...\n... and to a selection of soft drinks, spirits, wine and champagne.\nIn the bubbly department is a choice of Beau Joie Brut (NV), and our preferred drop: G.H. Mumm Cordon Rouge Brut (NV).\nFor more substantial meals and desserts, take a seat at the dining tables – conveniently close to the champagne...\n... and place your order from the a la carte menu:\nThe dishes are small enough that you can sample several in the one sitting, or can enjoy something little without feeling compelled to eat an entire plate of food: a fitting choice before Virgin Australia's 10:20pm departure to Sydney or the later 11:50pm service to Brisbane.\nWe kept things simple, ordering up a very tasty Bradley Burger with turkey, cranberry mayonnaise, Swiss cheese, green leaves and tomato with root chips on the side...\n... followed by the Brittany crêpe for dessert – and yes, it's as scrumptious as it looks.\nTop marks for service, presentation, taste, portion size and speed.\nWork Wherever you look AC and USB power points are plentiful and pop out from the cocktail tables with a gentle press:\nThere's also fast and free Wi-Fi, and plenty of space around each seat for your drinks and snacks – either on each side...\n... or on the table in front:\nThe armrests on the chairs above are at a perfect height for laptop work, although there are no traditional desks and office chairs that are more comfortable during longer periods.\nYou could certainly use your laptop in the dining area, but the four dining tables would be more courteously kept for hungry travellers.\nRelax Enjoying a beverage in the Star Alliance first class lounge is quite a relaxing way to spend an evening, especially when it's quiet.\nBut to truly unwind, make a visit to the adjacent business class lounge and its heated rooftop terrace: offering a BBQ-like environment and views of the tarmac.\nOddly, you'll also need to duck next door to use one of eight shower suites, available on a first-come, first-served basis.\nFor a first class lounge that's otherwise so privacy-centric, having to leave that bubble and nip into the business lounge for a shower isn't the greatest setup, although there was fortunately no queue during our evening visit.\nReturning to the first class lounge afterwards is easy: there's a shortcut door in between the two lounges, but which requires a PIN if you're moving from business class to first class. (You'll find the current re-entry PIN on the dining menu, next to the Wi-Fi password.)\nBut once you're back inside, all that's left to do is nurse a glass of champagne or three until your flight is ready for boarding.\nAlso read: Virgin Australia business class review: Brisbane-Los Angeles\nChris Chamberlin travelled to Los Angeles as a guest of Virgin Australia.\n Chris Chamberlin Chris lives by the motto that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, a great latte, an opera ticket and a glass of wine!\nFollow @ausbt on Email: @MusoJournoChris\nGoogle+: Chris Chamberlin Share this Review Related Reviews Star Alliance business class lounge LAX Air NZ, Star Alliance lounge Sydney Airport Virgin Australia's Canberra lounge have -7 report reply 1 14 hours, 37 minutes ago by TomGoddardd\nDoesn't look very nice compared to some of the other First lounges, a bit bland\n9 report reply 1 13 hours, 4 minutes ago by Michael As Chris suggested in the article, many first class lounge just offer privacy, peace and quiet rather than lots of blings of services. For award traveler like me, of course I like more blings, but obviously I am not the target customer the airlines are aiming for, but rather we are talking about CEOs, celebrities and politicians. I can't imagine Leonardo Dicaprio would care to have complimentary spa treatment.\n2 report reply 2 14 hours, 4 minutes ago by tmk I don't understand, why do Air NZ run a lounge only available to guests travelling in first class when they don't even offer first class?\n8 report reply 1 13 hours, 51 minutes ago by Chris It's not an 'Air New Zealand lounge', per se, rather a branded 'Star Alliance lounge' run by Air NZ on behalf of every Star Alliance airline flying from that terminal.\nWhile NZ doesn't offer first class on its flights to Los Angeles, other Star Alliance airlines do have first class and would expect a separate lounge in such a major city.\n(That, and both Oneworld via Qantas and SkyTeam via Korean Air have separate first class lounges for first class passengers in the same terminal at LAX, so there's a lot of competition.)\n4 report reply 1 12 hours, 50 minutes ago by aviation Futher to Chris' comments, Air NZ run the entire lounge (i.e. the business and first lounges). It wouldn't make sense having them run the business lounge and someone else the first lounge.\n3 report reply 3 9 hours, 43 minutes ago by PK Unsurprisingly, the airline world is getting complicated again a bit more than a decade after global alliances were meant to make things more streamlined. Here, the best chance to access a first class Star Alliance lounge goes to frequent flyers of an airline that is not even a member of Star Alliance, because the first class lounge is being run by it shareholder, which does not offer a first class cabin and doesn't offer entry to its own non-VIP frequent flyers, in order to help the entity it holds shares in against a domestic competitor.\n2 report reply 1 8 hours, 58 minutes ago by Dean To be fair though, the access policies for actual Star Alliance passengers follow the normal Star Alliance rules... if Star thinks it's unfair, then they can change their own rules (and maybe make that Star Alliance Platinum tier they were talking about - fingers crossed)!\n2 report reply 4 4 hours ago by James88 Why doesn't Air New Zealand give their Elite members access to the first class lounge? If Virgin Australia Velocity Platinum members get access to it, Air New Zealand Elite members should get access too; after all it is Air New Zealand's lounge.\n-2 report reply 1 3 hours, 52 minutes ago by aviation As mentioned above, it isn't an Air NZ lounge, it is a Star Alliance lounge. Both Air NZ Elite and Gold guests have the equivilant of Star Alliance Gold status, so if they were allowed to enter the First Class lounge, then every single Star Alliance Gold would be able to.\nThere is obviously a separate agreement in place for Velocity Platinum access, which Virgin could well be paying extra for.", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/AusBT", "http://chrischamberlin.com.au/follow-on-google-plus/?rel=author", "http://twitter.com/#!/MusoJournoChris", "http://twitter.com/#!/ausbt"], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T18:08:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
