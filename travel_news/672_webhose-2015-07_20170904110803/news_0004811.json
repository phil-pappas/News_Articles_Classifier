Newsweek, formerly owned by The Washington Post Co., ceased print publication at the end of 2012 before being revived under a new owner. Another Washington-based newsweekly, U.S. News & World Report, began to phase out print publication in 2008 and moved entirely to digital publishing in 2010.\nAt the same time, National Journal’s franchise as a purveyor of long-form stories about politics and policy has been beset by a host of speedy new Web-based competitors, such as Politico, Talking Points Memo, Huffington Post and Real Clear Politics .\nThe magazine was founded by the late journalist Thomas Schroth and has been through several changes of ownership since it began in 1969. Bradley’s privately owned Atlantic Media, headquartered in Washington’s Watergate complex, acquired it 1997.\nIn a show of public contrition rare for a media executive, Bradley blamed himself for the publication’s demise. “I believe I failed,” he wrote. “When I first entered publishing, [former Washington Post Co. chief executive] Don Graham taught me his motto: ‘Eyes on, hands off.’ A few years back . . . I took both my eyes and hands off the task. In the long run, I don’t think a weekly print magazine can thrive. Still, had I not failed for a time in my role, I think National Journal might have prospered longer.”\nHe added, “At a minimum, I don’t assign any fault to our editors and writers. The problems here were strategic — and mine entirely.”\nStarting in 2011, National Journal Group began selling memberships, rather than subscriptions, that entitled customers to the magazine, unlimited Web site access, proprietary charts and graphics, and entry to events. The company has about 1,000 members — corporations, government offices, trade associations — that pay an annual fee based on size, typically four or five figures.\nDespite what he called National Journal’s “gentle decline,” Bradley said the company overall was financially healthy and growing.\nThe magazine’s closure won’t result in direct layoffs. Its staff of 10 to 15 — some employees hold dual roles within the group — will be reassigned to other parts of the company, which has about 80 employees overall. Although Bradley said that the number of positions would be reduced, he added an apology and wrote, “I have never left anyone ‘on the street.’ I won’t do that here.”\nThe magazine’s editor, Richard Just , declined to be interviewed, as did Tim Grieve , its editor in chief. But Just said in a statement, “Starting in the spring of 2014, we built a magazine of storytelling and ideas that we could all be proud of — and, while I understand that this is a business decision, I am disappointed to see the magazine ending at a moment when I believe it is, by any standard, thriving journalistically.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@farhip", "http://www.nationaljournal.com/reporters/bio/188", "http://talkingpointsmemo.com/", "http://www.nationaljournal.com/", "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/05/us/05schroth.html", "http://www.politico.com/", "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/", "http://www.nationaljournal.com/reporters/bio/218"], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T02:50:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
