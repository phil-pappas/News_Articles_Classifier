Another 48% don’t feel that screenings are an effective deterrent to hijacking.\nHowever, the poll did find that the more travelers are screened, the more likely they are to see TSA as making air travelers safer and serving as an effective deterrent to hijacking , versus those who don’t travel as much.\nPersonally, I am a fan of the TSA PreCheck line, which allows travelers to go through a special line that allows you to keep on your shoes and keep laptop computers in their bags. The Harris poll found that six in 10 Americans have heard of the program, while one third are somewhat familiar with it. Only 2% said they were already either participants or applicants.\nThose polled strongly believe that PreCheck requirements should include:\nPassing a criminal background check (76%)\nSubmitting to a fingerprint scan (73%)\nHolding U.S. citizenship (70%)\nAn analysis of past travel habits (56%)\nPassing a drug test (37%)\nA check of family and social connections (35%)\nTSA charges $85 for five years to join PreCheck When asked what expedited airport screening might be worth to them (in the form of a one-time application fee), those who have traveled by airline in the past year indicate a willingness to pay roughly $50, on average. Among those who have taken over five trips in the past year that figure goes up to about $77.\nHowever, only two in 10 air travelers (19%) and three in 10 more frequent flyers (29%) would pay $85 or more.\nMixed Feelings\nThe poll found Americans have mixed feelings about PreCheck, with things they like about it but some concerns as well. On the one hand, nearly 80% of those polled feel separating out pre-screened passengers into a different line will make the screening process quicker for everyone, while only 30% believe the qualifications for the program infringe on applicants' privacy.\nBut on the other hand, nearly 70% are concerned that lessening security procedures for some passengers through the TSA's PreCheck program will result in missing potential threats and more than half don't think it's fair to treat passengers differently from one another. The poll surveyed 2,234 adults sureyed online between March 12 and 17, 2014.", "external_links": ["http://www.harrisinteractive.com/NewsRoom/HarrisPolls/tabid/447/ctl/ReadCustom%20Default/mid/1508/ArticleId/1419/Default.aspx", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/Q/I/465461717.jpg", "http://www.tsa.gov/tsa-precheck", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/W/Q/I/465461717.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T07:13:19.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
