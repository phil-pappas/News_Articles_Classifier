The Chicago, New York and St. Louis legs have been cancelled.\nRefunds will be available. No reason was given for the show's abrupt cancellation.\nIt's another black eye for co-producers Michael Cohl and Jeremiah J. Harris, whose \"Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark\" was a costly failure on Broadway. Hero Ventures, a Los Angeles-based entertainment company, and Marvel Entertainment also produced the tour.\nThe $30 million show had previously made stops in Phoenix, Dallas and San Diego before being retooled for the current run.\n___\nOnline: https://themarvelexperiencetour.com\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T10:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T16:47:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
