The company currently provides PMS technology to 1,800 properties worldwide. \n\n“Integrating the Itesso ELS as a key module of Amadeus’ cloud-based platform for the hotel industry opens up a whole new spectrum of possibilities for our customers – current and future,” said Bas Blommaart, managing director of Itesso.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T11:41:54.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
