(Illumination Entertainment/Universal Pictures) 6 and older Minions (PG) Consistently amusing, if not consistently hilarious, “Minions” will give kids 6 and older the giggles over the pratfalls and general silliness of the rubbery, banana-yellow creatures. Adults will savor the multi-layered jokes and ’60s soundtrack. From their bodies to their begoggled eyeballs, their nonsense speech (mixed with scraps of the Romance languages) and their big emotions, the Minions are irresistible despite their need to serve great villains. The plot gets too twisty in the third act, but kids will keep up: First, we learn Minion “pre-Gru” history — their evolution from the primordial ooze onward, serving bad-guy dinosaurs, cavemen, vampires and even Napoleon, then banished to an Arctic cavern. Finally, Kevin, Bob and one-eyed Stuart venture out to find a new villainous boss. They land in 1960s New York, hitchhike with a family of bank robbers to “Villain Con” in Orlando and meet Scarlet Overkill (voiced by Sandra Bullock), who hires them to steal Queen Elizabeth II’s crown in London. (91 minutes)\nTHE BOTTOM LINE:  A couple of gags involve mild toilet humor. There are Abominable Snowmen and bears. Scarlet’s husband tries to torture Kevin, Bob and Stuart, but it feels nice to their squishy selves. A chandelier falls and maybe kills someone. There is a big explosion. Rodent phobics note: There’s a sewer rat.\n[ Minions have taken over the world, and my kid ]\nAfter Riley's family moves, her emotions; Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness; must decide how to adjust to a new city, house and school. (Walt Disney Pictures) 8 and older Inside Out (PG) Funny and inventive on all levels, “Inside Out” takes risks for a mainstream animated movie. It deals with depression in a child — real, if temporary, depression. Yet, although the story veers now and then into gloom, it is more often a hoot, and fine for kids 8 and older. How children perceive it will depend on their age and experience, but they’ll enjoy it. The tale unfolds mostly inside the brain of 11-year-old Riley — in her emotional control center, which looks like the bridge of the Starship Enterprise. At the helm is Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler), who oversees Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger and keeps them in check. But Riley’s family has just moved, leaving her friends behind. Sadness starts to lose Riley’s core happy memories. So Joy drags Sadness into the amazing wilds of Riley’s brain to retrieve them. (94 minutes)\nTHE BOTTOM LINE:  Some older kids could be unsettled by the idea that Riley’s personality could crumble if her depression doesn’t lift. Younger kids may just see it as a simple adventure.\nPG-13 Self/less Many teens will be intrigued by “Self/less” and reasonably forgiving of its flaws. It is, nevertheless, an identity-switch thriller that suffers from its own identity crisis. The film starts with a strong psychological/sci-fi premise but degrades into a cliched patchwork of fights, chases and gunplay. The mayhem is intense for PG-13, although not gory. Steamy sexual content early on, while stylized and not explicit, may be inappropriate for some middle-schoolers. Ben Kingsley plays Damian, a terminally ill billionaire unwilling to let go of life or lucre. A secretive medical genius, Albright (Matthew Goode), offers to transfer Damian’s intellect and personality into a young, healthy body for a mere $250 million. Ryan Reynolds plays the re-bodied Damian, recuperating under the watchful eyes of Albright’s not-so-benign minders. Although delighted with his new self, Damian starts to experience flashbacks from a young man’s life, complete with a military career and a wife and child. He escapes to go learn the truth. (117 minutes)\nTHE BOTTOM LINE:  The fights, shootouts and chases push the\nPG-13 envelope in terms of frequency and intensity. As he adjusts to his new body, Damian picks up women; the sexual encounters are steamy but stylized and non-explicit. The F-word is used as an epithet at least once.\nThe year is 2029, and John Connor, leader of the resistance continues the war against the machines. Directed by Alan Taylor and starring Emilia Clarke, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jai Courtney and Jason Clarke. (Paramount Pictures) Terminator Genisys Time travel plays an even bigger role than before in this long but witty reboot of the “Terminator” franchise. It’s full of action but rich in character as well. Teens into sci-fi thrillers should have a good time, even if they don’t know all of the earlier films. The script offers frequent clarifications, often courtesy of the original “I’ll be back” Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), whose human outer shell has conveniently aged despite his robotic innards. The narrative shifts from 2029 to 1984 and years in between. Our narrator, Kyle Reese, a character from the first and fourth films, recounts the rise of Skynet and how its operating system unleashed nukes that killed 3 billion people. That became known as Judgment Day. John Connor has led an insurgency against the Skynet machines ever since. He rescued Kyle as a little boy and raised him to fight. Kyle travels from 2029 to 1984 (when the first film was set) to save Sarah Connor so that she may give birth to the hero, John. Kyle is shocked that Sarah has made a friend of the Terminator sent by Skynet to kill her. The three must now traverse time to prevent Judgment Day. (125 minutes)\nTHE BOTTOM LINE:  The fights don’t involve much blood, but there’s plenty of head-banging. Terminators get holes in their flesh or metallic skeletons, but they heal instantly. Nudity is implied in all time-travel scenes. There is one use of the F-word, but the rest of the dialogue is only moderately profane. The nuclear holocaust images are disturbing.\nR\nThe Gallows A quartet of irritating fictional high-school students inhabit this low-budget horror film — another “found footage” scarefest made of shaky video “shot” by one of the characters. Real-life high-schoolers may get a wicked hoot out of the movie’s over-the-top portrayal of teen sniping and rivalries. While utterly predictable, the scary bits do make one jump now and then, thanks to those low-budget standbys faulty lighting, locked doors, creepy sounds and shadowy figures. The prologue is an old video of a 1993 high-school play called “The Gallows,” in which a boy died when the prop gallows malfunctioned. Twenty years later, the same school is rehearsing a remount of the play, intended as a memorial. Reese, the leading man, is awkward on stage, and his pal, Ryan, hates that his friend gave up sports to be in such a stilted period piece opposite drama diva Pfeifer. Ryan slams the theater nerds with verbal vitriol, documenting it all on cell phone video. He then gets his girlfriend and Reese to break into the auditorium with him at night to trash the scenery. Things get lethal once they’re in. (81 minutes)\nTHE BOTTOM LINE: The R rating reflects tension and sudden, mostly implied, violence. Characters may glimpse a hooded figure and then be snatched up, by implication, to their deaths by hanging. Welts and bruises appear on a girl’s neck. A guy’s leg seems twisted, but jeans hide the break. The script uses mild sexual innuendo and profanity.\nHorwitz is a freelance writer.", "external_links": ["http://s3.amazonaws.com/posttv-thumbnails-prod/thumbnails/55818e78e4b0a80f185350f7/20150617_InsideOutTrailer.jpg", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/posttv-thumbnails-prod/thumbnails/20141204/5480d517e4b08e52b2b90a55/terminator.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T19:07:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
