The conference and events arm of the RIBA (Royal Institute of British Architects) in central London saw a 63% increase in corporate dinners, 46% increase in conferences and a 30% increase in meetings between January and April 2015. Larger events were also on the rise with 25% more delegates attending events at RIBA Venues during this period. \nThe majority of the increase in events business has come from the publishing and retail sectors. Architecture, legal, association, media, and government are also strong sectors for the venue. RIBA Venues’ Head of Venues, Stephanie Ellrott, says: “These great figures show real ROI following our recent refurbishment offering the ability to host larger events for up to 400 people. “Our venues team has worked hard to build strong relationships with our clients to retain our repeat business and thanks to our increased proactive approach we increased our new business by 783%. “We look forward to continuing on this road and attracting a varied programme of events for the rest of the year with demand for Christmas Parties and Fashion shows being on the rise.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T16:02:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
