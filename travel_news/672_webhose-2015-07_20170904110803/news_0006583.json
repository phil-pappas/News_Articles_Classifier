They saw wonders that include the Star Spangled Banner, the Hope Diamond and mummies. However, many of them did not see the millions of dollars of work going on behind the scenes. Washington, DC - infoZine - Scripps Howard Foundation Wire - This year the Smithsonian’s 19 museums, 20 libraries and nine research centers requested $820 million from Congress. Just over 12 percent, $103 million, of that money is going to new and ongoing major renovations at eight buildings. While the price tag is higher than in past years, Debra Nauta-Rodriguez, deputy director for the Planning and Program Management, said the amount of work is not unusual. “We have major realization of our existing buildings going on every year,” Rodriguez said. “We are using every penny, and we could use more.” These are projects are considered to be the highest priority by the Smithsonian: National Museum of Natural History Cari Corrigan, a geologist at the Natural History Museum, shows a piece of a meteorite that fell in Lorton, Va., in 2010. The meteorite joined several other artifacts on display at a June 17 House hearing on the priorities of the Smithsonian Institution. SHFWire photo by Sarah Fulton Due to the price tag, Smithsonian spokeswomen Linda St. Thomas said, the organization’s first priority is ongoing renovations at the National Museum of Natural History. This year renovations at the million square foot building are slated to cost $22.9 million. Current projects include updating the heating and air conditioning systems, removing asbestos from utility tunnels and replacing the electrical systems. According to the 2015 federal budget request, the heating and air conditioning system frequently breaks down and does not provide adequate air quality for collections or visitors. Pipes in the utility tunnels contain asbestos and prevent workers from performing adequate maintenance. The building’s electricity is system is “antiquated.” “We are updating those internal systems floor by floor and area by area. We are continuing on our journey through that building,” Rodriguez said. “Each year we do a couple of major problems. This year we are finishing the electrical piece.” The Hall of Paleobiology, which houses the institution’s dinosaur bones, has also been closed for a $48 million renovation since April 2014. It is scheduled to reopen in 2019. National Zoo Since 2005, the foundation of the General Services Building at the National Zoo has been cracking and allowing water into the building. The building houses offices that help care for the zoo’s 1,800 animals – animal nutrition commissary, office space, horticulture department and some exhibits. Steven Sumner, National Zoo program executive, said in an email statement that the project is on time and on budget. The $10 million in renovations include repairing the steel reinforcing of the building and filling cracked concrete. An additional $5.75 million project will install smoke-evacuation equipment and improve utilities such as plumbing. Renwick Gallery If renovations continue as scheduled, the Renwick Gallery will open in November after being closed for two years. Improvements to the 1858 building are being made to everything from the electrical system to the roof. The final funding of $7.5 million is being split between federal funding and trust fund resources.
