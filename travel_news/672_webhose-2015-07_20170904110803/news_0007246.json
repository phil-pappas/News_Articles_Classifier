On Britain's extensive system of canals, rivers, lakes, lochs and surrounding seas, paddle-powered canoes and kayaks are to larger, more cumbersome boats what bikes are to cars. Not only a wonderful way to hone your core fitness and work on your skill, confidence, balance and dexterity on water, these floating devices can get you to places you would otherwise have never reached. What's more, canoeing and kayaking are ideal for combining with any other outdoorsy pursuits that float your boat – such as climbing, cycling, hiking, nature trailing, camping or even caravanning. But first of all, the answer to the most frequently asked question: what’s the difference between the two disciplines? The main two are how you sit and what type of paddle you use. Canoeists, often in pairs, traditionally kneel and use a single-bladed paddle, while kayaking – the more common of the two – is done from a sunken, seated position with a double-bladed paddle and usually with a “spray deck” to keep the water out of the cockpit. Both paddle sports are said to boost cardiovascular fitness, strengthen the upper body, improve mental health, reduce body fat and encourage core strength. So besides the beginner’s blisters and calluses on your palms, what's not to like? To kayak to the best of your ability, you'll need to hone your paddle grip, employ a smooth stroke and keep your shoulders relaxed but your body upright to maintain the boat's balance. Core abdominals and back muscles are key, while your feet help you transfer power from your body through the kayak to propel it forward. From simple touring on placid water to demanding white-water descents and coastal challenges, the UK is a veritable hotbed for kayaking and canoeing, thanks to thousands of miles of rivers and canals - not to mention a stunning coastline and countless lakes. But remember: you will need a licence to paddle on Britain's inland waterways. These can be obtained as part of the British Canoe Union (BCU) membership, or from one of the three organisations that run Britain's waterways: the Canal & River Trust , the Environment Agency and the Broads Authority . To try your paddling hand at some more challenging white-water opportunities – including the slalom and sprint racing enjoyed by so many of us during the Olympics – then it's worth checking out the Welsh National White Water Centre in north Wales or the Lee Valley White Water Centre near London , which hosted many of the London 2012 canoeing and kayaking events. There are other designated facilities in Nene, Teeside, Cardington, the River Washburn in North Yorkshire and the National Water Sports Centre in Nottingham . The National Trust website has a subsection on canoeing and kayaking with a list of top ten places to explore creeks, estuaries, coastline, canals, lakes and rivers at swan's-eye level in the UK. Canoe & Kayak UK is a great paddle portal with features, reviews, an interactive forum and extensive guides, while On The Water boasts a raft of ideas and tips about all forms of floating activity. It doesn't stop there. Canoe England has a brilliant interactive map of places to canoe of varying difficulty and experience, while Go Canoeing is a one-stop-shop for both prospective paddlers and experienced floaters – and also allows you to bring up your nearest canoe or kayak location according to postcode and experience. Finally, don't let living in a big city put you off: groups for both kayaking ( www.kayakinglondon.com ) and canoeing ( canoelondon.com ) can be joined along the tidal Thames and through the heart of London. And if you really catch the bug, then the annual Devizes to Westminster International Canoe Race takes place over the Easter bank holiday, running from the market town in Wiltshire to the Houses of Parliament. That should whip you into shape in no time!
