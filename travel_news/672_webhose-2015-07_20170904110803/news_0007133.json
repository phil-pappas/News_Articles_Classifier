A poll of 1,598 Which? members with children or grandchildren found that the bank of gran and grandad plays a significant role in the lives of many students. The research found that 72 per cent of grandparents are giving financial support to young people at university. Could you be helping out your grandchildren with their university costs? (Alamy) Which? revealed that pensioners across the country are spending an average of £146 a month contributing to their grandchildren's expenses. This money is being spent on student gadgets, accommodation costs and living expenses, according to the survey. Parents, the research found, cough up an average of £363 a month. Patricia Smith and her husband Geoff from Warwickshire, gave their eldest granddaughter Victoria, the first of their four grandchildren to go university, a £200 a month allowance to supplement her student loan.

(Alamy) Four in ten of those polled by Which? said they wanted to invest in their grandchild's future, while a fifth had already given support to another grandchild. According to Which? the top concern shared by parents and grandparents of students intending to go to university in the next five years was a loved one leaving university with debt. 35 per cent of those surveyed said that their child or grandchild could not afford to go to university without their help. Without the financial support of her parents and grandparents, being a student would have been much harder, Victoria admits. \"I wouldn't have been able to enjoy myself half as much were it not for the kindness of my family. I know how lucky I was to be in that position.\" Do you give financial support to your grandchildren?
