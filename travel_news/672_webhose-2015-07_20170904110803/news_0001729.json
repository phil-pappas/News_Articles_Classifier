There’s the discussion about the fees and required check-out time or maybe an electronic check-in involving no human contact at all.\nThat’s why the U-Lounge is so special. This exclusive, new service is available at select properties in the Unlimited Vacation Club (UVC) by AMResorts portfolio. With its plush U-Lounge and personalized attention, this vacation club extends a warm welcome to arriving members the moment they walk through the front door.\nHere’s how the UVC U-Lounge works: At select resorts in premier beach destinations in Mexico and the Dominican Republic, a Member Services Executive welcomes UVC members upon arrival and escorts them to the U-Lounge – a chic and relaxing, members-only area of the resort.\nOne of the newest enhancements to UVC membership, these elegantly appointed lounges provide a sumptuous respite after a day of travel. Members receive the ultimate VIP treatment here. All their vacation wishes are expertly handled quickly and easily, ensuring members have an unforgettable, worry-free stay.\nThe U-Lounge has no lines and no fuss. UVC members enjoy private VIP check-in. They also find out about special members-only promotions – for example, romantic dinners on the beach, wine and spa packages and more. Member Services Executives assist with reservations for yachting, diving, snorkeling and other excursions. They even arrange airport transfers and flight confirmations, so during their vacation, members don’t even need to think about their trip home.\nFor UVC members who want to stay in touch while away, U-Lounges provide complimentary Internet access. Members can also make international calls there to friends, family and colleagues back home at no additional charge.\nWith the U-Lounge and other UVC comforts, it’s no wonder many members also have their Member Services Executive make reservations for future vacations with UVC.\nTo date, each of the following UVC resorts has a U-Lounge: Secrets® Capri Riviera Cancun; Secrets® Maroma Beach Riviera Cancun; Secrets® Playa Mujeres Golf & Spa Resort; Breathless® Punta Cana Resort & Spa; Dreams® Huatulco Resort & Spa; Dreams® Tulum Resort & Spa; Now® Amber Puerto Vallarta; Now® Larimar Punta Cana; and Now® Sapphire Riviera Cancun.\nU-Lounges are coming soon to these UVC resorts as well: Secrets® Akumal Riviera Maya (opening November 2015); Secrets® Silversands Riviera Cancun; Dreams® Puerto Aventuras Resort & Spa; Dreams® Punta Cana Resort & Spa; Sunscape® Sabor Cozumel; and Sunscape® Dorado Pacifico Ixtapa.\nThe U-Lounge is just part of the luxurious services and amenities for UVC members.
