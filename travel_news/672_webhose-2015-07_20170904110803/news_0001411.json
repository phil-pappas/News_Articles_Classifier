He expected the negative trend to continue in July, local news agency Focus said. \nSome days ago, BNT reported that tour operators in the spa resort town of Sandanski in southern Bulgaria said that the number of Greek tourists coming to the town had dropped 50 per cent in recent months. \nOne tour operator said that the situation was in sharp contrast to five years ago, when in the streets of Sandanski, one heard more Greek than Bulgarian spoken.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T13:22:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
