The airline said that it would have a waiver available on its website for customers that are able to change their flight plans.\nIt is the second time in two months that the carrier has been hit by major technical issues.\nThe Chicago company had halted all takeoffs in the U.S. on June 2 due to what the airline described as computer automation issues.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration used the same language in its notice about the outage Wednesday.\nUnited suffered a series of computer problems in 2012 after switching to a passenger information computer system previously used by merger partner Continental Airlines.\nIn each case, hundreds of flights were delayed. A number of high-paying business travellers defected to other airlines and revenue dropped.\n\"We don't know everything behind this morning's issues yet, but today's incident underscores the sense that something is very wrong at United,\" said Gary Leff, co-founder of frequent-flier website MilePoint.\nShares of United Continental Holdings Inc. slid 2 per cent to $53.20 in morning trading.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T11:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T18:10:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
