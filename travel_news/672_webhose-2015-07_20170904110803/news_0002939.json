JOHN'S, N.L. -- The Royal St. John's Regatta, billed as the oldest organized sporting event in North America, will show off its new piece of infrastructure -- a three-storey timing, viewing and judging tower -- at this year's edition, set for Aug. 5. \nThe tower will serve as a focal point of the event, providing a platform for judges and dignitaries and allow for \"a world-class timing system\" for the annual rowing races on Quidi Vidi Lake, officials said. \nThe regatta, which dates back to 1818, draws more than 50,000 spectators each year and is a major summer tourism event in St. John's. It evolved from boat races involving St. John's residents and the crews of visiting ships early in the city's history, according to regatta lore. \nOrganizers are already preparing to mark the regatta's 200th anniversary in 2018. They plan to promote the celebration internationally with the help of more than $125,000 in federal funding announced this week.
