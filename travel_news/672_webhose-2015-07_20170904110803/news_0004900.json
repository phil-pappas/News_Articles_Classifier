Temperatures can vary significantly during the day, so it's important to dress in layers. In addition, the weather can change quickly in Alaska, so be prepared for rain and both hot and cold temperatures. When determining what to pack for your cruise, carefully consider the shore excursions you're planning on taking. Outdoor action-oriented excursions such as glacier hiking and sea kayaking require certain types of gear. It might be wise to bring along a waterproof bag for your camera as well. Plan to pack a carry-on bag containing your cruise and travel documents, passport, travel insurance information, credit cards, cash, medications, extra glasses, any valuables, your first night's dinner outfit, reading material, and anything else that is critical to enjoying the cruise. This way, your important items will stay with you in case your luggage is lost or delayed and you can enjoy your time after boarding the ship. Sometimes luggage can take hours to arrive in your stateroom. In addition, make 2-3 copies of your passport and important travel documents. Keep one or two of them with you separate from the originals in case your documents are stolen. Leave another at home with someone who could get them to you if necessary.
