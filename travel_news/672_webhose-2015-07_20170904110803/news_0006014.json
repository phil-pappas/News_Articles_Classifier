Not surprisingly, outdoor enthusiasts and converts wrote at length about the joys of nature, while opponents delivered fairly succinct condemnations of camping. Will these arguments change any minds? Read on. Good ol' days of camping I will forever stand on the side of loving what I call Real Camping: \nArriving at the campground in a 1955 Ford station wagon, Mom and Dad in the front seat, we three kids in the back, camping gear strapped on top. \nSleeping on the ground under the stars in a green or blue sleeping bag (with a plaid wool interior), with nothing but an air mattress underneath. Does this vacation scene look idyllic or horrific to you? (Anda Chu/Bay Area News Group archives) \nWaking to the smell of real bacon cooking on the Coleman stove. \nPlaying word games or board games to pass the time during the day. \nHiking the trails with park rangers, then gathering at the outdoor campfire at night to watch a Campfire Show. Our family all dressed in hooded gray sweatshirts, eating full-sized Sugar Daddies and singing camp songs. \nWatching the Firefall at Yosemite National Park. \nShopping at the camp's store for a souvenir felt banner to take home, thumb-tack to the bedroom wall and show everyone where we went on our summer vacation. Toni Lilley, Tracy He has his priorities Advertisement I hate camping! \"Roughing it\" to me is when the ice machine is not on my floor!! Wayne King, Los Altos But how do you really feel? Hate it!! Hate it!! Hate it!! HATE IT!! \nThe closest to roughing it that we did growing up was staying in Motel 6's and having those little cereal boxes for breakfast. When my first husband took me for my first camping trip, it was awful, and it just got worse each time we went. \nYears later, I took my son for a mother/son trip to Yosemite ... again, AWFUL. \nA three-star room with an ocean view is as rustic as I ever want to get. Karen Wendt, Mountain View Mom's now a real camping fan A layer of sweat, bug repellent and sunscreen cakes onto my skin like a wet fruit roll-up. My scalp is itchy, my feet are dusty and I smell like a campfire pit. Am I selling you yet on my family's favorite pastime? \nBefore kids, those symptoms were a deal-breaker. I did not like to camp. Then along came our little reproductions with boundless energy and endless curiosity. My husband, Vijay, and I brainstormed on vacation plans that would ensure we all had a good time. \"The Happiest Place on Earth\" practically comes with a happiness guarantee, right? Unfortunately, we found the long lines tiring, the rides too scary for our tots and that extra Disney magic too expensive. \nSo we decided to ditch commercial vacationing and give camping a spin. Instantly, we became fans of this vacation style. We loved how camping forced us to give up materialistic want for the simple bare-bones happiness of dirt, water, trees, mountains, sand and sky. The three words that drive every parent crazy -- \"I am bored\" -- are never uttered. \nCampsite activities my kids engage in are riding bikes, playing with sticks and pine cones, making nests, digging holes, studying rocks, exploring, collecting insects, climbing boulders, sketching, journaling and playing with a nearby stream of water for hours. They keep going until it gets dark, then we make a campfire and huddle close together for marshmallows and silly songs. \nMy kids are 9 and 6 now, and we have hiked up and down Vernal Falls several times already. A few months ago, we hiked the South Rim of the Grand Canyon and rode horses through Bryce Canyon in Utah. We purchased a national park membership pass for $80 and now can enter any park in the United States for free. So far, we've made use of it once a month. \nWe take in the Earth's beauty; we disconnect from media (we have a family rule to not play with electronics inside a national park), and we have good, simple fun. Fun that doesn't burst our budget. My husband and I are relaxing to the sounds of roaring waterfalls, bird cries and giggling children. \nAnd that sticky, itchy, stinky feeling that used to bother me so much before? I don't know what you're talking about. Regina Gadad, San Ramon A happy camping convert My first camping trip was not one of my more pleasant adventures. We slept in an old Boy Scout tent and listened to the skunks and raccoons foraging around the extinguished campfire for tidbits. Since that initial introduction 40-plus years ago, my husband, two sons and I have made it a ritual to camp several times each summer. The camping gear has been upgraded (to include a tent with a floor) along with all the necessities to prepare a casual or even gourmet meal. \nCamping allowed us to participate in the outdoors without interrupting the experience to return to a hotel at day's end. There were many great memories as a family. We appreciated the beauty of this country at Arches National Park, Yosemite, Big Sur, Anza Borrego Desert, Carlsbad Caverns, Crater Lake and Grand Canyon. \nWe also enjoyed the camping itself, whether at a small county campground or in one of the private campgrounds. Having early-morning coffee outside, hiking, swimming, visiting local sites, riding a bike without the worry of traffic, talking around the campfire -- it all culminated in an experience that provided the relaxation and enjoyment with family and friends that everyone seeks. \nYes, we still camp in a tent and friends wonder, \"Are you still enjoying that?\" I haven't gotten to the point where I can say it's time for an RV. Pam Miller, San Carlos Bugs, humidity, flooding -- enough! Camping is definitely not for me. I grew up in Texas, and between Girl Scout outings and summer camps, I had many opportunities to come to this conclusion. In fact, my childhood camping memories sometimes feel like something out of the movies. I never found the outdoors very peaceful. First, there are the creepy-crawlies, from ants to bees to cicadas. I'd either be fighting the wasps to get to my food or else running screaming in the other direction. One time, an area of camp was off-limits due to a large nest of rattlesnakes -- not something a 12-year-old girl wants to hear. \nThen there's the weather, which seemed to run in extremes. Camping in near-100-degree weather with over 90 percent humidity is certainly not my idea of fun. One summer it was so hot that my postage stamps melted to each other, and I couldn't even send my \"get me out of here\" letters home. If it wasn't heat, it was floods. Large thunderstorms could seemingly appear out of nowhere, making the ground so soggy that tent stakes wouldn't stay in place -- and it's hard to sleep when the tent walls are falling down on you. Lastly, don't even get me started on the poisonous plants. \nSo now when I'm asked whether I want to go camping, I shudder and politely decline. Although I will admit to one happy memory from camping: s'mores! Elizabeth Pavel, San Jose Not finding at least a Holiday Inn! Sally Peters, Menlo Park Be prepared, and you'll have fun Car camping means being able to carry more \"stuff\" in order to enjoy your camping experience. \nFirst, you need a good bed in order to enjoy sleeping in the tent. Comfy camping for my husband and me means a blow-up queen mattress that gets you off the hard, cold ground! And a decent sleeping bag so you won't freeze at night if the temps dip. I also bring a thick wool blanket to share just in case. \nWe also invested in a great tent that sleeps four, even though it is just the two of us. Why? More room to move around and a \"W Hotel experience\" where you can stand up to put on your clothing (instead of having to squirm into clothing while lying in a tiny hiking tent). \nDon't forget layers of clothing such as thermal undies, fleece, hat and gloves for the colder nights. \nOh yeah, plenty of hardwood for a blazing campfire adds to the festive camping atmosphere. We find free pallets and break them down weeks before the trip. \nBeing organized and having a good checklist of \"must-have\" items always makes the trip better.
