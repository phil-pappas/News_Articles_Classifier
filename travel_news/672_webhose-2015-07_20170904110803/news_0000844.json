There are others — most notably general manager Jeff Bridich and director of player development Zach Wilson — who believe Gray is simply not ready for his big-league debut.\nI'm on the record saying the husky right-hander from the University of Oklahoma, the third overall pick in the 2013 draft, should already be pitching in the big leagues. I figure he can handle, and learn from, the setbacks that will inevitably come his way. He doesn't have to be \"the savior,\" because there is nothing to save this season. So let him start his big-league tutelage.\nThen again, I have not seen Gray pitch, while the Rockies' brass has studied him intently. Gray was on a nice run for Triple-A Albuquerque until last Sunday, when he allowed four runs and six hits against the El Paso Chihuahuas. Gray needed 82 pitches (51 strikes) to get through just three innings.\nRELATED: Poor baserunning again costs Rockies in another loss to Padres\n\"The key for Jon is to see how he responds to that recent blip on his record,\" Wilson told The Denver Post last week. \"He has made tremendous progress this season, and you have to keep in mind that this is only his second full year in professional baseball.\"\nAdvertisement Gray is 4-6 with a 4.80 ERA, not bad considering he had a 10.80 ERA in four games (three starts) in April. He leads all pitchers in the Rockies' farm system with 90 strikeouts, while giving up 35 walks. He has made significant strides harnessing his lively fastball, and his secondary pitches have improved. High pitch counts, however, remain a concern.\nHere are the pros and cons of promoting Gray:\nPro: There are some competitors, and Gray might be one of them, who rise to a challenge and rise to the level of competition. Don't be afraid; show a little faith in him.\nCon: If Gray gets promoted, then gets lit up, he could lose his confidence and revert to bad habits.\nPro: The Rockies, firmly cemented in the National League West basement, need an infusion of talent and energy on the mound.\nCon: There is no need to put more pressure on Gray. Rushing him to the big leagues will do nothing to change the Rockies' lost season.\nPro: Moving up to the big-league club would enable Gray to get daily, hands-on mentoring from pitching coaches Steve Foster and Darren Holmes.\nCon: Many players say Triple-A pitching coach Darryl Scott is an excellent teacher and provides excellent support. Now is not the time to cut those ties.\nPro: At some point, the Rockies need to make a leap of faith with their top prospect. Now is as good a time as August or September.\nCon: There is no rush. Consider that right-hander Mark Appel, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2013 draft by the Houston Astros, has made just three starts in Triple-A and is much further away from his major-league debut than is Gray.\nPro: The Rockies could use a boost at the box office and need something to renew fan interest, which is lagging.\nCon: Gray represents the future of the franchise. It's short-sighted to bring him up too soon just to put fannies in the seats.\nPro: The Rockies' track record of developing starting pitchers is not good. Why not try a new approach and let Gray run with his natural talents?\nCon: Gray, despite his ability to throw a 100 mph fastball in college, was more of a raw thrower than an accomplished pitcher when the Rockies drafted him. He is, essentially, still in pitching school.\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T09:49:54.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
