Well, you're not alone.\nAs it turns out, human beings aren't so great at perceiving time, especially in short-term intervals, and we can be biased by other things going on around us.\nAll of this then leads to such a strange 'return trip effect,' in which the outward journey seems infinitely longer than the round trip - even if it's exactly the same.\nFor those who always feel like the return journey is shorter than the outbound trip, there's a scientific reason\nNew research published in the journal PLOS ONE has found evidence of this phenomenon, which you'll likely recognise as that feeling of your holiday ending far too quickly.\nWhen you visit an unfamiliar location and come back, the journey back appears to take less time, despite the fact that you've travelled the same distance.\nBut why is that the case?\n Cat's amazing!

The provocative images of 7/7 bombings and 9/11 it's hoped... Researchers in Japan attempted to answer this question by sitting people in a dim room to watch a 20-minute movie of a cameraman walking around a city.\nSubjects were then asked to report each time they believed three minutes had passed.\nIn total, participants watched two movies before being asked which they believed to be longer.\nOne group watched a round-trip - one video to one part of the city and one video back to the start - while the other took two one-way trips.\nA recent study found evidence of the 'return trip effect': the belief that when visiting an unfamiliar location, the return journey home takes less time\nWhile it may seem simple, the study was really looking at how we perceive time both as it's going along and what we think of time once a period has passed.\nAnd though both groups did an equal job of predicting how time was passing during the experiment, when they were asked to recall time passed afterwards, those who took a 'return trip' remembered the second part to be shorter.\nThose who took the two one-way trips, however, did not. Voila: the return trip effect.\nBut there may be a caveat to such a phenomenon - namely, you need to know that you're taking a return trip in order to feel like time is passing more quickly.\nJoseph Stromberg of Vox writes that the study suggests that the effect has something to do with hindsight and story-telling.\nAnd psychologists have attempted to explain the return trip effect in three different ways.\nOne such explanation attributes to the phenomenon to travellers paying more attention to time passing on the way to their destination, making time appear to move more slowly\nOne explanation is that on the initial trip, travellers pay more attention to time passing as they are eager to arrive, and since they are continually checking a watch or phone, time seems to move more slowly.\nOthers believe that the effect has to do with familiarity. On the way there, the route is often unclear, but on the way back, you recognise certain landmarks and sites, which makes it feel shorter.\nAnd contradicting all of this is the research that has found people can experience the effect even when they're in unfamiliar places.\nIn all likelihood, the phenomenon is likely a combination of these things and others.\nBut to help make your otherwise long-feeling outward journey seem shorter, remember the old adage: 'a watched pot never boils' and put down your watch and phone.", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1exT88d"], "published": "2015-07-06T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T18:18:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
