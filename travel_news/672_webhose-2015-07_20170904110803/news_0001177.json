Orchard Eggs, based in Chadwick End, supplies free-range eggs to Hogarths Stone Manor Hotel & Restaurant in Stone and says their hens will enter a short season next month which will see many lay the phenomenon that is the double-yolker, as often as every two days. \nThe season occurs every 13 months and this year’s will coincide with the hotel’s busiest period as it plays host to weddings, proms and tourists. Orchard Eggs owners Angela and Jon Cloke have more than 30 years’ traditional farming experience, providing a natural environment for hens which produces only the best quality eggs. The family-run business has been supplying eggs to Hogarths Stone Manor Hotel & Restaurant in Kidderminster for two years and demand has already seen more than a ten per cent increase each month since last year. Angela is particularly looking forward to the busy month that lays ahead. She said: “Everybody gets excited when they receive a double-yolker and as we enter our busiest season, we look forward to making guests’ mealtimes even tastier. “Our hens are given space to roam which allows them to express their natural behaviour and forage freely so the eggs are far healthier and tastier which makes meals even better. “Hogarths was one of our first clients when we set up the business and we are now delivering eggs to their second hotel in Kidderminster so we have developed a close working relationship with the team. “As the wedding season and summer holidays approach, we look forward to supporting Hogarths and exceeding our current record, which is 1,200 eggs a week!” Steven Quick, manager of Hogarths Stone Manor Hotel & Restaurant, is delighted with the quality of the eggs served to guests dining at the four-star venue. “Eggs are an essential ingredient within nearly all of our catering from weddings through to proms so it is important that we use only the best quality products – even better if it comes in the form of a double yolk!” he said. “Sourcing fine local produce is a top priority of ours and it is great knowing that the hens at Chadwick Farm are well looked after in a natural environment, especially as customers grow more and more mindful about the origins of the food and drink they consume.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T15:56:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
