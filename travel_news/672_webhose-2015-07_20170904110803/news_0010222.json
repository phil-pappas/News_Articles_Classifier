You’ve likely ridden a horse at some point, even if it was just a childhood pony ride on a leading rein. You may have done some schooling or pony trekking - or even tried your hand on a thoroughbred. But have you ever clambered aboard one of the outsized kings of the equine world – the “heavy horse”? These gentle giants have played a strong supporting role in British history, lugging cannon across First World War battlefields, hauling brewery carts along the nation’s streets and, back in the mists of time, galloping into battle weighed down by knights kitted out in heavy armour and brandishing swords and lances. Nowadays, though, Suffolk Punches, Shire horses and Clydesdale numbers are in steep decline. Genuine horsepower has been shoved aside by the fuel-driven version, and a horse that stands well over two metres high from tip to toe can’t measure up to the economy and usefulness of the motor vehicle. Most centres will allow children to ride from the age of five, so the whole family can saddle up The sheer size of these horses might be enough to give all but the most competent riders pause for thought. But pause not. These are not highly strung, twitchy types. Clydesdales, in particular, are calm but responsive. You only need to look at website comments to understand how much of an exhilarating experience this is. The amount of time you spend riding will define what you get out of your horseback high. With Cumbrian Heavy Horses , for example, you can be galloping along deserted beaches one day and cantering across the mountain tops of the western Lake District the next. Adventure Clydesdale will take you trekking - well, yomping – across Dartmoor, while you can opt for the rugged beauty of the Brecon Beacons or the calm loveliness of the Cambridgeshire countryside with Unicorn Trails . On a riding holiday you’ll feel the thrill of speeding along atop a wild creature, reconnect with the gorgeous countryside and burn a few calories, too. The balance and muscle movement required make riding a brilliant addition to your fitness regime. And if you have children, it can be the perfect opportunity for family fun. Most centres will allow children to ride from the age of five, so you can all saddle up and go all City Slickers , cantering across the fields singing the theme from Bonanza . Without all those messy cows.
