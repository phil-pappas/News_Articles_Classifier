The female humanoid on the left speaks in Japanese while the dinosaur on the right is for its English-speaking guests. Right after this peculiar encounter, an automatic trolley takes your luggage to your room. The hotel, located in Southwestern Japan, is ‘manned’ almost completely by robots in an effort to cut labor costs. Hideo Sawada, who runs the hotel, said the usage of robots is to utilize technology and achieve efficiency. One of the high-tech features of the hotel was the use of facial recognition technology. It allows the guests' face to be registered digitally when checking in. In case guests want their luggage carried to their room, an automated trolley helps them with their belongings. For storage purposes, a giant robotic arm places guests' items in boxes into the wall. The system is called a 'robot cloak room.' With all of the robots assigned to their specific duties around the hotel, the only real need for humans is for security. Security cameras, which are monitored by humans, make sure the guests are safe and that no one steals the expensive robots.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T13:45:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
