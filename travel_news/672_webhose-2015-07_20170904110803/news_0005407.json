The video was recorded because my girlfriend and I had to spend some time apart. \n'I hope everyone can give us some private space, let this go and don't pressurize my girlfriend and I.' \nYutian also posted on her account admitting that she was the naked woman in the video. \nHowever, since the messages were posted, both accounts have been deleted. \nThe location of the video was a little more obvious. \nAlthough the film didn't show where the changing room was, the telecom announcement in the background revealed that it was in the Uniqlo store. \nThe Sanlitun branch of Uniqlo has become an unlikely tourist attraction after people started taking selfies while standing outside the store. \nStaff have been encouraged to stop customers from doing this. However, it is currently proving difficult. \nTwo young entrepreneurs have even started selling t-shirts to commemorate the video. \nThe items were sold on Taobao, the Chinese equivalent of Ebay. \nThey were titled 'Beijing Sanlitun Uniqlo fitting room themed T-shirts: Make love in everywhere [sic]' and had obscene video screen grabs printed on them. \nThe t-shirts are now no longer available. \nSimilarly, the clip itself has also been deleted from all Chinese websites. \nWhen 'Uniqlo' is typed into the search bar of Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, a notice is shown, saying: 'According to law and regulation, the search result cannot be displayed.' \nThe Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the Chinese internet police, said that the video spread like a 'virus' on the internet and was 'a serious breach of socialist core values'. \nHowever, some Chinese Internet users accused the Japan-owned clothing store of using the stunt as lucrative marketing campaign. \nIn a statement on their website, Uniqlo strongly denied any claims of using the incident for advertising. \nThey have also asked customers to use the fitting room space properly and have introduced a new rule to the Beijing store which forbids more than one person in each fitting room at any one time. \nThe video is currently being investigated by Beijing police.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T11:08:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
