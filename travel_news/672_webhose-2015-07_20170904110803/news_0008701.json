It’s time to indulge your design dreams with a tour of an architect’s retreat. Today we’ll take a tour of Le Corbusier’s beach cabin in Cap Martin in the South of France. \nSwiss-born French architect Le Corbusier chose the French Riviera to build his own vacation getaway. Eschewing any kind of monumental structure, the visionary architect opted instead for the simplicity of a beach cabin. “Le Cabanon” is the materialisation of Le Corbusier’s concept of standardised housing units. He also applied the Modulor principles (the unit of measure invented by Le Corbusier) to calculate its scaled-down building dimensions: 3.66 by 3.66 metres and 2.26 metres high. \nThe furniture is minimalist to say the least and features a wooden bunk and two coffee tables, one of which doubles as a desk. There are also wooden cubes that serve as stools. The sparse decorating is offset by the colourfully painted floor and ceiling. The rustic charm of Le Corbusier’s vacation getaway. — AFP Relaxnews pic \nThe architect and his wife enjoyed spending their vacations in the beach cabin. Le Corbusier was found dead in the sea not far from there on August 27, 1965. \nToday, “Le Cabanon” has been annexed into the “Cap Moderne” estate, which also houses Irish architect and designer Eileen Gray’s E-1027 modernist villa, camping units designed by Le Corbusier, and bar and restaurant “L’Étoile de Mer” (“Starfish”) oncer patronised by the architect and his friends. \nTours of Le Corbusier’s beach cabin have resumed since “Cap Moderne” reopened in June. It should be noted that all tours must be scheduled ahead of time and are limited to no more than four visitors for a total of three minutes. The strict rules are meant to preserve the fragile construction. — AFP Relaxnews \nFor more information: www.capmoderne.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T04:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T09:33:13.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
