ADVERTISEMENT \nCarnival Corporation is in active discussions and plans to work with the appropriate authorities in Cuba so that Cuban approval is granted. \n“We are excited about receiving US approval as the very important first step to ultimately take travellers to Cuba under the existing 12 criteria for authorised travel. \n“We look forward to working with the Cuban authorities for their approval to help make the social, cultural and humanitarian exchanges between US citizens and the people of Cuba a reality,” said Arnold Donald, president of Carnival Corporation. \n“We know there is strong demand from travellers who want to immerse themselves in Cuban culture, so this is a historic opportunity for us to enable more people to experience Cuban society.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T15:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T17:05:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
