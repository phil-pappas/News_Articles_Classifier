City in flux\nIt's a city in flux, where formal Islamic culture -- many women are veiled, and alcohol is prohibited -- exists alongside a mishmash of chaotic street market commerce and more modern glass-fronted office buildings, trendy cafes and air-conditioned gyms.\nAnd what this young city lacks in striking historical architecture it makes up for in ambiance and a sense of exploration.\nThe central market below the main thoroughfare of Independence Road contains a warren of tight lanes hiding everything from perfume, clothes and electronic goods to tinned foods, fruits, vegetables and pyramids of dazzlingly colored spices.\nTurn one corner and your nose first lets you know about the tight walkway flanked on both sides by tables covered in mounds of fresh red meat among which women squat and swish away flies.\nOn the southeastern outskirts is the open-air livestock market, where every day hundreds of camels, goats and sheep are traded.\nBehind frothing male camels squaring off to each other, silhouetted in the distance are two adjacent triangular mountains, the so-called breasts of Sheba.\nFish fans are well catered for with Somaliland's 850 kilometers of coastline providing ample stock to Hargeisa's restaurants.\nA generous portion of fish steak and rice goes for about $3 -- best enjoyed with the spicy red powder locals like to have with it.\nBack from the brink\nThen there's the deliciously sweet milky Somali tea brewed in great vats at what seems like every street corner.\nWith a piping-hot glass costing a mere 1,000 Somaliland shillings ($1=7,000 Somaliland shillings), a liking for this beverage can easily develop into a new addiction.\nIn Hargeisa it's not just the tea that's hot.\nAfter lunch, at around 1.30 p.m., streets empty as people retreat from the heat for an afternoon siesta.\nCome 4:30 p.m. the city wakes up, the streets fill and the volume from traffic and chattering, haggling voices continues to rise.\nHargeisa might be the capital of a country that technically doesn't exist, but after a civil war in the 1980s the city barely existed in reality.\n\"It was totally destroyed -- there was just rubble, waste,\" says Saeed Mohamoud who works with Horizon Institute, a local organization helping communities transition from underdevelopment to resilience and stability.\nOn the walls of the Oriental -- built in 1953, it's Hargeisa's oldest hotel -- are photos of the building, bullet-ridden and half demolished during the civil war.\nBut next to these are also new posters depicting Somaliland's beaches and historic sites under the hopeful banner: \"Wonderful Somaliland -- The Newest Tourist Destination in Africa.\"\nToyota importers for Somaliland at the Hargeisa International Trade Fair. Remarkably safe\nMuch of the construction in Hargeisa has been funded by the Somaliland diaspora, pitching in as Somaliland has had to go it alone.\nThis can-do attitude against the odds gives the city and its inhabitants much of their animated charm; and explains why locals are so pleased to meet unexpected foreign visitors.\n\"The people are extremely welcoming, with a vibrancy and optimism about the state functioning well enough to allow people do their business,\" Rowlatt said.b\nSomalilanders are not shy -- walking down Hargeisa's streets visitors will likely encounter numerous questions about where they are from.\nQueries are often followed by friendly entreaties not to forget that they are in the one and only Somaliland, and to tell others about it.\nHargeisa is remarkably safe for foreigners, in spite of all the negative associations with Somalia.\nVisitors can sit at ease beside a busy street drinking a cup of Somali tea.\nThat's not to say there aren't problems.\nWith the international community refusing to recognize Somaliland's independence, its economy remains cut off from large-scale international assistance and global financial systems.\nPoverty is widespread and swathes of young men lounging on Hargeisa's streets testify to chronic unemployment rates of up to 75%.\nMeanwhile, concerns are being voiced about stricter Islamic customs increasingly influencing society.\nFor now, though, tourists taking their government's travel advisories with a pinch of salt can visit Hargeisa in relative safety.\nThe city also serves as a good base from where to take in Somaliland's other attractions, including some of the world's oldest rock art, found in the Las Geel caves 50 kilometers from the city.\nBy the end of a trip to Hargeisa, the visitor is left in little doubt: this is a city determined to stake its claim on the world map.", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714190020-somaliland-new-12-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714165120-somaliland-new-1-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714165120-somaliland-new-1-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714190020-somaliland-new-12-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714190020-somaliland-new-12-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/07/15/somaliland_map_300x590.png)", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714165120-somaliland-new-1-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714190020-somaliland-new-12-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714190020-somaliland-new-12-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/07/15/somaliland_map_1100x620.png);", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714165120-somaliland-new-1-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714190020-somaliland-new-12-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714165120-somaliland-new-1-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/07/15/somaliland_map_1100x620.png)", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/07/15/somaliland_map_780x440.png);", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714165120-somaliland-new-1-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714190020-somaliland-new-12-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150714165120-somaliland-new-1-super-169.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-15T07:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T11:22:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
