At 7:49 a.m. ET Tuesday , it will make its closest approach to Pluto. How engineers are able to transmit photos and datasets from such cold and remote locations will be among topics of discussion at the IEEE International Conference on Wireless for Space and Extreme Environments (WiSEE) in Orlando, Fla. , 14-16 December. http://sites.ieee.org/wisee/ The event is designed to help attendees understand and solve emerging problems facing wireless sensing and communication during spaceflight and in extreme environments such as planetary surfaces, space vehicles and space habitats. It will bring together investigators from NASA, the European Space Agency, Canadian Space Agency and academia, as well as space defense and aerospace industries. WiSEE, at the University of Central Florida Fairwinds Alumni Center, includes four co-located workshops: * Space Solar Power* Passive Wireless Sensor Technology* Space-Terrestrial Internetworking* Wireless Sensor Systems The conference will also feature a 16 December tour of the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla. BACKGROUND The many challenges faced in space sensing and communication are extremely diverse and overlap significantly with those found in extreme environments on earth. These environments pose significant challenges for radio frequency and optical wireless sensing and communication and will require the application of a broad range of technologies to generate reliable and cost-effective solutions. Although specific challenges vary significantly from one environment to another, many of the solutions offered by sensing, communication and statistical signal processing technologies can be applied in multiple environments. CALL for PAPERS WiSEE organizers are seeking papers and posters by 1 September that address solutions to challenges in the following areas: 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T22:56:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
