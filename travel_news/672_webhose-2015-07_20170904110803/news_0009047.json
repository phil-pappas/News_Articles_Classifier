Ultimately your client gets a unique level of service they wouldn’t get from another TMC.” \nHughes also revealed future enhancements to the company’s groups department, including dedicated branding and marketing for this area of the business, and offering agents further ability to package group bookings under the company’s in-house packaging system.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T19:22:32.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
