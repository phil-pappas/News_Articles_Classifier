Marriott. \nApproaching and entering the Vinoy in the seaside enclave of St. Petersburg can evoke several time periods at once—including going to grandmother’s house. That is, if your grandmother lives in a pink, 361-room Italianate mansion on Tampa Bay with a speakeasy downstairs and a modern spa attached to it—and an 18-hole championship golf course just a few blocks away. \nFirst opened in 1925, the resort soon became the social hub of St. Petersburg. Today the 4-star Vinoy is a member of the Historic Hotels of America and on the National Register of Historic Places. \nWhile the Vinoy certainly is not a wedding mill, guests may encounter several wedding parties on any given weekend. Are those two brides over there? Perhaps they’re getting married to each other; the Vinoy is also hospitable to same-gender couples that wish to be married at the famed resort. Guest Accommodations \nOpt for a suite with romantic views of the marina and Tampa Bay beyond. Rooms and suites are decorated in soothing natural tones with splashes of red thrown in for zest. \nWalls are adorned with art that features seascapes in case you’d rather languish in the pillow-top bed rather than plunge into the sea itself. Marble-covered baths with tubs and showers enhance the luxurious appointments. \nFlat-screen TVs, wi-fi (at an additional cost), coffeemakers, irons (for last-minute touchups) and minibars are in all rooms. Some also feature balconies or patios, providing refreshing whiffs of seaside air. Dining at Vinoy \nA gracious veranda runs along the front of the hotel and contains the Veranda Café, which serves freshly baked goods (the scones are worth the trip alone), beverages, both alcoholic and non, sandwiches and healthy smoothies. Do sit on the fun, relaxing veranda at least once during your stay to sip a cocktail and engage in a little people watching. \nFor a trip back into the 1920s, visit Fred’s Cellar, which offers aged prime steaks and bracing craft cocktails. \nGuests and locals throng to Marchand’s Bar and Grill, the resort’s main dining room. Its soaring ceiling and Egyptian Deco décor is a sumptuous setting for the Vinoy’s famed brunches, sit-down lunches and memorable romantic dinners. \nAdditional casual dining options include Alfresco’s—serving the juiciest of burgers, wraps and sandwiches (local grouper , anyone?) and the lobby bar. Destination Weddings & Honeymoons at Vinoy \nNo two weddings are alike at the hotel. Begin wedding planning by contacting the in-house romance team to learn about the possibilities. The property can accommodate weddings and receptions of several hundred guests in the Vinoy’s grand ballroom to smaller affairs to simple elopements. \nShould you wish to spend your honeymoon at the Vinoy in addition to the wedding, the romance team can present options to help trim dollars off the bottom line. \nLeading up to the event, some brides rent a suite to serve as ‘bridal-central’. After the ceremony and reception, the same suite can be transformed into honeymoon central. Activities at Vinoy \nThe Vinoy Golf Club is one of the best in the area and is reserved for hotel guests and members. The famed 18-hole course (greens fees apply), clubhouse and restaurant are one of the main attractions at the resort. The Vinoy Salon and Day Spa, a full-service fitness center and two pools round out the activities offerings. Visiting St. Petersburg from Vinoy \nSt. Petersburg was originally conceived to be a seaside getaway. It did go through a ‘sleepy’ period—some would say it nodded off completely. \nThe nap is over: St. Petersburg is a vibrant city that within easy strolling distance of the Vinow, one can take in the Chihuly Collection (glass, glass, glass) and the truly spectacular Salvador Dali Museum . \nAlso nearby is a unique farmers market: designer chicken coops, anyone? They have them here in addition to fresh locally grown produce. \nThe Vinoy’s concierge can also help to arrange a boat ride from the marina that takes couples on a fishing expedition or a romantic sunset cruise on Tampa Bay. Vibe at Vinoy \nThe resort is the social hub of St. Petersburg and can get busy, especially during weekends. The Vinoy is also very family-friendly; if well-behaved kids bother you, then perhaps the hotel’s staff can guide you to a kid-free zone… Other than that, the famed resort can be a memorable, one-of-a-kind place to marry and honeymoon. \nAn all-purpose hotel, the Vinoy hosts wedding parties, families arriving on vacation, an occasional business group, thirsty foursomes returning from a day on the links and couples out on the town. \nIf all this gets a little hectic, just relax on the veranda and view the whole show through rose-colored glasses while sipping a sweet iced tea or a frosty mint julep.
