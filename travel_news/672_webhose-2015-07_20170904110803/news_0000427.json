Starting last Wednesday, rank and file Southwest flight attendants got their first look at the complex tentative contract, which sources said runs a mind-boggling 219 pages. The proposed contract was negotiated over a two-year period by a 17-member executive committee of Transport Workers Union Local 556, which represents some 13,500 unionized Southwest flight attendants, including more than 1,800 domiciled in Chicago. The executive committee voted 12 to 5 in favor of presenting the tentative contract to rank and file for ratification. In recent days, as the tentative contract was distributed to flight attendants, so-called educators handpicked by Local 556's executive board have fanned out to airport crew lounges and hotel meeting rooms throughout the Southwest Airlines network to \"sell\" the proposed contract's merits. But educators notwithstanding, it was apparent as soon as thousands of Southwest flight attendants began to get a good look at the fine print in the contract that more than a few union members were not happy. In one of many heartfelt and lengthy letters received by this reporter in recent days, a Southwest flight attendant who has worked for the airline for well over a decade, called the proposal some are labeling a \"great contract\" in fact \"nothing shy of a slap in the face to the hardest working flight attendants of Southwest Airlines.\" The flight attendant added: \"Our new hires will be subjected to some of the very worst work rules I have ever seen. Our most senior flight attendants, you remember, the ones who paved the way and built this empire, have received absolutely nothing beneficial for their years of service.\" This flight attendant also cleverly employed a key line from an ad campaign Southwest launched last fall when it unveiled a major rebranding effort. The ad copy line is \"without a heart, it's just a machine,\" referring to Southwest's fleet of planes, which are getting a new livery. But in the email, the flight attendant emphasized \"we are not machines!\" It's impossible even for insiders to know exactly how deep the rift over the proposed new work contract actually is. Local 556 executive board members and others working to get the proposed contract ratified suggest the badmouthing might be coming from a relatively small but vocal group who are upset with union and airline management — a group possibly not reflective of the majority rank and file. But those advocating on behalf of the new contract aren't certain either just how the vote might go. And in the many informational meetings that have taken place in recent days, many flight attendants reportedly are keeping their key thoughts about the proposed deal to themselves until they vote. One person who is on the front lines explaining the tentative contract to Southwest flight attendants is labor lawyer Mark Richard , who worked for Local 556 to get the proposed contract. Richard's extensive experience as a labor lawyer includes work with many other airline labor unions, and, somewhat surprisingly, with the Chicago Teacher's Union, which famously went on strike in 2012. So Richard is well aware of what labor unrest is all about — especially as it has been on view in Chicago. Late last week, Southwest flight attendants also found out that rank and file pilots at Delta Air Lines had in fact just voted down a proposed contract presented to them. According to multiple news reports, the proposed contract offered higher pay, but cut the Delta pilots' take in profit-sharing and involved other work rule changes the pilots didn't like. Record profits being reported by Southwest and Delta and other airlines are in part fueling the hard line unions are taking in negotiating new contracts. In fact, sources said today that Southwest flight attendants are being urged by their fellow rank and file to wait until the last couple of days of the voting window to cast their votes because Southwest Airlines late next week is expected to unveil its second-quarter financial report, which might reveal more record profits. The final day for Local 556 members to vote on the proposed contract is believed to be Friday, July 24. Make no mistake. Many Southwest flight attendants see money and onerous new work rules to be key factors as they weigh how they will vote on the proposed contract. Said one flight attendant: \"In order to maintain our billion dollar company, make us happy, and we WILL (sic) do the work.\" \nWant Chicago Travel news in your inbox?
