They said they were instructed not to change money,” he said, adding that he had also experienced card payments becoming less widely accepted, though cash machines were still working.\n“In all my years of travelling I have never come across anyone refusing the English pound. It was a strange sensation,” he added.\nHis partner, Janet Taylor, from Mossley in Greater Manchester, said the couple had flown to Athens before four weeks of island-hopping. “Some people report no problem with cards, some have had them refused,” she said. “Some ATMs are working. some empty. In reality the picture is mixed.\n“I have been travelling around the Little Cyclades so I am not sure if things are different on the larger islands.”\nSeabury said the island’s residents did not appear to be unduly worried about the crisis: “They shrug their shoulders, smile and give a resigned, pained look.” But after having few problems for the past month, he said he had not been able to change any money when he arrived in Naxos.\nSeveral tourists said on social media they had been advised to use small denomination notes to help locals who may have difficulties giving change. But others noted that ATMs in the capital were dispensing just €50 notes, not €20s, meaning locals are unable to take out their full €60 daily allowance.\n— Eleni Giokos (@EleniGiokos) July 2, 2015 Seems some ATMs in Greece have run out of 10 & 20 euro notes and dispensing 50's - another unforeseen cut to the 60 euro daily limit #Greece\n— Lanky Lamb (@lankylamb) July 6, 2015 Greece cash machines reported to only have 50 Euro notes although citizens can withdraw 60. What are they going to do if they reduce to 20?\nIn the capital, tourists reported few difficulties , apart from signs declaring all travel on the Athens Metro would be free until further notice.\nHotels, cafes and restaurants are still accepting credit card payments, with only a few queues outside cashpoints. Daily withdrawal limits imposed on Greeks do not apply to tourists.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Irene and Wayne Lovatt, from Pontypridd, brought plenty of cash to Naxos Photograph: Wesley Johnson/PA Wayne Lovatt, from Pontypridd, Mid Glamorgan, holidaying for a fortnight with his wife, Irene, said he had come prepared. “We knew about the problems and we brought enough [cash] out here. Before, we’ve always paid by credit card but outside the cities you can’t.”\nLocals appreciate cash payments his wife added: “They’ve got to pay their staff and keep everything going.”\nBut the advice to carry cash for the duration of the holidays has increased fears that tourists may be targets for mugging.\nTravel industry body Abta said tourists should take appropriate security precautions against theft such as using their hotel safe or splitting cash up between their party.\nSunvil holidays, a Greece-speciality travel firm, said it had amended its insurance policy to increase the cover for personal cash to £500 per person for those travelling in July. The firm, which sends about 20,000 holidaymakers to Greece every summer, said it would have cash available at local offices , as did fellow travel firms Olympic Holidays and Ionian Holidays.\nRelated: How the Greek financial crisis could affect your holiday plans\nThe Greek government has been keen to assure tourists that any reports of food or fuel shortages, or price rises will not affect them.\nEconomy minister, George Stathakis, said last week: “Hotels, restaurants, shops and supermarkets have adequate food supplies, the prices of which have remained stable if not reduced as in the case of fresh fruit and vegetables [and] this is also the case for fuel, as gas stations are adequately stocked and prices remain unchanged.\n“Any reports stating the opposite are not reflecting the actual situation on the ground,” the statement continued, adding that the government would ensure “demand is entirely covered not only for the Greek people but also for the numerous visitors who have chosen Greece for their holidays.”", "external_links": ["http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Tourists+in+Greece+report+problems+changing+cash&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2015%2Fjul%2F12%2Ftourists-in-greece-report-problems-changing-cash&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F0673b3d84e226f6335a6e7761c015c1f7ed963c0%2F89_48_3508_2104%2F3508.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4at5g%2Fsfb%23img-2&ref=responsive", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Tourists+in+Greece+report+problems+changing+cash&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4at5g%2Fstw%23img-2", "https://twitter.com/lankylamb/status/618000028716662784", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/EleniGiokos/status/616681443117371392", "https://twitter.com/lankylamb/statuses/618000028716662784", "https://twitter.com/EleniGiokos/statuses/616681443117371392"], "published": "2015-07-12T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T15:32:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
