Technology levels the playing field.”\nDespite being one of the first women to reach the top of this notoriously male-dominated landscape, that’s typical of Ms Kurtzig’s no-nonsense attitude to life and business.\nAfter gaining a degree in maths from the University of California Los Angeles and a masters in aeronautical engineering from Stanford, she worked selling timeshares for General Electric before leaving to spend more time with her family.\nIf it doesn’t sound like a classically feminist move, that’s because it wasn’t. Ms Kurtzig marches to the beat of her own drum, a beat with such force and momentum that it wasn’t long before she took up a small side project that blossomed into a $400 million business.\nIn 1972, the mother of two started ASK Computer Systems with $US2000 of her savings working part-time from her second bedroom.\nAt the time, “people thought software was women’s underwear”, she said.\nBut Ms Kurtzig had already recognised it would overtake hardware in the market — and those early programs she created for the manufacturing industry are still used today.\nDid she want to climb the corporate ladder? “No, I wanted a family.”\nSandra Kurtzig. Source: Supplied\nBut her drive and her enthusiasm for a challenge meant her company quickly snowballed into something far bigger than anything she could have imagined. There were hard times. The company was down to its last payroll at one point and she “started over three times”, but ASK turned out to be one of the largest software companies in the world.\nIn 1981, Ms Kurtzig became the first woman to take a tech company public — which was “very nice”, she conceded.\nHer self-funded success is now an unusual story in the tech sector, where money is flowing, growth is lightning-fast and venture capitalists are seen as an essential. Yet some things don’t change.\nMs Kurtzig resigned as CEO of ASK in 1985, to spend more time with her husband and sons, but was lured back a few years later when she turned it into the largest public company ever founded and run by a woman.\nThe mother of two sees “a real advantage for women to combine career and family” because she needed more than “baby talk” to fill her days.\nShe admits the balance was always difficult, especially when she was working 18-hour days, but “if you don’t have things to do, you tend to fill the time with things that are not as important.”\nHer work later provided a bond with her sons Ken and Andy. When your children go to college, you “lose some connection”, she said, but she was able to play a part in her children’s success, at one time helping them run the firm E-Benefits.\nShe retired again in 1992, retaining an involvement in education and the entrepreneurial world, but focusing on family, writing her autobiography CEO: Building a $400 million Company from the Ground Up and overseeing the construction of her dream home in Hawaii.\nWorking with contractors on a physical construction was no different to interacting with developers on building software, from her point of view.\nBut she still hadn’t had enough of Silicon Valley. After a conversation in Hawaii with Marc Benioff from Salesforce about the cloud and “this whole new way of engaging with the world”, she saw a huge opportunity.\nSandra Kurtzig. Source: Supplied\nBy 2010, already in her 60s and with the tech landscape undergoing a radical transformation, she returned with a new company named Kenandy (after her sons) and a fresh concept.\nThis time, everyone knew who she was and the investors were queuing up: a new source of pressure, as well as opportunity for Ms Kurtzig.\nShe wasn’t afraid.\nWhile she acknowledges feminine characteristics in her management style, which is empathetic and emotionally connected, she is fiercely competitive.\nShe isn’t afraid to make mistakes or to take risks.\n“That’s what entrepreneurship is all about. It’s not mistakes that are the issue, it’s not learning from them.”\nThe world had changed. Information was more easily available and everything moved at lightning speed. But in just five years, Ms Kurtzig’s cloud-based enterprise management software has more than 100 employees and is another success story.\n“You have to believe in yourself. If you can’t believe in yourself, how can you expect somebody else to?\nOriginally published as How to make $400m in 10 years", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/26/1227457/581132-294f2642-319d-11e5-9ab0-19db9af17447.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/queen-of-silicon-valley-sandra-kurtzig-on-success-of-ask-computers/story-fnjwubd2-1227457572461", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/26/1227457/579702-2a3dd292-319d-11e5-9ab0-19db9af17447.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-27T02:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T15:31:48.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
