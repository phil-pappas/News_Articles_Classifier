In the most recent attack, on Wednesday, authorities said the victim was swimming in front of a lifeguard stand when a gray shark, as large as seven feet long, pulled him under the water and bit him on the rib cage, hip, lower leg and both hands. Earlier victims included a 17-year-old near Waves , N.C.; an 8-year-old swimming in knee-deep water in Surf City ; and two young swimmers bitten by sharks in waters off Oak Island on the same day who each had an arm amputated.

Pat McCrory said Thursday officials were trying to find a way to keep the key tourism region safe for visitors, the Associated Press reported. “We’re still looking for a pattern,” he said. “I am going to be talking to my secretary of public safety to see if there is any one-fit-all approach to dealing with this issue. I doubt there is because each circumstance is so different.” As much of the country heads to be beach for the long July 4 weekend, swimmers could be forgiven for peering into murky water for a fleeting shadow or a fin jutting out of the depths. But should they worry? Photo Bystanders and emergency personnel assisted a teenage girl at the scene of a shark attack last month in Oak Island, N.C. Credit Steve Bouser/The Pilot, via Associated Press “The ‘summer of the shark’ tends to be media driven,” said Gregory Skomal, a senior marine fisheries scientist in Massachusetts. “Once people get sharks on the brain, these attacks will do that. People start to see them everywhere.” Noting that 2015 marks the 40th anniversary of the classic shark movie “Jaws,” Mr. Skomal said perceptions of danger are fueled by the proliferation of social media, cellphone cameras and GoPro devices, such as one used to record a great white shark off Jones Beach, on Long Island, in June. Scientists rely on long-term data to determine if the beaches are more dangerous this year than in previous years. But swimmers — and parents — don’t have that luxury. Even Mr. Skomal admits the frequency of reported shark bites in North Carolina has been “unusual.” So, our guide to the “summer of the shark:” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Where are the sharks? At this time of year, sharks migrate north from Florida, following warm water, and it is not unusual for them to show up in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, where most of the attacks have taken place. Sharks go where the food is, and scientists have recently noticed highly productive populations of herring in North Carolina, coinciding with the summer nesting season for sea turtles. “They will eat sea turtles like potato chips,” said George H. Burgess, director of the Florida Program for Shark Research. In addition, sharks give birth in coastal areas, and juveniles tend to stay near the shore for the summer where the feeding is easier. The balance of prey and predator has changed farther up the East Coast, on Cape Cod, Mass., as well. Seal colonies flourished there after the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act, attracting more great white sharks. In the past six years, 56 great whites have been tagged, said Mr. Skomal. “The cafe is open and the customers have figured it out,” he said. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T23:52:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
