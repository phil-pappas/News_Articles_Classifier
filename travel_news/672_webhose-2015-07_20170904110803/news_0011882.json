Raised in Jaffray, B.C., Brody had at the time taken up residence in Nashville and it was his first time back on familiar soil in a couple of years. \nHe decided to rent a rugged SUV and ferry himself from venue to venue, city to city. \n\"It was almost a vacation for me,\" recalled the Juno winner recently. \"Things had been such a rat race and such a crazy chaotic time with my first record coming out and (being in) the U.S. market. \n\"Going across Canada and having that time to think and seeing grain elevators and landmarks in Canada -- I remember actually at one point taking a side road and getting a little emotional because I hadn't been on a dirt road in over a year. \n\"I found a lot of perspective on that drive across Canada.\" \nOn Sept. 24, Brody and seven-time Juno winner Paul Brandt will together set off on the cross-Canada Road Trip tour. Ahead of Canada Day, the two stars of country listed some of their favourite places in the country. \nTHE WEST \nBrandt ran his first marathon in Kelowna, B.C., and his second in Vancouver, where he savoured trotting along the \"amazing\" seawall. \n\"It's one of the most beautiful parts of the world,\" he said enthusiastically. \nAnd Brody recommends flying into Calgary and driving down Hwy. 22 before cruising into B.C. from the southeast. \n\"It's this really dramatic change in landscape,\" he said, noting that the film Legends of the Fall was shot in the area. \"It's just really beautiful.\" \nHALIFAX \nIf you dine at the Five Fishermen in this well-loved Nova Scotia city, tell them Paul Brandt sent you. \n\"I'm a sucker for the mussel bar there,\" he said, chuckling. \n\"I know that's not high cuisine or anything like that, but I make jokes with the band guys all the time: The next time I go there I'm going to wear parachute pants with deep pockets to smuggle mussels out.\" \nHe also loves jogging around Citadel Hill and \"getting a feel for the history of the city and, really, our nation.\" \nBrody, who lives an hour's drive from Halifax in Chester, of course agrees about the abundant charm of the city -- and it's where their tour will end, on Oct. 24. \n\"Halifax in the summertime is amazing,\" he raved. \"The waterfront is great. Lots of artists on the boardwalk, great restaurants and 200-year-old pubs.\" \nONTARIO \nBrandt cherishes jogging along Ottawa's picturesque Rideau Canal and absorbing a horizon of historic sites. \n\"Maybe once or twice I've stopped in Byward Market and got a pastry or two along the way,\" he confided. \nBrody, meanwhile, didn't visit Toronto for the first time until coming to town to shoot the video for Brothers in 2009. \nHe ranks Toronto among his four favourite cities, along with New York, London and Auckland, New Zealand. \n\"There's so much diversity and Yonge-Dundas, that big square? I love that, man,\" he said. \n\"I love that area. I've stayed there a few times at the Pantages Hotel and that square is one of my favourite spots in the world to hang out. It's a really cool vibe.\" \nNUNAVUT \nBrandt distinguishes Iqaluit as his favourite place he's ever travelled. \nPerforming at the opening ceremony of 2002's Arctic Winter Games, Brandt was simply awed by what he found. \n\"It was one of the richest cultural experiences I've had in all my world travels,\" he said. \n\"To see the resiliency, the passion of the people who live there -- it was very eye-opening and an experience I'll never forget.\" Reader's comments Â» \nBy adding a comment on the site, you accept our terms and conditions and our netiquette rules .
