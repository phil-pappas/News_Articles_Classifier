(AP Photo/Butch Dill) That part wasn’t surprising. After all, Spurrier holds the record with 23 appearances at SEC Media Days between his time as the head coach at Florida and South Carolina.\nBut the next part of his statement was ironic.\n“I figured a bunch of you guys would have retired by now.”\nIt was met with laughter, as many of the reporters were preparing to ask the 70-year-old coach about his own retirement timeline. But, as he’s often been during his career, Spurrier was one step ahead.\nWhen he was asked about his future, Spurrier was clear that he doesn’t have plans to step away from coaching any time soon.\n“I breezed right through age 60, breezed right through 65, and I’m going to try my best to breeze right on through 70,” Spurrier said. “Age doesn’t really mean a lot. It’s about whether you can function physically, emotionally, mentally, and get your team ready to play.”\nAfter 12 highly successful seasons as the Gators’ head coach, Spurrier is preparing for his 11th season with the Gamecocks. He’s compiled an 84-45 record in Columbia and made the Gamecocks relevant again.\nBut Spurrier admitted last season was tough on him, as the Gamecocks finished with a 7-6 record following three consecutive 11-2 seasons. Beating Miami in last year’s Duck Commander Independence Bowl to cap off the season “rejuvenated” the team, though.\n“Somebody told me the other day that I’m the youngest coach in the SEC who has won four straight bowl games,” Spurrier said with a laugh. “Did you know that? I’m the youngest coach to have done that right now.”\nWhile Spurrier drew a lot of laughs during his press conference, he also addressed some serious off-the-field issues.\nSpurrier applauded South Carolina governor Nikki Haley for her role in the permanent removal of the Confederate battle flag from the State Capitol grounds. He also spoke about his rule regarding domestic violence, which has been a popular topic with Florida State quarterback De’Andre Johnson and current Seminoles running back Dalvin Cook facing battery charges for allegedly hitting women recently.\n“I’ve always had a rule as a coach,” Spurrier said. “If you ever hit a girl, you’re finished. We enforce that rule.”\nAs always, Spurrier kept his SEC Media Days address interesting. And it doesn’t look like it’s going to be his final one either.\n“That retirement thing, I don’t think I would be very good at it,” he said. “I can go to the beach and stay four or five days. But after that, I want to get out of there. That’s long enough.”\nBut Spurrier doesn’t feel the same way about coaching. After more than 20 years as a college football head coach, it still isn’t long enough for him to step away.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/07/14/e1/6d/SEC-Media-Days-Football-2-.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-15T00:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T00:01:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
