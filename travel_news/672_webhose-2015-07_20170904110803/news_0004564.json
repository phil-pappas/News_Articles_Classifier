The 29-year-old Londoner, who was born without a right hand, was one of the first women in the UK to receive the world’s most life-like bionic limb. The brains behind this medical miracle, which relies on Formula 1 technology, is a company based in Leeds called Steeper. “We’ve been manufacturing hands that are electronically operated for the past 30 years. However, these are simple devices that have only a pinch-type grip and can really only open and close. But about five years ago we developed a more sophisticated hand where all the fingers can move individually as well as the thumb,” says Paul Steeper, the firm’s managing director.

It is built around an accurate skeletal structure with miniaturised components designed to simulate natural movements. Weighing around 390g, the hand measures 165mm from base to middle fingertip - the size of an average woman’s hand – and contains 337 mechanical parts. It is strong enough to handle up to 45kg – around the same as 25 bricks - and has 14 grip patterns and hand positions to allow a range of precision movements. Ashwell was the first UK patient to receive the latest model of the bebionic hand. A 10-year-old girl from Los Angeles was also fitted with one around the same time. The company had developed two previous versions, although these were aimed at men and larger patients. Until recently, the firm had struggled to create an artificial hand suitable for women and adolescents able to hold the five motors needed to operate like a functional hand. “The movements now come easily and look natural – I keep finding myself being surprised by the little things, like being able to carry my purse while holding my boyfriend’s hand. I’ve also been able to do things never before possible like riding a bike and lifting weights,” Ashwell said. Steeper’s products, which also include other artificial limbs, specialist footwear and braces, are all made in Leeds. Around 150 people are involved in the making of the individual components needed for a bionic limb. The company as a whole employs 470, with some based in San Antonio, Texas, to cater for the US market. Steeper makes all of its products in Leeds Steeper has contracts with the NHS in the UK and the company supplies a number of other healthcare providers across the world. In total, it has a network of 24 distributors across the world and reports strong sales in the US and, increasingly, the Middle East. However, its bionic arms aren’t available to everyone on the NHS because of the cost. Bought privately, one of its hi-tech arms costs around £30,000 including fitting and training. The arm typically has a lifespan of up to five years. “In specific cases the NHS will offer to provide this piece of technology, but they are relatively expensive – and they aren’t always appropriate for every amputee,” says Steeper, who is the third generation of the Steeper family to have worked in the business. Steeper's bebonic hand relies on Formula 1 technology to create precise movements The company was established in 1921 by his grandfather, Hugh. The original aim was to supply soldiers returning from war with artificial limbs, which back then were often made from wood. As the business developed, it later specialised in making upper limb prosthetics and first explored articulated hands in the 1960s. Steeper, which now has annual turnover of around £32.5m, was taken over by private equity firm Dunedin 10 years ago. Development of the bebionic arm started in 2009 after £1.5m was invested to create the technology. The company is now working on an electric wrist rotator and a bionic elbow to allow people to have a fully functioning complete artificial arm. A powered elbow could be developed in two years. “We’re currently looking at how the technology would work,” says Steeper. “A challenge is how the patient would control it and how it would fit in everyday life. It needs to flex and extend naturally, and work in conjunction with a bionic arm. As importantly, it needs to be powerful but light and quiet.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T22:02:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
