(AP) -- The National Park Service is celebrating the reopening of the Albright Visitor Center at Yellowstone National Park. The center in Mammoth Hot Springs was closed in the fall of 2013 to allow construction crews to retrofit the building to better withstand earthquakes and to make it more accessible. The grand reopening is scheduled for Sunday. The center was originally built as bachelor officer's quarters by the U.S. Army in 1909 and served a variety of purposes before being made into a visitor center. Exhibits and displays inside the center also received a makeover.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T17:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T19:14:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
