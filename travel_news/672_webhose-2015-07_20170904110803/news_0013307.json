As you might expect, that means you'll be surrounded by fine dining opportunities, and some of those are bound to include shellfish. \nYet the cuisine you enjoy today will be very different to the more ancient shellfish eating traditions once experienced. \nLondon's history of shellfish eating \nToday, most fine dining restaurants in London hotel establishments that include shellfish on the menu will usually have a French, Mediterranean or perhaps far eastern culinary background. Even when served in what might be called a traditional British restaurant, the chances are that there will be relatively little to distinguish the shellfish they serve from that you might find in a French or Thai restaurant. \nBut for many centuries, Britain, and particularly the capital, had a tradition of shellfish eating. Things such as oysters were very clearly the food of the poor, in fact, so much so that you can still see evidence of their mass consumption in the archaeological levels uncovered beneath the city streets. But in fact, anybody Londoner much over 50, may well be able to remember the days when a shellfish “tea” on a Sunday evening was the norm.Typically this would have been served with brown bread and butter plus a healthy selection of cockles, whelks, brown shrimps, mussels and perhaps even oysters. Jellied eels, cockles and mussels stalls were relatively commonplace, and people would stop off for a plate of whatever was on offer, as opposed to today’s quick bacon roll! \nToday, much of that tradition has disappeared. Echoes might still be found in locations such as the very famous Tubby Isaac’s jellied eel stall in Aldgate, but it is rapidly becoming a dying cuisine that has largely disappeared. \nWhat changed?People have speculated about the impact on such delicacies of fast food and American eating habits that arrived in the UK in the 1960s. Some blame the rising cost of shellfish and the others the advertising tactics of the food industry. But you can’t exclude the effects of the very negative publicity around fish and shellfish that first started in the 1970s, relating to things such as pollution and its effects on the ocean. The next generation started to regard fish as being somehow ‘dirty’, unless it was cut into squares, dipped in batter or breadcrumbs and fried. Then there were the supermarkets that managed to persuade people that prawns and cockles came preserved in jars with their shells already removed! \nSo can you still get good traditional shellfish in London? \nYes you can, and it may not be that far from where you're staying in your London hotel in Kensington. At the time of writing, the abovementioned Tubby Isaacs stall and one or two other brave sellers are attempting to fight a rear-guard action by bringing their products into the very centre of Kensington. \nThe staff of your London hotel will doubtless be a valuable source of information about local restaurants and eateries in the Kensington area, so they may well be able to point you in the direction of one of the city's last remaining shellfish stalls.
