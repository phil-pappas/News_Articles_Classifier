Reviews from users seem to be very positive, with one writing that she was 'able to totally re-adjust my sleep schedule' using the glasses (although she did admit they must have looked strange to observers).\nThe glasses are yours for a cool £165.50 from re-timer.com.\n3 Air conditioned clothes\nIf travelling makes you hot under the collar, why not purchase a pair of air conditioned trousers to keep you cool on the move?\nAir-conditioned clothing specialists (yes really) Kuchofuku have put their innovative minds to chilling the lower half of our bodies.\nAnts in your pants? Not any more with these air-conditioned cooling trousers, suitable for the hottest climes\nKuchofuku Air-Conditioned Cooling Pants have a battery-powered fan hanging on the outside of the pants so as not to add too much weight, all the while keeping you cool even in the blazing heat.\nWhile the pants are available in a range of sizes, you might not be able to colour co-ordinate with your bikini as the pants come only 'in a simple green color that will match most situations and wardrobes'.\n4 For a little extra help in public conveniences\nIf the lavatories in foreign countries are not to your liking - and let's face it not every woman is cool with those hole-in-the-floor toilets - then the Urinelle feminine urinating tube is at hand.\nOne of many 'handy' portable weeing devices now on the market, it can be used in conjunction with the 'Peebol' mini portable toilet: a small bag containing crystals which soak up urine.\nThe Urinelle 'urinating tube for women' could come in handy for those, 'I'm not sitting on THAT seat' situations (left) while the 'sani squares' will keep your feet dry and smelling sweet (right) in manky toilet cubicles\nAnd on the subject of sanitary gadgets for toilets, SkyMall is selling a product called Sani Squares Germ Barriers (in small and large sizes) which means you don't have to even make contact with the floor of a public lavatory if you don't want to.\nThe disposable, foam-backed squares are designed to be carried in your handbag so you can protect your feet from unsanitary floors wherever you go. You may need to carry a bigger handbag however.\n5 All wrapped up\nOn the subject of hygiene, much has been written recently about how 'unclean' seats on a flight can be, with one story recently of a man having to sit in the vomit of a previous passenger.\nBut now you can bring your own seat cover. With germfreebee.com you can' wrap yourself up in a specially designed blanket' before you buckle in. Or you could just bring your own sheet or blanket...\n6 Don't worry about freckles, jelly fish or sunburn\nThe 'facekini', a mask worn by many Chinese women to protect them from the sun's ultraviolet rays may make you look a little like Hannibal Lecter, but these fabric monstrosities serve a dual purpose.\nThe masks were invented a couple of years ago to prevent sunburn, and although they haven't exactly taken off in the West, there are very popular in China.\nThey will also ensure you can keep on swimming even if you encounter a shoal of jellyfish - as the creatures can't sting through the material. Genius.\nA Chinese woman and her daughter wear 'facekinis' in the Yellow Sea in Qingdao, China\n7 The sand-resistant beach towel\nOne Australian entrepreneur says he has invented a beach towel that will not transfer sand from the beach to, well, anywhere else.\nThe first sand and waterproof beach towel apparently utilises 'patent protected technology which prevents water seeping through the towel and sand sticking to the underside. The result is a sand-free beach experience, and a clean, dry car after a day at the beach.'\n'Wow, I love your sand-free towel, can I have a go please?' A talking point on the beach if ever there was one\nUnlike a normal beach towel where the sand can get trapped in the loopy fibres, apparently 'the Sandusa's smooth nylon backing allows sand to slip off easily, leaving it dry and sand free.'\nSurely fans of the Sandusa the Aussie Beach Volleyball team can't be wrong.\n8 The jacket for storing and hiding gadgets\nOffering the comfort and appearance of an ordinary jacket or sweatshirt, the Baubax Traveler’s Jacket features a staggering 15 hidden pockets for gadgets and accessories including an insulated cup holder.\nPassengers can enjoy a hands-free journey by using pockets designed to store a 10” Apple iPad, a camera, bottle, passport, sunglasses, pen, phone and charger.

Also available for water bottles.\nOf course!
