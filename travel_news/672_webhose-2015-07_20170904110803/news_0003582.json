In doing so, Greyhound becomes the first US-based intercity bus company to operate domestic service within Mexico. \nStarting today, Greyhound will operate more than 23 departures per day, connecting Monterrey to Nuevo Laredo and major hubs in Texas. Thirteen daily schedules will be between Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo, and 10 daily schedules will connect Monterrey to several Texas cities. The route includes Monterrey – Nuevo Laredo – Laredo - San Antonio – Austin – Dallas. \n\"Service in Mexico has long been an aspiration of Greyhound, making the launch an especially meaningful event,\" said Dave Leach, CEO of Greyhound. \"As an iconic American brand that has more than 100 years of experience providing the gold standard of bus travel to our customers, we're looking forward to bringing our high-quality service, safety and convenience to Mexico.\" \nCustomers can relax in the newly built private terminals in both Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo, which offer a clean, open and secure environment with amenities such as free Wi-Fi and charging stations. Each terminal will feature ample free parking spaces, making it easy for passengers to be picked up or dropped off by family members and friends. In addition, the terminals have paid long-term parking for customers. The Monterrey terminal is located at Carretera Colombia #031, Colonia Residencial Puerta del Norte. It is right next to the Senvero Station at the end of the northern Metro line. The Nuevo Laredo terminal is located at Cesar Lopez de Lara #3910, Colonia Anáhuac. \nGreyhound's new buses have safety features such as three-point seatbelts at every seat and modern amenities that include free on-board Wi-Fi, power outlets, leather seats, guaranteed seating, extra legroom, footrests and on-board restrooms. \nAn inauguration and ribbon-cutting ceremony will be held at each terminal later this summer as a celebration for the community and to honor government officials who have welcomed Greyhound to Mexico.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T05:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T07:44:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
