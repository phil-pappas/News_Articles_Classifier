After all, in our globalized world, economic policy is foreign policy. Decisions made by the Federal Reserve have consequences for other countries, for instance. But with institutions experimenting with the cryptocurrency, it raises an intriguing question: How can bitcoin influence foreign policy? \nFinancing Cyber Attacks \nBitcoin could be used by governments to incentivize and finance cyber attacks. A defense policy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations suggests that the U.S. should make anonymous bitcoin payments to \"hacktivists\" so that they train their attention on enemy groups. On first blush, it sounds like a half-baked idea: trying to herd and guide a loose coterie of hackers towards a foreign policy goal. But the thought experiment deserves points for creativity. Implementing such an idea would require a non-profit organization, funded partly by the U.S., which makes bitcoin payments to hackers who wreak havoc on social media accounts and technology platforms that belong to the enemy. \n\"These paid volunteers could also harass...[the enemy]...with phishing and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks -- the bread and butter of today's online vigilantes,\" writes the policy expert . These hackers would want to be paid in bitcoin, which is more difficult to trace. Of course, using bitcoin in this manner cuts both ways. Enemy states and non-state actors could also whip up legions of hackers, and pay them using bitcoin. Nevertheless, bitcoin may become part of a nation's foreign policy toolkit. \nMust Read: The 15 Best Dividend Stocks of the Past 25 Years \nA Currency to Attract Tourists \nSuffering through an economic crisis, Greece needs more revenue. Historically, tourism has provided as much as 25% of Greece's income. But because of the crisis, and despite the resulting lower prices, many tourists have canceled their trips. To lure tourists to Greece, U.S.-based investment adviser Brian Kelly has floated bitcoin as a solution . Because of the Greek bank holiday (which is over), it was difficult for citizens and tourists to withdraw funds. He is creating a parallel currency known as Nautiluscoin, based on bitcoin technology, which he believes will calm concerns about traveling to Greece. The Greek island of Agistri will pilot the currency later this year. \nHere's how it works: \n1. Tourists visiting Agistri can buy items from merchants who accept Nautiluscoin; \n2. Each transaction generates a fee that goes toward a fund that buys gold that stabilizes the price of the currency. A stable currency that maintains its purchasing power should attract merchants and tourists, according to Kelly. \"This currency isn't going to solve the Greek debt problem,\" Kelly said on a phone call. \"But it will assure tourists that they can buy items without worry.\" 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T19:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T19:28:05.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
