Sending in the nomination was Tilly Dis, an eTN reader, and publicist from Victoria, Australia. \nShe said: “We recently spent a night at the Clico Boutique Hotel, and the personal attention to detail was superb. The highlight of our stay was that the hotel’s chef catered to our dietary requirements. If advised 24 hours before one’s arrival, the hotel will accommodate your request.\" \n“We had the best poached eggs ever for breakfast, and the salmon dinner was perfectly prepared. Without being 'in your face,' the staff showed how much they really care about its guests. The Clico Boutique Hotel is a special understated 5-star hotel which is happily also affordable.” \nTilly went on to tell eTN that the hotel’s General Manager, Sabine Seeger, was kind and spoke several languages. She said her experience with international travelers shows, and she made them feel like they weren’t just a number. “We were people she wanted to please at the hotel,” Tilly said. \n“I am a travel writer and publicist specializing in luxury travel and fine dining, and this hotel provides consistently excellent service and has proved its worth over the past 9 years that I have stayed there during my travels,” Tilly added. \n“We all love luxurious travel, fine food, and wine, however, it does not have to be opulent to make you feel special as a guest. I have utilized the hotel as a guest and even held a cocktail party there some years ago. The catering was superb, and our guests did not want to leave!” she said. \neTN publisher Juergen T. Steinmetz said of the nomination: “Boutique hotels are in demand these days. Travelers are often looking for this type of accommodation in order to experience a stay in a more intimate setting with a personal touch, and the Clico Boutique Hotel extended this type of welcome to eTN Reader Tilly Dix who hails from Victoria, Australia. We are pleased to add them to THE LIST .” \nSo how does one make it on THE LIST? Anyone can nominate a hotel, destination, attraction, airline, person, cruise, or restaurant based on a best moment or experience. THE LIST is not about rating how “luxurious” something is. It is more about how much something is appreciated or different. \nSabine Seeger, General Manager of the Clico Boutique Hotel, said: “Our team strives to meet our guests’ every hospitality, function, and fine dining need. We are adamant about doing this in a genuine and unpretentious manner, as our focus is on growing the amount of our return guests. Our regulars are our passion, and based on the amount of frequent return guests that visit our establishment, this element has proven to be the most rewarding feature in Clico’s 9-year existence.” \nOpened in 2006, the Clico Boutique Hotel is perfectly situated in the surprisingly tranquil, leafy, and upmarket suburb of Rosebank in Johannesburg, South Africa. Its location is convenient, being just 900 meters from the Rosebank Gautrain station, with business hubs such as Sandton reachable within 5 minutes by train and the OR Tambo International airport only 20 “stress-free” minutes away. Ideally and centrally located, Clico is within walking distance from the newly-refurbished Rosebank Mall, as well as the Rosebank Clinic. \nClico was established by Jeanette Schwegman who wanted to cater to the travel-weary and discerning guest. Poised to accommodate corporate guests as well as leisure-seeking tourists, this 60-year-old Cape Dutch building is an engaging mix of old and new. The name “Clico” was inspired by Jeanette’s passion for champagne, with her favorite being Veuve Clicquot. \nGuests who prefer a more intimate, somewhat unpretentious establishment which offers attention to all the important details, as well as personalized interaction with staff, will find Clico to be a hotel they will want to return to again and again. \nClico offers comfortable rooms, delectable cuisine, and unique function facilities, and its rates are highly competitive and are even reduced on weekends – something almost unheard of. Cost for the rooms include a full breakfast as well as free Wi-Fi and coffee/tea-making facilities. Clico’s cuisine is unique and known for its element of fine dining, and is comprised of daily seasonal menus. \nTo make a nomination for THE LIST , go to honesttravelawards.com. \nFor more information about Clico Boutique Hotel,visit http://www.clicohotel.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T10:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T15:32:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
