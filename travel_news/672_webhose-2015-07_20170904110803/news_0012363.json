The couple were on a make or break trip. Source: Supplied\nPaul Rossington and Kristen Schroder. Source: Supplied\nThe couple went overboard some time after 8.40pm but their disappearance was not noticed until 10am the next day when they failed to disembark in Sydney.\nAn air and sea search of 1400sq km by the navy, NSW police and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority failed to find their bodies.\nMr Dillon said Ms Schroder had suffered from anxiety, depression and a sense of insecurity.\nThe couple of 10 months had a “volatile” relationship and viewed the trip as a “make or break” holiday for their relationship.\nTrust was sore spot and there were hangovers from previous relationships. They would oscillate between break-ups and reconciliation. Ms Schroder, family members said, had a “flair for drama”.\nRecognising she needed help, she reached out to a psychologist.

The most likely explanation is that Kristen, being unafraid of heights, was making a dramatic gesture to alarm and test Paul.” Infra-red CCTV footage showed her standing on the outside of the ship for a few seconds before falling.\nIt then captured Mr Rossington doing a “safety jump” after her.\nMr Dillon said one of the tragic aspects of the case was that what the couple wanted from each other in life they probably achieved by going overboard together.\n“What they had struggled to achieve in life, loving unity, they probably managed in their last actions alive.” Kristen Schroder’s mother Roxene Dennis, sister Denise and brother.
