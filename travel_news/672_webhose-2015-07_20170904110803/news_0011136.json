We talk to Olivia about the absence of the female voice in film, and how we can combat the gender imbalance on- and off-screen. As a woman in my 50s, I haven’t found it tough to get commissioned as a screenwriter. A small number of female screenwriters in the industry get a lot of work. Too much work, in fact. If you are an established, successful female screenwriter, then you usually won’t have an issue getting commissioned. But this applies to a small handful of women, and it’s certainly not the case for female screenwriters on the whole. The safe bet In the film industry , there’s an aversion to risk. When you’re making a film, producers and funders will look for a safe bet, and screenwriters with a successful track record. Without that stamp of success, there is a huge risk. Unfortunately, the figures show that there are fewer female screenwriters, so that in itself makes women screenwriters look risky to those key decision makers. Olivia wrote the screenplay for Girl With A Pearl Earring, starring Colin Firth and Scarlett Johansson Part of the problem is that the commissioning process is economically-driven, and these films are intended to make money. Producers and funders need the reassurance that they are making the right decision commercially. Screenwriter Olivia Hetreed explains how she came to write the script for Girl with a Pearl Earring Where are all the women directors? Wuthering Heights: review Why are there so few female screenwriters? The absence of the female voice In general, the figures are not getting better and the number of female screenwriters is not increasing. But the important question is – what is the effect of that? And, why does it matter? I think what it boils down to is that when we’re not representing women’s voices, the stories of women will be untold. Women comprised 12 per cent of protagonists on-screen in the top 100 films of 2014. The statistics show that on a global scale, women write fewer scripts, have shorter careers, received fewer commissions and earn less money than their male counterparts. If we want to combat the absence of the female voice in film and TV, we should look to Denmark as a shining example. Across the industry there, women represent 50 per cent of writers, and this applies to the scandi-noirs that we watch in the UK. Olivia at the Writers' Guild of Great Britain (WGGB) Awards in January 2015 (Guy Cragoe/WGGB) The figures might look like female screenwriters are making a breakthrough, but there’s a persistent mythology that things are changing dramatically once a few figures make things look better. It's time for a change There needs to be a more comprehensive rethinking by all institutions in order to change the habit of making the same decisions. At the World Conference of Screenwriters last year, a unanimous resolution was carried asking industry heads to set a goal of having 50 per cent of all scripts written by women. That goal applies to films of all genres, and at every budget level. Once you impose a shift on the system, it’s amazing to see how quickly the landscape changes. We’re seeing evidence of this in Israel, where a decision was made to enforce positive discrimination in the film industry. It’s proved very effective, and the number of female screenwriters has increased dramatically there to around 50 per cent. Age is an advantage I don’t think there’s necessarily a closed door once you reach a certain age. In fact, most screenwriters are over the age of 40, as much of their early years are spent writing TV and radio scripts in order to get established. In terms of age, it’s generally considered that age is a benefit to writing; you have more life experience, more empathy, more subject matter. Olivia's tips for screenwriters Find comfort in numbers – find other writers to work with so you’re not alone on a project. Think carefully about the type of film you want to write, and the kind of people who would want to make it. Ultimately, screenwriting requires hard graft. So, just get on and do it. The Writers' Guild is a fantastic resource for writers, offering support.
