HHW are household products that contain potentially hazardous ingredients that may be corrosive, toxic, ignitable or reactive and require special care when it comes to disposal such as used batteries, light bulbs and electronic/electrical devices. The Centre’s HHW collection point is located at the Concourse Level, Centre Core, and is open from 9.00am to 10.00pm daily, until 31 December 2015. \n\n\nOther on-going sustainability and conservation efforts practiced by the Centre include a 3R (reduce, re-use and recycle) campaign to encourage staff and visitors to reduce wastage, and re-use and recycle where possible; sponsorship of 290 trees to date under the Forest Research Institute of Malaysia’s (FRIM) Conservation Culture Programme with monies allocated for door and speaker gifts from her annual Association Seminar since 2010; use biodegradable cleaning products; minimal use of pesticides; sourcing of products from environmentally-conscious suppliers and locally-produced products for the culinary department; and fine-tuning systems like lighting control and on-demand escalators ie, motionless unless being used by a guest, for energy savings, and encouraging delegate participation in the Malaysia Convention & Exhibition Bureau’s (MyCEB) ‘Let’s Meet & Green’ tree-planting programme. \n\n\nThemed ‘Sustainable Consumption and Production’, World Environment Day 2015 was celebrated on 5 June to raise global awareness of positive environmental action to protect nature and planet Earth.
