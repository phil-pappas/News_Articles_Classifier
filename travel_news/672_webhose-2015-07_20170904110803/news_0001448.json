Stars including Michael J Fox and Sigourney Weaver have helped to increase the show’s size and appeal, as it prepares to take over half the West London venue for three days from Friday 17 to Sunday 19 July. \nLondon Film & Comic Con is also on course to surpass the 95,000 visitors figure recorded last year at Earls Court. Day tickets for Saturday and Sunday passes have completely sold out and organisers have closed press pass applications owing to overwhelming demand for tickets. As well as being bigger in size, the show is expected to be even better and more brimming with content for its move to Olympia London. Four of the venue’s seven spaces in use for the event, including Olympia London Conference Centre, secured just this week, as well as Olympia Central, Olympia West and Olympia National and National gallery allow numerous zones and activities to be staged simultaneously. Anna Golden, Commercial Director at Olympia London said, “We’re delighted to be welcoming London Film & Comic Con, a jam-packed and exciting show for fans to meet their idols in film, books and TV and experience intriguing entertainment inspired by eclectic interests.” Jason Joiner, Managing Director of Showmasters said, “Showmasters brought the first 'comic con' style event to the UK , so it’s great to see how London Film & Comic Con and all our events have grown and developed over the past two decades into the events we always wanted them to be. \"We’ve been running events since the 1980s - we offer the best line up of Hollywood talent that is second to none anywhere in the world. Showmasters is recognised as the leader in this industry on being able to deliver amazing A-list guests where the fans get real opportunities to meet their idols face to face; fandom is massive now and it’s only getting bigger. We see an amazing future for London Film & Comic Con with the only issues being \"we are going to need a bigger boat” (Jaws 1976).” Olympia London offers 42,910m² of space across seven, flexible and connected venues.
