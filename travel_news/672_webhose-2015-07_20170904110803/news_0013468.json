Further developments are planned for Edinburgh and London in 2016 and beyond. Aparthotels Adagio® are primarily aimed at mid and long-stay visitors providing attractive tiered pricing from the fourth night onwards. Vangelis Porikis, Adagio Director Central & Northern Europe, said: “The UK continues to be a key market for growth and we are delighted to open our second property in the UK’s second city, Birmingham.

The business has seen solid growth in recent years and we are on track to open 150 aparthotels worldwide by 2018 with 15,000 apartments particularly in key European Countries, Latin America, Middle East and Africa.” Dave Amans, General Manager, Adagio Birmingham City Centre, added: “Birmingham has undergone a tremendous transformation in recent years and the regeneration of the city continues into the Digbeth area in which we are located.
