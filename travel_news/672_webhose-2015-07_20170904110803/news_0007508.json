So, why not take those crazy, chaotic kid moments on the road, deal with it and enjoy it all for what it is.”\nHe’s written works of fiction and non-fiction and this time he’s aiming for the funny bone in his family travelogue centred on the nine-week cross-Canada road trip he, his wife Catharine, a physiotherapist, and their three children, Andrew, 11, Ryan, 9, and Jenna, 7, took during the summer of 2013.\nFrom June to late August the family travelled in their Honda Odyssey van staying at inexpensive cabins, hotels and motels and making occasional pit stops along the way to visit relatives in Ontario and P.E.I.\n“We wanted it to be an educational trip for the kids and give them hands on experience,” said Palmer. “So we visited things like the Terry Fox monument (Thunder Bay), went to see the whales and other points of interest our kids would have read about in school.”\nWorking as a team, the Palmer’s all had input in the planning of their road trip — where they were going and where they would stay along the way.\n“Everything was totally planned because you had to be on time for things like the ferry to Newfoundland, which has to be booked ahead of time, as did the baseball game we went to see in Toronto,” he said.\n“If you don’t, you’ll loose your place (on the ferry), and any kind of interruption throws your whole schedule off , so when you don’t make it to the hotel or the event you’re planning to go to you’re going to lose your money and could find yourself without a place to stay.”\nPalmer and his wife realized the kids had to be occupied and they didn’t want to rely on TV and videos to keep them entertained, so they limited that activity to 45 minutes a day.\nCatharine Palmer put together an entertainment bag for each of their kids packed with books, puzzles and other things they could access whenever they wanted.\nVehicle safety and cleanliness was an important factor, so the Palmers made sure the van was prepped for the trip by having it mechanically checked over from the tires to the drive train. And they stocked up on everything they’d need to keep the interior clean in the event of spills and other messy possibilities.\nWhile navigating the Trans-Canada Highway was simple enough, GPS came in handy getting them to their booked accommodation or finding restaurants and stores when ever they got into cities and towns.\n“We all got pretty good at it,” Palmer said. “At the beginning there was a bit of ‘Aw, I don’t like this place, or I don’t like this bed’, but as the weeks progressed the kids became seasoned road warriors. They learned to adapt and that will go a long way in their lives.”\nThat’s not to say it was smooth sailing all the way, as in any family situation there is the potential for tantrums and other tribulations due to tiredness, boredom, or a number of other factors.\n“It seems funny now, but we had an incident in Corner Brook, Newfoundland,” Palmer said. “We were racing to get to the ferry on time and the kids were getting antsy, so we made a quick stop to get a movie.\n“Each kid of course wants a different movie and the next thing I know one of them is sprawled out on the floor crying. I’ve got one kid under my arm and another’s hanging onto my leg and the cashier was thinking we were the worst parents in the world.\n“We finally decided on a movie, got back into the van in the pouring rain and managed to make it onto the boat on time. And soon we were all laughing about it.”\nWhile every stop was planned on the road east, the Palmer’s decided to do the opposite on the return trip.\n“We thought ‘let’s just drive and whenever we felt like we were done for the day we’d just stop at the nearest hotel. It was late August past the high season and we managed to find places to stay where we wanted.”\nWhile mom is the family’s principal photographer, the kids got to take their share of pictures and by the time they got home they had more than 2,000 images of their road trip adventure.\n“A trip like that is a great way for a family to reconnect,” said Palmer. “There are those little moments that happen when you’re all together and they add up to family memories that last a lifetime.”\nSince their 2013 Canadian road trip, the Palmer family lived in a Costa Rican surfing and yoga community, populated by North American and European ex-pats, with an international school the kids attended.\nThey are now re-settling in Calgary.\n“After a year away we just wanted to get back to some normalcy,” said Palmer, the day after he arrived in Calgary a couple of weeks ahead of his wife and kids.\nThat ‘normalcy’ will see Andrew, Ryan and Jenna reconnect with their Calgary school chums and they’ll have travel stories to tell until the next big trip comes around.\nPalmer said that journey may involve living near Barcelona, Spain for a year, where the skiing is just an hour away in one direction and the Mediterranean beaches about the same distance the other way.\nAnd then there’s the family’s collective yearning to go across Canada by van once again, but this time on a northern route taking in the upper prairies, James Bay region, Gaspe and Labrador.\nIt should be a laugh, either way.\nPalmer’s book based on the family’s Canadian road trip is expected to be published in the fall, while his mystery novel, The Leaf Cutter, will be available later this month.\nMore on thestar.com\nOpen House\nAlicia Silverstone carries emotional baggage in Of Good Stock", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T08:44:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
