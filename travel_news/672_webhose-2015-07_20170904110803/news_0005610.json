Expanded service includes new flights to Mexico City International Airport (MEX); General Rafael Buelna International Airport (MZT) in Mazatlan, Mexico; Curacao International Airport (CUR); Sangster International Airport (MBJ) in Montego Bay, Jamaica; Punta Cana International Airport (PUJ); Gregorio Luperon International Airport (POP) in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic; and Mariscal Sucre International Airport (UIO) in Quito, Ecuador, pending regulatory approvals. \n“As the premier carrier to Mexico, the Caribbean and Latin America with flights to 85 destinations, these additions highlight our commitment to providing our customers with a network that is second to none,” said Art Torno, American’s senior vice president for Mexico, the Caribbean and Latin America. “We are committed to each country we serve, and these new routes allow us to contribute to and further promote travel and tourism to and from the region.” American also plans to reinstate its service between New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK) and Simon Bolívar International Airport (CCS) in Caracas, Venezuela, on Dec. 17. Flights will operate five times per week with Boeing 757 aircraft. Those flights are now available for bookings. Customers traveling to these destinations will have the ability to connect through American’s hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles and New York from nearly 200 destinations worldwide. With these new routes, American will operate more than 1,750 weekly flights throughout Mexico, the Caribbean and Latin America – more service than any other airline. In addition to the 85 destinations throughout Mexico, the Caribbean and Latin America, American has served Cuba since 1991 with charter flights from Miami and Tampa to five destinations in Cuba – Camagüey, Cienfuegos, Havana, Holguín and Santa Clara.

American is investing $2 billion in planned improvements to give customers a superior travel experience around the world. These capital investments include fully lie-flat seats; international Wi-Fi; more in-flight entertainment options and power outlets and a new, modern design for Admirals Club lounges worldwide. American is taking delivery of more than 100 new aircraft this year, giving it the youngest fleet of any U.S.-based network carrier. Aircraft to be delivered in the coming years include the Airbus A320 and A320neo family, A350-900, Boeing 737, 737 MAX, 777-300ER and 787, which will make American's fleet even younger, more modern and fuel efficient.
