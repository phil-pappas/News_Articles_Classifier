Credit: flickr.com/ UK Ministry of Defence \nMembers of the Queen's Guard are known for remaining stoic despite tourist shenanigans - but this tourist found himself looking down the barrel of a guard's rifle for his antics. \nA video of the tourist and the guard's interaction has gone viral - amassing almost 8.9 million views since June 22. \nThe video shows a guard marching, as a tourist attempts to imitate him. \nAs per usual, the guard ignores the tourist - right up until the tourist touches the guard's shoulder - the same shoulder which his rifle is leaning against. \nThe guard then grabs his rifle, points it at the tourist (who darts away quicker than you can say \"my bad\") and shouts: \"Get back from the Queen's Guard!\" \nNote to self - never touch a guard's gun. \nWatch the entertaining video below: Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-30T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T06:52:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
