But the perfect break can take many different shapes - even within one destination.\nCase in point: Mexico's Playa del Carmen. Just an hour from Cancun airport, it is a relaxed holiday town buzzing with shops, bars and restaurants.\nHowever many of the most well-known resorts in that area are located about 20 minutes out of town, the trade-off being beach proximity and private villas. So which one is for you? We took a long weekend to find out...\nIN-TOWN BOUTIQUE\nThe brand new Hotel Cacao was our first destination, a boutique five-star property situated bang in the middle of Playa del Carmen's main pedestrianised strip. Though the street outside is buzzy, the hotel itself is incredibly tranquil, thanks in part to the main atrium's waterfall wall and turtle-dwelling lily pond.\nIdyllic: The highlight of the Hotel Cacao is the rooftop infinity pool and adjoining bar\nSpacious: The rooms are generously-sized, with a wide window at one end overlooking a quiet side street\nSharp design: The five-star property's striking interior atrium\nAfter half a day of travel from New York, my friend and I could not have been more delighted with our room. Generously-sized with two double beds, the wide window at one end overlooked a quiet side street, while the other end boasted a spacious bathroom with twin sinks, a rain shower and Missoni bath products.\n Eating live maggots, drinking muddy river water and fending...

The place where street lights, signs and wifi don't exist!... 17 shares\nThe real highlight at Hotel Cacao though, is the rooftop infinity pool. To our joy, the space was not overcrowded when we pitched up at 2pm and we parked our exhausted selves on two plush sun loungers for the rest of the afternoon. There were plenty of parasols for fair-skinned guests and the staff were attentive and charming as they ferried over chilled wine and fresher-than-fresh ceviche. 'Never. Leaving,' we repeated to each other several times over.\nCacao's own restaurant, Nibs, is considered one of the finest dining spots in town, so we were eager to check it out. Dinner can be enjoyed downstairs in the main restaurant, adjoining the lobby area, or - what appears to be the more popular option - at the rooftop bar by the pool.\nKeep the ceviche coming! We enjoyed healthy poolside snacks while we worked on our tans\nHungry for more: Nibs is considered one of the finest dining spots in town\nKiller cocktails: We were sold several times over on the margaritas at Hotel Cacao's rooftop bar\nAnd what a dinner it is. It kicked off with a couple of killer margaritas and piping hot Yucatan 'black bread' which is cooked in plantain leaves and served in a paper bag. A series of impressive dishes ensued including plenty of lobster and a sensational chocolate-chili confection for dessert.\nHotel Cacao's rooftop bar is fast becoming a scene and it was the perfect place for a post-dinner margarita.\nWe loved that the hotel's location allowed us to check out other local bars and restaurants too, and is just a short walk to the beach. But you also have the option to not engage and simply recharge your batteries.\nHotel Cacao has a special promotion beginning in May, with rates starting at $184 (£121.54) per night including breakfast.

This idyllic resort really knows luxury - no wonder it was booked out most weekends by New Yorkers escaping the (then) snow.\nA Mayan blessing from the in-house shaman, a privilege granted to every guest, sets the mood for the next two days.\nCan we move in? Each guest gets their own jungle villa, complete with private plunge pool and hammock\nEach villa is equipped with essentials such as a mosquito-repelling kit, handmade soap and shots of Mezcal\nAll guests get to relax in their own hammock and outdoor shower\nGuests' plunge pool and bedroom are in very close proximity\nEach guest - or couple, rather, this place seems geared towards romance - gets their own jungle villa, complete with private plunge pool, hammock and outdoor shower. The room was, as one would expect, beautifully appointed, but what was more impressive was that they'd really thought of everything.\nWe loved that they provided us with a mosquito-repelling kit (neither of us were bitten once), there was a bowl of apples in the room for snacking between meals, and even a couple of miniature bottles of Mezcal for a pre-dinner aperitif.\nBut the piece-de-resistance is undoubtedly the breathtaking location; a beautifully-maintained pool area nestles seamlessly into the white sandy beach.\nThe piece-de-resistance is undoubtedly the beautifully-maintained pool area nestling into the white sandy beach\nBeachside dining: The casual Coral Grill and Bar is one of two restaurants on-site at the resort\nThe Viceroy Riviera Maya's ocean location is breathtaking, with azure waters never more than a hop, skip and a jump away. Pictured are massage beds on the hotel's wooden pier\nPictured here is the hotel's fertility treatment room located in the spa\nPrivilege: Guests are offered a Mayan blessing from the in-house shaman on arrival\nThe Viceroy Riviera Maya has two restaurants - the casual Coral Grill and Bar and the more romantic setting of La Marea, the latter a gourmet Mexican restaurant. Both restaurants can be quiet as many guests opt instead for the separate room service menu on offer. On the topic of noise, the resort is adult-only so bear that in mind if a family retreat is needed.\nThe impeccable yet unintrusive service is part of the appeal, as every little whim is catered for. Indeed, they’ve thought of everything from a soap concierge (yes, really) to complimentary diving shoes to brave the rocky shoreline.\nThis theme continues by the pool. Appropriately chic straw hats of various shapes and sizes are available to borrow alongside the beach towels.\nAmenities include a highly-rated spa and yoga classes, but we never made it beyond the comfortable sunbeds on the beach.\nIn fact, it was all over far too soon. Call the shaman - we're planning our return already.\nRates at the Viceroy Riviera Maya start at $393 (259.59) per night. For more information, visit Viceroyhotelsandresorts.com\nTRAVEL FACTS Cancun is the nearest airport, located just an hour's drive from Playa del Carmen.\nTravellers can fly direct from London with a number of carriers including British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, Thomson Airways, Condor and Thomas Cook Airlines.\nTamara travelled direct from New York. There are several flights a day with United, American AIrlines, JetBlue and AeroMexico.\nRead more: Hotel Cacao : Hotel Boutique Playa del Carmen Riviera Maya Resort: Luxury Resort in Playa del Carmen -Viceroy", "external_links": ["http://www.viceroyhotelsandresorts.com/en/rivieramaya", "http://hotelcacao.com.mx/", "http://dailym.ai/1JbWAO7"], "published": "2015-07-12T16:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T17:37:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
