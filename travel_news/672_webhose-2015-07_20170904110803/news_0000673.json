We are seeing deals to select destinations in Europe, Asia, Central America, South America, the South Pacific and the Middle East.\nDiscounts of up to 25 percent are available for kids 2 to 11, but keep in mind that it applies only to the base fare. It does not apply to taxes and fees, including the fuel surcharge, which can exceed $500 to Europe.\nWe found a $1,363 round-trip fare from Dallas to Paris in August. You might think the kids’ discount off the adult fare would be $340, but it was $180 because the base fare was $723. The remaining amount of $640 included the fuel surcharge of $516, plus other government taxes and fees.\nWe recently saw a sale from more than 20 U.S. cities, including Dallas, to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam for $649 round trip for adults and $539 for kids. It’s a trip of about 17,000 miles round trip from Dallas, so that works out to be 3.8 cents per mile for adults and 3 cents per mile for kids, which is a bargain-basement rate.\nThere was no fuel surcharge to Vietnam, but other cities in Asia have surcharges that are much lower than what we see to Europe. Even though you’re traveling double the distance when you fly to Asia vs. Europe, you get a higher percentage off when you consider the total cost of the fare.\nWhile you don’t have to pay for an infant younger than 2 to travel as a lap baby in the U.S., you do have to pay a fee of 10 percent to many international destinations. The 10 percent fee is typically on the base fare, excluding the fuel surcharge, though you may have to pay some taxes. For example, we looked at a flight to Paris and the infant fee was $73, plus $64 in U.S. taxes and fees.\nIf your infant will turn 2 before you return, you will need to purchase a fare for the return portion of the trip. You should price a one-way fare and compare it with a round-trip ticket because the latter may be cheaper on international flights.\nWhen you travel internationally with an infant, you will need a passport. And if you are flying in the U.S. with a lap baby, I strongly suggest bringing a birth certificate. My sister was challenged at the airport with a very petite child, and she was able to use an immunization card to verify her child’s age; otherwise she would have had to pay for a ticket.\nPeople do try to sneak kids older than 2 as lap babies, and if you get caught, you’ll have to pay full fare. With no advance purchase, that could be hundreds more than what you paid for your ticket, and it’s not worth the risk.\nThe first thing you can do to see if there is a child discount is to price the fare for one traveler and then price it with one adult and one child, entering the age of the child. You can also look at the fare rules after you select flights and see if there is a child discount listed in the rules.\nRemember that just because there is a child discount, it doesn’t mean it’s your best fare. We found a fare to Bogota for $713 for an adult and $683 for a child, but there was a cheaper adult fare of $591 that didn’t offer a child’s discount.\nThe next time you travel abroad with children, make sure you enter their ages when booking so you can get a discount when it’s available. Child discounts vary by route and airline, but it only takes one or two airlines to get these discounts spreading like a virus, which we would like to see.\nTom Parsons is the editor of bestfares.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T23:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T13:13:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
