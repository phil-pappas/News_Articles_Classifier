The prestigious awards ceremony which was held at The Roundhouse saw Moving Venue cater for over 600 guests. A drinks reception on the terrace got the evening underway, which was then followed by a signature three-course dinner devised by Moving Venue’s chefs. \nThis year’s summer menu was designed with a refreshed approach as Moving Venue looks to grow and innovate within the industry. The summer spirit was certainly installed in a variety of dishes such as ‘Garden Pea Salad’ with garden pea and mint mousse, shaved purple radish and sugar snaps and ‘Duo of Beef’ with glazed golden beets, spinach puree and thyme-scented pan jus. Gail Heron, sales and marketing manager at Moving Venue said, “Over the last four years, this event has always been a highlight in our calendar. The Roundhouse is the perfect venue for this type of event and it’s a great pleasure to work with them on this project.” Jack Franklin, head of events at The Roundhouse commented, “We always enjoy working with Moving Venue. Their incredible food, serviced with their slick operational expertise makes them a pleasure to work alongside every time.” A rigorous six month entry and selection process culminates in the awards ceremony which recognises excellence in online publishing.
