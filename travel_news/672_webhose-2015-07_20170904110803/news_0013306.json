They are also sharing their knowledge about EM water with the local community. Centara Hotel & Convention Centre Udon Thani has developed an educational forum within the local community to help educate about various environmental initiatives. These are just a few of the many sustainable practices that are currently occurring at Centara properties. \n“At Centara, we understand that we need to work hard to reduce our impact on the environment and on the local community,” said Centara Hotels and Resorts’ CEO Khun Thirayuth Chirathivat. “It is energizing to see that there is a strong focus on sustainability in the hospitality industry in Thailand and around the world.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T11:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T15:15:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
