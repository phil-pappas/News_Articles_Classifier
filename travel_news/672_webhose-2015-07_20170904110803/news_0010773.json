(Instagram/Chrissy Teigen) \nA lesson in beauty is only a touchscreen away. From Queen Bee of music, Beyoncé, to the feisty model Chrissy Teigen, who is known for her sense of humour and an endearing devil-may-care attitude – the best beauty moments of the past few days have been full of inspiration. Not only high on likes, the pictures shared on celeb social accounts have also brought under focus makeup gyaan. Check out our favourite beauty moments that we scouted and voted for. 1 Chrissy cool Swimsuit model Chrissy Teigen, who is married to singer John Legend, created quite a stir on Instagram when she shared a picture of herself topless, which in-keeping with their policy, the picture sharing app removed. She continued to show off her glamorous side, and we loved this picture which showed off the big hair she sported for a magazine shoot. What stood out the most was the berry perfect lip colour! Spring’s here but dark hues are not taking a backseat. 2 Queen Bey’s braid That braid! We’ve loved fishtail and waterfall ties, but our favourite Beyonce’s workout-perfect braid steals the social media show with the sheer fierceness of it! Our favourite part about her look? The tightly pulled back hair in the front and the no-scrunchy or hair-tie policy to fasten the end of the braid. 3 Y’all know of strobing? Amber Heard Get over Kim Kardashian’s sharp contouring makeup that can make any face cut look like it’s chiselled and perfect, tap into what de-throned it — the art of strobing. The buzz word for the entire last week, the technique involves strategic placement of highlighting makeup wherever the light hits the face in daylight. 4 Freida is a minimalist desi Keep international red carpet aside and check out our very own Ms Pinto doing minimalistic chic as she visited the country recently. A stand-alone deep shade of scarlet for the lips for one event, and for her meeting with the PM, the trending no-makeup look. 5 Gomez’s pop glam We fell in love with singer Selena Gomez’s quirky beauty look as soon as we spotted this picture on her insta account. The oversized, pastel pink framed glasses added a pop art-esque vibe to the picture, and that messy hair — a laidback bout of chic. 6 Royalty goes hippie chic Model Cressida Bonas, known for dating Prince Harry, was spotted at the recent Glastonbury music fest, and stole our hearts with her sunset-hued glasses.
