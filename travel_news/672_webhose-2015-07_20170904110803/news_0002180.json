In an era of smart-phones and sat-nav, how could a passenger jet vanish into thin air? Oovvuu 11 Jun 2015 TV/Science TV/Technology TV/Current Affairs Massive ... The search area for MH370 is only a tiny part of the zone where the aircraft could have crashed. Picture: ATSB Source: Supplied \nTHE man overseeing the search for MH370 never dreamt they would still be hunting for the plane 500 days after it disappeared. \nToday marks the undesirable milestone in the baffling mystery of the Malaysia Airlines’ flight, that vanished soon after taking off from Kuala Lumpur to fly to Beijing on March 8 last year. \nIt is thought to have ditched into the southern Indian Ocean more than 2000km west of Perth but an extensive air, sea and underwater search has found no trace of the aircraft. Tough job ... Fugro Discovery encounters rough conditions in the southern Indian Ocean, as the search for MH370 continues. Picture: James Hancock. Source: Supplied \nIn an exclusive interview with News Corp, Australian Transport Safety Bureau Chief Commissioner Martin Dolan said in the early stages, the complexity of the search mission was not immediately apparent. \n“Once we started looking and defining the search area, it became quite clear it could take up to two years,” said Commissioner Dolan. \n“We still remain confident it will be found in the next year.” \nSo far, close to 60,000 square kilometres of the southern Indian Ocean has been scoured for MH370, leaving a little over 60,000 square kilometres to be searched. Search zone ... The hatched area represents the extended search zone, agreed to in March. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \nMr Dolan confirmed that if the Boeing 777 was not discovered in that area, the search would not continue. \n“All the analysis we have puts the aircraft somewhere in that large search area,” he said. \n“We have no more information that would allow us to calculate a different area and governments accept that.” \nThe completion of the search would also represent the limit of available funding, Mr Dolan said. \nBut he refused to entertain the possibility MH370 may never be found, or that it would be left to families to fund their own search. \n“It’s hard to speculate on what might happen if we’re not successful,” Commissioner Dolan said. \n“All the information we have puts the aircraft in this defined search area. Rough going ... GO Phoenix has since returned to Singapore after its contract with Malaysia ended. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \n“The enthusiasm and high morale (of the search crews) remains remarkable. We have a very impressive group of people working for us.” \nJust two vessels continue to scour the search zone throughout the harsh winter months, slowing progress considerably. \nGO Phoenix returned to Singapore at the start of June after the vessel’s contract with Malaysia ended, and Fugro Supporter withdrew in May when conditions became unsuitable for its sensitive equipment. Discovery ... An uncharted shipwreck was uncovered in the search for MH370. Picture: JACC/Australian Government Source: Supplied \nCommissioner Dolan said he hoped a third vessel would be able to join the operation later this year, when the weather improved. \n“The crews and equipment being used are excellent and the data we’re receiving is (of a quality) beyond the specifications yet,” he said. \n“If we have to search the entire area, it will be completed this time next year but we expect to find the aircraft before then.” \nFamilies of the 239 people on board MH370 continue to cling to the belief their loved ones are alive, hashtagging social media posts with “never lose hope”. \nThere were six Australians on the flight including two Brisbane couples, and a Sydney couple.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T17:20:27.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
