For me, it's all about small town Fourth of July parades, fireworks over the sea, and seafood boiling by the beach. \nYou'll find many coastal summer ideas on my Findery notemap, but here are nine tips on how to perfect a coastal family summer. Please note, I'm not even going to mention swimming and enjoying nature, because I hope everyone takes those as a given! \n1. Rent a beach house \nWhen I am on a tropical beach vacation, I want to stay in a nice luxury resort. When it comes to an East Coast vacation, my favorite thing to do is to rent a beach house. It's the best option for multi-generational travel if you're inviting the grandparents, or aunts, uncles, and cousins, to vacation with your family. Everyone can help defray the cost by pitching in. \nView from a rental beach house in Gloucester in Cape Ann, Massachusetts. Photo by Katja Presnal \n2. Eat local seafood \nI love fine dining as much anyone else, but what I love even more is enjoying fresh local seafood. We love to buy seafood directly from local fishermen, and when I can eat lobster at a beach side shack, I am a happy woman. Always ask the locals where they get their fresh seafood and where they recommend you eat! \nOne of the recommendations we got in Cape Ann was to eat at the Lobster Pool in Rockport . The best time to go is in the evening, during the golden hour just before the sunset. There's nothing fancy about this place; there are picnic tables are set outside by the sea and the food is served on paper plates on plastic trays. But that's how laid-back coastal lobster dinners are done, because good lobster is all you really need. \nLobster Pool restaurant in Rockport, Massachusetts. Photo by Katja Presnal \n3. Get on a boat \nA coastal vacation isn't perfected without having everyone get on a boat. I love being on boats, but my husband hates it. Every time we vacation on the coast, I try to talk him into taking a boat trip of some kind. Often it is a dinner cruise, and if available, a whale watching cruise . I think my expectations of a whale watching cruise is somewhat idyllic and inspired by Jacques Cousteau exploring the seas, but reality is very far from that. Would I still recommend it? Absolutely. Even if you only get fleeting glimpses of whales, it's still worth it. Spotting the coastal towns fly by along the shoreline, not to mention seeing the kids' happy faces, makes it a worthwhile adventure. Even despite the seasick husband. \nView of Gloucester in Cape Ann, Massachusetts. Photo by Katja Presnal \n4. Enjoy salt water taffy \nIf there is a candy to that represents a coastal summer vacation, it would have to be salt water taffy. There is just something literally sweet about walking to a taffy shop near the shore wearing a summer dress and sandals and filling a bag with pastel colored, paper wrapped candy that you can then take to the shore to enjoy while watching the ocean. \nOne perfect old-style salt water taffy shop can be found in Cape Ann. Tuck's Candies has been making salt water taffy in Rockport, MA, ever since 1929. \nTuck's Candy store in Rockport, MA. Photo by Katja Presnal \n5. Discover local art \nHow many have dreamed of living in a coastal town, and finally writing that novel, or painting all those paintings, because what could be a better muse than the ocean? I, for sure, have. There are many artists who have made this their reality, and I love supporting them by shopping at the art galleries in coastal towns. One great art town is Provincetown, on the tip of Cape Cod. The town features several art galleries and it makes for a great destination to shop for some coastal paintings to take home. Another favorite coastal art town is Rockport on the tip of Cape Ann. \nThanassi Gallery in Provincetown, MA. Photo by Katja Presnal \nDon't just want to bring home someone's art? You can find art classes in many coastal towns, and come back home with a newly acquired art skill. My kids recently took an art class on the Jersey Shore, at artBOX in Wildwood . \nartBOX art containers at Wildwood, New Jersey. Photo by Katja Presnal. \n6. Spend the evening on a boardwalk amusement park \nYou can't beat the retro-cheeky feel of Morey's Piers in New Jersey. When we were there, I felt like we had traveled back in time to experience retro All-American summer boardwalk fun. Many coastal amusement parks, like Morey's Piers in Wildwoods, New Jersey, come alive at dusk. Nothing beats the old-style carnival feel after the sun sets, and the bright lights of the hot dog stands, the carousels, and all of the rides really make the area contrast with the dark blue sky. I recommend watching the sunset on the Ferris wheel and letting yourself be dazzled by the amusement park lights right below you. \nMorey's Piers at dark in Wildwood, New Jersey.

If you do your research well you might be able to find lighthouses you can rent and stay in, or lighthouses that have been converted into bed & breakfasts. Don't miss an opportunity to see a lighthouse or two on your coastal trip! \nNote: this lighthouse is not in the USA, but it's Peggy's Cove in Nova Scotia, Canada. Photo by Katja Presnal. \n8. Eat ice cream \nCoastal vacations would be nothing without ice cream. I actually saw The Ice Cream Store in the Sandra Bullock movie \"Proposal,\" set in Alaska, years ago. It looked so beautiful, it fueled my desire to see Alaska in person. Luckily a friend of mine told me the movie was actually filmed in Rockport, MA, which is now my all-time favorite coastal town. Oh, yeah, the ice cream was good, too. \nThe Ice Cream Store in Rockport, MA. Photo by Katja Presnal. \n9. Visit a coastal city, like Boston \nEven when your goal is taking a relaxing beach vacation, you might want to dedicate at least one day to a coastal city trip. Whether you are on a coastal road trip, or flying to visit the beautiful coast of Massachusetts, I highly recommend saving time for a proper visit to Boston . Boston Harbor at the Long Wharf is a great place for boat watching, or stop for dinner at the Chart House in the marina, it has the best dinner options with great surroundings. In addition to the coastal fun in Boston, the city has so much more to offer. Faneuil Hall Marketplace is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the USA! \nBoston is actually a great destination to fly into for those flying from Europe. The flights are often cheaper than flying to other US destinations, and it makes a perfect city from which to start exploring America. \nBoston Marina.
