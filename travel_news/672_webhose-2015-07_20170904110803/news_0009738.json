But are you getting enough customer feedback and, importantly, are you handling it properly? Include user feedback as part of your strategy Kleanthis Georgaris, CEO of DigiServed , says: “Feedback can be the most valuable yet difficult asset to secure; so many companies simply don’t bother. \"Successful companies are those that include user feedback as part of their strategy; they have an established channel and process to communicate with their customers.” And for many, the process starts before launch. Richard Grant CEO of digital legacy app and web service lifetile , says: “From the very beginning of our journey we have encouraged a two-way dialogue with our user base. \"Initial feedback suggested that our first attempt was a bit clunky but we kept communicating, encouraging feedback and changing our offer accordingly. Use customer feedback to better understand the problems, not to reinforce what you want to hear or already believe \"We completely revamped our design and relaunched the site. The result is a far more beautiful product with a sleek user interface. So much of that is due to listening to our users.” Make talking to your users part of your weekly agenda Mr Georgaris says: “Data will reveal what has happened and highlight a problem, but cannot explain why the problem has occurred. \"Imagine you see a drop in website traffic; the data shows this but doesn’t explain why. It is only when you talk to your users that you learn that a competitor has undercut your price.” Ask the right questions Use customer feedback to better understand the problems, not to reinforce what you want to hear or already believe, says Mr Georgaris. “Don’t ask closed, yes-or-no questions such as, ‘Did you like the product?’” he says. “This will give limited results and not permit an insight into your customers’ psychology. Instead, ask, ‘What didn’t you like about the product?’ and ‘How could we improve it?’” However, Harrison Rose of Paddle counters this, saying: “Using the yes/no formula is an easy and effective way to gather quick feedback. Asking questions that are easy to answer improves your chances of actually getting a reply.” Collect feedback properly Kim Smith, head of customer care at Urban Massage , says: “We collect feedback via our mobile app. Our customers are time-poor and therefore providing a low-touch feedback mechanism is a non-intrusive method to monitor customer service and quality. Be careful of reaching out to customers aimlessly, as this will be detrimental to the overall customer experience \"In circumstances where service delivery does not meet your usual standards, a trigger should prompt an agent to personally reach out to the individual. Be careful of reaching out to customers aimlessly, as this will be detrimental to the overall customer experience.” Connect it all together Jade Bartholomew, of Climb Online, says: “The nature of an agency means that you can be in touch with your customers via a range of channels on a regular basis: project tracking tools, instant messaging services, phone calls, emails, face-to-face meetings and so on.” In these circumstances, a large part of good customer service success is being able to consolidate all of the disjointed conversations into a simple overview of expectations, progress and result reporting. “Customers want to know you are there for them when they need you, but they also want to be able to look back on the previous month and assess the value you added,” she adds.
