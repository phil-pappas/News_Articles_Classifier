The focus on Central Park comes in the wake of an effort last year to put an RV park in Castle Park, a push that triggered a grassroots citizen uprising that eventually led to the council voting against Castle Park as an RV park location. COST A cool $1.5 million is the price range of the proposed RV park before any potential local, state or federal grants are factored in. Stassen's goal is to get the cost below $1 million with grants, if possible, and to finance the total. \"We would look at financing for 20 years and possibly subsidize for three years,\" explained Stassen. \"Whatever we make, we can put away for maintenance.\" Page 2 of 2 - \"This could really revitalize our downtown area,\" he added. Stassen also mentioned that there's a possibility the Red Lake River Corridor Group – which includes Crookston and other communities along the river – may reconvene, and he said that putting forward one application for grant funding for the RV park through the group might help Crookston's chances of receiving funding.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T01:06:36.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
