The A350 XWB, is expected to arrive in Brazil in December of this year with the first commercial flight scheduled for January 2016 from São Paulo/Guarulhos to Manaus (AM). In March of 2016, the A350 XWB will commence international operations flying from Miami to São Paulo/Guarulhos and then from São Paulo/Guarulhos to Madrid in April 2016. \n“We chose São Paulo/Guarulhos to Manaus as the first route of the A350 XWB so the different areas of the company can get to know this new state-of-the-art long-range aircraft. Additionally, it is important for us to have an airplane of this size operating on this route, even in a temporary way, because it is one of Brazil and TAM Cargo’s main air cargo routes.”, says Ruy Amparo, Vice-President of Operations and Maintenance for TAM. The future pilots of the TAM A350 XWB will complete 60 days of in-flight and on the ground training to ensure that they are completely familiar with the aircraft. These pilots currently operate the TAM A330 fleet of aircraft and have been chosen to operate the future A350 fleet due the similarities (commonality) between Airbus products. These similarities will create efficiencies and reduce costs across operations, training and maintenance. “TAM has been preparing to incorporate this innovative aircraft to the fleet since 2012 by building a multidisciplinary team dedicated exclusively to the project”, said José Zaidan Maluf, Vice-President of Fleet and Engines for LATAM Airlines Group. “All areas of the company responsible for the operation of the A350 XWB ‒ including the technical and commercial crews and airport, operational and administrative teams ‒ are being trained to receive the new equipment”, added Maluf. New fleet TAM, part of LATAM Airlines Group, will be the first airline in the Americas and the fourth in the world to receive and operate an Airbus A350 XWB. The company has placed an order for 27 units of this model, with delivery is expected between late 2015 and 2019, and has another five purchase options. The arrival of this next generation aircraft to the Americas reinforces the Group’s commitment to maintaining one of the youngest and most modern fleets in the world, with more efficient aircraft with less environmental impact, and to use the best technology available in the aviation industry, to provide increased comfort for passengers. Built from state-of-the-art composite materials, which are lighter, more efficient and economical, the A350 XWB’s wider fuselage will enable an even more comfortable travel experience. TAM’s new aircraft model will be designed to serve different passenger profiles and will be have 348 seats total seats with 318 in Economy Class and 30 full-flat seats in Premium Business Class. With nine 18 inch-wide seats per row in Economy Class, customers will be able to enjoy more space, panoramic windows and more spacious luggage compartments for their carry-on luggage. Onboard the A350 XWB, passengers will enjoy an even more relaxing in-flight experience and feel less tired, even after longer flights. The air inside the cabin is refreshed every two or three minutes and maintained at an agreeable temperature. The Airbus A350 XWB also emits up to 25% less greenhouse gases than other planes used by the industry in long-range flights. The A350 XWB brings together the very latest in aerodynamics, design and advanced technologies, resulting in 25 percent lower operating cost (including fuel burn). More than 70 percent off the A350 XWB’s weight efficient airframe is made from advanced materials combining composites, titanium and advanced aluminum alloys, creating a lighter and more cost-efficient aircraft with materials that are also corrosion and fatigue free.
