The archipelago's government and China's Export-Import Bank, which provided a $2.4 billion loan for the project, requested the delay.\nBaha Mar said it was \"extremely concerned and disappointed\" by the Bahamas court decision and the government's objections after it successfully filed for U.S. Chapter 11 protection this week in Delaware. The developer wants the Bahamian high court to approve the U.S. court orders for a \"debtor-in-possession\" financing arrangement expected to provide the company with cash to pay for daily operations.\nThe adjournment has \"very troubling implications\" for the Chapter 11 process and efforts to complete construction and finally open the project after numerous delays, Baha Mar said.\n\"As we have made clear all week, time is of the essence for Baha Mar,\" it said.\nThe company said it is complying with a supreme court order to supply payroll information to allow the government to quickly pay the wages of more than 2,200 employees.\nThe megaresort in Nassau is touted as the most expensive project ever undertaken in the Bahamas. Some opposition leaders fear Baha Mar's woes could force the country back into recession.\nThe project was originally scheduled to open at the end of 2014. Baha Mar has repeatedly blamed incomplete work and missed deadlines on general contractor China Construction America.\nPlans call for a roughly 1,000-acre (405-hectare) complex with hotels, some 40 restaurants and clubs, an 18-hole golf course and what's billed as the Caribbean's biggest casino. Court papers say the project is about 97 per cent finished.\n___\nDavid McFadden on Twitter: http://twitter.com/dmcfadd\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T20:46:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
