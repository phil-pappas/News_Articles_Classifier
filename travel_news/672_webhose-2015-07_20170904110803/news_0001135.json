Despite the expert skiing on offer, lively après ski and luxurious surroundings it is also the lesser known areas and aspects of Verbier that will offer a new chapter to this festivals history. We look forward to meeting all the competitors in the autumn.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T11:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T11:45:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
