Whilst a challenge for Heathrow in terms of attracting airlines the news will strengthen the London airport’s case as it tries to persuade the British government to go along with the Airports Commission’s recommendations. \nMunich airport currently serves around 40 million passengers a year and expects this to rise to about 58m by 2025. \nThe complaint against a prior decision from a Munich court in 2014 was brought by a Bavarian environmental group, Bund Naturschutz, and five individuals. \nThe Leipzig-based federal court had already rejected a similar complaint brought by local municipalities in February. It said last Wednesday the Munich court decision was now fully binding and the airport had the right to build the runway. \nObstacles remain and it is likely that those opposed to the expansion will attempt to go to a higher court.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T03:27:36.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
