Whether it’s a bucket and spade, a cruise, or an adventure that awaits you this summer, these books will keep your family entertained. For the youngest readers 1. Where Oh Where is Rosie’s Chick? by Pat Hutchins (Hodder, £11.99) Fifty years after her classic Rosie’s Walk, Pat Hutchins has resurrected Rosie, who in this delightful, strikingly illustrated adventure for 2-4 year olds has lost her chick. Can you help her find it? As she stalks around looking for it, the chick itself is clumsily getting into – and out of – the sorts of scrapes that children find very funny. 2. The Snail and the Whale , by Julia Donaldson, (Macmillan, £6.99) The Snail and the Whale, by Julia Donaldson Julia Donaldson needs no introduction, and over the years has given us some wonderful titles, but none more so than The Snail and the Whale, perfectly illustrated by Axel Scheffler, in which a snail with wanderlust boards the back of a whale, off to see the world. Told in rhyme this is a tale about travel and friendship with some thrilling adventures along the way. Unmissable. 3. Blown Away , by Rob Biddulph (HarperCollins, £6.99) \"A windy day, a brand new kite, for Penguin blue, a maiden flight\". So begins this charming study of the best paid plans going wrong, as Penguin – and all of his \"helpful\" friends – are blown to a desert island and they must figure out how to get back to chillier climes. Charming details will catch parents’ eyes just as much as a child’s. 4. The Moomins and the Great Flood , by Tove Jansson (Sort of Books, £9.99) The Moomins are a perennial favourite, and any of Tove Jansson’s many might serve as an introduction, but this one – her very first, published in 1945 - involves rain, which, let’s face it, might very well fall on holiday more or less wherever you are, and learning how plucky little Moomin deals with its frustrations may well pass a helpful hour or two. A film version of Tove Jansson's creation was released this spring The Moomins on the Riviera: review Primary 5. Attack of the Giant Sea Spiders, by Gareth P Jones (Stripes, £5.99) Book two in another winning mash-up of favourite things from Gareth P Jones – who also wrote Ninja Meerkats and the Dragon Detective Agency – sees the pirates caught between their nemesis Dread Captain Inky Beard and the rampaging spider. Utterly daft but really funny. Is it worth taking my child to KidZania? Family fun: our guide to family holidays 6. The Promised One , by David Alric (Acme, £6.99) On her way to school one morning, Lucy is hit by a stolen BMW, and wakes up in hospital able to understand and speak to animals. She is the Promised One, for whom they have been waiting a million years, and she is very much needed. So starts a thrilling adventure that takes her to the jungles of South America. This is the first in a series, packed with knowledge enthusiastically communicated, and a must for any animal-loving child. 7. The Letter for the King , by Tonke Dragt (Pushkin, £7.99) When a trainee knight is given a mission carrying the eponymous letter, he kicks off a classic fantasy set in a medieval world, beautifully translated from the original Dutch, that combines a comfortingly old-fashioned picaresque adventure with a surprisingly modern tale about growing up, taking responsibility and looking beyond the obvious. Children aren't reading enough books and dads are to blame Reading with children 'improves their exam results' 8. Cosmic , by Frank Cottrell Boyce, (MacMillan, £6.99) Frank Cottrell Boyce is a genius, and this very funny, very touching story involves Liam, a freakishly tall boy, posing as an adult to win a competition to go to space with a girl he likes, who in her turn has to pretend to be his daughter. Inevitably things do not go according to plan, and Liam has to adapt to survive not so much in space, but among his fellow humans. Young Adult 9. Holes, by Louis Sachar (Bloomsbury, £6.99) Holes, by Louis Sachar, won the 1999 Newbery Medal for the year's 'most distinguished contribution to American literature for children' Already an established classic and only 15 years old, Holes is about keeping hope, and finding good things in bad spots. Set in the USA, it is about boy to a juvenile detention centre somewhere in the desert for a crime he did not do, where he must dig a hole and fill it in everyday. He never gives up hope of escaping and getting to Big Thumb Mountain, where salvation awaits. Slyly witty, sometimes harsh, always truthful, Holes is unforgettable. 10. Cleo , by Lucy Coates, (Orchard, £7.99) Not much is known about Cleopatra other than her various run ins with the Romans, but Lucy Coates – author of the brilliant Atticus the Storyteller – turns her attention from ancient Greek myths to her girlhood and recreates it in all its – to us – many bizarre aspects. Cleo is not what you would call long-suffering, but she has much to complain of, not least the murder of her mother. 11. Finding Audrey, by Sophie Kinsella (Doubleday, £12.99) Sophie Kinsella is better known for her Shopaholic brand of novels, but don’t be put off: this is a sympathetic and sensitive treatment of a teenage girl overcoming chronic anxiety brought on by an incident at school. Her family are brilliantly drawn and her relationship with her brother’s friend Linus extremely touching, but it is the message of hope that resounds. 12. Running Girl , by Simon Mason (David Fickling, £7.99) A detective book with a difference and a terrific lead: Garvie Smith, implausibly intelligent, implausibly attractive, but plausibly lazy for whom life holds no surprises until one day his ex-girlfriend’s body is pulled from a pond and Garvie decides he had better get himself organised. His relationship with the very straight D.I. Singh is brilliantly done – moving from reluctance to reliance – and this is the beginning of a really smart and funny relationship. Toby Clements is a book reviewer, author and father of three.
