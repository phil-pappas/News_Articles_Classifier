To say nothing of hugely stressful. But United Airlines (NYSE: UAL) is definitely aiming for a touch of chic with the debut on Aug. 1 of a new set of amenity kits for its premium cabin passengers on international flights. The centerpiece of the new United kits, which come in shades of brown, is a selection of Cowshed skin-care products from London-based Soho House & Co., which operates a small chain of — yes — chic membership-only clubs, including the Soho House that opened in Chicago's West Loop neighborhood last summer. Soho House Chicago was named to Conde Nast Traveler magazine's 2015 list of the hottest hotels. Founded in London in 1995, Soho House reportedly restricts membership in its clubs to those who are artists or who have have a job in a creative business. The United Kingdom edition of Cosmopolitan magazine called the Cowshed product line a \"super-stylish beauty brand.\" All Cowshed products are made in England from organic plant extracts and essential oils. Included in the new United amenity kits are a Cowshed lip balm, a chamomile towelette and hand cream. Additionally United's new global first class kits will include a Cowshed eye balm and a face moisturizer. Tom O'Toole , Chicago-based United's chief marketing officer, hailed the new amenity kit as \"another step in enhancing our customers' experience in flight and on the ground.\" Thanks Tom. \nWant Chicago Retailing & Restaurants news in your inbox?
