The tournament is taking place in Espinho, Portugal.\nThe Ticos are fighting for their second Beach World Cup after failing to get past the group stage in the 2009 tournament in Dubai. The beach sele is the current CONCACAF champion.\nGabriele Gori put the Italian team ahead just 30 seconds into play. Greivin Pacheco evened up the game at minute 6, giving hope to the Tico team. But that hope promptly evaporated.\nAnother goal by Gori a few minutes later put the Italian team ahead again, and the win was sealed by back-to-back goals by Emmanuelle Zurlo, another by Gori and a sixth by Italian player Andrés Villegas.\nOn Saturday, Costa Rica will try to climb back into the competition when it faces Switzerland. Meanwhile, Italy could seal its advance when it faces Oman.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zl-ZJxWNT6A?feature=oembed"], "published": "2015-07-10T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T20:04:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
