Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. Persons developing these symptoms should seek medical attention. There have been two reports of illness associated with a single distributor in Minnesota. \nThe frozen tuna was sold in bulk packaging to distributors who further sold it to sushi restaurants, and grocery stores who packaged sushi rolls made available for consumers to purchase and take home, throughout the U.S. from 05/09/14 to 07/09/15 containing all sequential four digit Purchase Order Numbers (PO#) of 8563 through 8599. \nThe bulk frozen tuna products can be identified from the Purchase Order Number (PO#) printed on each product carton box end panel; see embedded image. \nConsumers concerned about whether the sushi they purchased may contain the recalled tuna product should check with the restaurant or store where they purchased the sushi. That store will be able to determine if it used the recalled product to prepare the sushi. At this time Osamu does not believe that the recalled product or sushi made with the recalled product is available for purchase by consumers. \nCustomers who have purchased the frozen tuna products from their distributors are urged to return it to the distributor for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact the company at 1-310-849-8881, Mondays through Fridays, 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. (PDT).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T21:56:09.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
