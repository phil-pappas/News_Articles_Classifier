The outdoor accommodation provider is already one of the most established providers of camping and glamping holidays in the UK but of late the company has noticed a lean towards corporate bookings. . \nCommenting on the situation founder Dan Yates said: \"Corporate bookings are new for us but its a trend I'm keen to grow. So many of our sites offer large accommodation, activities or the ability to take over a whole area with tents and tourers. This is ideal for the corporate and incentive market. In the past month we've had two large corporate bookings and further enquiries. Increasingly PAs are turning to consumer sites like ours to book team building breaks. The affordability of camping enables team building to continue in a toughened financial market. The usability of websites like ours enables bookers to simply search for their relevant needs without the need for a convoluted booking process. Furthermore we've noticed the requests are more focused towards traditional needs such as sites that offer activities and open fires. As with normal holiday bookings, corporate bookings are following the trend of being mainly for tent pitches, rather than glamping.\" He continues: \"On the other side of corporate bookings we've spotted an increase in the use of caravan parks by contractors, especially by steelworkers in the Aberdeen area who book long stays in caravan parks. The lower cost of a hire of a static caravan compared to hotels appears to be what has driven this type of corporate booking. Given that many of our large caravan sites offer clubhouses which could be used for events and meetings, perhaps this is the dawn of a new era of corporate travel.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T19:03:57.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
