The spot is conveniently located on a quiet, tucked-away cobblestone street in the center of Vienna. While the real showstoppers at Neko are the Maine Coons—shaggy cats that can grow up to twenty-five pounds—there are also a handful of smaller fur balls that roam around, all rescued from local animal shelters. For visitors in need of refueling, the spot also offers a selection of tasty homemade pastries, hot teas and coffees, fresh juices, and free Wi-Fi. \nPlan Your Trip: Visit Fodor’s Vienna Travel Guide Photo Credit: Courtesy of Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium \nWhere: London, England \nThrough a successful Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign, London’s very first cat cafe is now a must-visit attraction in the hip Shoreditch neighborhood of East London. And in true English form, Lady Dinah’s Cat Emporium boasts two types of 90-minute bookings—one for afternoon tea, the other for traditional high tea—all while a total of twelve cats freely roam around the two floors of the cafe. An entrance fee of £6 (which is used to help raise the furry residents) gets you into this kitten haven. It’s advised to make a reservation in advance. \nPlan Your Trip: Visit Fodor’s London Travel Guide Photo Credit: Courtesy of La Gatoteca La Gatoteca \nWhere: Madrid, Spain \nIf the adoptable fur balls of La Gatoteca don’t immediately put you at ease, the homey interior certainly will. This cafe, which is set up like a living room—complete with bookshelves, plushy couches, and cat artwork on the walls—is a must-visit spot for Madrid tourists in need of unwinding after perusing the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía next door (the country’s go-to spot for twentieth-century art). Admission into La Gatoteca is a few euros for an hour, and that ticket also includes a free drink. \nPlan Your Trip: Visit Fodor’s Madrid Travel Guide Photo Credit: Courtesy of Neko no Jikan Neko no Jikan \nWhere: Osaka, Japan \nConsidering the nation’s heavy hand in catapulting cat cafes to global popularity, it’s only appropriate that our list includes a Japanese spot. In fact, Neko no Jikan claims to be Japan’s very first cat cafe. Though this particular spot, in the entertainment district of Osaka, is pricier than most (the establishment even charges for use of its toys), visiting one of the original cat cafes is an unmatched experience. Plus, with up to twenty felines roaming around, it’s guaranteed that every cat lover will leave satisfied.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T12:29:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
