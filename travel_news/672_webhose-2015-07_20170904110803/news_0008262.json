Beginning as soon as this week, passengers who have achieved elite or “medallion” status in Delta’s SkyMiles frequent-flier program will be eligible for the upgrade offers. But officials stress that the initial number of private jet flights will be small and focused mainly at Delta’s East Coast hubs. \n“This is truly a groundbreaking new approach from both industry standpoints,” said James Murray, vice president of operations at Delta Private Jets. \nDelta’s decision to merge some of its commercial traffic with its 66-aircraft private jet unit shows the airline’s relentless focus on finding new revenue or squeezing more from existing customers. \nCorporate travelers, who are less price-conscious because they book travel on their company’s credit card, represent the most-attractive business for most large network carriers. The move reflects the airline industry’s keen focus on differentiating air travel and showering their most-profitable customers with ever-higher levels of perks. \nThe upgrades also could help Delta quell one of the thorniest-and costliest-problems in private aviation, known as “empty legs,” or the need to reposition a jet without having a customer headed to that particular location. These inefficient flights account for roughly a third of all private jet flights, despite industry efforts to minimize them. \nInitially, only Delta’s top customers — those at the highest “Diamond Medallion” level, which is met when people spend $15,000 at Delta and travel at least 125,000 miles or 140 flight segments per year — were going to be invited to purchase the upgrades. \nBut the company has spent months tweaking its model and decided to expand the pool of potential customers by opening it to people at the lowest elite tier, those who travel 25,000 miles or 30 segments annually, and who spend $3,000. \nMost of the upgrades will involve travel scheduled the next day, although Delta Private Jets said it would have some flights that offer travelers as much as 48 hours’ notice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T08:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T08:19:40.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
