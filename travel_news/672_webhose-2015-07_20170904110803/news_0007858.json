I'm very optimistic about the future, so I think we will use those rooms.\" \nThe Holiday Inn Downtown Convention Center and the Bentley, both of which are connected to the Alexandria Riverfront Center, are counting on convention business coming back to Alexandria. The city used to do a good business in medium-sized state and regional conventions, but much of that dried up when the Bentley closed and the Fulton deteriorated. \nA resurgence in convention business would not only create a market for the 96-room Bentley and the Holiday Inn Downtown Convention Center, Sharplin said the effects would spill over to benefit other hotel properties. \nIn addition to convention business, other factors that could fill the area's added hotel capacity and drive further demand in the future include continuing to attract more sports tournaments, bigger events at a renovated Rapides Parish Coliseum and planned manufacturing facilities, most notably a 1,500-job aluminum facility in Pineville. \n\"If the convention business comes and if these plants that have been announced are fully developed, we'll get some more hotels,\" said longtime local developer Rod Noles. \nInformation from: Alexandria Daily Town Talk, http://www.thetowntalk.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T08:52:38.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
