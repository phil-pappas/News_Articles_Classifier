Both properties will compete in a field of five and have been nominated from a list of more than 1000.\n“Words cannot express how thrilled we are to be a nominee for Virtuoso Best of The Best 2015, we feel incredibly blessed and honoured,” Gaia Retreat & Spa Directors, Olivia Newton-John & Gregg Cave said.\n“It is a true testimony to our wonderful team who come to work with heart, giving our guests the distinction of tailored personalised attention.”\nExecutive Director Delaware North Parks & Resorts Australia, Greg Magi, was equally delighted to have their newly refurbished Lizard Island recognised as ‘One to Watch’ amongst the worlds best resorts.\n“We are thrilled that Lizard Island has been shortlisted as one of the world’s top luxury destinations. It recognises there truly is nowhere else like it, and confirms it is a key property to watch this year,” Mr Magi said.\n“Following a $50million renovation and refurbishment, Lizard Island is delighted to welcome guests from all over the world. We are confident Lizard Island’s new Saltwater Restaurant, Driftwood Bar and Wine Cellar, and fully refurbished suites will delight both new and returning visitors to the island.”\nMr Londregan will join representatives from the two nominated resorts, along with more than 80 other Australian products and luxury travel advisors at the annual Virtuoso Travel Week event which will be held in Las Vegas’ Bellagio Resort and Casino in August.\n“Virtuoso Travel Week is a truly amazing event that brings together the best of the high end in luxury travel from across the globe for a number of industry forums including more than 400,000 face-to-face meetings, inspiring destination showcases and the final night’s Hotels & Resorts Dinner where the Best of the Best winners will be announced.”\nThe 27th annual Virtuoso Travel Week will take place from 8-13 August and brings together thousands of member travel advisors who are industry leaders in creating luxury travel experiences, and the world’s best travel providers.\nRelated Posts Jason Pomeranc, hotelier announces launch of new brand of hotel Sixty Hotels Lisa Lewis Joins Associated Luxury Hotels As National Sales Manager In The U.S. West Region Celebrate the holiday season at Moon Dance Cliffs Hotel & Spa Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium Dubai Airport Terminal 1 await bids from retailers!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T16:50:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
