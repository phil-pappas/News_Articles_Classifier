It bears testimony to the rapid industrialization of the country from the middle of the 19th century to the early 20th century, through the development of the steel industry, shipbuilding and coal mining.\nEpheus in Turkey is located within what was once the estuary of the River Kaystros, Ephesus comprises successive Hellenistic and Roman settlements founded on new locations, which followed the coastline as it retreated westward.\nExcavations have revealed grand monuments of the Roman Imperial period including the Library of Celsus and the Great Theatre.\nLittle remains of the famous Temple of Artemis, one of the “Seven Wonders of the World,” which drew pilgrims from all around the Mediterranean.\nSince the 5th century, the House of the Virgin Mary, a domed cruciform chapel seven kilometers from Ephesus, became a major place of Christian pilgrimage.\nThe Ancient City of Ephesus is an outstanding example of a Roman port city, with sea channel and harbor basin.\nThe 16th century aqueduct of Padre Tembleque Hydralic System in aqueduct is located between the states of Mexico and Hidalgo, on the Central Mexican Plateau. This heritage canal system encompasses a water catchment area, springs, canals, distribution tanks and arcaded aqueduct bridges.\nThe site incorporates the highest single-level arcade ever built in an aqueduct.\nInitiated by the Franciscan friar, Padre Tembleque, and built with support from the local indigenous communities, this hydraulic system is an example of the exchange of influences between the European tradition of Roman hydraulics and traditional Mesoamerican construction techniques, including the use of adobe.\nRelated Posts Global Coalition “Unite for Heritage” launched in Bonn by UNESCO Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building Yemen’s Old City of Sana’a and Old Walled City of Shibam added to List of World Heritage in Danger ‘Earn While you Learn’ Programme – India TripAdvisor touches mark of 100 million downloads for free app for iPhone and Android", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T23:39:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
