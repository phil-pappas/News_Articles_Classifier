Paul Rush \nHannah is the first woman to be accepted as a trainee rider in 436 years \n\"It's a masculine environment and I found it hard to fit in at first but people are treating me with respect,\" she explains. \nThere has never been an official ban on women, but for 436 years, the famous white Lipizzaner stallions were trained and ridden by men. Then in 2008, two women passed the entrance exam. \nHannah rides a six-year-old, up-and-coming star of the school who is being trained in the three basic gaits. Each lesson is executed in an elaborate sequence in time to music, but occasionally the young horse steps out of line. Supplied \nEvery care and attention is given to the precious Lipizzaner horses. \n\"My challenge is to get my horse to trot higher,\" Hannah says. \"In the passage, also called the Spanish trot, each pair of legs is suspended in the air higher and longer than for a normal trot. I've also tried the difficult Capriole â€“ but we will need much more practice before attempting such difficult movements.\" \nThe main weekly performance of the Spanish Riding School is at 11am on Sundays but I'm attending the week-day training session in the baroque ambiance of the Imperial Palace. I'm told it's a 'must-see' show in Vienna, the home of Strauss, palaces, coffeehouses, chocolate sachertorte and white stallions. \nI step back in amazement as I enter the main arena. Expecting an oversized barn-like interior as the performance venue, I cannot believe how elaborate this building is. My immediate impression is that the Lipizzaners do their dance routines in the world's most beautiful ballroom. \nThis may not be far from the truth as this great hall has a decorative domed roof, immense chandeliers, Corinthian columns, elaborate embossed motifs, a royal box and great portrait of Emperor Charles VI who commissioned the building in 1572. It is not only a spectacular location for dressage but served as Maria Theresa's main venue for masked balls and ladies' carousels during the heady days of the Hapsburg Empire. Ad Feedback \nToday the great hall is suffused with a purple glow from recessed lights that cast weird shadows across the whitewashed walls in the form of distorted chandelier shapes. The audience is hushed in the semi-darkness as faint strains of Strauss music fill the arena. The collective feeling of anticipation is palpable. \nAll eyes focus on the left entry door as three magnificent white stallions walk out onto the sand with graceful, coordinated strides in time with the rhythm of the music. The riders walk behind, guiding their horse with long reins and a light touch of the whip. Each animal moves purposefully around the perimeter wall showing intelligence and sensitivity in the way they respond instantly to pressure on the reins. \nA perfectly coordinated quadrille is a breathtaking sight. \nI'm amazed how light-footed and graceful the stallions are. Rounding the far end of the arena, they appear to be floating on air but as the first horse comes nearer; my mind conjures up an entirely different image. Powerful muscles ripple and strain as he turns directly in front of me. In a flash I imagine being a foot soldier in the Napoleonic Wars facing a mass cavalry charge of great war horses. It's a terrifying scenario. \nMy thoughts turn back to the grace and symmetry of this performance, which continues for a dozen circuits before mounted riders enter, crossing the arena in diagonal passes, stopping briefly to display the levade. The horse raises his forelegs, shifts his full weight to the hindquarters and holds this position for several seconds, showing amazing self control. \nThe first climax comes as one rider signals his mount with an unseen touch to spring from one diagonal pair of legs to the other, prancing energetically as it moves forward in a passage. The manoeuvre is a triumph of balance and coordination. Soon this feat is excelled by one rider persuading his mount to lower the hind quarters, raise his body and do a series of forward moving jumps in a courbette. \nThese classic routines are astounding feats of control but the young Lipizzaner stallions haven't produced their best yet. A senior rider glides to the centre of the arena at the trot and directs his mount to leap with all four legs in the air, kicking out with his hind legs while his forelegs are tucked under in an unbelievable manoeuvre called capriole. \nPrecise control is evident in the long rein arena work. \nWhen the show ends we file out into a rectangular courtyard in the large stable complex. Aristocratic white equine heads appear at a number of half stable doors with ears erect and eyes taking in all the curious antics of the human visitors. \nSenior Rider, Herwig Radnetter, introduces me to his fine 15.2 hand stallion Teberia, one of his six charges. \"This horse is a direct descendent of the Austrian imperial stud from 1580 and our archives record all the classic bloodlines from that period. The best four-year-old stallions are selected for a five-year training course at the school.\" I learn that white horses were originally chosen so as not to compete with the colourful medieval costumes of the aristocracy. \nThe courbette involves a series of forward jumps on hind legs. \nI'm surprised how affectionate Teberia is, especially when Herwig gives him a sugar cube. As groups of visitors gather by his stall and pose for photos he becomes positively amorous. When I approach the horse expecting similar treatment, I receive a short, sharp nudge with his moist muzzle in the back of my head. Herwig gives him another sugar cube and tells me not to be offended as the big boy tends to favour the ladies with his TLC. \"Sometimes I give him sugar but other times he gets a slap on the face if he's naughty,\" he says. When he reaches 25, Teberia will have a well-deserved retirement in the country. \nFor lovers of dressage the Spanish Riding School performance is a dream come true. Others will appreciate the sheer beauty and symmetry as a classical tradition of medieval Europe. The magnificent snow-white, high-stepping, prancing, preening stallions are an unforgettable sight. \nNZ Horse & Pony magazine available at all good retailers. \nGETTING THERE \nThe Spanish Riding School is located in Michaelerplatz near Vienna's Hofburg Palace.
