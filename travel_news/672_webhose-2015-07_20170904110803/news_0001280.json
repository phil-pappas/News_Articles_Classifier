Suddenly bling is the thing and rustic landscapes start giving way to faux chateaus, liveried estates and cellar doors that rival the Bilbao Guggenheim.\nThe Margaret River region is both rich and famous. Bountiful and beautiful, it has successively prospered on timber, cattle and more recently wine. It’s also three hours south of Perth and a favourite of Western Australia’s mining magnates who want second homes overlooking the Indian Ocean.\nSo with this in mind, I think I have the perfect car with which to tour the region …\nOn the outside the new 2015 Audi TT is sleek enough to keep up with the Forrests, but on the inside the technology puts it way in front. The boffins at Audi have ripped out traditional console dials and replaced them with a “virtual cockpit”, a computer screen which, upon request, will shove speedo and rev counter out of the way to focus squarely on GPS navigation. Push a button to engage “Active Lane Assist” and the car senses the white lines of the road and is ready to steer itself back on track if I’m distracted by the scenery.\nWith a car that practically drives itself and an exhaust note to die for, I feel all heads will be turned my way. But I soon learn appearances can be deceptive.\nRelaxation ... inside the Pullman Resort, Bunker Bay. Picture: Daniel Grant Source: Supplied\nThe monster dunes of Cape Naturaliste are home to the Pullman Resort Bunker Bay. This substantial luxury retreat has an infinity pool, restaurant and stylish villas built of rock, topped with roofs curved like waves. But it’s actually a low-key affair. In fact, when I take my dawn coffee down onto the vast curl of white sand, the resort completely disappears behind huge dunes. It’s just me, a dawn and a couple of fishermen lazily working the glassy shallows.\nAnd this is precisely how Margaret River likes it. Modest. Natural. And discreet.\nGabriel Myburgh gave up being a lawyer to hand-make gourmet chocolate because “chocolate makes people happy”. His bean-to-bar range certainly did that: this year, nine Gabriel Chocolate bars swept the Sydney Royal Easter Show.\nSkincare range ... Vasse Virgin at the Margaret River in WA. Picture: Daniel Grant Source: Supplied\nHeath Townsend, chef of WISE restaurant, has won the AMEX Best Vineyard Restaurant, but he’s happier talking about surf breaks, and even happier to show off a colossal 15kg dhufish he’s just bought from a fisherman.\nAnd there’s Louis Scherini who began making his Vasse Virgin premium skincare products from pure olive oil to help his daughters’ eczema. It worked. Too well, perhaps – his operation, a classic and fragrant example of “shed chic”, has attracted the ire of Richard Branson’s mighty Virgin group, threatening action because the two brands may be confused.\nRich soils and cooling ocean breezes established the famous wine industry but it, too, is modest, producing just 4 per cent of Australia’s wine by volume.\nA good drop ... Cullen Winery at the Margaret River, WA. Picture: Daniel Grant Source: Supplied\nThe first vineyard was planted in 1967 by Dr Tom Cullity, although it wasn’t exactly a success. When his grape crop was pillaged by silvereye birds, Dr Tom trained up a peregrine falcon and released the raptor to patrol the next year’s crop. The bird immediately flew away never to be seen again – except, on the Vasse Felix label, a logo that has cheerfully flown around the world’s premium cellars. Today, it’s one of Margaret River’s largest producers (and now owned by the Holmes a Court family), yet crushes a distinctly boutique 200,000 tonnes a year.\nThe crush at nearby Cullen Winery is even smaller. Cullen practises the 1930s spiritual science of biodynamics, rejecting chemical fertilisers and pesticides and other 21st-century evils of consumerist convenience.\nCullen’s resident agriculturalist Jaimie Orkin packs manure into cow horns and buries them under a full moon to harness energies and create safer organics with which to fertilise the vines. It all sounds like poop to me, but it’s hard to argue with the Diana Madeline 2012 Cab Sav, which won 98 points off James Halliday.\nIndeed, look beneath the bushel and you see the light: Margaret River may produce only 4 per cent of Australia’s wine by volume, but a full 26 per cent of the nation’s premium wines come from these vineyards.\nAfter long autumn days driving between dairy pasture, vegetable fields and vineyards, the sum of Margaret River’s parts is greatest when served up in the local cafes and restaurants. It’s where you wonder if this is a region that really does have everything.\nNew heights ... the Cape Naturaliste Lighthouse. Picture: Daniel Grant Source: Supplied\nAt Lamont’s on Smiths Beach, chef Jim Mailes brings out a marron to show off the gorgeous local freshwater cray. It’s glossy and black – and just a little too lively for some, who take pity and change their order.\nPerhaps the simplest pleasure is watching the sun setting into the Indian Ocean.\nI’m treated to the spectacle standing atop the Cape Naturaliste lighthouse, just when the 1903 lamp – 4.5 tonnes of glass – is about to begin turning on its bed of mercury and toss light through the velvety dusk.\nI find myself absorbed by the epic horizons and the romance of a lighthouse offering safe passage for another night. And for all its cleverness and sleek lines, I barely give the Audi TT another thought.\nThe truth is you really don’t need a future-minded sports car to enhance your enjoyment of a region as stunning as Margaret River. But just like an Audi packed with state-of-the-art technology, it doesn’t go astray.\n- Max Anderson was a guest of Audi, Tourism Western Australia and Qantas\nGO2\nMargaret River\nGetting there\nQantas flies from all major cities to Perth; the region is a three-hour drive south.\nStaying there\nVillas at Pullman Resort Bunker Bay cost from $240 twin share a night.\nMore\nwesternaustralia.com", "external_links": ["http://www.westernaustralia.com/au/Pages/Welcome_to_Western_Australia.aspx", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227435/531896-241867ac-0280-11e5-9cd4-3a82df739478.jpg", "http://www.pullmanhotels.com/gb/hotel-8775-pullman-bunker-bay-resort-margaret-river-region/index.shtml", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227435/533341-18ca6878-0280-11e5-9cd4-3a82df739478.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227435/531922-068a12b2-0280-11e5-9cd4-3a82df739478.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227435/533289-d1836028-027f-11e5-9cd4-3a82df739478.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-10T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T17:50:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
