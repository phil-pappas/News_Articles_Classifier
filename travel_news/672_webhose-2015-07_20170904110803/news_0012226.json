Suspicions were aroused when Vladimir Ivanov, 35, acted strangely in front of the coin pushing machine and police were called. Security detained him until officers arrived and discovered a large magnet in Ivanov's possession - and he was unable to explain why he had it. But he was convicted of going equipped for theft at one of Britain's most popular amusement arcades on Brighton Pier, East Sussex. Magistrates in Brighton ordered for the magnet to be destroyed and Ivanov, speaking through a Russian translator, admitted the charge which saw him fined £110 - and facing costs of £235.

John Whittaker, of Whittaker Bros who are leading manufacturer in coin operated amusement machines, said it would be almost impossible to extract coins using a magnet. He said: \"I have not heard of that happening before. \"I would have thought you would need such a strong magnet because you are so far away from the coins anyway, unless they are dropping a string with a magnet on down through the coin slots or something like that. \"Obviously people do fish with bits of string with various things on, but there are measures to stop that. \"There is also a mechanical switch which has to operate [to let the coins through] - so I don't think it would be easy at all.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T08:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T04:21:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
