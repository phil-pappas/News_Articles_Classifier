By Valentina Mariani \nWith statement chandeliers, a golden subterranean room and plenty of sophisticated touches alongside a mix of heady cocktails and a creative menu, the happenstance has made its mark on the Square Mile. \nOverlooking London’s most iconic landmark, the happenstance encompasses a striking bar, deli with mixology table and florist, open-plan dining area and opulent private dining room, ‘The Curious Treasury’, making it the perfect choice for early morning meetings, leisurely lunches, after-work cocktails or late-night suppers. From beautiful breakfasts and boozy brunches through to power lunches and dinner dates, the happenstance is open all day. Early birds catch the worm with freshly-brewed coffee, just-pulped juices and fresh-out-the-oven pastries to-go; while those looking for something a little more sit-down can enjoy the likes of blueberry pancakes with maple syrup, eggs benedict and a classic cooked breakfast all with complimentary WiFi and stacks of newspapers. \nLunchtimes can be as quick or as languid as you like: small plates, sharing boards, seasonal salads, beautiful burgers and doorstop sandwiches are great for in-and-out lunch hours while bigger plates – served from lunch to late – range from pea and lemon risotto with mascarpone, fish pie with a cheddar potato crust or baby chicken, gremolata and avocado salad. Those with sweet teeth can finish with a summer pudding with clotted cream, salted caramel and plum sundae with honeycomb or Eton mess with strawberries. \nSo, whether you’re after a cheeky lunchtime pit-stop, post-work mingling or relaxed evening meal, the happenstance is sure to be a welcome addition to your little black book. \nNo.1A Ludgate Hill,", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T17:26:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
