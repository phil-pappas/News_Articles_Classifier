They will display travel times when not showing messages about crashes or road conditions. \nThe new boards will supplement 26 dedicated travel-time signs in Indiana's larger metropolitan areas. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T13:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T15:29:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
