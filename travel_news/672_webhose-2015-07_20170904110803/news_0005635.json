This unique offering is practical for the hotels and has the added benefit of forging a more intimate relationship with the consumers, who will likely enjoy the opportunity to participate in the behind-the-scenes initiative. \nQuality assurance Most luxury hotels rely on official hotel inspectors to provide information about the quality of the experience. For this program, however, Small Luxury Hotels of the World will put real quests in this role, asking them secretly collect data and report back to SLH after their trip. \nMystery Inspectors will report on the quality of facilities and service \nMystery Inspectors will report on the quality of their experience at a hotel from start to finish, examining a variety of factorings ranging from the facilities to the service. They will also report on any events or special offerings such as a trip to the spa or restaurant. \nMystery Inspectors will work undercover, incorporating their inspections into their own travel plans. Whether they are staying at an SLH for business, exploration or a family vacation, they will report back to SLH after their trip is completed. \nThis manor is Ireland is one of many locations around the world \nAs compensation for their work, SLH will refund Mystery Inspectors one night’s accommodation. Essentially, the program will work as a loyalty program, rewarding guests who put in extra effort to review the hotels. \nUltimately, the Mystery Inspectors program in beneficial to SLH in multiple ways. It will provide reviews that will help future guests learn more about the hotels, while also allowing current guests to connect more intimately with the brand and form a lasting relationship. \nMystery Inspectors will review activities such as kayaking in Malaysia \nGroup effort The Mystery Inspector program will likely be successful as reviews are an important component for hotels looking to appeal to guests. \nWhen luxury consumers are deciding where to stay as they travel, reviews posted online have more influence than similar appraisals delivered in magazines, newspapers or television, according to a report from Unity Marketing. \nSimilarly, advertisements for travel experiences that run in print or on television make less impact than reviews. Since online reviews from other customers pull more weight than even word of mouth from friends and family, hospitality brands need to find ways to give their guests a voice online ( see story ). \nWorking with consumers if often a good way for brands to form connections while simultaneous collecting information about their efforts. For example, British retailer Fortnum & Mason asked its network of ambassadors for feedback on a number of initiatives. \nIn December of 2014, Fortnum & Mason asked for consumers’ insights when the retailer was testing the beta version of its updated Web site to ensure the best ecommerce experience. When consumers offered their feedback on the beta site they became “feedback ambassadors,” and the provided insights would shape the new Web presence while in return the participants would exclusive previews and news ( see story ). \nFinal Take Kay Sorin, editorial assistant on Luxury Daily, New York", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T10:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T10:35:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
