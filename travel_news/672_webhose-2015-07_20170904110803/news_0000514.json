And whenever you see anyone out there who is following the basic pattern of disruption – take something hard and simplify it; take something expensive and make it cheaper – you stand up and take notice. You watch these things carefully, you put yourself in uncomfortable situations.” Silicon Valley, home to many of the world’s largest hi-tech corporations as well as thousands of tech start-up companies, is one place where you can find spaceship-loads of these aliens. The California hub, where Google, Facebook and Apple have their headquarters, is a hotbed of progressive and free-thinking folk. While machines will have a big say in the future of work, it will be the close bonds with your staff, as well as the fostering of trust, which will create innovative In the past decade the number of these creative clusters globally has mushroomed, however, including in Singapore – where Mr Anthony is based – Bangalore and London. A UK Commission for Employment and Skills report says the local digital economy needs 1.2m more individuals by 2022 to keep up with growth. By then there is a real possibility that the whole world – all seven billion and more of us – will be connected to the internet. Even now tech talent is being identified through more unorthodox channels, not least training initiatives and scholarships, and also massive open online courses (MOOCs) that are revolutionising learning. These are on offer at some of the world’s best universities, including Stanford, Harvard and Yale. MOOCs, in particular, can help identify and fast track tech-savvy talent and enable for social mobility. For instance, in 2013 Khadija Niazi, a 12-year-old from the Pakistani city of Lahore, spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos having completed Udacity’s physics course with the highest distinction. She is now studying quantum physics through a Stanford-offered online course. Gamification of online courses could further encourage those in Generation Z to seek education, says Prof Lynda Gratton, another speaker at the Tata Communications NEI. And in a world where medium-skilled work is being increasingly hollowed out by robotics and automation, an agile and curious mind – and training – is critical to success. Once employed in a tech company the individuals should “have the power and autonomy to innovate”, she says, and errors should not be frowned upon. Indeed, Tata Communications, the flagship telecoms arm of the $103.3bn Tata group, encourages free thinking through schemes such as the Dare to Try award, which rewards cutting-edge ideas. And Prof Gratton says that those in charge of nurturing these talents should not play down the importance of their role. “As a leader you have to be authentic and don’t underestimate the power of imitation. While machines will have a big say in the future of work, it will be the close bonds with your staff, interaction, as well as the fostering of trust, which will create the innovative.” Developing people: the expert view Vinod Kumar, chief executive, Tata Communications Building success on diversity “We learn so much from the people in our business and this is reflected in the individuals and skills we have invested in. We have built not just emerging market talent, but global talent as well into our business. “Diversity is really what is going to lead to success for international businesses in the future. “Competitive global businesses require talent from wherever that talent is available. Being global means taking products to more markets in more geographies. It is also about ensuring that the talent pool is being tapped and that we have a deep understanding of how business is done across different cultures.” Julie woods-Moss, CEO of NextGen business, Tata Communications Innovation engine “A really exciting part of my job is that I’ve embedded an innovation team and a business development team. Often with NextGens you start a conversation and it’s not linear. I traded having fewer sales people for a small innovation engine and a very strong business development function, and they can quickly come back with ideas.” See how you can connect your business at tatacommunications.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T00:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T19:48:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
