But it happened, and there is no taking it back.\"\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had turned Sanchez over to authorities in San Francisco on March 26 on an outstanding drug warrant.\nThe Sheriff's Department released Sanchez on April 15 after the San Francisco district attorney's office declined to prosecute him for what authorities said was a decade-old marijuana possession case.\nICE spokeswoman Virginia Kice said the agency had issued a detainer for Sanchez, requesting notification of his release and that he stay in custody until immigration authorities could pick him up. The detainer was not honored, she said.\nFreya Horne , counsel for the San Francisco Sheriff's Department, said Friday that federal detention requests are not sufficient to hold someone. Under the city's sanctuary ordinance, people in the country illegally aren't handed over to immigration officials unless there's a warrant for their arrest.\nLocal officials checked and found none. ICE could have issued an active warrant if it wanted the city to keep Sanchez jailed, Horne said.\nOn Saturday, a bouquet of sunflowers and another of red roses laid at a gate blocking access to Pier 14, a popular place for people who want to get a close-up view of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. Tourists, most unaware of the shooting, sat on nearby benches and on an art installation platform, soaking up the sun while others in U.S. flag T-shirts and hats walked by.\nSan Francisco resident Manuel Gabriel , 50, was taking a stroll with a friend when the pair stopped to look at the pier after hearing what happened on the news. \"It's sad to hear someone so young lost their life in an act of insanity,\" said Gabriel, who said he came to San Francisco from El Salvador 25 years ago.\nAbout the controversy surrounding the city's sanctuary ordinance, Gabriel said it's not a question of documents but of mental health.\n\"U.S. citizens also kill people,\" Gabriel said. \"The issue shouldn't be whether or not he has documents. The question is why authorities would release someone who is not well mentally.\"", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-07-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T06:08:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
