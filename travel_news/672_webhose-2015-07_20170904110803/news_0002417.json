The name of this ecological contemporary hotel reflects its core premise – that great design and environmental awareness can go hand in hand. Green Globe’s exclusive member hotel in Milan, Starhotels E.c.ho. was recently re-certified for the second time and achieved a magnificent compliance score of 90%. \nEvery aspect of E.c.ho’s design is mindful of reducing the property’s ecological footprint. The 125 square meters of solar panels that provide energy to light the corridors and public spaces reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 11 tons annually. The high-efficiency condensing boilers reduce emissions by a further 75 tons per year, while water recovery systems reduce water consumption by 20%. E.c.ho.’s stylish interiors employ eco-friendly and recycled materials throughout, from the fragrant cedar-log tables in the lobby – made using wood from sustainable forests - to the energy-efficient glass in the conservatory. The hotel’s lighting follows the natural rhythms of daylight, intelligent acclimatization systems constantly balance comfort with energy consumption, and even the mattresses in the 143 rooms including 8 junior suites and 6 suites are eco-friendly. Nature lies at the heart of the hotel literally as well as figuratively. A large terrace looks out onto a central garden and a Renaissance chapel by Donato Bramante, the celebrated architect of St Peter’s Basilica, creates an outdoor haven that feels a million miles from city life. Meanwhile, diners at “Orto By Eataly” Restaurant can discover menus that change in tune with the seasons. The partnership with Eataly ensures careful sourcing of ingredients and a close working relationship with the producers. Health-conscious guests can look after body and soul in the panoramic Fitness Room located on the top floor of the hotel while taking in the views over Milan’s skyline. Meanwhile, business travelers will find that environmental awareness doesn’t mean compromising on the latest in technology: the Conference Center’s five high-tech meeting rooms have a total capacity of 240. State-of-the-art energy efficient technology forms the “green heart” of E.c.ho. The installation of fan coil units controlled by a central automation system adjusts temperatures within the property in accordance with the seasons. Similarly power units and circulation pumps with variable airflow systems are adjusted according to heating and cooling needs. Other energy saving measures include the recovery of condensation heat from refrigeration units to pre-heat non-drinking hot water. While energy efficient LED lighting is utilized in most areas and motion sensor lighting is deployed in public bathrooms. Also, a computerized light management system allows the targeted use of lights in specific areas to minimize energy usage. In addition, only the most ecologically efficient gas is utilized to power super silent chillers. In line with the hotel’s water saving strategies, grey water is reused for toilet flushing and low flow water taps have been installed at the property. To lower the generation of CO2 emissions a photovoltaic system on the roof (125 square meters) serves to illuminate the corridors of the rooms and public areas, with savings of 21,000 kWh / per annum, which corresponds to an annual reduction of 11 tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Furthermore, condensing boilers with high thermal efficiency not only lowers fuel consumption but also reduces CO2 emissions by 75 tons. Over a period of one year, total overall expenditure savings for the property is expected to be around 25% for natural gas and 15% for electricity. In addition, the hotel calculates that the total reduction in its carbon emissions equates to 130 tons.
