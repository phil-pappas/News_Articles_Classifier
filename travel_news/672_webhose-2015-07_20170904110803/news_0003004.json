The newly re-vamped hotel is in keeping with the style and heritage of the charming city, drawing inspiration from local influences such as the iconic cycling culture of the historical university town. \nThe stylish, boutique hotel is situated on a quiet street in the center of Oxford, offering the perfect location for visitors to relax and explore the bustling and vibrant ancient city. The Hotel has undergone a full refurbishment with no duvet left unturned making the Oxford Eastgate Townhouse a perfect example of the best hospitality that any Mercure Hotel has to offer. The exterior of the hotel is signed with a classic and colourful bike adding a personalised and welcome touch at the front entrance. The bicycle theme has been adopted throughout the re-design of the hotel, paying homage to the traditional cycling culture of local students and residents. On arrival guests will be greeted by Mercure Oxford Eastgate’s Townhouse feature wall, a signature statement in Mercure’s flagship hotels. The striking feature wall consists of a classic basket-weave design in a modern monotone print, subtly marrying the ancient roots with the modern practices of the trendy cosmopolitan town. The reception and lounge area offers a contemporary but comfortable public space with quirky design features adding to the unique character of the hotel. Inspiration has been drawn from the famously studious and academic town with a cosy ‘desk-lamp’ pendant light fixture, as well as a classic feature bookcase. The re-upholstered interior makes guests feel instantly at home with an array of rich fabrics, patterned soft furnishings and timber flooring. The Mercure Oxford Eastgate Townhouse boasts 64 refurbished bedrooms including a brand new suite, showcasing a luxury bedroom with lounge space. The newly redecorated bedrooms feature an elegant colour scheme with a muted background and opulent jewel accent colours. This is complimented with an antique mirror effect and traditional furniture with bicycle spoke inspired details. Another signature feature of Mercure flagship hotels are the headboards, which exhibit local artwork, images or scenes of the area. The Oxford Eastgate Townhouse headboards display digital prints of punting boats and local statues with an ornate vintage-style frame, again perfectly blending old styles with the new, a running theme throughout the hotel. The refurbishment also includes an upgrade of the Mercure Oxford Eastgate’s Townhouse dining facilities to incorporate the refined High Table Brasserie and the Library Bar and Lounge. The contemporary restaurant has a distinct literary influence in line with the hotel’s university surroundings. The High Table provides fine dining in stylish surroundings with locally sourced produce and is named after a favoured dining tradition at the Oxford colleges. The High Table restaurant also offers a private dining area for business lunches or personal celebrations and the appetising menu brings together the best of modern British and Mediterranean cuisine including a range of fresh grill options. The Mercure Oxford Eastgate Townhouse Hotel is perfect for tourists or business travellers alike wishing to stay in the ‘glocal’ town with free Wi-Fi access, full modern amenities in every room and the sophisticated Library Bar and Lounge to socialise, relax and unwind. The hotel is also proud to host the recently opened Marco’s New York Italian restaurant with signature dishes such as the Italian burger topped with mozzarella and crisp prosciutto. The prime central position of the Mercure Oxford Eastgate Townhouse Hotel is within walking distance of the River Cherwell, famous for punting, and nearby to the popular visitor hot-spot; Blenheim Palace. The hotel also faces many university buildings, so guests are perfectly placed to explore the many colleges and museums of the University of Oxford. The picturesque 17th century building, home to the Mercure Oxford Eastgate Townhouse, was originally a coaching inn known as the Flying Horse. The inn then became known as the Eastgate Hotel for its position on the site of the east gate in the original city walls. It is believed that underneath the original building runs a tunnel connecting the hotel with Magdalen College, just one of a network of ancient tunnels running under the city. Guests can bask in the glow of famous novelists including J.R.R Tolkien and C.S Lewis who frequented the hotel whilst being Fellows at Merton College and Magdalen College respectively. C.S Lewis also famously met, courted and proposed to his future wife at the scenic hotel. Jonathan Sheard, SVP Operations Luxury, Upscale & Midscale, Accor UK & Ireland said, “The newly refurbished Mercure Oxford Eastgate Townhouse Hotel proudly displays the best that Mercure Hotels have to offer in terms of unbeatable hospitality, top modern amenities and innovative hotel design.” Peter Watt, General Manager of the Mercure Oxford Eastgate Townhouse Hotel said, “I am delighted to welcome new and returning guests to experience the new and improved Mercure Oxford Eastgate Townhouse.
