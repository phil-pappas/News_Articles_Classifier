British Airways and Rynair confirmed all flights will resume as planned. Ferry services between Calais and Dover were also resumed at 6pm yesterday, following disruption since Monday as a result of protests by MyFerryLink staff in response to expected job cuts. A partial lift of the blockade has allowed for a “limited” service to run. But with only one sailing allowed to enter the port a time, services will continue to be affected. • Theresa May in Paris for crisis Calais talks Eurotunnel services were suspended on Tuesday due to ferry workers in Calais blocking the train tracks. All train services across the Channel were suspended from the morning and resumed in the evening after the tracks were cleared. Ongoing industrial action will continue to cause disruption to cross-Channel services and unusually high temperatures were expected in France from yesterday, the Foreign Office warned. Thousands of lorry drivers are parked on the M20 in Kent for a fourth day as the partial closure of the port has prevented Channel crossings. Food and water were distributed to stranded lorry drivers by members of the British Coast Guard throughout yesterday. It is unclear when the latest strike by ferry workers – the second in a week - is expected to end, according to officials from the Port of Dover. \"We sincerely regret the impact to the travelling public, freight and the Dover community of a situation that is beyond our control” a spokesman for the Port of Dover said. \"We will continue to monitor the situation closely in liaison with our ferry partners and the Port of Calais in order to resume normal operations as soon as possible,\" the spokesman added.
