According to documents filed in the Erie County Clerk’s office, Byblos Niagara LLC, the international investment consortium which has owned the former Grand Island Holiday Inn for the past two years, sold the 263-room hotel to McSam Hotel Group for $6.25 million. Byblos Niagara paid $3.385 million for the hotel when it acquired it via an October 2012 auction. The hotel’s sale price rose nearly 85 percent in the past two years based on the growing strength of the local hospitality industry as well as renovations and upgrades made to the property. Home of the Day Byblos Niagara included investors for Dubai as well local businessman Roger Trettel . Local real estate investor Dr Fadi Dagher was part of the original Byblos ownership group but sold his interests last year. Efforts to reach McSam, a group led by Long Island businessman Sam Chang , went without any response. The sale had been in the works for more than one year. Hospitality sources said they expect the McSam group to rebrand the hotel, perhaps bringing it back to the Holiday Inn corporate flag. Renovations that began when Byblos bought the hotel will continue. The hotel caters to both the business and corporate clientele as well as the vacation tourist given its location nestled between Buffalo and Niagara Falls. Amenities at the Whitehaven Road hotel include large amounts of meeting space. a fitness center, indoor and outdoor swimming pools and a picturesque view of the Niagara River. The McSam Hotel Group has more than 30 hotels in its portfolio. \nWant Buffalo Travel news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
