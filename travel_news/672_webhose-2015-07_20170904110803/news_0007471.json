They warned that the “dangerous” rituals organised by sports clubs, including biting the heads off goldfish, eating dog food and playing games with chickens, were putting star players off sport. Universities were accused of turning \"a blind eye\" to the activities at the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), which represents top public schools including Eton and Harrow. David Elstone, chairman of the HMC sports committee and headmaster at Hymers College in Hull, warned: \"Someone is going to get seriously ill and even worse. It is just a matter of time.” He said one of his former pupils had given up playing rugby after he refused to play a game naked in Edinburgh city centre at midnight with a live chicken as the ball. The ceremony had been organised by the Edinburgh University rugby club. • Shocking Cambridge initiation ceremonies revealed • Warwick investigates 'weird' student initiation ceremony Andrew Fleck, headmaster at Sedbergh School in Cumbria, where former pupils was among those caught in a stripping initiation ceremony on the London Underground last year, has written to 22 universities urging them to stop the practice. However only 12 vice-chancellors responded, he said. “The stories nearly always involve nudity, alcohol and repulsive behaviour,\" he told the Sunday Times. \"Most pupils are embarrassed, but they say they have to take part if they want to go on playing sport.” A judge condemned the “bullying and humiliating” culture three years ago when six drunken students from Gloucestershire University were caught performing sex acts on a double-decker bus as part of an initiation ceremony into the football and rugby clubs.
