Learn what to expect here. \nFor some unenlightened people, the expression \"activity holidays\" may bring certain images to mind. But if, for you, it conjures up notions of a regimented routine with some run-of-the-mill activities, the good news is that you can forget all that! The new generation of activity holidays are about as far removed from that as the modern car is from the horse and cart. \nWhat to Expect \nSome providers are able to offer a highly customised holiday experience. It will, of course, be built around certain core travel arrangements, but you can undertake or choose not to undertake just about any activity you like. \nDepending on the destination, you can look at a huge range of things to do - ranging from horse riding to white water rafting to the more off-the-beaten-track ski touring - then simply decide what you want to participate in. If something doesn’t appeal, don't choose it – but if there's something you've always wanted to try, but never quite got there, these kind of bespoke activity holidays are the time to do it! This experience is about you (and your family) engaging in adventure-filled activities of your own choosing - not doing what a holiday provider tells you! \nFreedom \nIn fact, the biggest surprise in terms of this kind of bespoke holiday is that ability to do what you want and when you want to do it. Let’s say you are staying on a ranch in the Western USA. Want to spend a full day in the saddle exploring the stunning countryside? No problem. Want to go hiking out into the wilds with a guide to commune with nature? You're the boss – and that's the point. \nOrdinary people \nA worry that may affect some people arises from the lingering notion that suggests everyone on an adventurous holiday must be superhumanly fit. The reality is that people of all ages and fitness levels can enjoy these experiences. You will typically see family members ranging from children to grandparents being fully engaged in whatever the given activity is, with provision made for different levels and an assurance that nobody will be asked to do more than they are capable of. (Of course, some activities, as you might expect, do have certain minimum age or height requirements.) \nIf you like thrills, spills, fun and adventure, perhaps it's time to consider eschewing the regular \"fly and flop\" beach holiday this year and, instead, dive into one of the amazing activity holidays available to exciting destinations all over the world.   \nRichard Edwards is the Managing Director of Summit & Blue, an adventure holiday company offering independently crafted activity holidays to exciting destinations around the world, including France, Italy, Portugal, the USA and Canada. With unique itineraries and exciting activities like biking, hiking, white water rafting and canoeing, we create holidays for those looking for an experience a little more off the beaten track.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T07:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T01:28:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
