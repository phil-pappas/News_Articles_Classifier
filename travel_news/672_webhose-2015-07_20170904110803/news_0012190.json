It has a flap that closes over its micro-USB input and two 5-volt charging ports (1 amp and 2.4 amps for rapid charging). LED lights show remaining power, but Braven's free iOS and Android power-monitoring app offer a more precise reading. The app also allows users to turn the battery on or off or send out a bear alarm or visual SOS alert in emergencies. And if that weren't cause enough to take it camping, a USB 100-lumen bulb is supplied to transform the battery into a flashlight. A lanyard and weatherized micro-USB charging cable are included. \nThe good: This backup battery can be an adventurer's best friend, because you can recharge your devices inside or out. It has been a trusty backup on several trips, including the wet, rugged wilderness of Quebec last August, a frigid Dark Sky festival and skiing in Alberta, and January weather in Belgium. \nThe bad: It would be a stand-alone backup if it came with retractable lightning and micro-USB cable. \nCost: $99.99 \nAvailable from: http://www.braven.com , http://www.crutchfield.com and http://www.amazon.com \nTerry Gardner is a freelance reporter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T00:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T01:07:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
