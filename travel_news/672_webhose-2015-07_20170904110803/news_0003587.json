Europe’s aviation watchdog has called for two pilots be present in cockpits at all times, in the wake of the Germanwings disaster when 150 people lost their lives. Picture: Supplied. Source: Supplied \nEUROPE’S aviation watchdog has recommended that two people be present in plane cockpits at all times after a lone rogue pilot apparently deliberately crashed a Germanwings jet in March, killing all 150 people on board. \nThe European Aviation Safety Agency says pilots should “undergo psychological evaluation” during training or before entering service and face random drug and alcohol tests, although investigators have not cited those substances as factors in the Germanwings tragedy. \n“This report is the result of a thorough analysis with practical recommendations so that such a tragic event does not happen again,” EASA executive director Patrick Ky said in a statement on Friday. Tragic ... Gemanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, who had a history of severe depression, reportedly sought advice from dozens of doctors about his condition. Picture: Getty Images Source: Supplied \nInvestigators say 27-year-old German co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, who had a history of severe depression, intentionally slammed the Airbus A320 into the French Alps. \nThey say he locked the other pilot out of the cockpit when the latter went to the toilet on the March 24 flight from Barcelona to Dusseldorf, and then put the aircraft into a steep dive as his colleague tried desperately to get back in. \nFrench prosecutors said Lubitz, who suffered from “psychosis”, was terrified of losing his sight and consulted 41 different doctors in the previous five years, including psychiatrists and ear, throat and nose specialists. \nSeveral of these doctors who were questioned by German investigators said Lubitz complained he had only 30 per cent vision, saw flashes of light and suffered such crippling anxiety he could barely sleep. \nLubitz reportedly said “life has no sense with this loss of vision”. Fruitless search ... French police and nvestigators work among the scattered debris on the crash site of the Germanwings Airbus A320 that crashed in the French Alps in March, killing 150 people. Picture: AFP Source: AFP \nHowever the doctors he consulted — including one who booked him off work two days before the ill-fated flight — did not reveal his mental struggles because of doctor-patient confidentiality rules. \nImmediately after the crash, the EASA published a “temporary recommendation for airlines to ensure that at least two crew, including at least one qualified pilot, are in the flight crew compartment at all times of the flight”. \nMany European airlines enforced such a measure before the crash and others have adopted it since. \nAfter a three-month review ordered by the European Commission, the EU executive arm, EASA confirmed the recommendation and said it would look at the situation again after a year. \nAirlines will have to ensure the psychological evaluations are carried out properly, it said. \nMore widely, it recommended “the establishment of a robust oversight program over the performance of aero-medical examiners”. ‘Improvements’ ... Many European airlines have already enforced the two-pilot rule since the Germanwings crash in March. Picture: AFP Source: AFP \nIn addition, a “European aero-medical data repository” would be a step towards sharing medical information about airline crew. \nVioleta Bulc, the EU commissioner for transport, welcomed the findings of the study undertaken at her request. \n“If improvements are to be made in European safety and security rules or in their implementation, in order to help prevent future accidents or incidents, we will take the necessary action at EU level,” she said. \nThe watchdog carried out its review in parallel with the French investigation, whose final report on the crash is due in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T18:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T22:04:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
