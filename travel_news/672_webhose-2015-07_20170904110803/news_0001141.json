Email us at doc@docholiday.com.au . Personal replies from the Doc are unfortunately not possible.\nWE will have a five-day stay in New York early next year. What is on your must-do and must see list?\nA must and it’s free ... Walk through Central Park in New York — the green lung of New York. Picture: AFP / Jewel Samad Source: AFP\nDoc: Most people are aware of New York’s iconic attractions , so I’m going to tell you about some of the lesser known free and low-cost options for you to consider.\nFirst, for your accommodation, try the neighbourhoods of Lower Manhattan and Herald Square for good rates.\nWhen looking for some culture, head to the Bronx Museum of the Arts, Socrates Sculpture Park in Queens and the Snug Harbour Cultural Centre Botanical Garden on Staten Island. They all offer free entry year-round.\nThe 9/11 Memorial and Museum is free on Tuesdays between 5pm and 8pm, the New York Botanical Gardens are free on Wednesdays, and the Museum of Modern Art is free on Fridays from 4pm-8pm.\nFor a good inside look around the five boroughs free of charge, try Big Apple Greeter . This not-for-profit organisation of local volunteers enjoys showcasing their area to tourists.\nThe Central Park and Battery Park Conservancies also provide free tours.\nBroadway Week and off-Broadway Week around early October and mid February, when most of the Broadway shows offer two-for-one tickets, is well worth considering in your planning. During the off-peak periods you will usually find many dining and theatre packages on promotion.\nInclude Governor’s Island, a 70ha island in the New York Harbour. Here you’ll find public art, parks and the Hammock Grove (for some relaxation). There are views of the Statue of Liberty, New York Harbour and Lower Manhattan.\nFor additional outdoor activities, Staten Island has the Greenbelt, where you can hike, cycle or go fishing.\nBe sure to buy the New York City Pass for discounted entry into some of the other attractions including the American Museum of Natural History and the Empire State Building Experience.\nOr the Downtown Culture Pass, which offers three days of unlimited admissions to more than 12 Lower Manhattan attractions, museums and tours.\nA couple more ideas you may wish to look at is heading along to a taping of your favourite US TV show, popping down to the West Village for a wander and cup cake at Magnolia Bakery and gazing at the mural on the ceiling of the main concourse at Grand Central Station.\nWhile at Grand Central, take a tour of this magnificent building and learn its hidden secrets. You can download an audio tour app to your smart phone or buy a ticket from the Municipal Art Society window. This tour runs for about 75 minutes and departs each day at 12.30pm.\nFLYING from Vietnam to Singapore I was really surprised to see a passenger knitting. How is it we can’t take tweezers and nail scissors in hand luggage? I would have thought knitting needles more dangerous. Do you know what the law is on this?\nKnitting needles are not banned as a carry on-board item. Source: News Limited\nDoc: Almost every time I travel internationally I see contradictions on what is allowed to be carried on-board. The Australian Government classifies a prohibited item for carry on-board an aircraft and one which must be packed in checked-in luggage as: A blunt object that could be used to bludgeon or threaten someone; a sharp object that could be used to cause bodily harm; a flammable household good; an object that could be used to restrain someone.\nOn its website you will find a long list of examples, and yes, one would assume knitting needles would be on this list. But they are not, and I agree this seems odd. They are one of the many items that may be taken on board in your carry-on bags — “at the discretion of the security screening officer at the airport”.\nCountries that officially state (in the flight regulations) that knitting needles are allowed include the US, the UK and Australia.\nMost countries in the EU explicitly prohibit knitting needles on flights, and the rest seem to leave it up to the security officer to determine. Strange but true.\nWE ARE travelling to the Gold Coast with a stop in Brisbane first. Can you explain what the Airtrain is?\nThe Brisbane Airtrain is the fastest and easiest way from the airport to Brisbane and the Gold Coast. Source: News Limited\nDoc: Brisbane’s Airtrain is the fastest and easiest way to get from the airport to Brisbane and suburbs, and the Gold Coast. The Airtrain platforms are connected to the domestic and international terminals via a walking bridge. Trains depart every 15 minutes from the city in peak periods and every 30 minutes in off-peak periods to the airport, and the ride takes 20 minutes. The trip to the Gold Coast from the airport only makes five stops before arriving at Varsity Lakes, with the first service leaving the airport at 5.04am, arriving 6.52am on weekdays. You will need to connect then to a bus or taxi to your final destination on the Gold Coast as the train station is inland.\nAlternatively you could opt for the Airtrain Connect service, which provides a transfer service in conjunction with the train ticket.\nBook your ticket in advance for savings including 15 per cent discount if the tickets are booked online seven or more days before travel.\nYou can also take advantage of the Passbook discount voucher program, offering discounts up to 20 per cent at a range of attractions on the Gold Coast.", "external_links": ["http://travelsecure.infrastructure.gov.au/", "http://www.nycgo.com/slideshows/must-see-financial-district", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/10/1227436/842894-a5b81b90-2071-11e5-97a8-3165311c9b30.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/10/1227436/842391-f85ea1fc-2071-11e5-97a8-3165311c9b30.jpg", "http://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Attraction_Review-g60763-d548744-Reviews-Herald_Square-New_York_City_New_York.html", "http://bigapplegreeter.org/", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/10/1227436/842816-aebfbf12-2072-11e5-97a8-3165311c9b30.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-13T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T23:54:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
