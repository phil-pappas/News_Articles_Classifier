I think we have accompanied the city (of Havana) for some time, bar manager Ariel Blanco said.\nThe Floridita serves daily between 600 and 700 customers, who pay $6 for each daiquiri, and is one of the two most famous bars in Cuba. The other is the “Bodeguita del Medio,” where Hemingway used to drink mojitos, also in Old Havana.\nDespite the United States-Cuba political dispute after the 1959 revolution, devotion to Hemingway was kept alive on the Communist island. In fact, he is one of Fidel Castro’s favorite writers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T00:09:38.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
