The new service is further demonstration of the carrier's commitment to uniting friends and family on both sides of the border. \n\"Low fares have arrived in New York!\" said Jose Luis Suarez, Volaris Customer Services and Sales Director. \"Our attractive business model enables us to offer clean and straightforward fares for anyone who wishes to travel to Guadalajara. Now, flying to Mexico's Perla Tapatia, as Guadalajara is commonly known, is possible at very attractive fares, on a non-stop flight and on board one of the youngest fleets in the Americas.\" \nSuarez spoke of the potential flow of tourism the new flight will bring to New York, \"who can resist the remarkable variety of attractions in the Big Apple? Visitors from this region in Mexico are sure to be marveled by the city that never sleeps.\" \nThe new service helps Volaris strengthen their positioning as the Mexican airline with the widest route network in both Mexico and the US, operating 140 routes to 62 destinations, of which 23 are international and 38 domestic. To date, Volaris has transported 50 million passengers since initiating operations, and of these, nearly 7 million have traveled to the US. This number is constantly increasing as a result of an average 240 flights per day. \n\"The entry of Volaris into John F. Kennedy International Airport for service to and from Mexico will increase competition and offer more choices to travelers in the New York/New Jersey metropolitan region,\" said Port Authority Aviation Director Thomas Bosco. \"We are pleased to welcome Volaris to help serve the expanding travel needs of our customers and the region.\" \n\"New York City is the number one destination for Mexican air travel, with an estimated 408,000 visitors last year,\" said Fred Dixon, NYC & Company president and CEO. \"This brand new Volaris flight between Guadalajara and New York City's JFK International Airport is just another proof point that the destination remains top of mind for Mexican travelers, whom we look forward to welcoming to the five boroughs this year and beyond.\" \n\"Volaris new route will undoubtedly allow for more connectivity options between the northeastern US and the Western-Pacific area of Mexico, and will take advantage of Guadalajara's road infrastructure and its many domestic flights. This flight will facilitate trade opportunities between these two cities with large financial, business and tourism presence. Guadalajara has a booming industry, mainly manufacturing electronic equipment, pharmaceutical and steel products,\" said Ambassador Sandra Fuentes-Berain, Consul General of Mexico in New York. \nFlight schedules, including dates and times of operation, are announced as follows: \nGuadalajara, Jalisco – New York, New York (Effective July 15, 2015.
