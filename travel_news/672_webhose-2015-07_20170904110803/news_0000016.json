A Mississippi woman suffered minor injuries recently when a bison flipped her after she turned her back to pose for a selfie with the beast.\nIn the lead opinion Monday, Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain reasoned that park officials had discretion in deciding how to handle the problem goat.\nBut the other judge in the majority, Marsha Berzon, wrote that while she was bound by 9th Circuit precedent, she agreed with dissenting Judge Andrew Kleinfeld that \"our jurisprudence in this area has gone off the rails\" and needs to be reconsidered.\nIn his dissent, Kleinfeld said the case wasn't a matter of discretion — just ordinary negligence.\n\"Letting an identified aggressive 370-pound goat threaten park visitors and rangers for years until it killed one amounted to a failure to implement the formally established park policy for managing dangerous animals,\" Kleinfeld wrote. \"Written park policy provided a series of steps for dealing with animals dangerous to park visitors, from frightening the animal away to removing or killing it.\"\nSome legal scholars have long criticized the notion that the federal government is immune from lawsuits when officials exercise discretion, saying that virtually any action or inaction by a government official can be rationalized that way.\nOne of Chadd's attorneys, James McCormick said Tuesday he considered Berzon's concurring opinion an invitation to ask the 9th Circuit to rehear the case with a larger panel of jurists — and to perhaps clarify the law.\n\"The intention of the law was to protect high level discretion of policy makers, not the day-to-day actions of people on the ground,\" McCormick said. \"This is a case that deserves to get tried on the merits.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T16:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T05:29:12.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
