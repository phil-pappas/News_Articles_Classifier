I have no idea. Should the need arise, however, I can say it’s the perfect place to spend 18 hours. I did just that on a recent Thursday, from 7 a.m. to 1 a.m., during a bus trip from New York to Kentucky. Why would I take a bus from New York to Kentucky via Knoxville? That’s a story for next week, but getting to hang out in Knoxville was part of the incentive. See More » In the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains, the third-biggest city in Tennessee is not a particularly flashy town, unless you count the University of Tennessee’s bright orange uniforms. I had no vehicle for getting into the mountains, but I did take in two free musical performances, see an unexpectedly cool museum, and have four good beers and two excellent meals. I made at least one new friend, browsed a record store that also sold laser-discs, wandered a historic district of early 20th-century homes and learned something about Dolly Parton. It cost me almost exactly $50, including an Uber ride. (No sale on those laser-discs, though.) Photo The Blue Plate Special, a live, free concert, takes place in the city’s Visitors Center. Credit Joe Buglewicz for The New York Times Morning Just after 7 a.m., I made the short walk from the bus station to South Gay Street, Knoxville’s main drag, and headed to the Old City section, where I found OliBea , a breakfast place with brightly painted walls and plenty of sunlight. It was as cheery a contrast to the crowded, smelly bus that I had just disembarked as I could imagine. For budgetary purposes (and in part because I had bought an ill-advised bag of Combos during a 3 a.m. rest stop), I skipped the breakfast plates (smoked-trout omelet, carnita tostada) and went à la carte: a bracing cup of coffee ($2.50), a biscuit ($1.99) and duck eggs over easy ($2.49). I had never had duck eggs for breakfast before, but I operate under the general philosophy that everything duck is better than everything chicken, so went for it. I was rewarded with creamy, gooey yolks that made a perfect dipping sauce for a silky biscuit already slathered with house-made jam. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story There are several cultural institutions in town, including the Knoxville Museum of Art and the Women’s Basketball Hall of Fame , but I was drawn to the East Tennessee Historical Society , where entrance is $5. No way would I have spent the money for the Central or West Tennessee Historical Societies, but the East? A no-brainer. That’s a joke I told myself when I still thought the subject sounded a bit overly specific. But the exhibit “Voices of East Tennessee” makes a clear, convincing case that the east is, in fact, distinct enough to warrant its own venue. It’s the Appalachian part of the state, settled by hardy pioneers who farmed and hunted, lumbered, mined coal — and somewhere along the way, at least, claimed to have invented country music. I confess, however, to spending too much time in a recreated early 20th-century pharmacy checking out the odd salves and pills and tinctures, including Vitamized Yeast Foam Tablets, whatever those are (I later found out ), to Spirit of Black-Draught (“A Pleasant Tasting Laxative”). \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Afternoon Knoxville has a live, free concert nearly every day year round — now that’s impressive. The Blue Plate Special , from listener-supported WDVX radio, takes place at noon in the city’s Visitors Center . In front of a crowd of about 40, the first act was a guitarist named Ross Adams, who played country-ish ballads; the rocking Blackfoot Gypsies, who had way more energy than the crowd, followed. “You guys are doing a great job of handling your excitement,” said the singer Matthew Paige, in a good-natured cross-generational jab at the audience, most of whom had a few decades on him. Lunch was going to be a hike, literally. I had read about a sandwich shop over two miles away near the gracious old houses of the Old North Knoxville Historic District. I skipped the bus — walking, I’ve found, can turn up interesting things. In this case that meant a marker noting the address where Dolly Parton had her broadcast debut, singing at age 7 from what was then the WTVK studios. Scattered along the route were a bakery, a craft beer store, a vintage shop, a record store, interspersed with junky used-goods shops and Original Freezo, a stuck-in-time soft ice cream and burger stand. (Frozen Mountain Dew, $1.30.) My destination, the North Corner Sandwich Shop , was easy to miss, what with its generic sign plopped on the sidewalk as if it were announcing a flea market. But inside was an owner worth meeting — David Wayne Blevins, who turns out impressive hoagies and decadent and grilled cheese sandwiches in a very downscale building. I ordered the Cattleman ($7.99), house-made roast beef, smoked Gouda and caramelized unions, simple and perfect on bread that seemed to have been soaked in butter before it was grilled. Photo The Time Warp Tea Room. Credit Joe Buglewicz for The New York Times But my praise was rebuffed. According to Mr. Blevins, his sandwiches were only good by comparison. “So many people do a bad job, or should I say a mediocre job,” he said, before turning the subject to his meanderings around the country before he came to Knoxville and how he salvaged a large poster of a midtown Manhattan cityscape from being left out for garbage collection. A man and woman at the next table over told me I was in a gentrifying part of town called Happy Holler; the man, of New Jerseyan descent, knew to explain to me that “holler” is a local variant of hollow — a valley. (Sure enough, my American Heritage Dictionary denotes “holler” as “specifically of Appalachian English.”) When I left, I think he saw himself in me as I walked away. “I’m about to close down,” Mr. Blevins said. “I could drive you. I know what it’s like to be a traveler.” I half-accepted his offer, and asked him to drop me off part way back to explore a few of the spots I had seen along the way. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T20:28:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
