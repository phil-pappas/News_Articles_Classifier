It hurts that they would even consider having this abomination on their shirt. QATAR AIRWAYS MUST GO \" \nBarca didn't have any sponsor at all until it signed a 5-year partnership with UNICEF in 2006, but it has since introduced the high-profile corporate sponsors. \nThe club signed a €150m deal with the Qatar Foundation ahead of the 2011/12 season, which was then replaced by Qatar Airways for the 2013/14 season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T00:20:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
