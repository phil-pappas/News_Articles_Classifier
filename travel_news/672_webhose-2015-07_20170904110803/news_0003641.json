Now that the self-professed tech-junkie has gotten his hands on it, he’s more excited than ever. \n“I can input map coordinates into the watch and it would buzz me whenever I’m supposed to make a turn. I don’t have to have my face glued to the screen. It feels nice. And I can even communicate by sending my heartbeat to my wife,” he enthused. \nHe’s just as gung-ho about the recent changes in Expedia. The Seattle-based company took a majority stake in AirAsia Expedia earlier this year, along with acquisitions of online travel agencies Orbitz and Travelocity. \n“It’s good news for travellers — we’re investing with these brands; our technology will also be improving at an accelerated pace with these changes for a breakthrough in travel,” Kim said, adding that he is currently working on a few more projects to reach that goal, although he couldn’t reveal what they were just yet. “Maybe in four months’ time,” he teased. \nOf course, travellers don’t have to wait that long to get a good deal from Expedia. Kim pointed out the various ways people could take advantage of the travel website’s offerings. “When you buy a flight via Expedia, you can see — for a limited time — some of the package rates that make your trip easier and cheaper. And Expedia is able to provide freebies such as your hotel room or flight for free — based on your length of stay. I tell my friends to check Expedia for the free stuff first. I’d feel bad for you if you pay full price.” \nKim said he either reads or plays games to disconnect while on holiday. — TODAY pic What do you think will be a major game changer in the travel industry? \nA: Travellers are seeking content to help them find out what they are going to experience. They want to know the value of things they’re buying whether it’s the flight or the hotel or an activity. I think (the change) we’ll see in the next three to five years is (in the) type of content consumers (will have) to get closer and closer to the experience they’re able to buy. It’s not only “more photos”; it’s more data from reviews, such as real-time reviews, videos and virtual reality. \nHow does a tech-junkie like you disconnect when you travel? \nA: I read a book. It’s the simplest thing to do. Find one with a good story that will really draw you in. But I still love playing games to pass the time — I like Tower Defence games and Sudoku. I’m trying to play a little less. \nHow do you ensure you stay on top of things when you travel? \nA: There are so many things that you could miss when you travel, like whether you’ve brought the right charger. I build a checklist of what I need. I keep reusing and adjusting my checklist based on where I’m going. That eases my stress and I can focus on the actual travelling and schedule because I know I have packed everything I need. \nWas there a trip that really changed you the way you saw the world? \nA: My wife and I took a trip to Bali in 2011. It was very eye-opening. My wife really wanted to visit the spiritual healers and spend some time in the country. I gained a much better appreciation of life without technology, which for me, because I’m a freak, is a good reminder that there is a connection that centres around talking to people and is about friendships, about how they help one another out in the villages. There is a whole world out there that is just as good and less complicated and maybe even happier. When I get stressed, I like to think about that. You can change the world you see very easily by just a memory. — TODAY More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T06:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T06:40:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
