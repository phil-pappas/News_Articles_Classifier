No, not those pictures of the then Princess Elizabeth snapped as a child apparently giving a Nazi salute . Rather, startling photos of our reigning monarch, taken only the other week, as she drove her Jaguar X-type estate down the Long Walk on the Windsor estate. For the images revealed that our soon to be 90 year-old royal ruler seemed so impatient to get to church that she veered her sleek motor onto a grass verge in order to avoid a young family strolling through Windsor Great Park. This so called minor episode was broadly greeted with affection and bemusement. Her Maj reborn as the new Lewis Hamilton . Who'd have thought it? As we all get older factors such as deteriorating health, including eyesight and reaction times, have a significant adverse effect that outweighs having greater experience and caution Dave Nichols, spokesman for Brake Yet in my mind, the incident raises a far more troubling concern: and that is the UK's liberal licensing procedure for older drivers. Put simply, it seems astonishing that the law in this country doesn't require motorists over 70 to retake their driving test in order to confirm (or confound) their safety on the road. Not that I am, for a moment, suggesting that the Queen is a dangerous driver. The Queen veering onto the grass to avoid a small family (Kelvin Bruce) But the very sight of her navigating a powerful motor around a party of strolling day trippers was an enduring reminder of the fact that when it comes to fitness to drive amongst older people, it is purely a matter of self-regulation. Licences must be renewed at the age of 70 and every three years after that. Yet the onus is on the driver to self-certify as being fit to drive. Indeed at the end of last year a judge told elderly drivers that they must ‘face up to facts’ if they are no longer safe on the roads after sentencing an 84-year-old woman who killed an 80-year-old man in a head-on smash. Judge Stephen Holt also urged families and friends to ‘monitor’ ageing relatives as he imposed a five-year driving ban on Beryl Hughes and a 24-week jail sentence suspended for 12 months. Surely it makes perfect sense. After all, would you want an 85 year-old surgeon at your operating table? Yet despite dwindling eyesight, poorer reaction times and, all the other lamentable challenges which go with getting older, it's down to the individual to stop driving. Only the other week an elderly driver escaped serious injury on Hayling Island in Hampshire when she accidently accelerated, and crashed through the large windows of a petrol forecourt. It only takes a swift glance at the statistics to see that, with an increasingly ageing population, the matter of compulsory re-tests must be addressed. Poor eyesight could negatively affect your driving (Alamy) The proportion of over-70s who drive soared to nearly 60 per cent in 2010, from just 15 per cent in 1975 – a four-fold rise. At the end of March 2015 there were 4.3 million licence holders aged 70 and over. More than a million are over 80. According to the AA by 2030 more than 90% of men over 70 will be behind the wheel. Not that I am alone in thinking this way. Last year a survey by specialist insurance provider Rias found that one in five motorists over 50 believe they would fail their driving test if they had to retake it today, . This followed research by Auto Trader which suggested the majority of drivers want a compulsory retest when people reach pension age. Perhaps at this point, I should declare a personal interest too. My late mum had a near fatal car accident in 2006, at the age of 74. Mystery still surrounds the circumstances which caused her Nissan Micra to spin round and land on its head as she tootled along a quiet suburban road one sunny afternoon in early spring. Thankfully, no one else was injured. But mum spent nine weeks in hospital – three of which in a critical condition – suffering with a head injury and broken bones in her spine. She had no recollection of what caused the accident. There were no extenuating factors and the only thing that the police could conclude was that it was human error (something my mum robustly denied). The police did not pursue the matter since, owing to the severity of mum's injures and the fact that, thanks to the persuasion of her three children, she reluctantly agreed to hang up her driving licence. Of course, there's no way of knowing if age had any impact on the accident. After all, many drivers admit to losing concentration or feeling over tired. Sometimes, we can simply be absorbed by our thoughts. But surely all of these variables are more acute when we are older. Especially at high-speed junctions roundabouts or slip roads onto motorways and dual carriageways where the need to think quickly and make swift decisions is paramount. Maybe mum would have felt better if she had been previously compelled to take a re-test – if only to prove her ability to drive carefully Specialist motoring lawyer Michael Pace of Andrew & Co solicitors believes there is a need to review the current system. \"After passing a driving test you are deemed fit and competent to carry on driving until you are 70 years old or until a Court says otherwise. Then, at the age of 70, all you have to do is apply for a new licence and declare that you are fit to drive. Most people would be reluctant to give up the freedom which being able to drive brings. In my experience a lot of older people only stop driving after being involved in some sort of incident. It is time, bearing in mind the density of traffic these days, that some better system is put in place to check a person’s ability to drive which might be by way of a medical or by a driving test.\" There is no legal age at which anyone must stop driving. Though a DVLA spokesman points out that frailty is an issue with older drivers, so those involved in accidents are more likely to be injured. Angela believes older drivers should have to renew their licences (Alamy) Statistically, drivers over the age of 60 are no more likely to be involved in crashes than other motorists and they are less likely to take risks like speeding or driving distracted. However, according to Dave Nichols, spokesman for Brake, the road safety charity , drivers over 80 are proportionately involved in more crashes: \"As we all get older factors such as deteriorating health, including eyesight and reaction times, have a significant adverse effect that outweighs having greater experience and caution.\" He added that Brake had long called for compulsory professional eyesight tests every time drivers renew their licence. \"Licence renewal also provides an opportunity to ensure drivers with other medical problems which may make them unsafe to drive are not allowed back on the road. The government needs to look at how this can be more rigorously enforced, rather than simply expecting drivers to self-certify that they are fit to drive.\" Ultimately road traffic law must strike a balance between safety and personal mobility. Many older drivers cherish the independence that motoring gives them. If longevity behind the wheel makes for a safe and experience driver then let a test prove that. So, long live our gracious Queen. And perhaps you could prove that with a driving test too. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T10:20:19.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
