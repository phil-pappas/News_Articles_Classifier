He went on to lead the Chiltern/MTRC joint venture bid for London Overground and became deputy managing director in 2007 before returning to Chiltern as managing director in 2011.\nFollowing his return Mr Brighouse oversaw the completion of the £130m Evergreen 3 investment to speed up services between the West Midlands and London. He continues to work closely with Network Rail on construction of a new rail link between Oxford and London, due for completion in October 2015, the first between London and a major British city in over 100 years.\nNetwork Rail chairman, Sir Peter Hendy CBE, said: “Network Rail’s board plays a vital role, setting the strategic direction of the business and overseeing delivery of our plans to build a bigger, better railway for Britain and create economic growth, jobs and housing.\n“Rob brings with him decades of experience at the sharp end of the rail industry, providing first-hand expertise of the wide range of issues facing train operators and Network Rail. He will be a hugely valuable addition to the board and I look forward to him joining us in the new year.”\nRob Brighouse said: “The unique Chiltern Railways franchise has a long history of customer driven infrastructure investment and works in partnership with Network Rail and others to deliver these tangible passenger benefits.\n“Hopefully this experience over the last 15 years at both Chiltern and London Overground has provided me with a unique insight and customer focus which, in turn, should be of benefit to Network Rail, the DfT and the ultimate customers of the railway network as the modernisation programme progresses.”\nMr Brighouse announced earlier this month that he would be stepping down from his role at Chiltern Railways at the end of the year. His appointment to the board of Network Rail is effective from 10 January 2016.\nSource:- Network Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:47:31.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
