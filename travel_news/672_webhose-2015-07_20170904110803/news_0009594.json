Hotels have become more affordable now, after a period of price adjustments since 4Q2014.” \n\nRocky Kho, managing director of Skyzone Tours & Travel in Kuala Lumpur, said: “The adjustments in hotel pricing has made the destination more attractive this year and the new travel stimulation programme is an added incentive for Malaysian planners to consider Macau which is usually perceived to be on the (pricey) side.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T09:36:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
