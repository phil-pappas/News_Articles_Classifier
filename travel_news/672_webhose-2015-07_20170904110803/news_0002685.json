In the last six months Club Med has had six additional resorts certified: Club Med Guilin and Club Med Yubuli, China; Club Med Ixtapa Pacific and Club Med Cancun Yucatan, Mexico; Club Med Val Thorens Sensations, France; and Club Med Rio das Pedras, Brazil. This brings the resort group’s total number of certified villages to 44, which is sixty percent of its properties across 20 countries. \nTo responsibly manage this broad global footprint Club Méditerranée believes, “The moments of happiness that the resorts offers to guests are to be shared and these moments cannot be experienced either at the expense of others or of nature.” \nA decade ago Club Med established a Sustainable Development Department, with its core priority to understand key development issues through ground breaking Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) of their vacation resorts. \nTranslating these findings and beliefs into action, Club Med is guided by a set of practices, which are at the heart of sustainable development. Environmental practices include: building resorts that blend harmoniously within sites of exceptional beauty; being extremely vigilant with energy efficiency; saving, treating and recycling water; promoting renewable energy sources and controlling the water treatment and recycling techniques. \nClub Med follows bio-climatic construction principles in its design and construction of resorts and protection of biodiversity. Since 2011, Club Med's has had its own environmental building guidelines, and also looks to adhere to renowned environmental certifications. Typically built surfaces cover only 8% of a total resort site surface (excluding snow resorts). \nEnvironmental impact assessments are part of this process as well as conservation or reintroduction of native species of fauna and flora including primary forests. The development of Club Med Rio das Pedras, Brazil and Club Med Cherating, Malaysia have together succeeded in preserving more than 1000 ha of primary forest as nature reserves. Club Med Ixtapa and Club Med Cancun Yucatan, Mexico work with the Mexican Ministry of Ecology on a turtle conservation program, which protects and releases baby turtles to help bolster their numbers in the wild. \nClub Med’s construction principles have also resulted in efficient use of energy with an overall 6% reduction in energy use across its resorts worldwide. Club Med Val Thorens Sensations, France has received VHPE certification (Very High Energy Performance) and last year Club Med Valmorel was the first hotel certified under France’s HQE label. \nRenewable energy also contributes to greenhouse gas reduction with Club Med resorts sourcing the majority or all electricity from sustainable power supplies. French resorts, Club Med Saint Moritz sources 80% of its energy from renewables, Club Med Tignes draws 100% from renewables. Club Med Val d'Isère and Club Med Peisey Vallandry offset 65% of their electricity needs with green certificates dedicated to renewable energy. \nFurther limiting their environmental impact, Club Med’s waste management process has been improved and accelerated by the roll out of Green Globe certification across the majority of resorts. \nWaste reduction is achieved via purchasing products, whenever possible, that minimize or eliminate individual packaging. Resorts also set targets to reduce material that is not reused or recycled with the aim of moving toward zero waste. \nCommitments made under Green Globe certification continue to be implemented and include, systematic sorting carried out in all resort departments and more efforts to compost organic waste. 92% of all Club Med resorts monitor their waste output and thanks to multiple on-site practices have achieved a benchmark of 101grams of total waste generated per guest meal served. \nTo ensure that their resorts are not burdening the water supply of local communities, all resorts treat 100% of their waste-water and near half of them recycle this water for irrigation. Green Globe certified Club Med Guilin, China and Club Med La Plantation d’Albion, Mauritius use an ecological and innovative system, Jardins Filtrants®, which are reconstructed wetland gardens that effectively treat all waste-water. \nClub Med’s societal and cultural practices focus on an ever-present desire to contribute to local development and the opportunity to bring together in harmony people of very different origins, religions, nationalities and settings. The presence of a Club Med resort brings with it economic and social benefits to a region, in particular through local employment, know-how transfer and local purchasing. 91% of goods purchased by Club Med resorts come from local (national) suppliers and local employees occupy 74% of the resorts’ jobs. \nClub Med also partners with Agrisud International to assist small family business and co-operatives in developing destinations. Agrisud works to up-skill workers and improve sustainable agriculture production, with support provided to 180 Very Small Enterprises globally. \nClub Med extends its commitment to sustainability by inviting guests and friends to directly support the unique and beautiful destinations that host their resorts. At the local level, for example, Club Med Yabuli, China has organized a guest program, which provides school materials for the nearby Primary School of Shang Li. At the global level, the Club Méditerranée Foundation has created Les Amis de la Fondation Club Méditerranée (Friends of the Club Méditerranée Foundation) in order to welcome financial donations from guests wanting to get involved in the resort company’s charitable work. Tens of thousands of Euros have been raised with 98% of all funds going directly to 13 charitable projects in six countries. \nGreen Globe certification of Club Med’s resorts is as an ongoing program for continuous improvement in sustainable operations and management. The Green Globe Standard is internationally recognized as the most rigorous and independently audited certification program for travel and tourism. With the majority of Club Med Resorts already certified, Green Globe continues to work in partnership to bring independent verification to all properties. \nAbout Green Globe Certification \nGreen Globe is the worldwide sustainability system based on internationally-accepted criteria for sustainable operation and management of travel and tourism businesses.
