The visitor still has to punch a button on the desk and type in information on a touch panel screen. \nFrom its front desk to the porter, which is an automated trolley, this hotel in southwestern Japan - aptly named the Weird Hotel - is \"manned\" almost entirely by robots to save on labour costs. \nHideo Sawada, who runs the hotel as part of an amusement park, insists using robots is not a gimmick, but a serious effort to use technology and achieve efficiency. \nHenn na Hotel, as it is called in Japanese, was shown to reporters on Wednesday, complete with robot demonstrations, ahead of its opening to the public on Friday. \nA receptionist robot performs during a demonstration for the media at the new hotel.

Robots aren't good at finding keys if people happen to lose them. \nStaying at Henn na Hotel starts at Â¥9000 yen (NZ$110), a bargain for Japan, where a stay in one of the nicer hotels can easily cost twice or three times as much. \nThe concierge is a doll-like hairless robot with voice recognition that prattles breakfast and event information. It cannot call a cab or do other errands. \nOne area Henn na Hotel still relies on human beings is security. \nThe place is dotted with security cameras, and real people are watching everything through a monitor to make sure guests stay safe and no one makes off with one of the expensive robots. \n\"And they still can't make beds,\" said Sawada, who has also engineered the rise of a popular affordable Japanese travel agency. \nHe has big ambitions for his robot hotel concept and wants to open another one soon in Japan and later abroad. He is also eager to add other languages, such as Chinese and Korean, to the robots' vocabulary. \nFrom the receptionist that does the check-in and check-out to the porter that's a stand-on-wheels taking luggage up to the room, the hotel, that is run as part of Huis Ten Bosch amusement park, is \"manned\" almost totally by robots to save labour costs.

There are no switches on the walls. \nA receptionist dinosaur robot.
