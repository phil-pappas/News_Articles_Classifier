It's a floating world: houses built on stilts over the water, lush gardens made of reed mats topped with soil and tied to bamboo poles. We sped around the lake in a motorised long-tail canoe. But the local Intha fishermen are more traditional: they stand on one leg in the stern of their shallow wooden skiffs, wrap the other leg about a single oar and row across the lake at a fast clip, pulling in their nets while perfectly balanced. And not in circles either. \nWe took the kids skiing last weekend, and while we missed the snow back home, we were lucky enough to catch just a beautiful little bit of it in Queenstown. It felt just like we were walking through a Christmas movie set! Full credit to the kidlets for sitting still on the frozen bench for long enough for me to get a photo :-) \nWatching the older students train early in the morning at the Shaolin kungfu temple in China. Midflip. \nAfter hiking through Siuslaw National Forest for around an hour and a half, Kentucky falls is a wonderful spot to cool off in the freezing cold water of the swimming hole before trekking back to the car park. \nThe picture was take from atop the amphitheatre at the ancient Greco-Roman and Byzantine city of Hierapolis near Pamukkale in Turkey. The picture doesn't show the hot springs and mineral terraces, which Pamukkale is more famous for. \nA week in Hoi An, Vietnam was the highlight of our trip despite being the end of the rainy season. So much of Hoi An life is summed up in this picture. The buildings painted a bright yellow contrasting so well with the weathering and mildew seen here. The locals undeterred by the incessant rain carried on with their day to day lives. This lady managed to maintain her footing on the slippery cobbled path while carrying her heavy load of produce in the traditional baskets. Her hat, a must have for rain or sun in these parts, and the trusty bicycle waiting for it's rider to return complete the picture. \nLost on our unreliable and underpowered motorcycles in South Vietnam. Heading to Delat from Saigon but ended up a bit close to Cambodia \nWe spent an amazing weekend in Tekapo recently where we included a trip to complete the Hooker walk out to Mt Cook. The weather was terrible and this photo shows my partner Caitlin struggling to see the peak! \nTaking in the view of Lake Moraine in Banff National Park, Canada. Water is the Bluest of Blues and pure coming straight from the glaciers. This beauty is only accessible in the summer season. 1 of 9 « Previous « Previous Next » Next » \nThis week's travel photo entries take us from the lakes of Myanmar a National Forest in the US and feature everything waterfalls to kungfu students. \nDo you have a holiday snap that you'd like to share with the world? \nSend it to us and be in to win a Panasonic camera!
