There should be more to conferences than conference rooms, and that’s why at Four Seasons Resort Whistler, the expert planning and catering team work with groups to turn every event into something memorable.\nEach unique journey begins with a scenic and exhilarating helicopter ride to a secluded destination. Distinctive team-building exercises can be customised to each group. Explore ice caves on an alpine snowmobile adventure, practice golf drives on the mountain, or dine al fresco next to a remote hot spring.\nWilderness Wellness Hot Springs Experience: The journey includes a helicopter ride over the Pemberton Ice Cap before arriving at a remote natural hot spring. Upon arrival, guests are greeted by a master yoga instructor and a Four Seasons Spa therapist to enjoy a private yoga session, followed by an aqua massage treatment. The experience includes thermal poolside cuisine and cocktails prepared by a Four Seasons Chef de Cuisine.\nIce Cap Adventure and Exploration: Transportation begins via helicopter over expansive ice fields, after which guests will explore the vast Ice Caves with a private guide. The guide will lead guests through natural aqua blue ice sculptures, ice flows and gentle slides transporting groups from one cave to the next. The adventure ends with a Four Seasons gourmet mountain-style lunch.\nHeli-Snowmobile and Snowbike Adventure: The adventure starts with a helicopter flight that drops guests off to a base facility where state-of-the-art snowmobiles and snowbikes await. From there, expert guides will teach travellers about the terrain as they race at 8,000 feet (2,400 metres) above sea level. The adventure ends with a Four Seasons gourmet lunch. For the ultimate “first tracks” experience, the snowmobiles can be outfitted with ski racks for skiers who want to partake in backcountry glacier skiing.\nSource:-Four Seasons\nRelated Posts Express your love this Valentine’s Day at Calabash Cove Resort & Spa 40% reduction in room rates in Grand Hyatt Taipei in July and August Four Seasons Resort and Residences Jackson Hole named #1 in wyoming and receives gold badge status in U.S. news & world report’s best hotels 2015 rankings Lisa Lewis Joins Associated Luxury Hotels As National Sales Manager In The U.S. West Region Four Seasons Resort and Residences Jackson Hole Introduces New Summer Mountain Wellness Experience", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T20:04:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
