DeCamp Changes are coming to Ohio State University's Don Scott Field. The Ohio State University Airport is in line for significant improvements that will benefit aviation students and corporate customers thanks to a $10 million gift from a noted OSU benefactor. The Austin E. Knowlton Foundation made the donation to upgrade education and research facilities, including new flight simulators at the airport, also known as Don Scott Field. The gift also will help pay for a new terminal, plus new and renovated hangars, as part of a larger planning and fundraising effort to set the future of the facility, whose buildings are mostly more than 50 years old. “(The airport) is going to look very different,” said David Williams , dean of the OSU College of Engineering, which houses the school’s aviation program. Ohio State said it will begin sharing its vision for the airport with community and corporate leaders in the next few months. Williams said the modernization will benefit the growing number of students in aviation-related fields at Ohio State, as well as the business community that bases planes there. “We haven’t invested in any improvements (there) in quite awhile,” he told me. “... We have some very good business partners that we hope to treat better than we have in the past.” Area companies that use Don Scott include Cardinal Health Inc., Worthington Industries Inc., Advanced Drainage Systems Inc., DLZ, IBM and NetJets. NetJets, in fact, also has been generous to the airport, committing $3 million to go toward establishing and funding the Center for Aviation Studies at the school. Williams cited that as the kind of “symbiotic relationship” OSU wants to build with corporate clients, as NetJets helps train and educate Ohio State students, and then Ohio State graduates potential workers for NetJets. The school said the center has about 2,000 square feet for classrooms, simulators and one-on-one instruction space, but it needs at least twice that to meet demand. It said more than 500 students a year pursue aviation degrees, train for pilot certifications, and perform federally funded research. The OSU airport opened in 1942, and was named Don Scott Field the following year to honor a former All-American athlete who died in a bomber crash in England that year. Williams said Ohio State is one of only three big research universities in the country that have their own airports, along with Purdue and Texas A&M, giving it an advantage as it looks to grow the aviation program. The gift from the Knowlton Foundation follows on a $16 million donation from the OSU alum and Knowlton Construction Co. founder that helped pay for the new home of what was renamed the Knowlton School of Architecture on campus. “Dutch Knowlton was a pioneer in using aircraft to support and grow his many business interests,” Knowlton Foundation trustee Eric Lindberg said in a statement. “Although he was best known for his construction company and ownership in the Cincinnati Bengals and Reds, he had a lifetime passion for aviation. He acquired a Beech dealership and began using business aircraft to travel between construction sites in the 1960s, later operating an air charter company and multiple Learjets and helicopters from the 1970s – and he remained an avid Learjet fan until the end of his life, always outfitting his airplanes in his signature emerald and white livery.” OSU said the airport has an economic impact topping $157 million a year, according to a 2012 study it commissioned . “Ohio State’s airport is an important economic development asset for the Columbus region,” Columbus 2020 Chief Economic Officer Kenny McDonald said in the gift’s announcement. “The aerospace research and pilot training conducted at the OSU Airport brings new dollars into the area and prepares students for great careers in the industry. It also serves as a gateway to the Columbus region for many important visitors and companies and provides significant benefits for the surrounding communities.” \nWant Columbus Travel  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T15:04:08.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
