Disney offered no other comment. \nThe removal of the statute at Disney’s Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame Plaza came after court documents unsealed on Monday revealed that Cosby testified in 2005 that he’d obtained quaaludes with the intent of giving them to women he wanted to have sex with. \nThe 77-year-old Cosby hasn’t commented on the documents, which were secret for a decade until Monday, after The Associated Press went to court to get them released. He has never been charged with a crime and has repeatedly denied sexual assault allegations.
