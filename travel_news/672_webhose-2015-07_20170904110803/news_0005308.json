Evans Hotels immediately initiated an investigation and engaged a leading computer security firm to examine its payment system. \nDuring the investigation, it was learned that when large groups were checking-in front desk clerks occasionally used card readers kept on hand as a backup after new card readers were installed several years ago. Upon discovering this, Evans Hotels immediately removed the backup readers from all of its properties on March 5, 2015. As the investigation progressed, indicators were found that malware had been installed on the computers at the front desks of Evans Hotels' properties that could have captured data from cards that were swiped using the backup readers between September 2014 and March 5, 2015. \nThe information that may have been affected included the cardholder name, account number, expiration date and verification code. Most cards used during this time frame were swiped through readers that encrypt card data and were not affected by this incident. \nBecause of the nature of the incident, Evans Hotels was unable to specifically identify the small percentage of guests whose cards were swiped through the backup readers. If you used a card at any Evans Hotels properties between September 2014 and March 5, 2015, we recommend that you regularly review your account statements for any unauthorized activity. Contact the bank that issued your card if you see any unauthorized charges. The credit card companies typically guarantee that cardholders will not be responsible for fraudulent charges. You should also review the additional information below on ways to protect yourself. \nTo help prevent this from happening again, Evans Hotels not only removed the backup readers from its properties, but is also working with a computer security firm to implement additional enhanced security measures. Evans Hotels' payment system has been fully remediated. You can feel confident in using your card at all Evans Hotels' properties. \nEvans Hotels regrets any inconvenience or concern this may have caused.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T21:23:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
