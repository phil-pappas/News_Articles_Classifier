Johan Van Overtveldt insists, however, that the door remains open to resume talks with the Greek government \"literally, within hours.\"He told VRT network on Sunday that the eurogroup of 19 finance ministers can again discuss measures \"that can put the Greek economy back on track and gives the Greeks a perspective for the future.\"Greeks voted on its financial future, choosing in a referendum whether to accept creditors' demands for more austerity in return for rescue loans or defiantly reject the deal. Final results are expected later Sunday. ___ 8:50 p.m. A government-backed \"no\" in Greece's bailout referendum is set to win by 61 percent, according to an official projection by the country's Interior Ministry. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras halted negotiations with creditors to hold the vote and seek a popular rejection of austerity measures. But European officials have warned a \"no\" vote could risk Greece's membership of the euro. The projected margin late Sunday was higher than originally indicated by polling date when the polls closed at 7 p.m. (1600 GMT). ___ 8:40 p.m. Of the first 20 percent of votes counted in Greece's referendum on whether to accept more austerity in exchange for a bailout, 60 percent voted \"no\" and 40 percent voted \"yes.\"Three opinions polls, however, showed a much tighter race with a three to four percentage point difference between both sides. Greeks voted on Sunday on its financial future, choosing in a referendum whether to accept creditors' demands for more austerity in return for rescue loans or defiantly reject the deal. Final results are expected later Sunday. 1 of 8", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T22:06:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
