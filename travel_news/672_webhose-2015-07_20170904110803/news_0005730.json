This was a free event and locals as well as visitors enjoyed all that was on offer. The event organisation was superb and we look to be well on target to reaping the economic windfall of around £10 million that we had hoped for.\n“Yet again, Belfast has been showcased on an international stage and proved it punches well above its weight when it comes to staging world class events,” he added.\nThe 46 stunning Tall Ships berthed in Belfast included some from as far away as Brazil and Ecuador as well as many from Scandanavia and other international ports.\nBrazilian vessel, The Cisne Branco, welcomed 32,000 visitors on board during its Belfast stay – the highest number it has recorded anywhere in the world.\nCrews highlighted Belfast as one of the most welcoming host ports ever and Sail Training International indicated they would be keen to return to Belfast for a fourth time in the years ahead.\nAll of the Tall Ships are now sailing across the North Sea on their way to Alesund in Norway.\nRelated Posts Dublin celebrates its towering literary figure Chelsea Football Club Hosts Leaders Sport Summit 2013, the world’s most Prestigious Sport Business Summit Tourism Ireland is Tops For Digital Marketing, According to New Report Are redundancies ‘a normal part of business’?
