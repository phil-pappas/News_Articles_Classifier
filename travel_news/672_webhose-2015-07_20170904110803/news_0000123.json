New theme park Snow Town is, literally, one of the coolest places in town 10 Jul 2015 at 03:29 22 viewed 0 comments NEWSPAPER SECTION: GURU | WRITER: KASIDIT SRIVILAI - + The infernal heat that has blanketed Bangkok's so-called rainy season over the past few weeks means that even the air-conditioning systems in shopping malls aren't enough to keep Bangkokians from sweating profusely. And we have the underarm rings on our shirts to prove it. \nThe exception, however, is Gateway Ekamai, where the Japanese-style snow theme park, Snow Town, has recently arrived. There's no longer a need therefore for us to just hang around those uber-trendy malls pretending to be interested in expensive items on display, when all we really want is to escape from the heat. \nAt Snow Town, be surrounded by refreshingly cool air and scenes of a romantic frosty town that conjures images of strolling on the roadside of Sapporo in winter (minus the frostbite). \nWith around 3,000m², located on the fifth floor of Gateway, the Euro-Japanese style Snow Town claims to be the first snow theme park in Southeast Asia. You have to wonder what Dream World has to say about that and whether Harbin Ice Wonderland is fit to fight for that claim. \nThis chilly theme park is currently offering two promotional packages — pay B100 just to stroll around a lovely village full of Japanese restaurants, or cough up B200 to enter the snow-covered ground and enjoy feathery snowflakes (snowfakes?). Snow boots are also available for rent for those who choose the second option, but if you're here for photo ops, feel free to bring your own fancy boots you've bought and hardly ever have a chance to wear. We know you have them. \nThe boots aren't the only accessories you can wear. While you're at it, you can get a sliding board, a glittery jacket or even a pair of pink furry ear muffs to add a little \"kawaii\" to your outfit. But, ahem, all of them are for a rental price so high that you could almost buy your own at the shops outside. \nFor those who want to dust up their skiing skills, Snow Town also offers private courses for B1,200 per hour. \nEven those who aren't into the idea of snowy selfies can still enjoy this place, thanks to the food on offer. Snow Town is loaded with plenty of Hokkaido-imported restaurants and cafes that serve mouth-watering Japanese treats, from ramen with full-flavoured stock soup to Hokkaido's famous jengiskhan beef. Snow Town even allows you to dine on ice and enjoy your hot meal while letting white man-made ice flakes fall onto your head. If you're not a fan of Japanese food, however, your stomach might just have to keep growling here. \nWhat surprised me most about this place, however, is the temperature inside. A place with the word \"snow\" in it is expected to be freezing, but here the weather is just cool, not cold. Actually, it's probably around 20C inside, meaning some offices in Bangkok are even colder. There's no need to layer yourself up with cashmere and fur — a T-shirt and a pair of jeans is fine, unless you want to slide down the low-lying snowy hill. Or you can dress up as Elsa — that would probably fit the occasion as well. \nSince it's spanking new, being opened just last week, brace for big crowds of kids and their parents. This is a great place for families — parents can let their children have fun with the snow, while dining nearby. And there's no entrance fee for a child under 120cm. G \nSnow Town is located on 5/F Gateway Ekamai. It opens at 11am-10pm on Mon-Thu, until midnight on Fri-Sat and 10am-10pm on Sun. Visit fb.com/snowtownbangkok or www.snowtown.co.th for more details.
