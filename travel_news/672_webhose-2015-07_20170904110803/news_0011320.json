Organisers hope some of the WRTD event will help inform debate at the UN conference. \nThe French event is hoping to succeed where the previous event held in 2009 in Copenhagen failed, by reaching a global consensus on how best to reduce greenhouse gas emissions so that the global temperature increase is limited to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. \nWRTD will start with a keynote address from Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change in the school of mechanical, aerospace and civil engineering at the University of Manchester. \nHe is also the deputy director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research and advises the Prime Minister’s office on carbon trading. \nFollowing his keynote address there will be a panel debate, chaired by BBC journalist Stephen Sackur, which will see the pair joined by senior travel industry executives to discuss how the travel industry can help in the reduction of greenhouse gasses. \nThe afternoon’s content concludes with the carbon debate, which will see the motion “The tourism industry could do much more to take responsibility for reducing carbon emissions” contested. \nWTM senior director Simon Press said: “The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris has the potential to have a significant impact on the travel industry. \n“With WTM taking place weeks before the conference we can help set the agenda by discussing climate change and the role the travel industry can play. Anderson is a highly-respected speaker and will present a thought-provoking, controversial and potentially worrying picture of where the world is on tackling climate change.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T13:10:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
