But decades of neglect under military rule and conflict still raging in parts of the country's remote north and east have left many of its officially recognised 135 minority groups on the fringes. \nExtremist clergy members are at the vanguard of moves to marginalise these minorities, especially Muslims. \nWell-organised Buddhist nationalist movements such as Ma Ba Tha - which is closely allied to Wirathu's 969 movement - prints regular journals that reach tens of thousands of readers. \nSilent politicians \nSuch groups say they are fighting to protect the interests of the country's Bamar majority. \nThe tend to portray Islam as external invasion that will wipe out Myanmar's Buddhist heritage despite the fact that Muslims have existed in the country for centuries. \nPamaukha, a monk and spokesman for Ma Ba Tha, denied the group caused anti-Muslim violence, saying it was only \"working hard\" to ensure Myanmar \"does not become an Islamic country\". \nFew mainstream politicians - including opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi - dare speak out in defence of Muslims for fear of alienating Buddhist voters ahead of crucial elections. \nHer reticence, especially on the Rohingya issue, has earned her international opprobrium. \nBut Buddhist nationalists are actively campaigning against Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy party because it has spoken out against the Buddhist \"protection laws\" put forward to parliament by Ma Ba Tha. \n\"We will campaign not to vote (for the NLD or others opposing the laws) through speeches and pamphlets,\" said Pamaukha. \nThe smiling subjects of the \"My Friend\" campaign on Facebook know they have a long way to go. Their campaign has garnered only around 1,700 likes on Facebook, a figure dwarfed by the more than 74,000 subscribers on Wirathu's page. \nBut they still hope their message of friendship gains traction as the country prepares to head to the polls. \nAs Han Seth Lu, a recent contributor to the campaign's Facebook page, put it in a post showing him standing alongside a woman in hijab: \"I'm Buddhist and my friend is a Muslim.\" \n\"We are different but we accept each other,\" he added. \"Because friendship has no boundaries\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T22:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T22:27:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
