We are proud that year after year, our people have generously provided their time and resources and donated financially to such important causes.”\nIn addition to the efforts of Etihad Airways’ employees, the disaster response initiative also included the provision of food, water, clothing, tents, medical kits and other items, delivered through the UAE Red Crescent to Kathmandu and surrounding areas.\nThe airline flew over 52 emergency relief workers and items from the US, Europe, and Australia to Kathmandu through Airlink, a global agency which coordinates airline partners to provide support in emergency situations and provided over 5,000 blankets.\nTo date, 10,000kg of excess baggage for relief items has been provided on special request free-of-charge to passengers who are travelling to Nepal.\nEtihad Guest, Etihad Airways’ award-winning loyalty program, also established a dedicated page on the donations section of its Etihad Guest Reward Shop website and invited its members around the world to support the cause by contributing their miles. As a result, over 30 million miles were donated by Etihad Guest members.\nSource:-Ethiad Airways", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T13:56:15.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
