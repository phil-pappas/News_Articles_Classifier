EAA AirVenture Oshkosh, the world’s largest aviation fly-in and annual convention, runs from July 20-26. \nEvery summer, hundreds of thousands of people converge on Oshkosh, population 66,000, for a weeklong celebration of all things aviation that attracts everyone from hard-core flight enthusiasts to people just curious about things with wings. Count my family in the latter category. \nSurrounded by more than 2,600 show planes of all types — ultralights, homebuilts, vintage planes, warbirds, aerobatic craft, hot air balloons, etc. — and with daily air shows, concerts, movies, forums and more, my husband, children and I quickly caught the fervour during a two-day visit. \nWe helped build a plane. OK, we each pulled one rivet as part of the “One Week Wonder” project. But by the end of the week, there was a small plane flying around with our rivets in the left wing, which we’d autographed with a black Sharpie. \nThis year, volunteers will be able to help build aircraft wings that will be shipped to Experimental Aircraft Association chapters around the U.S., where planes will be assembled. \nOn a visit to “Warbird Alley,” we clambered through one of the last B-17s built for World War II. Nearby, a living history encampment featured tents, equipment and vehicles. \nEager to get up in the air, my kids took a spin over the convention grounds in a vintage Bell 47G helicopter ($49 US each). \nIn the KidVenture hangar, kids can try flight simulators, and volunteers lead hands-on lessons in assembling engines, building wings and more. Even my teenager got into it. \nA shuttle bus takes people the 10 km to the Experimental Aircraft Association’s Seaplane Base on Lake Winnebago, where nearly 100 seaplanes gathered last year. \nFor hours every afternoon, there is an air show that by itself is worth a visit. There are also two nighttime air shows with fireworks. In 2014, the Air Force Thunderbirds were the biggest attraction. This year, the big draws will include the F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Lightning II, the first time the latter fighter jet has been at a civilian airshow. And a B-52 bomber will be on display all week. \nAlso on this year’s schedule: Nightly outdoor concerts and aviation-themed movies. A concert by Dierks Bentley (an avid pilot) on opening night, and by Gary Sinise and the Lt. Dan Band as the finale to the July 24 salute to veterans. Both concerts are free with admission to the show. \nFor true aviators, there are all sorts of guest forums on topics like “rigging your own Cessna,”“aluminum gas welding 101,” and “dual engine loss in mountains.” That last one was a reminder that flying is serious business. \nHow does little Oshkosh — perhaps best known as headquarters for the OshKosh B’Gosh clothing company — accommodate the half-million-plus visitors who attend AirVenture? Thousands fly in and set up housekeeping in tents parked next to their planes. Wittman Regional Airport, adjacent to the EAA grounds, becomes the world’s busiest airport for the week, with an estimated 20,000 takeoffs and landings. \nThe fly-in campers turn the convention scene into an instant village with morning aerobics, church services, outdoor restaurants, even a daily newspaper. \nNEED TO KNOW \n— EAA Air Venture Oshkosh runs July 20-26, in Oshkosh, Wisc.
