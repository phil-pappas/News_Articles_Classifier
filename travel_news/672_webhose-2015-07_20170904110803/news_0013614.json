The project is scheduled to open in the second half of 2016. Through its status as an independently-owned Minority Business Enterprise (MBE), R&R Resources+ will be charged with a specific focus on diversity marketing, corporate social responsibility and workforce strategy, assisting MGM Resorts International (MGM) in developing authentic minority outreach and partnerships in the capital region. MGM National Harbor joins the R&R Resources+ portfolio of clients, which include American Gaming Association, PCI Security Standards Council and Liberty Natural Gas. As a minority investor in R&R Resources+, R&R Partners will also join the MGM National Harbor project, bringing its unique brand of travel and tourism expertise, which produced the iconic \"What happens here, stays here\" campaign for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. R&R Partners is also MGM's media agency of record and manages branding for the company's M Life customer rewards program. Horsford's fully staffed team of professionals specialize in strategic communications, brand management, public relations, social media, media planning and placement, as well as workforce strategy and corporate social responsibility. The firm will maintain offices in Prince George's County, Maryland ; Washington, DC ; and Las Vegas, Nevada . Helping to lead this talented team in the Washington DC office is Piper Overstreet , Horsford's business partner in R&R Resources+. Overstreet previously served as a government affairs executive for MGM Resorts International and as district representative for U.S. Congresswoman Shelley Berkley . As principal of her own consulting firm, she represented clients in the U.S., the Bahamas , Singapore and Macau . Also joining the firm as Of Counsel, is Jill Warren , who previously worked with the Patriot Group and served as assistant attorney general and policy director for the Office of the Attorney General of Texas John Cornyn. Warren has worked to advance issues in aviation and energy, and has helped to position foreign governments including Chad , South Sudan and Indonesia before influencers in the United States. R&R Resources+ represents the most recent example of Horsford's long dedication to public service. He began his career in government affairs two decades ago at R&R Partners and went on to become CEO of Nevada's largest workforce agency, the Culinary Academy of Las Vegas. During his 10 years with this organization, he handled recruitment and training for thousands of workers in the Las Vegas hospitality industry. He was elected to the Nevada State Legislature, where he became the first African-American majority leader in the state Senate's history and in 2012, and he marked another milestone as the first African-American elected to the U.S. Congress representing the State of Nevada . Horsford launched his communications company, Resources+, in early 2015, before taking on R&R Partners as a minority investor. \"MGM is a model corporate citizen that is fully committed to a diverse workforce,\" said Horsford. \"Throughout my career, I have supported this philosophy, that diversity and equal opportunity are critical to a thriving marketplace. It is gratifying to find myself back where it all started, working in partnership with the R&R Partners team to advocate for the kind of best practices that all of corporate America should embrace. Creating R&R Resources+ has been the ideal platform for this.\" 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T02:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T04:02:01.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
