The club is also directly linked to two five-star hotels, The Saujana Hotel Kuala Lumpur and The Club Saujana Resort. \n\nAs the newest listing in European Tour Destinations, Saujana Golf & Country Club will benefit from the network's year-round sales, marketing and operational support, joining the 14 existing members in the European Tour Properties’ portfolio of world-class venues. \n\nDavid MacLaren, director of property and venue development at The European Tour, said: “We have a long-standing relationship with the owners of Saujana Golf & Country Club and one which is very important to The European Tour. Announcing Saujana as our official European Tour Destination in Malaysia is a natural extension of this association and will allow us to further develop our partnership into many new spheres.” \n\nArokia Das, senior manager at Luxury Tours Malaysia, said: “Being named in the Tour programme puts Malaysia on the world golf map. It will attract more foreign golfers to visit Malaysia and other golf courses in the country will also benefit because golfers tend to want different experiences on different courses.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T11:41:55.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
