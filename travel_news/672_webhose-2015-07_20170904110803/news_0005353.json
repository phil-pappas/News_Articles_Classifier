BASQUE BASH IN IDAHO Held once every five years, Jaialdi , a celebration of Basque culture, will feature traditional weight-lifting competitions, dance performances and sheep wagon displays in Boise, Idaho, July 28 to Aug. 2. Idaho is home to one of the largest populations of Basque descendants outside of Europe, many of whose ancestors were drawn to the state’s sheep ranches. Basque musicians scheduled to perform range from traditional singers to modern rockers. Some of the quirkier exhibitions at the quinquennial fest involve farm-skills-based contests featuring stone lifters, wood choppers and ox cart carriers, which will showcase top athletes from the Basque region of Spain.
