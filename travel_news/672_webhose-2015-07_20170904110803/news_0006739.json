Ravell Call, Deseret News Enlarge photo» Summary \nThe Utah Transit Authority is allowing passengers taking buses or trains to the Days of ’47 Komatsu Equipment Rodeo to ride free of charge using their rodeo ticket as fare. \nSALT LAKE CITY — Rodeo fans enjoying the Pioneer Day festivities can catch a free ride on TRAX this week. \nThe Utah Transit Authority is allowing passengers taking buses or trains to the Days of ’47 Komatsu Equipment Rodeo to ride free of charge using their rodeo ticket as fare. The event runs Tuesday through Saturday at EnergySolutions Arena with plaza events beginning at 4 p.m. and the rodeo starting at 7 p.m. \nFrontRunner riders can access the event by connecting to the TRAX Green Line at North Temple Station or the TRAX Blue Line at Salt Lake Central Station. The agency noted that the rodeo ticket could be used as UTA fare on the event date only. \nRodeo tickets can be used as fare on FrontRunner, TRAX, the S-Line and local buses and are valid as fare for the entire day of the event, explained UTA spokesman Remi Barron. Passengers may also show a Flash Seats reservation or printed ticket confirmation receipt as proof of fare, he added. \nOn Pioneer Day, UTA will offer Saturday FrontRunner, TRAX and S-Line service and Sunday bus service, while bus route 667, which connects riders from Farmington Station to Lagoon in Davis County, will operate on a Saturday schedule on the holiday. \nUTA also reminds eventgoers that groups of four people traveling to holiday events can save money with a UTA Group Pass, which allows up to four riders to make a round trip on local buses, TRAX, FrontRunner and the S-Line for $10. Group passes are available at UTA customer service locations, ticket vending machines and online. \nFor more information on the holiday transit schedule, visit UTA's www.rideuta.com .
