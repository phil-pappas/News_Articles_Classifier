There are fans around Australia who will be equally excited about watching their grassroots club take on an A-League team at a suburban ground like Leichhardt Oval or ABD Stadium in Melbourne as they were watching Read Madrid and Manchester City in front of 100,000 fans in the biggest stadium in Australia.\n“Football has once again shown that it is not only the football code that has true international appeal, but it is also the only sport that connects the grassroots with the professionals in a meaningful competition played in the country’s biggest stadiums as well as local grounds in the suburbs.”\nLast week it was the powerhouses of Real Madrid and Manchester City, this week the ‘suburban stars’are on display.
