I'd also like to go to Tibet in China.\"\nGoncalves says he has a dream of collecting window photos from every country, but concedes: \"It will take a long time.\"\nHe adds: \"Sometimes I'm just walking with my girlfriend and I'm, like, 'whoa -- look at that window.' This is like an addiction.\"\nSee more of Goncalves work on his website", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T13:05:16.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
