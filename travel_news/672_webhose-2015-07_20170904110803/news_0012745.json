It’s hot. Instead of hunkering in a cosy kitchen, the smell of warm chocolate cake emanating from the oven, you’re more likely to want to have the back door and the windows flung open. Pudding is usually a bowlful of fresh fruit – cherries, raspberries, perfectly ripe peaches – rather than a pie. But some of the loveliest sweet treats of the summer require a bit of oven action. It’s all about starting with the most familiar building blocks. I stick to a limited repertoire – for which I don’t even have to find the recipes – and decorate, fill and embellish the results with all the fruit and flowers that are around. The most beautiful, abundant and flamboyant desserts can start with baking basics. If you can make meringues, a simple cake (such as a Victoria sandwich) and a pastry case, you have the perfect canvases. Cakes can be filled with a mixture of mascarpone and cream (beat 50g mascarpone with a wooden spoon to loosen it, whip 50ml double cream until it holds its shape, then combine and sweeten with icing sugar). A meringue served with berries and cream has a restrained beauty You can also add a layer of lemon or orange curd (I use Duchy Originals from Waitrose Curd if I don’t have home-made. Three to four big tablespoons is about the right amount). Add raspberries or strawberries, too, making sure that you’re generous – the fruit should be tumbling out the sides – then dust the top with icing sugar. Baked apricots – cook them with sugar, vanilla and a little white wine – also make a fabulous filling, especially if you add a good dollop of amaretto to the cream. The same creamy mixture of mascarpone and whipped cream can be spread in a tart case and topped with a mixture of berries (including little sprigs of redcurrants) before being dusted with icing sugar; or go pale and beautiful, and use only white currants (it’s like serving up a tart full of glowing pearls). Meringues are a boon. They’re light and cloud-like, and much more suited to summer than winter eating. They call for tartness, so raspberries, redcurrants and gooseberries are all brilliant with them, and they don’t have to be blousy and old-fashioned. A big plain meringue served in a broad flat soup plate with berries and whipped cream mixed with elderflower cordial or ground cardamom and rosewater (and decorated with flower petals) has a restrained beauty. Or take the opposite approach and make three discs of meringue, each one decreasing in size, and create a gorgeous turret of meringue and fruit. The important thing is to stick to a limited palette of colour. Go for red berries or slices of golden stone fruits, and use an appropriate flavouring in the cream (crème de cassis for berries, amaretto or marsala for nectarines and peaches). If you don’t want to go to the trouble of lining a tart case, just make a free-form tart. Roll out your pastry on a metal baking sheet, sprinkle the base with some brown sugar and ground almonds or hazelnuts (the nuts soak up the juices) and top with wedges of ripe peach or quartered apricots, leaving a 4cm rim. Carefully fold the pastry rim over the fruit, sprinkle with more sugar and bake. Finally, there’s always crumble. In the summer, I make almond ones (using 75g plain flour, 75g ground almonds, 125g butter and 35g soft light brown sugar, and scatter the top with flaked almonds). Apricots, or a combination of apricots and blueberries, or plain old gooseberries are best with an almond topping. Serve your crumble lukewarm and don’t forget the cream (thick golden Jersey stuff).
