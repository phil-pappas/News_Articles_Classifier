City officials are in the process of awarding an $88,000 engineering contract to convert the embankment into a sloped amphitheater. Advocates say the project will transform an unutilized area at the Great Falls into one of its main attractions.\nThe plans for the Overlook Park section, near the National Park headquarters on the McBride Avenue Extension, are taking shape as work nears completion on a major landscaping project on the north shore of the Great Falls in the area known as Mary Ellen Kramer Park.\n“When this is done, both sides of the falls will be all new,” said Darren Boch, superintendent of the national park.\n“This is going to tie everything together,” said Mayor Jose “Joey” Torres. “This is another piece of the puzzle.\"\nTorres had pushed for the creation of an amphitheater at the Overlook location during his first stint as mayor almost 10 years ago. But many park initiatives had been placed on hold because of the uncertainty at the time over whether the Great Falls would be a state or national park.\nTorres initially envisioned a concrete amphitheater on the embankment. Now, he said, it will be made of landscaped grass.\nThe Overlook project will represent the federal government’s first investment towards capital improvements at the Great Falls. The National Park Service is providing about $250,000 towards the work. The rest of the money will come from the Passaic County open space program, which has allocated more than $750,000 for the Overlook improvements.\nThe federal government’s funding for the park became a point of controversy last week when a preliminary report showed the Park Service would provide less than 10 percent of the money for capital improvements at the Great Falls.\nIn addition to the amphitheater, the Overlook project also will include the reconstruction of the visitors’ parking lot on McBride Avenue Extension.\nMeanwhile, officials said the grand-opening of the renovated Mary Ellen Kramer Park, a $1.8 million project that used county open space and state Green Acres funds, will take place before the end of the summer.", "external_links": ["http://northjersey.mycapture.com/mycapture/lookup.asp?originalname=MC_great", "http://northjersey.mycapture.com/mycapture/lookup.asp?originalname=MC_GreatFalls_)41715.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-14T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T23:24:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
