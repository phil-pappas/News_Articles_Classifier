You find it on one of the best beaches in the world tourists could imagine to travel to. \nLook at Four Twenty South Latitude on Kenya's Diana Galu beach, a true travel insider tip. Luciana Parazzi, Director of Colobus Conservation, is into conservation of forests and wildlife in general and when she travels, she likes to be in a friendly atmosphere where there is peace and tranquility. On a trip to Kenya, she stayed at Four Twenty South and nominated the property to be added to THE LIST, the eTN Award for excellence in tourism. \nSo taken by her stay, she was compelled to write to eTurboNews in which she had this to say about the property. “Simple but beautiful, surrounded by gardens and facing the magnificent Diani Beach. Excellent food and great hosts. Had a very relaxing weekend, surrounded by nature and did great goggling ... and over ate!!!!” \neTN publisher Juergen T. Steinmetz said of the nomination: “Four Twenty’ South is the kind of place that touches guests so much, that they are compelled to write about it and share their enthusiasm with others. While I have not yet had the privilege of staying there myself, it certainly appears to be a place that should be on one’s bucket list. So many of us are so busy when we travel, and this is just the kind of place to go, to truly be on vacation and unwind. We are pleased to add them to THE LIST. Congratulations!\" \nSo how does one make it on THE LIST? Anyone can nominate a hotel, destination, attraction, airline, person, cruise, or restaurant based on a best moment or experience. THE LIST is not about rating how “luxurious” something is. It is more about how much something is appreciated or different. \n“We are absolutely thrilled to be on the list for ourselves and also for Kenya’s Diani/Galu beach. It's Africa’s most beautiful beach. This is an honor for us and a boost for tourism and the residents of Kwale District after suffering major setbacks in the last few years. Thank you so much; we really appreciate it,” said Hilary Martin, General Manager of Four° Twenty’ South, named for the latitude – it is almost exactly 4 degrees and 20 minutes south of the equator. \nThe property is made up of six characterful beachfront houses, stylish but simple, fully staffed with a personal chef and housekeeper on Kenya’s south coast, Diani/Galu beach. Diani has been voted as one of the best 25 beaches in the world by Trip Advisor. Galu is an extension of Diani’s powder white sands but less developed. \nFour° Twenty’ South aims to offer the privacy and freedom of a guest’s own home (without the chores) in peaceful tropical gardens on the shores of the sparkling sapphire Indian Ocean where one may be awoken by monkeys jumping on the roof or by the cry of a bushbaby in the night, but not to worry as the waves kissing the shore will lull guests back to sleep. Those staying on property decide when and what to eat, and what beauty treatments, excursions, or activities they desire. \n“Good food is important to us. Fresh seafood is brought to the door daily by the neighboring fishermen, and our chefs are skilled in preparing it. Mangoes, paw paw, watermelon, and passion fruit, along with some seasonal vegetables are also brought to the door by a ‘bicycle shop’ (as one of our guests called the local vendors),” said Martin. \nThe houses have been renovated but retain their colonial character and are simply furnished with a stylish mix of British and Swahili furniture all locally produced. It provides an authentic old-fashioned beach holiday experience which is far removed from that of a modern beach resort. \nThe business has been run by the family since the 1960s and offers the security of a single property with the privacy of a stand-alone house screened from others by tropical gardens. The owners also live on the property, and some of the staff or their families have worked there for 2 or 3 generations. \nFour airlines now fly in from Nairobi and Four° Twenty’ South offers complimentary transfer at the airstrip which is 7 minutes away, along with a complimentary shopping service where staff can shop from a list in advance or there is a car available by arrangement to take guests shopping for themselves. Alternatively, the chef can do the shopping, and a catered option from the distinctive locally-influenced menu is also available, as a bed and breakfast or as a half or full board, for those who would rather leave the catering decisions to the staff. \nThe Shimba Hills Game Park is a short drive away, while the famous Masai Mara is an easy flight from there. Go to the reef in an ngalawa (local sailing outrigger canoe), snorkel in the coral gardens, walk for miles along the gorgeous unspoiled beach, swim in the warm Indian Ocean, scuba dive, kite surf, wind surf, deep sea fish. There is also a golf course nearby. Do yoga, exercise classes, have a massage, facial, or reflexology in the comfort of “home.” Or just enjoy the beautiful surroundings and relax. At Four° Twenty’ South, guests’ time is their own. \nEmily Lawn, who stayed at the property, wrote: “I have just arrived home to rainy Ireland but am cherishing my memories of a wonderful stay at 420 South. We had such a fantastic stay, and we were all delighted with 420. Our cottage was beautiful and the view magnificent, it was just what the 3 patients needed to recover from their hospital stint! We were so happy with the service provided by you and your staff. Michael was fantastic and we are all lamenting the fact that it will be another while before we get to eat such great food again!! I am sorry that we never made it over for sundowners, but the time just seemed to slip away from us! Many thanks once again, and we will certainly be back!” \nFor more information about Four° Twenty’ South go to www.fourtwentysouth.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T07:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T09:38:19.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
