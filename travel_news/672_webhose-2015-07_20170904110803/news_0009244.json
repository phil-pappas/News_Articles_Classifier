The 500-tonne keel - the bottom of the ship - was ceremoniously lowered into position on keel blocks by crane, so that work can begin to customize the yet-to-be-named ship for the Chinese market. We believe this special ceremony will bring prosperity and good fortune to Princess Cruises and our guests in China Cherry Wang, director of Carnival China More than two million man-hours will go into building the 3,600-passenger ship, which will remain in the building dock until float out next summer. \"We're incredibly excited to mark this step in the ship's construction,\" said Anthony Kaufman, Princess Cruises' senior vice president of Asia operations, who travelled to Italy for the ceremony. \"We're very pleased to be working with our long-term partner, Fincantieri, on our newest ship and we appreciate their partnership and collaboration to customise and tailor the ship for the Chinese market.\" Cherry Wang, director of Carnival China, who also travelled to Italy for the ceremony, said: \"The lion dance has been part of the Chinese culture for thousands of years and is performed on various auspicious occasions and celebrations. \"According to traditional Chinese belief, the lion signifies courage, wisdom, and good fortune and brings happiness, longevity, and good luck.
