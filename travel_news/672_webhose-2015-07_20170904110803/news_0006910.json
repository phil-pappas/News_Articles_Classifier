I go from long to short to super short to blonde highlights to jet black and back to super short. I tell myself it’s only hair. Usually I end up with something I really like. I’m not scared of a little color or a bit of neck showing. \nThis last time though…whoops. I definitely had some switchers remorse. I thought let’s take this shorter. You see my hairstylist a couple weeks previously lightly shaved a hidden strip of hair over my ear. It was cute, subtle but still shocking if I styled it the right way. \nAs it grew in I wanted more shock so instead of going back to her I took it upon myself to shave off MORE. When the clippers made that first pass my eyes got wide and I said “oh well, no turning back now”. I ended up with an almost bald patch. I liked the idea but definitively not the lack of length. \nHere I am a couple weeks later and I’m happy with it. I actually love it. I get compliments all the time especially from people I don’t expect to like it, like my boss or the old maintenance man. \nIt’s just hair but for a good solid 2 weeks I definitely had #SwitchersRemorse. Will I keep this cut and style going, YES. Will I be going that short again, NO. \nAs a member of a very cool team of influencers for Verizon Wireless I received compensation to share this moment of my life when I had #SwitchersRemorse. The story is true though. \nDo you have a story to share about when you were drawn away by the shiny things only to find yourself back to where it started?
