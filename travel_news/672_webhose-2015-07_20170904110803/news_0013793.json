City of the Monkey God/White City, Honduras: Explorers unearthed what they believe to be the ruins of the lost City of the Monkey God, or the White City, in the jungles of Honduras. National Geographic reports that the team found some 52 artifacts at the site, including some carved with the 'were-jaguar,' a part human-jaguar-serpent creature. Read more about the discovery here.

Several cities are believed to have been built upon this site in Turkey and the earliest of these cities, Troy VII, is considered to be the Homeric Troy, though this has been disputed. (Shutterstock) \nTintagel Castle, United Kingdom: Located near the town of Tintagel in Cornwall, these ruins are heavily connected to the legend of King Arthur, with many believing this was his birthplace and his fortress. However, excavators of the site have speculated it was once a Roman fortress or even a Celtic monastery. (Shutterstock) \nPompeii, Italy: Pompeii was destroyed and buried along with its sister city of Herculaneum during the two day eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D. The city was rediscovered in 1748, after being buried for almost 1,700 years, by a Spanish engineer and excavations of the site revealed buildings and artifacts still intact. (Shutterstock) \nAncient City of Vijayanagara, India: This was once the urban centre of the Vijayangara Empire, which ruled southern India until 1646. The city was captured and mostly destroyed in 1565. Excavations have unearthed artifacts dating back to the third century, suggesting the area was populated even before the Empire came into control. (Shutterstock) \nPalmyra, Syria: This city was once an important stop for caravans crossing the Syrian desert, but fell into disuse in the 16th century. The city is known among historians for its large scale funerary art and excavators continue to unearth temples and churches into this millennium. (Shutterstock) \nCarthage, Tunisia: Roman legend paints Carthage as a large, rich city in 814 B.C. Wars resulted in the city's fall, though to this day it remains a popular tourist destination. (Shutterstock) \nMachu Picchu, Peru: This Incan site is located 2,430 metres above sea level in the Peruvian Urubamba Valley. The Incas started building this sky high kingdom around 1460 A.D., but abandoned the site when an epidemic of smallpox hit the area during the time of the Spanish conquest. The city gained worldwide recognition when discovered by American historian Hiram Bingham in 1911. (Shutterstock) \nPetra, Jordan: This New Wonder of the World is renowned for its rock-cut architecture. Built around 100 B.C., the history of Petra is largely unclear, though some feel there are references to it in the Bible's Old Testament. (Shutterstock) \nAngkor, Cambodia: The Angkor Wat temple is one of the last structures remaining in Angkor, the Cambodian city abandoned after an attack by the Thai. Ruins of smaller temples and public spaces remain, but Angkor Wat, with its carvings and multiple floors, is the stunning centrepiece. (Shutterstock) \nAkrotiri, Santorini, Greece: This city was covered by thick layers of ash from a volcanic explosion in the second century, burying streets, buildings and many artifacts. Excavation on the city began in 1967, and archaeologists were pleased to discover the ash had left artifacts, including paintings and murals, in excellent condition. Some speculate this could be the lost city of Atlantis. (Shutterstock) \nMemphis, Egypt: The ruins of Memphis are located 20 kilometres from Cairo, on the west bank of the Nile. After the city was abandoned, citizens of neighbouring towns took stone from Memphis to use in building their own homes and the city was reduced to rubble. (Shutterstock) \nTikal, Guatemala: This site was the centre of the Mayan world up to 900 A.D. Evidence even exists that Tikal conquered the Mexican centre Teotihuacan. The population at Tikal gradually declined, leading to abandonment and the burning of royal palaces. (Shutterstock) \nKuelap, Peru: This sixth century Chachapoyas fortress contains more than 400 buildings and served as a protective barrier from enemies. The fortress was hidden from the world for years until a judge exploring the area in 1843 discovered the site and drew international attention to the area. (Shutterstock) \nAlexandria, Egypt: In recent years, divers have discovered what is believed to be the royal quarters of Cleopatra, as well as many ancient artifacts, off the coast of Alexandria. Earthquakes are believed to be responsible for casting the building into the water. (Shutterstock) \nYonaguni Monument, Japan: Some archaeologists believe the structures located under the water off the coast of Yonaguni are man made, while others believe they are natural formations. Several details, such as pillars, a pool formation and straight walls, lead many to believe this is a lost city.
