Now that challenge comes with the potential of a one million dollar reward,” he said.\n“The promotion is timed to influence travel to the Top End during our low season from October to February with anglers encouraged to travel with their families and enjoy the unique tourism experiences and spectacular landscapes the whole of the Territory has to offer.\n“About 40,000 interstate visitors come to the Top End for fishing every year but we want to encourage even more people to stay, play and fish.\n“The new, exciting campaign is part of the Territory Government’s plan to drive the development of North Australia and build a $2.2 billion visitor economy by 2020.”\nTourism NT has partnered with CrownBet, Boating Camping Fishing (BCF), XXXX Gold, AOT and Qantas on what will be the biggest fishing competition in Australia.\nCrownBet CEO Matt Tripp said CrownBet was proud to be the major sponsor and underwriter of the Million Dollar Fish competition.\n“This is a world class competition and Australian first million dollar fishing giveaway. The 75 $10,000 instant win cash prize barramundi also give punters a fair chance at catching a decent prize,” he said.\nMate of the Territory and cricket legend Matthew Hayden, who will be the face of the Million Dollar Fish campaign, encouraged people to register for the competition.\n“As a Mate of the Territory, I’ve been lucky enough to enjoy a range of fishing experiences in the NT. From Bluewater fishing out of Darwin and the Tiwi Islands, to Billabong fishing at Kakadu, tropical sport fishing in East Arnhem Land and river fishing in Katherine – there’s something for everyone,” he said.\n“I think Million Dollar Fish will be a huge hit and I can’t wait to see if someone lands the big one.”\nAmateur Fishermen’s Association of the NT Executive Officer Tristan Sloan said his organisation worked with Tourism NT to ensure the competition complied with sustainable fishing and best practice tag and release fishing.\n“The Northern Territory is nationally and internationally renowned for its untouched environment, amazing wildlife and spectacular recreational fishing. AFANT is proud to support the Million Dollar Fish campaign as it demonstrates the importance of recreational fishing to tourism and the economy of the Top End for both local and visiting anglers,” he said.\nThe competition will run from 1 October 2015 to 29 February 2016, and participants must register online at www.milliondollarfish.com.au to compete.\nEveryone who registers for the competition before 31 August will have the chance to win a holiday to the Northern Territory for four people valued at $20,000.\nTourism NT will kick off a nationwide and international media blitz tonight to promote the new campaign and encourage people to register.\nRelated Posts Chelsea Football Club Hosts Leaders Sport Summit 2013, the world’s most Prestigious Sport Business Summit 29th Brolga Northern Territory Tourism Awards open for nomination MasterChef prepares lunch for celebrities attracting more visitation at Blists Hill Victorian Town UK-based tour operator offers weekend trip to other side of planet Giles Government to renovate Milingimbi Art and Culture Aboriginal Corporation", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T09:18:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
