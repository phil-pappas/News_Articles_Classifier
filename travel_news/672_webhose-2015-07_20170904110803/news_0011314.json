ATM withdrawals are limited to 60 euros per Greek citizen per day, though that amount may decrease in coming days. \nBut travelers shouldn't be concerned, according to Christos Stergiou, founder of Greek luxury travel company TrueGreece . \nFirst, foreigners are not subject to the same ATM restrictions. \"So far, tourists in Greece have been unaffected by recent economic developments,\" Stergiou told The Huffington Post. \"Foreign credit cards continue to be functional, even with the banks closed.\" \nAs a precaution, Stergiou says visitors to Greece should arrive with the full amount of Euros they'll need in cash, as ATMs may be out of money or have long lines . He also suggests that visitors use credit cards whenever possible during their stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T19:38:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
