From mid-November through early January, each resort—ranging from 1,400 to 2,882 guestrooms—becomes a holiday wonderland festooned with millions of lights, towering Christmas trees, enormous wreaths and glistening ornaments adorning indoor gardens beneath multi-acre atriums. \"On some of July's hottest days, we are focused on highly unseasonable tasks,\" said Mike Stengel , senior vice president of Gaylord Hotels. \"It's crunch time for us, and we're already hanging holiday lights in Nashville . With resorts this large, it takes many months to create the magical settings travelers and locals alike look forward to as part of their holiday traditions.\"Overnight packages and tickets are now available at www.ChristmasAtGaylordHotels.com for dazzling holiday entertainment and attractions in popular destinations like Nashville and just outside of Dallas , Orlando and Washington, D.C. \"Despite the simmering heat outside, we've ordered more than 8 million pounds of ice blocks to create ICE!—our popular frozen attraction that is kept at nine degrees Fahrenheit,\" Stengel said. \"Master ice artisans from Harbin, China are already preparing to carve the colorful ice sculptures and multi-story ice slides at each resort.\"At The Frostbite Factory inside ICE!, visitors will be able to see the craftsmanship of the ice carvers in action. Select locations will also include On the Blocks —an exclusive ice bar for guests ages 21 and older. ICE! is presented by Pepsi and themes for 2015 include Santa Claus is Comin' to Town at Gaylord National; Christmas Around The World at Gaylord Texan; The Nutcracker at Gaylord Opryland; and 'Twas the Night Before Christmas at Gaylord Palms. Visitors to the resorts will also enjoy The Elf on the Shelf® Scavenger Hunt, an interactive journey throughout the hotels. By finding all of the scout elves hiding in the resort and solving the puzzles in the scavenger hunt booklet, families will help Santa's scout elves fulfill their special Christmas mission. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T18:22:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
