This late summer offer will take sun-seekers on a mouth-watering tour of Croatia at its culinary best. The package is made up of a four-night stay at the five star resort, as well as a private boat excursion to the renowned Pelješac wine region and oyster tasting at Mali Ston. \nAs if that wasn't enough, a delicious degustation menu, perfectly paired with local wines carefully selected by the sommelier at Sun Gardens, Dubrovnik, will be waiting back at the resort. For Oenophiles and Foodies A private boat from Sun Gardens, Dubrovnik's resort marina, will take guests to Croatia’s famed Pelješac wine region to experience some of the country’s 60 native grape varieties. Pelješac’s vineyards are renowned for producing the Plavac Mali red grape, and guests will be able to meander through the rows of lush green vines, learning about the unique topography of the vineyard, as they go along. After the vineyard tour, guests will experience the wine for themselves with a tasting in one of Croatia’s leading wine cellars, followed by a lunch of fresh seafood at Mali Ston. For oyster lovers there is no better place to sample them. Shuck open fresh oysters - washed down with some delectable Croatian wine, of course. Back at Sun Gardens, Dubrovnik, an even greater treat awaits in the 'Tastes for all Senses' menu. Showcasing the very best regional produce, each delicious course is matched alongside a hand-picked local wine. Among the delights on the menu, are Mediterranean shrimps coupled with Istrian black truffle, as well as fresh fillet of John Dory which comes delightfully paired with a crisp Croatian white wine. For the culturally-minded Rich in medieval culture, Croatia boasts the second longest protective wall in Europe, the 'Walls of Ston.' Guests can step inside the ancient walls of this medieval city and explore the cobbled streets of a former major fort of the Ragusan Republic. Picturesque white-washed houses, replete with typically Croatian terracotta roofs, line the streets and help to make Ston an idyllic spot in which to while away an afternoon. The Resort Sun Gardens, Dubrovnik enjoys unrivalled views of the Adriatic and of the chocolate-box, characteristic Croatian architecture found at the nearby paradisiacal Elafiti Islands. For those particularly keen on catching those last summer rays, the resort has access to an idyllic beach that offers an array of water-based activities, as well as a wealth of international bars and restaurants and an exceptional fitness centre. And for those who don’t mind being indoors during the hottest part of the day, there is much pampering to be had within the resort’s award-winning Spa by OCCO. Leave this sweet-smelling sanctuary feeling refreshed and rejuvenated after a treatment using the locally inspired products. The Residences The Residences at Sun Gardens, Dubrovnik, continue to stand as one of the most prosperous and appealing real estate resort offerings in the whole of the South East Mediterranean.

There are now only 28 units available to purchase. The enviable lifestyle attached to owning property here is a reason for their allure, but there are strong financial benefits for investors, too. Homeowners are presented with hassle-free ownership, due to the fact that The Residences at Sun Gardens, Dubrovnik are managed and marketed for rental on behalf of proprietors, augmenting the appeal and guaranteeing smooth second home ownership. While the Dalmatian sun is an obvious pull, real estate buyers here have continuously benefited from the resort’s reliably high levels of occupancy throughout the season, meaning owners profitably gain from a competitive and increasing rental yield.
