The last measles death in the United States was in 2003.\nWhat a tragedy — and surely a preventable one.\nParents preparing to send their children back to school in the fall should know they have a role to play in protecting their children and preventing others from suffering.\nImmunizations save lives. States requiring vaccinations as a condition for school entry is one of the most effective ways to protect communities.\n California lawmakers just embraced this reality and mandated vaccines for most children. A similar bill went nowhere during Washington’s regular legislative session and three consecutive special sessions. Our elected officials should revisit the issue.\nThe California measure removes religious and personal belief exemptions. Vaccines are only waived if a child has a medical condition. So most parents can either vaccinate their children or home-school them.\nSuch a policy is needed here in Washington, which continues to have one of the highest exemption rates in the country, mostly for personal and religious reasons. The state Department of Health reports the number of kindergarten-age kids receiving required immunizations dropped two years in a row.\nLast year, the overall rate for measles-mumps-rubella, polio, hepatitis B, chickenpox, and whooping cough vaccination was 82.7 percent — a 0.5 percent drop from the previous year.\nWhen vaccine coverage falls below 95 percent, populations lose what is called “herd immunity” and are considered at higher risk of an outbreak.\nCalifornians learned this the hard way after more than 100 cases of measles in the United States and Mexico were traced back to one unvaccinated visitor to Disneyland.\nThe best way to prevent another outbreak or death is by respecting science.\nEven if Washington legislators haven’t yet mandated vaccines, parents should get their children immunized and protect the communities they live in.\nEditorial board members are editorial page editor Kate Riley, Frank A.
