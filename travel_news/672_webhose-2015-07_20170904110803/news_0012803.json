American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL), the dominant carrier at Charlotte Douglas International Airport, moved up in a ranking of major U.S. airlines' on-time performance in June, despite having fewer flights arrive on schedule than during the previous month. Fort Worth, Texas-based American finished June with 71.9% of its flights arriving on time, down from 75.2% in May, according to on-time-arrival data released Monday by FlightView, an airline and airport data provider. US Airways, acquired by American in 2013 but still flying under a separate banner, landed 72% of its flights on time last month, down from 80.2% in the previous month. Combined, the two carriers make up the world's biggest airline by operations, and the company's second-largest hub is at CLT. June was a rough month for air travel across the board, FlightView notes. Only 68.4% of flights overall arrived within 15 minutes of their scheduled times, down from 74.2% in May.
