The EMA will become the 23rd organisation to sit on the partnership and will add a clear voice of corporate business to the partnership’s current initiatives, particularly its campaign to increase the tax exemption around corporate parties. \n“We’re keen to make the voice of the in house corporate event organiser clearly heard and understood, and the BVEP is a great forum to do this,” comments Richard Waddington, Chair, Event Marketing Association. “We’re particularly interested in supporting initiatives that support our member’s desire to make events work for their businesses. The ‘Christmas Party Exemption’ is just one of a number of initiatives where we can support the BVEP, and share with our members. “ “The reach of our partnership is continuing to grow, and while we already have great representation with the ‘end buyer‘, EMA’s membership – being exclusively made up of in house organisers – gives us a clear voice from this sector,” comments Samme Allen, Vice Chair of the BVEP. The EMA has large ambitions and is looking to use the partnership as a platform to grow the association through ‘clusters’ across the UK. The EMA’s membership of the BVEP follows the announcements of its first industry partnerships and its support for the ICE Awards.
