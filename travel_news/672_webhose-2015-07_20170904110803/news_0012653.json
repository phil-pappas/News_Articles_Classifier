The Occidental chain, which runs 14 Latin American hotels, concentrated on the lobby in its $5 million renovation completed last December. The wide main floor contains a bit of everything — bright-white chandeliers, a grand piano, couches, plants and modern artwork and, at the center, the new walk-up Gastro & Wine Bar. The hotel also updated all of its 278 rooms.\nPhoto Location Of the top hotels in Santo Domingo, El Embajador is one of the farthest from tourist centers like the historic Zona Colonial (about four miles) and the oceanside Malecón strip (about 10 blocks). But the hotel will procure a cab for guests. And while the walk to Zona Colonial is long and hot, it passes ice cream shops and parks.\nThe Room My brother and I picked a Superior Room, the least expensive. Its furnishings included a wide desk and a modern office chair, as well as two soft double beds and soothing, dark-brown headboards and lamps. The best feature was the medium-size balcony, though it had just two white plastic chairs and a plastic table. Our view caught just a glimpse of the sea, but the hotel’s palm trees and other greenery made for a pleasant tropical ambience. An event at the hotel’s Garden Tent below our room meant booming music for two nights, but closing the windows and curtains mostly solved the problem, and we fell asleep easily.\nThe Bathroom Tight quarters, beige and nondescript, with a tiled shower and small sink counter.\nAmenities My favorite part of El Embajador was its restful outdoor garden, a groomed lawn centering on a beautiful century-old banyan tree. Food and drinks can be ordered from the outdoor Los Cotorras Bar. The pool is secluded among trees and plantings. The hotel also has a small fitness room with cardio machines and weights, lobby casino and free Wi-Fi.\nDining Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story Of El Embajador’s four dining options, Los Porches was the most inviting, a sunny place with several arched windows adjacent to the pool area and courtyard. The continental breakfast included in the rate was generous, with plenty of pancakes, eggs, juices and muffins, although none of it was especially distinctive, not even the fried plantains. The more expensive El Jardin del Embajador, also overlooking the courtyard, serves sandwiches, steak and seafood, all fresh. There’s also a tapas bar and a high-end restaurant for Royal Club members. The extensive room-service menu skews American, offering sandwiches and burgers with its enchiladas.\nBottom Line The affordable rooms are comfortable and functional, and while it’s a haul to get anywhere in Santo Domingo, there’s always a place to eat, drink and kick back when you return.", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/12/travel/12CHECKIN2/12CHECKIN2-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/12/travel/12CHECKIN2/12CHECKIN2-master180.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-09T19:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T20:04:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
