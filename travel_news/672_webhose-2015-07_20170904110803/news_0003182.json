I got off the flight to Costa Rica and got on a little four-seater Cessna plane and was dropped in the middle of the rainforest as the rain was pelting down. I got in a cab with no doors and asked the driver to take me to this hotel, and he told me in broken English it had burned down, so I wound up in a place costing five dollars a night.\n\"There was a cold shower and guys pounding on my door all night. I slept with my Swiss Army knife in my hand, thinking: 'I'm going home tomorrow!' Of course, things always seem worse in the night. Dawn broke and I thought I'd keep forging ahead... I was terrified and lonely. I've actually never talked about this before. You see incredible things and there was no-one to share them with. But I think it gave me a bit of chutzpah and ended up being one of the best things I've ever done. It taught me I could survive on very little too... It would do it that way all over again, it was life-changing.\"\nHave you ever felt unsafe when travelling?", "external_links": ["http://static.polldaddy.com/p/8982895.js", "http://polldaddy.com/poll/8982895/"], "published": "2015-07-16T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T03:02:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
