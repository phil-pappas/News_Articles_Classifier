His call came as commemorations were held in the Netherlands and Ukraine to mark the anniversary of the downing of MH17, killing 298 passengers and crew.\nWestern governments believe the rebels shot down the plane with a Russian-supplied BUK missile system, a version based on radio intercepts, photographic and video evidence, witness statements and satellite imagery. Russia denies involvement in the Ukrainian conflict.\nDutch authorities have said they are not yet ready to identify culprits, but have called for a UN tribunal.\nA report on the cause of the crash from the Dutch Safety Board, a preliminary copy of which has been circulated to half a dozen government with nationals onboard, is due in October.\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T20:02:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
