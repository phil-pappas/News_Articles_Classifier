Over the course of a week in the Austrian resort of Kuhtai last February, they tested the latest skis from leading brands such as Salomon, Head and Nordica to find the very best models. They reviewed men's and women's skis for all levels of skier (intermediate, advanced and expert) across seven categories of ski: piste, all mountain, freeride, big mountain freeride, big mountain freestyle, park & pipe and hike & ride. (See further below to find out more about each category of ski.) Each pair of skis was marked out of 10 for 11 criteria: Edge hold How well the edges hold in the turn, from the beginning to the end. Short turns How well the skis willingly switch from edge to edge and make quick turns down the fall line. Long turns How much the skis hold their course in long, sweeping turns. High speed How well the skis perform at high speeds. Are they stable? Do they turn well? Low speed How well the skis perform at slow speeds. Are they stable? Do they turn well? The testers mark each ski across 11 criteria (Photo: Adrian Myers) Smoothness How stable the skis feel while turning and over uneven snow. Liveliness/responsiveness How lively and responsive the skis are. How much rebound they give and how quickly they turn. Versatility How versatile the skis are. Are they at home on piste, off piste, in bumps, on flat slopes, on steeper slopes, in powder, on ice etc? Off piste How well they float in powder. How solid the platform feels in the crud and broken snow. Do they make skiing off piste easier? Groomed piste An overall score for their performance on groomed snow, encompassing turning and straight-line stability, liveliness/responsiveness, edge grip, and their overall balance between long and short turn performance. Moguls How good they feel when making short turns down the fall-line through a mogul field. Telegraph Ski equipment editor and Olympian Martin Bell amalgamated the results and determined the final winners for each category. The Best on Test skis were those that consistently scored the highest across the criteria, while the Best Value winners were those that combined solid performance with an affordable price tag. Full results will be published in this season’s issues of Telegraph Ski and Snowboard print and digital magazines, and online. The categories Which pair of skis you should rent or buy is entirely dependent on your ability level and the type of skiing you'll be doing the most. There's no point in buying a snazzy looking pair of park & pipe skis if you're going to spend the majority of your time cruising on piste. Take our quick quiz to find out which type of ski might be right for you, and read on to discover what each category is best for: Piste If you spend the majority of your time on the groomers – whether starting to carve or ripping GS arcs – these are the weapons for you. They’re designed with relatively narrow waists for good grip on hard snow and a quick response from edge to edge. Many of them, particularly at expert level, utilise technologies developed in the racing arena that help reduce excess vibrations to boost stability and improve edge hold while carving at high speed. Intermediate and advanced models are more forgiving at low speeds. All mountain The clue’s in the name. These skis have medium-width waists and are designed for 50/50 versatility all over the mountain – on piste and off piste, from hardpack piste through crud to deep pow. For improvers who like to venture off piste from time to time, all-mountain intermediate or advanced skis are a good shout, while more confident, aggressive skiers who want to spend more time off piste might be better off with wider, stiffer all-mountain expert models. Freeride Freeride skis are intended to be used all over the mountain in all snow conditions, but with a strong bias towards off piste since they have fairly wide waists. Freeride advanced models tend to be slightly narrower for a more forgiving ride, especially on piste, and are less well-suited to deep snow. Expert models, meanwhile, have wider waists, making them better suited to fast, aggressive powder skiing. Park & pipe While these are principally designed for freestyle – halfpipe, jumps, grinding rails and jibbing – some also perform well on piste. They tend to be twin-tipped, and relatively narrow so they’re light and manoeuvrable for airborne tricks. Top pipe performers carve well up the pipe, pop easily off the vert and stay stable on landing. Pop is important for big air, especially on take-off, along with swing weight in the air when spinning, and stability for landing. For rails and jibbing skis need to be durable to deal with hard knocks, as well as stable. Big mountain freeride Designed for extracting maximum enjoyment from bottomless powder, wide-bodied big mountain skis make the experience easy, offering ultimate flotation plus stability, even in crud. Most are geared towards pure freeriding. Although they’re highly specialised, some big mountain models are versatile enough for all-mountain use. Big mountain freestyle Similar to the freeride models, some big mountain skis are more freestyle orientated – twin-tipped with a centred binding-mounting point that favours riding switch and taking tricks off piste. Although they’re highly specialised, some big mountain models are versatile enough for all-mountain use. Hike & ride Hike & ride skis are designed to make ski touring – whereby you ascend the mountain on foot before skiing down – easier. To this end they are much lighter than traditional models. Olympian Martin Bell heads up the 17-strong test team (Photo: Adrian Myers) The winners Find out which 2015/16 models performed best in each category: • On-piste intermediate, advanced and expert winners • All-mountain intermediate, advanced and expert winners • Freeride advanced and expert winners • Big mountain freeride and freestyle winners • Park & pipe advanced and expert winners • Hike & ride winners The test team A total of 17 experienced skiers made up the Telegraph test team.
