But a new exhibition opening this weekend at the Bowes Museum in Barnard Castle will bring a little bit of fashion flair to the Durham Dales. Yves Saint Laurent: Style is Eternal is the first comprehensive collection of the French fashion designer’s work to go on display in the UK. It runs until October so there’s no excuse for missing out on the exhibition, or the tranquil charms of Teesdale.\nWhat to do\nEven if you’re not into fashion, the collection of paintings, sculptures, ceramics and silver on display at the château-like Bowes Museum is sure to impress ( thebowesmuseum.org.uk ). No less magnificent are the fine interiors and art collection at Raby Castle, with its walled gardens and deer park ( rabycastle.com ). The Bowlees visitor centre is the perfect starting point for walks in the north Pennines taking in local landmarks, such as Gibson’s Cave and High Force waterfall. Soothe aching muscles at the Garage, a cosseting day spa in a former petrol station ( thegaragespa.co.uk ). The attractive town of Barnard Castle has plenty of antique shops to browse and a monthly farmers’ market.\nWhere to stay\nThe Rose and Crown is an 18th-century coaching inn with cosy bedrooms and great food in the pretty village of Romaldkirk (B&B from £57.50 per person, rose-and-crown.co.uk ).\nWhere to eat\nIf you’ve been inspired by the Gallic flair on display at the Bowes Museum, follow it up with a visit to the Forresters Hotel in Middleton-in-Teesdale whose menu leans heavily on French classics ( forrestersmiddleton.co.uk ).\nInsider tip\n“Hit the vintage shops in Barnard Castle, then walk the three-mile round trip along the river Tees through the woods to the ruins of Egglestone Abbey,” says Rosie Bradford of the Bowes Museum. “Turner painted along this route, and it’s easy to see why – look at its fairy glens and old mills.”\nGive me a break Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Scandinavian style of Bert’s Barges in Hackney Home: floating palace in east London A “floating B&B” has just launched on the Regent’s Canal in Hackney. The one-bedroom barge has been cleverly converted into a luxury “hotel suite” with Scandinavian and vintage interiors, king-size bed, fitted kitchen, wood-burning stove, underfloor heating, large bathroom and a roof terrace. Rates are £300 a night, including a welcome hamper ( bertsbarges.com ).\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest If you didn’t catch Florence Welch at Glastonbury this year (pictured), seek out Sziget.
