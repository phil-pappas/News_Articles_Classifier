The highly anticipated Rubber Duck blew up at Sydney Festival. Source: News Limited \nTHE giant rubber duck has become a kind of benign icon as it floats peacefully around the world’s most famous landmarks. \nBut not everyone thinks the yellow inflatable is so innocent. \nIn fact, the popular bird annoys some onlookers so much they literally attacked it with knives, during a night-time assault in Belgium. \nThe 2009 knife attack, in which the Rubber Duck was stabbed 42 times, triggered the launch of the Giant Duck Night Watch for the remainder of its stay in the country. But it isn’t just the Belgians who are trying to take this bird down. \nDespite the ducky’s cutesey appearance, the artwork designed by Dutchman Florentijn Hofman has proved more controversial than Tracey Emin’s bed. \nThe 12-metre waterfowl first bobbed into view at a 2007 arts festival in France and has since popped up in Australia, New Zealand, the US, Brazil, China and everywhere in between. It has attracted unprecedented crowds, endless Instagram posts and media coverage across the globe. \nOne journalist in Azerbaijan even called the 12-metre creature a “worldwide celebrity”. \nAltas Obscura now observes that “the duck’s biggest sin may be its own ubiquity.” Police tow the giant duck through troubled waters down Brisbane River.

Source: istock \nThe rubber duck is a universal symbol, and this oversized representation has crossed borders with the same ease as a brand like Coca-Cola. \nIn an article entitled The Rubber Duck must be stopped , a journalist at City Lab added it also shared “all the nutritional value and regional identity of a Diet Coke”. As the most recognisable public conceptual artwork of our time, he added, “it sends an infantilising message about the role of public art in cities.” That giant duck cost $20,000?! If they paid that much, this duck better be able to fill pot holes or play on the Steelers offensive line. — Pittsburgh Dad (@Pittsburgh_Dad) September 27, 2013 \nThere was outrage in Pittsburgh when it was rumoured that the city paid $US20,000 to bring “the circus to town”. \nAnd Hofman made no friends by reportedly complaining over the sale of unlicensed merchandise in Taiwan — yes, that’s rubber duck-themed items — The Taipei Times reported. He then refused to attend the duck’s launch in Keelung harbour , criticising organisers for turning it into a “commercial circus.” Dutch artist Florentijin Hofman objected to the ‘commercial circus’ around his work in Taiwan.

In Philadelphia, Hofman complained about an “ unauthorised rubber duck project ” at June’s Tall Ships festival, adding that “the rubber duck is not a joke”. \nA man selling duck T-shirts in Pittsburgh received an email from the city’s cultural trust telling him his shirts were “a major problem”, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette revealed. \n“It feels like advertising, the way that people like to look out for the Goodyear Blimp,” Moby Dick author Donovan Hohn told Atlas Obscura . “For me it becomes less interesting the more he does it.” I made a really big sandwich. Now I own copyright over ALL THE SANDWICHES. #FlorentijnHofman — James Griffiths (@jgriffiths) June 25, 2013 \nThings got even more heated in China, where authorities banned searches for “giant yellow duck” in 2013 after an artist replaced tanks with the placid bird in an infamous photo of Tiananmen Square. \nSo is the brightly coloured artwork a modern masterpiece, beautiful for its simplicity, or is it a depressing non-statement that makes bland pointlessness its only goal? \nWhatever you think, this duck looks set to keep on swimming around the big pond.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T02:03:05.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
