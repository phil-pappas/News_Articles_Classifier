Source: Supplied\nThe most noticeable change to the aircraft design is that there are now modifications to the wings and tail.\n“The new delta wing of the S-512 delivers high aerodynamic efficiency and improved flight performance in both low-speed flight and supersonic cruise,” Spike wrote.\n“The highly swept leading-edge reduces wave drag and consequently reduces fuel burn and increases range.\n“Improved stability characteristics of the new S-512 design allowed us to eliminate the horizontal tail resulting in further reduction of drag and weight.”\nWhile the plane is not yet commercially available, those looking to purchase the S-512 should start saving with the final price expected to cost between $60 million and $80 million.\nOriginally published as ‘From New York to London in three hours’", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/spike-aerospaces-s-512-supersonic-jet-promises-to-fly-from-new-york-to-london-in-three-hours/story-fnjwucti-1227434177171", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/08/1227434/176402-3320ac5a-2530-11e5-b9c8-881f1ce24d70.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/08/1227434/177980-0968533a-2531-11e5-b9c8-881f1ce24d70.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-09T14:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T17:57:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
