Thome, eTN Africa Correspondent | Jul 22, 2015 Adv: \nInformation from Kigali suggests that the Rwanda Revenue Authority padlocked the Kigali Golf Club over alleged tax arrears, leaving Rwanda’s golfers with no ground to play their favourite sport on in the capital city. \nIt is understood that the club maintains it is a not for profit organization where, if any profits are indeed made, the funds are ploughed back into developing the course further, but apparently did the taxman have none of that when they shut the club down. \nThe Nyarutarama based club is regular host to corporate sponsored tournaments for which golfers from the entire region are flying into Kigali and upcoming events are now in doubt, among them the East Africa Golf Challenge in August and the club’s showcase event, the Rwanda Open in early September. \nOn the upside can those who are addicts of the game fly with RwandAir from Kigali to Mombasa and play championship golf at the Vipingo Ridge Golf Club, or else use some of the other highly rated courses like the Nyali Golf & Country Club or Leisure Lodge’s 18 hole championship course in Diani to combine a mini vacation with some serious training ahead of future tournaments, when the Kigali Golf Club is re-opened. \nOne source spoke of the matter being referred to government for a decision, in view of the social value of the sport and to resolve any pending documentation issues over the not for profit nature of the club. \nYet, another source suggested that the taxation could have arisen from the sale of food and drinks at the club house, or PAYE taxes from employees, making it important that all aspects are looked into and a solution found, unless Rwanda’s capital Kigali would be left without a course to play on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T08:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T10:00:36.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
