Labor MPs Anthony Albanese, Penny Wong, Bill Shorten, Tanya Plibersek and Louise Pratt celebrate passing the marriage equality amendment at Labor national conference. Picture: Hamish Blair Source: News Corp Australia\n“We lay down the challenge to Mr Abbott and his liberals, please give your members of Parliament a free vote so we can make equality a reality now,’’ he said.\nIf same-sex marriage was not legalised in Australia before the next election, Mr Shorten said he would introduce a marriage equality bill into parliament within 100 days of becoming Prime Minister.\nA tearful Senator Wong thanked delegates to the Labor Conference for agreeing to abolish the party’s support for a conscience vote after the next term of federal parliament.\nSenator Wong, who is gay, said the party should never have had a conscience vote on marriage equality and recalled being forced by the party to vote in 2004 “for my own discrimination.’’\nShe said she hoped marriage equality was approved by Parliament before the next election.\n“I want to win it sooner — I want to win it in this parliament,’’ Senator Wong said.\nMr Shorten said the long phase-out of the conscience vote would help demonstrate to people who opposed same-sex marriage that they were still welcome in the Labor Party.\n“I understand there are sincerely-held views contrary to the proposition of marriage equality,’’ he said.\n“The Labor Party is still a party that says to people of religious faith you are welcome in our party’’.\nSouth Australian Labor Senator Alex Gallacher, who opposes same-sex marriage, reacted calmly to the decision to phase out the conscience vote.\n“The can has been kicked well and truly down the road,’’ he said.\nThe conference vote occurred after Labor’s Left faction decided to push for the abolition of the conscience vote on marriage equality.\nSenior members of Labor’s Left, including Anthony Albanese and Kim Carr, spoke out against their faction’s hard line.\nThe Australian Christian Lobby condemned the Labor Conference’s decision on marriage equality.\nThe three-day conference in Melbourne ended Sunday night.\nThe conference voted to scrap the requirement for party members to also hold union membership.\nThe party also endorsed a proposal for 50 per cent of election candidate to be women.\nProposals for rank-and-file Labor members to get more say on the preselection of Senate candidates were voted down.", "external_links": ["http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/26/1227457/820466-c79bc576-3387-11e5-8361-c04dc8d2464e.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-27T04:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T15:19:56.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
