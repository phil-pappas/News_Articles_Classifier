Specifically, Kondakarla Ava lake is interesting place to visit or I should think any other place to visit? Is it possible to plan full day return excursion to Jagdalpur from Araku and return to Araku in the same day after visiting important places there? How is condition of Jagdalpur now? Is it safe from Maoist activities? I have excluded Nagarjuna Dam from the itinerary. Is it at all worth to visit? Am I missing any important visiting place from Vizag or Hyderabad?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T15:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T17:25:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
