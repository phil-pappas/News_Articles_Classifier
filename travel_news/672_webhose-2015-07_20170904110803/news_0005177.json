The first version of \"Streets of Old Milwaukee\" opened in January 1965, inspired by a 19th century drugstore and barbershop exhibit in the museum’s library building. The exhibit changed over the years, including the addition of the Watson Family House, highlighting objects from the home of freed Virginia slave Sully Watson. “The 'Streets of Old Milwaukee' is probably the most popular exhibit in Wisconsin and is certainly so for residents of Milwaukee,” said Dennis Kois , president and CEO of the Milwaukee Public Museum. “The renovation gives us an incredible opportunity to both enrich the experience already there by taking visitors deeper into the magical experience of going back in time, but also to weave into that experience the viewpoints of people who were living in the city at that time, but whose voices were left out.” When the new exhibit opens, visitors will enter through a life-size streetcar that will seem to travel back in time. New soundscapes, sights and smells and interactive technology will update the display to show the changes in Milwaukee following the industrial revolution. \nWant Milwaukee Travel news in your inbox?
