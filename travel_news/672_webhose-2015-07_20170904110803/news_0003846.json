They enjoyed the unique experience of sailing on a larger, luxurious, colonial-style Pandaw ship in Halong Bay, exploring Hanoi from the perspective of the river and admiring unspoilt scenery on the Da and Red Rivers. We also had excellent praise for the cuisine and excursion programme, some to places visited by tourists for the first time’.\nSource:-Halong Bay\nRelated Posts Amawaterways Introduces More Opportunities dor Solo Travelers TripAdvisor touches mark of 100 million downloads for free app for iPhone and Android Quantum of the Seas sets sail from her new homeport of Shanghai Fred.
