There were no reports of injuries.\nLasers can distract or temporarily blind pilots. Pointing one at a plane is a federal crime.\nThe FAA says at least three of the incidents involved flights near Newark Liberty International Airport.\nThree flights were at 3,000 feet and were 4 miles south of the Outerbridge Crossing, which connects Perth Amboy to Staten Island, New York. One flight was headed to LaGuardia Airport.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T12:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T18:47:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
