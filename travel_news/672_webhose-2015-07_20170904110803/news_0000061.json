But, in a maturing service-provider market, how can you tell whose Cloud is right for you? THE GOOD Cloud promises flexibility, agility and ease of use – attributes equally applicable to good service providers – but ask them for proof. “Good” providers are mature, capable and efficient, with a clear strategy and the stability to execute effectively. What makes a managed service is people, rather than hiding behind portals and live chat Good providers: • Ask about your application workloads instead of telling you about their platforms. • Don’t blink when your strategy changes mid-contract and you need to reshape your service. • Offer clear, first-hand detailed evidence of customer value delivery. • Have a strong technology investment road map that directly benefits customers. Ask them what they will be doing in 12, 24 and 36 months. • Know that what makes a managed service is people, rather than hiding behind portals and live chat. THE BAD “Bad” in providerland is about immaturity, either at a service or business level: weak contracts, data governance issues, insufficient security – the typical risks of choosing fragile start-ups or traditional businesses with stretched models. You have to believe in your provider so make sure there’s substance and direction under the bonnet Bad providers: • Typically sell on technology which can quickly become irrelevant. They need to be able to talk to you (and deliver) in business terms. • Love bespoke solutions (lock in; bigger price tag), when you could achieve the same outcome using a more standardised, lower-cost and future-portable approach. Push them hard on this. • Do not overinvest in engineers, platforms or innovation – an absolute requirement for future relevance and business stability. • Lack vision and a history of delivering against it. You have to believe in your provider so make sure there’s substance and direction under the bonnet. • Use their size to indicate capability. The provider market is acquisitive – turnover may entice but the business may not be committed to long-term investment and customer retention. THE UGLY Sometimes things just turn ugly – think 2e2 and Colt’s Managed Services. And, unless hybrid Cloud is the absolute core of your provider’s medium-term strategy and the dominant revenue stream, the chances are they will fail. Look for technology commonality. Transformation should be undertaken at your pace on your terms So what do you do when your provider no longer wants your business? • Don’t panic. If you have to move, you need to take control. If you can’t resource the change immediately, find an experienced partner to help. • Take stock. What do you have today and what do you need? Do you have to recreate like-for-like? • Nail the basics first. It takes 90-plus days to provision new network connections. Choose a provider in the same data centre/with the same carrier to reduce timescales. • Look for technology commonality. Transformation should be undertaken at your pace on your terms. Common technologies lower your migration risk. • Focus. You have three immediate priorities: safe hands, soft landing, great people. Any questions?
