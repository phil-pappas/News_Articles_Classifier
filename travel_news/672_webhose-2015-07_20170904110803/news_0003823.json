(AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating after 11 commercial flights reported they were illuminated by lasers while flying over New Jersey. The FAA says the incidents occurred Wednesday between 9 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. The agency says the lasers hit the left and right sides of the cockpits, along with the sides of the planes. There were no reports of injuries. Lasers can distract or temporarily blind pilots. Pointing one at a plane is a federal crime. The FAA says at least three of the incidents involved flights near Newark Liberty International Airport. Three flights were at 3,000 feet and were 4 miles south of the Outerbridge Crossing, which connects Perth Amboy to Staten Island, New York. One flight was headed to LaGuardia Airport.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T18:17:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
