Two Formula One teams went out of business last season, bringing to 153 the number to have folded since the championship started in 1950. Nor are all the 20 races on the F1 calendar highly lucrative. Indeed, the Hungarian Grand Prix, which takes place at the Hungaroring near Budapest on Sunday, would probably not be profitable without large subsidies from the Hungarian government. Despite this, the value of the core Formula One franchise continues to grow, with F1 valued at nearly £5bn in stake sales three years ago and projected to post operating income of £290m this year. Corporate sponsors find its global reach appealing. In the 11 years since Red Bull began its involvement in Formula One, its worldwide revenues have more than doubled from £1.58bn to £3.56bn. Infiniti, the Nissan car marque that sponsors the successful Red Bull Formula One team, has also grown on the back of the exposure that the deal offers. Its global car sales have climbed by 27.5pc to 186,000 since 2011, the year that the sponsorship started. In the first half of this year, Infiniti sold a record 103,500 new vehicles around the world, a 13pc rise over the same period last year. Energy and enthusiasm may be the key to F1 producing better returns on investment Meanwhile, F1 has signed deals in recent years with the Emirates airline, the watch manufacturer Rolex and communications firm Tata. In total, more than 300 brands sponsor F1, spending almost £1bn annually. Governments also invest more than £400m in races each year, mainly because of the tourism revenues that they can attract on the back of the grands prix. So what is the case for investing in motor sports? What do they have to offer business and how can companies leverage their unique worldwide pulling power to reap business benefits? Giles Morgan, global head of sponsorship for HSBC, which spent $18m (about £11.5m) to sponsor Shanghai’s first Grand Prix in 2014, says: “The financial services sector is probably the biggest investor in the sports sponsorship sector globally because all of us are trying to reach out to everyday people with their passions. “The key to it is then about segmenting and understanding what are the passions of the people that you’re trying to target. It’s an important part of the HSBC world. We use sponsorship pretty aggressively to help fulfil business needs that include marketing but go a lot further.” Matthew Carter, chief executive of Lotus F1, believes that criticism of Formula One’s track record of investment has been overdone. “It’s very easy for everyone to talk about financial problems and ‘small team syndrome,’” he says, “but our draft accounts show that we went from losing £64m in 2013 to losing £3m in 2014.’’ “You look up and down the pit lane and there are 10 teams desperately trying their best. We have 500 people at our factory and we’re a reasonably small team. There’s great passion.” That energy and enthusiasm may be the key to F1 producing better returns on investment, if it can be captured by corporate sponsors and utilised to engage with F1’s fan base. Social media offers the best route of achieving this goal. Rob Bloom, group head of digital at McLaren Marketing, says that the company’s social media communities are showing enormous growth and offer huge potential in unlocking fans’ passion. If F1 can develop a credible and unifying social media strategy, those investment cynics might yet be won over. And the true benefits of investing in the sport could start to emerge. Triumph of technology with mass appeal “Formula One is an industry worthy of study in itself. F1 is the most watched annual sporting series in the world, with more than 525 million people watching over the the season. It has an estimated turnover of more than $4bn; employs around 50,000 people in more than 30 countries; and embodies the cutting edge of technology. Technologies developed for F1 racing are relevant to many other industries. Innovations by leading teams such as Ferrari, McLaren, Red Bull, Williams among others have made their way not only into the regular road car industry, but also bicycling, tracking people in factory shop-floors, hospitals, sports training, advanced engineering and even public transport systems.” – Paolo Aversa Strategy fellow, Cass Business School Read more: • Potential is delivered by a collective approach • Cutting-edge technology moves sport into the digital age • Investment predictions within the sports industry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T23:11:33.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
