The resort is also popular year-round due to the [wildebeest] migration in the summer.” \nSomak had been selling Zanzibar in Tanzania as an alternative beach destination. \n“The FCO warning was just for the coast north of Mombasa - the south coast was still open but the advice put people off,” added Masani. “Now Mombasa is open for business and we think demand will pick up.” \nKenya should also benefit from US president Barack Obama’s visit for the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Nairobi on July 24-26. \nSomak’s prices lead at £690pp for seven nights in Mombasa with half-board accommodation at Travellers Beach hotel, flights and transfers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T15:45:45.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
