Source: News Corp Australia \nQANTAS has dropped flights between Melbourne and Perth and downgraded some of its Sydney flights. \nFrom October 25, the airline will cancel one Airbus A330 Melbourne to Perth service from eight to seven a day. \nA service from Perth to Melbourne will also be dropped. \nAnd the airline has swapped six of its seven flights a week between Sydney and Perth from the Airbus A330 to the smaller Boeing 737 between Sydney and Perth. \n“These small changes to our east-west flying allow us to add wide body domestic services between Sydney and Brisbane and form part of our twice yearly schedule update,” a Qantas spokesman told PerthNow . \n“We are able to move our aircraft around to match market conditions and demand.” \nAustralian Hotels Association WA chief executive Bradley Woods said it was “devastating news” for the state’s economy and the tourism sector. \n“It’s disappointing that Qantas is reducing services to Perth so as to increase and benefit the Queensland and New South Wales routes,” he said. \n“Qantas continues to treat WA with contempt by not consulting with the hotel and hospitality industry before it makes such dramatic changes. \n“These changes directly impact on future visitation, hotel room nights, car hire, tours of regional WA, retail and food and beverage spend. \n“Decisions like these have the potential to damage WA’s economic tourism 2020 targets. \n“Qantas has not learnt from its previous mistakes of poor industry stakeholder engagement when it withdrew Perth international services with no consultation.” \nQantas reinstated its Perth-to-Singapore route in June 2015 after a year’s hiatus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T11:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T13:15:21.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
