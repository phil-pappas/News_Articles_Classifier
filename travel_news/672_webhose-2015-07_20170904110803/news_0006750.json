Doug Hartmayer, Niagara Frontier Transportation Authroity spokesman, said the private club and lounge will be closed later this year as part of the merger between the two airlines which will phase out the USAirways brand. The NFTA was notified of the impending closure on July 23. Located along the airport’s west concourse, the USAirways Club was open to VIPs and preferred customers of the airline. American Airlines is closing several of USAirways Clubs around the country. “It was a decision made by the airline,” Hartmayer said. “It was a very active club.” USAirways has, historically, been one of the busier airlines at the Buffalo airport. Until the 2000 arrival of Southwest Airlines, it was the busiest air carrier serving Buffalo Niagara International Airport. In June, the airline handled just 13 percent of the airport’s traffic. In hard numbers that amounted to 26,376 outbound passengers, a figure that was up 2.53 percent from last June. Hartmayer said the NFTA will market the club space to other airlines and, potentially, other private operators. \nWant Buffalo Media & Marketing news in your inbox?
