They want to make a quick profit,” said Jose Vazquez, a professor at the School of Architecture and Interior Design at Miami Dade College. \n“One of the things that would make these different developments unique was architecture,” he told AFP. \nThe exotic lure that the Middle East stirred in the United States inspired Glenn Curtiss, the millionaire entrepreneur who was the driving force behind Opa-locka. \n“So Orient, or the idea of the Orient, 1920. We are talking about the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun, also we had big movie blockbusters like ‘The Thief of Baghdad,’” Vazquez added. \nWhile the town was under construction, however, the real estate bubble burst. A hurricane in 1926 also proved catastrophic for the project. Then Curtiss died in 1930, taking with him any hope of completing it. \nOf 100 Islamic-style buildings that were projected, only 70 were built. These days only 50 or so remain, in varying degrees of conservation or decay, said Vazquez. \nTwenty buildings here feature on the national registry of historic buildings, including town hall, which boasts towering minarets, six domes and ample gardens. It was the centrepiece of Curtiss’s grand plan. Now it is being restored. \nBars and churches \nIndeed, the oasis that Curtiss foresaw dried up, and Opa-locka slid into decline. The nadir came toward the end of the 20th century as crime spread and the city earned a reputation for violence. The image has stuck, even today. \nForty per cent of its 16,000 residents — 65 per cent of them black and 30 per cent Latino — live under the poverty line. \n“Here, all there is are bars and churches. Bars and churches,” said Fernando Campos, age 65. \nThe Opa-locka Community Development Corporation has spearheaded efforts to give the town a facelift, especially with art projects but also through housing construction and restoration of public parks and other green areas — all with public and private subsidies. \nThe goal is to turn Opa-locka into a tourist draw that will appeal to some of the millions of people who visit nearby Miami every year, said Willie Logan, president of the community development group. \n“The city is very unique, in the sense that it has its own airport, its own train station, its Moorish architecture. It is a world-class city that has the potential to be a great city,” said Logan. \nColour in the streets \nThe community development group has invested US$2.5 million in art projects and the results are becoming apparent: murals, spruced-up urban areas and a community centre with a growing calendar of cultural events. \nIslamic style is the underlying theme that holds all the projects together. \nDozens of volunteers recently refurbished and decorated several blocks along Ali Baba Avenue, applying fresh coats of paint and motifs based on the lines and geometrical patterns typical of Middle Eastern architecture. \nSome artists, rather than settle in hip areas of Miami, are opting for Opa-locka. \n“When I first moved here no one believed that we were here to try to actually make changes,” said Germane Barnes, an architect and designer who hails from Los Angeles. \n“No one believed me when I said that I was actually going to move into the neighbourhood.” \nPeople are noticing colour coming back to the streets. \n“It is unique. You still go there and you are transported literally to a place that you never suspected you would ever see here,” said Vazquez. \n“For me that is what makes Opa-locka so unique and so worth preserving.” — AFP Relaxnews pic More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T13:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T13:31:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
