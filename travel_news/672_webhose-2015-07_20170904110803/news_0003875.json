In its own constitution, Montenegro is described as a \"democratic, prosperous and environmental country.\" Its name consists of two words \"monte\" and \"negro,\" meaning mountain and black, respectively. Thanks to its historical cities and natural beauty, Montenegro attracts many tourists from around the world, including famous Hollywood stars. As no visa is demanded from Turkish citizens, Montenegro is an attractive choice for people planning a vacation during Ramadan. Combined with this visa regulation, Montenegro's beautiful sea, green nature, medieval-inspired architecture, safety and similarity to Turkish culture make it one of the most popular destinations for Turkish tourists. The main attraction of Montenegro is Budva, one of the oldest human settlements, which has a history of 2,500 years, along with its Sveti Stefan Island, a small and calm island, mainly famous for hosting Hollywood stars. Kotor, Montenegro's capital Podgorica and the old capital of the monarchy, Cetinje, with architecture inspired by the Middle Ages, are among other popular destinations in Montenegro. Also, Europe's jewel, the Tara River runs through Montenegro for 82 kilometers, carving up the Tara Canyon, the world's second largest canyon after the Grand Canyon in Colorado, offers visitors many activities, such as jeep safaris and rafting sports. Durmitor National Park, located north of Montenegro, Skador Lake and National Park, Ostrog Monastery, Vlaska Church and many other churches and ethnographic and national museums are also attractions popular with tourists. Moreover, Montenegro stands out from its neighbors as a clean, unpolluted country with drinkable water, natural reserves and pristine nature due to the absence of industrial activities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T20:59:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
