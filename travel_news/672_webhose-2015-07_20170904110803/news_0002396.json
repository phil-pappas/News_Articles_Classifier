These skis have medium-width waists and are designed for 50/50 versatility all over the mountain – on piste and off piste, from hardpack piste through crud to deep pow. For improvers who like to venture off piste from time to time, all-mountain intermediate or advanced skis are a good shout, while more confident, aggressive skiers who want to spend more time off piste might be better off with wider, stiffer all-mountain expert models. All-mountain intermediate Best on test Best value Head Primal Instinct £299 (including bindings) Best for: Easy turning on piste, in crud or in powder The Primal Instincts top the group for short turns, long turns, low speed, smoothness, versatility, groomed piste and moguls. These are good for intermediates wanting skis that turn easily on piste, in crud and in powder. Their stable platform and ease of turning make them real confidence boosters. Liveliness is the only area in which they don't do so well in comparison to their other excellent marks. Tech talk Sidewall construction, with a synthetic core strengthened with titanal and Graphene (a new, lightweight form of carbon). Rockered on the front 20 per cent. + Short turns, long turns, low speed, smoothness, versatility, groomed piste, moguls – Liveliness/responsiveness Lengths: 142, 149, 156, 163, 170, 177 Sidecut: 123/70/106 (170) Radius: 12.8m (170) Best on test Rossignol Experience 80 £415 (including bindings) Best for: Agility in moguls or choppy snow The Experience 80s are deemed best of this category for short turns, long turns, high speed and groomed piste. Great all-round skis for intermediates who want to travel all over the mountain, they provide a great stability in all terrain. They're nippy, agile through the moguls and easy to get on their edges, while being more than capable of handling choppy off piste. Best for adventurous skiers looking to try new terrain. Tech talk Cap construction, with sidewalls underfoot and a wood core reinforced with fibreglass. The tips are filled with air to reduce weight while retaining torsional rigidity. Rockered at tips and tails. + Short turns, long turns, high speed, groomed piste – None Lengths: 144, 152, 160, 168, 176, 184 Sidecut: 125/80/114 (all lengths) Radius: 17m (176) Women's all-mountain intermediate Best on test Best value Volkl Aurena £350 (including bindings) Best for: On-piste carving and cutting through heavy off piste The Aurenas dominate the all mountain intermediate category in nine out of the 11 performance criteria, achieving particularly high scores for edge hold, long turns, smoothness, liveliness/responsiveness and groomed piste. Great for carving on piste, they're solid through the turn, and once they're on edge they're really stable. Off piste, they hold their own, and are solid enough to cut through heavier snow. They're ideal for those looking to explore more off piste and ski fast and aggressively on piste. Tech talk: Cap construction, with a wood core and tip rocker. + Edge hold, short turns, long turns, high speed, smoothness, liveliness/responsiveness, versatility, groomed piste, moguls – None Lengths: 141, 147, 153, 159, 166 Sidecut: 120/75/105 (all lengths) Radius: 13.7m (159) Best on test Rossignol Temptation 77 £375 (including bindings) Best for: Manoeuvrability at all speeds The Temptation 77s lead the group for low speed, versatility, off piste and moguls.

More suited to off piste than some others in this category, these are great all rounders. Powerful off piste, they prefer big turns, but can still pivot easily at lower speeds and when on piste. These skis swing gracefully left to right with brilliant rebound – making them hugely enjoyable in the powder. They don't score quite as well for low speed as for high.
