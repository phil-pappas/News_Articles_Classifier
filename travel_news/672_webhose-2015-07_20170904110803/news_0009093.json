Crystal’s newly expanded fleet will truly be travelers’ passport to virtually the entire world.” \nTan Sri Lim said once the operator takes delivery of its exclusive class ships it will be able to offer luxury expedition-capable ships. \nRodriguez added: “With an impressive 100 tons of space per guest, the average space ratio for luxury cruise ships being 60 tons per person, our new ships’ guest-to-space rations will be vast in comparison to past, current and under- construction luxury ships, reaching all corners of the world safely, smoothly and in the utmost style and comfort.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T11:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T05:37:38.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
