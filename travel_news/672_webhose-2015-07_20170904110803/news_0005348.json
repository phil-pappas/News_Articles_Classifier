But we are monitoring it very closely.\"\nMr Mathobela had recommended that the contract be reviewed and a fixed rate of R11 be agreed upon as Swifambo was \"unlikely\" to agree to R10.62 — because it was based on 2011 figures, but could still make a profit.\nSwifambo’s \"all-in price\" of R10.40, which was \"translated as the maximum currency loss\" the consortium was willing to take, meant it had probably hedged its position, Mr Mathobela said.\n\"With the current situation we (Prasa) find ourselves in, they (Swifambo) have priced in a way that they will be getting more rands to buy fewer euros for their payments in Europe,\" Mr Mathobela said in the memo.\nPrasa has also entered into a R51bn deal with Gibela Rail Consortium for 3,600 Alstom-built coaches.\nMr Montana said the hedging on this contract was dealt with by the Treasury because of its size.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T09:33:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
