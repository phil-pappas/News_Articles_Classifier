Only if you’re saying the lady is wet, windy, unreliable and a bit bipolar, Mr Shakespeare. As the season formerly known as the English summer continues to blight the nation’s barbecues and dampen its spirits, scientists are doing their level best to bring mathematical rigour to the fraught question of the ideal holiday. For example, recent research from the Highways Agency found that it is precisely two hours and 23 minutes into a holiday journey before parents hear the dread question: “Are we nearly there yet?” It is 14 minutes after that when the arguments break out. Far be it from me to cast aspersions on the methodology of researchers, but what experimental children did they take with them on their experimental vacation? Not mine, that’s for sure. When the diabolical duo were little, “Are we nearly there?” was often uttered before the car was out of the driveway. Hostilities usually commenced within quarter of an hour, or once the snacks had run out. (That was in the days before you could hook the little darlings up to an intravenous Pixar drip. Thank God for Stephen Fry and Harry Potter audiobooks.) Summer? This is a wind up... For the duration of one never-to-be-forgotten Eurostar trip, our toddler pawed the train window and sobbed, “Are we still in England? Are we still in England?”, like an inconsolable, Pampers-wearing Enoch Powell. As for the scientific formula for the Perfect Holiday, the psychologist Dr David Holmes of Manchester Metropolitan University has come up with one based around “anticipation” and “expected memories”. If you’re like me, you probably think you want to “fly and flop”. Dr Holmes, however, says that a break packed full of “rich experiences” offers maximum benefit. He suggests that people should aim to book their trip at least 120 days in advance, and plan at least one unique activity per day . Got that? Me neither. So far I’ve booked one Turkish boat trip, washed and ironed three kaftans and have an acute case of Pre-Packing Paralysis Syndrome. Never fear. Dr Holmes has also come up with a formula for the “perfect family day out” based on a study of 1,000 parents and 500 kids for Butlins. The study found that “five times as many families do what their children want rather than something for the whole family to enjoy together”. Correct. “One in 14 families ends up doing something no one wants to do”. Definitely. And my family ends up with mummy bursting into tears and refusing to go anywhere because everyone is so late/moody/teenage/hideous/ungrateful. Just to add to the carefree holiday vibe, the majority of parents in the study said they wanted to spend five to six hours a day with their children while the majority of children said they wanted to spend – oh – “one to two hours” with their parents. Well, I never. Anyone for squabbles? Perhaps the least surprising finding is that 26 per cent of mothers admit they find it “difficult to relax”. That’s because they’re running the “holiday” which is basically normal life relocated to a place with multiple sunburn opportunities and no dishwasher tablets. Meanwhile, dads “slip into relaxation straightaway”. That’s because sun-cream application isn’t in their job description and they aren’t organising the holiday. In fact, it’s perfectly possible that many men may have no firm idea where the holiday is taking place, even after it’s over. “It’s clear that families want to spend time together,” insists Dr Holmes, “but the array of personalities and interests in any family dynamic means that there is unlimited potential for people to disagree”. Dr Holmes’s solution is this easy-to-use formula: (FT+TP) x (TA+NA)-W2/(TE). OK, chaps, I want you to memorise that. FT stands for “family time/interaction”, TP is types of places to visit, NA is the “number of activities you do together”, W is the Weather (rain, gales, typhoon, plague of locusts etc). E is “emotional expression (number of times you laugh or hug as a family)” and T is the amount of technology you use (a negative factor). So that’s as clear as the villa pool after Mehmet has poured some raki in to clean it. Having already failed miserably to follow Dr Holmes’s excellent formula, let me offer my own suggestions, based on almost 20 years of bitter experience. Here are Pearson’s top tips for an imperfectly good family holiday (where no one kills anyone): Do try to avoid starting every conversation with the kids, “If you think I’m going to let you stare at a screen for two weeks…”. You will run out of threats/bribes very quickly. Don’t take small children anywhere they don’t sell Calpol and you can’t drink the tap water. Do ban technology during the hours of daylight (Kindle is exempt). Don’t let the kids catch you on Twitter after lunch. Do plan a chic, stress-free “capsule wardrobe” as recommended in Harper’s Bazaar. Don’t stress when the “capsule” turns out to be the Apollo 11 space capsule. There’s nothing that induces Packing Paralysis faster than the fear of leaving Things You Never Know You Might Need (ballgown, ice skates) behind. Pack light for the kids and put all the stuff you’re not going to wear in their suitcase. Do assume that the airport will be the seventh circle of hell. Then you will be pleasantly surprised if it only turns out to be terrible. Don’t allow one person to choose the DVDs for the entire family. This meams you end up with a) wall-to-wall romcoms, or b) a box set of The Hunger Games – which, by the end of the hols, will look like a documentary, anyway. Do what David and Samantha Cameron are doing this summer and take two separate vacations instead of one long one . Who doesn’t need a mini-break to recover from their “holiday” and the kids can spend some quality time with Granny? Don’t make the elementary mistake of thinking a holiday should be relaxing. Having nothing to do and all day to do it in is much more demanding than work. If that doesn’t help, just remember the wise words of the great Tim Vine: “I’ve just been on a once-in-a-lifetime holiday. I’ll tell you what, never again.” Telegraphtravel Follow @telegraphtravel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T05:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T10:31:16.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
