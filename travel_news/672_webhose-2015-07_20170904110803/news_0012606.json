Be sure to go to the top of Sugarloaf Mountain, at 312 feet one of the highest points in Florida. It's a sight you won't want to miss. \nReaching the county's largest city — Clermont, population about 32,000 — look for the freshly repainted Citrus Tower, a vintage attraction on U.S. Highway 27 that soars as a reminder of days gone by when rows of citrus trees spread beneath it as far as the eye could see, before development took over. Visitors can go to the top of the 226-foot tower, built in 1956, for a fee: $6 for adults and $4 for children ( citrustower.com ). \nNext door is the Presidents Hall of Fame, an offbeat historical attraction that houses wax figures of the presidents, a treasure-trove of presidential memorabilia and the White House in Miniature, a 1-inch-to-1-foot scale replica of the presidential mansion that has been displayed across the globe ( thepresidentshalloffame.com ). Tickets are $15 for adults and $12 for children. \nWhile you're in the vicinity, consider a pit stop at Lakeridge Winery & Vineyards and kick back with a glass of Southern Red wine while gazing across the rolling vineyard of Muscadine grapes ( lakeridgewinery.com ). Don't snack on too much cheese while you're there so you have room for a meal at The Crooked Spoon, a gastropub known for its gourmet burgers. \nBefore you leave the area, travel 11 miles south on U.S. 27 to the Showcase of Citrus for a monster-truck ride through thousands of acres of orange groves. You'll be surrounded by the scent of oranges as you venture through the rows of trees, picking your own fruit. Don't forget to grab an orange-juice slushy or a creamsicle ( showcaseofcitrus.com ). Admission is free but orange grove rides are $25 for adults and $15 for children. \nchayes@orlandosentinel.com or 352-742-5936 \nIf you go \nWhat: Lake County sits in the center of Florida, bordering several counties, including Orange to the east, Polk to the south, Sumter to the west and Marion and Volusia to the north. \nWhere: Clermont is about 25 miles from the tourist-packed city of Orlando, 70 miles from Tampa and 80 from Daytona Beach. \nGetting there: From Orlando take State Road 408 west to Florida's Turnpike until you hit S.R. 50 west.
