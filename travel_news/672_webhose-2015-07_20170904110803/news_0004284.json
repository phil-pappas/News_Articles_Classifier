Police in Bangladesh have now arrested five people over the killing of a 13-year-old boy who was tied to a post and beaten with metal bars. Samiul Alam Rajon suffered more than 60 injuries in the attack , which was filmed and posted online by the boy's tormentors, and he died from a brain haemorrhage. The 28-minute video of Samiul, which went viral after being posted on social media, has sparked an outpouring of anger, with petitions and demonstrations demanding the attackers face the death penalty. Samiul was accused by his attackers of stealing a bicycle in the northeastern city of Sylhet although his family insist that he was innocent. Local police chief Akhter Hossain said his officers had arrested three people overnight, including the wife of one of the suspects and two men who were at the scene. Police were also hunting for \"two others who directly took part\" in the beating, Hossain told AFP. \"It's a brutal and heinous murder and we won't spare anyone,\" he added. The footage is so disturbing that the Telegraph has chosen not to publish it in full. The latest arrests bring the number of people in custody to five, including the alleged ringleader Muhit Alam and his main accomplice Kamrul Islam, who was arrested in Saudi Arabia, according to Bangladesh's foreign ministry. Islam fled to Jeddah in the immediate aftermath of the attack but reports said he was arrested by the Saudi authorities after members of the large Bangladeshi expat community in Jeddah reported him to police. In a video filmed by an expat TV station as he was led away to a waiting police car in handcuffs, Islam said that he had \"made a mistake, please forgive me,\" before bursting into tears. An autopsy on Samiul found 64 separate injuries had been inflicted on the teenager during the assault in which he could be seen begging for water. Three men from the gang look at Samiul on the floor Demonstrators formed a human chain on Monday around Samiul's home in Sylhet and a new mass demonstration in the city centre has been called for Tuesday afternoon. Similar protests have been organised for other major cities, including the capital Dhaka. In the video, the terrified youngster can be heard screaming in pain and repeating: \"Please don't beat me like this, I will die.\" One of the attackers can be heard laughing and jeering in the video as the boy begs them for mercy. His tormentors tell him to drink his own sweat when he asks for water, with one of them adding: \"His bones look intact, beat him some more.\" Samiul's attackers can also be heard in the video trying to force him to confess his involvement in the theft. It is unclear who filmed the video although police initially said they believed it was captured on smart phone by one of the attackers. Local newspaper the Dhaka Tribune has spoken to Samiul's father, who insists the boy was no thief and had been trying to support his family by selling vegetables from a rickshaw. Father Sheikh Azizur Rahman, a minibus driver, told the newspaper his son had reached Class VI before dropping out of school to help feed the family.
