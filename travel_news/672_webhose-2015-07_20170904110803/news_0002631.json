Selectify is coming up well for his return.’’\nRACE 1: SHOOT OUT MILE (1600m)\nPajaro ’s preference for Royal Randwick and his ability to handle wet tracks ranks him as the one to beat.\nThe Gai Waterhouse -trained Pajaro returned to winning form over the Randwick mile last start in heavy 10 track conditions.\n“We weren’t 100 per cent sure he would handle the very wet track at Randwick last start but he was really good and go through it well,’’ owner Greg Kolivos said.\n“I expect a similar sort of track tomorrow, we are all working on the assumption it will be very wet, and at least he has ticked that box.\n“He likes the track, he has never been out of the placings at Randwick, and he’s won over the mile. These small fields can be tricky races but fingers crossed he runs as well as last start.’’ Pajaro has never been out of the placings at Randwick.

I can’t fault him and he loves these wet tracks.’\nRACE 3: TAB PLACE MULTI HCP (1600m)\nTrainer Tony McEvoy is adamant Chastened , improved by two runs from a spell, will appreciate getting to 1600m.\n“She ran very well first-up (second to Queen Of Kariba ) at Canterbury then got too far back early (fourth to Electric Power ) at Randwick last start,’’ McEvoy said. “But those two races were too short for her as she is at her best over a mile to 2000m.\n“I’m really pleased with her progress and she gets her race tomorrow.’’ Tony McEvoy expects Chastened to shine at 1600m.

He ran very well that day and drew clear of his rivals.\n“He has had a few runs back now and is right at the top of his game. From his middle of the line draw (barrier seven) he can come across and settle not too far from the leaders.\n“I’m sure this horse will enjoy getting to 2000m and Randwick.’’\nRACE 5: ALL TOO HARD @ VINERY HCP (1100m)\nTWO impressive barrier trial efforts has Inz’n’Out primed for a winning return to racing.\nTrainer Gerald Ryan said Inz’n’Out has had a good grounding for the race and also pointed out the young sprinter is exceptional on wet tracks — two starts for two wins in soft and heavy conditions.\n“He has been in work a long time, he’s had two easy trials and races well on wet tracks so he will start,’’ Ryan said. Inz’n’Out, who has won two of his eight starts and only missed a place once, has been gelded since he was last in work.\n“It wasn’t that he was ‘colty’, he is a lovely, little horse, but we felt by gelding him now we could teach him to settle better in his races,’’ Ryan said.\nRACE 6: MICK KERR MEMORIAL HCP (1300m)\nTrainer Bjorn Baker was cautious in his appraisal of Coolring ’s chances with topweight of 60kg in heavy track conditions.\n“Coolring has drawn 10 but with a heavy track and the rail in the true position, it might be the place to be,’’ Baker said. “But I’m just mindful he is second-up and we haven’t put the blinkers back on him yet.\n“His first-up run (fifth to Two Blue ) at Rosehill was very good, and that has turned out to be a strong form race, but sometimes they can run a touch ‘flat’ second-up from a spell.\n“He’s progressed really well since that run, he is a very consistent horse and one thing about him he always puts his best foot forward.’’ Coolring has progressed well since his first-up run.

He is a very athletic type but his he is not there yet, his best days are ahead of him.’’\nRACE 8: BLEDISLOE CUP FESTIVAL HCP (1000m)\nTrainer Kris Lees has paid up for three sprinters but is likely to rely on Selectify only.\n“I probably won’t run Jimmy Says Yes first-up on a heavy track and Awasita went terribly in those conditions the other day so I’ll think about what we do with her,’’ Lees said.\n“Selectify will run and although he is first-up on a wet track, it is only a short turnaround from his last preparation. He is a big, gross stallion and he did a very good job through the autumn. He might possibly need a run but he is very effective on soft ground and he sprints well fresh.’’\nOriginally published as Lees makes triple play for more winners", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227435/106009-e1ddcbfe-25d2-11e5-97cf-8c38771465f6.jpg", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/superracing/trainer-kris-lees-makes-triple-play-for-more-winners-at-randwick/story-fni2gg7e-1227435106626", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227435/106090-194683ba-25d3-11e5-97cf-8c38771465f6.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227435/106587-3587273c-25d3-11e5-97cf-8c38771465f6.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-09T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T07:27:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
