Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Jul 29, 2015 Adv: \nWhen China Southern, a SkyTeam partner airline of Kenya Airways, launches the first scheduled flights of a Chinese airline to Nairobi, passengers destined to Guangzhou and beyond will have added choices. Kenya Airways has been flying to Guangzhou for a number of years now, with China Southern codesharing on these services, giving the two airlines access into their respective route networks out of their hubs in Nairobi and Guangzhou. \nPresently, the two airlines share seven routes, allowing each other access to added destinations in China and South Asia for Kenya Airways and beyond Nairobi for China Southern. \nIt is understood from usually well-informed sources that more codeshare destinations will be added to the deal when China Southern begins their own flights, alongside those of Kenya Airways, into Nairobi next month. Also part of the deal is the handling, passenger check-in, and for premium passengers the use of the Pride Lounge in Kenya Airways’ home terminal 1A, through which China Southern’s passengers will be processed. \nThis belies suggestions from sections of Kenya’s local media, which projected the arrival next month of China Southern as a threat to Kenya Airways’ business, clearly unaware of the level of cooperation which exists between SkyTeam members.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T02:41:08.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
