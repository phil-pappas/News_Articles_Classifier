The American Civil Liberties Union has already sued Rowan County Clerk of Court Kim Davis for refusing to issue marriage licenses. A federal judge is scheduled to hear arguments in that case on Monday.\nGov. Steve Beshear said most clerks are following the law, and the courts and the voters will deal with the rest.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
