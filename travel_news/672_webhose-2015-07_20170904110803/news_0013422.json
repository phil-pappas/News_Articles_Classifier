Assembly 30 June 2015 \nHe echoed these words during Question Time during the National Assembly session on the 30th June when he was speaking about the strategies that the ministry that he heads are working on to keep attracting visitors to Seychelles. \nMinister St.Ange said he sincerely believes that the way forward that Seychelles has adopted is working positively for the tourism industry and that it will will lead it well across the coming years. \nTalking on the strategies, he said Seychelles will continue to be promoted not only as a luxury destination but as one which is affordable and where establishments are managed by Seychellois families. \nHe said this forms part of the long-term strategies that the ministry is adopting, through the Seychelles Tourism Board which is responsible for the marketing of the islands. He also gave details on the many strategies that the Seychelles Tourism Board is working on, which he said are benefiting the industry as the statistics are showing an increase in tourist arrivals to our shores. “The proof of the pudding is in the eating, and today when we look at the performance of the Seychelles Tourism industry we have to accept that we are on the right track” Minister St.Ange said. \nThe Ministry of Tourism and Culture and the Seychelles Tourism Board remain flexible in developing new strategies depending on the trend of the tourism and world economy, he added. \n“Today, all the major international major conferences are discussing on the need to merge tourism and culture together, but Seychelles has ventured into this avenue long before,” he said. \nMinister St.Ange said plans and new strategies depend on two main elements; challenges faced by the tourism sector and secondly financial resources. \nHe spoke about the need to keep working in close partnership with members of the press, as we are a ‘press-friendly destination’. \n“Visibility is the key to market a country and we always need to find ways to remain visible,” he added. \nMinister St.Ange said air connectivity remains a vital aspect which will enable the strategies to work.
