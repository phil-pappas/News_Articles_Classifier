The annual float will be Aug. 8. \n(Brian Jones/Las Vegas News Bureau) \nMost of the year, jet skis and speedboats are common sights on the river, but the regatta is open to non-motorized watercraft such as floats, inner tubes and kayaks. Some people even build barges for the event. \nParticipants can launch between 7 a.m. and 1 p.m. from one of two locations in Bullhead City, Ariz., directly across the river from the casino enclave of Laughlin . \nFriends often travel downriver in a group by lashing their tubes together. The regatta rules allow for as many as 10 tubes to be joined as one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T17:57:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
