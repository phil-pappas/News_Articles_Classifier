But increasingly mothers are inviting their extended family and friends to join them in hospital with many venturing into the delivery room to give birthing partners a break. For women in their teens and twenties, an average of eight people are now present at some point during the birth , according to a survey by video blogging site Channel Mum. And the results also showed that childbirth is becoming increasingly public, with almost a quarter of mums sharing the experience through social media. Siobhan Freegard, founder of Channel Mum said: \"The younger generation share are used to sharing every aspect of their lives, so why not birth? Many women feel it is their biggest achievement and so want to share the moment with all of those closest to them. “The crowd-birthing phenomenon may not suit everyone but being part of the birth is an honour and privilege which unites friends and family like nothing else.” However the desire to share every aspect of childbirth is leaving many women feeling under pressure to refuse pain relief for the fear of being judged. One in five women feel opting C-section would make them feel as though they had failed at giving birth. Three in five believe birth that as birth becomes more social it is also becoming more competitive and 15 per cent feel under pressure from celebrities who have apparently sailed through labour. Supermodel Giselle Bundchen recently claimed giving birth does not hurt. Mother-in-laws are now the most popular birthing supporter after the mums partner and mother, while one in 25 chose their own dad to be present in the delivery room. The growing numbers of hospital visitors is in stark contrast to women who gave birth several decades ago, when just one person was expected to accompany them to hospital. 2,000 mothers participated in the research. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T06:06:19.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
