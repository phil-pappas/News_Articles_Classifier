Kent was left paralysed.\nMotorists posted photographs online as they sat in long queues of traffic. Allie Edmonds tweeted: “Sat on the slip road to Eurotunnel for hour and a half! Only moved twice!”, while Jonathan Quote: : “On M20 1 mile to tunnel exit. Gridlock.” Alex Francis said: “Edging closer to Eurotunnel thanks to creative rat running. Sorry Kent villages.”\nResidents said the county was so choked with traffic that many of them chose not to travel for fear of not being able to get back home.\nMeanwhile, Eurotunnel announced that “hundreds” of migrants were attempting to enter the terminal perimeter at its Coquelles base each night. On Thursday it emerged that the body of a teenager had been found on a train at the Eurotunnel terminal in Kent, the ninth migrant to die attempting to cross from France to the UK in the last two months.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Eurostar passengers at London St Pancras International face travel disruption. Photograph: Amer Ghazzal/Demotix/Corbis The latest travel chaos began when Eurotunnel was forced to briefly suspend services just before midnight on Friday after migrants targeted a French terminal point. By mid-morning passengers in Folkestone were facing delays of up to five hours.\nThe disruption meant Operation Stack, which closes the M20 between junctions 8 and 11 to hold waiting freight traffic during disruptions to cross-channel services, was once again activated and is likely to remain in place today (Sunday). “Kent is a major gateway but once again that gate is well and truly shut,” said Philip Gomm of the RAC Foundation. “Operation Stack has become the rule rather than the exception, and on one of the busiest travel weekends of the year it is causing mayhem for hauliers, holidaymakers and local residents alike.”\nOperation Stack was originally conceived as a last resort to relieve exceptional travel congestion, but has now been introduced five times in the last three weeks. Matthew Balfour, Kent county council’s cabinet member for environment and transport, said the impact of the transport chaos was “mind-boggling” and was costing the Kent economy £1.5m a day, with policing and other public services costing another £100,000 daily. Freight transport chiefs said their industry was losing £750,000 a day because of the huge problems lorry drivers had faced this summer trying to cross the channel.\n“People with shops in east Kent say trade is right down – people are not going into town because they cannot get back out again,” Balfour told the Observer.\nRelated: Channel tunnel delays after points failure and migrants storm Calais\nStuart Cradick, 47, from Hythe, who has been driving a cab in the area for 15 years, said he had seen nothing like it. “The whole area is gridlocked, totally bottlenecked. People cannot move around, shops can’t even get fresh supplies – deliveries of fresh fruit and vegetables cannot get through.”\nHe added that roads were so congested that visitors wanting to attend the War and Peace Revival military show at Folkestone racecourse were being told to get the train rather than brave the surrounding road network.\nRachel Craig, 22, from Folkestone, said the city centre was quieter than usual. “People daren’t go out in their car. I have a friend whose mum said she did not want to drive into town. It must be awful if you need to drive for work.”\nGomm of the RAC added: “Solving the immigration crisis is clearly a job for heads of government but that doesn’t mean officials here can’t do more to keep south-east England moving. The depressing thing is that cross-channel disruption is nothing new, and Operation Stack has been with us for almost 30 years. Yet only now are we seriously considering how to address its shortcomings.”\nTo cap travellers’ misery, weather forecasters issued warnings on Saturday that heavy rain and strong winds were expected to affect most of Britain on Sunday.", "external_links": ["http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Kent+trapped+in+gridlock+as+migrant+crisis+triggers+holiday+traffic+chaos&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2015%2Fjul%2F25%2Fkent-traffic-gridlock-channel-migrant-crisis-operation-stack&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F7%2F25%2F1437846649797%2F9e8d0dfd-74ab-477b-bcec-dcb091d8f4eb-2060x1236.jpeg", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4bxpj%2Fsfb%23img-2&ref=responsive", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Kent+trapped+in+gridlock+as+migrant+crisis+triggers+holiday+traffic+chaos&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4bxpj%2Fstw%23img-2"], "published": "2015-07-26T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T22:59:21.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
