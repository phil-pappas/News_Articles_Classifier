But now we don’t know anymore.”\nScientists had previously observed quill attachment points, or knobs, on the arms velociraptor fossils, but no actual feathers — meaning they did not know what type or size of plumes it would have had, or for what purpose.\n“We are lucky with Zhenyuanlong. It is found in an area where volcanoes buried dinosaurs, preserving fine details of their feathers,” Brusatte said.\n“So Zhenyuanlong tells us what the feathers of velociraptor probably would have looked like … . They would have had feathers like Zhenyuanlong and even big wings on the arms,” he said.\n“They would also have been much smaller than their reconstructed movie counterparts.\n“A real velociraptor was a little smaller than Zhenyuanlong,” Brusatte added. “It was only about the size of a poodle dog!”\nPaleontologists believe the first birds appeared 150 million years ago and were descendants of small feathered dinosaurs.", "external_links": ["http://www.nature.com/srep/"], "published": "2015-07-16T22:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T23:14:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
