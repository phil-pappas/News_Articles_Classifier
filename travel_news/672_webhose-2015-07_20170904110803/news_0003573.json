Chefs who have confirmed their participation next year include Joan Roca of three-Michelin star El Celler de Can Roca, S. Pellegrino’s world’s best restaurant for 2015; Eneko Atxa of two-Michelin star Azurmendi Restaurant in Basque; and Yoshihiro Narisawa whose three-Michelin star Les Creations de Narisawa in Tokyo was recently ranked as Asia’s 8th best restaurant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T11:14:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
