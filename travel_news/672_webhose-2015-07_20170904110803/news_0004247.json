The teams presented their projects this week to a jury at IFT’s Annual Conference in Chicago, and debated in a panel with the judges and members of all participating teams. Along with the international finalists, there were three projects from U.S. universities.\nThe winning Tico team presented a product called “Cricketas” – cookies made from powdered crickets and sweet potatoes. The project aims to improve nutrition for children in rural communities in Costa Rica’s northern zone, including Los Chiles, La Cruz, Upala and Guatuso.\nSecond place went to the Tico team that produced “Molibannann,” patties made out of plantains and mealworm larvae ( Tenebrio molitor ). The students designed the product for feeding children with malnutrition problems in Haiti.\nA team from the University Putra Malaysia took the third spot with a product called Coco-Wormy .\nIFT competition winners receive $3,000 and the runner-up gets $1,000.\nThe Ticos attendance at the competition was a real challenge as organizers only paid for travel and accommodations for one person per project. But UCR authorities campaigned to raise funds to send all group members to Chicago.\nRead about the winning projects: Costa Rican students turn larvae, crickets into nutritious meals to fight hunger\nLarva patties could help feed malnourished children in Haiti, while cookies made from crickets could help children from impoverished communities in Costa Rica’s Northern Zone.\n(Courtesy of Jessy Usaga/UCR)", "external_links": ["http://www.feedipedia.org/node/16401", "https://www.ift.org/", "http://news.ift.org/2015/07/14/2015-iftsa-student-competition-winners/"], "published": "2015-07-16T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T23:18:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
