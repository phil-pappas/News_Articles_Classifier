Hosted by the Goa government, the Union ministry for tourism has in-principle agreed to support the Youth Delphic Games 2016, and a formal proposal has been made to the government. Around 180 countries have been approached for participation while 125 countries are being targeted. \nA discussion on the organization of the Delphic Games was held at a high power committee monitoring meeting recently. Talking about the issues discussed at the HPCC meeting, Goa tourism development corporation (GTDC) chairman Nilesh Cabral told TOI that the Goa government's funding to the Games should be in proportion to the number of countries participating. Emphasis should be on greater participation. \nThe international Delphic council should ensure the presence of participants from a minimum 125 countries at the Games in order to ensure that Goa's financial support to the Delphic Games benefits the tourism industry of the state. \"I have told the HPCC that if a few countries participate in the Games then the government should cut down its financial support. I have also suggested that the government retain the Delphic Game village set up in the host country as part of the Games. The HPCC has accepted my suggestion,\" he said. \nThe HPCC has also decided to constitute an organizing committee headed by the chief secretary. \nDelphic Games is a competition of various arts, similar to and held a year before the Olympics Games. Since 1994, eight editions of the Games have been held in two formats on a four-yearly basis. \nThe Delphic Games promote art and culture through six categories of expression such as music art, performing art, language art, visual art and social art. \nThe Games, spread over 14 days, comprises 100 events in six categories and over 21 disciplines, will have over 7,000 people from over 100 countries participating in the event, HPCC members were told during the meeting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T01:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T09:38:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
