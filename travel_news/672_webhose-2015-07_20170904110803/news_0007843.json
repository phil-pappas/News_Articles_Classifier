Visit the Gyeongbokgung palace \nGyeongbokgung Palace was the seat of the Joseon Dynasty; its name means “Palace Greatly Blessed by Heaven” (Photo: Meagen Collins and Tom Williams) \nThis palace was originally constructed in 1395, but parts have been destroyed many times due to various Japanese occupations and the Korean War. Restoration to its current form began in 2009 and approximately 40 percent of the buildings have been reconstructed since then; however, some buildings from the 19th century still stand and the grounds a certainly worth a look around. \nEntry costs 3,000 won per person ($2.60 USD) and tours are offered in English, Japanese and Chinese throughout the day. We highly recommend taking the tour as the guides have some great stories and help you get a better understanding of the history of the palace. \n2. Go into history nerd overload at the Korean War Memorial and Museum \nA mosaic at the Korean War Memorial and Museum. (Photo: Meagen Collins and Tom Williams) \nThis museum is a fascinating place to learn more about the wars that have plagued Korea’s history for centuries, and also to get a better understanding of its most recent war in the 1950s—which divided the country into North and South, as we know it today. \nRelated: The Cheapest Places in Europe for Just About Anything \nThree floors contain a huge variety of information offered in a very interactive way. Outside there are impressive and moving memorial statues to admire, or you can check out old military vehicles, aircraft, and ships. This is the largest memorial of its kind in the world, and admission is free. \n3. Eat Tasty Awesome Street Food in a Street Tent \nThere are so many delicious street food options it’s hard to choose! (Photo: Meagen Collins and Tom Williams) \nFor a traditional Korean choice, try Tteokbokki (떡볶이— spicy rice cakes), which you’ll spot all over the city in a variety of street stalls. Especially on weekends, vendors will set up tents along the streets of popular party areas (such as Gangnam, Itaewon, and Hongdae), and drunken Koreans and foreigners alike will sit down for snacks, usually washed down with a bottle of soju (Korean vodka). \nThe rice cakes — which range from about $3.50 to $4 in popular areas and go down in price as you leave the party districts — are covered in a spicy red pepper paste/sauce, and the level of spice depends on the particular vendor, so try a bunch! These tents are a great place to sit have a few drinks with a late night snack, and watch a Friday or Saturday night unfold. \n4. Get Pet Snuggles Galore for the Price of a Cup of Coffee \nLove is (almost) free at Seoul’s pet cafés. (Photo: Meagen Collins and Tom Williams) \nThere isn’t a lot of room for pets in the average Seoul home so you’ll find plenty of have pet cafés where you can play with adorable animals to your heart’s content. These sorts of cafés are now springing up all over the world, but Seoul is one of the cities where they began. What’s more, they’re not limited to dog and cat cafés — you can try a reptile café and even a sheep caf é. Yep, sheep. Entry is free to the coffee shops, but you are required to buy a drink. \nRelated: Get the Purrr-fect Snack in These Cat Cafes Around the World \n5. Declare your Love at Namsan Tower \nGuests are encouraged to clip their love locks at Namsan Tower, so you won’t have to worry about the authorities cutting down your romantic gesture. (Photo: Meagen Collins and Tom Williams) \nNamsan Tower (or N Seoul Tower) is a massive landmark that rises high above the city, marking its highest point and drawing a ton of visitors. \nYou can get there either by walking (wear comfortable shoes, the amount of crazy Korean girls heading up in high heels and practically begging their boyfriends to carry them is quite ridiculous…and amusing) or by taking a cable car to the top, which will set you back 8,000 won ($6.95 USD) for a round trip. \nAt the top of the hill there is an impressive view of Seoul. There’s also one of the largest collections of “love locks” in the world. Couples come here to write messages of everlasting love on a lock, fasten theirs to the mass of other locks, and then throw away the key (preferably not over the side and onto the head of an unsuspecting pedestrian). \nRelated: The End of an Era: Paris City Officials Remove Love Locks from Pont des Arts Bridge \nIt’s best to pick up a lock before heading up as we couldn’t find anyone selling them at the top (and it’s much cheaper to buy in advance anyway). We picked up a padlock from a dollar mart type store for 2,000 won or about $2 USD. \nEven if you are not coupled up, Namsan Tower is still a great place to visit. The views are the best in town (especially at night) and at 3pm most days they have a traditional martial arts and dancing display, which is completely free to watch and offers multilingual commentary. Note: Showtimes can vary depending on the time of year. \nLet Yahoo Travel inspire you every day. Hang out with us on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , and Pinterest.
