Your government must support UK businesses by implementing the Airports Commission’s recommendation and expand Heathrow.” \nCameron has promised that the government will make a decision on airport expansion by the end of this year. There are a number of high-profile opponents of Heathrow expansion in the cabinet, including London mayor Boris Johnson. \nHeathrow’s chief executive John Holland Kaye said: “The Prime Minister showed leadership in establishing an independent Airports Commission. It unanimously concluded that expanding Heathrow is the best way of securing Britain’s future as a powerhouse in the global economy. \n“Now the Prime Minister has the opportunity to show he is serious about delivering Britain’s long-term economic plan by listening to businesses from across the UK and backing Heathrow expansion. This debate has never been about a runway – it is about the future of our country. Let’s get on with it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T13:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T05:37:52.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
