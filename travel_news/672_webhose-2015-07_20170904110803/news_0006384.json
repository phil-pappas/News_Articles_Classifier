More Bwin.party confirms offer from rival GVC \nThe decision casts doubt over the money-spinning event’s 2016 season, cutting its normal compliment of eight teams to six, reducing the value of broadcasting rights and hitting corporate sponsors of the two banned teams. \nMr Lodha’s verdict relates to allegations of illegal betting and match-fixing that erupted during the 2013 season of the scandal-prone tournament, leading to the arrest of a number of cricketers and officials linked to the two franchises. \nThe allegations created a storm of publicity at the time and led to calls for a shake-up of the game’s governing body in the country, the Board of Control for Cricket in India, which owns the television-friendly IPL. \nThe 2013 scandal focused initially on whether particular cricketers, including former Indian international S Sreesanth, had taken money from bookmakers to underperform during matches in a practice known as “spot-fixing”. \nBut the subsequent furore prompted wider criticism of India’s role at the forefront of cricketing nations, a position it holds largely because of the valuable television and sponsorship deals that followed the IPL’s launch in 2008. \n“This is an unprecedented verdict for Indian cricket,” said Ayaz Memon, a Mumbai-based cricket writer and commentator. “The IPL is probably the biggest global sporting property to emerge over the past half a century, but it has always had this nasty underbelly of corruption. Now the law seems to have caught up with it.” \nMr Lodha’s committee was set up in January following an earlier investigation that criticised both the BCCI and its powerful former chairman Narayanaswami Srinivasan for failing to take action following the 2013 season. \nTuesday’s ruling also imposed lifetime cricket bans on Chennai Super Kings official Gurunath Meiyappan and Rajasthan Royals co-owner Raj Kundra, both of whom were implicated in the scandal. The two men deny wrongdoing. \nThe unexpectedly tough verdict won blanket coverage on Indian television news, underlining how cricket is followed with an almost religious fervour in the country. \nIt follows another cricket scandal involving a heated dispute between the government and Lalit Modi, the IPL’s controversial founder. Mr Modi lives in exile in the UK, having been ousted from his role amid allegations of financial irregularities in 2010. He denies the allegations. \n“Today’s verdict has serious ramifications for the IPL,” Mr Menon said. “If it shrinks the league to six teams it will be a big blow for the broadcasters, the sponsors, even players such as Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who plays for Chennai and so might be out of work for two years.” \nTuesday’s decision is also a blow to Mr Srinivasan, who was forced to stand down as the head of the BCCI following the scandal but remains chair of the International Cricket Council, and who is often described as the most powerful person in cricket. \nMr Srinivasan is managing director of India Cements , the company that owns the Chennai Super Kings franchise, giving him a dual role that led to accusations of a conflict of interest when he was also head of the BCCI. The cricket tycoon is also Mr Meiyappan’s father-in-law.
