Maeve Higgins 30 July 2015 03:00 AM\nThe Cork funny woman (right) has just finished writing book number two, a collection of \"funny essays\" based on her travels.\n\"I just finished it last Saturday. I need to get better at describing it, but basically it's all about being away from home and living in America and London,\" she said.\nMaeve has been based in New York for just over a year, and in that time she has worked with one of her personal heroes, Amy Schumer, on the US star's Comedy Central show.\n\"I'm a huge fan of Amy's. For years I've been watching her and it was really great being on her show. Now with her film, Trainwreck, she's such a massive star and she totally deserves it,\" said Maeve.\nThe Cobh woman was back in Dublin last weekend to perform at the Vodafone Comedy Fes- tival in Iveagh Gardens, but she said she has no intentions of moving home just yet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:06:25.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
