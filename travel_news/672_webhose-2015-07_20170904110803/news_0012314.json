Brian Peery, portfolio manager for the Hennessey Cornerstone Mid-cap 30 Fund, said the airline’s stock can sky even higher as it takes market share from legacy carriers. 'I think they’ve done an exceptional job in looking at their competitive advantages and now what they’re doing is really moving upstream with the mint service,' said Peery. Peery’s Hennessey Cornerstone Mid-cap 30 Fund has returned 11% thus far in 2015. Peery is also bullish on Foot Locker (FL), up 18% year-to-date, saying the shoe-seller has performed very well in a tough retail environment. Finally, Peery is positive on Mohawk Industries (MHK), which is up over 22% so far in 2015.
