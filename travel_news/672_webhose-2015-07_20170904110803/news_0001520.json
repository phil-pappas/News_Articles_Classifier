He asks: I want to start a business in a rural area. Will I be at a disadvantage if I am not located in a large town or city? Business expert Rachel Bridge replies: In pre-internet days, being located in a rural area would have been a serious disadvantage for a small business. Not anymore. Now that a small business is no longer dependent on the number of people walking past the door to drum up business, it doesn’t really matter where you are located, as long as the broadband connection is good and you have created a striking website to entice customers to buy your products. Indeed, you may find that being a rural-based business is a real selling point for your customers, as locally sourced products that have a low carbon footprint and a traceable provenance are increasingly prized in the marketplace. There are one or two things you need to think about in advance however. If you are planning to send out the orders yourself – rather than outsourcing it to a fulfilment firm – you must also make sure you are near a thriving post office, with a backup one not too far away in case the first one closes down. Customers don’t care one bit where your business is located, but they do care about getting their order delivered on time. You also need to think about the kind of employees you are going to need. If you are going to need workers with specialist skills or training for your business, then it will be much harder to find them in a rural setting than in a large town or city, so you may need to consider training up the staff you need yourself. The other big factor you need to think about is how often you are going to need to travel for meetings with suppliers, investors, partners, large customers and so on. If you are rurally-based, people will not come to see you, so you need to make sure you are located near good transport links and that it will not take you all day just to attend a single meeting, otherwise your business may suffer. Cat Elliot, senior partner recruitment manager at Notonthehighstreet.com , an online marketplace for independent retailers, adds: One of the huge advantages of online retail is that small businesses can be located almost anywhere. As long as they have an internet connection, they can still find an effective route to market to showcase their products. In particular, online marketplaces allow entrepreneurs to access customers and marketing opportunities which are truly international, often for an extremely reasonable cost. Notonthehighstreet.com is the home of over 5,000 of the UK and Ireland’s best creative businesses, with our sellers shipping their beautifully made products from their kitchen tables or garden sheds from the very tip of Scotland to the fringes of Cornwall to over 150 countries worldwide. Crucial to all of this is regional businesses finding delivery solutions that not only work for them, but that are also effective and speedy to get customers what they’ve ordered safely. One of our most successful sellers on notonthehighstreet.com is located in a very small village in the country, and her business arguably singlehandedly keeps a local post office in business because of the volume of packages she is sending on a daily basis. How new start-ups pitch their business and product ideas has also changed, with owners no longer having to rely on wholesale orders from large bricks-and-mortar stores or trailing briefcases of samples around to regional shops. Notonthehighstreet.com sellers generate millions of pounds worth of online orders direct from customers, all from the comfort of local premises. • Run a business in the countryside?
