States can bring some improvement in any central legislation on issues falling within the ambit of concurrent list. It is done. The President gives assent to their laws. There are many instances, where it has happened. There are many such laws,” he said, adding that the proposal will only be sent by the Central government to the President for his assent.\n“Moreover, the President’s assent will happen through us. The state government’s Act goes to President through the concerned ministry. Of course, the President is the final authority. There may also be special circumstances from state to state. If any provision is in the interest of the state, the President gives assent,” he said.\nAsked whether he is hopeful that the bill will be passed during the Monsoon session, Singh parried a direct answer.\n“It all depends on the Joint Committee report. I feel that it will come by August 3 as the panel was given extension till then. If there is a unanimity and consensus in this report, then I think that the bill will be passed,” he said.\nAmid indications of Samajwadi Party warming up to the government, the minister indicated that barring Congress other parties are not saying no to any amendment.\n“I feel that other parties may have some reservations against few things in the bill. But they are not saying do not bring any amendment in the 2013 law. Only the Congress party has this mindset,” he said.\nSingh also parried a question on whether the government will promulgate the land ordinance for the fourth time if no consensus is arrived.\n“We will see that later. There is still time for ordinance,” he said.\nIndications are that deliberations in the panel could continue for some more time as the government is unlikely to push for the passage of the bill before Assembly elections in politically crucial Bihar, an agrarian state.\nThe rural development minister said that whatever good suggestions come in the interest of farmers through the committee, Government will certainly try to implement them.\n“But, we definitely want the process for the acquisition to be speeded up. This is our prime concern,” Singh said.\nTargeting the Congress Vice President, he said, “Rahul Gandhi’s remarks that we will not allow even an inch of land to be taken has no meaning. This can only be a political speech. Our bill is aimed at making the 2013 law applicable. If farmers have to be given any benefit of that law, then some shortcomings in it have to be rectified.\n“If there is no modification, then the Act will be non- functional. So saying such a thing is not in sync with democratic norms. There is some lack of understanding of democracy on part of Rahul when he says this.”\nThe Union Minister, who has had a long association with Congress before he joined BJP last year and became a minister, suggested that there are multiple voices in Congress over the issue.\n“Yes that is there. When they were in power, Congress ruled states Maharashtra, Kerala and Haryana said this Act required amendments to make it functional and applicable.\n“But as soon as they were out of power, they are now saying that we are not ready for any amendment. This is political opportunism,” he said.\nSingh said this replying to a question on whether he thinks that Congress has multiple views on the issue and Rahul is alone driving the party to take the strident stand.\nThe minister pointed out that Congress continued for over 50 years with the same 1894 Act for acquisition of land even-though it had many lacunae.\n“And when they made the new law in 2013, they did it in a hurry. It was not aimed at doing away with the lacunae of the old law and was brought due to political reasons keeping in mind the 2014 Lok Sabha election,” he said.\nInsisting that there should be “pragmatism” in ideas, the Minister said “a party which rules the country for for 50-55 years and thinks of governing the country even in future should have maturity in thinking.\n“It should be pragmatic. Making absurd remarks out of frustration and desperation to somehow come out of the impact of poll drubbing does not suit any pan-India, national party in the country. Such a party should not think on these lines in a democracy,” he said.\n 26, 2015 10:24 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T18:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T14:04:40.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
