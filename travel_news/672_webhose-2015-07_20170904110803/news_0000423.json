Romero Lodge, which sits on the banks of the Manu River, will offer fair employment to local communities and, through tourism, help crees to achieve its goal of protecting the local environment, securing a sustainable future for the region. \nBrilliantly located within the Manu National Park and surrounded by primary rainforest, it is an ideal base from which to explore the nearly oxbow lakes which are home to giant river otters, black caiman and extensive birdlife. It comprises eight spacious bedrooms which are finished and furnished to a high-standard and have en-suite bathrooms with hot showers. Visitors travelling to Manu can book a stay at Romero Lodge independently (either directly through crees or via their travel agent) or while enjoying one of crees’ tours. The three to 10-night tours are led by crees’ highly specialist guides and range from eco-adventures to photography trips, wildlife experiences and tailor-made explorations of the local area. The tours also include an overnight stay at the Manu Learning Centre – the research centre and central hub of the crees foundation. The Manu Biosphere Reserve is a UNESCO World Heritage site and is home to the Manu National Park. The reserve has the highest level of biodiversity in the world. It is home to more than 15,000 plants species and over 1,000 species of birds.
