This expands ongoing cooperation between two of the world’s largest airplane manufacturers.\nFrederico Curado, president and CEO of Embraer, and Marc Allen, president of Boeing International, signed a Memorandum of Understanding at the Brazil-U.S. Business Summit organized by the Brazil-U.S. Business Council. The business summit, hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, occurred during an official visit by Brazil’s President Dilma Rousseff with U.S. President Barack Obama.\nBoeing launched its ecoDemonstrator Program in 2011 to accelerate testing and use of new technologies that can reduce fuel use, carbon emissions and noise. The company has so far tested more than 50 technologies with a Next-Generation 737-800, 787 Dreamliner and, currently, a 757. Through their collaboration, Boeing and Embraer are planning to conduct ecoDemonstrator tests with an Embraer airplane in 2016.\n“Innovation is a key pillar of Embraer’s strategy, and we are pleased to continue our work with Boeing to support the long-term sustainable growth of our industry,” said Curado. “The ecoDemonstrator Program offers a new and valuable opportunity for collaboration between our companies to boost environmental development tests, benefiting customers, our industry and the society.”\n“Industry leadership in today’s world requires creative and global collaborations that ignite progress on hard problems faster than ever,” said Allen. “Boeing and Embraer are both industry leaders committed to addressing aviation’s environmental goals through innovation and technology. Working together in this exciting new way, our companies will speed progress to improve aviation’s efficiency and reduce environmental impact.”\nThe ecoDemonstrator cooperation between Boeing and Embraer advances a relationship that began in 2012 when the manufacturers announced they would cooperate in ways that create value for both companies and their customers. Since then, the manufacturers have worked together to improve runway safety and support Embraer’s KC-390 defense aircraft program.\nIn addition, in 2015, Boeing and Embraer opened a joint biofuel research center in São José dos Campos, Brazil, to perform biofuel research and coordinate research with Brazilian universities and other institutions.\nBoeing has worked with suppliers, airlines and government agencies on previous ecoDemonstrator flight tests. Those technologies include a new winglet and “bug-phobic” wing coatings that can improve aerodynamic efficiency, software applications that can improve in-flight efficiency and new types of sustainable aviation biofuel.\nEmbraer incorporates environmental requisites into product development through its Environmentally Sustainable Products Program (DIPAS). Embraer aircraft are designed with an emphasis on incorporating innovations and adhering to environmental norms. With the ecoDemonstrator platform, new technologies under development that can lessen environmental impact are tested in flight and mature faster.\nSource:- Boeing\nRelated Posts Norwegian announced three long-haul routes to America Chelsea Football Club Hosts Leaders Sport Summit 2013, the world’s most Prestigious Sport Business Summit Boeing, TUI Group Finalize Order for 787-9 Dreamliner Qatar Executive To Exhibit At Leading Business Aviation Show In Dubai Boeing, Air Europa Announce Order for 14 787-9 Dreamliners", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T16:06:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
