But Britain has so much more to offer, from the Cornish Riviera to the Scottish Highlands and everything in between. \n“For many areas tourism is a key industry bringing jobs, growth and security for working people. Tourism supports almost one in 10 jobs in the UK and we want to rebalance the economy to make sure this boost is felt right across the country.” \nThe five areas that the government’s new group will tackle are: improving the co-ordination of the UK’s “fragmented” tourism industry, boosting the image of tourism as a “fulfilling and long-term career” to attract and retain more employees, increasing “common sense” regulations, creating more links between tourist attractions and the transport network, and improving standards and service at the UK Border entry points. \nCameron has also announced a £1 million Rail for Tourism competiton, which will ask for ideas on how the UK rail network can be made more attractive to tourists for exploring more of the country. \nJohn Whittingdale added: “Tourism is a vital industry that brings jobs and growth to local economies across Britain. There are so many world-class things to see and do in the UK, and we need to make sure visitors are experiencing as many of them as possible. \n“I am delighted to chair this new group, which will put tourism at the heart of government and help to ensure that every part of the UK benefits by co-ordinating action across government.” \nVisit England’s chief executive James Berresford attended the launch of the new strategy with David Cameron. \n“Placing tourism at the heart of government will do much to support plans to rebalance the economy,” said Berresford. \n“We will work closely with the new inter-ministerial group and our partners across the country to deliver on these commitments and drive growth across the regions by showcasing and developing the standout product on offer in this country to key domestic and international markets.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T14:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T14:27:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
