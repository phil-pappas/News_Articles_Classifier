Jessica Arnott says she has no regrets about “playing my cards a different way.” Source: Supplied\nTaking a safer, “more nostalgic” road to this season’s decider, grand finalists Georgia Barnes and Billie McKay plated up more food memories and won praise and the sentimental vote for their disciplined and consistent execution in the kitchen.\nIn a sensational episode, all three amateurs served up some of the most accomplished dishes of the series so far:\n* Georgia serving a main of cured trout with flavours of apple and cucumber; followed by a dessert of mango sorbet, vanilla yoghurt parfait and macadamia chilli praline, with chilli salt and coriander;\nSweet ... Georgia Barnes' mango sorbet with vanilla yoghurt parfait, macadamia chilli praline and chilli salt and coriander.

Billie McKay's dill and rhubarb spider. Picture: Channel 10 Source: Supplied\n* Jessica impressed with her main course of roast pork belly, with Japanese flavours of shiso, dashi smoked yoghurt and roast quince; but it was the adventurous spirit of Arnott who lost out for her final showstopper which consisted of a dusted white chocolate dome filled with grapefruit centre, mousse, popcorn sponge with crumble and Heston Blumenthal -style popping candy.\nWhile the judges heaped praise on Arnott’s main course, Matt Preston led criticism of her dessert, finding fault with the density of her sponge element and questioning the flavour combination of sour and savoury.\nBittersweet ... Jessica Arnott's grapefruit and popcorn dessert. Picture: Channel 10 Source: Supplied\nWhile disappointed at falling just short with the dish, Arnott told News Corp she had no regrets about “playing my cards a different way.”\n“I pushed the boat our a little bit and made a couple of little mistakes which were enough to send you home at this stage of the competition. In hindsight, I could have played it safe ...(the judges) love food that pulls at the heart strings, but I tried to do something that was out of my comfort zone. There’s no way I could have made that (dessert) at the beginning of the competition, so I’m proud of how far I’ve come.”\nFood lovers ... judges Matt Preston, George Calombaris and Gary Mehigan enjoying the semi-final fare. Picture: Channel 10 Source: Supplied\n“I tried to do something that made me stretch myself and I don’t regret that,” she said.\nIt leaves Barnes and McKay to battle it out in a grand final with a State-Of-Origin flavour, with Arnott admitting she was envious of their final kitchen challenge: a monumental recipe by Heston Blumenthal.\n“I was definitely jealous watching the finale. There are elements of envy but it looked by far the hardest dish of the competition and I would have loved to have a crack at it.”\nArnott remains focused on her goal of opening her own cheese and charcuterie bar, but is happy gaining experience on a casual basis at a similar concept cafe, The Flower Factory in Perth.\n“It’s really up my alley, but I also want to keep my options open for any other opportunities that could come from MasterChef.”\nholly.byrnes@news.com.au\nTwitter: @byrnesh\nWHO WILL WIN MASTERCHEF — BILLIE OR GEORGIE?
