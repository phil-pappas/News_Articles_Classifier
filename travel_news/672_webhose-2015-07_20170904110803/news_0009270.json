We’ve got all bases covered.”\nThe Test pitch at Edgbaston, the Birmingham headquarters of county side Warwickshire, had a decent covering of grass when the covers were removed on Monday.\nHead groundsman Gary Barwell (second from left) alongside head coach Trevor Bayliss (L), England captain Alastair Cook and assistant coach Paul Farbrace at Edgbaston.

I don’t want to face that stuff,” Starc said.\nEngland have rejigged their line-up in a bid to avoid the kind of top-order collapse that has seen them three wickets down for 43 or fewer runs seven times in their last 13 Test innings.\nGary Ballance has been dropped and replaced by Yorkshire teammate Jonny Bairstow, who is averaging over 100 in county cricket this season.\nBairstow is set to bat at number five with the struggling Ian Bell due to take Ballance’s place at number three.\n“Anytime you have got the opposition changing line-ups you are in a good spot,” said Starc.\nOriginally published as England’s bizarre Ashes tactic", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/28/1227459/630683-6a99ef84-34a8-11e5-9c8f-aecce85b5e15.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/englands-spaced-out-preparation-for-third-ashes-test-at-edgbaston/story-fnu2penb-1227459631658"], "published": "2015-07-28T15:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T01:52:42.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
