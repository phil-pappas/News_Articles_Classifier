The buyer's offer: 10,000 euros.\nCiudad Real's Central airport, about 235 kilometres (150 miles) south of Madrid, became a symbol of the country's wasteful spending during a construction boom that ended with the financial crisis of 2008, the year the airport opened. The operator of the airport went bankrupt in 2012 after it failed to draw enough traffic.\nChinese group Tzaneen International tabled the single bid in Friday's auction, Spanish news agency Europa Press said. The receiver had set a minimum price of 28 million euros. If no better bid is received by September, the sale will go through, the news agency said.\nTzaneen International reportedly plans to invest up to 100 million euros in the airport and make it a cargo hub. The offer is for the airport infrastructure only, not adjacent land.\nCentral has one of Europe's longest runways and was designed to handle 2.5 million passengers a year.\nThe construction was heavily funded by the Caja Castilla La Mancha savings bank — the first of Spain's troubled savings banks to be bailed out, in 2010.\nAnother largely unused airport and symbol of wasteful spending is Castellon, on Spain's eastern coast. It cost around 150 million euros and opened in 2011.\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T02:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T07:47:27.091+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
