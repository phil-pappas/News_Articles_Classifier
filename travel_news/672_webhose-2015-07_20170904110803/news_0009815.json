Recent research from recruitment company Robert Half found that 14pc of finance leaders say their workforce is less motivated during the summer months and another recent survey suggested that 25pc of British workers claim to work hard only one day a week during this period. Here’s our guide on how to make your business more productive in the summer... Plan ahead Plan for the hot weather while it’s cold, says Adrian Lewis, commercial director of Activ Absence, “If you have spent money on fans and air conditioning for your staff that haven't been used since last summer, test them all in late February so you know they are all going to be working in the event of a heatwave.” Have a system for managing a sudden increase in leave requests. “How will you cope if, say, all your fork-lift drivers want to take the same days off?” says Mr Lewis. “Make sure your staff know what your leave policies are.” He adds, “We know that staff tend to take sickies for summer sporting events. Canny managers can turn staff interest in these outside events into an opportunity to build team morale instead by letting staff listen to the match on the radio and bringing in food that day - for example, strawberries in Wimbledon season, or getting everyone involved in a “best hat for Ascot” contest.” Put the hours in first Sue Higgins, founder and managing director of business growth consultancy Inspira, says, “Clear the decks. Get all your admin and paperwork out of the way now before the summer holidays. Make sure your documentation is logically filed so that if you are going away this summer, colleagues can easily find the information they need. If you are planning on getting away from it all, don’t forget to tell important clients and suppliers when you will be out of the business.” Care for your tech Good office design can help eliminate temperature-related problems from the word go. Ensure all windows can be opened, have built-in air-conditioning and fans, and situate workstation areas out of direct sunlight and away from heat sources. Gareth Poppleton, MD of Retail Merchant Services, says, “If you’re a SME retailer, with GPRS or wireless payment terminals you can move to the more cooler parts of your premises or location to make sales. Don’t be limited by the traditional retail layouts, and get creative and find a sales process that works for both you and your customers, perhaps a pop-up shop in the shade?” Bend on breaks Adopt a more flexible attitude to rest breaks, says Peter Ames, head of operations at office space search engine, OfficeGenie.co.uk . “No one is at their most productive when they are stuck sweltering behind their desk.” Good office design makes this easier. Make use of breakout or outside space and flexible working. Appreciate the silence With many employees off on holiday, take advantage of a quieter office to focus on high-level strategy, says Andrew Filev, founder and CEO of work management platform Wrike. He adds, “If you find yourself or your team more prone to window gazing, don’t fight it. Letting your mind wander boosts creativity, since your brain has space to simply observe, reflect and make new connections.” For more advice on preparing your business for the tech challenges of the future, visit HP BusinessNow Discover more tips and advice for SMEs: • How you can protect your business • What do micropayments mean for SMEs? • Online payment advice for SMEs • Urica: a quick fix for slow payments? • Top 10 cashflow tips for SMEs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T22:48:15.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
