The thinking was that if the economy picked up, amusement parks would start to do well again. There are many entertainment choices for middle-income folks, and parks run by Walt Disney ( DIS ) are certainly one choice. Cedar Fair had more parks, however, and they were more affordable. \nDuring the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, lots of consumers cut back on discretionary spending, as they tend to do during recessions and times of sluggish economic growth. That's spending on nonessential items that aren't necessary for survival, and it typically includes travel. \nThe stocks of theme parks, hotels and airlines got whacked. \nMust Read: The 10 Best Cities for First-Time Homebuyers \nCedar Fair, which owns and operates 11 theme parks, four water parks and five hotels, struggled during the Great Recession . In 2009, combined attendance at its parks fell nearly 7% to 21.1 million from 22.7 million in 2008. \nIn turn, revenue fell $80.1 million, or 8%, in 2009, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, slumped 16% to $299.9 million. \nThe company also had a high debt load. At the end of 2008, long-term debt was $1.72 billion, and the company paid $129.6 million to service it that year. \nCedar Fair risked violating debt covenants and ending up in default. By March 2009, the stock had fallen to $6. That was down about 50% from its 2008 low of about $12. Shares had spent much of the first half of 2008 at more than $20. \nIf only Cedar Fair could recapitalize and enjoy some improvement in consumer spending. Against the wishes of shareholders, Cedar Fair's management approached private equity shop Apollo Global Management ( APO ) for a buyout . In December 2009, Apollo offered $11.50 a share to take the company private, a nearly 30% premium to the stock price at the time. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T18:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T18:32:41.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
