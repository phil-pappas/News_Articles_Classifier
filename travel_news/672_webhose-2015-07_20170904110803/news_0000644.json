Coppola joins Cher, Winona Ryder, Debi Mazar, Willow Smith, and others in the star-studded ads, which Jacobs has been releasing intermittently on his Instagram over the past month. Jacobs “leaked” the shot of Coppola last night—before it was debuted on the brand’s official social media page—and proceeded to explain his relationship with the director. “It was love at first sight for me!” the designer wrote, adding that Coppola “represented everything I am drawn to: talent, style, creativity, a unique ‘vision and voice.’” [ Instagram ]\nMoschino’s CEO steps down…\nAlessandro Varisco has stepped down from his role as CEO at Moschino. Varisco has been with the brand since 2009 and is reportedly leaving to take a role at Twin-Set Simona Barbieri, an Italian womenswear brand. Massimo Ferretti, executive president of Aeffe Group, Moschino’s parent company, said, “We thank Alessandro Varisco for his profuse contribution over the years and for the goals he reached.” [ WWD ]\nGrace Jones breaks her own rules…\nGrace Jones announced she is writing a memoir—even though the model-musician once vowed to never do so. In her 1981 track “Art Groupie,” the opening lyric stated, “I’ll never write my memoirs.” Still, we’re glad she changed her mind. “That was a long time ago. Since then, I thought, ‘If I don’t do it, somebody else will,’” she said. [ i-D ]\nEven more Dior…\nIf you didn’t manage to catch Dior and I while it was playing in theaters, you’re in luck—the documentary was released on iTunes today. The film, directed by Frédéric Tcheng, chronicles the lead-up to Raf Simons’ debut runway show as creative director of Dior. Not only will the iTunes version give you all the feels we chronicled in our review , but it is also accompanied by several bonus features, including a collection of 132 exclusive images and commentary by the film’s director. [ Complex ]\nThe Met’s China exhibit extends its stay...\nIn its first eight weeks of being open, China: Through the Looking Glass has attracted more than 350,000 visitors to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
