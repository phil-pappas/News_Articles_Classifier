There’s a lively music and arts scene which reaches its peak in the summer. Next month is the Pittenweem Arts Festival (1-9 August, pittenweemartsfestival.co.uk ) at which dozens of artists open their studios and homes to the public.\nWhat to do \nWander the galleries, shops and harbours of the villages of Pittenweem, Anstruther and Crail, all linked by the scenic Fife Coastal Path with its bracing views of the Firth of Forth ( fifecoastalpath.co.uk ). From Anstruther catch a boat to the Isle of May nature reserve, home to seals, rabbits and puffins. Spend a day on Elie Earlsferry’s beach with its dunes and beach huts and visit Kingsbarns Distillery for whisky tours and tastings ( kingsbarnsdistillery.com ). St Andrews, with its cathedral, university, botanic gardens, pier and beach, is up the coast, and no mention of Fife would be complete without including its world-class golf courses ( visitscotland.com ).\nWhere to eat \nThe rooftop terrace at the East Pier Smokehouse in St Monans is the place to enjoy crab cakes, lobster with chips, whole smoked sea bass, or mackerel, with dreamy views across to the Isle of May ( eastpier.co.uk ).\nWhere to stay \nUnique Cottages has fishermen’s houses for rent, from £295 for a week at Sea Breeze, a cosy, waterfront cottage in St Monans which sleeps two ( unique-cottages.co.uk ).\nInsider tip \nCrispin Heath of East Neuk Outdoors activity centre ( eastneukoutdoors.co.uk ) recommends tackling the Chain Walk from the end of Elie beach. “It’s a kind of via ferrata with chains and footholds. It’s an exciting scramble and takes an hour to 90 minutes for an active person to complete.”\nGive me a break\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Creature comforts: Notting Hill’s new Laslett Hotel.
