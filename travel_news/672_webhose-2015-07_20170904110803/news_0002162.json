The main driver behind the setup of the academy is business growth and the ability to recruit and train Travel Executives for all of TAG’s divisions at both Higher Education (HE) and Further Education (FE) levels. \nThe Appointment Group Global Training Academy, through a series of assessment days at colleges, recruited seven individuals in May 2015. The students have already achieved an academic qualification in business practice travel qualifications and GDS skills, these qualifications range from Levels 1-3 City and Guilds. TAG worked with 12 key suppliers to create a varied programme including product experiential days, classroom and online training. Furthermore our suppliers played an active role in the development of the TAG Travel Practice text book which supports the learning process of the trainees. The educational programme developed with our partner colleges is fully engaged with their curriculum in order to successfully prepare the trainees to become fully skilled TAG Travel Executives within the duration of the programme. The division will welcome its first class on Tuesday 1st of September in conjunction with the official launch of the Academy. This project is managed by Lesley Adams, Company Trainer at The Appointment Group. Lesley has over 30 years’ experience in leading and managing strategic and operational capability development interventions such as learning, training, development and coaching.
