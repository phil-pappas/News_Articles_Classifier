However, out in the open country, where the noise of traffic and fellow humanity has less relevance to personal welfare, an album can act as a sonic endorsement to a hearty stroll. The music required for such an exercise must be, by turns, invigorating and mellow, containing enough lightness and space to allow contemplation of majestic views, blending with nature, yet with enough drama to give the occasion its own personal theatre. These six albums will invigorate solo ramblers, from the Sunday afternoon wanderer to the traverser of mountains. Pink Floyd Atom Heart Mother (EMI) The pre-‘Dark Side of the Moon’ Pink Floyd are an under-explored entity but this chart-topping 1970 outing is rich and fascinating, combining prog histrionics with musical accessibility to just the right degree. Its opening 24 minute cod-classical suite will turn a stroll around the headlands into your own epic movie and the other four songs boast a hazy and very English charm that will, admittedly, work best if the sun is high in the sky. • Pink Floyd's 14 studio albums rated McCoy Tyner Expansions (Blue Note/UMC) Jazz for tramping up and down steady gradients needs to offer solace and ease, but not so much the physical activity at hand makes it irrelevant. Philadelphia pianist McCoy Tyner had been to the atonal fringes of jazz as a member of John Coltrane’s band in the early Sixties, but cutting out on his own, he chose a balance between modal hard bop and the sounds then popular in more mainstream jazz. His 1968 ‘Expansions’ album has a twitchy energy and groove, but is also sweet on the ear. Nick Mulvey First Mind (Fiction) Nick Mulvey began his career in crossover jazz outfit the Portico Quartet and last year’s debut solo album retains that band’s musical optimism and attention to detail. He’s a singer-songwriter but far rom the usual sub-James Taylor bleating. His Latin-flavoured guitar-picking is adapted to an almost modernist classical style with results that are compellingly emotive, yet retain a driving onward propulsion, gentle yet sturdy, just right for windswept contemplation on the South Downs, the Chilterns, the Ridgeway, or similar. • UK walking holidays: 10 best British hikes Various Artists The Best of Rachmaninov (Naxos) Naxos are sometimes criticised for their budget classical collections, but this double album set is a robust selection that runs the gamut from the Royal Philharmonic to various East European orchestras. More to the point, it’s programmed in a way that allows the sensory worldview of the last great Russian romantic composer to swell and explode before retreating to tranquility, like a musical tide, a rise and fall most apt for conquering each promontory and knoll. • Britain's favourite classical music: Rachmaninov piano concerto The Byrds The Notorious Byrd Brothers (Columbia) There was always something pastoral about The Byrds and, following this 1968 album, they blossomed into a fully realised country rock outfit (much to their fans bemusement). In the meantime, the psychedelic tint throughout ‘The Notorious Byrd Brothers’ is redolent of wide open spaces, the harmonies and jangling guitar were never lovelier, and America’s answer to The Beatles prove to be a country rambler’s dream. Mungolian Jet Set We Gave It All Away… Now We Are Taking It Back (Smalltown Supersound) As usual, our last recommendation is for the more adventurous. Mungolian Jet Set are a cult Norwegian outfit who combine disco and electronica with something much earthier and more tribal. Their unique fusion sound pulses and bubbles, spacey but warm, as if club music had been redesigned at a steady strolling gait. This double album collection from 2009 mingles remixes with original tunes, the whole thing adding up to an odyssey and one for a really long, purposeful hike. • The only driving albums you'll ever need • Baking cupcakes?
