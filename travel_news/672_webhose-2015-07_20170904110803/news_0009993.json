With China driving the world economy, Chinese may become the working language much like when people were willing to learn Japanese when the country was an economic powerhouse.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T17:17:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
