No figures were available for Tibet overall.\nHundreds of Uighurs were detained last year for illegally entering Thailand, fleeing what rights groups say is religious persecution in China. The Uighurs claimed to be Turkish citizens, and 181 have been allowed to go to Turkey, with more than 100 others sent back to China.\nMeanwhile, mainland Chinese travellers took more than 100 million “outbound” trips last year, according to government figures, although most visited Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.\n“It’s clearly not the case that the state is having massive difficulties issuing passports to some people,” Richardson said. “You would think that capacity would be spread evenly across ethnic groups but that doesn’t seem to be the case.”\nRelated Posts Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium China’s railways record 231 million holiday trips U.S. Tourism Misses Golden Opportunity with Chinese Visitors Siem Reap cynosure of developers’ eyes as tourism hub", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T03:06:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
