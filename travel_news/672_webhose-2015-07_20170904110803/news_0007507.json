The month-long festival, celebrated each year in the Scottish capital, is the largest arts festival in the world. In fact, Palat found encouragement for her craft at this festival. “At Edinburgh, we won the best play in 2008 amongst 36,500 other plays,” she adds. \nNow, with YouTheatre, Palat wants to provide a platform for hidden talent and recreate the experience by bringing people together. This three-day festival, to be held in September, will be a celebration of dance, drama, music, poetry and art. “As we grow older, life takes over and we realise that we don’t have an outlet to express ourselves anymore,” she says. Under the banner of her company, Balancing Act, Palat has also collaborated with True School of Music and Shiamak Davar’s Institute of Performing Arts to organise workshops during the festival. While YouTheatre is open to all, Palat intends to focus on working professionals who are stuck in their cubicles and seldom find an opportunity to showcase their creativity. \n“I want to encourage corporates to allow their employees to participate,” she says. She is currently doing the rounds of offices scouting for talent. “At one of the offices, I heard that someone was incredible at stand-up comedy. I feel cheated when we are not made aware of talent,” she concludes. \nThe festival will be held from September 11 to 13 at various venues across south Mumbai. Registrations are open till July 15.
