It’s a trend Terry Slaybaugh , director of aviation for the city-owned airport, expects to continue. That’s critical because during the last three years, Dayton lost seats as airlines consolidated. Fewer options forced consumers to look at other airports, which hurt Dayton’s traffic. Now we’ve hit the point where Dayton is starting to put more people into fewer available seats than a year ago. That shows the strength of this market, Slaybaugh said, which is something will make the airlines take notice. In other words, declining traffic was a short-term condition and we can expect airlines to put more seats into Dayton as they get more planes and work through the pilot shortage. By all accounts, Dayton is doing relatively well for a market its size, bolstered by the expansion of PSA Airlines . “When you look around at the other airports like our airport, we have pretty robust service and we have a very strong business community here that supports the airport.” Slaybaugh said. “I don’t feel like our market is being singled out.” Getting more service to Dayton International will be a big deal because the airport is a substantial driver of the regional economy. A strong airport helps attract and retain businesses while providing jobs and business opportunities. Last month, Slaybaugh attended a major airline trade event to get in front of carriers and lobby them to add flights or begin operations here. For example, he pitched Spirit Airlines for a flight from Dayton to Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. because that airline has extensive service there to the Caribbean, Central America and South America. Dayton officials also pitched Allegiant Air on several markets in Florida and Southwest Airlines about adding flights to Houston and Chicago. “We just try to stay in front of them, try to gather intelligence to figure out what they’re doing and whether we can hope for any more service here,” he said. More good news: Despite the 9 percent decline in traffic for the first half of 2015, revenues at the airport remained flat. That means the facility is generating revenue needed to operate and still plan for improvements. “It’s easy to get lost in the (numbers from the) last 36 months, but that will change during the next 36 months,” Slaybaugh said. \nWant Dayton Logistics & Transportation news in your inbox?
