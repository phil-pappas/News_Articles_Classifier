Many of the world's most fascinating places are in the midst of change due to the transforming environment, political shifts and tourism patterns, says Bill Abbott , president and founder of Wilderness Travel , which leads tours to many threatened hot spots. \"It's happening faster than you think and there are a lot of things you need to see right away if you want to see them,\" he says. The lifelong traveler shares some top places at risk with Larry Bleiberg for USA TODAY.\nCuba\nThe Communist country is poised for enormous shifts as the U.S. makes moves to end its half-century economic embargo. And while the country won't be transformed overnight, huge plans are already in place. Abbott, who grew up in Latin America, visited recently. \"It was like stepping back in time to the Caribbean of 50 years ago,\" he says. \"It's already changing.\" The U.S. State Department still limits tourism, but it's already easier for Americans to visit. havana.usint.gov\nUSA TODAY\nCruise giant Carnival Corp. to launch sailings to Cuba\nChoquequirao, Peru\nWhile Machu Picchu is still a stunning site with thousands of daily visitors, it's a far cry from the lost Incan city travelers once enjoyed. Choquequirao may suffer a similar fate if plans go through to build a cable car to the isolated ruin, which is now only reachable by a two-day trek. \"Even today there are rarely any more than 25 or 30 people there at maximum. It's like going to Machu Picchu and being the only group there. And those days are potentially over,\" Abbott says. peru.travel\nGlacier National Park, Mont.\nThis wilderness area on the Canadian border is rapidly changing, with ice fields shrinking every year. The park, which had 150 glaciers in 1850, is down to just 25 masses large enough to be considered glaciers. Scientists predict it will have none by 2030. \"It's almost gone. It will be Glacier in name only soon,\" Abbott says. 406-888-7800; nps.gov/glac\nDolpo, Nepal\nAs global travel grows, it's becoming more difficult to escape the developed world. Abbott recently spent five weeks trekking in this remote Nepalese region of high mountains and deep canyons -- an experience that may be difficult to replicate in coming years. \"For the first three weeks, we didn't meet any Westerners,\" he says. Although Abbott's company and a few others occasionally offer tours, he anticipates more are on the horizon. welcomenepal.com\nMount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania\nThe snows of Kilimanjaro that inspired author Ernest Hemingway are nearly gone. Researchers say the mountain has lost 85% of its ice cover in the last century, and it likely will all be gone by 2040. \"In the time we've been running trips there in the last 25 years, we've seen a huge retreat of the glaciers,\" Abbott says. tanzaniaparks.com\nCoral Triangle\nThis Pacific region including Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines has the last great reserves of healthy coral reefs, Abbott says. Rising temperatures are already bleaching out colors in the Caribbean region. But the Coral Triangle still is thriving. \"The snorkeling is incredible,\" he says. \"Because the currents are cold water, they've mostly avoided the bleaching.\" mycoraltriangle.com\nGreenland\nWhile the northern island is still an emerging tourism destination, it's rapidly changing. Wide sections of ice are deteriorating as rivers and sinkholes undermine the surface. \"This is a huge problem. There's some great hiking on the Northern Ice Cap\" at risk, Abbott says. greenland.com\nMadagascar\nThe African island nation, colonized by the French and familiar to a generation of fans of the animated Dreamworks movie series of the same name, has seen threats to populations of its iconic lemurs. The precocious primates are suffering due to drought, forest fires and growing human population. \"They're doing their best to preserve resources, but there are all sorts of pressures on the forested areas,\" Abbott says. madagascar-tourisme.com\nKiribati\nParts of several Pacific islands nations may literally disappear in the next century due to rising sea levels. Kiribati has taken direct action, arranging to resettle population to Fiji. Tuvalu is also making contingency plans. New research suggests a few islands may actually grow due to build-up of sediments. Still, Abbott notes, \"there are several that are almost gone.\" kiribatitourism.gov.ki\nSerengeti, Tanzania\nAgricultural pressures and highway development threaten this 12,000-square-mile ecosystem that's home to the world's largest mammal migrations, with hundreds of thousands of wildebeest, zebra and gazelle crossing the region every year. \"Even something as iconic as the Serengeti Plains is under siege these days,\" Abbott says. tanzaniaparks.com\n6 CONNECT 23 TWEET 2 LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1Mkb6GI TOP VIDEOS", "external_links":
