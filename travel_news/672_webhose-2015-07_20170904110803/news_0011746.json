The move to the first direct arena gives CHS a prestigious city centre location and the extra floor space to grow the exhibition and number of visitors/buyers by 40 per cent. \nEmma Cartmell, managing director, CHS Group said: “This is a very bold move, but we are confident we can achieve this growth. The 2015 show delivered a 30 per cent increase in hosted buyers and a 20 per cent increase in both the number of exhibiting companies and floor space - and so we have now outgrown our current venue. The first direct arena is an impressive world class venue which offers us the space, the infrastructure and the city centre location to further grow and enhance our event. The central location will be an attractive proposition to buyers and the improved space and facilities will enable us to create a bigger and better event for 2016. We are also investing in enhanced marketing, promotion and PR in order to attract more visitors and buyers to the show. It’s going to be an exciting year as CHS 2016 unfolds.” Ellie Jones, business development manager, Alton Towers Resort said: “We are firm supporters of the Conference and Hospitality Show and we always achieve a great ROI. We are delighted about the move; the central location will attract busy buyers wishing to pop in for a few hours and the sheer scale and impact of the venue will enable Emma and the team to create an even more amazing event!” Keith Butler, director of sales, Marriot Hotel, Leeds said: “We have been exhibiting at the Conference and Hospitality Show for a number of years now. Alongside exhibiting, we offer bedrooms on a complimentary basis for hosted buyers, as this is a key strategy for attracting high quality conference organisers from outside of the region to the show. By being part of the hosted buyer programme the hoteliers work together to ensure that we showcase Leeds as a key conferencing destination, thus attracting more business in to the centre of Leeds. The show’s move in to a city centre location will attract more people to the show who have business to place in the city centre hotels”. Sarah Hawkins, director of sales, Radisson BLU Leeds Hotel said: “We have exhibited at the Conference and Hospitality Show since its launch in 2010 and continue to support it. It is a key part of our marketing activity for Radisson Blu Leeds due to the return on investment we receive year on year. The CHS Group team have continuously listened to both their exhibitors and visitors and developed the show each year in line with their expectations. As a loyal exhibitor I welcome the move to the first direct arena as I believe this will strengthen the show’s proposition further and attract more high quality visitors, thus increasing our return on investment.” Ben Williams, general manager, first direct arena said: \"We are delighted to be announced as the new venue for the 2016 Conference and Hospitality Show. We are confident that our state of the art facilities and city centre location will result in an event to remember.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T15:48:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
