(AP) â€” The state won't investigate the failure of a ride at a Wisconsin Dells theme park.\nEarlier this month, a large cable snapped on the Catapult ride just seconds before it was supposed to launch two people into the air at Mount Olympus Water and Theme Park.\nThe state Department of Safety and Professional Services will not investigate the failure, saying it only looks into accidents that involve injury or death. The agency was going to make sure the ride had been repaired properly, but that was scrapped once the Catapult was taken down.\nDespite several minor violations in the past, the ride did pass its most recent safety inspection in June.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T20:15:23.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
