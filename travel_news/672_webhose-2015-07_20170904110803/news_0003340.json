Taylor Swift, who was nominated for nine awards, took it personally.\nThe rapper and actor, 32, made headlines with the provocative video for her song Anaconda , which featured a lot of booty and Minaj grinding on rapper Drake’s lap.\nBut unlike Taylor Swift’s Bad Blood , Minaj’s clip was only nominated for Best Female Video - not Video of the Year.\nNicki Minaj is not impressed with MTV.

It's unlike you to pit women against each other. Maybe one of the men took your slot..\n— Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) July 21, 2015\nHuh? U must not be reading my tweets. Didn't say a word about u. I love u just as much. But u should speak on this. @taylorswift13\n— NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) July 21, 2015\nOh but trust me. I'll be on that stage to collect my awards for vid of the year. Feeling Myself & Anaconda. 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊\n— NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) July 21, 2015\nQueenBey hit me about Anaconda after the IG snippet was released saying how much she loved it. She was also VERY hands on w/FeelingMyself 😊\n— NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) July 21, 2015\nI'm not always confident. Just tired.
