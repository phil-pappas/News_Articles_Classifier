As announced at the UNESCO Committee session held in Bonn on 5 July 2015, the Speicherstadt and the neighbouring Kontorhaus district are being recognised as unique and enduring symbols of trade.\nSpeicherstadt is the world’s largest complex of uniformly designed warehouses, and this fantastic example of maritime industrial architecture is best viewed on a port boat trip. The nearby HafenCity and Elbe Philharmonic Hall are also well worth a visit.\nThe accreditation of the ‘Speicherstadt and Kontorhaus District with Chilehaus’ takes the total number of UNESCO World Heritage sites in Germany up to 40.\nSource: GNTB\nRelated Posts Global Coalition “Unite for Heritage” launched in Bonn by UNESCO TripAdvisor touches mark of 100 million downloads for free app for iPhone and Android Yemen’s Old City of Sana’a and Old Walled City of Shibam added to List of World Heritage in Danger ‘Earn While you Learn’ Programme – India Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T03:03:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
