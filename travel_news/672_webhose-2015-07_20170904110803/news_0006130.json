The last stop of the exhibit was the Plaza de la Cultura downtown, where during two weeks visitors could see and interact with 25 giant high heel shoes — 2.5 meters high, 2.5 meters long and 1.5 meters wide — decorated by 20 Costa Rican artists.\nThe pieces will be taken down Tuesday.\n“It was a great experience to contribute with public art, seeing people not so used to attending art shows stopping and taking the time to admire the pieces and taking photos,” said Juan José Durán, one of the participating artists.\nArchitect Lucía Díaz and model Leoneora Jiménez produced the event. The pieces are being auctioned off and part of the money collected will be donated to the Hogar Siembra foundation for at-risk youth.\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/URBANAStreetArt"], "published": "2015-07-14T17:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T15:59:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
