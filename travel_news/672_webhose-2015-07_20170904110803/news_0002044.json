The Safari Bus is an additional charge but may keep your car free from scratches and other damage done by overly curious or aggressive safari animals - especially the baboons. Photo © African Lion Safari Tips for Visiting Driving your own vehicle around the animal reserves is at your own risk. Baboons have been known to jump on and scratch cars, pull at antennas or remove windshield wipers. Take the Safari Bus if you are concerned about your car being damaged. If you decide to drive your own vehicle, you have the option of a monkey-free route; monkeys tend to be the biggest car hazard. The park is less busy and not so hot if you arrive for the 10 am opening. As with most theme parks, food is generally unhealthy and overpriced. Pack a picnic lunch or at the least bring a snack and a water bottle. July and August can be very hot - be prepared with water, sunscreen, hats and bring bathing suits for the kids to take advantage of the splash pad. Slightly rainy days are actually good days to visit: fewer visitors and the animals are more active than on very hot, humid days. If you want to see some of the shows (Birds of Prey, Parrot, Elephants), find out their start times before you do anything else and plan your activities around these times. One of the highlights of African Lion Safari is watching the elephants cool off with a swim. Photo © African Lion Safari What Animals Will I See? \nAnimals wandering the African Lion Safari reserves include giraffes, zebras, rhinoceroses, ostriches, lions, cheetahs, baboons and more. \nBirds of prey, including eagles, hawks, owls, vultures and falcons as well as parrots can be seen during demonstration and shows. \nGentle animals, such as baby goats can be handled and pet at the Pets' Corner.. How Are the Animals Treated? \nThere has been little reported about animal mistreatment at the African Lion Safari. Though the African Lion Safari is more acceptable - in terms of animal welfare - than many zoos and amusement parks - such as the atrocious Marineland in Niagara Falls, which has been criticized for its animal cruelty - the elephant shows, in which the elephants perform tricks, and elephant rides offered to children seem archaic and humiliating and offer no educational value for viewers. This miniature replica of an 1863 C.P. Huntington Steam engine is especially good for kids but open to all ages. Photo © African Lion Safari How Long Should I Spend at the African Lion Safari?
