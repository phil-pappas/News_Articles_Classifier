Ensuring it retains its place as one of Italy’s leading five-star hotels for the next 105 years and beyond it has continued to enhance its luxurious product offering without forsaking its celebrated heritage. The culmination of a meticulous multi-million pound renovation project is the latest incarnation of its T Spa which opens in time for the busy summer season. \nOpening its doors in 1910, Grand Hotel Tremezzo was the first property to open on the shores of Lake Como as a Grand Hotel since the very first day, playing host to the international elite who frequented the romantic grand tour circuit of the day. Always family run since its opening and cited by Greta Garbo as “that happy sunny place” in one of her most famous movies, its warm Italian hospitality, luxurious interior and sumptuous setting have firmly established it as one of Italy’s most beloved chic retreats. The latest addition to its impressive offering is the transformation of the 18th century Villa Emilia into 1,000 square metres of elegant wellness space and the introduction of Suite Emilia, an exceptional suite with private access straight into the spa. Created in association with spa specialists ESPA, T Spa comprises five-treatment rooms, a dedicated Hamman and an old Hollywood-glamour style manicure and pedicure studio. It is complemented by an infinity pool and three-storey gym. Architect Ruggero Venelli, responsible for Grand Hotel Tremezzo’s recent hip lakeside T Beach with its exclusive Pommery Champagne Bar and new ultra-luxe Rooftop Suites, has once again showcased his flair for marrying tradition with modernity. A meticulous revitalisation of all rooms to emulate the property’s sylvan and lakeside surrounds and an enlargement of the Suite Greta completes the newest offerings. With its new luxurious additions and renovations combined with exceptional epicurean offerings from Gualtiero Marchesi, unrivalled heritage and unwavering warm Italian welcome Grand Hotel Tremezzo has kick-started its next chapter with aplomb.
