I’ve loved digging around in cricketing history that is loaded with delicious characters, like a good tea table full of cakes. And of all those endearing bat- and ball-wielding eccentrics of county cricket, the most famous is WG Grace, the Gloucestershire, MCC and England player with a beard of such bounteousness and bushiness as would make the average Shoreditch hipster these days weep with envy. A superb all-rounder, Grace was also a fine tactician, but is best remembered (after that beard) for being a batsman of extraordinary skill, a wizard with the willow. In fact, Grace was from a family of exceptional cricketers. His brothers, EM and Fred, both played alongside WG in Test cricket, and his father, Dr Henry Mills Grace, can lay claim to being one of the founders of the Gloucestershire Cricket Club. Grace senior founded the Mangotsfield club in 1845, which merged with West Gloucestershire in 1846 and finally became Gloucestershire in 1867, playing its first county game in 1870. The world’s first modern chocolate bar was produced by Fry’s in Bristol in 1842, six years before WG Grace’s birth Gloucestershire’s home ground is in Bristol, a city with a long history as a great port, dealing (shamefully) with slaves – but also with spices, sugar and chocolate. Cacao beans brought into Bristol harbour allowed Joseph Fry to open his chocolate factory in Bristol in 1777, at a time when cricket was already well established in the area as a parish game. The Sugar House, where sugar from the Caribbean was processed, still stands near the harbourside, not far from the Fry factory on Union Street. The world’s first modern chocolate bar was produced by Fry’s in Bristol in 1842, six years before WG’s birth. I wonder if Dr Henry Mills Grace and his brother-in-law Alfred Pocock indulged in a bar or two while they planned their new cricket club. So, something for a Gloucestershire cricket tea. Here’s a cake showcasing some of Bristol’s finest imports. A rich dark gingerbread, full of spice and chocolate, it’s one that would grace any cricket tea table. Chocolate gingerbread cake recipe For the cake 200g (7oz) self-raising flour, sieved 1oz (30g) cocoa powder 1tsp bicarbonate of soda 1tbsp ground ginger 1tsp ground cinnamon ½tsp cayenne pepper 115g (4oz) butter 115g (4oz) caster sugar 225g (8oz) black treacle (or half treacle, half golden syrup, for a lighter cake) 2tbsp grated root ginger 250ml (9fl oz) milk 100g (3½oz) plain chocolate, chopped 1 egg For the filling 150g (5oz) white chocolate 150ml (5fl oz) double cream To decorate 60g/2oz each of white and plain chocolate, melted 3tbsp chopped crystallised ginger Preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Grease and line a 20cm/8in round cake tin. Stir together the flour, cocoa powder, bicarbonate of soda, ground ginger, cinnamon and cayenne pepper in a mixing bowl. Heat the butter with the sugar, treacle (or treacle and golden syrup), grated root ginger and milk over a gentle heat, until the sugar has dissolved. Cool until tepid, then stir in the chocolate and the egg. Pour the butter/sugar/egg mix into the flour bowl and mix well. Scrape the mixture into the tin and bake for between 50 minutes and an hour. Leave to cool in the tin before turning out. For the filling, break the white chocolate into small pieces and put in a bowl. Heat the cream to just below boiling and pour over the chocolate. Stir until the chocolate is melted, then leave to cool in the fridge. Use to fill the cake. Decorate with melted white and plain chocolate, plus chopped crystallised ginger.
