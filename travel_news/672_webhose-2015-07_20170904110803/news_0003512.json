Under the pension freedoms introduced by George Osborne in April, the over-55s can leave their money in the stock market indefinitely and make unlimited withdrawals. But those taking this option - as opposed to cashing in the whole pot or buying an annuity - face a \"bewildering array\" of fees that vary significantly between providers, research found. Consumer group Which? said older savers were paying thousands of pounds over the odds without any idea they were being ripped off. Its warnings come as the Treasury prepares an inquiry into the barriers stopping people using the new flexible retirement rules - a direct response to a Telegraph campaign for action . However, it is understood that civil servants will disregard the \"lottery\" on charges for bank account-style withdrawals as they begin work in the coming weeks. Frank Field, chairman of the Work and Pensions select committee, called said it was vital that savers were protected from the \"madly complex\" retirement market. \"It seems almost impossible for pensioners to know whether or not they have been ripped off, such are the complications involved in all of this,\" he said. \"People have been asked to navigate this hazardous landscape with no map or compass.\" Savers who use their pensions like bank accounts are losing as much as £10,000 The committee is now conducting its own investigations and will question ministers and insurance executives this autumn. The study by Which? compared the charges at 18 different companies for someone with a £250,000 pot. The customer was presumed to withdraw 6 per cent a year, with the investments growing at 5 per cent. Costs varied by as much as £10,165 over the course of a decade, with customers at LV= foregoing £16,325 compared to £26,490 at Scottish Widows. Experts warned that without a cap on excessive fees tens of thousands of people who retired each year would be shortchanged unnecessarily. David Harrison, a partner in one of Britain’s biggest financial advice firms, True Potential, said: \"Annual charges on pensions are a minefield that no consumer has any realistic chance of navigating and they have been overlooked by the regulator for far too long. \"Consumers are almost certain to end up being ripped off at some point and asking an adviser to analyse countless products and work out if a client will be better in ten years’ time just lands the consumer with a hefty bill. \"The financial regulator and the Government should act on fast by introducing a cap.\" Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?, said: \"While it's good that the Government is looking at making it easier for people to move pension companies [to get a good deal] , it should also consider a cap on charges for drawdown products sold by existing providers.\" Yvonne Braun, director of long-term savings policy at the Association of British Insurers trade body, said: “This is a competitive sector and the market continues to develop in response to consumer demand. \"It is always very important to shop around for the best deal.\" dan.hyde@telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph The Telegraph Investor Open a SIPP and take control of your pension Find out more »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T15:13:49.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
