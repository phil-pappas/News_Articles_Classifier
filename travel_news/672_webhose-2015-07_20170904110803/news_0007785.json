Trasimeno is Italy's largest non-Alpine lake and is fairly shallow. The lake was the site of a famous battle between Hannibal and Rome. There are several interesting, historical towns around the lake and the large island, Isola Maggiore, famous for its lace-making is a good place to visit. One of the prettiest towns is Castiglione del Lago with a medieval center and castle by the lake. There are beaches around the lake. Lake Orta \nThe small lake of Orta is west of Lake Maggiore in the northern Italian lakes district. In the past Lake Orta was a popular retreat for poets and artists. From the charming village of Orta San Giulio you can visit the one island in the lake or climb Sacro Monte, or the sacred mountain, where there's a sanctuary built in 1591 and small chapels dedicated to Saint Francis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T03:02:31.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
