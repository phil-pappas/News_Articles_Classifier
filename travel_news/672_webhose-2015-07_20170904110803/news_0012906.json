In order to refinance we found we had to pay the swaps off. I think we’re going to get this money back.”\nThe exceptional resulted in Firmdale recording a £35.3 million pre-tax loss for the 12 months to the end of January 2015, while turnover rose to a record £99.6 million, boosted by the opening of the Ham Yard Hotel in June 2014.\nFirmdale has eight sites in London and one in New York, with a second Manhattan hotel due to open next year. Kemp said he was negotiating on two more sites and hopes to reach agreement on the London site by September.\nResponding to speculation about a stock market flotation for the company, Kemp said that “nothing’s out of the question. I’m approached pretty well all the time by sovereign funds and people”. He estimated the business, which has net assets of £388.6 million, was worth between £500 million and £600 million.\nA spokesman for Barclays said it will be “vigorously” defending the Firmdale case. Banks have paid out £1.8 billion through a redress scheme to around 11,000 businesses who suffered losses after being mis-sold complex hedging products.\nSource:-Boutique Hotel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:48:40.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
