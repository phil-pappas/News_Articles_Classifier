Construction along Houston's Allen Parkway will begin Aug. 3. The city will break ground on the busy road west of downtown, adding a U-turn bridge at Waugh Drive, new stoplights and crosswalks at Gillette, Taft and Dunlavy streets, KHOU reported . The $11 million project will also create 175 new parking spaces in the current westbound lanes between Montrose and I-45. Once completed, speed limits will also be reduced. The changes are being made in attempt to make the parkway safer for drivers and pedestrians alike. However, delays are to be expected. The first crews will begin work at Dunlavy and D'Amico streets. Closures are expected at Gillette street as well. Officials said they will not close more than one lane of traffic at a time. Houston commuters along Interstate 45 North, U.S. Highway 290 and U.S. 59 South should also expect to face more traffic in the coming weeks . Beginning Aug. 3, no single-occupancy vehicles will be allowed to use HOV lanes on these roads from 4:30 to 6 p.m. Currently, this limit exists from 5 to 6 p.m. The Allen Parkway project is scheduled to be completed by May 2016. The project is being funded by the Downtown Redevelopment Authority. \nWant Houston Travel news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
