PUBLISHED: 17:58, Sun, Jul 5, 2015 | UPDATED: 18:14, Sun, Jul 5, 2015 NC DISTINCTIVE: Lounge with a conservatory-style ceiling painted with exotic birds \nAlthough the company refuses to reveal how much money will be spent, UK and Ireland Managing Director Richard Twynam has admitted it will be a enormous amount to create a much lighter and contemporary feel to the ships. \nBuilt in 2000 for the now-defunct Renaissance Cruises, Quest and Journey will have new carpets, curtains and soft furnishings throughout in creams, coffee brown and soft beiges, with their dark wood panelling lightened. \nTwo new spa suites will be built on both ships, with a private corridor connecting them to the spa and neighbouring gym. \nThese will be fitted in what is presently the Acupuncture Room and Connections – the internet room – because “we are putting in WiFi everywhere”. \nThe Spa, to be renamed Sanctum and completely rebuilt in marble, light wood and a cream decor, may still offer acupuncture, along with other medi-spa treatments such as botox and teeth whitening. NC LUXURY: The open deck at the back of the spa has loungers and a thalassotherapy whirlpool Passengers will be able to book a large cabana for a private dinner and sleep under the stars package \nPassengers who pay to use the open deck at the back of the spa, which has luxury loungers and a thalassotherapy whirlpool, will also be able to book a large cabana for a private dinner and sleep under the stars package. \nEvery suite and stateroom will have new beds, as well as the cream and soft brown décor, and the large mirrors opposite every bed will be removed because “it’s bad feng shui”. \nAll the restaurants will be modernised and some new eating options introduced, such as a free tapas bar in the Looking Glass. \nThis observation lounge and bar has dancing at night “although we’re not really about night clubbing” said Twynam, who added: “This is a space that is going to change dramatically.” \nThe Windows Café buffet restaurant has an outdoor area at the back of the ship which is one of the most popular places to eat, but although it will still be part of the free buffet restaurant for breakfast and lunch, in the evening it will become an Asian/fusion restaurant with a $25 cover charge. \nThe distinctive Drawing Room, a library and lounge with a conservatory-style ceiling painted with exotic birds – similar to other ex-Renaissance ships now part of Oceania Cruises and P&O Cruises – will also lose its dark wood panelling.
