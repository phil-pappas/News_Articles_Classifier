The conference is aiming to achieve the first legally binding climate change agreement in 20 years. \nWTM senior director Simon Press said: “At WRTD we have been promoting the business case behind responsible tourism for many years now and we know there are many great examples of best practice within the industry. \n“By pooling our knowledge in this report we can not only help people attending the day’s event but also, hopefully, the entire industry.” \nThe afternoon sees a debate on whether the industry can reduce its carbon emissions. \nTo get involved with the white paper, email WTM responsible tourism consultant Professor Harold Godwin at harold@haroldgoodwin.info with examples of carbon reduction case studies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T13:11:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
