Take 2-3 tsp of coconut oil, a pinch of mushka kapur, 1/2 tsp of lemon and 1/2 tsp of organic aloe vera juice. Mix it well till it becomes a thin solution. Apply it on the scalp, keep it for half an hour and rinse it with an organic shampoo. \n5. Rain water tends to spoil the quality of hair and makes it limp. However, if you get wet in rain, rinse your hair with plenty of clean water and a mild shampoo as soon as you can. This will prevent germ infection on the scalp and checks hair fall. \nWith inputs by Dr Anjali Chawla, Skin and Hair Specialist Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T14:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T20:29:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
