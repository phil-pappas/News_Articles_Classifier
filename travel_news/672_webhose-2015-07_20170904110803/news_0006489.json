We handled this period like the high season and reinforced our services to ensure that passengers were served as quickly and efficiently as possible, thereby facilitating and expediting the check-in and boarding process,” said Pablo Yunis, VP of Sales at LAN in Chile.\n“Our passengers can access our free mobile app that simplifies the travel process by allowing them to check-in, select seats, save boarding passes without the need to print them out, check flight statuses and maintain a record of flights using their Smartphone,” he added.\nThe Company also implemented new technology on its LAN and TAM websites that allows passengers to access more information and causes regarding flight status in the case of a contingency. Using this technology, passengers may access the following information: flight status – on time, delayed, cancelled; reason for the contingency; passenger alternatives for travel; deployment of basic services; and a ‘Live Chat’ to answer their questions.\nSource:- Lan\nRelated Posts MIA Director, National Counterparts Travel To Washington, D.c.
