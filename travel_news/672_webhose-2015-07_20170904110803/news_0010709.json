Founder Raquel Davidowicz has been the brand’s creative director since the beginning, though the label’s style has evolved as Davidowicz’s mind-set and personal tastes have changed.\nThe people Davidowicz connects with are the ones who influence the label—for example, artists Regina Silveira and Mana Bernardes are personal friends who have inspired Davidowicz over the years. Each collection is based on one vision that is part of the designer’s personal universe. Uma’s Fall 2014 collection, which was presented at São Paulo fashion week, was inspired by the São Paulo Dance Company, and the show was an unexpected dance spectacle that was the talk of the town throughout the entire fashion season.\nUma’s clientele is mostly women in the art world. “Our customers have an open mind and a life focused on individuality,” said Davidowicz. She explained that the idea of “modernity as a behavior and individuality has been growing in Brazil.”\nDavidowicz ’ s aesthetic is akin to that of a Brazilian Rick Owens . She captures the essence of the now inside her own world, creating one-of-a-kind styles mostly in monochrome. “The brand is timeless. It’s asexual. Men are starting to buy womenswear,” said Davidowicz. “My clients are not really worried if they look weird. It’s a pleasure to dress with personality, and few people in Brazil are doing this, but I have always done it.”", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php"], "published": "2015-07-07T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T00:39:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
