Denmark followed suit but Germany and France have not altered their advice. \n'Emerging threat' \nBetween 2,500 and 3,000 British package holidaymakers are believed to be in Tunisia, as well as about 500 independent travellers. \nThe Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) said its members were aiming to bring customers home in the next 48 hours. \nThe first British tourists arrived at Manchester Airport shortly after 13:00 BST. \nThe UK government had stressed there was no new \"specific or imminent\" threat, but intelligence had led officials to the view that a further attack was \"highly likely\". \nMr Hammond said the government had been careful not to act in a \"knee-jerk manner\". \n\"We now have a much better picture of the emerging scale of the threat as well as a much better understanding of the mitigations the Tunisians have put in place,\" he said. \nMr Hammond said Tunisian authorities were continuing to hunt individuals suspected of having links to the Sousse attack and an attack in March on the Bardo Museum near Tunis, which left 22 dead, including one Briton. \nBBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said counter-terror experts, along with Tunisian authorities, had concluded \"that the country faces a very serious threat from an only partially-dismantled terror cell\". \nHe said this means Seifeddine Rezgui had accomplices were still \"at large\" and they \"have probably got access to automatic weapons\" and \"could quite possibly be looking for new Western targets\". \nThe UK warning comes as the funeral of two victims of the attack - Jim and Anne McQuire, from Cumbernauld - took place in their home town. \nThe Tunisian prime minister said the country had done \"everything we can to protect (British) citizens and their interests, as well as those of all other countries\". \nHabib Essid said the government would help people leave, but he planned to speak to his British counterpart David Cameron about the change in travel advice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T21:37:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
