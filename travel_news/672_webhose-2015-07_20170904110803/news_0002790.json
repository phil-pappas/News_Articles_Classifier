She says the 1st Amendment to the U.S. Constitution gives her the right to not issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples because it violates her religious beliefs.\nAttorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union say Davis’ rationale would mean local officials could also deny marriage licenses to people who have been divorced or committed other actions that some consider sinful.\nU.S. District Judge David Bunning says he will decide the case by the middle of August.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
