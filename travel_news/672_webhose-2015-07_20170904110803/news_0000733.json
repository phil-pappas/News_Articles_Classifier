If you are stopping at Duke's Travel Plaza, then along with all the other offers of the location (including a Knife Shop, Gas Station, Food, Gifts, and More) you can let your dog run. This is a new offering at the location and intends to help out people on the road who are concerned with providing the ample amount of activity for their dogs.\nDogs often are like young children, and if they aren't given something constructive to do with their energy, such as exercise, they can become restless and release their energy in ways that may not be optimal in the confines of a car. Luckily Dukes Travel Plaza has a solution to this. When you stop in to buy gas, food, or gifts, the dog can exercise, providing you with a more comfortable remainder of your trip, and the guarantee that your family member got much needed time outdoors.\nAbout Duke's Travel Plaza:\nDuke's Travel Plaza is a truck stop and shopping center.
