We had dogs when I was a child, and after I married we adopted Lou – a two-year-old yellow Labrador who became the canine love of my life – and then two yellow Lab sisters, Grace and Favour. • Can cats be bipolar? Our two daughters grew up with these three – learning to walk by holding on to Lou, who took a proprietorial interest in each of the youngsters as both girls and dogs grew into their teens. But there were cats as well. Hector and Spud were given to me on my 48th birthday. If you saw BBC Gardeners' World during my seven-year tenure you may remember them. One snoring cat against the pesky mice (Baxter George/Maidstone Museum) They invariably chose to make an appearance when filming was in progress, strutting through the shot looking for all the world as though they were ready for their close-ups. Hector was white and gingery-buff and Spud was black with white markings. Hector was named after my first parks superintendent boss, and Spud was named… after a potato. Whenever I would bend over and plant things for the camera, it was Spud who would jump on my back to get a closer look at what was going on. • Are dogs the new cats? • Dog owner puts his pet on the payroll Hector, alas, died at the age of eight from a brain haemorrhage, but Spud battled on alone, bewildered at first by his lack of a brother, but eventually realising that he no longer had to wait until Hector had eaten before he could approach the bowl, and that now he was a free agent. Thanks, in part, to the fact that he was brought up with dogs and that his brother had died relatively early in his life, I suspect that Spud felt more affinity with dogs than with cats. He never once scratched anyone, and never once applied his teeth to anything except the meat and biscuits in his bowl. Oh, apart from the odd rodent. Ginger cat sits and watches in the garden (Alamy) He was once seen trying to drag a baby rabbit through a gap in the stock fencing before working out the best way to get it through a cat flap. But with age the hunting grew less frequent, and Spud liked nothing more than to curl up in the sun on the garden path, his white moustache twitching as he dreamt of times gone by. Each morning he would come in from the potting shed where he slept to eat his breakfast. He uttered a brief “good morning” as he came through the back door (he really did), and then, when the meal was over, would come over and insist – vocally – that I rub his back hard for a good two minutes before he would go and sleep on a favourite chair. • Pet subjects: is my cat high? • Pet tales: Harry the cat Doors were left open so that he could come and go and then, in the evening, he would lie on the sofa in the crook of my right arm, which stretched right up his body between his back and his front legs so that my hand could stroke his chin. He was, above all else, companionable. He was still a cat, still had his own opinions, likes and dislikes, but even when the grandchildren came along, rather than be unpleasant to them he would simply absent himself swiftly and silently, coming back indoors when he thought the coast was clear. One cat enjoying cuddles (Alamy) Two months ago he went blind. Blood pressure, the vet said. Then, last weekend, we found him half-paralysed outside the potting shed. The end had come. He was 18 and a half. We laid him to rest under a statue of Peter Pan enveloped in catmint and marguerites. I have shed tears for several dogs in my lifetime. I never expected to shed them in quite the same way for a cat. The house is quiet and one of my best mates is no more. Goodbye Spud. And thanks for everything.
