Now Gucci has gotten in the restaurant game—though you’ll have to travel around the world to eat there. Gucci’s premiere bistro, called 1921 Gucci Café, is located within the brand’s Shanghai boutique and offers a full-service menu, which differs from that of the café affixed to the Gucci Museo in Florence. [ The Daily Meal ]\nManolo expands…\nIf you love your BB pumps and Hangisi flats , we have some good news: Manolo Blahnik is launching a handbag collection. Inspired by his signature shoe silhouettes, the line of clutches comes in vibrant colors with jewel embellishments. So is this the first step in a bigger expansion? “At the moment I have no plans to make other accessories,” said Blahnik. [ British Vogue ]\nA new CEO at Kering…\nFollowing CEO of luxury couture and leather goods Marco Bizzarri’s appointment to CEO of Gucci earlier this year, Kering has finally chosen a replacement of sorts. Former Unilever executive Grita Loebsack was named CEO of its luxury couture and leather goods emerging brands—that’s Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga, Brioni, Christopher Kane, Stella McCartney, and Tomas Maier—while François-Henri Pinault will continue as CEO of luxury couture and leather goods at Gucci, Bottega Veneta, and Saint Laurent. [ WWD ]\nDior returns home…\nWhere does one wear one of Raf Simons’ Fall 2015 fur dresses for Dior? In Christian Dior’s hometown of Granville, France, of course. The brand’s latest campaign finds Mica Arganaraz, Natalie Westling, and Julia Nobis in Simons’ mod pieces, reclining cliffside in the seaside village. [ Dior ]\nKeeping up with the Clevelands…\nMother-daughter model pairs seem to be all the rage these days—see the Spring ’15 Lanvin campaign—and no duo is more notable than Pat and Anna Cleveland. The two sat down to talk about the 1960s, beauty ideals, and “couture university” in a new interview. [ Dazed ]\nPsst…did you hear?
