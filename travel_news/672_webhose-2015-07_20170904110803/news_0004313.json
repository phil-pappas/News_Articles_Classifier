She has frozen new licences for tourist lodgings. \nLike the online car-hailing service Uber, Airbnb has provoked complaints of unfair competition. European Union authorities are preparing new regulations for such services. \nAirbnb has agreed to similar tariffs in cities including Amsterdam, Washington DC and Chicago. ­— AFP-Relaxnews More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T19:43:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
