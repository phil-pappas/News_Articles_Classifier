Founders Darrell Wade (left) and Geoff “Manch” Manchester (right) with group managing director James Thornton \nBut not the founders of adventure travel firm Intrepid Travel, Darrell Wade and Geoff (“Manch”) Manchester, who say many adventures lie ahead for them in the “new” Intrepid Group. \nThis comes after Tui Group and the two founders of Intrepid Travel announced they were walking away from their PEAK Adventure Travel Group strategic agreement. \nSpeaking to Wade, Intrepid Group chief executive; Manchester, non-executive director and chairman of the Intrepid Foundation; and group managing director James Thornton, it quickly becomes clear that the team is thrilled to have their “baby” back and are now eyeing major growth in the UK and US. \n“I see the future as being super bright. That is why I wanted to ‘buy’ back the company and Manch felt the same. We could always sell our shares or get out of the company - to be frank, we don’t need to work any more - but it’s really good fun,” says Wade. \nAmicable split PEAK Adventure Travel Group was formed in 2011 with Tui holding 60% and the Intrepid founders 40%. At the time, Tui said the strategic venture was forecast to drive economies of scale of at least £10 million per year within the first three years. \nHowever, four years on, the two parties agreed to part ways, in no small way owing to “different priorities and business philosophies”. \nWade confirms that discussions have been ongoing for more than a year and describes the split as “amicable”. He believes the move will allow Intrepid Group to focus on its core values of purpose before profit, while also reinjecting more entrepreneurial flair into the business. \n“Manch and I love to make a profit, of course, but we do see it as the output of activities, rather than the thing we get up in the morning for,” says Wade. “Tui is a publicly listed company so they naturally - and rightly - have a shorter-term financial responsibility to their shareholders.” \nThe Intrepid Foundation charity, of which Manchester is chairman, will become a “significantly more important plank of the business”. \nPhilosophical differences Manchester is also quick to point out the benefits that resulted from the PEAK venture. \n“A benefit of working with a publicly listed company has been around governance. We have had to improve our systems and we benefited a lot from that. We will be taking that forward in certain areas,” he says. \nAnd Intrepid Group and Tui will also remain partners in some areas, particularly in respect to both of their destination management companies (DMCs). “We’ve worked hard to establish that, so neither side wanted to throw that away,” says Wade. \nWhile ties with Tui will remain, both founders are looking forward to running more freely with entrepreneurial ideas. \n“If you really want to grow, you need to go into new things and they won’t always work. I look forward to playing more with that - I am not sure if James is thrilled with that, though, as he has responsibility for the financials for the business!” Wade jokes. \nInvestments in the UK A move that none of the three considers a risk is major investments in the UK and US over the next five years. \n“Just under 50% of our business comes from Australia and New Zealand. According to the Adventure Travel Trade Association, this is only about 6% of the global US$260 billion market. Our opportunity for growth into the UK, US and Europe is huge,” says Thornton. \nHe says the group intends to drive much of that growth, particularly in the UK, through agents. “The majority of our sales today still come through travel agents - we see the future continuing to be that way,” he says. \nWith two of the world’s biggest - and most competitive - travel markets to conquer, it is unlikely that Wade and Manchester will be sipping beachside cocktails any time soon - but that’s just the way these two independent spirits would have it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T12:12:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
