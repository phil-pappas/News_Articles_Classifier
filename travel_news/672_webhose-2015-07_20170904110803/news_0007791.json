BLAYNE SLABBERT Last updated 16:24, July 29 2015 Blayne Slabbert/Fairfax NZ \nPerisher has plenty of great terrain, especially if you are a beginner or intermediate. \nI've been to most skifields in New Zealand, enjoying everything from the great terrain and facilities at Cardrona to the quaintness of Mt Cheeseman. \nI'd met a lot of Australians at those fields and I always wondered why they flew all the way over here when they've got famous resorts like Perisher and Thredbo back home. \nThis month I skied in Australia for the first time, spending a few bluebird days at Perisher. So, how does it compare to New Zealand? \nSIZE \nPerisher has seven peaks and 47 lifts ( Whakapapa has 11 , the most in New Zealand) as well as multiple bars and restaurants. \nIt's so big there's a train to take you to other parts of the mountain. It'd probably take the average skier at least a few days to ski the whole resort. The chance to explore is a real treat, especially compared to New Zealand fields where you have to ski the same runs repeatedly. \nPerisher has about 1250 hectares of skiable terrain, more than twice than Treble Cone, our biggest resort. \nACCESS \nIt's nice to go skiing without a nail-biting trip up a gravel road. It's easy to see why Australians are so scared of our access roads after being at Perisher which is right next to a main road. \nTo get between peaks you can take the train or bus. That's something we don't have here. However, there is a real sense of adventure when you drive up to some of our fields. I reckon the best here is Rainbow, which has a lovely tree-lined road. \nTREES \nSkiing through trees is great fun and they have the added bonus of holding powder stashes. \nI don't think we have a single tree on any ski run in New Zealand. At Perisher they are everywhere, lining the runs and offering lots of potential for exploring. \nCROWDS \nWhen I skied Perisher it was very busy, but the whole mountain wasn't open so the crowds were concentrated on the main runs. They did have an eight-seat chairlift, something we don't have in New Zealand, which helped reduce the wait time. \nIt's probably not much more crowded than our big resorts, but you can escape the crowds here by going to a smaller commercial resort or a club field. \nI've been to skifields in New Zealand and been among only a handful of people here. Our club fields may be rustic, but they're a real treasure as the basic facilities seem to keep the crowds down. \nCOST \nThe cost of Perisher's lift tickets was a lot higher than our big commercial fields - AU$122 (NZ$135) compared to about $100 here. However you are getting much more terrain for your money. \nTheir private lessons are very expensive, AU$300 for a two-hour session. At Mt Hutt, you pay $100 an hour. \nAPRES SKI \nI didn't spend too much time out on the town, but according to hotels.com, Queenstown has 130 bars and restaurants within 1 sq km, compared to 30 in Jindabyne. I think that pretty much sums it up. \nSTEEPNESS \nThis is where things start getting unstuck for Australian ski fields. If you wanted to be harsh, their mountains are only really big hills. \nBut they are fun and Perisher would be a great place to learn and progress as an intermediate. However, if you want to go steep, then New Zealand resorts have it in bucket loads. The black run at Roundhill has Australasia's biggest vertical drop (783m). \nSNOW \nThis is what really counts. When I skied at Perisher in early July there was only man-made snow on the mountain. At the same time, Mt Hutt had received about 1.5m. \nPerisher has more than 200 ski guns that pumped out enough snow to have about 20 lifts and a terrain park open. Pretty impressive. \nIn the past weeks, there have been several dumps in Australia and they do have some good snow years. \nVERDICT \nSo is it worth Kiwis travelling to Australia to ski? If you want it steep and deep, then no. Stay here and enjoy our wide range of ski fields and hope we have as much snow as we do this season. \nHowever, if you like exploring and are sick of going down the same runs year after year it's worth a look. But I wouldn't go early in the season. Try and wait for a good dump of snow and be prepared to get lost on the dozens of tree-lined runs. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T07:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T10:20:28.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
