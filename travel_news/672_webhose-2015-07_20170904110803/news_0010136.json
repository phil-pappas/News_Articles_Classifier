SO hectic.\nAs soon as you’re live to air or live on the internet, you might as well stick any planning you’ve done in the bin, because you have to be ready for anything and everything to change.\nWhen I was handed the briefing notes for the Magic Mike XXL premiere LIVE red carpet event in Sydney, I saw a show full of dance performances, interviews with stars on the carpet (and the odd over excited fan) and a five minute chat to Channing Tatum and Joe Manganiello (yeah right).\nLet’s be real here people, in my mind I thought I’d be lucky to score a one minute chat maximum with both of the stars before they’d be rushed off by security into an elaborate VIP fancy pants dressing room backstage.\nHowever, this time around, it was like I had ALL the time in the world with the two VERY charming gentlemen.\nChanning Tatum and Joe Manganiello (both playful and fun), were doing some robot dance moves behind me as I addressed the camera to welcome everyone back to the Magic Mike XXL premiere at Qantas Credit Union Arena.\nI encouraged the crowd to cheer for me to turn around to see who I could talk to next, and there they were, towering over me!\nI opened with, “everyone here is frothing about Magic Mike XXL ”.\nChanning Tatum LOL’d. He actually bent over laughing. So I think my first impression was a good one.\nLook behind you Maz, it’s two Hollywood hunks! Source: Supplied\nAfter making him and Joe repeat some borderline offensive Australian lingo and having a really good chat about their movie screening, I marched them off to see their fans.\nThe next run-in was at the backstage briefing.\nThere were a lot of people in this briefing and I had to wait outside of the room around the corner, like a naughty kid who had been kicked out of class.\nEventually someone told someone else and that someone said it was finally OK for me to enter the room.\nWhen I did, it was awkward because for a second the entire briefing paused and everyone looked at me,\nI was like, “hey dudes”.\nIt took at lot of chatter between security and PR people on comms devices to communicate that I would welcome the guys onto the stage, and then they would introduce the movie.\nWith the plan in place, Channing turned to me and said, “You got me on the red carpet. I lost it when you said ‘frothing’. You just came out with like three great lines all at once, very funny.”\nIn my head, all I could think was, CHANNING TATUM CHANNING TATUM CHANNING TATUM.\nBut I managed to act relatively normal and replied, “Oh thanks, it was super fun.”\nHe asked me if my name, Maz, was short for something and I answered honestly by saying, “No, not really,” and then I immediately thought that I should have lied and made up a cooler answer like, “Yeah it was the name that Oprah gave me when she christened me”.\nBut the moment had passed.\nWe were all ushered to the side of the stage with security and torches. I felt like I was in Homeland (but with less killing and more high heels).\nWhile our Aussie MMXXL inspired dancers went nuts up on the stage, Channing stood to the side and watched.\nThe Aussie MMXXL dancers. Yes please! Source: Supplied\nAs he watched them intently, I watched HIM intently (which on reflection was a bit creepy, but hey, I’m only human).\nHe was so into the dancing. He was really encouraging towards the guys and couldn’t help busting out some subtle moves himself. He really does like doing the robot, a lot!\nThe it was my turn so I welcomed the movie’s writer and producer, director and stars to the stage (after a slight microphone fail), so that they could introduce the film.\nBut Channing had totally missed me calling his name, so he just stood there, on the side.\nEventually he looked at me with a confused expression along the lines of, “oh hey, did you call me up already?”\nI pointed behind my shoulder and told him to “get up there!” and as he passed me we high fived (Don’t worry, I looked at his elbow to make sure that I didn’t screw it up).\nThe Q&A after the movie screening was by far my favourite part of the night: One on one time with our four famous guests, just metres away from of an audience of 5000 people.\nWhat a moment. Well, what a half-hour!\nThe guys were really generous with their answers ... and their laughs.\nChanning lost it when I whispered into the microphone to one of the male dancers that I would be in dressing room eight (in case he wanted to visit later on).\nI think Channing really appreciated the fun banter and the chilled out vibe here in Sydney, and for the most part had a grin from ear to ear.\nJoe shared a photo from the night on Instagram. Source: Instagram\nWhen I thanked the lads for their time, they got up, arms over shoulders and walked to the front of the stage so that the fans could have one last glimpse of the superstars.\nChanning Tatum looked at me and he motioned for me to join them. I stayed where I was (because I’m a professional).\nJOKES!\nI was next to Channing within a second, lapping up the love and taking it all in.\nHe chucked an arm around me and we all just stood there in front of the adoring crowd.\nIn my mind, again all I was thinking was, “CHANNING TATUM CHANNING TATUM CHANNING TATUM”.\nWith his muscle-laden arm around me, I said, “Um, I’ve been asked to keep both hands of my hands out front and in sight”.\nWithout missing a beat, he said, “Well I haven’t”.\nI then got a kiss on the cheek from the one of the sweetest men I’ve ever had the pleasure of interviewing.\nMaz Compton is co-host of the Dan and Maz show 2Day Hit 104.1 FM in Sydney.\nOriginally published as ‘Everyone here is frothing’", "external_links": ["http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227435/064478-8f4c1e84-25cf-11e5-b2b1-af71b9aa897c.jpg", "http://www.2dayfm.com.au/shows/the-dan-maz-show/", "http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/maz-compton-reveals-what-channing-tatums-really-like/story-e6frfmw0-1227435064597", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227435/064182-904fdf46-25cf-11e5-b2b1-af71b9aa897c.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227435/064564-bcb8e206-25d6-11e5-b2b1-af71b9aa897c.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/1yYpXcQ3eIU"], "published": "2015-07-09T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T06:34:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
