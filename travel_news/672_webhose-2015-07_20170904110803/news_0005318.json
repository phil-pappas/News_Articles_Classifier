See my post on how the airlines handle passengers of size.\nWhen asked, “If the person in the airline seat in front of you reclined their seat so much that you were unable to lower your tray table or unable to open up a laptop, what would you do?” the responses were: 37.9 percent would say something directly to the person; 38.7 percent would call a flight attendant to handle the situation; 13.1 percent would sit quietly and say nothing.\nLearn more about airline seat pitch in my post here.\nWhen asked, “If someone gave you a ‘knee defender’ (a newer device created so the person in the airplane seat in front of you won’t be able to recline), would you ever use it?” the responses were: only 0.7 percent said absolutely-in fact I have used one; 14.9 percent said they would absolutely use it; 11.5 percent said they’d think about using it, but chicken out; 52.6 percent said they wouldn’t use it because everyone should have the option to recline their seat; and 20.3 percent said they didn’t know.\nFinally, when asked, “If you were on a plane and realized the person behind you used the “knee defender” on your airplane seat so that you couldn’t recline, what would you do?” the responses were: 15.3 percent would say something directly to the person; 43.7 percent would have a flight attendant handle the situation; 25 percent would sit quietly and say nothing; and 15.9 percent were not sure. The Federal Aviation Administration says the knee defender does not violate its regulations, unless an individual uses the device against the express instructions of the flight crew.\n“With shrinking airline seat space and planes flying at full capacity, it’s not surprising over 76 percent of those polled would take some sort of action if the person in front of them reclined their seat all the way back. Yet 52.6 percent of respondents said they would not use the ‘knee defender’ given the opportunity,” stated Barry Liben, CEO of Travel Leaders Group.\n“We encourage travelers take action, particularly in situations where tourists are demonstrating poor behavior by damaging major artifacts or skirting rules and regulations,” said Liben. “Travelers should know they can always go to official personnel – be it security guards or flight attendants – if they don’t want to confront someone directly.”\n ", "external_links": ["http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/W/Q/K/182736769.jpg", "http://www.travelleadersgroup.com/", "http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/agc/pol_adjudication/agc200/Interpretations/data/interps/2014/Jimenez%20-%20%282014%29%20Legal%20Interpretation.pdf", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/Q/K/182736769.jpg", "http://www.kneedefender.com/"], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T20:12:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
