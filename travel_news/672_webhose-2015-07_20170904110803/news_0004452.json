As the King of Alcatraz appears before us, in his full regalia, a spontaneous cheer erupts from the small but enthusiastic crowd: his highness resembles a cross between Andy Pandy, a court jester and a wizard. The King of Alcatraz resembles Andy Pandy Photo: TOM COOTE Many of these dignitaries, having chosen to honour us with their presence, have travelled from far and wide to represent their own tiny self-declared states at the 3rd International Conference on Micronations. What started out for many as an art statement, a political protest, or simply a hobby, has grown into a global phenomenon throughout a world in which many feel increasingly disenchanted with the dream of the nation state. As the seemingly powerless appropriate the iconography of ruling elites, they successfully parody many of our assumptions regarding class, identity and economics power. They also look like they're having a laugh. • 10 bizarre micronations It is no coincidence that a number of Micronations have emerged from what are effectively artists colonies - Uzupis, Christiana and Ladonia, to name but three – as small but focussed collectives of artists, poets, and musicians, seem to foster the outsider mentality, and intellectual playfulness, required for such irreverence. Alcatraz, the host of this year's micronations conference, is also something akin to an artistic state: a 50 Euro taxi ride from the nearest public transport, in Perugia, this micronation really does exist in a world of its own, where artistic expression, the joys of slow food, and protection of the local environment, are enshrined in its constitution. The Republic of Molossia was conceived by Kevin Baugh in 1977, as part of a school project Photo: REX FEATURES But not all micronations have such lofty concerns. Others have formed following disputes with with local authorities, to avoid paying national taxes, to make some easy cash from selling meaningless titles to gullible foreigners, or simply to gain attention. Others vociferously object to the idea of belonging to a state simply because they happened to be born within a certain territory: the one-man micronation, formerly known as Benny Andre Lund, changed his name by deed poll to 'The Republic of Benny'. When I looked a little sceptical he showed me the name in his Norwegian passport. 'I fell free' said The Republic of Benny, raising his arms wide open to the world. Imperial Majesty George II of The Empire of Atlantium Photo: AFP HRH The Crown Princess Greta of Ladonia seems a little less certain of her place amongst royalty. When her mum, Queen Carolyn, came back from work one day and announced that the 17.000 citizens of Ladonia had voted her in as their Head of State, she really wasn't sure what to make of it. She was also more than a little surprised to find that she was next in line to the throne; especially as she wasn't entirely sure where Ladonia actually is (it is located in a national reserve in the south of Sweden). Queen Caroline, however, was clearly born to rule. Her work place managers, back in Washington DC, may have prevented her from adding her full title of 'Her Majesty Queen Carolyn of Ladonia' to the plaque on her office door – apparently it was too long to fit on – but she still aspires to boss people around, whenever the opportunity arises.
