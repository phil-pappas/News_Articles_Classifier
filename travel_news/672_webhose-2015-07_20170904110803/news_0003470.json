I’m seeking advice from lines who see this as an opportunity - we have some champions out there.” \n“We ask users about themselves and their travel preferences, get them to rate the features that are most important to them, and the algorithm throws back a shortlist of cruises most suitable for their needs,” he said. \nHe hopes the tailor-made online format of the site will be particularly attractive to the new-to-cruise market. “Millennials don’t always understand the cruise concept, but other sites don’t talk to first-time cruisers. We will talk to them in a fun, non-corporate, start-up way. \n“They might be online during their lunch break or at 11pm, and they want answers immediately. Forcing people to make a phone call to book is so five years ago. We want to help millennials get the same answers online that they would get in a shop or via a call centre.” \nWerth added that ensuring the right customer was matched to the right cruise would help the site to grow by word of mouth, although he conceded that in the short term he was unable to rule out price matching to be competitive. \n“We don’t want to be a discount house, but if we have to price match to demonstrate a worthwhile concept, we will do it,” he admitted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T19:22:39.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
