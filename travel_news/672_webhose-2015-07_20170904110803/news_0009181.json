Revenue grew by 10% to €1.7 billion. 28 million people flew with the airline up 16% from 24.3 million. \nRyanair managed to lower its unit costs by 7%, which meant it could pass on lower fares to consumers. In the period average fares fell by 4% to €45 “due to the timing of Easter, weaker April yields and lower checked bag penetration”. \nThe improved performance was not enough to persuade the airline to increase its full-year net profit forecast, which remains between €940 million to €970 million. However, Ryanair now says “slightly better H1 yields will push it towards the upper end” of the estimate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T13:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T15:34:37.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
