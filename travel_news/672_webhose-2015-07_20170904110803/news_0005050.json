Â© Anouk Zijlma Train travel in Morocco is easy, cheap and a great way to get around the country. The train station in Fes is relatively small and very easy to navigate. You can catch a train from Fes to Casablanca , Fes , Tangier , Rabat , Marrakech , Meknes and other towns served by Morocco's railway. If you want to head to Chefchaouen or the Merzouga for the Desert, then you're best bet is taking the bus or a private taxi.\n\nBuying Your Tickets You can not make a reservation or purchase a train ticket outside of Morocco . Once you arrive however, go to the Fes train station and you can make reservations and purchase your tickets to anywhere in the country. The trains run often and it is usually not a problem to book just a day, or even a few hours or so in advance of your trip. \nFirst Class or Second Class? The trains in Morocco are divided into compartments, in first class there are 6 people to a compartment, in second class there are 8 people per compartment. If you're booking first class you can get an actual seat reservation, which is nice if you want a window seat since the landscape is wonderful. Otherwise it's first come, first serve but the trains are rarely packed out so you'll always be quite comfortable. The price difference is usually no more than USD15 between the two classes. \nSchedules To and From Fes Below are some of the main schedules of interest, to and from Fes . Please note that scheduled may change, and to double check when you arrive in Morocco for the correct and most up to date travel times. But over the past 5 years, not much has changed, and the times will give you a good indication of the frequency trains travel the routes. Since you cannot purchase train tickets outside of Morocco, this will still be a useful travel tool for planning purposes. Train Schedule from Fes to Casablanca \nThe train from Fes to Casablanca stops in Rabat arriving an hour before you reach Casablanca. The train also stops in Meknes an hour outside of Fes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T14:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T22:50:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
