You don’t miss anything until it’s gone, so it’s good for me to miss the game right now. As soon as it happened, I knew I was in a position to re-light my fire a little bit.”\nThat hunger is serving Bosh well as he works his way back to basketball. He remains on blood thinners, but should be off them soon, which is a necessary step in being cleared for full contact. In the meantime, he has been training in the weight room and on the court.\nHe is also doing exercises to reestablish his lung capacity. He estimates himself at 90 percent and expects to be close to normal once training camp begins in September.\nJohn Raoux Miami Heat’s Justise Winslow (20) moves the ball against the Los Angeles Clippers during the first half of an NBA summer league basketball game, Wednesday, July 8, 2015, in Orlando, Fla. (AP Photo/John Raoux) “It’s a little bit tougher getting back on that horse if you haven’t played in a while,” he said. “It’s good to get it out now as opposed to later. I feel good. My shot feels good. The conditioning is coming along. As far as my feel on the court is concerned, it’s good.\n“I just want that full (lung) capacity… just opening it up all the way and being conscious of those exercises is good for me because I’ll come back in better shape. You don’t think about things like getting more oxygen and expanding your lungs and all that, but it’s something I’ve really paid attention to for obvious reasons.”\nDespite battling a calf injury and eventually the medical issue, Bosh was one of the best players in the league and made his 10th All-Star Game. He averaged 21.1 points and seven rebounds — one of six players in the league to hit those numbers — in 44 games.\nBosh sat with coach Erik Spoelstra, assistant David Fizdale, CEO Nick Arison and other Heat personnel as the team fell to the Celtics 101-69 Tuesday night. Miami begins the tournament portion of the Las Vegas summer league Wednesday or Thursday.\nBosh, 31, went down in February and began his return with brief walks around his neighborhood shortly after. He took an extended break to travel the world with his family, including stops in England, France and Peru.\nOne of the highlights was a hike through the Andes in Peru, which he showed on Instagram with a selfie in front of Machu Picchu.\n“I was in good enough shape,” he said. “The altitude is a beast, too, but we took rests and we stopped.”\nBosh loosely paid attention to the Heat’s free agency moves while he was abroad and was in contact with Dwyane Wade amid the uncertainty of whether he would re-sign. Despite the drama back home, Bosh never worried that Wade and the team would work out a new deal.\nWhat did surprise him, though, was seeing Pat Riley pick up Amar’e Stoudemire and Gerald Green on minimum contracts. Stoudemire is a viable back-up for Bosh at power forward with the ability to complement his game if they are in at the same time.\n“I can’t believe he came — I can’t believe it,” Bosh said of Stoudemire. “He’s just a really good guy and his work ethic, of course. He’s gonna bring veteran leadership and work ethic to the team. I’m excited.”\n“When you feel you’re on the verge of being an elite team and doing something special, guys give up certain things to come and play. That lets me know they want to win now, and I think they’re in the right place.”", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/07/14/d0/19/Clippers-Heat-Basketball.JP.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/07/14/2e/53/480674068.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-15T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T10:10:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
