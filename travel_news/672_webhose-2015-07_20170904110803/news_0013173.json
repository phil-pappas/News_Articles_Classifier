The speakers also highlighted how recent developments, including the approval of Kazakhstan's membership to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) and extension of its visa-free program, would help to promote the country's international brand and make it more attractive to investors and tourists. The new visa policy permits unsupervised travel for 15 days for Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, along with Malaysia , Singapore , and United Arab Emirates . The new policy will help boost tourism, stabilize markets and cross-border trade, and solidify relations. It will also brand Kazakhstan as a cosmopolitan, Western-friendly, emerging economic partner for the West and Asia . Mayor of the city of Almaty Mr Akhmetzhan Yessimov: «Almaty's bid is a key element of our city and region's long-term goals. That is why it has the full backing of our Government, who has guaranteed that any shortfall in the cost will be met. This includes the use of Kazakhstan's $75 billion sovereign wealth fund if required. Kazakhstan has the financial strength to deliver a great Winter Games without spending tens of billions of dollars. Almaty 2022 will serve as a model for future Host Cities and prove that similar developing nations can host the Games affordably and sustainably». With the finish line in sight, Almaty 2022 expressed its optimism heading into the final vote and continued to reiterate the benefits of its unique vision for the Winter Games. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T17:10:36.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
