I think when you start saying ‘don’t go to Russia’ or whatever, I just don’t see how it works, I think you have to be much more subtle about it. \n“And I don’t think in terms of your industry [that] its feasible.” \nFanshawe added: “I don’t think it does much for the gay activists in the country either. They get isolated even further.” \nStonewall was formed in the wake of the then UK Conservative government’s introduction of Section 28, a law that banned local authorities from promoting homosexuality. \nSince then, Fanshawe has enjoyed a successful media career and was awarded an OBE in the New Year’s Honours list 2013 for services to higher education. \n“I don’t think it does much for the gay activists in the country either. They get isolated even further.”Simon Fanshawe \nHe said the next stage of the fight for LGBT equality was both a local and international one, especially with more and more countries passing laws for same sex marriage. \n“We’ve done the large part of the legislative stuff, [now]we need to be right down there in amongst people forming those alliances and creating towns and cities and villages that we want to live in.” \nFanshawe said the global struggle was intensely complex but that things were becoming better, even in the most unlikely of places. \n“It is happening, there are activists now in countries, which ten years ago, it wasn’t even possible to fantasise that there would be activists: in Kenya, Uganda and places like this, it’s extraordinary. \n“And once the genie is out of the bottle you can’t put it back. You can make regressive legal statements and so on and so forth but it’s moving [forward].”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T13:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T13:28:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
