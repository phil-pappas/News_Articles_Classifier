Folklore indicates that wine appeared in Sicily thanks to the efforts of the God Dionysus (aka Bacchus); however, it is more likely that it was introduced by Mycenaean traders who grew grapes in the Aeolian Islands (1500 BC) and grapes continued to be cultivated and enjoyed by the Greeks who settled in Sicily in the 8th century BC. The wine industry is noted in Homer’s Odyssey as Odysseus captures the cyclops, Polyphemus - drunk on wine he blinds him in his single eye and escapes. \nThere is also a Muslim influence on the Sicilian wine industry…they introduced the process for drying grapes into raisins (uva sultana) and the name Marsala comes from the Arab Marsah-el-Allah or Port of Allah. The history of wine making in Sicily is one of the longest in the world and maybe the first place where the word vino was used. \nIn the late 18th century John Woodhouse introduced fortified Marsala wine. The Sicilian winemakers focused on sweet fortified wines because they could withstand the long sea voyages in route to international markets and to compete against the then popular Madeira. \nBy the mid-19th century, Marsala wine had become so popular that Benjamin Inghan and Vincenzo Florio (from Calabria) started competing operations. Florio, one of Italy’s first tycoons, bought up much of the land around Marsala and even today the Florio label remains one of the most important brands in the country. \nMarsala was popular for almost a century; however, by the 1950s the quality of the wine deteriorated and it was found primarily in kitchens and used for cooking (i.e., veal Marsala). Finally, in 1986 Italy’s Republic DO laws were revised and stricter regulations (similar to Portuguese wine controls) raised the quality; once again Marsala wines received respect as aperitif and dessert wines. To move from a quantity to a quality-focus volume producing vineyards were eliminated and replaced with vines trained on cordon trellises to reduce yields. Red and international grape varieties were planted and white grape acreage was reduced to 64 percent. \nMarsala Standards \nMarsala can be categorized into three different standards: oro (golden), ambra (amber) and rubino (ruby). Available as both sweet and dry the term “fine” is used for wine aged for a minimum of one year; “superiore” aged for a minimum of two – three years, “superior riserva” is a vintage wine aged in wood for four to six years and “vergine” is aged in wood for a minimum of five years (or in oak casks for up to seven years). \nThe region producing Marsala wines is located in the Trapani province. Marsala can be served as a dessert or aperitif wines and is a blend of Grillo, Cataratto, Ansonia and Demaschino with the addition of distilled alcohol and is best served chilled. \nAbout the Grapes \nThe area near Palermo (a terrain compared to Napa Valley) is the perfect hot, arid coastal region for grapes. In the eastern vineyard with higher elevations (slopes of Mt. Etna) the hills and mountains with poor soil and intense summer heat and low rainfall makes it a perfect area for viticulture. \nThe native grapes of the region include: Nero d’Avola (Calbrese) for dark, black-fruit driven wines similar to Syrah with notes of currants, cloves and vanilla. Other native red grapes include Perricone and Nerello Mascalese that that used in blends with Nero d’Avola. Sicilian white wines are fresh and fruity with refreshing acidity and grown around Palermo. The most important grapes are Inzolia, Grillo, Catarratto Bianco and Damaschino. \nSicilian red wines include: Nero D’Avola; Syrah; Etna Rosso (blend of 95 percent Nerello Mascalese and 5 percent Nerello Mantellatio (found on the rich, fertile volcanic slopes of Mount Etna, and Cerasuolo di Vittoria (Frappato 40 percent), Nero d’Avola (60 percent). Sicilian white wines include Bianco D’Alcamo (Cataratto 80 percent), Grecanico, Damaschino and Trebbiano (produced between Alcamo and Trapani). Wines from Grillo, Inzolia, Cataratto, Grencanico and Chardonnay are blended together. \nWine Experiences. Where/What to Drink \n1. Donnafugata Wines \nThe brand, Dunnafugata, means woman in flight and references Queen Maria Carolina, wife of Ferdinand IV of Bourbon who left Naples as Napoleon’s troops arrived. She sought protection in Sicily – on the site where the winery’s vineyards are currently located. The Sicilian author, Giuseppe Tornasi di Lampedusa in The Leopard (Il Gattopardo) gave the name of Dunnafugata to the country estates of the Prince of Salina who hosted the queen and how hosts the winery’s vineyards. \n• Ben Rye 2012. Passito di Pantelleria \nThe Grappa is aged in small oak barrels from Zibibbo grapes from the island of Pantelleria (originally from the North African coast). The name is derived from zibibb, an Arabic word meaning dried grape. Pantelleria provides the arid and windy climate that is ideal for these grapes - presenting a concentration of sugars and unique aromas. \nThe pomace is distilled in alembic stills using the discontinuous bain marie method. To the eye, an amber hue that leads to golden bronze. The nose detects a bouquet of honey, apples, lemons, almonds, dried figs, apricots, oranges and herbs. On the palate, very soft sweetness of oranges and a touch of minerality. Pair, at the end of a meal, with plain biscuits, chocolate and cheese. Considered to be Italy’s most pedigreed dessert wine. \n• Trancredi 2011. Sicilia IGP \nFrom Cabernet Sauvignon and Nero d’Avola Tannat blends that are harvested in September, the grapes are macerated in stainless steel on the skins for 12+/- days at a temperature between 79-86 degrees F. After malolactic fermentation the wines ages for 14 months in new and old French oak barrels and fined in the bottle for approximately 24 months. \nTo the eye- a deep purple trending to light red. To the nose – lots of sweet and sour cherries and spice. To the palate – cherries rich in tannins with a dry finish. Pair with red grilled meat, aged cheese and porcini mushrooms. \n• Anthilia 2014 \nThe principal grape is Catarratto blended with other Sicilian and international varieties. Pale yellow to translucent white to the eye, with hints of lemon, lime, orange, green apple and raisin to the nose. A delicious and slightly sour taste experience makes the wine memorable.

Good publicity from the Wine Spectator (cover October 2014 and the global 100 list – the Academy Awards for wine) selected two Sicilian labels: Firriato Santagostino Baglio Sorria rosso 2011 and Tenuta delle Terre Nere Etna rosso 2012. These wines are available in the USA for $22 per bottle are placed with major French and California (Napa and Sonoma) priced at over $100 per bottle. \nIt is only within the last decade that Sicilian wine producers have accepted the logic of improving the quality of their product – if their objective was to successfully compete in the global market. With unemployment at 14 percent, the growth of the wine industry (for export and tourism) will play an important part in economic growth. \nFor your next wine purchase – in a restaurant or wine shop – make your first steps to the Sicilian wine section and purchase a few wines and reds along with the Madeira...dinner guests will definitely be impressed with your selections.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T00:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T02:19:50.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
