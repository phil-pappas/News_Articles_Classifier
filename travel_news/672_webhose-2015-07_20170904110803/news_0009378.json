Credit: Bryon Orford /YouTube \nThe American hunter who killed Zimbabwe's famous lion Cecil has released a statement, saying he thought the hunt was legal. \nDentist Walter Palmer was named this week as the hunter who killed Cecil, while two others face criminal charges for the killing. \n\"To my knowledge, everything about this trip was legal and properly handled and conducted,\" Palmer said in a statement. \nPalmer said all the proper permits were secured by the professional guides he hired. \n\"I had no idea that the lion I took was a known, local favourite, was collared and part of a study until the end of the hunt. I relied on the expertise of my local professional guides to ensure a legal hunt,\" he said. \nThe Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force (ZCTF) has accused Palmer and professional hunter Theo Bronkhorst of luring the lion out of the Hwange National Park with an animal carcass in order to kill him. \nWhile criminal charges have been laid against Bronkhorst and the owner of the land on which the lion was hunted, Palmer says he has not been contacted by Zimbabwean or US authorities. \n\"Again, I deeply regret that my pursuit of an activity I love and practice responsibly and legally resulted in the taking of this lion,\" he said. \nCecil was shot with a bow early in July. Forty hours after the initial shot, he was found wounded and was killed with a gun. He was then beheaded and skinned.
