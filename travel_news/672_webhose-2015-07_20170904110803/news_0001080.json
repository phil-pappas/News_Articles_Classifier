Does the weakened euro, partly the result of the fiscal crisis in Greece, affect whether you should put charges on your credit card in euros or in dollars? Is it legal and safe to use Uber in the wake of protests by taxi drivers throughout Europe, particularly in France where drivers have recently blocked roads to airports and set tires on fire? Do the International Air Transport Association’s efforts to implement more universal carry-on guidelines — a move welcomed by a number of international airlines — mean the time has come to buy a new, smaller rollaboard bag?\nHere’s what you need to know.\nShould you make charges in euros or U.S. dollars? You’re asked at a hotel or restaurant if you would like to pay in euros or dollars. What do you say? The near parity between the euro and the dollar may make it tempting to pay in the latter — but don’t. In general, always choose the currency of the place you’re in. It’s not uncommon for there to be a markup on the currency conversion rate. Even worse, if you pick your home currency you’re typically socked with a service fee known as a dynamic currency conversion fee (or DCC), which can add up to an additional 2 percent, 3 percent, even 6 percent or more, of your bill. If you didn’t ask to pay in dollars but are nonetheless charged in dollars, tell the merchant to reissue your bill in euros. (Also be sure to use a credit card such as Chase Sapphire Preferred or American Express Platinum that doesn’t charge foreign transaction fees.)\nEager to pay in dollars because you want to know right then and there how much you’re spending? Resist the urge and use a currency converter app such as XE ( xe.com/apps ) instead. Do it often enough and you’ll have saved enough money for a little shopping spree.\nAs for travelers planning to visit Greece, it’s possible there may be a few hurdles. In recent weeks some A.T.M.s ran out of cash , resulting in long lines at others. On the other hand, the dollar is strong, making the islands even more alluring to American tourists.\nIs it O.K. to use Uber?
