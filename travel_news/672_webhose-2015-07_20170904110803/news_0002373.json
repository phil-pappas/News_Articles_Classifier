More recently, I joined the 40th anniversary celebrations of Barrhead Travel. In that time, they’ve grown to 850 employees and reached a turnover of £280 million, and no doubt many happy customers. That really is good business. A good, solid business survives the ebbs and flows of the economy to celebrate milestones. \nOther big UK organisations are celebrating big years in 2015. Comic Relief hits 30; it is the 70th anniversary of the British Design Council; and the London School of Economics celebrates its 120th anniversary; and Celebrity Cruises is 25 years young this year. \nLongevity in business is not to be taken for granted. Research by insurers RSA in 2014 shows that 45% of small businesses did not make it to their fifth anniversary. But on a more positive note, in these post-recession years more and more people are starting their own business and nearly half (49%) of recession start-ups have been proven to increase their earnings versus 40% of other companies. Hard times stimulate entrepreneurial behaviour. \nIn fact, to survive for the long-term all businesses - whatever their scale - must be entrepreneurial in spirit. \nRecent shifts in the UK corporate language show us this. The business pages are littered with the efforts of big names who once commanded a decent proportion of all spend or transactions on our high street. Look at Tesco, RBS and Morrisons. You could argue they are united by their scale. Did their struggles begin when they thought they were too big to fail? History tells us that no business is invincible - look at Lehman Brothers and Enron. \nAlso interesting is the boom in businesses started by those who were disgruntled by what was happening around them. Not On The High Street and Net-a-Porter, these people are the business pioneers who drive our economy forward and convince us to change our spending behaviours. A few years ago, I would never have believed that one of my most treasured apps would save me the hassle of raising my arm to hail a taxi. But Uber has changed that and is now available in more than 57 cities. Likewise, Airbnb is changing the way people stay in and experience destinations away from home, whether travelling for business or leisure. In the travel industry we have one of the world’s famous entrepreneurs in Richard Branson. \nThese businesses are united by strong leadership, a proposition that has evolved as customer habits and lifestyles have changed, and a commitment to being a good business and being in it for the long haul. \nAs a cruise line we’ve worked with travel businesses that have long been UK stalwarts. They have evolved, embraced change and worked with us through highs and lows. But our business is only strong because we also embrace new market entrants and recognise a great future partner when we see one. Many of the businesses that have started in the travel sector in the past few years will be market leaders for the long term. And that really is something to celebrate. \n﻿Jo Rzymowska is managing director at Celebrity Cruises", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T12:12:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
