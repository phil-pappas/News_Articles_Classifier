One of those, is former MasterChef contestant Andrew Prior whose Queenie’s Food Tours in Melbourne have become a city fixture. Now he’s branching out into France, with the first two-week trip in September and more to follow in 2016. The former insurance broker couldn’t be more excited to be leading tours to the gastronomic capital of the world visiting markets, specialty gourmet stores, hidden passageways, Michelin star restaurants, leading patisseries, charcuteries and more. Andrew spent an entire year in 2012 researching the extensive food culture of Paris, Dijon and Lyon, and is confident he’s found some real gems. Among the tour highlights, are visits to a snail farm, a world renowned chocolate museum, a gingerbread maker in Dijon and a former royal food garden. Guests will also get to do a pastry cooking class, explore a French mustard factory and dine at a traditional Lyonnaise bouchon. The $9850 cost includes most meals, four-star accommodation, tours, classes and airport transfers. www.queeniesfoodtours.com\nVIRTUAL TOURISM\nTHERE’S not a lot that can’t be done with a smart phone, and soon that will include exploring Hamilton Island in Queensland’s glorious Whitsundays. A new app created by Hamilton Island, Samsung Electronics and Rapid VR allows users to have a “360 Virtual Reality experience” simply by moving their phone in the direction they want to go. The film is also available for viewing through Samsung headsets in Qantas First Class cabins on international flights, and in some Qantas lounges. Although nothing can match the experience of actually visiting Hamilton Island, the film comes pretty close taking viewers into the cockpit of a flight touching down at Hamilton Island Airport, then exploring the resort from the air and below the surface of the tropical waters. The Hamilton Island and Great Barrier Reef app will be available for download in coming weeks.\n Supporters celebrate outside the Supreme Court in Washington, Friday, June 26, 2015 after the court declared that same-sex couples have a right to marry anywhere in the United States. Picture: AP Source: AP\nGETTING HITCHED ON HOLIDAYS\nTHE decision by the US Supreme Court to legalise same sex marriage is tipped to see an influx of Aussies seeking to be betrothed in America. Currently the top overseas wedding destinations for Australians are Bali, Fiji and Thailand but Creative Holidays ’ director James Gaskell thinks the recent court ruling could see the US crack the top three. “We see this growth as being driven by same sex couples who want to exchange vows in a country where their union is recognised,” Gaskell told Check-Out. “Same sex marriage is of course already legal in a number of places around the world including England, Ireland, Brazil and several countries across Europe. However there are a lot of reasons why we believe the US will hold high appeal for destination weddings.” He said the US offered an “ease of accessibility for couples, their friends and families, and was a fantastic destination to enjoy pre or post wedding celebrations”.\nDISCOVERING AMERICA\nTHE Aussie dollar may have lost ground against the greenback in the last year but it’s proving no deterrent to Australian travellers. Australian Bureau of Statistics data for May showed we are continuing to flock to the US in growing numbers, partly due to fierce competition among airlines servicing Trans-Pacific routes. Canada is also hotting up for Aussie travellers, thanks to the good exchange rate and diversity of experiences on offer, and South America is enjoying an Aussie surge on the back of direct flights to Santiago. To assist those people keen to explore the Americas, Flight Centre is staging a series of travel expos around the country bursting with ideas, advice and information. The first Discover the America’s Travel Expos will be held in Adelaide and Brisbane next Sunday, July 26, at the Adelaide Convention Centre and Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre. As well as a mountain of info, there will be exclusive expo-only deals and competitions. From Adelaide and Brisbane, the expo will move to Sydney on August 2, followed by Melbourne and Perth on August 9. www.travelexpo.net.au/discover-americas\n The Barossa Valley in South Australia — the state to be in August. Picture: Getty Images Source: Getty Images\nSIZZLING SA\nSouth Australia is about to embark on its busiest time of the year kicking off, quite literally, with the big Liverpool vs. Adelaide United exhibition match tomorrow night. Featuring England’s most successful club, the match is tipped to pack out Adelaide Oval with fans paying up to $200 a ticket. Following on from that, is the South Australian Living Artists Festival for the entire month of August. The statewide program involves more than 3000 artists and 500 venues celebrating the diverse scope of the visual arts in SA. Also in August, is the Barossa Gourmet Weekend , from the 14th to 16th. Described as a “true feast for the senses” the three-day festival features 30 free and ticketed events. These include food and wine experiences, family fun days, evening entertainment, long lunches, cooking classes and wine master classes.

Next month will see the opening of the Mercure Newcastle Airport , a $15 million property with 95-rooms. Opening month rates start at $150 a night, for soundproofed guest rooms fitted out with blackout blinds, iPod docking stations, high-speed wireless broadband, Foxtel and smart TVs. A bit further south, Fairmont Resort Blue Mountains has unveiled 12 new rooms and suites including the spacious Grand Luxury Suite. Just as the name suggests, the GLS offers 102 square metres of indulgence including gas fireplace, vaulted ceiling, spa bath and dining area. In Tropical North Queensland, Holiday Inn’s Cairns Harbourside will replace the existing Mercure Cairns Harbourside late this year, following a complete refurbishment. The 173-room hotel will bring to Cairns, Holiday Inn’s popular “kids stay and eat for free” program. The timing could not be better with searches on Expedia.com.au showing a 35 per cent surge in interest in Cairns, from frostbitten Sydneysiders and Melbournites.\n Boracay in the Philippines — fast increasing in popularity among Aussie travellers. Picture: iStock Source: Supplied\nISLAND ATTRACTION\nAUSTRALIAN travellers are increasingly warming to the Philippines, with Aussie visitors to the island nation up five per cent in the year to May to 209,200. Although the numbers are not in the ballpark of those flocking to Bali and Thailand, high quality resorts, affordable rates and pristine beaches are attracting rave reviews from visitors to Boracay and Cebu. For those thinking of a Philippines’ fling, Singapore Airlines Holidays is offering some particularly good deals, including seven nights in a deluxe room of the four-star Henann Garden Resort on White Sand Beach, Boracay for $1825 a person, twin share. The price includes return airfares from Australia, daily breakfast and airport transfers. A similar deal is on offer at Shangri-La’s Boracay Resort and Spa for $3045 a person twin-share. Seven night packages at Cebu’s Movenpick Hotel Mactan Island start from $2080 a person twin share, but only from August 23 to September 24.", "external_links": ["http://www.barossa.com/events/2015-barossa-gourmet-weekend", "http://www.expedia.com.au/", "http://www.fairmontresort.com.au/", "http://www.mercure.com/gb/booking/hotels-list.shtml", "https://www.ihg.com/holidayinn/hotels/us/en/reservation", "http://www.creativeholidays.com/sales/HotOffers/index.aspx", "http://www.queeniesfoodtours.com/tours-to-france-2015.html", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/749008-5b6a0ab4-2501-11e5-b9c8-881f1ce24d70.jpg", "http://www.salainc.com.au/", "http://www.travelexpo.net.au/discover-americas", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/749060-2af9e64e-2919-11e5-b51a-609e8c108313.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/749537-44d9280a-2918-11e5-b51a-609e8c108313.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-18T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T11:58:53.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
