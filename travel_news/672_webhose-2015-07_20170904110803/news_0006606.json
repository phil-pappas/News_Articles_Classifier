Kim’s likeness is portrayed in ultimate selfie pose - arm extended and mobile phone poised to capture that perfect picture. \nOMG how amazing is my @MadameTussaudLondon wax figure!!! So cool you can actually take a selfie with her!!! pic.twitter.com/YztkIEXjfO — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) July 9, 2015 \n\nGuests were delighted to slide up beside her and strike their own poses this morning, pressing the button on the figure’s mobile to capture their very own selfie with Kim. And thanks to an ever changing backdrop they all got a very different selfie moment . \n“When we were thinking about how we should portray Kim here at Madame Tussauds London, it quickly became obvious it HAD to be taking a selfie,” said Nicole Fenner, Madame Tussauds London PR manager, in a statement. “But we wanted to make it really special and create a set where guests can take a picture that will look as if they have just bumped into Kim in any number of locations. We are also paying a bit of a tribute to Kim’s own ‘3 image rule’, which dictates you should never take more than three images in the same location. A constantly changing backdrop ensures guests don’t fall foul of that rule with hundreds of different selfie scenes to give people lots of picture perfect experiences.\" \nThx @BalmainParis & @olivier_rousteing 4making my fave dress! I can't wait til I can fit into the same dress & take a selfie w my wax figure — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) July 9, 2015 \n\nBy adding a comment on the site, you accept our terms and conditions .
