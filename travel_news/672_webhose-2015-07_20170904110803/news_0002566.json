During the past decade, visitors bureaus have started collaborating across county and state lines, recognizing that everyone can't operate in their own silos. For example, the American Bus Association will host a convention in Louisville early next year. The Clark-Floyd Counties Convention and Tourism Bureau is creating a dining tour of Southern Indiana for attendees, and it will help promote the tour through a partnership with the Louisville Convention and Visitors Bureau , said Luanne Mattson , director of communications for the Clark-Floyd Convention and Tourism Bureau . \"There is no way we would put on that convention,\" Mattson said, referring to the benefits of being located near a larger city. In the next decade, collaboration in the tourism industry will continue to grow, Carrie Lambert , executive director of the Indiana Tourism Association , said in an interview today. The association is a membership organization that includes mostly visitors bureaus across the state as well as tourist stops. The organization has more than 70 members, represents 54 counties and has a $130,000 budget. \"If you are out visiting or touring somewhere, if you see a county line, do you turn around and say, 'Oh, I really don't want to go to the next county. I want to stay in this county?' No,\" Lambert said. \"It would be crazy for (tourism officials) to act like the world fell off at the border of Indiana.\" At least in Indiana, Lambert said, she believes counties will start to band together, as have the Clark-Floyd Counties Convention and Tourism Bureau, to pool their small budgets to make a larger impact with advertising or capital investments. \"Who is around me? How can we pool our resources?\" she said. Some towns may have enough activities for a day trip, but if it works with another nearby town, the two cities can market themselves as a weekend trip, which attracts people into local hotels and generates tax revenue. Collaboration is the key to building up tourism in the state. \"There are going to be times you compete,\" Lambert said. \"There are going to be times when a business is going to decide: 'I am going to be on this side of the river, or I am going to be on that side of the river.' But at the end of the day, we need to have a working relationship.\" Lobbying for more funding Part of the Indiana Tourism Association's job is to lobby on behalf of the tourism industry, Lambert said, because the state's tourism board can't legally do so. The biggest issue for the group and its members was that the state's tourism budget was $2 million last fiscal year, she said. Ohio had a $5 million budget, and Kentucky and Illinois are even higher. The organization works with a part-time lobbyist to talk to state legislators about the importance of tourism to the state. Their efforts and others have been successful, Lambert said, noting that the state allocated $9 million to tourism over the next two fiscal years. Some of that money will be handed out in the form of grants to tourism businesses and visitors bureaus, she said. To help further that case, the association is working with Ball State University and Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis on a white paper about quality-of-life investments. If a community builds a baseball stadium, for example, the paper would look at the town's statistics before and after the investment. Lambert hopes to take the paper to legislators and say: \"Why wouldn't you give us more money if we can do this with it?\" \nWant Louisville Travel   Home of the Day", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T20:56:55.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
