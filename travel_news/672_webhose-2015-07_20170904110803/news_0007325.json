Out at sea there was the deep hoot of a ferry boat fog horn, joining in the delight. This was precisely what Sir Ben Ainslie had promised when he brought America’s Cup sailing to British waters for the first time since 1851: spectacle, speed, excitement and, most important of all, victory for the local, British boat. His boat. What a day this was for Britain’s most decorated Olympic sailor. Ben Ainslie Racing’s astonishing speed machine came first and second in the first two races of the America’s Cup World Series held in a Solent bathed in sunshine. Overnight in the two-day competition that marks the start of qualification to see who will challenge for the Cup in Bermuda in 2017, Ainslie’s crew is leading the field by a point over the boat from New Zealand. The Americans, the holders, lie in third place, three points behind the British. “I couldn’t have asked for anything better,” said Ainslie after racing had concluded. “Well actually I could: we could have won the second race as well.” The most competitive of sportsmen, Ainslie was not being facetious. He admitted before the start of the weekend series that winning would demonstrate his seriousness. He was not in it, he said, to come second. And this regatta is of huge significance in his bid to fulfil a lifelong dream and win the America’s Cup. It was out there on the choppy waters of the Solent that the country’s most ambitious and expensive sporting campaign got under way. For Ainslie, how he needed it to start with a bang. “We really want to do well in front of the home crowd,” he said. “But we felt well prepared. We just needed to get on with it.” Interactive: Americas Cup map Ainslie has raised nearly £100 million from corporate and government sources to fund his obsession. Over the past two years he has transformed himself from a lone wolf sailor, who accrued gold medals sitting alone on a boat, into a businessman, a fund raiser and a team leader. Plus an agent of civic regeneration. His plan is to build a sustainable maritime design and development business, based in the swish new BAR headquarters constructed in the historic old town wharf. There he has assembled a team of experts to produce a boat sufficiently on the cutting edge of technology to wrest the oldest trophy in world sport from the Americans in 2017 and bring it back home to Britain. This weekend was the start of that process. It is the first time since the British triumph of 1851 that an America’s Cup event has been held in the UK. The Portsmouth event is one of three qualification regattas – the others are in Gothenburg and Bermuda – involving boats from Britain, France, Japan, Sweden, New Zealand and the USA. There will be another three next year before an eventual semi-final and final in the scrap for the right to go head-to-head with the holders. •America's Cup in pictures And along the way Ainslie wants to turn Portsmouth into the world centre of sailing innovation, providing high quality employment for local young talent. He has set up a charity, the 1851 Foundation, to promote his sport as a positive cultural benefit, giving disadvantaged youngsters the chance to do what he did and find lifelong purpose out on the water. Its patron is the Duchess of Cambridge, who will be joining the Portsmouth throng this afternoon, to watch the final couple of races. What he was doing here in the Hampshire high summer, was giving public proof that his project is one that is worthwhile. One of his aims, he insisted, is to put Portsmouth on the map. •America's Cup: all the details And how the town was basking in its moment. In perfect sailing conditions, with a brisk north westerly wind breezing in at around 14 knots fluttering the union flags raised all along the shoreline, there was not an inch of available space on walls, on the beach and in the sizeable grandstand constructed at the front of Southsea Common from which to watch the events. Some 48,000 people lined the shore. A flotilla of small boats some 2,000 strong had formed up to follow the six racing crafts from America, New Zealand, France, Sweden, Japan and Britain. They were joined by half a dozen chartered foot ferries, their decks rammed with VIP spectators. Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran, got an even better seat: he was on the guest berth aboard Ainslie’s boat itself for the second race, discovering that it is, after all, possible to sail fast without sinking. What all of them saw was something entirely new: six boats whizzing close to the shore atop their ski-like foils at speeds of up to 40mph, conducting the sharpest of handbrake turns round marker buoys, constantly vying for space and the best wind. It was Formula One on water, a sparkling amalgam of speed, glamour and technology. And how the crowd loved it. “It was a little bit emotional for us leaving the harbour and seeing so many people,” said Ainslie. “I’ve never seen anything like it in my sailing career. I can’t say thank you enough to all of those who came out to support us.” And now after his first day the British skipper has put himself in pole position to win the opening round of qualifying. “It was fantastic,” he said. “But having said, there’s a long, long way to go. We’re not getting carried away. Tomorrow is double points, more difficult conditions. Really, that was just the start.” Just the start, perhaps. But what a start.
