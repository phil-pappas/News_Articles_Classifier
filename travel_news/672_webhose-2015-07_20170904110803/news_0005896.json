We’re not talking about an 80s Tom Selleck movie, but a the modern bromance that is MasterChef.\nFor six years, Australia has been listening to three blokes banter about food. And watching them chat is like eating the perfect sticky date. Just enough pudding, with just enough dates, soaked in just enough sauce.\nDelicious.\nBut as any cook will tell you — the ingredients don’t always make the meal. It has to be made with love.\nAnd there’s little doubt there’s a lot of love between Australia’s three MasterChef judges — Gary Mehigan, George Calombaris and Matt Preston.\nWho would have thought a couple of top Melbourne chefs and a restaurant reviewer who enjoys wearing loud cravats and patterned pants would be going this strong after six seasons?\nAfter six season Gary Mehigan and Matt Preston are clearly still great mates. Source: News Corp Australia\nAnd not a bad word between them. Not even a sliver of a rumour about bad blood.\nIt’s so unlike all the other reality shows on our TV screens. The Block, MKR, I’m a Celebrity. They’re packed to the rafters with stroppy and tired contestants or bitchy judges. Lately, even family-friendly The Voice has been plagued with gossip about a vicious catfight between Australia’s darling Delta Goodrem and British pop sensation, Jessie J. And sometimes all that dynamo is, well, a little exhausting.\nThe manufactured drama on other reality shows is getting a bit much. Source: Channel 9\nMasterChef rolled onto our TV screens as cocky as a rare fillet of beef. Robust and raw, ready to tackle a landscape of reality shows. It was an instant success. But after a couple seasons — and for quite a few more — the show stopped delivering and it sank like a sad souffle. It became too much about the contestants, not enough about the food.\nThis year, the formula was tweaked. Perhaps ever so slightly. Just a little zest can make all the difference, right?\nBut the one thing that’s remained the same throughout the years of high’s and low’s are the three judges.\nSix years on, their success is in their team. Just like there’d be no Victoria Beckham without David. And there’d be much less fuss over David Beckham without Victoria. Their strength is in unity.\nThe bouncy, overenthusiastic chef, George continues to shovel down food prepared by contestants with his quite terrible table manners. Fellow-chef-judge, Gary, still goes in for seconds with childlike excitement when he’s pleased with a meal. Reviewer, Matt, goes on to reveal absolutely nothing until he speaks.\nIt seems like nice guys, with bad table manners really can get ahead. Source: Supplied\nBut the most impressive trait is their honesty and warmth.\nSurely, there’s a real knack to giving constructive feedback to a vulnerable home-cook without sounding mean but they perfect it every time.\nPerhaps it’s because of the most obvious underlying feeling on the show.\nRespect.\nBetween the judges.\nBetween the people they welcome on to their show.\nAnd for the food they eat.\nThere’s no doubt a lot of it comes to life with beautiful music — uplifting and dramatic — and some great editing. Just like no restaurant serves up a cake still in its tin, nor does this program serve up a meal straight from the kitchen. This cake has been cooled, iced and served with strawberries and cream.\nWho wouldn’t come back for more of that?\nBecause it makes you feel good.\nA successful onscreen TV relationship is the formula to a great show. It’s no secret that sometimes they work and sometimes they don’t. But when they do … everyone wins. And there’s no arguing that the bond between these three judges is simply quite magic.\nAnd for that, surely this show deserve an immunity pin for 2016.\nMasterChef: A show that deserves an immunity pin.
