Other measurements are also made. Temperature, precipitation, accessibility, population density: all are calculated, and a level of ‘nordicity’ can be assigned, according to a scale developed in the 1970s by the geographer Louis-Edmond Hamelin.” Tallack opts to follow the 60th parallel of longitude, which passes through his Shetland home; Greenland; a whole swath of Canada and Alaska; a still greater swath of Siberia; the former Russian capital, St Petersburg; Finland, Sweden and Norway; before eventually depositing him back by the ancient broch – or fortified iron age dwelling – on the Shetland isle of Mousa, which is where he began.\nTallack is keen to stress that the boreal is no ultima Thule : “Above all else, for those who live there, the north is home. It is neither remote nor isolated nor far away; it is the centre of the world.” I’d agree with him there: I may not have his nordicity CV, but I’ve spent a fair amount of time in the Northern Isles of Scotland, and lived a blustery winter in Orkney during which my sense of the world’s orientation was radically recalibrated: Spitsbergen became a plausible holiday destination, and Edinburgh seemed a positively balmy prospect, while London steamed in my imagination. And I, too, have been taken by the sensuous lines of the ancient brochs – after a trip to Shetland I had a scale model of Mousa built in my very metropolitan back garden. Where I further cleave to Tallack is in his belief that our relationship with place is fundamentally emotional (or should be).\nThis, then, is a book about belonging rather than a conventional travelogue. Tallack is one of a burgeoning group of young travel writers – of whom Robert Macfarlane is the cynosure – who have reinvigorated their increasingly tired genre with elements of psychogeography: the study of how places make us feel. These journeymen and women understand intuitively – if not explicitly – that the globalised world is all used up when it comes to strange vistas and marvellous creatures; now the only course for the true adventurer is to strike out for the known, then accurately record your own resultant sense of the unheimlich . The problem for the new school is they lug along in their knapsacks the same standard-issue English romanticism as their forebears – Leigh Fermor , Thubron , Newby et al. This makes their writing oddly strained, as they try to mitigate their entirely understandable sense of alienation (after all, what are they up to, pretending to “explore” using scheduled public transport?), by slapping down on the page dollops of either nature writing or pained self-analysis.\nWith Macfarlane this can result in prose that, while trying to make it new, often only succeeds in contributing to the self-styled “heritage industry”; with his disciple it leads on occasion to a far more painful spectacle: a tyro writer fighting desperately not to be overwhelmed by cliche. Walking along a way-marked trail near Uppsala in Sweden, Tallack comes upon a series of boulders with brightly coloured pebbles arranged atop them. He reads an info-screed that tells him this is a “place of meditation”, while the pebbles are “pearls of life”, an “aid for modern pilgrims for the greatest and most significant of journeys – the journey inwards”. Tallack wants to reject this ascription “for the mawkishness of it made me wince”, yet he cannot prevent himself from a passage of breast-beating “Whither goes I?”, followed right on cue by nature: “For a few minutes I stood there unmoving, as a woodpecker thrummed nearby and a pair of nuthatches scraped at the corrugated bark of a pine.”\nIt’s as if the Uppsala district council were in the business of printing leaflets instructing British travel writers when to limber up their pathetic fallacies. But to be fair to Tallack, his weaknesses – in all senses – are also his strengths. His own fundamental disjunction from space-time – the one that makes him such a percipient gauge of belonging – occurred when, aged 16, he went for a day’s fishing with his father by a lake in Surrey. At some point in the afternoon his father went off to run an errand – and never came back, having been killed in a car crash. This loss occurred just at the point Tallack was considering moving away from Shetland, where he’d been brought up by his mother after his parents’ separation. To make matters more traumatically complicated, he had been intending to move south and live with his father while he completed his education.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The beginning and the end of Tallack’s journey … the isle of Mousa, Shetland. Photograph: Adrian Davies/Alamy Such a trauma, understandably, has encapsulated the writer in estrangement – and it’s in this invisible yet durable mobile home that he undertakes his circumnavigation. Not a big talker, Tallack begins by avoiding a conversation with a man on Mousa who’s using a GPS to find the 60th parallel: “I could have spoken to him, told him that we were both looking for the same thing, but somehow the seconds passed and we continued to stand there, each hoping the other would just go away.” Having the same disposition, I found Tallack’s rather gloomy introversion a tonic. In Greenland he chats to a happy drunk or two, and discusses global warming with Inuit hunters whose livelihood is melting away, but mostly he is focused on the history of the place, and its significance as one of the few sites where Viking colonisation failed. In the Canadian arctic he receives a lecture on the nature of home from a First Nations activist, Francois Paulette – one that leaves him wondering if “European cultures have entirely lost the traditions by which a relationship with the land is maintained, (in which case) are we then destined to be estranged from our places? Can we never truly be at home?”\nTallack’s journey isn’t set up as being continuous, and as it progresses he interleaves it with more and more of his rootless backstory. In Alaska he hangs out with Jeff, an old university friend, and their mutual alienation is, in some sense, healed by Jeff’s own growing sense of belonging: he’s building a cabin in the wilderness that has claimed him. Meanwhile, Tallack cannily observes of tourists visiting this wilderness that they are being sold “the promise of their own absence”, a neat characterisation of humanity’s paradoxical wanderlust. But while travel writing of this new school rightly eschews faux-purist completism, I nonetheless thought Tallack’s take on Siberia – which, after all, constitutes about half the land mass along his route – was pretty feeble. He writes of the love affair he had with the Kamchatka peninsula in his early 20s, and on this basis he gives the rest of this vast region a swerve, hopping straight from Alaska to St Petersburg.\nThis makes of the back end of book feel oddly truncated – as if Tallack is racing to get back to Shetland. Finnish sauna interludes and his encounter with the “pearls of life” in Sweden hardly put on the brakes, because as the journey draws to its conclusion it inevitably becomes an Eliotic conceit (“And the end of all our exploring / Will be to arrive where we started”). But just as the Four Quartets attempt to say something profound about our being-in-the-world in the Einsteinian era, so Tallack gropes towards comprehending his own homing instinct. He writes of the three years he spent living on remote Fair Isle, and develops an idea of home as communitarian: “My desire was not really to talk, it was to be known. I wanted to be enclosed and included within that thing of which these people were a part.” This he contrasts with our modern rootless condition, in which we simply pick up sticks in order to chase the almighty pound, inducing a relationship with place that has all the attributes of “a loveless marriage”. Tallack does travelogue well, acutely balancing fact and fancy, and he has a nicely febrile line in his own vulnerability. Whether or not his insights into place amount to much more than a hill of beans with a flag stuck in it remains to be seen, because in completing his journey home this promising writer has also finished his gap years; now he must get on with the hard graft of lifelong alienation.\n• To order 60 Degrees North for £10.39 (RRP £12.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.
