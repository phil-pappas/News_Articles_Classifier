Whether passengers are using their smart phone as their eTicket, their tablet for entertainment purposes, an eReader for catching up on reading, etc., it is imperative that these small electronics stay charged for use. To eliminate stressful situations, such as searching for a wall outlet to charge devices before boarding a plane, passengers agree that a portable charger is a quick fix to a never-ending problem.\n\nPermaCharger   11,000 mAh portable battery charger video tutorial offers portable chargers in two capacities- the 8,000 mAh (available in 2 colors) and the 11,000 mAh (available in 3 colors). Each portable charger comes with free accessories to facilitate the charging experience - an AC USB wall adapter, an iPhone 5/6/6 lightning cable, 1 micro cable & 3 USB connectors. These connectors and cables charge major brands such as Nokia, Samsung, Android's, LG, HTC, Kindle, Motorola, Nexus, iPhone 4/4s/5/5s/5c/6/6, all iPad generations, all iPod generations, some Cameras, as well as many other smart phones. Below are several Amazon customer reviews that mention the portable chargers' helpfulness while being used in airports.\n\nOne male customer who purchased the 8000 mAh portable battery charger stated:\n\"This charger is perfect for traveling. It's so light that I could barely notice it in my carry-on luggage, and the charger's surface did not get scratched or harmed - its durability is spot-on. It charged my devices quickly, and I was able to use the charger several times before it needed to be recharged. My friend and I used this device during our travels, and the built-in cables & included accessories allowed for us to recharge our devices simultaneously.\"\n\nAnother male customer, who purchased both the 11000 and 8000 portable charger models, said the following in his customer review:\n\"This will be a great travel charger to have for our upcoming honeymoon in Asia - we won't have to worry about our devices losing too much battery life, or search for a compatible electrical outlet. Since this model has a built-in micro cable and is extremely lightweight, we will probably use this charger more to carry around and to charge our android devices, and use the 11,000 mAh model for tablets that have larger batteries.\n\nA female customer who purchased the 11000 portable charger model when it was newly launched was relieved when she could use the charger to pass the time on her iPad:\n\"I threw the charger in my bag and took it to the airport with me. I had a 2 hour layover and it came in handy charging my iPad, so I could study. It was convenient because it came ready to use. It charged my iPad relatively quickly.\n\nAnother customer who recently purchased the 11,000 model was able to help himself and his friend while traveling:\n\"I used it when I travelled and it a such a relief to not have to worry about my phone's battery level because I know I have a battery pack to charge my phone when the power level gets low. I was also able to help my friend when his phone died and he did not have his phone charger with him.\"\n\nThese portable chargers are backed by a 1-Year FREE Replacement Warranty & a 90-Day Money Back Warranty.
