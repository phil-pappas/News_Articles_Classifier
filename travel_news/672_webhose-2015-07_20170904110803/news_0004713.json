I’d Like a Burger, Fries and Skinny Jeans MoneyTalksNews 2 days ago Krystal Steinmetz Ah, room service – one of the most convenient perks of staying in a hotel. Gap and Virgin Hotels have teamed up to take room service to a whole new level. Guests at Virgin Hotels Chicago can now have Gap clothes delivered for free to their hotel room door.\nIt’s an interesting new room service offering that’s aimed at providing a convenience for busy travelers, while potentially providing a small boost in sales for the struggling retailer .\n“Gap is always exploring new ways to respond to the many ways people shop, whether online, in store or on the go,” said Tricia Nichols, Global Lead of Consumer Engagement and Partnerships for Gap, in a statement . “Traveling can be full of unexpected surprises – weather, lost baggage or you just want something new. Through this partnership, our goal is to provide shoppers convenience, ease and on-trend fashions, all through the touch of a button.”\nThe service, which is currently only offered to travelers staying at Virgin’s Chicago location, works like this: hotel guests shop and reserve items using gap.com ‘s Reserve in Store feature, which can be accessed through VirginHotels.com or Lucy, the hotel’s app.\nThe clothing items are delivered for free to their hotel room within three hours. Consumers can then try on the items and make a purchase.\n© Flickr user 'Brett L.' Gap QuickLook 14 - Bag minimized Similar to traditional room service, the purchase is charged to the customer’s room, according to Internet Retailer .\nThis could be a lifesaver for busy travelers who find themselves far away from their closet and in need of a new outfit but with no time to shop. (It could also be a real sinkhole for impulse buyers!)\n“Having your trip’s wardrobe delivered straight to your chamber, all by clicking a button, is a service we know our guests will love,” said Doug Carrillo, vice president of sales and marketing at Virgin Hotels.\nRead more:\n• Best (and Worst) Airports for Saving Time and Money\n• That Plan to Shrink Carry-On Bags?
