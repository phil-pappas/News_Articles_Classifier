The 299-room luxury beachfront resort, designed by renowned architect Jim Olson in collaboration with Mexico City-based design firm IDEA Asociados, is dedicated to cherishing and showcasing Los Cabos’ natural environment and traditions. \n“A rich destination with a deep cultural narrative, our newest resort property will provide guests with first-hand luxury experiences and unexpected discoveries in a captivating part of the world,” said Mitzi Gaskins, Vice President, Luxury Brand Management & Guest Experience at Marriott International. “JW Marriott Los Cabos Beach Resort & Spa combines local flavor, world-class design by Jim Olson and JW Marriott’s signature service to offer an authentic and enriching experience to guests.” Situated in the upscale Puerto Los Cabos community, JW Marriott Los Cabos Beach Resort & Spa resides amidst the desert dunes of Baja California Sur, Mexico, at the point where the Sea of Cortez and the Pacific Ocean converge to overlook the “aquarium of the world.” Upon entering the open-air lobby, guests will be immediately greeted by the sea and the resort’s expansive infinity pools, creating the effect of the ocean merging with the property itself. The resort will boast well-appointed guest rooms and suites – all with unobstructed ocean views – in addition to seven restaurants, a world-class spa & fitness center, beach club, banquet and meeting facilities, and retail shops. The resort’s architectural design will also provide idyllic spaces to display international works of contemporary art from renowned international artists. “JW Marriott Los Cabos Beach Resort & Spa was designed to complement the beauty of the surrounding environment, blending natural elements with modern details to bring local tradition and culture to life in an unparalleled way,” said General Manager Mike van der Kroft. “This approach to design brings a heightened hotel experience unlike any other to the southern Baja California Peninsula, and we look forward to welcoming our first guests this fall.” JW Marriott Los Cabos Beach Resort & Spa will offer seven restaurants and bars, including its signature Café des Artistes, a Mexican fine dining experience with French influences helmed by award-winning Chef Thierry Blouet. The restaurant will have both indoor and outdoor seating, a carefully curated wine cellar selection highlighting the best of Baja California vintages, a chef’s private table and a bar area. Other food & beverage establishments include Nak & Grill Bar, offering open-grilled local seafood dishes, as well as P’yote Rooftop Bar, which will feature an extensive list of cocktails to be enjoyed on the hotel’s upper terrace. The Jasha Spa will span more than 21,000 sq. ft. and include 12 treatment rooms, an outdoor garden and patio, vitality pools, an indoor pool, and private Jacuzzis. The property will also house a modern version of the traditional temazcal, a Mexican sweat lodge used by ancient Aztecs as a therapeutic instrument to promote healing, health and well-being. Guests will also have access to Puerto Los Cabos’ private marina and golf courses designed by Greg Norman and Jack Nicklaus. Additionally, JW Marriott Los Cabos Beach Resort & Spa will offer more than 37,000 sq. ft. of space for corporate and social events. Facilities will include a 7,950 sq. ft. Mila Ballroom, with six smaller rooms adjacent to the foyer and an oceanfront Amet Patio. The Kepe gazebo, with a magnificent view of the Sea of Cortez, will be the ideal venue for wedding ceremonies. Inspired by ancient Greek forums, the 7,104 sq. ft. Sum-San amphitheater will provide space for guests to enjoy performing art events or special celebrations under the stars. Stadium seating will surround the amphitheater stage, set among lush gardens and a naturally occurring chiaroscuro, providing guests with a culturally rich experience. The resort will also boast several private and semi-private terraces and gardens. For those looking for a highly personalized and private experience, the property will feature the Griffin Club, an ultra luxurious 45-room boutique hotel within the resort. Griffin Club guests will enjoy exclusive amenities such as a movie theater, private beach and pool, reserved Jasha Spa areas, the Mayma Lounge Bar with a fireplace, and a private business center with meeting rooms and an event space. Conveniently located 25 minutes from Los Cabos International Airport, JW Marriott Los Cabos Beach Resort & Spa will offer world-class amenities, on-property cultural events, and a variety of land and sea excursions. Opening rates begin at $450 per night and $560 for the Griffin Club, room only.
