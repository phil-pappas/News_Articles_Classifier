PUBLISHED: 10:10, Sat, Jul 25, 2015 | UPDATED: 10:17, Sat, Jul 25, 2015 SHREK'S ADVENTURE LONDON ALL AGES: Something for everyone to enjoy \nWE ARE sitting in a red London Routemaster bus when my six-year-old daughter, Cara, notices that Donkey, her favourite character from the Shrek films, is in the driving seat. \nSuddenly the bus station lights go dark and we’re off, zooming into the night sky, narrowly missing the top of the London Eye. \nAs the bus ducks and weaves, we are thrown from side to side and splashed with jets of water. \nWe spot a whole host of familiar animated characters including the penguins from Madagascar and Kung Fu Panda flying alongside us. \nMy daughter clings to my hand, her eyes agog behind her giant 3D specs. \nObviously this is no ordinary bus journey but the brilliantly-realistic 4D magical ride that kicks off the new Shrek’s Adventure! tour on London’s South Bank. \nThe storyline for our adventure is that we are setting off on a fun-packed journey to the land of Far Far Away to meet Shrek, the grumpy but kind-hearted green ogre, and his fairy tale friends. \nNot surprisingly things go wrong when our bus accidentally bumps off one of Rumpelstiltskin’s favourite witches and we must embark on a quest to find Shrek and the magic portal that will take us back to London. \nAlong the way we visit 10 key locations that will be familiar to anyone who has seen the films, including Shrek’s swamp, the Poison Apple pub and Muffin Man’s house, all the time being chased by Rumpelstiltskin and his army of witches. \nThe attention to detail is amazing. \nShrek’s swamp really is damp and smelly and you can smell the cinnamon in the air as we approach the Muffin Man’s house with its bubbling cauldron. \nWe are helped along in our quest by characters from the films. \nSome are actors dressed in costume while others are clever computer-animated special effects. \nAnd the script is funny enough to keep adults entertained as well as the youngsters. \nWe meet the hilariously-posh, blonde Cinderella who sounds like she has jetted in from reality TV show Made In Chelsea with her exclamations of “OMG” and “totes amazing”. \nWe are then rescued from a mind-boggling mirrored maze by Sleeping Beauty, who keeps falling asleep mid-sentence as she tries to tell us where to find Shrek. \nEach tour is limited to 30 or so people so it doesn’t feel overcrowded and everyone can see what is going on. \nThere is also an element of audience participation so be warned if you’re not keen on that kind of thing! \nWe all have to launch into a rendition of the Monkees hit I’m A Believer before we can get on the bus. \nSome of those in our party look baffled but the children join in with gusto. \nThe tour is aimed at those aged six and over and I think that’s about right. \nThere were some tiny children in our group who looked a trifle bewildered by the dazzling array of lights, sound effects and some of the more menacing characters. \nEven my usually imperturbable daughter was a little unnerved by the idea that we were being chased by Rumpelstiltskin’s witches and, at one point, asked in a worried voice whether they were going to catch us. \nOur tour concluded with the “opportunity” to buy a souvenir book for £35, which includes pictures we had unwittingly posed for earlier superimposed on to scenes from the film. \nWe were also offered the chance to pose and take our own free snaps with Shrek and other DreamWorks characters from Madagascar, How To Train Your Dragon and Kung Fu Panda. \nAfter we successfully negotiated the exit via the eye-poppingly expensive gift shop, we caught a (sadly, non-magical) bus home. \nTHE KNOWLEDGE Shrek’s Adventure!
