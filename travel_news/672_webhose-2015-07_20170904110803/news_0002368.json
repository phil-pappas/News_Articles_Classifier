But $25 per firearm isn’t onerous, he insists.\nBurgess says business owners rang alarm bells in the same way before the city passed laws mandating sick leave for workers and a higher minimum wage.\nThe Illinois county that includes Chicago, which has been plagued by some of the nation’s worst gun violence, adopted a tax of $25 per firearm in 2012 and is now collecting about $800,000 per year in revenue, he said.\nBurgess says the point of the legislation isn’t to put gun stores out of business. But he isn’t particularly worried about them shutting down or being forced out. He says he’s more concerned about what shootings cost victims, neighborhoods and taxpayers.\nAnd recognizing that many guns used in crimes aren’t legally obtained, Burgess is also proposing to require that gun owners tell police when they lose or have a firearm stolen.\n“This isn’t an anti-gun measure,” Burgess said. “It’s an attempt to mitigate the negative public-health implications of gun violence. Now, I will acknowledge it would be ideal if this tax could be statewide. Maybe our leadership can help accomplish that.”\nTo estimate how much revenue Burgess’ tax might raise, Seattle finance officials obtained the annual number of background checks for gun sales in Washington.\nThen they looked up what percentage of Washington’s licensed gun dealers were in Seattle and used that to guess the number of firearms sales in the city, said Glen Lee, the city’s finance director.\nThere were 22 licensed dealers listed in the city when the officials checked. Some are actual stores, including three Big 5 Sporting Goods locations. But more are either pawnshops or individuals mostly serving as middlemen for Internet firearms sales.\nWhen someone buys a gun online, the purchase is shipped to a dealer who conducts a background check and charges the buyer a fee before handing the gun over.\nUnder Burgess’ proposal, dealers facilitating those transactions wouldn’t be taxed, Lee says. Internet retailers could be taxed, but only if they’re located in Seattle. Lee says officials took Internet sales into account when they gave Burgess his figures.\n“We feel confident that the range we’ve provided is relatively conservative,” Lee said.\nTodd Hildebrand, a White Center-based dealer, says about 90 percent of his transactions are Internet transfers, so the proposed tax wouldn’t really affect business like his. But he agrees with Solyanik about how the legislation would affect brick-and-mortar sales.\n“The public won’t buy ammunition in Seattle anymore,” Hildebrand said. “When a $10 or $15 box of ammunition costs an extra five bucks, it won’t be worth it.”\nThere aren’t huge numbers of guns and bullets being sold in Seattle stores. Solyanik says Precise Shooter sold 612 firearms and 115,160 rounds from January through June, not counting third-party transfers.\nBill Osberg, who works at the Capitol Loans in West Seattle, says the pawnshop clears about 15 to 20 gun sales a month, not counting transfers.\n“You never know what people are going to do,” Osberg ruminated, speaking for himself only — not on behalf of Capitol Loans. “I really don’t know. Sometimes $5 is important to someone and sometimes $50 doesn’t matter.”\nBurgess says his office has been flooded with emails about the proposed tax.\n“The reaction has been mixed,” he said. “We’re getting a ton of emails arriving from outside Seattle and across the country in opposition. But we’re getting emails of support, as well.”\nThe council’s other eight members are each supporting the bill, as is the mayor, so it’s more or less a done deal, says Burgess. The city will likely be sued by gun-rights advocates if the legislation is approved.\nDaniel Beekman: 206-464-2164 or dbeekman@seattletimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T06:07:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
