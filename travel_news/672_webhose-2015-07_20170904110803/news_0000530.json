Hosted within Middle Temple’s beautiful secluded gardens, screenings will run over three nights in September featuring two of Baz Luhrmann’s colourful masterpieces: Moulin Rouge! and The Great Gatsby as well as Bernstein’s musical classic West Side Story. \nAll screenings are open to the public, but for the first time Middle Temple has fenced off one night purely for the corporate market. Event planners and event agencies looking for fun, alternative, group incentive events can book: The Great Gatsby. The gala showing is designed as a premium shared party experience, mirroring the lavish plot of the film, for corporate groups. Corporate guests will have VIP use of Middle Temple’s award-winning gardens, prior to viewing the film, to unwind and enjoy food and drinks (covered in the ticket price). Upgrades to enhance the experience are available on request including luxury picnic hampers and summer inspired cocktails. Event caterers FoodShow, accredited suppliers at Middle Temple, will provide gourmet bites at the gala screening. Guests can tuck into Angus beef burger with lettuce and tomato or panko crusted parmesan and sautéed leek burger with tomato chutney both served in a brioche bun, accompanied by two salads of baby new potato, caramelised red onion, crispy shoots and radish and classic Waldorf salad with compressed apple, celery and toasted walnut. Cocktails served alongside eats include the Gin Ricky a refreshing combo of gin, lime and soda water and the Belmont Jewel a tantalising mix of bourbon whiskey, pomegranate and lemonade.
