They have different emotions. And we have strong support mechanisms (for the players).\n“But I can’t tell you how much time we will need to move on ….”\nWest Coast coach Adam Simpson praised the Crows for being “first class” in the way they played their first game since losing Walsh.\nBrownlow Medallist and Eagles midfielder Matt Priddis described the Crows as “very spirited” in their approach to a game that clearly tested more than their football prowess.\nAdelaide, after a brave fightback in the first quarter, was beaten by West Coast’s eight-goal second term.\nCamporeale opted to remain in the “football mode” in his half-time address when players, as key defender Daniel Talia noted, had their “minds wander”.\n“We had a ‘man conversation’ at half-time,” said Camporeale referring to a Walsh expression. “And it was simple — it was about getting our hands on the ball.”\nThe strain on the Crows was obvious at the end of the game — when Adelaide’s win-loss column was left at 7-6 ahead of Sunday’s Showdown with Port Adelaide at Adelaide Oval.\nAt the start, Camporeale sensed his players were ready to compete against an AFL pacesetter.\n“I could not be prouder of them for their preparation — and they did play some good footy in patches,” Camporeale said.\n“We have now gone through some firsts — first training session, first pre-match, first game. We have gone through a lot.\n“The players were keen to get out there. And I could not be prouder of them.”\nOriginally published as Campo ‘couldn’t be prouder’ of his men", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/interim-coach-scott-camporeale-couldnt-be-prouder-of-brave-crows/story-fni5f4l8-1227438537284"], "published": "2015-07-12T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T00:18:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
