Hyannis, Provincetown, Martha’s Vineyard and especially Nantucket ooze New York and Boston wealth, and are not for the thin-of-wallet or those who hate crowds. (During the high season, highways and the main bridge leading to the Cape can be jammed with some of the 13 million people who flock here every year.) \nBut there’s a secret, discovered by Canadians who are well-known in the United States for finding value: Plan now to visit Cape Cod and the islands during the shoulder seasons — September-October or before the Memorial Day weekend in May. \nOur May off-season exploration, blessed with a full week of wonderful weather, perfect for all activities save dips in the ocean, revealed why this region, rich in history, beauty, the arts and dining is so popular. \nHere are our five favourite places to see on Cape Cod: \nHYANNIS \nThis is hallowed ground. Hyannis and Hyannis Port in the town of Barnstable are where generations of Kennedys played — the Camelot of Cape Cod when JFK was president. The family “compound” is actually a series of homes on the same public street. \n\n\nThere is a self-guided walking tour of Kennedy points of interest, including St. Francis Xavier Roman Catholic Church, where respectful visitors can sit in the pew once occupied by John F. Kennedy, the JFK Museum filled with family photos, and the outdoor JFK Memorial overlooking the harbour where the president once sailed. It’s the same memorial plaza that was covered with flowers in 1999 after John Kennedy Jr. crashed his plane into the Atlantic in another chapter of this family’s, some say, “cursed” life. \nDowntown and the harbour are packed with interesting eateries. The wait to get into the nautical Black Cat Tavern, which serves delicious seafood, is worth it. The outdoor patio, equipped with torch heaters provides comfortable dining a stone’s throw from the harbour. \nBut the best view of the marina was enjoyed from the large deck of our second-storey suite at the charming Anchor-in. Our pretty loft intriguingly included a book on Jackie Kennedy Onassis, and, on a separate shelf, one on Marilyn Monroe, a famous JFK acquaintance. \nHyannis harbour is where we caught the ferry to Nantucket. \nPROVINCETOWN \nLocated on the fingertips of arm-shaped Cape Cod, Provincetown is where the pilgrims first landed, though they soon moved on to Plymouth. \nThe charming Provincetown skyline is dominated by the 77-metre-tall Pilgrim Monument set on a hilltop overlooking the bustling downtown and harbour filled with whale-watching boats and pleasure craft. The tower, marking the first landing of the Mayflower Pilgrims in 1620, was completed in 1910. Visitors can scale the tallest all-granite structure in the U.S. in about 10 minutes via its 116 steps and 60 ramps. \nProvincetown’s colourful narrow streets bustle with artisan shops and eateries, including the world famous Lobster Pot. \nLike many locales in Cape Cod, well-behaved dogs are omnipresent. So, no surprise Provincetown boasts the unique Friends of Heart animal lovers boutique offering an extravaganza of arty animal gifts and souvenirs. \nThe lively town also boasts a 12-month calendar of parades, festivals and concerts and is one of the most liberal and LBGT communities in the world. Massachusetts’ first gay weddings were celebrated here. \nFALMOUTH \nToo often overlooked by visitors making a beeline to Woods Hole and the ferry to Martha’s Vineyard, Falmouth (pronounced Fal-mith, rhymes with Plymouth) at the shoulder of Cape Cod, is an ideal spot to walk along serene beaches. \nVisitors should take full advantage of reasonably priced downtown eateries such as Bear In Boots Gastropub, where smartly attired 8-year-old Charlie Rickard helps out with the family business. A few doors down we enjoyed the lively ambience of a packed Stone L’Oven Pizza, watching a pizza dough-spinning ace toss our soon-to-be delicious dinner high above his head. Craft beers were also in good supply. \nFalmouth was home to Katharine Lee Bates, who wrote America the Beautiful. \nNearby is the Nobska lighthouse and Woods Hole, the oceanographic institution responsible for discovery of the Titanic. \nNANTUCKET \nThe gem of Cape Cod, Nantucket is a must-see destination for everyone who loves visiting the States. \nLocated 50 km offshore, Nantucket reigned as the whaling capital of the world from the mid-1700s to the late 1830s and as such was hugely prosperous. Its seamen were experts in hunting and processing sperm whales, the oil from which powered industrialization until oil was discovered beneath the ground of Pennsylvania. \nThat wealth translated into construction of huge, gorgeous homes occupied by America’s elite. \nThe last whaling ship left harbour in 1869, but not before the fleet had been decimated by the Civil War. As whaling declined, two-thirds of the island population left. Yet the pre-Civil War homes, streets and commercial buildings still stand. Today, Nantucket has 800 pre-Civil War buildings. \nNantucket rose from being a near ghost island, where sheep farming and other endeavours failed, to becoming an artists’ colony and summer vacation mecca in the post-World War years. Today, in high season, its most elegant rooms can rent for $1,000 a night and converted fish shacks on the waterfront sell for $1 million. \nAs guests in a spacious suite at the elegant, yet cozy, White Elephant Village we leisurely discovered Nantucket on foot. Cars are discouraged and mostly unnecessary as the island’s charm is easily accessed by bicycle or by taking a van tour hosted by knowledgeable locals. \nSixth-generation islander Gail Johnson regaled us with tales of Nantucket and shared a drive-by of her family’s “estate,” appropriately named Tour’s End, a sweet spot of land barely housing a tiny cottage rented out from May to October for $15,000. \nAnd that’s a bargain, with larger properties ranging up to $40,000 a week. \nNaming boats and houses is a quaint tradition here with handsome quarterboards announcing such titles as, Hellza Poppin, Against the Wind, Just a Habit and Four is Enough. \nFirst-time visitors need to understand the island’s whaling history and the Nantucket Whaling Museum located in a former sperm whale processing factory tells the story in stunning fashion. Its collection includes a whale skeleton, meticulously carved scrimshaw pieces, and century-old handmade Nantucket lightboat baskets. \nA who’s who of America can often be spotted on the streets, including U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry whose wife’s family, the Heinzes, have long owned a summer home on the island. Nantucket native Meghan Trainor and her hit All About That Bass is a point of pride for islanders. And actor Ben Stiller, who spent his summers here, returns annually. \nDining highlights: We savoured Cape Cod oysters on the halfshell and swordfish at Dune Restaurant on one of Nantucket’s cobblestone streets. Arriving early for a must-have reservation at the Galley Beach restaurant, we combed the beautiful shoreline, before enjoying a seafood banquet, impeccably served during a breathtaking sunset. You get the picture. \nGalleries and shopping are also very upscale. After all R.H. Macy got his start here. But bargains are to be had at an historic home housing the hospital thrift shop, which was jammed with visitors discovering designer labels at great prices, aiding a good cause. \nMARTHA’S VINEYARD \nThe island where no wine-quality grapes actually grow, where Jaws was filmed 40 years ago, and where comedian John Belushi is buried is diverse and exciting. \nEdgartown is a community that is charm personified. We overnighted at the stylish Hob Knob Inn, the B&B where a windblown JFK slept in 1947 during a break in a regatta. \nThe harbour features one of the region’s oldest restored lighthouses. But Oak Bluff, where the ferry docks, is perhaps Martha Vineyard’s most interesting and eclectic town. \nFrom its waterfront party-scene arcades and bars, it’s a short walk to a historic Methodist campground. The enclave of brightly painted gingerbread summer homes, a National Historic Landmark, dates to the 1800s. The cottages circle a large, open air tabernacle where services have been held regularly since 1879. \nThis, of course, contrasts sharply with the nude beach on the other end of the island at Aquinnah, where the stunning ocean beach view from the hilltop Aquinnah Shop restaurant specializes in creative and tasty salads along with the expected delicious lobster rolls, clam chowder and crab cakes.
