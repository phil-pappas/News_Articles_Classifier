Art pieces will also explore issues around endemic and rare species, including human activities and the typical customs of each island.\nIn the presence of the Minister of Tourism and Culture Alain St. Ange, the CEO of the Seychelles Tourism Board Sherin Naiken, the artist George Camille, the head of the group Ars et Natura Alessandro Troisi, a delegation of Italian artists, the British artist Anne Shingleton, the Italian Consul Claudio Izzi, and other dignitaries and special guests, the exhibition will be inaugurated with a brief description of the project, which will be followed by the tasting of Italian wines and cheese.\nThe sponsors and organizers, Ars et Natura, Seychelles Art Projects Foundation, Arterial Network Seychelles, the Seychelles Tourism Board and Ethiopian Airlines will present the exhibition’s catalogue, a valuable illustrated book called “Seychelles – Ars et Natura’s project for the Archipelago’s Biodiversity” – PANDION & WILDART Studio publishers, which includes reproductions of more than 200 works created by the group of artists, with descriptive and scientific texts in English and French.

The exhibition will also display the works of the English artist Anne Shingleton, who has been living in Italy for many years and has now joined the Seychellois-Italian group.\nThanks to the organization and contribution of the Seychelles Tourism Board, 17 Italian artists visited and illustrated the natural wonders and the rich biodiversity of the tropical islands. A 15-day trip allowed the Italian artists to travel to the various islands, meet local artists, reside in important areas for the conservation of nature, starting from Cousin Island to the Valle de Mai, a UNESCO site, and thus represent all the natural species of flora and fauna, endemic areas and as well the city markets, museums and botanical gardens, and local festivals.
