We don't have to build hotels ourselves. We can attract investors to build it for us. So we are looking at reclaiming some areas in the front harbour of Nuku'alofa and so that will be most appropriate for some of the, say, 5 star hotels to be built.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T13:22:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
