The new infusion of capital was led by Pritzker Vlock Ventures and included Richard Branson of the Virgin Group.\nWith the new capital, it will continue its quest to become, in its words, the travel industry’s version of OpenTable, an online restaurant reservation company. Zozi essentially powers systems that let merchants, many of whom have not been truly connected to the Internet before, book reservations and payments online.\nIt also runs Zozi.com , an online market hub that lets consumers book travel activities, which are run by the company’s business customers.\nThough a number of other start-ups are trying to move into the back-end systems of the travel industry, Zozi’s co-founder and chief executive, T. J. Sassani, says the company is aiming to take on much bigger competitors, including TripAdvisor and Eventbrite.\nThough Zozi was initially known for helping consumers find ways to find unusual travel experiences, its move into booking and payment systems has changed its focus, according to Mr. Sassani.\nWith the new capital, the company intends to invest more money into developing its products and technology, as well as bringing more merchants onto its platform.\n“We want to own the booking platform, then capture the local market, and then we’ll capture the tourist,” he said.\nThat focus drew the attention of Mr. Branson, who met with the Zozi team at his resort on Necker Island in the Caribbean and participated in the round.\n“I’ve founded many companies that have disrupted markets over the years, and it’s clear to me that Zozi is leading a revolution with its innovative online booking software for activity businesses and consumer marketplace,” he said in a statement.\nLoading...
