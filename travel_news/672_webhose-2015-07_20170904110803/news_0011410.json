This always happens at the same times--the end of August and the first two weeks in January, just after the two major holiday periods of the year. At first glance, this seems odd. After all, we’re told that holidays are good for us, that a chance to get away with loved ones is not to be missed . Why, then, do so many people decide they need psychological help afterwards? A break from the hectic pace of life today is indeed a good idea . It allows us to rest, to enjoy new surroundings, and to gain perspective on our lifestyle and on the direction our life is taking. A break from the hectic pace of life today is indeed a good idea - EPA However, it’s easy to forget that any change—whether it’s a distressing change forced upon us, or a planned changed we’re looking forward to—is stressful. Humans are creatures of habit, and breaking habits takes a lot of effort. That’s why, at the start of a holiday individuals often feel anxious , and this feeling is likely to persist for three or four days, until they become used to their new circumstances. However, many people forget to allow time to adjust. Instead of giving themselves a chance to slow down, they register their immediate anxiety and start demanding an explanation, searching for something or someone to blame for their discomfort. Under such circumstances, it’s easy to make mistakes and to think in extremes. The problem, they may conclude, is the job they’re in or the people they live with. And of course, when they then look carefully at their job and their relationships, they will find faults, because no job or relationship is ideal. This only increases their anxiety, and minor irritations may be blown out of all proportion. A chance to get away with loved ones is not to be missed - AP Images Holidays can provide the perfect opportunity to think about your lifestyle and decide how you might live in a more fulfilling way. But the timing for such thinking is crucial if you want to enjoy your break, and at the same time to come home with some realistic ideas for positive change. Spend the first few days simply resting and enjoying your new surroundings. Then if you want to reflect on your lifestyle, feel free to do so. You’ll also have a more enjoyable holiday if in the planning stages, you choose a living space that’s as roomy as you can afford. Go for accommodation that allows each person a place, however small, where they can retreat to when they need a break from everyone else. Research suggests that when humans are put into more crowded conditions than they’re used to, particularly without access to a private space, they become more stressed. Finally, allow as much flexibility as possible in your day-to-day holiday timetable . The more freedom each person feels they have, the less arguments and resentment there will be during the holiday, and the more likely it is that everyone will return home feeling refreshed.
