(Photo: Presidio of San Francisco/Facebook ) \nA mountain lion has recently been seen roaming San Francisco, according to San Francisco Animal Control, Presidio Trust, and the National Park Service. \nThe groups announced yesterday that several wildcat sightings have been made, reportedly of the same animal. \nThe mountain lion was spotted four times and was last seen heading south near Lake Merced on July 3. Before then, it was seen in Sea Cliff and the Western Presidio on June 30 and then the 1000 block of Gough Street on July 1. In one of the instances, it was caught on tape by a surveillance camera meandering on a sidewalk. \nRelated: Has the Safari Experience Gone Too Far? \nSF Weekly reports this is the first time a mountain lion has roamed the city in many years. Fortunately, the large felines are said to instinctively avoid humans. \nMost of the sightings have been in San Mateo and Marin, which are more rural areas, Animal Control reports. \nHowever, if you happen to encounter the wild cat – either now or in the future – the Presidio Trust provided some useful advice: Maintain eye contact. Do not approach the Mountain Lion. Make noise. Do not turn your back or run. Appear as big and threatening as possible. Give the Mountain Lion room to run away. Do not corner it. \nIf the lion appears threatening: Pull children close to you and pick them up without crouching down. Throw rocks sticks, water bottles, backpacks, and any heavy objects available to you. Speak loudly and firmly. Wave your arms and clap your hands above your head. Fight back if attacked. Do not play dead or lie down. \nIf you need to report a sighting, contact San Francisco Animal Care and Control Emergency Dispatch at (415) 554-9400 or at 311. \nWATCH: Want to Have a Sleepover With Baby Cheetahs?
