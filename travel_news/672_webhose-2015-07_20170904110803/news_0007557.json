The 28-year-old, from Benxi city in the north-eastern province of Liaoning, had only been abroad once before. “I have a master’s degree from Aston University (in the West Midlands) and travelled a lot while I was in the UK.” Gao works for TBEA Xinjiang SunOasis Co, a Chinese company that completed the first energy project of the $46 billion (£30 billion) China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. The CPEC has been identified as a key part of the Belt and Road Initiative, which refers to the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road first proposed by President Xi Jinping in 2013. Under the initiative, China aims to support partner countries along the routes in developing infrastructure and improve its connectivity with Central Asia, the Middle East and Europe. Pakistan is the link between the belt and the road, and TBEA’s work in Pakistan has taken it to Bahawalpur, which is in the Punjab province. The former princely state was already home to royal palaces, historic forts and hundreds of archaeological sites, some dating back thousands of years to the Indus Valley Civilisation. The latest addition to the landscape was the Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park, a 6,498-acre site in the Cholistan desert named after the founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. TBEA built the world’s largest single solar photovoltaic power plant in three months. The 100-megawatt facility, which stretches across an area of 568 acres, had a total cost of $215 million and is the initial phase of the vast renewable energy project. The energy crisis has fuelled poverty, militancy and riots... The plant has already generated 39 million kilowatt-hours of energy for the Punjab, Hou Peng, TBEA’s director of international business, said in an interview with the Global Times, and it was connected to the grid in late March. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif inaugurated the plant on May 5. The country’s energy supplies have not met demand and power cuts have disrupted every aspect of daily life, including healthcare, manufacturing and education. They have deterred investors and damaged the economy, taking up to $9.2 billion off the country’s annual GDP. ... I can see huge potential in the energy market, and both governments are investing in this sector The energy crisis has fuelled poverty, militancy and riots that take the form of roadblocks, strikes and attacks on the homes of energy officials and utility offices. The Punjab is home to 55 per cent of Pakistan’s population and makes a 60-per cent contribution to the country’s GDP. It also consumes 68 per cent of the country’s energy. Addressing the energy crisis at a provincial level, let alone a national one, is a daunting task. Gao’s job involves project development and working on new opportunities, such as preparing tenders. The solar park has a 1.5-gigawatt capacity. I was in Karachi on the hottest day of the year, it was so humid and more than 1,000 people died... “I came to Pakistan for a training session, to learn about developing markets and projects, but after I started working here, the company’s management wanted me to stay for longer because of my language skills,” he said. “I accepted because I can see huge potential in the energy market, and both governments are investing in this sector.” Although Gao lived and worked in Lahore, he has travelled to Islamabad, the capital, and the metropolis of Karachi, which has an estimated population of 23 million. “I live in Defence (an upmarket neighbourhood), and at first I thought many people lived in lovely, big and modern houses. I’m a humble person, but I’m proud to take part in such big and great projects But then I learnt there are many more people who have bad living conditions,” he said. “Islamabad is like a bigger version of Defence, there are very few people living in a beautiful city. I was in Karachi on the hottest day of the year, it was so humid and more than 1,000 people died there because of a heat wave. The city was beyond anything I expected.” With Pakistan facing an energy crisis, he said TBEA was there to invest and establish power plants. “It’s a good market for us, and a good way to improve Pakistani living conditions and aid Pakistan’s development,” Gao said. “I’m a humble person, but I’m proud to take part in such big and great projects.” Background The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, as a flagship project of the Belt and Road Initiative, is a 1,860-mile corridor between southern Pakistan’s Gwadar Port and Kashgar, in north western China’s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. During President Xi Jinping’s visit to Pakistan in April, the two countries agreed to form a “1+4” co-operation structure, with the CPEC at the centre, and Gwadar Port, energy, transport infrastructure and industrial co-operation the four key areas to achieve common development. More than 30 agreements among the 51 agreements and memorandums of understanding worth £30 billion are designed to aid the CPEC project. Early results of the planned corridor have seen 25 projects scheduled for completion in the next three to five years. After signing 21 agreements on energy, the countries will co-operate on gas, coal and solar energy projects to provide 16,400 megawatts of electricity, roughly equivalent to Pakistan’s current capacity.
