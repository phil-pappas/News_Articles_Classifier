He has long touted the value of engagement and argued that the U.S. embargo on the communist island just 90 miles south of Florida was ineffective.\nObama and Secretary of State John Kerry are expected to speak Wednesday morning about the embassy openings. The official insisted on anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter ahead of the president.\n___\nFight for gay marriage turns now to clerks who defy Supreme Court, refuse marriage licenses\nMOREHEAD, Ky. — Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis shut her blinds at work Tuesday to block the view of rainbow-clad protesters outside. They carried flowers and flags and signs saying “you don’t own marriage.” They chanted “do your job.”\nMoments later, she told a lesbian couple who walked in asking for a license to try another county.\nDavis is among a handful of public officials across the Bible Belt so repulsed by the thought of enabling a same-sex marriage that they are defying the U.S. Supreme Court and refusing to issue a license to anyone, gay or straight.\n“It’s a deep-rooted conviction; my conscience won’t allow me to do that,” Davis told The Associated Press. “It goes against everything I hold dear, everything sacred in my life.”\nSome judges and clerks in Alabama and Texas have done the same, ordering their offices in the name of religious liberty and free speech to issue no marriage licenses at all.\n___\nJennifer Garner and Ben Affleck say they’ve decided to divorce after 10 years of marriage\nLOS ANGELES — Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner are splitting after 10 years of marriage.\nThe Oscar winner and his wife sent out a joint statement on Tuesday after weeks of public speculation on the status of their marriage.\n“After much thought and careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to divorce. We go forward with love and friendship for one another and a commitment to co-parenting our children whose privacy we ask to be respected during this difficult time,” the couple said.\nAffleck will continue to live on the couple’s property in a separate house and the two will continue to co-parent their three children: Violet Affleck, Seraphina Rose Elizabeth Affleck and Samuel Garner Affleck, according to a person who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The couple also plans to go to a mediator to settle their divorce, the person said.\n___\nChris Christie warns of blunt campaign in 2016 even if it makes people ‘cringe’\nLIVINGSTON, N.J. — A tough-talking New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie launched his 2016 campaign for president Tuesday with a promise to tell voters the truth even if it makes them cringe.\nThe Republican governor, a one-time GOP favorite who faded and now tries to climb back, lashed out at “bickering leaders” from both political parties in a kickoff rally in the gymnasium of his old high school. And in his trademark blunt style, he told voters — and warned Republican rivals — that he’s ready to be aggressive in the 2016 contest.\n“You’re going to get what I think whether you like it or not, or whether it makes you cringe every once in a while or not,” Christie declared. He added: “I am now ready to fight for the people of the United States of America.”\nChristie enters a Republican presidential field that already has more than a dozen GOP candidates. Not all draw as much attention as Christie, who will compete for the same slice of the electorate as pragmatic-minded White House hopefuls such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\nBut it’s an accomplished lineup of governors, senators and business people. Christie’s effort is largely driven by his outsized personality, and his resume, while notable, contains scattered land mines that have given many Republicans pause.\n___\nIn losing a battle at the Supreme Court, foes see ‘blueprint’ for defeating the death penalty\nATLANTA — A strongly worded dissent in the U.S. Supreme Court’s narrow decision this week upholding the use of an execution drug offered a glimmer of hope to death penalty opponents in what they considered otherwise a gloomy ruling. One advocate went so far Tuesday as to call it a blueprint for a fresh attack on the legality of capital punishment itself.\nBut even those who see Justice Stephen Breyer’s dissent as a silver lining think it will take time to mount a viable challenge.\nAnd Breyer’s words don’t change the fact that the Supreme Court has consistently upheld capital punishment for nearly four decades. The five justices forming the majority in Monday’s decision made it clear they feel that states must somehow be able to carry out the death penalty.\nIn disagreeing with the 5-4 ruling that approved Oklahoma’s use of an execution drug, Breyer, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, called it “highly likely that the death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment,” which protects against cruel and unusual punishment.\n“It was a sweeping and powerful dissent that issues an invitation that we should accept, which is to make the case for why today the death penalty itself is no longer constitutional,” said Cassandra Stubbs, director of the Capital Punishment Project of the American Civil Liberties Union.\n___\nSince 1981, GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush paid an average income tax rate of 36 percent\nDES MOINES, Iowa — Jeb Bush paid an average federal income tax rate of 36 percent over the past three decades.\nThat’s according to tax returns Bush posted online Tuesday. The records detail the Republican presidential candidate’s earnings and tax payments since 1981.\nBush notes that tax rate is higher than the 30 percent rate paid by Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2014.\nHe says on his website, “I have paid a higher tax rate than the Clintons even though I earned less income.”\nThe documents also detail Bush’s earnings over the eight years since he left office as Florida governor. He served on numerous corporate boards and saw his income rise sharply in that time.\n___\nDon’t blink: Tuesday lasts a second longer to make up for slightly slower Earth rotation\nTuesday lasts a wee bit longer — by a second.\nInternational timekeepers are tacking a second to the clock to compensate for a slightly slower Earth rotation.\nWhile a leap second is hardly enough time to change daily life, it has been known to affect some computer systems in the past.\nThere have been calls to abandon the practice of periodically adding an extra second, which has kept computers synchronized with the Earth day since 1972. The last time was in 2012.\nA decision by a United Nations agency that deals with telecommunications issues isn’t expected until later this year at the earliest.\n___\nTrump’s beauty pageant woes mount with more TV drop-outs over his remarks about immigrants\nNEW YORK — Fallout from Donald Trump’s remarks about immigrants from Mexico continued to dog him Tuesday as a TV company backed by Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim said it was scrapping a project in development with the outspoken mogul, and Mexico announced it won’t be sending a contestant to the Miss Universe contest, which Trump partly owns.\nMeanwhile, the backlash threatened to extend beyond Trump’s media interests.\nOra TV became the latest company to cut ties with Trump over remarks he made in his recent presidential campaign kickoff speech, when he declared that some Mexican immigrants bring drugs and crime to the U.S. and are rapists.\nThe company did not give any details about the project it had been developing with Trump. Slim holds a majority interest in Ora TV, which produces shows including “Larry King Now” and “Off the Grid with Jesse Ventura.”\nAnd a day after Televisa, the Mexican TV network that airs Miss Universe, said there would be no telecast for the next contest, Miss Mexico pageant director Lupita Jones said Mexico would boycott Miss Universe She said Trump damaged the pageant and its tradition of convening countries for an event that showcases “friendship, unity and breaking down cultural barriers.”\n___\nOfficial: Prison chief, 11 others placed on leave in aftermath of escape by 2 killers\nALBANY, N.Y. — The superintendent at the prison where two killers broke out has been placed on leave along with his security chief and 10 other staff members amid an internal investigation into how the inmates pulled it off, a state official said Tuesday.\nThe 12-member group is in addition to the guard and the prison tailor shop instructor who have been arrested on charges they helped the escapees.\nOfficials would not say what connection, if any, the 12 had to the June 6 escape from the maximum-security prison or the failure to prevent it.\nMeanwhile, the surviving convict, David Sweat, claimed from his hospital bed that he used no power tools to cut his way out, contrary to what authorities have said.\nSweat was wounded and captured Sunday near the Canadian border after three weeks on the run. His accomplice, Richard Matt, was shot to death last week.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
