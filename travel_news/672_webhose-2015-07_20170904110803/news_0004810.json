(Jim Judkis/For The Washington Post) By Maura Judkis July 16 at 7:16 PM Follow @MauraJudkis P ittsburgh, the city that birthed America’s most famous condiment — Heinz ketchup — is perhaps best known culinarily for enhancing dishes with french fries. Fries on sandwiches . Fries on salads . And until recently, the city’s food scene had a similarly unsophisticated reputation. Those guilty pleasures are still abundant on Pittsburgh menus, but in recent years, they’ve been surpassed by such refined fare as squid-ink gnudi, duck-confit tacos, and aviation cocktails made with local gin.\nPittsburgh’s restaurant scene has grown up, and food tourists are beginning to notice.\n“When I moved to Pittsburgh , half of the things I enjoyed on a regular basis” — Negronis, Fernet-Branca liqueur, brut rosé — “no one even knew what they were,” said Justin Severino, a 2015 James Beard Award semifinalist for best chef in the Mid-Atlantic. Even worse, back in 2007 his fine-dining training in California didn’t help him get a job at what he recalls as a fusty lineup of unimaginative American restaurants. “I really felt like I’d made the worst decision of my life,” he said. “My résumé meant nothing to a chef in Pittsburgh.”\nYou’d be hard-pressed to find a chef who wouldn’t want to work with Severino now. But he works for himself instead, as the chef-owner of Cure , an upscale, whole-animal, Mediterranean-inspired restaurant in a newly trendy neighborhood. Cure is a mecca for carnivores; the shareable salumi plate alone comes with no fewer than 17 types of cold meats, including lamb culatello, coppa di testa and duck rillettes.\nThe Charcroute, a family-style dish served at Cure in Pittsburgh's foodie Lawrenceville neighborhood, includes six types of meat such as boudin blanc, pork tenderloin and trotter croquette. (Maura Judkis/The Washington Post) Severino is a good example of the major shift that has happened in Pittsburgh: Given the bargain rent and low cost of living, chefs around the city have struck out on their own — and they’ve given the dining scene a whole new flavor.\nNewly hip home town I grew up in Pittsburgh’s hilly suburbs, happily eating special-occasion dinners at white-tablecloth restaurants that, in retrospect, seem to have been preserved in amber. But in recent years, I began to hear rumblings about upscale farm-to-table eateries and trendy fusion places. Twelve-dollar cocktails were being mixed on the same streets where ancient dive bars sold Iron City for $1.75. Bon Appetit’s Foodist column named it the next big food town in 2014. My home town became cool when I wasn’t watching.\nSo on a recent trip to visit my family, I reacquainted myself with Pittsburgh, where the most famous restaurant is probably still Primanti Brothers, purveyor of the aforementioned belly-busting french-fry-filled sandwich. Best enjoyed at the chain’s flagship, in the Strip District — nothing unseemly here; the neighborhood is named for the stretch of land it sits on along the Allegheny River — the sandwich, invented for truck drivers, is a lowbrow and delicious reminder of the city’s blue-collar roots.\nThe sculpture “Point of View,” of Seneca leader Guyasuta, left, meeting George Washington, overlooks downtown Pittsburgh's “Golden Triangle,” where the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers meet to form the Ohio. (Jim Judkis/For The Washington Post) So, too, is the pierogi, a stalwart of the city’s Polish community. But now those humble dumplings have become a symbol of Pittsburgh’s past and future. You’ll find them in such places as downtown deli Szmidt’s , where the pierogi are done “Old World” (potato and cheddar) and “New World” (buffalo bleu cheese, among others); or at Ohio City Pasta in the Pittsburgh Public Market, where a heaping plate of breakfast potato-cheddar pierogi comes topped with a runny egg, bacon, avocado, sauteed leeks, tomato and herb butter sauce.\n“I think the best chefs are trying to retain a little bit of that hometown flavor and elevate it,” said Melanie Cox McCluskey, the managing editor of Pop City , a local news and culture blog.\nThe Strip is a longtime venue for food wholesalers, where sidewalk vendors advertise fried fish and two-pound pepperoni rolls. Older establishments skew Italian, like the charming Enrico Biscotti and La Prima Espresso . But the newer spots introduce duck-fat-fried hash browns and egg-topped Belgian waffles ( Second Breakfast , in the Pittsburgh Public Market ), and craft cocktails customized according to guests’ whims ( Bar Marco , where tipping has been abolished — a growing trend).\nOn a busy Saturday morning, customers jam the cheese counter of the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company while the window reflects the bustling Penn Avenue crowds. (Jim Judkis/For The Washington Post) Pittsburgh is proudly a meat-and-potatoes town — and it’s a beer and whiskey city, too, and you’ll find both being produced in abundance.
