How does NZ life compare to abroad? Share your stories, photos and videos. \nIf anyone needs to take a look at how their culture is serving them - it's us. \nHere are four things Americans are nailing that Kiwis are not: \nPOSITIVITY \nThe positivity and passion of the American people I encountered was infectious. Where Kiwis have perfected \"laid back and chilled\" to personify happiness, American's have mastered in-your-face friendliness in a way that actually challenged me. \nI met Abraham from Santa Monica in an UberX pool. My Kiwi mindset had me questioning what he wanted but he was just a happy dude hastening to tell me his life story. \nHe had good reason to be happy. Despite his low income, a city rent freeze meant he could still afford to live in his apartment in beachfront Santa Monica. His neighbour pays thousands for the privilege. He works six days a week and didn't take holidays but when I told him most Kiwis get a minimum of four weeks leave he didn't waste time being envious. He told jokes and then explained them, he asked whether New Zealand used the euro or the pound and espoused the virtues of In&Out Burger. \nI am convinced that if a Kiwi was in that cab we would have had a slightly awkward interaction trying to find the seatbelt clicker and then one or both of us would have picked up the phone and complained to a friend about the traffic. Ad Feedback \nPATRIOTISM \nBefore I got to my Airbnb in LA I counted more than 10 American flags proudly flying outside homes. This was one of the biggest cultural oddities for me. I mean fancy buying a flag and flying it on your front lawn. \nThe Fourth of July only enhanced the flag waving, but it wasn't the \"'Merica f*** yeah\" attitude I expected, or anything like the sea of drunken revellers I happily raged with on Australia Day last year. It was a genuine celebration of citizenship. A parade of kids and dogs (both in strollers), local council people and families all dressed up. \nBack home I see the opportunity to better embrace civics is being squandered by political point scoring and read-easy headlines about how we ought to \"flag the flag debate\". I think debating who we are and what we stand for – or under – holds great value for a young country struggling to keep up with its changing face and culture. \nPOLITENESS \nSomewhere between Auckland and Invercargill saying \"please\" and \"thank you\" has fallen off the radar. \nSome might say service staff are chasing the tourist tip in the US, but the manners of the people I met meant more than that (and everyone knows Kiwis are awful tippers). \nAt an ice cream parlour in Santa Cruz a little girl pushed in front of my friend and I while in line for the water cooler. Her mother, appalled, got up immediately and insisted she look us in the eye and apologise, a scene more culturally awkward for us than it was for this parched child. \nOn another occasion, as we headed toward a restroom on the Boardwalk, we were intercepted not once, but three times to be told they were out of order. It sounds like a stupid account of courtesy, but I am convinced back home there would have been a huddle of Kiwis each trying the door and failing, each frustrated but no one acknowledging it and no one alerting anyone else to their misfortune. \nI plan to stop texting at counters and throw a \"have a nice day in\" next time I'm at New World. \nPOLITICAL ENGAGEMENT \nThis one I felt most of all. Whether it was chatting to a hiker in Yosemite National Park, a tour bus driver or watching locals greet their councillors in the street, overt political engagement was clear. \nYour education, your job or your political leanings didn't matter a jot. Your opinion was valid and treated as such. It felt healthy. It felt inclusive and progressive. \nThe American people do democracy well. They throw more money at it than we do and vested interests get tangled up in that process – but hey – that happens back home and what's more dangerous is that nobody is engaged enough to care. \nKiwi politicians are leveraging our apathy to advance their agendas. It's making politics uglier than it needs to be and its fuelling a barrage of stupid questions from jumped-up journalists chasing clicks. \nWe'd all be better off for caring a bit more. \nOr as the Hiphopopotamus and the Rhymenoceros, two of our best exports to the USA so wisely said; \"What? Why exactly? What? Why? Be more constructive with your feedback, please\". \nSarah Austen-Smith is studying for a Master in Journalism at Massey University. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T05:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T11:13:57.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
