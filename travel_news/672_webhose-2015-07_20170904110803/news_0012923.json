What makes it extraordinary? Besides an elegant design and more than 20,000 square feet of flexible meeting and events space suitable for groups of 50 to 720 attendees, the inclusion of onsite overnight accommodations for up to 200 attendees makes the venue ideal for hosting a variety of overnight unique events. Unlike any other facility, IPEC’s overnight accommodations are available exclusively to guests booking an event. \nIPEC welcomes corporate meetings, association conferences, education events, training seminars or any event when an immersive, focused atmosphere is desired. Meanwhile, its stylish 5,000-square-foot front foyer, with high 29-foot-high ceilings, and expansive 10,000-square-foot ballroom make it a perfect venue for weddings, reunions, birthday and anniversary parties—or any other occasion when a stunning backdrop is in order. “In developing IPEC, we envisioned a venue geared especially for education and training, meetings and special-occasion events,” explains Michael Fiorentino, asset manager, IPEC. “Las Vegas is the meetings capital of the world, and IPEC allows planners and attendees the best of all worlds—a self-contained, tranquil atmosphere free of distractions and conducive to the greatest productivity, yet close enough to the Strip and all it has to offer for off-site excursions. Plus, there’s no other freestanding events venue in Las Vegas, or anywhere else, that offers onsite guestrooms exclusively to meetings attendees.” For meetings, IPEC offers six conference rooms with capacities of 22 to 61 for lecture-style seating and 28 to 79 for theatre-style seating, as well as one multipurpose room with a capacity of up to 72 for lecture-style seating and 96 for theatre-style seating. Onsite services available include 2 large, customisable LED screens, including one 22-foot-high screen in the foyer and one 22-foot-wide screen in the south lobby; state-of-the-art audio/visual, wireless and production services; a 2,500-square-foot kitchen with customizable food and beverage service available 24/7; an expansive registration area; business center services; 24/7 security and onsite parking for 200 vehicles. Of its 49 onsite overnight rooms, 46 have two queen beds, a bathroom, desk and sitting area. Two one-bedroom accommodations have a master bath, living room and wet bar, while one four-bedroom accommodation offers three baths, a living room, dining room and kitchen—perfect for an executive retreat, VIP speaker green room or bridal party suite. Each room also includes a fully stocked mini bar. To help planners produce the most memorable and crowd-pleasing events possible, IPEC is proud to partner with AWG Destination Management Services, Metropolitan Exhibition Services, Inc., and Hospitality Performance Network (HPN). Together with these industry leaders, IPEC plans to ensure every meeting, event and is a seamless and extraordinary experience, from start to finish.
