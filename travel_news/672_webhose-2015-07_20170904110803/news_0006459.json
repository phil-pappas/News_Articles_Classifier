L’Etape Australia will take place in Thredbo, Perisher and Jindabyne in December next year and is expected to attract up to 7,000 cyclists.\nMinister for Trade, Tourism and Major Events and Minister for Sport Stuart Ayres said the event has been secured through Destination NSW for the next three years.\n“Cycling tourism is an expanding market delivering important economic, social and environmental benefits to our tourism industry. A high-profile event such as L’Etape Australia is anticipated to deliver in excess of $4 million in visitor expenditure across the three years,” Mr Ayres said.\n“Not only do events like L’Etape Australia provide valuable support to local communities within Regional NSW, but it helps the NSW Government achieve its goal of doubling overnight visitor expenditure to the State by 2020.”\nL’Etape Australia will run over three days and include a course endorsed by the Le Tour de France Race Director, Christian Prudhomme. The event will encompass different levels including a highly challenging mountainous route, a course for seasoned riders and a shorter ride for those wanting to absorb the atmosphere of a weekend immersed in Le Tour de France. L’Etape Australia will be co-managed by Lateral Events and SBS and promoted by SBS.\n“SBS is the home of cycling in Australia and for over two decades we have championed a sport which transcends cultural barriers and unites communities with a shared passion,” said SBS Managing Director Michael Ebeid.\n“We’re proud our long-standing relationship with Le Tour de France has played a part in bringing to life this opportunity for the world’s most iconic cycling brand to come to NSW.”\nMember for Monaro John Barilaro said competitors would be able to enjoy the area’s endless mountainous terrain making it the perfect spot for this Australian-first event.\n“During the warmer months, the Snowy Mountains transform into a cyclist’s dream and we are excited to welcome competitors and spectators to the region next year and showcase all that the region has to offer,” Mr Barilaro said.\nDates for L’Etape Australia 2016 will be announced once the review of the course and race logistics have been approved by the relevant NSW Government authorities.\nSource:- Destination NSW\nRelated Posts Chelsea Football Club Hosts Leaders Sport Summit 2013, the world’s most Prestigious Sport Business Summit Destination NSW Regional Manager UK And Germany Appointed Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour returns with Aida Innovative tourism operators secure funding World Premiere of NSW production Ruben Guthrie to open Sydney Film Festival", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T20:12:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
