The company now handles around 50pc of online postcode look-ups in the UK and the service is used by more 10,000 companies and organisations around the world, from Tesco to Oxfam. However, when it started the company was known as Postcode Anywhere and was on a different trajectory. Two years ago Guy Mucklow and his co-founder Jamie Turner realised there was a gap in the market for a real-time analytics tool. Mr Mucklow says: “We started to build a tool we could use within our own business to monitor our customers’ happiness. Using this tool our team can spot when a customer is having a problem (accounting issues or a website error for example) and this triggers an alert for someone to jump in to retain that customer. ”This gradually evolved into Triggar, a big-data platform which takes statistical patterns from online behaviour to predict the likelihood of a website visitor successfully completing a journey. This is currently in the beta stage, but, says Mr Mucklow, “we expect it to be responsible for half of our revenues in the next five years.” We were able to use our ready-made audiences to promote our new venture A change like this has to be managed properly. Mr Mucklow says: “We put in place a number of key building blocks, ranging from spending more than £2m on a new headquarters in Worcester, to strengthening our systems and processes so that everyone in the business has a very clear idea of what we are doing.” The company also moved to an employee ownership model. Pink Spaghetti began as a lifestyle management company, helping busy people with home-based jobs such as booking holidays and cleaning. But founder Vicky Matthews explains: “After about 18 months we realised our customers were asking us for help with their small businesses. It grew to the point we realised it was a more viable business model.” So the company moved away from the home-help idea and now offers more focused business support. The move, Ms Matthews says, enabled the company to use social media in a more directed way. “We send email newsletters and targeted business-focused tips. Our messages have changed.” Since this decision, Ms Matthews says the company’s growth figures changed “hugely”. “Our profitability soared,” she says, and three years ago she began franchising the business. It now has 11 franchisees and three people working in its Cheshire office, where it operates as a franchisee. Louise Davies founded Seventeen Events Ltd in 2005, to deliver sustainable events for corporates, public sector and charities. But after feeling despondent after the 2012 Olympics that businesses just weren't taking sustainability seriously, she and her husband set up Eighteen Rabbit Fair Trade, selling fair trade products online and from its Hay-on-Wye location. The couple developed a new proposition, wrote a new business plan and recruited new retail staff. Ms Davies says: “The hard thing was turning away new events business, but we knew we had to focus 100pc on the new direction. We were able to use our ready-made audience of Twitter followers and mailing lists to promote our new venture.” In tech, at least, says Mr Mucklow, “the danger point comes when you stop innovating and start trying to protect what you already have. Many tech businesses grow to a certain stage, start panicking about competitors and get litigious. ‘’They stop looking forward at the new things they could do and start looking backwards at what competitors are doing and how to protect what they have already done. Instead you ruthlessly innovate by trying a few crazy things.” See how technology is helping to transform other businesses at HP BusinessNow You may also be interested in: • Efficient doctors need IT prescription • Earwig expands its schools curriculum • What is lean start-up philosophy? • Consider it signed, sealed and sent with Sendy • Gaming and gambling: a new cocktail from Geonomics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T16:29:03.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
