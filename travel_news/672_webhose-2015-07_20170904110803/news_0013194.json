You can’t be more correct. Except in this case, the real thing might just be better than what you have imagined. \n\nThe Garland of the Gods \n\nThe country’s name has its roots in the Sanskrit words Mala meaning flower garland and Dvipa meaning islands. An exquisitely apt name, for garlands were extravagant necklaces made of flowers offered only to the revered deities and saintly figures. Today, Maladvipa, as it was once known to the ancient world, holds secrets that are worthy for the pleasure of the gods. \n\nSituated southwest of Sri Lanka and India in the Laccadive Sea, Maldives is an island country made up of twenty-six coral atolls that hosts the most enjoyable sights and activities on its islands –from lounging around in your own luxurious suite-on-stilts, swimming with live manta rays and sharks, to surfing, windsurfing and kitesurfing on its magnificent crystal waters. Launch all these memorable pastimes from a beach resort in Maldives and hop your way around the islands and take in everything this spectacular archipelago has to offer. \n\nBathe, Dive, Surf and Laze \n\nTaking to the islands on the different atolls tops the list of things to do in the Maldives. Get to them via seaplane or boat and let powdery white sand shores lead you to its pristine beaches. Calmer waters around the atolls boasts of arranged fishing trips that lets you leave with not just memories but a catch you can take home for dinner after a hard day’s work of lounging around. \n\nSail around to get to Maldives reefs –Maldives’s best scuba sites where visibility underwater reaches up to twenty meters out! Have an exhilarating dive with moray eels, sharks, rays, giant clams. Ride out further to sea and be met by dolphins eager to show humans a trick or two. \n\nThough the Maldives has been known more for its calmer waters, surf season which rolls through mid-February to November, though less known than other popular surf destinations in the world, may be one of the most consistent swell producers. Wind surfers and kite-surfers will surely get their fix around Maldives’s surf destinations. \n\nExperience Maldives and discover how real life can be better than fantasy. ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T01:44:15.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
