This area — which is surrounded by snowcapped peaks, but never freezes — is absolutely stunning! \nThe Ala-Too mountain range, the border between Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, was on one side and on the other, the amazingly blue Issyk-Kol, with bluish-grey mountains, blue skies, white peaks and clouds in the far distance. \nThis gradually changed on the south side of the lake. Issyk-Kol was still incredibly beautiful but the landscape was much more varied. At times it was lush and green and then it would be totally barren and red or yellow or brown. Some parts even reminded me of other countries. \nBetween the villages of Tamga and Bokonbayevo, south of the lake, I ventured off-road and had my first encounter with \"machine made\" roads; roads covered with little pieces of ground stone, of which many were to follow. Plus, there finally was some serious elevation — it was good preparation for the Dolon Pass at 3,030m above sea level. \nBut the locals told me that was not an option. It was unclear why. This meant I had to change my plan and go up to Song-Kol via the Kalmak Ashu (\"ashu\" means pass), 3,446m and down via the Tridzat Tri Popugai Pass, 3,133m. \nIt would only be an extra day, I thought. But in the mountains the weather can change from one moment to the next, which, unfortunately, it did. It started to rain and then the rain froze; hail! In Tolok, a village at that point just visible in the distance, I found shelter and stayed overnight with Asel, the local English teacher, and her three children. \nUp at Song-Kol, at the jailoos (summer pastures), I finally got to use my borrowed tent. In Karakol I had bought an extra sleeping bag in anticipation of the cold. One sleeping bag liner plus two sleeping bags and a few extra socks did the trick! Even though \"my\" red tent had turned white overnight, I had not felt any cold. \nHere I also encountered the first of only a few travellers. A German couple on motorbikes on their way back to Germany from Singapore. But what was even more exciting, for the first time in my life I stood eye-to-eye with yaks. Magnificent animals; absolutely impressive and much bigger and hairier than I had expected. \nI continued onto the Tridzat Tri Popugai Pass, 3,133m, which turned out to be the most beautiful of all the passes I saw on the trip. \nUnfortunately, it had awfully steep switchbacks with very short turns, so the downhill was unrideable for me. So saddle down, hands on the breaks and throw down the feet for extra \"break-power\". \nFrom Naryn I biked on to the next challenge: the Kurtkal Pass, 3,660m. Yet again, the rain forced me to adjust my plan and seek shelter. There were no yurts in sight and most farms were not yet occupied as the shepherds had only just started going up to the jailoos. \nThen during the fourth shower, which was getting progressively worse, I saw a small farm and movement. Before I even uttered a word, Ai Cholpon's grandmother had already ushered me indoors, sat me down in front of the stove, started making tea and brought out bread and jam. After that, she added some extra blankets and cushions to the floor of the shared bedroom; I could stay for the night. \nThe next day at the bottom of the switchbacks I encountered a Dutch Adventure Team in jeeps, on their way to Beijing from Amsterdam. After having agreed that \"Dutch people are everywhere!\", I continued onto the highest pass of the trip, leading back to Song-Kol. \nI spent two days at the south shore of Song-Kol with the local shepherd and his family, admiring the lake, surrounding mountains and animals, learning Kyrgyzs from Agaghan, a nine-year-old boy, sharing dates and nuts plus mango with sugar/salt/chilli (and some other snacks) I brought from Thailand and being treated to tea and bread with home-made jam, three times a day and even dinner (unless you have your tent closed!). \nThe downhill via the Kara Keche Pass, 3,364m, was next. A more gradual downhill, where at some point the landscape turned a new colour: black, due to the coal dust from the mines. \nThe final pass was the Tuz Ashu, 3,586m, with a tunnel starting at the top. So my final descent started in the semi-dark. Having arrived in Sosnovka, I had one last day on the road, further downhill, back to Bishkek. \nIt was an absolutely fabulous trip of just under 1,350km in one month. The scenery in Kyrgyzstan is very varied and breathtakingly beautiful, the local people are extremely friendly and very hospitable — I have not been able to keep count the times they helped me out (often without asking): offering me advice, accommodation, meals and most of all, warm tea with bread and home-made jam. \nGo and visit if you have the opportunity, you won't regret it!
