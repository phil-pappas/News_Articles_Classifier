Enter Downtown Partners Chicago , an enterprising ad agency that has come up with a high-energy new TV, radio and out-of-home campaign for the Adler that distills the Planetarium's allure into one succinct theme line — \"Space is freaking awesome.\" Yes, it's a line that will surely resonate with today's culture thanks in large measure to the use of that currently hugely popular term \"awesome.\" But in this instance, the subject (space) and descriptive (awesome) are perfectly in synch. Because what else is there that we know of that is truly more awesome than outer space. In any event, Downtown Partners has created two new 15-second TV commercials — each of which offers tantalizing tidbits about what make outer space such a fascinating, uh, region to explore. Using simple but catchy animation, one spot talks of a planet in our galaxy that rains glass and tries to suggest Chicago, with its often miserable weather, has it easy by comparison. Maybe, but . . . Another spot explains — in lively visual and verbal fashion — what that mysterious red spot on planet Jupiter is really all about. As both commercials make apparent, the Adler is a place where visitors can be both entertained and educated. Now that is a simply freaking awesome combination. \nWant Chicago Education news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
