To put that figure into perspective, the city's population is 7,235,043. \nHong Kong Book Fair in 2014. Photo Credit: Accidental Travel Writer. Hong Kong Book Fair 2010 2012 2013 2014 \nMore than 1 million bibliophiles attended last year's Hong Kong Book Fair, with spending up fully 25%! An even larger crowd is expected this year. \nTo paraphrase Mark Twain, news of the death of books has been greatly exaggerated. At least that is what the massive attendance figures at Hong Kong's annual Book Fair seems to suggest. \nAt a time when bricks and mortar bookshops are closing their doors right and left - and when more and more bibliophiles are switching from paper to digital formats - the strong attendance is a bit surprising. \nDespite inclimate weather, last year's event attracted a record-breaking crowd of 1.1 million attendees. Will even more people attend this year's event? \n\"The enduring success of the Hong Kong Book Fair is a sure sign of Hong Kong people’s thirst for knowledge and appetite for a good story,\" says Benjamin Chau, Deputy Executive Director of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council. \n\"The Book Fair has become a not-to-be-missed summer event for the public and for the industry.” \nAn estimated 120,000 of last year's 1.01 million attendees, or 12%, were not from Hong Kong, with most of them coming from China, Macau, and Taiwan. But there were also a signficant number coming from Britain, Korea, Singapore, the United States, and other places. \nFully one-half of the non-resident attendees said that attending the book fair was their primarily reason for visiting Hong Kong. The main reason for attending the fair was to buy books that were not available at home. \nBook Fair Tips \nThe crowds will amaze you!
