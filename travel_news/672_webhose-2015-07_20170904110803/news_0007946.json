The information in this article will help you plan the perfect getaway. \nLeave what valuables you can at home and don’t take them on your trip. The more valuables you bring with you, the more chance you have of losing one or more of them or possibly having them stolen. \nLearn about the place you are traveling to. Buy a map of the area in which you are visiting, learn about the environment, and find tourist attractions. Having   how the area you’re going to is laid out, will make it much easier to get around when you arrive. \nMake sure you are careful about any food allergies you may have whenever you visit a foreign land. You need to know the language’s food related words, particularly if you have bad reactions to foods. This will enable you to tell your staff about your allergies and in times of emergency, you will be able to tell medical professionals about your condition. \nPrior to making a reservation, do your research. Find websites that contain reviews of potential destinations. Get advice from friends who may have traveled there previously. Doing some research will make you more aware of what can be expected, and will also help you decide what activities to do once you are there. \nIncrease safety at hotels by bringing along a door stop. Sometimes, especially in areas of higher crime such as developing countries, you may want a little extra security for your hotel room. If there’s no deadbolt or chain behind the door, put a small, wedge doorstop under the room door before you go to bed. \nAlways be kind, and tip your bell waiter and housekeeper daily. This will make your stay much more pleasant. A good rule of thumb is $1 per bag/luggage and about $2-5 a day for housekeeping. Tipping ensures good service and is sure to make your interactions with hotel staff more pleasurable. \nWhen you get into your hotel room, check your alarm. The worst thing that could happen is to be startled by an alarm clock when you’re fast asleep that a previous guest had set to early. Make sure you check the alarm clock and make sure it’s set for a time that is good for you;, otherwise, you might find yourself off to a terrible start on your vacation. \nWhen out and about on vacation, bring the hotel’s business card (or something with their name on it) with you. If you are on the streets in a strange city and become lost, this will be quite useful when getting directions from the locals or a taxi driver. This is very useful if you do not know the language well. \nFor your morning coffee, melt ice overnight. Ice water frequently tastes better than tap water, so fill up your ice bucket so it can melt as you sleep. When you get up the next day, you will have great-tasting water for your brew. \nGet involved with travel websites and forums. You can learn a lot from fellow travelers. You will meet new people, share experiences and keep from making the mistakes others have made. \nWhen traveling by car or airplane with a small child, make sure you have plenty of interesting things to occupy them during the trip. Remember to bring favorite toys. It’s a good idea to buy something new, so that it will be sure to keep the attention of your little one for a long period. \nCash in traveler’s checks before shopping or eating. While most places do accept traveler’s checks, they can be difficult to deal with. If you use them, you may find that you get shorted, so convert them to local currency before you shop. \nIf you have to leave a car at the airport, make sure to book your parking ahead of time. Booking parking the same day as your flight is more expensive. Make sure, though, to compare the cost of long-term parking to the cost of taking a cab to the airport. \nCar rental agencies require renters to be 18 years old. Now there are some companies where the age requirement to rent is 25 or older. Chances are a rental agency will charge an under 25 driver a higher rate, and also a credit is needed. Some cities don’t allow for the renting of cars to seniors. Inquire about age limits when renting a car. \nWhen you are traveling, it is important to remember to be aware of your vital belongings at all times. If you carry a purse, you want to make sure that it is tucked under your arm securely. If it has a long enough strap, you should have the strap crossing your body. Also, pick travel bags with secured flaps that conceal zippers and pockets, so that access is not easy in crowded or dangerous areas. You should keep these things in mind when trying to find a travel bag that will be reliable for you. \nIf you’re going on a road trip with your small child, make sure you take a break every couple hours or so. Breaks give you the chance to stretch your limbs and visit the bathroom. You’ll also prevent kids from getting motion sickness this way. Your trip may take longer, but reducing the stress can be worth that delay. \nTraveling near or far can be fun if you use the information from this article. You can make use of all the information you learned here and have the best times of your life.
