The campaign will include three government dinners, an up-weighted social media campaign and a month of events during National Events Month October, #NEMO. \nSpeaking at the show was Alistair Turner, Campaign Director of Britain for Events and Kevin Jackson, Vice President EMEA, George P Johnson and President Elect of the International Special Event Society (ISES). Last month the campaign announced the return of #NEMO following its amazing success last year. The campaign will also receive high level and influential support from industry associations including the AEO, HBAA, ISES, MIA, NOEA and the BVEP, as well as commercial partners including Cvent, Venuefinder.com, International Confex and George P Johnson. Representing the partners of the campaign, Kevin Jackson from George P Johnson commented, “This is a campaign that takes important messages from our sector and delivers them to business and government in an independent, serious, yet playful way. There can be no doubt that the events industry is growing in importance and on an upward curve. I’ve seen first-hand how we need this campaign whose sole objective is to grow the cake for the industry and everyone in it.” The response from event organisers around the UK – and many overseas – has been outstanding. From a standing start last year Britain for Events grew its social media platforms universally through #NEMO. On twitter alone the campaign picked up nearly 3,000 followers and is expecting that number to double in October 15. “Event organisers love the campaign; they love it because it represents them,” commented Alistair Turner. “First and foremost we’re there to grow investment in events, to encourage business to use events as a vital part of their sales, marketing, corporate communications, or HR activity. But events professionals also love it because it works hard to understand them and fight for the things that make their lives easier.“ The Britain for Events campaign runs throughout the year, supporting activities that help raise awareness of the issues event organisers have, with the aim of making the UK an internationally competitive destination for events. This is through government, but also direct with business, working with UKTI, BIS and other business communities from the CBI to the CIM. “Last year the campaign hit over 1m consumers of events, talked to over 250K businesses and provided forums between business, government and the events industry to share ideas and work together for mutual growth,” continued Turner. “This year it will do it again; we’re planning three receptions with the Conrad London St James, where government and business representatives can meet senior figures within the industry.” Equally, #NEMO is filling up with the MIA supporting the # during its 25th Anniversary activity, the HBAA running a series of coordinated and simultaneous events up and down the country, and the AEO using the campaign to represent the UK market in meetings in Europe and the Far East. “This is an exciting time for the events industry, events are moving upwards in the marketing mix, businesses are seeing its value and the industry has never had so much government support,” concluded Turner. “We couldn’t do it without the support of our partners, but now the campaign needs to strive for more, and to take the next step forward.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T11:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T11:54:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
