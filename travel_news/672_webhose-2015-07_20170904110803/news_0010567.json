A 35-year-old woman was treated and released Monday night, Gregg said.\nIn addition, a girl and boy were taken to Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett with minor injuries and have been released, according to Colleen Wadden, a Providence spokeswoman.\nLewis Kamb: lkamb@seattletimes.com or (206) 464-2932.
