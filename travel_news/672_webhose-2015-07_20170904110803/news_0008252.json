A short stopover at Hyderabad...The City of Nawabs and Kebabs! # 1 Have you ever been hallucinated with narrow lanes thronged with markets; leaving barely any place to walk ? Overcrowded Tea (chai) shops and Loud and colorful auto rickshaws amidst timeworn yet imperial architecture in varying states of renovation ? Well... welcome to Hyderabad... The land of Nawabs and Kebabs!!! A visit to Hyderabad happened out of a chance. The city, known for its rich cultural heritage and its love for Mughal dishes, had fascinated my attention for a long time and a personal meeting request from a relative had set up my date with Hyderabad... The city of Biriyani.. Kebabs.. Nawabs and mesmerizing cultural inheritance!!! The city of smiles, lights, and a thousand faces is endearingly called as the Pearl City. The Charminar by Abhishek Sanyal Hyderabad is now the capital of the southern Indian state of Telangana. It lies along the banks of the Musi River and is spread over 922 square kilometers Hyderabad was established in 1591, by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, and was under the rule of the Qutb Shahi dynasty for about a century, before falling into the hands of the Mughals. Close to 1724, Mughal viceroy Asif Jah I declared his independence and created his own dynasty, known as the Nizams of Hyderabad. The name Hyderabad means \"Hyder's abode\" or \"lion city\", derived from the Persian/Urdu words Haider (lion) and ābād (city or abode) How to Reach Hyderabad Hyderabad is well connected to all major metro cities by air and rail. Accommodation in Hyderabad Accommodation in Hyderabad is certainly not an issue as the city has an abundance of Hotels and Resorts. One can find accommodation to fit the modest budget as well as the expensive and luxurious star resorts that offer top notch amenities Food in Hyderabad Apart from the Charminar, Hyderabad is known for serving the most scrumptious Biriyani and Shawarma rolls in India (Well, that was indeed one of the prime reasons for me to visit Hyderabad ). The delectable Biriyani served with Kebabs is definitely one of the biggest attractions for a food lover, and eateries in Hyderabad (especially Paradise Restaurant) surely would not dishearten the foodie in you! Hyderabadi Biriyani by Abhishek Sanyal Places of Interest There is no dearth of tourist attractions in Hyderabad. In my short stopover for a couple of days, I did manage to visit a few tourist attractions The Charminar History of the Charminar by Abhishek Sanyal The English name is a translation and combination of the Urdu words Chār and Minar', translating to \"Four Towers\" There are various theories regarding the purpose of making Charminar, but as per ASI reports, it is widely accepted that Charminar was built at the center of the city, to commemorate the obliteration of plague, a deadly disease which was widespread at that time. It is said that Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah had prayed for the end of a plague that was ravaging his city and vowed to build a Mosque at the very place where he supposedly prayed. Various Historians suggest that the Charminar was completed around 1592. Mecca Masjid Mecca Masjid by Abhishek Sanyal The name is derived as the bricks, to build the central arch, were supposedly brought from Mecca. The Qutb Shahis supposedly started the construction the mosque but never finished it; it was later completed by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in 1694. The Golconda Fort Apart from the Charminar, another well-known cultural hotspot in Hyderabad is the Golconda Fort. Positioned 11 kilometers west of Hyderabad, The Golconda Fort was the capital of the ancient kingdom of Golconda which flourished in the 14th to 16th century. The Golconda Fort by Abhishek Sanyal A visit to this considerately designed fort left me completely flabbergasted at its exquisiteness, potency and positioning. The impregnable walls of this handsome fort range from 17 to 34 feet, and are broken by close to 90 semi-circular bastions, with some reaching heights close to 60 feet. The Golconda Fort was built on a stonework hill that is about 120 meters high; thus making it one of Incredible Indias most striking forts. The Golconda Fort by Abhishek Sanyal The Golconda Fort derives its name from the word Golla Konda which means Shepherds Hill. Built almost 800 years ago in 945 CE-970 CE, by the Kakatiyas, The Golconda fort primarily served as part of their western defenses; much before the rise of the kingdom of Golconda. Other places of interest in Hyderabad include Salar Jung Museum, AP State Archaeological Museum, Birla Mandir , Hussainsagar Lake and much more .., which I could not visit due to my extremely short stopover but I have plans to visit this amazing city and rediscover my love for monuments and food. The Karachi Bakery Being a true foodie, a special mention in this post would be for the renowned Karachi Bakery, which boasts of a chronicle of over six decades, since 1953. With a solid reputation that is unmatched, the products Karachi Bakery are one of a kind. Karachi Bakery by Abhishek Sanyal Albeit Hyderabad does not have a scarcity of bakeries, Karachi Bakery has always been ahead of its competitors, exceeding the expectations of its patrons with the uncompromising quality of products. As my short stopover was on the verge of completion, I was indeed left flabbergasted with the royal exquisiteness and rich historical and cultural value that Hyderabad has to offer I left the city, with a promise to return and continue exploring the exquisiteness Hyderabad has on offer Hyderabad is one of those few cities where you would find a fine blend of modernity and tradition !!! BE YOURSELF Everyone else is already taken !!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T15:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T17:31:55.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
