As a professional photographer, often. The most testing journey I did was going from Tokyo to Beijing to London and then to Los Angeles a couple of days later. What do you need for a perfect holiday? My family and a good camera. I have a great Lowepro black compact rucksack that fits a 35mm camera and a couple of spare lenses, my wallet and some snacks. Favourite holiday destination? Long Island in New York. As my mother was American, it has been part of my life since I was a child. I have fond memories of large family dinners there, full of laughter. Because I grew up there, I’m really relaxed too. The beaches are so long and beautiful whatever the weather. In the summer, it’s great to go barefoot and let the ocean breeze blow away the city cobwebs in your head. And in winter it’s great to wrap up warm and watch the ocean. There are always never-ending views. Montauk, Long Island in New York (Fotolia/AP) The most dreamy place you’ve been in terms of scenery? I’ve always loved Jamaica as its weather is so different from that in England. There’s something lovely, too, about walking along the beach in the evening, with sand between your toes, the sound of waves lapping and the breeze rustling the leaves. It’s so lush and exotic inland, too, in the mountains: very green and overgrown and beautiful. I haven’t been for a while, but I used to love staying at Round Hill in Montego Bay. Where have you taken your best photographs? That’s such a hard question to answer because my photography projects take me all over the world, from America to Russia to France to China. I love photographing people in New York; it has such a great cross-section of people from all over the world. Ochios Rios, Jamaica (Fotolia/AP) Your most adventurous travel experience? Driving out of Beijing to a small village to visit a local family and photograph them at home. It was for a charity called Smile Train, photographing a family whose son had benefited from cleft palette surgery. The village was tiny – more like a community – and decorated with rich, typically Chinese greens and reds. The family all made us feel so welcome, and had made us delicious food from vegetables that they’d grow in the area. The most remote place you’ve been? The wilds of the Orkney Islands. I went there to visit and photograph the Highland Park Distillery, a wonderful experience as it was like going back in time. The makers still use the original distilling techniques. I took one particular photograph there that I find so romantic and dreamy and it’s of the smoking room where they flavour the barley. Your most relaxing destination? Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano, Italy. I went there for the most restorative four-day break with my husband. The views of the sea and the blue sky were perfection. The food was great too, and the interiors really Italian, with pale colours and Italian tiles. Have you ever been on safari? The Orkney Islands (Fotolia/AP) No, but I would love to go because there are now eco-safaris that seem to be more focused on the wellbeing of the animals. Favourite city? Apart from London, it would have to be New York City, my mother’s home town. I did a photo shoot there recently where I shot in seven locations in one day, and it was such an adventure. We went to the top floor of the Empire State Building, the Metropolitan Museum of Art early in the morning before it opened and then The High Line. Favourite shop? The Leica Shop in Bruton Place in London for cameras and lenses, and Alfies Antique Market in Lisson Grove, which is great for wandering around and browsing furniture or vintage clothes. Favourite hotel? The Mandarin Oriental in Bangkok. It has a colonial feel that is like stepping back in time. I expected Noel Coward to walk around the corner at any moment. I love their New York hotel too: the reception is on the 36th floor and has amazing views. Mandarin Oriental hotels are great at making you feel at home. They remember things: for instance which pillow you like. You can get ones filled with buckwheat or lavender. Worst travel experience? Well, it was the worst experience I have had but we actually ended up making it fun. I was travelling from Malta after a photo shoot for Harper’s Bazaar and the flight got delayed for six hours. It was painful trying to entertain ourselves through the night in the airport, but my team and I ended up laughing and dancing our way through it. Bathing in the Ganges in India (Alamy) Favourite airline? British Airways, because every time I get on one of their planes I feel like I am going home. Best piece of travel advice? Bring your essentials in hand luggage. I am always paranoid my checked bags will go missing. What do you hate about holidays? Long delays at the airport. Favourite restaurants abroad? Nobu in New York, where I discovered their amazing warm mushroom salad. And The River Café in London is wonderful too. Where next? I’d love to visit India; it looks like such an interesting place, so vibrant and full of colour. Monochrome & Colour by Mary McCartney is published by Gost Books ( gostbooks.com , £75).
