People use those technologies as a complimentary service,” said Mr Reimer.\n“Particularly within the Asia Pacific, there’s nothing like that human element, that human contact, the ability to shake hands on a deal.\n“Building up a business partnership is all about personalisation. I don’t think that’s going to be replaced anytime soon.” Improving the experience ... Virgin Australia boss John Borghetti believes the airline’s enhanced Super Diamond “business first” suite will only knock his opposition “out of the park’’. Picture: Supplied. Source: Supplied\nHe said Australian business people were among the biggest travellers in the world, as a result of the country’s “challenging” geography.\n“Australians have to travel to make themselves relevant; they have to go that extra distance,” Mr Reimer said.\n“We’re certainly seeing growth in business travel to the US which is no surprise given the improving economy. Australians want to be amongst that.”\nFierce competition among airlines for the corporate dollar has made life a bit easier for business travellers with lounges, lie-flat beds, restaurant quality meals and express processing now par for the course.\nAlthough business fares have almost returned to what they were before Virgin Australia took the fight up to Qantas in late 2011, Mr Reimer said most companies were happy to invest in the pointy end of the plane for key people.

Source: Supplied\n“You’re certainly seeing companies recognise that need for people to turn up fresh and hit the ground running, which means they view business travel as an investment rather than an expense,” he said.\n“Companies on the whole are very considerate of the experience their people have, and half an hour saved queuing up at an airport is valuable time.”\nVirgin Australia has set itself a goal of carrying 30 per cent of the Australian corporate market by 2017, six years after the airline began its transformation from budget to premium carrier.\nBut Qantas is not giving up any market share without a fight, having beaten its rival to new state of the art business suites on its A330 fleet earlier this year.\nBusiness passengers will finally get to experience Virgin Australia’s new suites, from mid-August.", "external_links": ["http://www.gbta.org/Pages/default.aspx", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/28/1227460/647199-2224a9b2-34ba-11e5-a865-966b1ff02c53.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/28/1227460/647116-f14372f6-34b9-11e5-a865-966b1ff02c53.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/28/1227460/647145-25c44f50-34ba-11e5-a865-966b1ff02c53.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-29T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T20:05:27.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
