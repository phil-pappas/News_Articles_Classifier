This recipe makes a sizeable salad, perfect if you need to bring something to a dinner or are feeding several people. If you’re making it just for yourself, you can halve the recipe and use a pint-size jar. SERVES 2 INGREDIENTS For the salad ½ cup uncooked bulgur wheat 1 cup boiling water 3 tbsp lemon vinaigrette (below) ½ cup chickpeas, rinsed and drained 3 tbsp chopped red onion ½ cup cubed English cucumber ½ cup diced red pepper ½ cup halved heirloom baby tomatoes 2 tbsp chopped fresh dill 2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley 70g crumbled feta cheese 1 litre Mason jar For the lemon vinaigrette 2 tbsp lemon juice pinch of salt freshly ground black pepper, to taste 3 tbsp olive oil METHOD Place the bulgur wheat in a Pyrex bowl and add the boiling water. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit for 20 minutes, or until the water is mostly absorbed. If there’s water left in the bowl, drain the bulgur and set it aside to cool. To make the vinaigrette, whisk together the lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Slowly add the olive oil, whisking, until the dressing thickens. Pour 3 tablespoons of the vinaigrette into the jar. Layer the salad into the jar, starting with the chickpeas, red onion, cucumber, and red pepper. The next layer should be the bulgur, packed down. On top of the bulgur, layer the tomatoes, dill, and parsley. Finish with the feta cheese. Seal the jar and refrigerate until ready to use.
