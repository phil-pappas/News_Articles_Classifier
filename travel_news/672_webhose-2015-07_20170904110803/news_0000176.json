The new space is designed to meet the needs of the city’s growing number of flexible workers, providing a relaxed but professional environment in the heart of one of central Leeds’ premier business locations. \nTwo of the centre’s three floors have been extensively refurbished to create a modern, stylish, open-plan space, which complements the building’s striking exterior. The refurbishment includes a large co-working area with individual private booths, a library and a relaxed kitchen area. The refurbished space has been designed with flexibility in mind and, as such, a range of workspace options have been created to suit all budgets. This includes a new co-working product that gives access to desk space in the open plan area, providing another cost effective way for companies and individuals to work. Regus expects the space to appeal to a wide range of people, including home workers looking for a change of atmosphere and local SMEs and start- ups looking to work in a dynamic, collaborative atmosphere. A networking event to celebrate the re-launch of the centre’s facilities is to take place on Thursday 16th July from 4.30 to 6.30 pm. The event, which will include sparkling wine and canapés, is free to attend and open to all. Anyone interested in attending is asked to contact the centre in advance on 0113 280 5800. Richard Morris, UK CEO at Regus, comments: “We’re delighted to announce the opening of our new range of workspace at Princes Exchange and I extend my thanks to the dedicated centre team and everyone who has worked so hard to ensure the project has been a success. “The world of work has changed irreversibly and flexibility has become the cornerstone of successful business, as workers find they are no longer shackled to a desk. Princes Exchange is designed to offer the perfect solution to those professionals who find they are able to work anywhere, but still value the structure and professional atmosphere of an office-type environment, at least some of the time.” He continues: “Demand for our flexible workspace proposition is at an all-time high and we remain committed to expanding our global footprint, making business easier for our customers and helping them grow flexibly and cost-effectively.” Regus has a global network of spanning 106 countries, including ten locations in Leeds.
