It certainly did for me. All my childhood holidays involved being levered into the back seat of a Mini “estate”, with my feet resting on a bag of tent poles while we drove first to Portsmouth, and then joined the long queue of cars at the ferry port. It was uncomfortable but it was exciting – and as we watched the Isle of Wight disappearing into the haze and ran round to the bow to see if we could see Cherbourg, there was a sense of unfolding adventure. Watching as we docked, and then descending onto the car deck and driving out into the sunlight and onto the wrong side of the road – those impressions are still burned deep in my memory. Of course, flying has its own excitements – and the no-frills airlines have done a brilliant job opening new routes and keeping fares low. But the delay-prone struggle from airport car park to arrivals concourse isn’t nearly as much fun as a ferry crossing on a summer’s day – even for grown-ups. Normandy offers splendid beaches and fine scenery. Photo: AP And in our rush to the Med, it is easy to forget that Normandy and Brittany , and France in general offers some of the most splendid beaches, most beautiful scenery, and best value for holidaymakers anywhere in Europe.

Contemporary ferries are slicker, cleaner and serve far better food than they did in the Seventies or Eighties, but the essential experience is still the same. For motorists, petrol and diesel are at their lowest for several years, and although there have been a few rises on the lowest fares, the cost of crossing the Channel is near its historical low. To help you choose the best route, here is our guide to all the routes into France and Spain this year, together with fares and frequencies. Fares In practice, most ferry fares have gone the way of airfares. They are extremely flexible and changed regularly according to how well a particular sailing is selling, and how near it is to the departure date. However, to try to give you perspective, those given below are the lowest standard return between May and September for a car plus at least two passengers. Cabin prices are not included in the basic fare and are listed separately where applicable for overnight crossings – they are for the cheapest available cabin for two or four people, and the price is for each crossing, not for a return. Frequencies are the number of departures from the British port at peak times. Crossing times may be slower on overnight legs. Read more: Spain ferry guide All comparisons are with last year’s fares and are based only on these lowest standard returns. Note that fares at peak times of day, during school holidays, and on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays are usually significantly higher. During National Ferry Fortnight (March 2-15) some operators have special offers – see the best here . The easiest way to compare fares between different operators is to use one of the price comparison sites that specialises in ferry travel.

Calais (Fotolia/AP) The short crossings The crossing to Calais remains the quickest and cheapest way to get to the Continent for most British motorists. With the ferry port linking directly into the French motorway network, even the other ports with a direct service from Britain can be reached more quickly via Calais. For example, the driving time from Calais to St Malo, is about five hours, while the ferry from Portsmouth to St Malo takes a full eight hours. Allow two hours for the short crossing and you will get there an hour quicker via Calais – even if you arrive much less relaxed. On the Dover routes you also have a huge number of ferry and tunnel departures, and four different operators from which to choose. But Calais (and Dunkirk) provide more than just quick access to the motorway system. This year sees three major battlefield anniversaries : the centenary of the Second Battle of Ypres, the bicentenary of Waterloo and the 600th anniversary of Agincourt – and all these sites are within easy reach of the northern ports. It is also the 75th anniversary of the Dunkirk evacuation – some of the surviving Little Ships will be making a return to the beaches.

By contrast, even though Eurotunnel is still more expensive than the ferry crossings, a trimming of rates by five per cent over the last year has resulted in the lowest differential between tunnel and sea crossing for many years. UPDATE: MyFerryLink ceased services on July 1, 2015 - details of how to rebook or claim a refund are at myferrylink.com.

If you prefer to head for the coast, see our expert’s selection of the best beach hotels . Compared with last year, fares on these routes are more stable than those on the shorter crossings. DFDS’s £78 return to Dieppe is unchanged, but the operator has dropped its route into Le Havre. Brittany Ferries’ fares have either been held at last year’s prices (as on Portsmouth–Cherbourg), or edged up a few pounds. Its Le Havre service still has the slower “economy” ferry and the fast craft which is two hours faster.

But for most holidaymakers the Brittany coast is primarily about beaches - see our expert's selection of the best coastal hotels in Brittany - and is also the gateway to the sands and the campsites of the Vendee farther south. Brittany Ferries’ fares are up £40 on the St Malo route and £10 on the Roscoff service. Condor has added a Poole to St Malo service. Brittany's coast is a lovely spot for a family holiday and ferry travel is a practical way of getting there.
