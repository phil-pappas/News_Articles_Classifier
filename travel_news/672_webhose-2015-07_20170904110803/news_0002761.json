It’s the largest concentration of Indigenous sites in Australia, eclipsing Kakadu which has around 5,000 sites but over a much greater land mass, says Pickering. \nAfter leaving his job in the finance industry last year, Pickering started Sydney Out Back which runs Indigenous rock art tours in the national park that borders Sydney’s northern suburbs and in the adjacent Hawkesbury river. He’s passionate about the national park and believes it’s underappreciated.\n“I’ve met some people who live in Curl Curl [on the nearby northern beaches] who haven’t even been here,” he says.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The view to Lion Island – where five waterways meet – from West Head in Sydney’s Ku-ring-gai Chase national park.

Within an hour of the city limits sits the Royal national park to the south and the Blue Mountains to the west, and 45 minutes from the city lies the 14,977 hectare Ku-ring-gai Chase national park.\n“What we are seeing today is a time capsule from pre-European times,” says Pickering near the park entrance. We walk a few metres to a picturesque clearing that reveals a sandstone rockface, thick bushland and a creek where water is flowing fast down rocks due to overnight rain. It’s one of those brilliant, sunny winter days, where the smell of the eucalypt is especially strong and fresh. The city feels very far away. \nUntil recent times, the area remained relatively unexplored. It wasn’t until the 1960s that roads were built into the park, with the road to Cottage Point (where there is a lovely restaurant) not built until 1967.\nWe are visiting on a Wednesday and come across only five other people – all at local beauty spot West Head lookout, with a great view across to Palm Beach (and the set of Home and Away), Barrenjoey lighthouse and Lion Island. The beach beneath the lookout is also the place of first recorded contact between NSW governor Arthur Phillip and Indigenous Australians .\nOur Indigenous guide, Les McLeod, passes around old logs from the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service. The logs are fascinating, cataloguing all the known rock art in the region: what the site is, what it depicts and its level of degradation.\nThe area’s significant Indigenous sites include rock engravings, art sites, burial sites, caves or shelters (some with shell deposits), marriage areas, men’s areas, women’s areas, birthing areas, midden sites, stone arrangement sites and tool manufacturing locations.\nBut first we have a welcome to country. We are on Guringai land, and McLeod has the elders’ permission to hold tours and explain the rock art.\nMcLeod smears ochre on our faces and hands and we stand in a circle as he claps message sticks.\nThe first rock art he takes us to is carved into the ground on a flat, treeless ledge in the park. The engravings here are outlines created on rock surfaces by pecking, hammering or scraping. Their exact age isn’t known but Pickering estimates they’re between 5,000 and 7,000 years old.\nWe have to bush-bash to get in there, and a small sign is the only hint of what lies off the track. McLeod squirts water over the rocks and an enormous engraving – metres long – of a serpent appears.\n“A lot of Aboriginal people believe they were created from animals – there are engravings here of wallabies, fish and emus,” says McLeod. “Sydney sandstone is easy to engrave but easy to fade. The Guringai people would have visited a couple of times a year to re-engrave it.”\nHe and Pickering speculate that some of the patterns on the rocks resemble the Milky Way and may have been intended as an astrological guide. The site would have also been a meeting place for ceremonies and corroborees, says McLeod.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Hawkesbury river – home to many significant Indigenous sites. Photograph: Sydney Out Back Then it’s on to Akuna Bay. From the (very posh) marina, we sail up the Hawkesbury river on a very comfortable charter boat in order to see Indigenous rock art that’s visible only from the water. \n“Sometimes the best way to see Aboriginal sites is actually in the natural environment, as opposed to in a museum or art gallery,” says McLeod as we get close to a small cave on the water’s edge where there are ochre hand stencils from a group of Guringai men (and from a smaller handprint – a child). The stencils would have been a way of letting other members of your clan know that this particular cave or ledge is a safe place to stay, McLeod explains.\nFurther up the river we come across rock paintings of a fish just above the water line. This would have been a signal to others that fish could be found at this spot, says McLeod. \n(As an aside: if you haven’t been the Hawkesbury, get there. It’s one of the most magnificent rivers in the world, with bushland running all the way down to the water and has a particular quality of silence broken only by the occasional lyre bird or kookaburra.)\nThe part of the Hawkesbury we’re in is fairly remote (and we are the only boat in these waters), but McLeod doesn’t want us going much further. There are significant Indigenous sites upriver but they have been vandalised with racist graffiti.\nIt’s a jolt back to reality after an afternoon exploring such a pristine environment. Nature may wear away at the rock art, but it’s human beings who pose the biggest threat. \n\nSydney Out Back offer eight-hour Wilderness + Aboriginal Explorer Tour + Cruise tours on Mondays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays; $149-199 Four Indigenous tourism experiences around Sydney and New South Wales Harry Nanya Tours run full-day trips to the Mungo national park in western NSW with an Indigenous guide to explore significant sites including the restricted Walls of China sand and clay formations.\nAboriginal Blue Mountains Walkabout focuses on dreamtime stories.
