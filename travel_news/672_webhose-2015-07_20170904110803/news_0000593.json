Walking trails take you in among them. \nSee nps.gov/brca . \nGRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK \nThe first sighting of the Grand Canyon always comes as a surprise. It's not one giant slot in the desert, but a staggering series of splinters dominating the horizon. The coloured layers in the rock, though, remain strikingly consistent. \nThe Grand Canyon is a must-see for many visitors. Photo: US National Parks Service \nThe first sighting of the Grand Canyon always comes as a surprise. It's not one giant slot in the desert, but a staggering series of splinters dominating the horizon. The coloured layers in the rock, though, remain strikingly consistent. \nFor many, an encounter with the Grand Canyon involves a day trip from Las Vegas and a couple of crowded lookouts. Far more rewarding is the view from the less accessible north rim, or the south rim from Flagstaff, Arizona. \nHiking and rafting trips inside the canyon offer a more rounded perspective. \nSee nps.gov/grca . \nYELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK \nIt's the original – in 1872, Yellowstone became the world's first national park – and arguably the best. \nYellowstone stretches over the north-west of Wyoming, overlapping slightly into Idaho and Montana, but its strength is its sheer variety. \nYellowstone is on top of a giant volcanic caldera. Photo: US National Parks Service \nIt's on top of a giant volcanic caldera, and has an array of strange geothermal features, such as the Grand Prismatic Spring and the Old Faithful geyser, but it also has its own grand canyon with a thunderously plunging waterfall, mountainous back country and world-class wildlife viewing. \nThe Lamar Valley is particularly good for spotting bison, moose and bears. \nSEQUOIA NATIONAL PARK \nGiant trees are one of the highlights at Sequoia. Photo: US National Parks Service \nThis Californian escape's advertised highlight is the trees, in particular, the largest tree on earth. The General Sherman is more than 80 metres high and has a base circumference of more than 30 metres, but it is not alone – plenty more giant sequoias have been spared the chainsaw, and the dwarfing groves of them give the Sequoia National Park its character. \nThe depth and variety, however, come elsewhere. The landscape is riddled with caves, many of which visitors can explore in relative safety, while the Sierra Nevada mountain backdrop adds spectacle. \nMount Whitney, at 4421 metres the tallest mountain in the 48 contiguous US states, is the most prominent. \nSee nps.gov/seki . \nMESA VERDE NATIONAL PARK \nMost of the national arks in the south-west are about the landscapes, but this one in southern Colorado is more cultural than natural. \nThere are more than 5000 archaeological sites in Mesa Verde. Photo: US National Parks Service \nThere's still plenty of rugged scenery, but there are also more than 5000 archaeological sites contained within Mesa Verde's boundaries. They're the remnants left by the ancient Pueblo people who lived there before the European conquest of the Americas, and some of the homes built into precarious cliff faces are remarkably well preserved. \nCliff Palace has the most spectacular examples and, perhaps more than any other park, this is where the ranger-guided tours shed admirable light. \nEVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK \nThe Everglades features an extensive mangrove system. Photo: US National Parks Service \nWhile most of the US national parks feature soaring mountain scenery and plunging gorges, the Everglades are almost entirely flat. Visitors go there for eco-systems rather than elevation. \nAt the southern tip of Florida, this steamy, wild expanse of swampland is the world's slowest-moving river. There's almost no development within the confines, and exploring is generally done by airboat or squelchy wading in the relative shallows. \nThe extensive mangrove system has created a rich haven for wildlife. It doesn't take too much nosing around to find alligators, panthers and manatees.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T15:34:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
