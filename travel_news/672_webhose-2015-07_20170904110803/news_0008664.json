It all started when she relocated to Los Angeles from the East Coast. “I was looking though old Seditionaries photos and came to the Tom of Finland cowboy shirt and wanted one, so I made it for myself,” she recalls. “I respect what Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood did with that brand, making each creation unique and one of a kind.” Every Vance shirt is hand drawn and dyed, a choice Zoe made to keep the numbers down, allowing her to focus on creating unique garments. Her first collection is inspired by Seditionaries, Formula 1 racing car culture, typography, fetish artists like Eric Stanton and John Willie, and the classic 1958 documentary Jazz on a Summer’s Day . The first Vance lookbook starring Annabelle Dexter-Jones was photographed by Stevie Dance at her home, and it does a great job of illustrating the brand’s attitude and overall identity. An online store is in the works, but for now Zoe is happy taking orders via e-mail. She is also developing knit dresses and separates that will be available next year.", "external_links": ["http://www.steviedance.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php", "https://instagram.com/vancestudios/", "https://instagram.com/abanel/?hl=en"], "published": "2015-07-24T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T19:42:46.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
