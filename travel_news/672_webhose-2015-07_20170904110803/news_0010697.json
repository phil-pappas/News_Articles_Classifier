Some scoff at it. Some swear by it. \nBut one thing is clear: Bitcoin has entered the mainstream as of late, with Bitcoin ATMs even popping up throughout the world, from Los Angeles to Tel Aviv to Rome. \nItâ€™s safe to say that Hotelgo24.com is a fan. \nBooking a room through Hotelgo24.com is fairly straightforward and simple, using the traditional format most OTAs feature. After completing the reservation, a confirmation email is sent to the user. Payment can be made via credit card. \nRegistration is not required to use the service, but you must register to receive Bitcoins. According to a press release, Bitcoin cash back is sent within seven days of guest checkout from the booked hotel. The amount of Bitcoin cash back that a client will receive depends on the reservation value and Bitcoin exchange rate on the day of booking (as of this writing, one Bitcoin equals $272.51). \nFor more information, visit www.Hotelgo24.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T04:43:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
