You can never underinvest in training and development. \"And also make sure your people know how to adapt the company and that you go to market well-equipped to change things when your market is inevitably disrupted.” Keep the customer satisfied Customer service will always be vitally important, wherever you operate. Berkshire-based design company Qwerty’s customers include Walkers Crisps and Lindt. Sales director Martin Gardner says: “Treat everybody the same regardless of the amount of money they spend. We pride ourselves on our flexible can-do attitude to our customers’ needs. Nothing is ever too much trouble and this has been a major factor in our success.” Don’t underestimate the advantage of local connection nationally. “Ninety-five per cent of our business comes from word of mouth or clients who take us on their journey,” says Mr Gardner. “We have grown from looking after small businesses to now looking after some of the biggest brands in the country due to hard work, investment in technology and, most importantly, customer service,” he adds. Don’t be afraid to take it slow If everything is focused on rapid growth, you’re likely to run out of capital. Fund your expansion carefully and gradually so you don’t become over-leveraged. West Yorkshire wholesaler and workers’ cooperative Suma has expanded its customer base from the north of England to the whole of the UK since it started in the Seventies. Suma member Rob Melling says: “When we go into a new area, it’s often because we’re requested by the customers. We don’t go in aggressively or buy sales.” Mr Melling adds: “Don’t sell something you can’t continue providing. If you have a good product and you are selling it properly you’ll get organic growth.” Know your market inside out Emma Myers started her company BruzZ back in 2013, as a new style of electric nail brush with replaceable antibacterial bristles. She says: “At first the demand was in the most unlikely of places, such as farms and mechanics and we had lots of beauty salons and farms take it on locally.” When BruzZ was a local business, says Ms Myers: “it was so much easier to promote and literally do the leg work that was required. We did local Christmas market stalls, school fairs, raffle prizes, the whole lot.” But then sales spiralled. She says: “We then had a huge task on our hands to bring a product that had been designed for salon retail to the mass market.” BruzZ is now stocked in Boots. The key, Ms Myers says, is “knowing your industry and knowing your marketplace, which is very hard when you are trying to appeal to everyone in the world.” Don’t compromise Warner Edwards’ gins distil in a 200-year-old converted barn in Northamptonshire. The company is two-and-a-half-years old and started producing locally but its gin is now being stocked in Fortnum & Mason and some top bars in the capital. Head of sales, Ross Strachan, says: “Everything we do, we do to the best of our ability, capability or resource. We use the best possible equipment and ingredients, the highest quality methods and processes, even if there are inherent inefficiencies. If we can't do something to a ‘world-class’ standard we don’t do it at all.” • For more advice on preparing your business for the tech challenges of the future, visit HP BusinessNow You may also be interested in: • Top seedfunding tips for SMEs • Five ways to battle cybercrime • Five ways for SMEs to motivate staff to save costs • How to run a successful virtual office • Five of the best bookkeeping apps for SMEs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T02:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T21:55:47.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
