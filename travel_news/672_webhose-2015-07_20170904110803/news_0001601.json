Alaa Bader al-Hashemi, 30, was caught on the mall’s closed circuit television behaving oddly before and after the killing, in the women’s toilets of the Boutik Mall. The court had heard she engineered a confrontation with Ibolya Ryan, 47, a Romanian-born American teacher and mother of three children, before stabbing her to death. The speed of her execution at dawn on Monday, just two weeks after the initial verdict and death sentence were handed down and only seven months after the killing, is most likely intended to send a message to the United Arab Emirates’ large expatriate population that they are well-protected. It may also be intended to signal that there will be zero tolerance of jihadist and other opposition in the country, which has one of the toughest records in the region on Islamist groups, including ones that claim to be entirely peaceful. Ibolya Ryan was stabbed to death Hashemi’s full motives were never clear, and there are rumours in the UAE that she was part of a broader militant conspiracy. A mother of six children aged between nine months and ten years, she told investigators that her husband, Mohammed al-Habashi al-Hashemi, had been a militant supporter who made her watch and listen to recordings of jihadist leaders like Osama Bin Laden and the founder of Islamic State in Iraq, Abu Musab Al Zarqawi. Prosecutors said she watched videos on bomb-making as well as jihadi beheading films, and that she also sent money to al-Qaeda in Yemen. She decided to take direction action herself after her husband was arrested last November. She said she was “seeking vengeance” for her husband and wanted to spread fear through American, British and French expatriates in particular. She showed enough initiative to scout the Boutik Mall, on Abu Dhabi’s Reem Island, in advance, before driving back in her husband’s white Nissan Armada, hiding a knife in her sock. She picked up a magazine and asked the way to the toilets. There she passed up her first potential victim - an unidentified British woman - because she had a pram with a baby in it. She then attacked Mrs Ryan, who lived in Abu Dhabi with her twin daughters aged 11, and whose 13-year-old son lived with her ex-husband in Vienna, stabbing her to death. “She started screaming for help and I pushed her to the wall where I stabbed her – I don’t know how many times, but mostly in her chest area,” she said, in a video-recording of her interrogation, shown to the court. She dropped the knife, and then brushed past a security guard who came to investigate the screaming, before returning to her car. The CCTV camera showed Hashemi wearing a full black abaya - cloak - and niqab -face-veil - behaving in an agitated way as she waited for a lift. She then drove to the house of an Egyptian-American doctor, Mohammed Hassan Hassan, and planted a bomb outside. On the way, she sent a text message to an unnamed member of the Abu Dhabi royal family, saying: “The mujahideen have reached the midst of your home.” She used a different phone to call police to tell them about a “bleeding expatriate woman”. The bomb was not properly constructed, and was found by Dr Hassan’s son. At the time of her arrest, police showed video demonstrating her jihadist links, including of bomb-making equipment. But her erratic behaviour in the CCTV video, and her half-hearted attempts to cover her tracks, also lent weight to her claim in court that she was suffering a mental illness and was “possessed by spirits” . She was ruled sane by a medical report. The statement carried by the state news agency confirming her execution gave few details, but local media said it was by firing squad, which is the regulation method in the UAE. Although courts in Abu Dhabi and even Dubai hand down death sentences regularly, few are ever carried out. The only other executions in the last five years were of a Sri Lankan domestic worker last year accused of deliberately running over and killing a local friend of his employer, and in 2011 of a local man who raped and killed a four-year-old boy.
