Partner to Deliver Organic, Heritage Meats to the Bay Area \nSAN FRANCISCO, CA--(Marketwired - Jul 17, 2015) - Munchery , the leader in high-quality meal delivery, and Belcampo Meat Co. , the first of its kind in butchery, today announce a partnership to make premium meats more accessible in the San Francisco Bay Area. Munchery will deliver chef-prepared meals made with Belcampo's humanely-raised, organic meats directly to people in the Bay Area, expanding the availability of Belcampo's products beyond its butcher shops and restaurants. \n\"Serving local, sustainable and delicious ingredients is fundamental to the Munchery vision, and there are few companies in the world that represent that ideal more than Belcampo,\" said Munchery VP of Food, Nicolas Bernadi. \"This partnership is only the beginning of our mission to make it easier for people across America to discover and enjoy high-quality ingredients -- and to help diners learn about innovative, mindful food suppliers in their cities like Belcampo.\" \nThe new collaboration was born from both companies' commitment to sourcing from local suppliers to bring the best possible products to customers everywhere. Through its vertically integrated farms and state-of-the-art processing plant in California's Shasta Valley, as well as its butcher shop and restaurant locations, Belcampo directly manages the entire meat production chain to minimize waste and ensure quality. Munchery also employs an end-to-end model in preparing meals in-house for direct delivery to customers. \n\"Partnering with Munchery allows us to offer our proprietary line of organic meats, expertly prepared in new ways, straight to customers in the Bay Area,\" said Belcampo CEO Anya Fernald. \"We're giving people who care about food safety, flavor and environmental responsibility a new way to experience Belcampo's array of flavorful and sustainable meats.\" \nBelcampo currently operates three locations in the Bay Area, including its flagship store and restaurant in Marin, with plans to open a fourth Bay Area butcher shop this summer. Munchery's model of purchasing and cooking at scale will enable it to offer Belcampo entrees for roughly $15, compared to an average cost of $25 at Belcampo restaurants. \nBelcampo Culinary Director Ross Wollen will work with Munchery chefs Bridget Batson, Steven Levine and Raymond Reyes to develop the menu. During the week of July 20, Munchery will feature one kind of Belcampo meat per day from Monday to Thursday. After launch, Belcampo meats will be available in limited quantities on the first Tuesday of each month. Initial menu items include lamb meatballs with couscous, pork sirloin with farro and chimichurri, beef bourguignon pasta and BBQ chicken sandwich with coleslaw. Each order will include a coupon for Belcampo's brick-and-mortar locations. The menu opens for pre-order today. \nAbout Munchery Munchery is a new kind of food company on a mission to make real food accessible to everyone, everywhere.
