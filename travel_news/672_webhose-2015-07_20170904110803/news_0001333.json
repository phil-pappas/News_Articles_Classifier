Hyatt is developing a new, multi-year partnership with Khan Academy, a non-profit organization dedicated to providing free access to world-class education online. This partnership represents the first time that Khan Academy will be collaborating with a hospitality company. \nOver the course of the collaboration, Hyatt will bring Khan Academy’s multi-language learning platform to its colleagues, their families and their communities. Beyond that, it will also extend its reach to equip people everywhere with specially developed life skills and hospitality learning. Working together, both organizations hope to help close the skills gap, especially for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds or areas. This will be accomplished through individual advancement opportunities conducted in a mix of physical and digital settings that optimize learning. \n“We are in the business of caring for people so they can be their best, and a big part of that is helping not only our colleagues, but those in our communities, to reach their full potential,” said Mark Hoplamazian, President and CEO of Hyatt Hotels Corporation. “Khan Academy is a revolutionary force in bringing knowledge to anyone who seeks it, and working together, we can teach skills and change lives all over the world.” \nHyatt and Khan Academy will be prototyping several onsite and digital initiatives throughout the next year. Hyatt intends to partner with Khan Academy to bring the organization’s successful learning programs to all Hyatt colleagues around the world and their families. Beginning in 2016, Hyatt also envisions setting up learning labs in its hotels throughout Chicago to give colleagues, guests and community members access to Khan Academy curricula, such as financial literacy, economics and computer programming. These learning labs would then be rolled out to other cities across the world throughout the multi-year partnership. Finally, Khan Academy will share its learning content expertise to assist Hyatt with the development of one-of-a-kind content and courses designed around life skills and the skills needed for a career in hospitality. \n“Our mission is to provide a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere,” said Sal Khan, Founder of Khan Academy. “We are delighted to be working with Hyatt – their team has a long history of supporting communities around the world, and the combination of our online resources with their physical footprint will help us reach even more students in a meaningful way.” \nHoplamazian announced Hyatt’s commitment in his closing remarks at Hyatt’s Global Summit in Orlando, Fla., where 800-plus company leaders from every hotel and region around the world gathered for three days to focus on the company’s purpose and strategic direction. \n“I’ve seen great success in engaging our communities and providing life skills training – it benefits not just the participants, but also our communities, guests and hotels,” said Thierry Guillot, General Manager of Hyatt Regency Mexico City. “When we’re able to provide individuals with the skills they need for a job in hospitality, or any other job, it is encouraging and inspiring. I’m excited to see the potential power of our collaboration with Khan Academy rolled out around the world.” \nThe term \"Hyatt\" is used in this release for convenience to refer to Hyatt Hotels Corporation, Hyatt Hotels Foundation and/or one or more of their affiliates. \nFor more information on Hyatt and its corporate responsibility efforts, please visit www.hyattthrive.com . \nAbout Hyatt Hotels Corporation \nHyatt Hotels Corporation, headquartered in Chicago, is a leading global hospitality company with a proud heritage of making guests feel more than welcome.
