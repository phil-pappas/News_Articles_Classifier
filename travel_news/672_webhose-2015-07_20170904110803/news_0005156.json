We forget about that sizeable pocket of land that lies between the two: the Midlands. After living my life in the south of England, the Midlands is where I have now found my home. Nottingham certainly packs a punch when it comes to dining, shopping, nightlife, sport and culture. I have heard the city described as a “Goldilocks” city: not too big, not too small – just right. This certainly tallies with my experience. I can walk to almost anywhere within the city – although in some places the city’s extensive bus network is a much better option. Nottingham also has the stunning Peak District, Sherwood Forest and the river Trent close by. ... with easy access to the rest of the country there is no reason to feel isolated in Nottingham With direct rail and bus links to London and easy access to the rest of the country, as well as East Midlands Airport on your doorstep, there is no reason to feel isolated in Nottingham. Internally, the brand new 51-stop tram system is always a good option, but if that’s not your thing then you can take advantage of the new £6.1m investment in cycle lanes. But the city isn’t just about the new; Nottingham is steeped in history that defines its character. Strolling around the castle walls you can find the spot where, in 1642, Charles I famously called the city to arms; down the road you come to a statue of Robin Hood, and continuing around the corner you’ll find a plaque celebrating the home of the Romantic poet Lord Byron. Nottingham fuses an eclectic history with the demands of a diverse, modern-day population Oh, and if that isn’t enough, Nottingham also boasts Ye Olde Trip To Jerusalem , purported to be the oldest inn in England serving traditional food and craft beer. But one of the beauties of Nottingham is its ability to fuse an eclectic history with the demands of a diverse, modern-day population. A brilliant example of this is World Service , a restaurant that’s housed in a 17th century townhouse and which blends modern British cuisine along with influences from around the world, alongside a mouth-watering cocktail menu. By far my favourite restaurant, however, is Yamas , a fusion restaurant that centres on Mediterranean tapas. To the east of the Old Market Square, you can walk straight out of the Lace Market, a key location in the city’s industrial heritage, directly into Hockley where you will find an exciting mix of bars, restaurants, hotels, cinemas and theatres. In this part of town you’ll come across Paul Smith’s favourite cinema, the Broadway , the secret Boilermaker cocktail bar and many favourite hideouts of the city’s 60,000 student population. Beyond that, you find the Capital FM Arena – home to the Nottingham Panthers ice hockey team and host to some of the world’s biggest acts including Arctic Monkeys, Beyoncé and Michael McIntyre. It is a pleasure to live in a city that has something for all tastes The Old Market Square is the very heart of the city, with shops to cater to every taste. Peppered around the edges of the square are many of the city’s most popular restaurants, their variety testament to the city’s cultural diversity. Not far away are the Theatre Royal Concert Hall, an IMAX cinema and various nightclubs including Rock City and Ocean, the two most popular student venues. Further out, you can explore Wollaton Park , famous as the set of Wayne Manor in the Batman trilogy, the Forest Recreation ground, location of the world famous Goose Fair , and West Bridgford, a paradise for sports enthusiasts with its two football clubs, Trent Bridge cricket ground and a rugby club interwoven with bars, restaurants and residences. Writing this makes me realise that it is nearly impossible to summarise Nottingham in such a short space, but I hope my passion and love for this city has come across. It is a pleasure to live in a city that has something for all tastes. • Find more tips for studying, working and gap years on The Axis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T01:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T19:37:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
