It was discovered by climbers who were attempting the route and had to turn back.\n\"What used to be relatively easy climbing has gotten much more difficult,\" park geologist and climber Greg Stock said.\nHalf Dome — an icon of the park that is visible throughout Yosemite Valley — is scaled by hundreds of experienced climbers each year.\nThe rock fell from halfway up the sheer face of Half Dome, which rises more than 1,000 feet. A path for hikers using cable handrails was not changed.\nThere are several routes for climbers to scale Half Dome, but the one impacted when the rock fell ranks as one of the top 50 climbing destinations in North America, said Mike Gauthier, Yosemite's chief of staff and an avid climber.\nSuch falls occur often in Yosemite Valley and on other climbing destinations, forcing climbers to find new routes, he said.\n\"Now is their chance to find a new work-around,\" Gauthier said of Half Dome. \"And they will.\"\nNobody was injured or witnessed the rock fall believed to have happened last week.\nRenowned climber Kevin Jorgeson said the fallen section had been one of his favourite routes. He has twice scaled Half Dome.\nIn addition, he and climbing partner Tommy Caldwell made history early this year with a free climb up Dawn Wall on the opposite side of Yosemite Valley.\n\"It's on a lot of people's lists for a classic big wall route to climb,\" he said of Half Dome. \"It would be uninformed to say that it is impossible.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T23:25:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
