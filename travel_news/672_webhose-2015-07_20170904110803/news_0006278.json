This product is an option for those passengers who have heavier than 7 kg cabin baggage, SpiceJet said in a statement.\nIt is especially designed for those travellers who have no check-in luggage and do not want to be forced to check in their cabin baggage and then wait for it at baggage claim, the airline added.\n“Until now, passengers who had heavier than 7 kg carry-on bags were forced to check them in, which benefited neither them nor us. Many of our passengers, especially corporate travelers, told us they would be willing to pay a small fee for the option of carrying slightly heavier bags onboard,” said SpiceJet COO Sanjiv Kapoor.\nHowever, SpiceJet’s existing 7 kg free cabin baggage has remained unchanged and the number of bags allowed aboard is one plus a standard shoulder sized laptop bag/ladies purse or the maximum permitted physical size dimensions, SpiceJet added in the statement.\nThe new scheme applies to all domestic flights and international flights from India.\nSpiceJet flies 252 daily flights to 41 destinations of which 31 are Indian and seven international.\nFor Updates Check Company News ; follow us on Facebook and Twitter\n 11:28 am", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress", "http://twitter.com/financialxpress"], "published": "2015-07-10T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T15:05:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
