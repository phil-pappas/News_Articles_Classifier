Industry consultants, Exhibition Consultants Ltd (part of the Angus Montgomery Group) have joined forces with tfconnect's global talent service to create an all-in-one solution to issues facing venue owners around the world. The MONTGOMERY TFCONNECT PARTNERSHIP will provide specialist venue consultancy and market analysis, alongside senior talent aquisition services for venues and organisers. \nThe idea for 'MTP' emerged from ECL and tfconnect's roles as events industry advisors to Wasps Rugby Ltd in their bold and successful move of Wasps RFC to Coventry, including the acquisition and re-launch of Coventry's Ricoh Arena and its integral exhibition and conference facilities. Wasps opted to take on tfconnect as a recruitment partner which, led to the appointment of both Andy Gibb as the new Group Managing Director, as well as a Financial Director. Working with venue owners, the partnership is able to identify how to improve performance, devise strategy and then build a contracted or permanent executive management team to take the lead on launches, redevelopment or other major event projects. Trevor Foley, MD of tfconnect, said 'It's a hugely exciting time for our industry - as we see continued convergence between exhibitions, conferences and interactive business events, driven and enabled by technology and connectivity. Greater flexibility in facility design, know-how and operation is now needed to adapt to this evolution. Now is a good time for venues around the world to take a look at their business model and to make sure they have the right people in place to drive their projects forward.' The joint venture combines the long experience of Montgomery's management consultancy company, Exhibition Consultants Ltd, with tfconnect's high-quality network of global industry talent. Sandy Angus, Chairman of Montgomery and Director of Exhibition Consultants Ltd, said 'There is a need for existing venues to review their space, assess how it is used, how it can be used more creatively and how it should be modernised to host the events of today and tomorrow. Our advisory services are founded on decades of corporate experience and by joining hands with Trevor Foley, we can go further and provide client venues with a top executive team that can seamlessly carry forward optimal management.'
