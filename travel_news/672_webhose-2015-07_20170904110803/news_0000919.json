Police also found similar clips on a cellphone belonging to one of the South Africans, Xinhua said.\nIt cited the foreign affairs office of Ordos city in China's Inner Mongolia region, where police had stopped the 10 South Africans, 9 Britons and one Indian on July 10 as they were going to fly to Xi'an, home of the terracotta warriors and their next stop on a 47-day tour of the country. The British Embassy had said the group included nine Britons and two with dual British-South African nationalities.\nBritain's Press Association reported that the documentary was a BBC production on the 13th century Mongol warrior Genghis Khan, citing a statement from two of the British tourists, husband and wife Hoosain and Tahira Jacobs. They said that the video \"may have mistakenly been deemed as 'propaganda' material.'\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T16:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T09:41:48.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
