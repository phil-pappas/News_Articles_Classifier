Tourism Ireland’s short, fast-paced film was produced to coincide with ID2015, highlighting Belfast to potential visitors and urging people around the world to come and “be enticed and surprised by beautiful design in Belfast”. It features wonderful images of the city and includes places like Derek Wilson Ceramics, John Piekaar bespoke furniture, The Bureau Belfast, Maven interiors and gift shop, Oscar and Oscar architects, The Mac, St George’s Market and the Lyric Theatre. And, bearing in mind that design is not just a ‘feast’ for the eyes but for the taste buds too, some of our culinary and coffee creativity is also showcased in the film – including Established Coffee on Hill Street.\nSource:- Tourism IReland\nRelated Posts World-Renowned Voices Jet In For Conflict Conference PROMPERÚ to tap Indian travel market New Urban Adventure in Singapore makes stopover sightseeing easy Tourism Ireland is Tops For Digital Marketing, According to New Report Durkan calls ‘action’ for two new £14 million film studios", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T20:12:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
