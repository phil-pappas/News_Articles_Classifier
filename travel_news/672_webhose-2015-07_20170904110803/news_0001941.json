Business tourism is an important, high yield sector and Tourism Ireland has a busy programme of promotional activity in place to grow this type of tourism in 2015.\n“2014 was the strongest year ever for visitors to Ireland from Germany – and 2015 has also got off to a really positive start, with the most recent CSO figures showing growth of +17% in visitor numbers from Germany for the March to May period, an extra 23,800 German visitors compared with the same three-month period in 2014. Tourism Ireland is determined to ensure that tourism growth continues.”\nBusiness tourism is the most lucrative form of tourism, with visitors travelling here for business purposes spending about 2.5 times more than the average visitor.\nSource:- Tourism Ireland\nRelated Posts Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building Tourism Ireland is Tops For Digital Marketing, According to New Report Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium Chelsea Football Club Hosts Leaders Sport Summit 2013, the world’s most Prestigious Sport Business Summit TripAdvisor touches mark of 100 million downloads for free app for iPhone and Android", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T02:13:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
