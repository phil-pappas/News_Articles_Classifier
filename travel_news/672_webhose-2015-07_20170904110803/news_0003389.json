Photo Contributed Contributed Local Real Estate Cars For Sale \nTHERE'S something about spending a weekend somewhere that's so untouched by civilisation it makes you appreciate Mother Nature. \nMy partner Michael and I experienced her beauty when we headed off to O'Reilly's Rainforest Retreat in Lamington National Park for a few days of relaxation. \nDon't let the mostly one-lane road drive up the mountain put you off - once you get to the top I can guarantee it's nothing like you've seen before. \nAs we arrived late on Thursday night, checked in and grabbed some take-away from the restaurant (by the way, the staff there are absolutely amazing) and headed to bed early so we could get up and spend all of Friday exploring.

Photo Contributed Contributed \nAfter breakfast and a morning coffee the next day, we grabbed a trail map and began exploring the World Heritage listed national park. \nThe subtropical rainforest has 160km of walking trails, more than 500 waterfalls and 250 species of unique Australian wildlife. \nNot being experienced hikers, we picked one of the shorter trails on the map - the one to the Wishing Tree. \nBoth Michael and I agree the best part of the whole experience was striking off along a mountain track and not knowing where it was going to lead. It's really an adventure. \nWe spent the majority of the morning hiking along trying to find The Wishing Tree. Kate Dodd and Michael Schmidt spent a weekend at O'Reilly's Rainforest Retreat. Photo Contributed Contributed \nIt was really something special and, besides the walking tracks, it was virtually untouched by humans. \nBeing the dinosaur fan that I am, I kept expecting to see some sort of extinct creature jump out at me. \nWhen we did find the tree, it didn't disappoint. \nIt was absolutely beautiful and huge, it had to be hundreds of years old. \nAfter getting lost trying to find a waterfall, we headed back to the retreat for some afternoon tea and bird feeding. Even thought it was raining, the lorikeets headed straight to the bowls of food. Kate Dodd and Michael Schmidt spent a weekend at O'Reilly's Rainforest Retreat. Photo Contributed Contributed \nFeeding them was a great experience. The lorikeets jumped all over us and I think they left some seeds in my hair. To end the day, we went on a glow worm tour. \nTurns out a gloomy, rainy, wet night inside a rainforest is the best time to see the little creatures. \nIf you haven't seen glow worms before, do yourself a favour and go find some because it's really a beautiful sight. We turned out all the torches and sat on the benches and just looked in awe. Kate Dodd and Michael Schmidt spent a weekend at O'Reilly's Rainforest Retreat. Photo Contributed Contributed \nOur tour guide shared some stories with us - like how the glow worms glowed, what they ate, why they were where they were and the story of how, many years ago, trekkers came upon this particular spot. \nWhen we returned we enjoyed a lovely five-star dinner before chilling out in the library next to the fire to warm ourselves up and relax. \nBeing bookworms too, the library was something we particularly enjoyed. \nAfter checking out, we spent the next day at Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary, somewhere I hadn't been since I was a little kid.
