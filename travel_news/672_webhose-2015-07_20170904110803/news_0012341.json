But for others, they represent a horrible exile, where people lived long, painful lives and died alone.\nOn Molokai, a 30-minute flight from the holiday destination of Oahu, a dwindling population of people — once deemed such a threat to the rest of society they were hidden away — still resides.\nThey were forcibly removed from their homes, transported by boats and placed in shacks far enough from the US mainland to stop their disease spreading.\nFor more than 150 years people living with leprosy — otherwise known as Hansen’s disease — stayed at Kalaupapa, a colony for people suffering as much from their lost limbs as they did the stigma of their affliction.\nThousands of sufferers were sent there between 1865 and 1930, when they died, many were buried in unmarked graves.\nToday, only 16 social pariahs remain on the island. They were sent there shortly before antibiotics wiped out the threat of leprosy in the 1940s — and they have no intention of leaving.\nThough Kalaupapa brought with it so much pain, it was also a place of joy.\nPatients lived to old age on Kalaupapa, cared for by dedicated missionaries. Source: News Limited\nQUARANTINED IN PARADISE\nLeprosy was described in the Bible as “repulsive” and “unclean”. It was stigmatised and led to the establishment of colonies around the world for those suffering.\nThe disease was long feared to be highly contagious and its symptoms included skin sores and nerve damage. In severe cases, sufferers’ limbs became disfigured and deformed.\nTo ensure people with Hansen’s disease did not infect the healthy population, they were removed from their homes and sent to colonies for quarantining, far away from their families and friends.\nKalaupapa was one of those colonies.\nExactly how many patients lived there remains a mystery. There are roughly 1000 gravestones but experts suspect many more died there.\nSurrounded by some of the highest sea cliffs in the world, sufferers were greeted by missionaries from conflicting denominations who found shared ground in helping the exiled. There were Mormons, Protestants and Catholics.\nFather Damien, who would later become Saint Damien of Molokai, travelled from Belgium to the island as a young man to provide physical, spiritual and emotional support to the colony. He contracted the disease and died, aged 49, in 1889.\nBut the patients he cared for went on to live long lives. Some met and married other patients.\nTheir descendants grew up on the island.\nUnlike other colonies that were long ago deserted, Kalaupapa remains a thriving, happy community.\nA man named Paul Harada told Associated Press in 2003 he could never leave.\n“I’m all crippled. What am I going to do outside,” he said . “How am I going to live?”\nHarada was diagnosed with leprosy as a teenager in 1945. He was forced from his home on Kauai with five other young men and two middle-aged women.\nOver the years he watched hundreds of his new friends die. He said they were the lucky ones.\n“When I first came over here, the church bell was tolling every day, every day for weeks,” Harada said.\n“I kind of accepted that I’m going to come here and die here.”\nIt wasn’t all bad for Harada. He met and married his wife of 48 years at Kalaupapa. He and fellow patients ageing into their 80s and early 90s lived easy lives; they fished and read and watched television.\nSaint Damien of Molokai helped those suffering and became a sufferer himself.

YET\nKalaupapa was designated a national historical park in 1980, but when the last patient dies it could be opened up to tourism.\nNaturally, not everybody is thrilled with the plan.\nThe Atlantic reported earlier this year that a long term plan for Kalaupapa would lift visitation restrictions and see the island “fully opened up to tourists”.\nLindamae Maldonado, whose mother lived on Kalaupapa, told the Atlantic the plan to turn the island into a tourist hot spot was “appalling”.\nShe, like many others, is worried outsiders will ignore the peninsula’s “sacred” past and undermine its legacy.\nKalaupapa, of course, is not the only colony of its kind. Closer to home, indigenous Australians were exiled to Fantome Island, 65km north east of Townsville from 1928.\nMany lived their entire lives there, far from the prying eyes of a public.\nIts hospital was closed in 1973 but remnants of the island’s past can be found in graves belonging to adults and children.\nLike Kalaupapa, Fantome Island was marked for progress once the last of the sufferers moved on.\nA bootcamp for young criminals was the last proposal by Palm Island Mayor Alf Lacey in 2012.\nBut as for Kalaupapa, its time has not yet come. Its residents are not yet ready to leave.\nThey were sent there against their will, but they made it their home. Their forced exile became their paradise.\nOriginally published as ‘I accept that I’m going to die here’", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/31/1227464/835331-eb8b2dd8-366a-11e5-a64b-2779fb4d3b8b.jpg", "http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/former-leper-colony-turned-teen-boot-camp/story-fn3dxiwe-1226395795704", "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/last-days-of-a-leper-colony/", "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/05/when-the-last-patient-dies/394163/", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/last-sufferers-seeing-out-final-years-in-paradise-at-hawaiian-leprosy-colony-kalaupapa/story-fneuzlbd-1227464834961", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/31/1227464/834829-eee0ff30-366a-11e5-a64b-2779fb4d3b8b.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-01T02:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T13:34:05.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
