The Meetings Quest Opening Celebration at Plank, located on Oakland’s flourishing waterfront, will include a greeting by the Golden State Warriors Aftershock drum line. The following morning, the welcoming keynote address will feature Andy Dolich, the former president and chief operating officer of the Golden State Warriors. Dolich is the only Bay Area executive who has worked for Major League Baseball’s Oakland A’s, the NFL’s San Francisco 49ers and the NBA’s Golden State Warriors. Dolich will provide insights on how attendees can connect their professional lives to their passions in ways that will leave them whistling while they work.

The first Learning Lab Session will feature John Foster, one of the nation’s preeminent experts on meetings-industry law. Foster will provide clear explanations of the legal issues confronting planners and suppliers in today’s meetings industry. In the second Learning Lab Session, Larry Chao, vice-president of marketing at OneTraction, will examine how innovative social media and technology startups can help events and trade shows increase attendee and exhibitor engagement, while also increasing revenues.
