It was also influenced by a decline in catering services sales in France, Italy, the Netherlands and Finland where clients continued to cut costs. \nChief Executive Michel Landel told analysts he did not expect the situation to improve this year in Brazil where the economic slowdown was forcing clients to delay investments and where Sodexo was now working on cutting its own costs. \nProspects were no better in Chile where Sodexo had lost several contracts as clients were diversifying suppliers due to regulatory changes in local taxes and social benefits. \nSodexo manages canteens and facilities for office workers, armed forces, schools, hospitals and prisons and also sells vouchers for meals and gifts. Its clients range from the Royal Ascot Racecourse in England to the U.S. Marine Corps. \nSodexo said it now expected a rise of around 2.5 percent in comparable full-year sales, having previously forecast growth of around 3 percent. Its fiscal year ends on Aug. 31. \nIt still expects a rise of around 10 percent in operating profit this year, at constant exchange rates and excluding exceptional items. \nBy 0940 GMT, Sodexo shares were off 1.1 percent, recovering from opening losses of nearly 4 percent. \nRaymond James analysts said they were cutting their estimates for the 2014-15 financial year and cutting their price target to 83 euros from 90 euros. \nOver the medium-term -- the next 3 to 5 years -- Sodexo has forecast average annual revenue growth excluding currency effects of between 4 percent and 7 percent and growth in operating profit excluding currency effects of between 8 percent and 10 percent. Landel said he was confident Sodexo could deliver on these targets.
