In a statement, the security services provider said it reached an agreement with the employees that maintained \"their right to choose representation or not,\" and \"guaranteed a peaceful environment in which to make this decision.\"\nA strike could have had an impact on Delta Air Lines, which contracts the workers, although the airline said it was taking measures to ensure customers would not be affected.\nUnited also said it had contingency plans in place and did not expect an impact on operations.\nAccording to the union, Command Security threatened to fire workers who were seeking higher wages and benefits through union representation. The company has denied the allegations and said it is not anti-union.\nAt a rally on Wednesday, the union turned its sights to the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, which operates the airports in the metropolitan New York area.\n\"We're going to go to Port Authority and demand that they finally take a vote to raise the wages of airport workers,\" an official at the union said.\nThe interstate agency maintains that it has taken significant steps in recent years to encourage wage and benefit increases for contractors at the airports.\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T10:03:11.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
