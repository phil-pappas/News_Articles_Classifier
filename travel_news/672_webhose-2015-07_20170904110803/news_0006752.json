Ad Feedback \n\"We are monitoring the situation closely,\" Virgin Australian said. \nUnfavourable winds this week pushed ash from the Mount Raung volcano in Indonesia back towards Denpasar, forcing the closure of its airport. \nAsh clouds can choke jet engines and destroy bodywork. \nAviation expert Geoff Thomas says while the winds are blowing the ash cloud away from Bali, the threat may not be over. \n\"This volcano is continuing to erupt,\" he told the Seven Network. \n\"It shows no sign of abating and it really depends on the wind conditions, which way the wind is going to blow this ash, and so we could have the same situation in 24 or 48 hours.\" \nBoth airlines will operate additional flight in and out of Denpasar to help travellers get to their destinations. \nVirgin Australia also said it would waive fare differences for travellers booked to travel to Bali by July 28, but who want to switch to one of 12 other Indonesian islands. \nEarlier this month, thousands of travellers were stranded for extended periods in Bali due the threat of the ash cloud. \nStuff and AAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T03:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T08:51:06.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
