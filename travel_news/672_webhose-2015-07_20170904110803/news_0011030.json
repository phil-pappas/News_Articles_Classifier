The national UKCAMS Survey (prepared by RJS Associates) showed that delegates accounted for an estimated direct spend of £132.6m in 2014, up from £117.3m in 2013.. \nThe report highlighted Sheffield’s success in attracting association conferences accounting for 29% of business in Sheffield, up on 2013 and significantly higher than the national average of 18% in the rest of the UK. The news was welcomed by Marketing Sheffield which operates a number of long-term initiatives focussed on increasing business tourism and specifically around attracting association conferences. Brendan Moffett, Director of Marketing Sheffield said: “This is a strong indication of the success of Marketing Sheffield initiatives such as our Conference Ambassador Programme which specifically seeks to increase association conference business working with local ambassadors. “It clearly demonstrates the importance of conference business to the city’s economy and reaffirms why business tourism is at the heart of Marketing Sheffield’s strategic work. “Large scale conferences and business events also provide great profile for the city, allowing us to showcase both Sheffield’s fields of expertise and city vibrancy, to national and international audiences.” This news comes as the city’s busy conference calendar continues into the Autumn including events such as MADE: The Entrepreneur Festival, the International Adventure Tourism conference, The British Society of Neuroradiologists, the European Outdoor Summit and the British Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes. Marketing Sheffield’s annual Ambassador Dinner, which celebrates the individuals involved in the Programme and helps promote the recruitment of new conference advocates, is set to take place on the Thursday 18 November 2015 at Cutlers Hall.
