There were also reports of children running across the road, feces found smeared on bathroom walls and protesters taking souvenirs from the gift shop. \nKahookahi Kanuha, a protest leader, denied the allegations of bad behavior. He said he hasn't witnessed any of those incidents. \"Everything has been pono,\" he said using the Hawaiian word that can mean righteous or proper. He said that they value maintaining kapu aloha — respectful, nonviolent protest. \nThe troubling incidents represent \"a very, very small number of the overall people who have been up there throughout the months,\" university spokesman Dan Meisenzahl said. \"There are many examples of protesters stepping in and helping mitigate situations.\" \nOn April 21, the woman who yelled \"kill the haoles, kill the tourists,\" according to the logs, calmed down when visitor center staff asked four other protesters for help: \"They offered aid willingly and apologized for the woman's behavior and language.\" \nState officials say the rule is also necessary because the volume of protesters— hundreds of them at times — are damaging to natural resources and a strain on facilities. When the university closed bathrooms in the visitor center, protesters trucked up portable toilets. They were removed after the state threatened to fine the porta-potty company hefty fines for unauthorized toilets. \n\"We're a minority of the people that access the mountain,\" Kanuha said. \"There are much more tourists on the mountain than us.\" \nHe said the rule is a \"weak and shameful\" attempt to keep protesters off the mountain and allow construction to resume. Work on the $1.4 billion telescope has been halted since April. Crews attempted to access the site last month, but they turned around after encountering boulders in the road and hundreds of protesters. Dozens of protesters were arrested during the two failed attempts to restart construction. \nThe board could approve the proposal, reject it or adopt an amended version. \nAn inability to camp on the mountain won't stop protesters from keeping constant vigil, Kanuha said: \"The mountain will still be protected.\" \n__ \nFollow Jennifer Sinco Kelleher at http://www.twitter.com/JenHapa . \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T00:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T02:20:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
