This shocking figure has inspired some people to come up with novel ways to avoid the debt trap, and spend very little on day-to-day living expenses.\nFrom hipster freegans and foragers to savvy suburban housewives, frugal devotees are emerging from the fringe, with some living it up for next to nothing.\nEvent planner and masseur Daniel Ogilvie hasn’t paid rent for two years, instead opting to couch surf in between house sitting gigs and oversees trips, and counts himself as a pioneer of a new way of living.\nA member of the freegan community that centres in Melbourne’s north, Mr Ogilvie advocates an alternative financial lifestyle that is not dependent on cash, with a revival of the bartering system.\n“It’s an experiment in other forms of social structure,” he told news.com.au .\n“We’re so used to existing in a capitalist way of being, where money determines the value of everything.”\nWhile he does use money, Mr Ogilvie said about a quarter of his transactions were non-monetary, instead exchanging services with like-minded community members.\nAnd he believes the approach is gaining broader appeal, as “people are starting to realise it’s not about being a hippie”.\n“We’re starting to see more alternative ways of living popping up, because no one’s got any money anymore — and the money people have, is going into debt,” he said.\n“To be honest, we could all be doing this.”\nDaniel Ogilvie follows an alternative financial lifestyle as part of Melbourne’s freegan community. Source: NewsComAu\nMr Ogilvie’s biggest weekly expenses are public transport and the cafe meals he likes to indulge in.\nDumpster diving — trawling through skip bins to salvage foods that are still edible — is something he takes part in because he believes in reducing waste; “I don’t need to do it,” he added.\nHe said while the general public found the practise “f***ing disgusting”, the broader freegan movement was being embraced as people became disillusioned by “debt culture”.\n“If you only dumpster dive then you exist on the fringe of capitalism. Without capitalism and the waste it produces, you won’t be able to function,” he said.\n“It’s people like us, we’re pioneering new ways of being, which will hopefully one day be celebrated.”\nMelbourne journalist and frugal blogger Larissa Ham agrees that the low-cost lifestyle is gaining acceptance and popularity among mainstream Australians.\nAfter quitting her full-time job two years ago, the 38-year-old leveraged a number of ways to drastically lower her living cost while setting herself up as a freelancer. One of the major ways she built up a savings “buffer” was to rent out her apartment for 18 months while she moved around house sitting.\nSharing her methods on her blog Hey Little Spender , Ms Ham tapped into an audience hungry for ways to get on top of their spending, kicking it all off with a 30 day challenge.\n“I think people are not as inclined to have so much debt anymore,” Ms Ham told news.com.au .\nWatching what you spend had become more socially acceptable as “people are realising you don’t need so much stuff”, she said.\n“I think the word ‘frugal’ has a stingy feel about it, like the person who is the last to pull out their wallet and pay their share when you’re out to dinner. I prefer ‘bargain hunter’.”\nLife’s a beach: frugal blogger Larissa Ham now spends part of the year living in Bali. Source: Supplied\nMs Ham started saving when she was 16, putting away $3000 so she could go to Canada as an exchange student — that’s the equivalent of more than $5000 today.\n“I realised it’s easy to do if you put your mind to it,” she said.\nGood habits formed early in life allowed her to buy her first home, solo, at the age of 28.\nShe now spends part of the year living in Bali and rents out her Thornbury flat through Airbnb.\nThe strategies she has employed include slashing bills by switching phone plans and health insurers, ditching her gym membership in favour of free exercise, and renegotiating her mortgage.\n“I rang the bank and said I was going to change banks if they didn’t lower it,” she said.\n“They did it straight away.”\nLarissa Ham’s other tips include:\n• Skip the expensive dinner and drinks and suggest an alternative catch-up, such as a cheap movie night, a trip to the beach or a free festival.\n• Don’t pay credit card interest. Wait until you can afford something to buy — or if you can’t, always pay off your card by the due date.\n• Harness your existing resources so that you can make a little extra on the side. Rent out your spare room on Airbnb, or your car.\n• Jump onto new ideas early, like using Uber and Airtasker to get around or to have second hand goods delivered.\nPutting fresh, healthy food on the table for $15 a week just takes a bit of planning. Source: NewsComAu\nDespite the rising cost of groceries, Sydney mum Lisa Cahill feeds her family of three for next to nothing, spending just $15 a week on a bountiful supply of fresh produce.\nA washing basket full of seasonal fruit and vegetables appears on her doorstep each fortnight, thanks to a co-operative she founded four years ago with a group of neighbours.\nEight families who live near each other in the eastern suburbs take turns getting up early on a Saturday morning and driving to the Flemington market, to buy boxes of fresh produce at wholesale prices.\nMs Cahill estimates that the co-op saves her $5000 a year on groceries, and ends up with more than she can consume.\n“It saves us about $200 a fortnight, if we were buying that quantity of fruit and vegetables locally.”\nAnd, she said, “anyone can do it”.\n“We’ve got a closed Facebook group where whoever’s turn it is will write ‘don’t forget it’s market week, drop your baskets at my house. We leave the eastern suburbs at 5am and are back distributing the produce by 7.30am — it’s no harder than that.”\nEat That Weed’s Adam Grubb and Annie Raser-Rowland go foraging. Source: Supplied\nFreegans and foragers also rely on social media to swap information about alternative sources of food, whether they be supermarket dumpsters, overhanging fruit trees or weeds growing on the side of the road.\nThe Greater Brunsberg Freegan Co-op is an online and real-life community devoted to minimising waste, and is run through a closed Facebook group.\nMore than 240 members in Melbourne’s north use the forum to share information and distribute food collected in dumpster diving and gleaning expeditions.\nMessages posted range from dumpster divers showing off their loot — and offering to share it — to those seeking advice after an encounter with police.\nLess controversial is the Edible weeds and other useful survival information Facebook group, which is open to the public.\nMore than 7000 members post images of wild plants and swap information about their nutritional value, asking “does anyone know what this is?” and “is this safe to eat?”\nThey form part of a global community of foragers who have turned their backs on the idea that what we eat must come from a shop.\nThe uninitiated can sign up for an edible weeds walk in Melbourne with Eat That Weed or Hello Little Weed , or in Sydney with Weedy Connection.\nOriginally published as How to live on next to nothing", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/food/ginger-gorman-goes-dumpster-diving-and-actually-comes-out-with-a-good-meal/story-fneuz8zj-1227453826562", "http://www.eatthatweed.com/", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/28/1227460/845890-a95d7a54-3423-11e5-87b0-1caa04e25d62.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/28/1227460/860881-a908a18c-3423-11e5-87b0-1caa04e25d62.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/28/1227460/846024-5d6f9126-342e-11e5-87b0-1caa04e25d62.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/28/1227460/849113-1d38f76e-3424-11e5-87b0-1caa04e25d62.jpg", "http://www.weedyconnection.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/255804947779277/", "http://www.edibleweeds.com.au/", "http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-live-large-and-spend-less-the-secrets-to-frugal-living/story-fnagkbpv-1227460846052"], "published": "2015-07-29T05:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T20:15:48.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
