Supplied \nCoronet Peak ski field is enjoying some of the best conditions in years. \nThousands of people including many Australian families visiting New Zealand during the Aussie school holidays headed to the mountain this week. \nOn Tuesday, crowds at Coronet Peak were bolstered by skiers and boarders from The Remarkables, which was hit by a power outage that knocked out all the lifts and the base building on Tuesday morning. \nAnyone who bought a full day pass was given the option of a refund for a half day and season pass holders for The Remarkables were able to use Coronet Peak. Supplied \nCoronet Peak with Lake Wakatipu in the background. \nCoronet Peak ski area manager Ross Copland, who joined NZSki in 2013, said Tuesday was an incredible day. \n\"It was the single biggest day in our history since 1947. People were happy. We got some really good feedback. The snow we've been getting has been great. \n\"It's perfect timing. Supplied \nA boarder at Treble Cone, near Wanaka. \n\"The Aussie school holidays finish this weekend so we'll start seeing more Kiwis. It was certainly more busy for us because a lot of people came over from The Remarkables. They ended up having not a bad day over there [at The Remarkables] too.\" \nThe back bowls at Coronet Peak have been open since the start of the season, minus a day or two, and Copland said the back country conditions were exceptional. \nThe 280ha ski field has added a tubing lane and more terrain park features this year. Supplied \nCardrona Alpine Resort earlier this week. \nCoverage across the mountain ranges from 85cm of snow on the lower slopes to 185cm at higher elevations. \nSki fields in the South Island have enjoyed early snow dumps, dry conditions and cold temperatures making for powdery coverage. \nCardrona Alpine Resort general manager Bridget Legnavsky said it was one of the best starts to a season in her 25 years in the industry. The highlight so far was the quality of the snow. Supplied \nA skier at The Remarkables earlier this week. \n\"It's not just the amount of snow, it's the multiple snowfalls. We've got a really good base and we have wall to wall grooming. \n\"We opened a week early and we've had a great success with that. We've had a fantastic week with really smooth flows.\" \nThis year Cardrona introduced options for season passes, a premium all-season pass and a limited pass that blocks out the busy school holiday period. \nLegnavsky said this was introduced to better manage the ski field at or near capacity. \n\"We haven't been slammed or had any bottlenecks. There's way more space, lower injury rates and we haven't been hugely busy, which was planned.\" \nCardrona and Treble Cone, near Wanaka, have upper slopes with more than two metres of coverage. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T06:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T12:43:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
