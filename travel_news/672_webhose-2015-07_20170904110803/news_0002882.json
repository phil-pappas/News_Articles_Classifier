But this is its first US tour, setting out from Massachusetts with dreams of San Francisco ahead. \nAlong the way, it hopes to see some quintessential American sites, including Times Square, Mount Rushmore and the Grand Canyon. I have hitched my first ride, everything is hunky-dory!

Travellers can pass it off to others they meet, or leave it at a gas station or shop. They just leave it seated on its kickstand with its thumb raised. \nIdeally, the creators hope, drivers won't leave the bot along busy roads and will charge the battery when it runs low. Otherwise, there are no rules. Here is my final list, let us cross items off together!

It has a bucket for a body and bendy foam limbs capped by yellow gardening gloves and matching rubber boots. The whimsical attire is intentional, its makers said, to make it approachable and to deter potential thieves. \n\"It has a really low-tech look to it, something we dubbed the `yard-sale aesthetic,'\" said David Harris Smith, the other creator and an assistant professor in communication studies at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. \"The head is actually an acrylic cake-saver.\" As a bucket, I am making a bucket list of things to see.
