For Bjorn Pardo, his little break from school and soul searching has allowed him to find something that was working and immediately felt he could do something to make it better. \nCan you tell us a bit about how you started your career? What are some of your best moments in your professional life? \nBjorn Pardo, Founder and CEO of Xend \nIt all started way back in 2000 when I was in my second year of Civil Engineering and I knew that this was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life but I still was searching for my calling. \nI decided to take a little break, do some soul searching and finish up college in the US. While in the US, I took the opportunity to get a job first and make my own money while deciding where I was going to apply to school. It was then that I discovered this cool new website called eBay. It was amazing and I was hooked immediately. \nI was selling anything I could could get my hands on that had a decent margin on eBay, it was a rush. But I soon realized that shipping was a big pain point, it was such a hassle. I would spend hours of my day packing, preparing forms, traveling and waiting in line. \nI finally found my calling, I wanted to start my own business. \nI went back home, returned to school to study business, officially started Xend in my last year of college and I have been 100% focused on that since then. \nI am very proud to say that, despite being a relatively young company, we are the #1 logistics company in the Philippines according to Alexa, beating out other companies who have been around for several decades. \nJust knowing that we are helping more than 100,000 entrepreneurs and business owners run their businesses better is more fulfilling than any achievement I can think of. \nIf you could advise your 20-year-old-self today, what would tell him? \nI would tell him many things but 2 things stick out. \nFirst, I would tell him to not sweat the small things. If you panic and worry about every little thing that goes wrong, you will go crazy. You will end up achieving nothing when you could take those obstacles and turn them into opportunities. \nSecond, would be to trust in your intuition a little more. Nine times out of ten, you are right and the times that you are wrong, you just have to charge it to experience, learn from those mistakes and don't make the same mistake twice. \nWhat has been the most valuable advice you've ever gotten when you were facing challenges in your career? \nSomeone once told me that \"Opportunities are often disguised as problems\". Ever since that day, whenever I am faced with a problem or challenge, I take a step back and search for that opportunity. Sometimes it takes a while but I eventually find it. \nWhat would you advise the millennial just starting with their career or aiming to take their careers to the next level? \nMoney cannot and should not be your primary purpose. Find something you are passionate about. The passion does not have to be for the industry itself but a deep passion for something has to exist if you want any chance of success. \nIn my case, I am not passionate at all about logistics or the courier industry itself but I am passionate about building things, improving experiences, making a difference and helping entrepreneurs run their businesses better. That is what drives me everyday. \nEnjoyed this? Watch out for the next #CareerAdvice series, or let me know who else needs to be featured next!
