Thailand's first and only aircraft carrier is built to carry nine Harrier aircraft and 14 helicopters, and has a 605-person crew. - + A short drive from bustling Pattaya, Sattahip district of Chon Buri province remains charming, with clean beaches and an easy atmosphere. \nA seaman turns hesitantly when I ask how to get to tourist attractions situated at the naval base. He then calls his colleague who knows the area better. \n\"Drive through the junction and turn right at the T-shaped intersection. Then keep on going for 4km. Your destination is over there,\" he explains with an extremely bored voice, as if he has answered this question 100 times this morning. I drive through the junction but eventually cannot find the T-shape junction. After turning around and trying again three times, but still lost, I notice cars that passed me five minutes before going around aimlessly, like me. \nI am at Sattahip Naval Base. No, the base itself is not actually a place to relax but its untouched sands are attracting beach-lovers and the navy is kind enough to welcome public visits. On weekends, you can see a number of tourists driving slowly and hesitantly. \nAs the navy base is not a tourist destination, signage may not be sufficient in particular areas. So, I ask a seaman at the next checkpoint and find my way to the destination. \nAfter getting lost many times, I recall that most seamen in service here are not from Sattahip. They actually come from various places. They are relative newcomers here and that is the reason why they sometimes give wrong directions. \nAfter being questioned and getting the vehicle checked, any tourist can access the naval base's recreational areas. The security process may be a bit fuzzy, but the trip is worthwhile and you will be amazed that the beaches are so beautiful. \nWhile Pattaya continues to bustle with mushrooming hotels and beaches occupied by businesses, the coastline at Sattahip is clean and well organised. \nA white sandy beach stretches over a crescent bay. Bushes of thatch screwpine and other big trees offer shade to beachgoers who enjoy picnicking by the clear blue sea. It is Saturday and Toey Ngam, the most famous beach in Sattahip, has a relaxing atmosphere. \nThanks to the management, picnics here are quite easy and comfortable for the family. There are spacious parking lots for every vehicle, and no touts offering bike rentals or beach umbrellas. You can find an empty place, sit back and enjoy. \nBeach culture here remains very Thai. People carry everything to have lunch at the beach, ranging from mats and cool boxes to food and toys. After their meals, kids dart out to swim while adults take a nap. If you find the food stalls and grocery shops at the beach are not good enough, a kilometre away is the elegant Sak Pradu Club where high-ranking soldiers meet and dine, enjoying panoramic views. Tourists are welcome as well. \nIn the compound of the Royal Thai Fleet, a few kilometres away from Toey Ngam Beach, Dong Tan Beach is another nice and peaceful spot. A plantation of big sugar palm trees offers a shady area, making it a laid-back weekend destination with a number of sailing boats that dot the blue sea and amateur painters who enjoy colouring plaster figurines. \nBesides seeing the beaches, tourists love to hop around to enjoy food at the many clubs and visit the Sea Turtle Conservation Centre of the Royal Thai Navy. \nIn a bid to conserve sea turtles, eggs found in the navy base and nearby area are hatched here. Turtles are raised and kept for public display in a series of large shaded tanks. Each tank holds hatchlings of different ages. \nAfter visiting the centre, I get lost again. I try to find my way out of the naval base and dart to Chuk Samet Port to visit HTMS Chakri Naruebet . For sure, most tourists visiting the naval base would not miss seeing Thailand's only aircraft carrier. \nThailand ordered its aircraft carrier from Spain in 1992. Though the Chakri Naruebet has no aircraft on board at the moment, she has proved useful in rescue operations, including during the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami as well as in emergency evacuations. \nA short drive away from the port is Chong Samae San, where I find myself in a fishermen's village packed with seafood outlets and bungalows which welcome tourists who are seeking a peaceful beach holiday on the east coast. \nThe narrow lanes of Chong Samae San lead to Percula Clownfish Farm, Thai Island and the Sea Natural History Museum, and other hidden beaches. All are waiting for you to explore. \nSattahip is around 180km from Bangkok via Highway 3 or Highway 7 (motorway). A private car is recommended as there is no public transport to access beaches and attractions. \nSattahip Naval Base opens for tourists daily, free of charge. But foreigners are not allowed to get on board HTMS Chakri Naruebet. \nThai Island and Sea Natural History Museum opens daily from 9am-4pm. Visit www.tis-museum.org. \nPercula Farm opens daily with 20 baht admission for adults and 10 baht for children. Visit www.perculafarm.com or call 08-1313-6324. \nA sea turtle at the Sea Turtle Conservation Centre of the Royal Thai Navy. The centre plays a significant role in conserving sea turtles. Annually, thousands of hatchlings are released back into the sea. In 2011, over 8,000 hawksbill sea turtles and 5,000 green turtles from here were released back into the ocean. \nA girl enjoying Nam Sai Beach, an untouched area close to Chuk Samet Port. The beach is home to Navy SEALS. It has thatched roof shelters where beachgoers can relax during the day. \nToey Ngam Beach stretches for almost 2km. The beach is quite safe for swimming. There are shops, restaurants, toilets and parking lots. \nBoats as seen from Dong Tan Beach. The beach has a sailing club, playground, parking area and shops, toilets and recreational activities like painting. \nSituated on top of Khao Ma Jor Hill in Chong Samae San, Thai Island and Sea Natural History Museum consists of five buildings featuring information about Thailand's coastal ecology, seas, mangrove forests and conservation projects initiated by HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn. \nClownfish gather for food at Percula Clownfish Farm, in Chong Samae San. The farm has 30 tanks with species of clownfish and other interesting fish, such as leopard sharks, butterfly fish, rays and black-tip sharks.
