The coalition has the collective goal of engaging at least 100,000 Opportunity Youth – 16-24 year olds who face systemic barriers to jobs and education – by 2018 through apprenticeships, internships, training programs, and both part-time and full-time jobs. Additionally, the coalition will leverage existing collaborative efforts on the ground in a handful of cities to partner in building these pathways. The founding companies include Alaska Airlines, Cintas, CVS Health, Hilton Worldwide, HMSHost, JCPenney, JPMorgan Chase, Lyft, Macy’s, Microsoft, Porch.com, Potbelly Sandwich Shop, Starbucks, Taco Bell, Target, Walgreens and Walmart. \nChicago to Host First Opportunity Fair & Forum \nThe 100,000 Opportunities Initiative will accelerate the coalition’s hiring commitment with an employer-initiated Opportunity Fair & Forum for Opportunity Youth in Chicago on Aug. 13, where the participating companies expect to collectively train more than 2,000 youth and make at least 200 on-the-spot job offers, delivering immediate impact for their businesses, the Chicago community and many participating candidates. By partnering with local workforce leaders, the 100,000 Opportunities Initiativeexpects to hire at least 1,000 youth in the Chicago area over the next 18 months. Over the next 30 days, the growing coalition will continue to welcome the participation of new companies who share a commitment to hiring Opportunity Youth. This initial event will serve as a catalyst for hiring and training efforts across the nation with the collective goal of engaging 100,000 Opportunity Youth by 2018. \nThe Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership, working with LeadersUp, will serve as an aggregator and intermediary for the initial event in Chicago. The 100,000 Opportunities Initiative will also engage a broad collaboration of community based organizations to provide resources including on-the-spot mentorship and feedback, mock-interviews and skills training for job readiness, college prep, volunteer opportunities and internships. \n“The 100,000 Opportunities Initiative is creating a meaningful pathway to opportunity for thousands of young people – starting here in Chicago. With the right tools and resources, the next generation of Chicagoans can make a measurable impact in our community through civic engagement and strengthen our City’s economy. I am pleased that Chicago was selected to host the first hiring event, and I look forward to working with these companies to help solve a critical issue facing our neighborhoods and the young people who live there today,” said Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. \nThe Opportunity Forum will be hosted by Grammy and Academy Award winning performing artist and actor Common, who will lead an open discussion with more than 2,000 young people and their support networks focused on economic opportunity in America. Joining Common on stage will be special guests, entertainers and speakers. \n\"I believe in the talent that lies within our young people, and I know that when we give them a real chance, they will achieve and soar. I am excited to be a part of bringing jobs and opportunities to our great city,\" said Common. \nThe Opportunity Ahead \nIn the U.S. alone, there are currently 5.6 million youth between the ages of 16 and 24 who are out of school and not working. At the same time, there are 3.5 million unfilled jobs in the U.S. Jobs that do not require a four-year degree – sometimes called middle-skill jobs – make up the largest part of the labor market in the United States. For employers looking to fill these jobs, young, motivated workers are a vital and untapped resource. However, young people are often unaware that these opportunities are available, nor are they aware of the steps they need to take to pursue and secure these jobs. At the same time, employers often do not have clear strategies to effectively recruit, train and retain young workers. \nIn response, the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative is committing to create the pathways young workers need to build skills, attain credentials and ultimately secure a job. Companies engaged in the coalition will help to launch careers for young people who are just entering the workforce through internships, apprenticeships and on the job training, as well as to develop the potential of youth who have some work experience but are looking to gain new skills that will lead to a successful career. These companies have joined together and are operating with the belief that with the right skills and training, Opportunity Youth represent an unrealized pipeline of talent and an economic engine that can be ignited. \n“In America, your ZIP code should never determine your destiny. Breaking down barriers to employment for young people doesn’t just help the individual workers – it benefits entire communities and the economy at large. The corporate leaders championing the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative recognize that promoting career opportunities for youth is a win-win, and I hope more employers will follow their lead. I’m pleased to see the Chicago Cook Workforce Board leveraging public workforce system capacity to connect young people with employers, training, and good jobs,” said U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez. \nLeadership and Commitment to Hiring Opportunity Youth \nThe Aspen Institute’s Forum for Community Solutions will act as an intermediary for the initiative, building upon the existing work of its national Opportunity Youth Incentive Fund (OYIF). The OYIF currently supports collaborative efforts focused on Opportunity Youth in 21 communities around the country. The Aspen Institute will provide direct leadership, technical assistance, and programmatic support to launch the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative in a handful of those cities. Funders participating in the initiative include: Joyce Foundation, JPMorgan Chase Foundation, MacArthur Foundation, The Rockefeller Foundation, Schultz Family Foundation, Starbucks, Walmart Foundation and W.K. Kellogg Foundation. \nAlaska Airlines: Commitment to Opportunity Youth \nAlaska Airlines, a subsidiary of Alaska Air Group (NYSE: ALK), has a singular focus on youth and education, and is committed to building education and career pathways for youth in the communities it serves. By focusing on ways to expose youth to science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) careers through targeted giving, mentorship and other programs, Alaska is engaging the leaders of tomorrow and developing talent for the aviation industry. In its home state of Washington, Alaska has given $2.5 million to fund the Alaska Airlines Aerospace Education Center at the Museum of Flight to inspire the next generation of aerospace leaders, $1.5 million to Port Jobs for career development for airport workers, and $236,000 to the Highline School District for grants to teachers who help students excel in technical training.

Through that program, CVS Health has placed more than 1,500 colleagues in Registered Apprenticeship career tracks in retail pharmacy and management and has committed to doubling that number over the next five years. Another notable program is Pathways to Health Care. More than one million young people have participated in the program since it began in 2000. Serving students in more than 40 cities across the United States, the program has awarded over $4 million in summer internship wages and continues to be a valuable tool for high-school and college-aged students. \nHilton: Commitment to Opportunity Youth \nAs one of the largest global hospitality companies in the world, Hilton Worldwide (NYSE: HLT) has committed to impacting one million young people by 2019.

By hiring these purpose-driven young people, Starbucks believes it can create real pathways to opportunity for these new hires while driving its business forward and strengthening the communities it serves. Starbucks, the Schultz Family Foundation and YouthBuild USA have also launched the Customer Service Excellence Training (CSET) program, which gives students an opportunity to learn customer service skills - based on the same training Starbucks store partners (employees) receive - through classroom and on-the-job experience in retail or café settings. \nTaco Bell: Commitment to Opportunity Youth \nTaco Bell changes lives and makes a positive impact on the communities it serves. As the employer of more than 1MM teens since its founding, Taco Bell sees today’s youth as the heart and soul of its brand. They are the reason why Taco Bell, the Taco Bell Foundation and Taco Bell franchisees have invested $75 million in scholarships, programming and grants to develop the next generation of leaders. Education and skills development are one of the most powerful ways Taco Bell is building communities, and the brand is committed to creating more jobs that are compatible with going to school.

Taco Bell team members also have access to a variety of online options, including fully accredited GEDs through the National GED Testing Service; Associate’s, Bachelor’s or graduate degrees offered at a 40 percent discount through a partnership with Excelsior College; and programs where associates can earn nearly 50 percent of the credits needed to earn a college degree just by working at Taco Bell. \nTarget: Commitment to Opportunity Youth \nTarget has always worked to create shared value—doing what is good both for its business and for broader society. Since 1946, Target has given five percent of its profits back to communities, which today equals more than $4 million a week. One of the cornerstones of the company’s commitments has long been education.
