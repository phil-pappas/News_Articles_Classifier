Photographer's Note \nThis photo I took at the 19th December Square. This sculture was created by Erbo Stenzel e Humberto Cozzo and is part of the 100th year of the Parana State. The sculpture shows a naked man, made of granite, representing the Paran√° men looking to the future. The Naked Man sculpture have about 9 meters high. In the background a high relief panel made of granite too and created by de Erbo Stenzel. The panel shows important moments of Parana history. Sadly this pretty monument is covered with graffiti. \nNobody has marked this note useful", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T22:38:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
