This second certification has now been awarded for fulfilling the Existing Building Operations and Maintenance prerequisites Â– and it has made Hotel Verde the most environmentally friendly hotel in the world. In announcing the news, the hotel said that, together with its sustainability consultants Ecolution Consulting and Ecocentric building consulting, hotel management and staff were dedicated to developing a practical and effective environmental building philosophy that exceeded conventional industry practices. The features highlighted by this newly certified environmental policy include stringent waste management and procurement policies, a comprehensive series of corporate responsibility campaigns, departmental sustainability, as well as biodiversity maintenance. Hotel Verde had optimised happiness and productivity levels through the creation of an entirely carbon-neutral hotel experience for guests and an eco-friendly working environment for staff. Revolutionary hotel management solutions implemented by Hotel Verde were sustainable and focused on maximising the triple bottom line of people, profit and planet.

Andre Harms, the sustainability manager and founder of Ecolution Consulting, said: \"We had the opportunity at [the hotel] to look at everything from the ground up with regard to sustainability and efficiency with the commitment to operate sustainability.\" The new certification meant Hotel Verde was ready lead the way in optimising the operation and maintenance of existing buildings for environmental sustainability.
