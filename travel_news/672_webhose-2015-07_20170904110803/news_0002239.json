Courtesy of Ciclismo Classico \nBy Katie Rosenbrock \nRainforests, or jungles as we sometimes call them, are truly wondrous entities. \nNot only are tropical rainforests home to more than half of the world’s species, but according to the Rainforest Alliance , many forests also support our global food supply, serve as the source of a variety of medicines and ultimately, play a significant role in sustaining a stable, livable climate for the world. \nMost people today have little or no connection to rainforests, both tropical and temperate, which makes it easy to forget their importance, and also their mysterious allure. \nWhile these habitats and the creatures that populate them continue to face threats (the World Wildlife Foundation estimates that 46 to 58 thousand square miles of forest are lost each year, or 36 football fields every minute) many scientists estimate there’s still a significant amount of fauna and flora species left to be discovered. \nAs TreeHugger reporter Stephen Messenger put it, for biologists, this presents somewhat of a race against time. \nPreserving these ecological powerhouses is of extreme importance, and perhaps a close-up view — whether through real life or virtual travel — can serve as one of the best reminders of their all-encompassing importance. \nWhether you’re ready to set out on your next safari or simply want to learn more about the world and its rainforests, these spectacular ecosystems are sure to reignite your primitive connection to nature.
