Source: NewsComAu Meanwhile in New Zealand - Snow Fight 1:37 \nMeanwhile in New Zealand, skiers and snowboarders have decided to settle the score the old fashioned way with the most epic snow fight youll ever see. Courtesy: Air New Zealand News Corp Australia News Travel \nWANT the good news or the bad news first? \nWe’ll start with the good news, which is that despite a lack of early season snow, a decent number of ski lifts and runs are open across the Australian snowfields, thanks entirely to snow-making. \nNights have generally been cold and clear over the last few weeks, which is bad for natural snowfalls but ideal for snow-making — when a mixture of water and compressed air is sprayed across the ski runs at night to create the equivalent of actual snow. In the centre of the picture, the Mt Perisher “Towers” ski run which is open thanks to snow-making. To the left, the lack of real snow and the end of the loooong queue of skiers.

Not in the 60 years records have been kept in Australia anyway. \nThe current snow depth in NSW? It’s one centimetre. That’s right. A paltry centimetre of precious white gold. This time last year there was 128cm. The red line is this year (so far). Blue is last year. And bear in mind, 2014 ended up being only an average season. So this year is REALLY bad... for now. Image: snowyhydro.com.au. Source: NewsComAu \nOfficial snow depths in Australia are not recorded by a governmental body like the Bureau of Meteorology. Ski resorts provide a daily depth reading, but let’s just say there are vested interests at play there. \nThe only widely respected measure is put out weekly by Snowyhydro, the hydro-electric electricity generation company which measures snowfall because it needs to know how much water will be in its dams come spring. \nSince 1954, Snowyhydro has measured snow depth at Spencers Creek, a small tributary of the Snowy River about halfway between the two large NSW resorts of Perisher and Thredbo. Readings are taken at several spots along the creek, then averaged out. This is the graph for 1991. If you look closely, you can see that there was no snow until the very end of June, then it turned into a great season. So there’s still hope for 2015. Image: snowyhydro.com.au.

The previous week, the measurement was precisely zero. A nice arty pic of a ski slope with snowmaking snow at Falls Creek resort in Victoria. Note the snowless hills in the background.

Seven or eight centimetres of snow fell last Thursday, right after the weekly measurements were taken. That wasn’t enough to open any ski slopes beyond the reach of snow guns, but it was something. And it’s been cold, so the snow has mostly stuck around without melting. But much, much more is still needed. This image from Thredbo today shows the amazing job snow-makers have done this year.

Source: NewsComAu \nSeason 2015 actually started positively with 16cm of snow by mid May and good visitor numbers on the traditional June long weekend opening after another minor snowfall. \n“Resorts had a very good opening weekend, which really kicked things off,” says Neil Thew, CEO of Tourism Snowy Mountains. \nSki resorts are cagey on exact visitor numbers, but Neil Thew says visitors during the current school holiday period have actually been up on last year, when we saw those epic 2014 megablizzards . \n“It’s the trickle-on effect,” he explains. “Typically what happens is, if you get a good snow season one year, the trickle-on effect for the next season is good. Conversely, the same happens for next year, so it may be a struggle to keep numbers high in 2016 based on this year’s snow.” That, right there, is Australia’s highest peak Mt Kosciuszko with a very, very skinny winter mantle of snow.

Forecasts show a big, intense, snow-bearing system set to strike the Alps as early as this Friday. \nIf it delivers as some weather models predict, we could see four to five days of snow across all mainland ski resorts. There’s even a chance it’ll be one of the biggest Australian blizzards of all time. Hey sky. You need to do what those guns are doing at Thredbo. Got that? Good.

We’ll cross our fingers and keep you posted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T12:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T13:25:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
