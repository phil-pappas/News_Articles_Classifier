He decided to take a gap year after his A-levels and explains: “I chose to work instead of starting university because I felt like social and professional experiences were extremely important.” He ended up staying in London, where he took two different part-time jobs, at a primary school and a marketing firm. “In the end, it didn’t just teach me technical skills ,” he says, “it also made me realise what makes a team work efficiently.
