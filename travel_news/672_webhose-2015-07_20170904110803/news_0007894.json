Its low-rise brick warehouses with unobstructed views of the downtown skyline were seen as attractive and affordable for restaurants and residents willing to put up with truck traffic from wholesalers. But in the past year, the area has rapidly developed as not just a place to taxi in for a trendy meal, but to stay a while. Last summer, the West Loop got its first boutique hotel, Soho House Chicago ( sohohousechicago.com ), catering to artistic types working and networking in the area. The stylish 42-room building houses two restaurants open to the public, but most of the five-story former factory, including a rooftop pool, deluxe gym with a boxing ring and private lounge, is reserved for hotel guests and club members (the London chain restricts membership to those in “creative” fields).

The West Loop’s proximity to downtown attractions was enhanced three years ago when the Chicago Transit Authority opened an elevated “L” train stop on Morgan and Lake Streets, offering residents and visitors easy access to traditionally popular tourist areas of the city, including Millennium Park, home to video screen fountains and a Frank Gehry-designed outdoor theater. One year later Tremaine Atkinson opened CH Distillery & Cocktail Bar ( chdistillery.com ), a sleek 48-seat bar with views behind glass of gleaming stills that produce his grain-to-bottle booze. He said he got his long-term lease at an opportune time. Photo Pizza with burrata and black olives at Pizza East in Soho House.

Established hits include Next ( nextrestaurant.com ) from the chef Grant Achatz, which changes concepts each quarter; Girl and the Goat ( girlandthegoat.com ) from Stephanie Izard, who champions seasonal American cooking; and Graham Elliott Bistro ( gebistro.com ) from the chef who also oversees culinary operations at the popular music fest Lollapalooza . \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T14:38:53.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
