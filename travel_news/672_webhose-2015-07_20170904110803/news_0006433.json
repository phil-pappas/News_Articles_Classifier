Justin King, former chief executive of Sainsbury’s \nJustin King, a former chief executive of Sainsbury’s, will lead the review which was established in May by Thomas Cook Group chief executive Peter Fankhauser. \nThe review, which will also consider customer welfare, relations and crisis management, was launched in the wake of the deaths of Christi and Bobby Shepherd in Corfu in 2006 who were killed by carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a faulty gas boiler and the inquest held earlier this year. \nFankhauser said, “In May I met Sharon Wood and Neil Shepherd, who lost their children, Christi and Bobby, in a tragic accident on a Thomas Cook holiday almost 10 years ago. \n“In that meeting, I promised them that we would review our health and safety standards, as well as how we take care of our customers ordinarily and during times of crisis, so that no other parents would ever have to experience what they have gone through. \n“I hope that this independent review led by Justin King will play a significant part in supporting the change programme I am committed to implementing across the Thomas Cook business to put the customer at the heart of everything we do.” \nKing said: “I am delighted to have the opportunity to undertake this review. My objective is that it will be a key part of the Thomas Cook programme to put the customer back at the heart of the business, where they belong.” \nThe independent review will begin immediately and is expected to conclude in September when the findings, conclusions and recommendations will be published in full.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T14:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T12:12:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
