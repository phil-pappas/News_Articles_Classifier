The budget airline has also said that passengers who try to hide their alcohol or show any signs of anti-social behaviour will be denied travel without a refund or compensation. “Those who have purchased duty free alcohol will be asked to either place their purchases in their cabin baggage and into the hold at the boarding gate, or leave their purchases behind,” a Ryanair spokesman said. “The comfort and safety of our customers and crew is our number one priority.\" The airline claimed it had consulted with its customers and the airports before deciding to implement the ban. The ban is the latest attempt by low-cost carriers to crack down on bad behaviour in the air. Jet2 this week banned for life two passengers whose mid-air antics on a flight from Glasgow Airport to Dalaman saw them handed over to the Turkish authorities. • Mapped: the world's booziest countries Paul Strain and Kevin Brady were travelling together on the July 13 flight on which they were accused of consuming illicit alcohol. When they were consequently refused drinks from the bar, Jet2 said the party verbally abused the cabin crew. A spokesman said: “The obscene language, led by Strain & Brady, continued throughout the flight undeterred by verbal and written warnings from the crew. Brady sang loudly and danced down the aisle, stripped off his t-shirt and made vulgar sexual gestures, thrusting at a member of the cabin crew and then throughout the cabin, in full view of families with children. When firmly asked to sit down, he spat in the face of the senior cabin crew whilst physically blocking the walk-way along with torrents of verbal and threatening abuse.” • Police crackdown on airport drinking halves trouble on planes The men refused to hand over e-cigarettes that they had been smoking before landing and Brady was seen stealing wine from the bar. The pair, along with another friend Claire Marshall who received a six-month ban, were denied access to their return flight. Jet2 said it will be pursuing further action with the Turkish authorities and is looking at further action for these passengers on home ground. • See our guide to Ibiza's beaches Phil Ward, managing director of Jet2 said: “Aggressive behaviour will simply not be tolerated. Families and friends travelling on any airline should have an enjoyable time from the moment they step onto the aircraft. They should not have to experience aggressive behaviour, nor should our dedicated cabin crew. “These are clear examples, indeed some of the worst I have come across, of why we need a national shared database of passengers that have been banned for disruptive behaviour for the airlines to tackle the growing problem together.\" Friday night easyJet flights to destinations popular with young Britons looking to party are also notorious for being rowdy, with large numbers of passengers boarding who are already tipsy. A video of a group of passengers dancing and singing on another flight from Glasgow to Ibiza went viral on Facebook this week. The loudest passengers reportedly had to be told over the tannoy not to swear in front of children who were onboard. Last year, Monarch began sending emails out to passengers on selected flights warning them that \"cabin crew have a duty to control the amount of alcohol consumed by any passenger .” Telegraphtravel Follow @telegraphtravel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T15:01:36.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
