With four regularly maintained downhill tracks, Khao Hin Lek Fai which stands just west of the downtown area boasts more DH trails than any other hill of its size in Thailand. On my latest trip there, the local downhillers refused to bring me to our favourite trails. The reason being that there was, again, a brand new one, and they insisted I had to try it. Of course, I readily agreed. Why not? \nThe new DH track is also on Khao Hin Lek Fai. But unlike the other trails there, its starting point cannot be reached by the access road to the TV signal transmission stations. As a matter of fact, there is no road at all. You have to ride, push, carry or use any other technique you can think of to haul your heavy DH bike up to the hilltop on your own. The local downhillers assured me it was worth it. \nThe peak where the new DH track starts is in the northwestern part of Khao Hin Lek Fai, in the same area as the all-mountain track that I wrote about in this column a long while ago. It's also very close to Niyom's house. \nNiyom is a French man with a Thai name. His French name is Guillaume, but that is not as important as the fact that he is the one who built this new DH course, single-handedly. \nWhile the other riders called this Niyom's Trail, the guy himself has named it the \"G-Spot trail\", in line with the \"G-String\" all-mountain trail around the same peak, which he also played a big part in building. \"You can expect more of Niyom's trails in the future,\" he said. \nThe peak where the G-Spot starts is the tallest of Khao Hin Lek Fai, rising about 240m above mean sea level. To reach the hilltop, you have two options. The first is to cycle up along the G-String route and the second is to take the shortcut and just push the bike up the steep DH track. With not much time to spare before the Sun went down, we opted for the latter. \nDuring the tough hike, I got to see the details of Niyom's labour. The berms were big, bigger than anywhere else on Khao Hin Lek Fai, nicely paved and firmly packed. The jumps and drop-offs had safe and clear landings. In certain sections he even dug into the soil so riders and their bikes could come down smoothly as if flowing along a duct. \nYes, the downhill run was awesome. Too bad this is a trail you can't do more than once in a day, unless, of course, you're strong enough to bring your bike back up to the starting point. \nNext time I travel to Hua Hin, I'll definitely do it again. The G-Spot would be a great track to begin a day of DH riding before moving on to other trails where riders can be shuttled up on a truck. \nW ell, see you here again next Thursday.
