The doctor who conducted the assessment determined that the man was “morbidly obese” and therefore not able to fulfill the job’s requirements. The applicant alleged that the decision was discriminatory because, though he was overweight, he did not have any illnesses.\nThe doctor’s evaluation said that the man’s physical condition meant that he was 18 times more likely to die than someone of a normal weight for his age and sex, according to the statement. She added that the applicant was more likely to come down with any of several illnesses, ranging from diabetes and cardiac problems to hormonal disfunction and psychological problems, among others.\nThe Sala IV fell back on the technical criteria of the job as described by the Caja. The driver job covered several kinds of vehicles, from ambulances to light transport, which “implied that the current corporeal volume of the complainant does not correspond to the optimal functionality for the space allotted for these vehicles.”\n“The Sala [IV] considers that it is not possible to presume any discrimination against the complainant,” the ruling said, saying that the decision was based on the technical criteria of the job.\nAccording to 2008 data from the World Health Organization, more than 20 percent of Costa Ricans over the age of 20 are overweight .", "external_links": ["http://www.who.int/gho/publications/world_health_statistics/EN_WHS2013_Full.pdf"], "published": "2015-07-17T07:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T14:56:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
