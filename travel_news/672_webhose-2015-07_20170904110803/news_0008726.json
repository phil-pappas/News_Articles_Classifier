The Pergamonmuseum in Berlin (even if it is closed for renovations for several years) Zwinger Palace Dresden, Pinakotheken in Munich... The average visitor may never know that there is something much more bizarre just below the surface. \nBehold! Germany's weirdest museums.

The average German consumes up to 61 kg (134 lb) of meat a year - a not insignificant portion of that being pork. \nHoused in an old slaughterhouse, the Pig Museum holds the largest collection of pig memorabilia with over 40,000 individual pieces. Explore piggy banks from tasteful to tacky, gawk at the conjoined pig twins and read about pigs and sexuality - yes, really. \nFinish your visit with a visit to the biergarten and enjoy eating one of our tasty piggy friends with dishes like Schweinshaxe . \nAddress : Schlachthofstrasse 2a, 70188 Stuttgart Telephone : 0711 66419600", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T14:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T21:38:42.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
