The Hawaii Tourism Authority (HTA) continue to work with its partners to grow and maintain airlift, and through its collaborative efforts, projects reaching a record 11.9 million total air seats to Hawaii by the end of the year. \nThe first half of 2015 started off strong with year-to-date expenditures reaching a record $7.6 billion (+3.5%) and contributing $806.92 million in state tax revenue. While visitor spending is slightly behind target, arrivals are pacing ahead, the HTA anticipates finishing the year ahead of 2014's record-breaking numbers. \nTo strengthen its ties with the airlines and continue to highlight the unique attributes of the islands, HTA will also be hosting the first-ever Hawaii Tourism Authority Airline Summit, during which HTA leaders will meet with 15 to 20 airline network planners from across the US and Asia-Pacific regions. The summit will be held in conjunction with the 2015 Hawaii Tourism Conference, the state's premier tourism event, which will include informative sessions and workshops that provide insight, updates, trends, and forecasts for the state's lead economic driver.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T23:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T23:52:55.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
