When the motorway exit finally loomed above, I suddenly realised what Dorothy must have felt like when she made it back to Kansas. Unfortunately, what should have then been a 20 minute journey to my front door took twice as long, thanks to several scheming sets of traffic lights. Not that such conspiratorial signalling troubled some of my fellow road users. Blithely ignoring the signs to stop, they raced through one red light after another with unabashed aplomb. Highway Code? Nah, that's just for slackers (especially those of us stuck in a stuffy Volvo) • Please ban hands-free phones in cars. A fine won't do • Taxi boss: 'cyclists are the Isis of London' A cyclist swerves in front of a bus (Rex) What is it with some cyclists? Okay, not all of you. But at the very least those scary lycra-louts who regard the road as their own micro-universe. A place where they can duck and weave with impunity and without recourse to the law. Astonishing, really, when you appreciate the vulnerability of the cyclist when riding next to a hulking 4 x 4s (guilty) or massive HGV. Indeed, 19,000 cyclists were killed or injured in road accidents in the UK each year while in 2014 a total of 13 cyclists were killed in London alone. There's no doubt that cycling – when done safely is good for the nation. Indeed, a new report this week revealed that using the UK's network of cyclist-and bike-friendly paths helps save the nation £1m every day. • The truth about cycling safety Yet the enduring and rising appeal of the bike as a form of transport - more than a million people have taken to cycling in the past five years – has also given way to an appalling sense of entitlement, resulting in some pretty terrifying road manoeuvres. Practically every day, I witness cyclists taking the law – and their lives – into their own hands, be it zipping up a one way street in the wrong direction or weaving between road and pavement. Boris Johnson riding a 'Boris bike' with Arnold Schwarzenegger (Getty) Which is why surely it's time for the statute to be changed – especially with biking poster boys Cameron, Osborne and Boris Johnson raising the profile of inner city cycling. After all, we motorists have to pay insurance and pass a driving test to prove our road worthiness. Isn't now the time to make cyclists do the same? Or at the very least, beef up the law to stop the kind of dangerous hijinks practiced by so many of our two wheeled friends. • Cycling vigilantes are doing more harm than good According to road traffic lawyer, Michael Pace of Andrew & Co solicitors , part of the problem is that without a 'biking licence' cyclists can't be banned for poor conduct on the road. \"Without a licence based on a point system, how you can effectively penalise cyclists, save for on the spot fines.\" • Watch: Cycling vigilante who has secured over 70 motorist's convictions Katy Bourne, the police and crime commissioner for Sussex, did say last year that she wanted cyclists to have number plates to catch law-breaking bikers. Not that cyclists are entirely immune to prosecution. According to the 1988 Road traffic Law, the act of dangerous cycling (where the riding 'falls far below' what is expected of a competent and careful cyclist) carries the maximum penalty of £2,500. The lesser fine of careless cycling carries a penalty of up to £1,000, as does failing to stop at a red light. (Bloomberg) But Michael Pace says that in a 40-year career, he has seen, perhaps, two cyclists being prosecuted – one for riding on a footpath the other for going the wrong way around a roundabout. \"The biggest problem for the police or anyone involved in an accident with a cyclist who flees the scene is identifying them later. The law does need to make cyclists more accountable for their law breaking. Cyclists need to take responsibility for the safety of other road users as well as themselves.\" So why do cyclists behave in this way? Perhaps it's some ethical payback for the fact they use a form of transport which doesn't choke the environment. Meanwhile getting 'on yer bike' is open to, well, anyone. Only the other day, I saw two teenagers wobbling along on what appeared to be rickety death traps. In the absence of an MOT to ensure road worthiness and no palpable skill behind the handle bars, I gave them a huge berth, trundling slowly behind for fear of trying to overtake. And some cyclists can also be scary. Last month a toddler was knocked over by a 'hit-and-run' cyclist and dragged along the pavement outside her home. Caroline Marchbank-Caunce, a lawyer and partner in CycleAid which fights civil claims for cycists involved in road accidents agrees that it would be helpful if there was some kind of cycling proficient test before cyclists took to the roads. \"And I would certainly suggest that cyclists learn the Highway code .\" But suggestion is not the same as regulation. Angela is a recreational cyclist (Alamy) Before I go on I realise there will be those who will presume I have a natural hatred of cyclists (heard it a million times). Actually, I’ve owned a bike since the age of seven. And my husband is a fanatic. His bike is the third person in our marriage (though he limits his biking to off road). Admittedly my bike is for leisure rather than transport, so I restrict myself to flat coastline cycle paths or designated cycle areas. My favourite is Parsley Hay where there are miles of routes along old railway lines across across the central and southern peak district. • Cycling in Britain: five great coastal cycle rides No matter. In recent years the voice of the cyclist has become militant and unapologetic. Indeed when I spoke out about some selfish cyclists on a recent episode of This Morning, the storm on social media was fierce and relentless. It reminded me of breast feeding mothers, dog owners and all those others who believe their choice is an inalienable right which shouldn't be contradicted. @adepstein1 I was one of 1000s of 'selfish' cyclists raising money for charity on coast to coast at weekend. Shocking behaviour!!! — Gareth wall (@waalli90) June 22, 2015 @adepstein1 @itvthismorning *slow handclap* Ride a bike for a month then come back and tell us who the 'selfish' ones are. — Bellamyonabike (@bellamyonabike) June 22, 2015 It's not that I believe cyclists don't pay for the road. As research by British Cycling found, 87 per cent of cyclists also regularly drive cars, and so most cyclists have already paid the road tax. But surely, cycling is quite different to driving. That's why cyclists need to take a compulsory proficiency test and have an MOT certificate for their bike. And why isn't the wearing of helmets compulsory? Roger Geffen, campaign and policy director for CTC, The National Cycling Charity , doesn't agree with my ideas. Instead he thinks there should be a strengthening in road policing. \"With around 23 million people over the age of five owning a bicycle in England, a licensing and compulsory training system for cyclists/cycles would be complex unworkable and unjustifiable, not least because children have the same legal rights to cycle as adults and expecting them to hold licences is impractical.\" He adds that the benefits would be negligible, and the bureaucracy involved likely to seriously deter newcomers and occasional cyclists. It would, no doubt, take a brave politician to give the go ahead to changes in the law. Meanwhile, the rest of us will have to be content to see red. Though when it comes to the traffic lights, there are some cyclists who will always see green.
