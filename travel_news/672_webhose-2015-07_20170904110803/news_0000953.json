Throughout December, the venue – home to Brighton and Hove Albion Football Club – is running a packed programme of parties and disco nights, with music spanning the decades, including tributes to Abba and former Queen frontman Freddie Mercury. \nSodexo Prestige Venues & Events, which runs the conference and banqueting facilities at the stadium, is kicking off the festivities on 4 December with the first of a series of Disco Lights evenings. Held on Fridays and Saturdays in the run-up to Christmas, these begin with a reception drink, followed by a three course meal, DJ and disco. In addition, the stadium is holding five Nights to Remember events - with live music from a number of acts – starting on 5 December with We Will Rock You; a Freddie Mercury Night. Fans of Swedish supergroup ABBA will meet their Waterloo with the Mamma Mia evening on 11 December, while guests at the Casino Royale night on 12 December will be hoping luck is a lady as they take a spin of the roulette wheel at the fun casino tables. On 18 December, the Rhythm of the 90s will return by popular demand for an evening of dining and dancing while the following night, 19 December, will turn the clock back to the era of Motown, with live band, The Devotions, playing tracks from the 60s. The Amex Stadium is also opening up 10 of its function rooms – all with views over either the pitch or the neighbouring South Downs – to groups wanting to hold their own, private party for between 20 and 600 guests. Kathy Taylor, sales and marketing manager for Sodexo Prestige Venues & Events at the stadium, said: \"With fabulous, festive, food and entertainment in our state-of-the-art stadium, our customers really will have a Night to Remember this Christmas.\" Not only does the American Express Community Stadium boast its own, on-site, main line railway station, linking it to the heart of London, but it also offers complimentary on-site parking.
