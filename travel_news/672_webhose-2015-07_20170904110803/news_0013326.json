(Lynch, Rene /) Instagram \nFirst Lady Michelle Obama has lifted the ban on photography and posting to social media during White House tours -- meaning you can now snap and post to your heart's content while peeping 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. \nBut, sorry, you'll still need to leave the selfie stick at home. And no flash or video recording or streaming, either. \nThe first lady posted a video on her Instagram account to announce the end of the long-standing ban. A video posted by First Lady Michelle Obama (@michelleobama) on Jul 1, 2015 at 4:47am PDT \nThe video starts out somberly: \"If you've been on a White House tour, you may have seen this sign,\" a serious-sounding FLOTUS says in the video, holding up the \"No photos or social media allowed\" placard that greeted White House tour takers. \n\"Well, not anymore,\" the first lady says, and then tears the sign in half. That's followed by an outtake of Michelle Obama playfully imitating her sign disposal technique. \nDisneyland, Disney World ban the selfie stick \nWhite House tourists were thrilled with the change: \nIn the East Room, Michael Labrecque of Palm Harbor, Fla., was posing his sons Madison, 11, and Mason, 9, for a photo while wife Melinda watched on. \n“This is amazing,” he said. “I am very happy they changed the rule. I’m taking as many as I can.” \nMORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T19:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T20:08:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
