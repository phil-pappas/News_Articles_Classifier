The new brand combines the expertise and strengths of both ATP Instone and Griffin Travel and follows the development of an enhanced management team and wider rebrand of other divisions across the group earlier this year as part of the Group’s continued growth and evolution. \n\n\nAs a global business the ATPI Group has a wealth of experience in delivering highly specialised travel programmes for the shipping, offshore and energy sectors with teams located in all of the core regions of operation including Scotland, Norway, Houston, Africa, the Middle East and throughout Asia Pacific. \n\n\nThe new brand will offer clients access to technology that has been specially developed for the sector including a range of platforms that offer solutions for workflow management, end-to-end system integration and duty of care. ATPI’s Employee Tracking System (ETS) has recently been re-launched with enhanced pre-trip and detailed en-route travel data so that clients can review security and health information before they travel. \n\nGary Pearce, chief commercial officer for energy and shipping at ATPI Griffinstone said, \n\n“We have seen significant growth from our client base in the energy and shipping sector following the acquisition of Griffin. By combining two market leading companies in to one brand, we are confident that we will set the standard worldwide for managing travel in these sectors as we continue to invest in state-of-the-art technology. We believe that our service, savings and duty of care tools are leading the way in the travel industry and will ensure that these benefits are available to all of our customers.” \nSource:ATPI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T11:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T12:44:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
