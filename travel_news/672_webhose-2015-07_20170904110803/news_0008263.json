The new regulations allow smaller, non-designated airports to invest in screening services in order to provide passengers with connecting flights to larger airports, while enhancing the security of the aviation system in Canada. \nOn behalf of the Honourable Lisa Raitt, Minister of Transport, the announcement is being made by the Honourable Rob Nicholson, Minister of Foreign Affairs, at the airport in Niagara, Ontario, and by Jim Eglinski, Member of Parliament for Yellowhead, at the airport in Edson, Alberta. \nQuick Facts \n• There are over 200 airports in Canada that offer commercial flights, fewer than half of which are designated in regulation to provide mandatory passenger and baggage screening. \n• This initiative further supports the Government of Canada's Economic Action Plan to protect Canadians and support jobs and growth. \n• The changes to the Canadian Aviation Security Regulations, 2012 will be published in Canada Gazette, Part II on July 29, 2015. \n• CATSA plays a key role in ensuring the safety and security of all travellers passing through Canadian airports. \nQuotes \n\"By working with our partners in private and public sectors, we continue to strengthen the security and efficiency of our aviation system. In doing so, we are helping air transportation contribute to employment, economic growth and Canadian communities.\" \nThe Honourable Rob Nicholson Minister of Foreign Affairs \n\"Having a solid link to the main air transportation network is important to the local economy. The Government of Canada certainly supports these objectives, which help drive commerce and tourism.\" \nThe Honourable Denis Lebel Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs,and Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec \n\"Small airports like the one in Edson asked for the opportunity to provide security screening and the Government of Canada is proud to support their decision. This new initiative could make a real difference to our community.\" \nJim Eglinski Member of Parliament for Yellowhead", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T22:27:07.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
