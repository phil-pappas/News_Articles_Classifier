Accessible primarily to hotel guests (although a limited number of day passes are available to outside visitors ), the park includes water slides, a lazy river, and aquariums full of exotic sea life, all enhanced by a mixed theme of Mayan culture and the lost world of Atlantis. Top attractions include: Leap of Faith ride at the Mayan Temple section of the Atlantis resort's water park. © Atlantis Resort & Casino • Mayan Temple: Leap of Faith The imposing Mayan Temple at the heart of the Atlantis pool area offers the water park's most exhilarating slide, aptly named the Leap of Faith. This 60-foot slide feels twice as high when looking down from the top, and while \"flying\" down a practically vertical drop it's hard to scream because you can hardly catch your breath. The added enjoyment of this slide is that family members and fellow guests can stand watch on a bridge and listen to sliders attempt to gasp while hurdling downward at high speeds. It is a thrillseeker's delight. Serpent Slide at the Atlantis resort, Bahamas. © Atlantis resort • Mayan Temple: Serpent Slide The Serpent Slide, also part of the Mayan Temple, sends guests coasting through dark tunnels on a double tube. The spiraling ride drops you into a tunnel that runs directly through the shark tank inside of an aquarium, giving riders the feeling of perching on an inner tube as sharks swim within a few feet of you. The tube is fairly small and provides the a great vantage point for viewing your toothy neighbors -- it's a very unique experience. Side-by-side \"racer\" slides at the Atlantis Aquaventure water park. • Mayan Temple: Challenger Slide Challenger Slide features twin dueling slides sending riders at high speeds to a pool below the Mayan Temple; a time clock measures the speed of the each slider. This is a great ride for establishing bragging rights among families and friends. Boy on The Falls water ride at Atlantis. © Atlantis Resort & Casino • Power Tower: The Falls The Power Tower area of the park uses a water technology known as “master blaster” to propel people through the slides, providing an extreme adrenaline rush as a gush of water literally shoots riders on tubes through a slide at high speed. The Falls drops riders down almost 60 feet before the water currents pull you back through spiraling slides, then dropping you into a current of water. Dark tunnels reduce riders' ability to see what's coming next, adding to the thrill. Taking the plunge into The Abyss at Atlantis Aquaventure. © Atlantis Resort & Casino • The Abyss The most agonizing part of this slide is watching people in front you shoot down the dark, circular tube. After disappearing out of sight, the rider in front of you usually screams the entire way down until you hear a muffled splash. This is arguably the most exciting ride in Atlantis -- the equivalent of a true vertical drop that packs a lot of punch for 14 seconds. A true waterslide park aficionado will ride it multiple times before leaving the water area for the beach or lunch. The Current river ride at Atlantis Aquaventure. © Atlantis Resort & Casino • The Current Atlantis offers some relaxing rides as well. There are an abundance of fresh water pools and The Current, a mile-long river that wraps around the resort, curving through caves and beautiful landscapes. The ride uses a series of current systems to gently guide tubes through waterfalls, lagoons and gushes of small waves. Inner-tubes float at a slow-to-medium pace, so the one drawback to this attraction is that you may never get off of it.
