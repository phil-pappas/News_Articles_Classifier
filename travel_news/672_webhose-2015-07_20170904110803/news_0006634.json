On a cold winter day in 1999, as Kebir Tumer of Shaya county, Aksu, in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, walked his local street as he usually did, a baby's cry interrupted his steps. Walking closer to a dustbin from which the cry came, the Uygur man found a newborn baby girl in a cardboard box left in the bin. After no one turned up to claim her after half an hour, Mr Tumer took the girl home. The arrival of the baby delighted the family, but the couple faced a thorny problem – with only the husband working to support a family of seven, life would be hard if they had another mouth to feed. Mr Tumer suggested sending the baby to a welfare house, but his wife, Mairamhan, was determined to keep her at home, and the couple gave her an Uygur name, Belikiz Kebir. I am getting old and I am worried that if I die no one will take care of her “Belikiz is a little angel,” he says. “She is such a nice girl that she never said or did anything that made us angry for the past 16 years,” said Mrs Kebir. “Although we are hard up, we try to give the girl the best life we can,” she added. And when Mr Tumer was bedridden for years due to arteriosclerosis, the girl often kept her adopted father company and comforted him. To ensure the girl a good life in the future, the couple had made a will to leave their property to her. And their four sons are supportive of the decision. “Since my brothers and I have married, we fully understand and are proud of the decision made by our parents,” said Ahmat Kebir, one of the sons. Now that Mr Tumer has passed away and the meagre income of the family is not enough to support Belikiz’s higher education, the Uygur woman is looking for the girl’s biological parents or foster parents who would like to adopt the girl to give her a better life. “She will know [her identity] sooner or later... I am getting old and I am worried that if I die no one will take care of her,” said Mrs Kebir. She added that although she did not know why Belikiz’s birth parents abandoned her, she believe they must have had their difficulties, and that she would like to see the girl reunited with them.
