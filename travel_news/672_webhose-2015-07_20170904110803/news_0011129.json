I will be travelling in India July and August 2015. My husband and I would like to travel from Delhi to Rishikesh to spend 2 nights. I know it will be monsoon season and is not the preferred time. However, will it still be safe/worth it to go? If so, can you please recommend an ashram for intermediate western yoga experience?
