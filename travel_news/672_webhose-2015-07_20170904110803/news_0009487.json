Source: Getty Images\nMITCHELL Johnson made England work for his wicket - and that can’t be said for most of his teammates.\nThe left-handed batsman produced another back-against the wall fighting innings where re refused to be broken as easily as the Aussie top order.\nJohnson’s lower order resistance at least took some of the shine off England’s jubilant ride to a series lead.\nFrom Brad Haddin’s wicket with the Aussies at 6-122, Johnson led Australia to 7/223 before partner Mitchell Starc fell to a stunning group catch which ended in the hands of Adam Lyth at first slip.\nJohnson fell to the bowling of Joe Root when he danced down the pitch and sent an edge straight to first slip Adam Lyth.\nJohnson’s innings of 77 helped Australia to 9/242.\n12.27 — SHANE WATSON FAILS WITH ANOTHER LBW\nShane Watson’s oversized front pad was his undoing yet again.\nWHAT is it about Shane Watson that his teammates are unable to tell him not to challenge his LBW dismissals?\nThe Australian all-rounder was trapped walking across his stumps and again given out LBW when the Duke crashed into his front pad below the knee roll off the bowling of Mark Wood.\nIncredibly, despite being shamed for his first innings howler decision to incorrectly challenge his leg-before dismissal, Watson walked up the pitch to discuss the delivery with nonstriker Mitchell Johnson before challenging the verdict yet again.\nThe Decision Review System showed the ball would have collected leg stump and Watson’s embarrassing streak of perplexing DRS reviews continues.\nHis dismissal left Australia 7/151.\nJohnson and Watson’s partnership pulled Australia briefly out of its nose dive after the Aussies lost 5/25 to collapse to 6/122 in the second session of play.\n11.08pm — AUSTRALIA COLLAPSES\nSteve Smith has been sent back to the sheds. Source: AFP\nWhen David Warner fell just before lunch - nobody could have seen the collapse about to unfold in Cardiff.\nThe Aussies lost 4/9 to crumble from 1/97 to 5/106 in a weak performance that will have a lasting impact for the remainder of the series.\nBang. Steve Smith fell to Stuart Broad after he edged a good delivery to Ian Bell at second slip.\nBang. Michael Clarke fell victim to Broad again when he chopped a thick outside edge to Ben Stokes at backwards point.\nBang. Adam Voges edged to English keeper Jos Buttler off the bowling of Mark Wood.\nIt was Smith who should feel the most anger at his dismissal. There was very little he could do to Broad’s darting cutter.\nThe left-handed batsman attempted to push at it outside off stump but ended up snicking it to Ian Bell at second slip.\nSmith’s wicket left Australia 3/101 and gave England two wickets in seven deliveries.\n10pm — WARNER DISMISSED AT LUNCH\nDavid Warner was dismissed at a crucial moment in the first Test. Source: Getty Images\nDAVID Warner was beginning to make England more than a little nervous as he blasted his way past 50 - only to be removed on the final ball before lunch.\nWarner fell for 52 off the bowling of Moeen Ali to leave Australia 2/97 after an entertaining first session in Cardiff on day four of the first Test.\nEngland still leads by 315 runs.\nWarner was trapped on the crease by a ball that skidded on and struck Warner on the pads.\nAustralia 2-97 at lunch after David Warner's lbw.

He hasn’t followed the ball onto the bat. That’s why he’s not seeing it as well as he’d like.”\nWarner and Smith had earlier pushed their partnership past 50 from just 41 balls with Smith scoring 18 from his first 20 balls.\nIt included an incredible over against the bowling of Ali who conceded 17 runs in his second over and was taken out of the attack with figures of 0/22 from two overs.\nLIVE 1/69 \"A 50 partnership from this pair, it's come in the blink of an eye.\" - @mcjnicholas . #Ashes #WWOS pic.twitter.com/20o336tusU\n— Wide World of Sports (@WWOS9) July 11, 2015 8.43pm — CHRIS ROGERS EDGES TO SLIP\nStuart Broad landed the first blow for England.
