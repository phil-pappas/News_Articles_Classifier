Having had 4½ years to come to terms with its humiliating defeat in the battle to stage the 2018 tournament, the Football Association arrived in St Petersburg on Friday night hoping for a kind draw in the race to return to Russia. England scraping a place among the top seeds will certainly help but it is no guarantee of avoiding a nightmare fixture list, with Italy and France lurking in pot two, Sweden and Ukraine in three, and the Republic of Ireland, Turkey and Montenegro in four. If the worst does happen, there will be no repeat of FA chairman Greg Dyke’s infamous throat-slitting gesture from the draw for last year’s finals, with manager Roy Hodgson attending Saturday’s ceremony alone. Hodgson will do so none the wiser about whether he will get the chance to make amends for the debacle in Brazil 13 months ago, with any contract extension seemingly on hold until after next summer’s European Championship in France. He said: “Regarding my own future, I am fully focused on preparing England for the Euros and – like the players – am determined to make an impact on the tournament. Therefore, my mind is firmly on securing qualification and preparing well for France. “I’m not going to tempt fate by stating who England might want to play or avoid in tonight’s ballot, and, besides, that would be disrespectful. We’ve seen in the recent Euro 2016 qualification period that virtually all competitive matches are difficult.” Irrespective of whether he is still around when the next qualifying campaign begins, Hodgson was confident England would not blow a second chance to make sure they are among the 32 teams at the 2018 finals. He added: “We have a good nucleus of young players in the current senior team who could be a big part of this tournament and it’s our job at the FA to ensure they fulfil their potential.” TelegraphSportPage Follow @telefootball Telegraph Fantasy Football 2015/16 Get your first team free. £100,000 to be won Pick your free team »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T08:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T05:52:11.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
