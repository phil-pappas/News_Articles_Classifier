The arid landscape, the lush green rainforests, and the sweeping beaches are some of the most beautiful in the world. If you really want to see Australia up close, the best way to do so is on the road. Taking a road trip through Australia is going to be a life-changing experience for you. Not only will you get to see nature and wildlife up close, but you will also get to experience true adventure. From whale watching in the Jervis Bay to taking pictures in gorgeous inlets at Port Stephens, there are many things to see and do. \n\nHowever, before you can start, you will need to rent a campervan. Camper vans are small and very fuel-efficient. They are perfect for 2-4 people. Campervans are fitted with berths on either side that can be pulled down and turned into beds. During the day, you can fold the beds and sit on the comfortable seats. Many companies offer campervans on rental. Since the campervan circuit in Australia is so well-developed, this is a booming industry. The Apollo Campers campervan rental service is one of the best in the country. \n\nThe company has branches all over the country. Whether you are in Adelaide, Darwin, Melbourne or Sydney, you can pick up your campervan from anywhere. The company also allows you to make a booking online. Just put in the details of your trip and make the payment online. A receipt will be sent to your email. Then, all you have to do is visit the branch that you selected and pick up the camper van. However, when you go to pick up the campervan, keep the following things in mind: \n\nCarefully Inspect All Systems \nWhen you go to take possession of the vehicle, take a look at all the systems inside the vehicle. Go inside the living quarters and take a look at the kitchenette. Does the stove work properly? Check the microwave oven too. Then, take a look at the toilet and make sure that all the faucets are in working order. \n\nAlso, flush the toilet several times to make sure that it works fine. In case something isnâ€™t working, ask the guys to fix it for you or arrange another campervan. Since you are heading out on a long road trip, you will want to make sure that everything is in working order. \n\nTake a Test Drive \nBefore taking possession, take a look at the maintenance certificate. Make sure that the oil was changed recently and the car is in prime working condition. The maintenance certificate includes test results of the brakes, fuel consumption and everything that may affect your driving experience. \n\nOnce you check the maintenance certificate, take the campervan out for a ride. Listen to any sounds that you can hear in the cabin. Then, ask the maintenance guys about it. The most important thing is to make sure that the vehicle is in proper working order. ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T06:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T18:13:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
