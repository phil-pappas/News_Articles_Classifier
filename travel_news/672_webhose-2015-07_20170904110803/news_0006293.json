Lindy Drew/The Tico Times \nCosta Rica’s National Meteorological Institute ( IMN ) reported Monday that tropical wave number 15 arrived in the country during the evening and will increase rains overnight. \nThe wave’s effects were recorded first in the Central Valley and the Caribbean region with heavy showers and electrical storms. Several Caribbean communities on Monday afternoon recorded rainfall levels up to 55 millimeters, according to meteorologists. \nAccumulated rainfall in San José and Heredia provinces surpassed 30 millimeters and an IMN station at the Juan Santamaría International Airport in Alajuela reported 33 millimeters during the evening. \nThe tropical wave also is expected to cause cloudy conditions and intermittent showers throughout most the country in coming days, but mainly it will increase rains over the Central and southern Pacific regions. \nAccording to IMN forecasts, these regions will register rainfall accumulations up to 40 millimeters, “and even larger amounts in some communities.” \nHeavy rains also are expected in the mountainous areas of the Caribbean region and in the northern zone, with rainfall levels ranging between 20 and 40 millimeters. \nHigh temperatures will be recorded along the Pacific coastline during the mornings throughout the week, while cloudy skies will be constant at the Caribbean and Northern zone most of the days. \nTrade winds are expected to increase this coming weekend throughout the country and this situation likely will increase rains over most of the Caribbean region. \nIMN recommended caution in areas prone to flooding, and warned drivers to exercise safe driving as foggy conditions in mountainous areas will reduce visibility on roads in Limón and in cantons in the northern region.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T04:38:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
