Every day we each use around 150 litres of water, and that figure has grown by 1 per cent every year since the Thirties. Incredibly, just 4 per cent of the perfectly drinkable water piped into your home actually gets drunk. Almost a third of it gets flushed down the toilet, 8 per cent goes on washing pots and we use a fifth to keep ourselves clean. But by becoming water-efficient you can make big changes to the amount of water that goes down your drains. Try these simple tips to reduce your water consumption: 1. Turn off the tap while brushing your teeth - a running tap wastes more than 6 litres per minute. If the entire adult population of England and Wales remembered to do this, we could save 180 megalitres a day - enough to supply nearly 500,000 homes. 2. A bath typically uses around 80 litres, while a short shower can use as little as a third of that amount. When you do have a bath, you can minimise your water use by reusing your bathwater to water your houseplants or garden. 3. Before starting your washing machine or dishwasher, wait for a full load - you’ll be able to save money on energy and water. 4. Fill a jug with tap water and leave it to cool in your fridge. This way you don’t have to run the tap for ages just to get a cold drink. 5. Wash your fruit and veg in a bowl rather than under a running tap. 6. Using the lid on saucepans reduces the amount of water lost, so you don’t have to put as much in. 7. Water butts are a brilliant method to catch the large amount of rainwater that falls each year – which is of course free water. Have guttering running into one from your shed and use the water on the lawn and borders. 8. Mulch around your plants to hold in moisture – that way they won’t need watering as much during heat waves. 9. Sprinklers can use as much as 1,000 litres per hour, which is more than a family of four uses in a whole day. If you must use one sprinkler, do so in the early morning/late afternoon when evaporation rates are lowest so you’ll need less. • Learn about smart metres and find out how you can save money and time to spend on the things you love.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T14:58:39.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
