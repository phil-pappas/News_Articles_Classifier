Subscribe now to Photographer: Jim Courtney Robert Shankland, assistant manager of Hilton Garden Inn, said the downtown hotel scene… more If Robert Shankland had entered the downtown hotel business just a few years earlier, he’s pretty sure he would be in an entirely different position. Shankland, a 2010 graduate of Niagara University , in February became assistant manager of the Hilton Garden Inn, a Hamister Group property that’s among a half-dozen new sites in the downtown core. He came to the position after three years as general manager of the Hotel @ The Lafayette. “I always wanted to be part of downtown,” he said. “There are opportunities now for everyone to grow.” Home of the Day See All Homes of the Day In recent years, the city has welcomed hundreds of new hospitality jobs across all sectors, from housekeeping and restaurant jobs to front desk, sales and management positions. In the past decade, the leisure/hospitality sector added 10,000 jobs in the Buffalo Niagara metropolitan region, growing to 56,400 jobs as of April, according to the state Department of Labor. Growth in the downtown region accounts for many of those jobs. “This has been a growing industry for us,” said economist John Slenker . “Part of it was we didn’t have the growth through the ‘90s, and as our economy has picked up, they have added a lot of jobs and a lot of hotels.” Though there’s lots of competition, filling those jobs hasn’t been too difficult. Andrea Czopp is director of communications for Hamister Group , which recruited Shankland. She said since opening in October, the company has filled positions in housekeeping, front desk and even valet through advertising on its own website, as well as Monster.com and Facebook. “We’re not having any trouble really, and it’s good people, good workers,” she said. “Even before we had the doors open, we had people coming to the sliding glass doors. It was fantastic.” Educational organizations feeding the field have seen an uptick in recruiting, with a near 100 percent placement rate for Niagara University’s College of Hospitality and Tourism Management. While those jobs aren’t restricted just to Buffalo, the local market is a big employer of NU grads, said Kurt Stahura, dean of the program. “We have folks sprinkled throughout management at most of the properties around the region,” he said. “We support the locally owned and run properties, but it’s also pretty exciting to think that some of the multi-national companies are coming in, which provides access to these large organizations with career paths internationally.” The same is true for the Olmsted Center for Sight, which runs the National Statler Center hospitality training. The program, which serves individuals with vision limitations and other disabilities, has long provided graduates for the local market in reservations. Its newest program trains housekeeping staff. “We are getting more and more requests from local hotels to be part of our classrooms and meet our students for interviews,” said Jeff Hirschfelt, director of the Statler Center. \nWant Buffalo Human Resources  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T14:30:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
