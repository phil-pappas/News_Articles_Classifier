UBM, organisers of Care Show - the UK’s largest exhibition for those responsible for the care of older people – will take 7,000 sq m at the NEC for an exhibition with up to 250 stands and all 2,115 sq m at the Vox for an international dementia conference - their first collaboration with Stirling Dementia Services Development Centre, a world authority on improving care in hospitals, care homes and other settings. \nIt will be the first co-location event for not only the Vox but also in Care Show’s 11 year history, with UBM citing the proximity of the two venues as a key reason for hosting this powerful, simultaneous event in this new collaborative setting. UBM are partnering with the University of Stirling’s Dementia Services Development Centre (DSDC) who have created the International Dementia Conference to take place in The Vox. The conference alone is expected to welcome around 900 industry professionals across two days for plenary sessions, seminars and networking. Located in Resorts World, on the NEC site, the Vox is just a short walk from the NEC halls and offers five impressive, purpose built, fully-flexible meeting suites and a spacious foyer overlooking Pendigo Lake. Chris Edwards, Event Director of the Care Show Portfolio says: \"It’s fantastic to be able to run two important, complementary events simultaneously. The subject of dementia is very topical and with the UK care home market currently estimated to be worth in excess of £10 billion, the Care Show and International Dementia Conference will be an unparalleled opportunity to challenge assumptions about dementia care, as well as explore innovations. “Thanks to the venues’ close proximity to each other the conference will flow freely into the exhibition, allowing plenty of time for delegates to take part in plenary and breakout sessions as well as meet new, inspirational providers of services for those working in care today. “This really is a powerful partnership and it’s all been made possible because of the flexible venue space available at the Vox and the NEC. The proximity to each other and the accessibility to the UK’s transport network to make it accessible for all visitors – both nationally and internationally - have both been key factors for us. James Elston, Sales Director at the Vox, said: “The Vox is in an unrivalled position. Firstly, it is located in Resorts World Birmingham, offering delegates a wide choice of restaurants, bars, outlet shopping, an Asian themed spa, IMAX cinema, hotel and casino all under one roof. Secondly, it is located just steps away from the NEC, enabling organisers the opportunity to run powerful, collaborative events like this one. We’re looking forward to welcoming UBM to the Vox and helping them make this year’s event their best yet.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T14:55:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
