A new line would also be required in southern Vietnam to connect the main line from a point east of Ho Chi Minh City to Vung Tau.\nThe only railway in Laos at present is the short link from the south of Vientiane across the Mekong River to Nong Khai in Thailand. A ground breaking ceremony was held in December 2014 for a new 220km standard-gauge electried line across southern Laos from Savannakhet on the Thai border to Lao Bao on the Vietnamese border, while China wants to build a line from Kunming to Vientiane.\nTags: Ho Chi Minh City to Vung Tau , Korea Rail Network Authority , Laotian capital Vientiane and the southern Vietnamese , Seoul University", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T11:05:53.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
