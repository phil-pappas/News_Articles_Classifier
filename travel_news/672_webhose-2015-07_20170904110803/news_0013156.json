(AP) -- Bison gored a woman and tossed a teenager into the air in Yellowstone National Park, the latest run-ins with the massive animals during tourist season in the popular landmark. The National Park Service says a bison gored a 68-year-old woman Wednesday on a trail near Yellowstone Lake. She was taken to a hospital, but her condition wasn't immediately known. On June 23, a bison tossed a 19-year-old off-duty park concession employee who was off trail. She was treated and released from a hospital for minor injuries. In other encounters, the animals have gored a 16-year-old girl and tossed an Australian tourist in the air. Both suffered serious injuries. Yellowstone prohibits people from getting within 25 yards of bison or other large animals and within 100 yards of bears and wolves.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T23:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T06:52:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
