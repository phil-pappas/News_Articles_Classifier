But here's the thing: I'm usually a total mess before a trip, packing until the final hour and rushing to get to the airport on time. So pulling off a perfect blowout during that pretravel mayhem is often about as likely for me as sprouting wings and flying alongside the plane. When I heard that Warren-Tricomi salon was opening a quick-stop location in a terminal at LaGuardia Airport, I saw a potential solution to my travel-blowout problem, and I had to try it out.\n< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 3 NEXT SLIDE > © ALLURE STAFF The \"salon\" is actually two sinks and two chairs located inside an Xpress Spa in LaGuardia Airport's terminal C. It offers 11 different services, including a blow-dry ($45), trim ($89), and a deep-conditioning-treatment-and-scalp-massage combo ($30), all on a walk-in basis. The stations face large mirrors with good lighting and plenty of counter space. And instead of having a separate shampoo-sink area like most salons, the sinks are directly beneath the mirrors in front of the chairs, which swivel around and recline into the bowls.\nI'm pretty particular about my hair, and I can't say I had very high expectations for an airport blowout. But I was quickly reassured after my stylist told me that she had previous experience at a salon in Brooklyn. The rest was pretty straightforward. She washed my hair, gave me a quick head massage, misted some volumizing spray at the roots, and then went to work stretching out my hair section by section with a round brush as she blasted it with the dryer. The result was a perfectly adequate, well-executed traditional blowout: smooth bouncy, with a little bend at the ends. Not bad. I, however, typically prefer something a little less perfect and a little more lived-in-looking. But all in all, I was pretty impressed.\n© ALLURE STAFF The main downside to the entire experience was that, well, I was in an airport. Because I was seated in the chair right near the entrance, I was basically on display for everyone who walked by. I got a lot stares. But I get it: It's not every day you see a woman with sopping-wet hair who's about to get her hair done as you're shuffling through to your gate. A few people even snapped photos of me. (I managed to take my own photo of someone caught in the act, below. How does your own medicine taste, random airport paparazzo?)\nArguably the most impressive aspect of the blowout was that the entire process took less than 20 minutes. (I usually spend more time than that waiting in line to board the plane!) After my flight, my hair remained smooth and shiny. The best part? The blowout did indeed last through my entire trip—with the help of some serious dry shampoo—and I was free to think about more important things, like which Instagram filter to use on my vacation photos.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.allure.com/hair-ideas/2014/how-to-make-a-blowout-last-longer?mbid=synd_msnlife", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fAAd9cct%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fAAd7OCv.img&description=ALLURE+STAFF", "http://www.allure.com/?mbid=synd_msn"], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T21:18:00.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
