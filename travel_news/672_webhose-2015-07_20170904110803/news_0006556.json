Here we find out what they do on an ordinary day during Ramadan when they have to fast between sunrise and sunset. Yang Jie (pictured above), an imam in Hutubi county: busy helping his village become better off In Hutubi county, Hui autonomous prefecture of Changji, Yang Jie is a ‘fashionable’ imam rather than a traditional one. Although his 1.3 hectares of land have been put on the land conversion market, he is still busy helping religious people in his village become more prosperous. Yang, 49, is not only the representative of a traditional religion, but also a transmitter of modern culture. An imam for 23 years, he was the first to drive a motorbike, first to put TV in his office, first to use a mobile phone, first to drive a car and first to open a weibo account. When he’s not attending services in the mosque, Yang spends most of his time answering phone calls, checking his WeChat, visiting rural tourist enterprises and helping low-income families. Yang said it was important to introduce local rural tourist enterprises to neighbouring scenic spots. Five tourist enterprises have opened and six more are under construction in Sangonghu village, he says. Yang organises many WeChat groups to exchange economic information with villagers. Because it is Ramadan, more people are visiting the mosque and Yang says they will share iftar (the evening meal after sunset) together after the isha (night prayer). Happy and content: Ablikim loves gossiping with his customers and knows most of their names Ablikim Tursun in Hami city: a happy naan maker Ablikim Tursun has to get up at 4.30am and mix flour for the preparation of naan bread, which comes in large, round, flat pieces widely eaten in Xinjiang province. Two hours later he starts to make naan for his customers who queue in front his shop. He has been running his shop since 1999 but still enjoys his work and has a happy and comfortable life. He loves gossiping with his customers and knows most of their names. Ablikim says his naans have helped him make many friends. \"Although it is Ramadan, my business is still good,\" he says, adding that there are many Han people near his home who are his main customers. Big dreams: Football coach Akbar Salay has high hopes for Chinese football Football coach Akbar Salay in Atushi city: let more children's football dreams come true Akbar Salay rises at 7am to train schoolboys for a football match in Artux on July 20. Artux city is the home of football in Xinjiang. Everyone loves to play and Akbar, who is a football coach in an elementary school, has 30 youngsters in his squad. Every morning he invites them to breakfast at his home and in the afternoon he helps them in their studies. \"Six of my family members are devoted to football,\" he says. He hopes he can make more children's football dreams come true. Many of his students have been enrolled into the best local high schools. One is now playing for a professional football club in Xinjiang. \"I hope I can cultivate more football talents, and I hope Chinese football can go further,\" he says. Maytursun Maysadi, a peasant in Yutian county: a dream for a better life Maytursun Maysadi rises at 5am in heavy rain and his wife helps him load sheepskins on his truck. Then he heads to the Hetian wholesale market and picks up 150 cases of fruit before driving back to Yutian. He makes 1,400 yuan from the job. He has moved into a new home, sponsored by the local government, which only cost him 25,000 yuan. There’s a festive atmosphere in his house - there’s a red carpet, a red sofa cover and red curtains. He says: \"I am very happy after moving in.’’ • Read more about Chinese current affairs at China Watch This article was originally produced and published by China Daily.
