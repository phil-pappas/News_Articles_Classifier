The centre is across from the William G. Milliken State Park and Harbor. The state also manages Detroit's Belle Isle island park.\n\"The Outdoor Adventure Center will serve as a gateway to Michigan's out-of-doors,\" said Ron Olson, chief of the DNR Parks and Recreation Division. \"It will provide many unique opportunities to learn about the state's natural resources, the DNR's role in managing these resources and the many venues for outdoor recreation.\"\nVisitors can try off-road vehicle, bicycle, kayak, canoe and fishing boat simulators or an indoor archery range. There also is a life-size beaver lodge and eagle's nest, a 3,000-gallon freshwater aquarium and a waterfall with a 36-foot drop.\nChildren will be able to explore a cave and sit in an airplane similar to those used for spotting forest fires.\nThe facility took nearly three years of planning, renovation and exhibit construction.\n\"With natural resources playing such a vital role in quality of life, families are encouraged to explore the centre and then head outside to experience our state's natural resources, including its many outdoor recreational opportunities along the riverfront right in downtown Detroit,\" DNR Director Keith Creagh said.\nOpening day activities include the story of Harriet Tubman and the Underground Railroad, physical fitness and outdoor games.\nAdmission is $5 for adults, $3 for adults 62 and older and $3 for children between 2 and 12. Children younger than 2 are admitted free.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T11:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T17:49:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
