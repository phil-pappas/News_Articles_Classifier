He was flown to hospital for treatment. \nHis was the latest in a string of attacks, which started last month when a teenage girl suffered minor injuries and damage to her surfboard in an attack. \nSince then two teenagers have had arms bitten off in separate incidents while Wednesday’s attack was the third in the space of less than a week on the North Carolina coast. \nA teenager was left in a critical condition on Saturday after he was bitten on the calf, buttocks and both hands at a beach on the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. \nA day earlier a 47-year-old man suffered injuries to his right leg and lower back in a separate attack. \nYesterday’s attack comes just days before the July 4 weekend and has prompted calls for the authorities to close the state’s beaches over the holiday period, just as they were in the film Jaws . \nHowever, Florida Program for Shark Research director George Burgess said it was unlikely the attacks were the work of one shark, adding: “This isn’t a Jaws situation.” \nHe added the worst attacks were probably the work of tiger or bull sharks while the less significant ones likely to be as a result of black tip or spinner sharks. \nA number of factors are being blamed for encouraging sharks closer to the shoreline where they come into contact with humans and the attacks happen. \nBurgess said hotter than usual summer temperatures have made the sea warmer and saltier, which are conditions favoured by sharks, while more holidaymakers are hitting the coast. \nMeanwhile large shoals of herrings, a favourite food of sharks, have been spotted off the coastline \nBurgess said: “You have an unholy mix of sharks and humans in greater concentrations plus lots of bait fishes.” \nHe also urged local fishermen to avoid the urge to launch their own hunting parties against the sharks, adding: “That would be nothing more than an exercise in revenge.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T12:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T10:16:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
