Even meals at the institute’s restaurants were spent analyzing flavors.\nDespite all that focus, this was, in fact, a real vacation for Ms. Bolduc. Cooking, she said, “is something I really, really enjoy, and I got to focus on it for four days without thinking about work. It really gives you a better mental break, I would say, than sitting on a beach. I felt really refreshed when I came back.”\nThe Getaway Each week, Stephanie Rosenbloom helps travelers get the most out of their trips, with reviews, deals and tips.
