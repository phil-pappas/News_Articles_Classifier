From exciting cities to the great outdoors, the groups enjoyed a range of experiences, including jeep trips into the desert, tasting tours, hiking in national parks and exploring the USA’s music, culture and heritage at iconic sites and museums.The MegaFam took place from 14 - 21 May and, after six nights on their designated itinerary, each agent flew to Philadelphia for a finale in the City of Brotherly Love. The finale was a chance for agents to not only experience the sights, sounds and flavours of Philadelphia, but also to come together to share their newfound knowledge and experiences from across the USA.In this supplement we hope to provide you with itinerary ideas, selling tips and destination inspiration to help you deliver for your customers. And remember, by participating in the USA Discovery Program, Brand USA’s official agent training site at usadiscoveryprogram.co.uk, you can learn more and become an officially accredited USA Specialist.Thank you for selling the travel experiences across the USA. We look forward to welcoming you on the Brand USA MegaFam again next year. \nChris Thompson President and chief executive officerBrand USA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T19:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T07:14:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
