By completing various stay requirements, members were offered between 68,500 and 115,500 bonus points for their own accounts, plus up to 58,500 bonus points to share, or to keep for themselves. \nIt was complicated, and in many cases not very compelling. \nApparently recognizing that the promotion wasn't resonating with consumers, IHG this week augmented it with an additional bonus: double base points , for stays completed between July 15 and September 15. \nSo for the next three weeks, IHG Rewards members can earn the original \"Share Forever\" bonus—which amounted to double points for many members—plus the newly-added double-point bonus. While neither offer alone may be a game-changer, the combination makes for one of the summer's most generous hotel promotions. \nRegistration is required.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T01:57:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
