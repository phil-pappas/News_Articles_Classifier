Three of these employees performed safety-sensitive functions for three airlines when they were not included in the pool, the FAA alleges. \nAdditionally, the FAA alleges TAD failed to use a scientifically valid method to select two employees for random testing. One employee was allegedly selected for both drug and alcohol testing but was only given a drug test. The other employee was allegedly selected for drug and alcohol testing once but was given two tests during a two-month period. \nFurthermore, the FAA alleges TAD failed to use a DOT drug testing form to document one required test. \nTAD has been in communication with the FAA about the case.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T20:49:49.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
