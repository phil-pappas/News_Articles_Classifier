This collaboration will serve up new culinary offerings designed by Chef Stone, dedicated to fresh flavorful cuisine, ultimately creating memorable experiences as guests travel the world. \nInternationally known, Chef Stone began his cooking career at the age of 18 in his homeland of Australia and later honed his skills at Michelin-starred restaurants in London. He has appeared on a number of top-rated cooking programs, most recently starring as a mentor on Food Network's All-Star Academy and is host of the Network's brand-new show Beach Eats (premiering August 12). His first solo restaurant, Maude, opened to rave reviews in Beverly Hills, CA. in 2014 from respected outlets such as Time, Travel +Leisure, Eater LA, Los Angeles Magazine, Angeleno and more. Curtis is also a New York Times bestselling author, having written six cookbooks, his most recent Good Food, Good Life. \nGuests will be invited to enjoy three special offerings developed by Chef Stone, available only on a Princess cruise vacation, including: \n• \"Crafted by Curtis\" menu items available in the main dining room across the entire fleet \n• A new specialty restaurant concept and menu designed by Chef Stone \n• A special Chef's Table by Curtis Stone experience \nThis new partnership adds to the cruise line's \"come back new\" brand promise, designed to elevate the onboard guest experience. \"Crafted by Curtis\" menu items offered in the main dining rooms will debut aboard Golden Princess in the fall and roll out fleet-wide through the end of 2015. Chef Stone's first restaurant at sea will debut in December aboard Emerald Princess, sailing from Ft. Lauderdale to the Caribbean and Ruby Princess, sailing from Los Angeles on cruises to Hawaii and Mexico. The rollout will continue on Coral Princess cruising the Panama Canal and then Sun Princess, which will bring Chef Stone's restaurant to his home country, Australia. Curtis Stone's Chef's Table experience will debut across the fleet beginning in early 2016. \n\"We take tremendous pride in preparing and serving our guests freshly made dishes served with passion and care,\" said Jan Swartz, Princess Cruises president. \"This is an exciting step for Princess and sure to delight our guests since Chef Stone also believes that great meals bring people together to create lifelong memories, much like travel.\" She added, \"This partnership will appeal to Princess guests around the world and most certainly to those enjoying Australia-based cruises since Chef Stone hails from Oz and is incredibly popular in his homeland.\" \n\"Just the word 'cruise' puts me in my favorite mood – relaxed. Princess Cruises is known for visiting great worldwide destinations - I'm set on bringing a new culinary experience to the sea to enhance and complete a cruise vacation,\" said Chef Curtis Stone. \"Since I travel often, I know that discovering delicious food and sharing a great meal can create some of the most memorable moments and I've designed my restaurants with this in mind. It's important to me that guests have the experience that I would want and food that I'd be thrilled to eat myself, at sea or anywhere else in the world,\" added Stone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T06:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T11:02:55.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
