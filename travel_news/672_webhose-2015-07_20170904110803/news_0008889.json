It is a must visit for every travel buff as holidaying here is certainly fun and memorable. \n\nBijapur, now known as Vijayapur is a historic city of the state of Karnataka. It is the headquarter of the district of Bijapur and is about 384 k.m. away from Hyderabad and 550 k.m. away from Mumbai. The capital of the state, Bangalore is to the southeast of Vijayapur about 530 k.m. away. The place is just often referred as the \"land of five rivers\" for the fact that the city and the regions around are drained by five different south Indian rivers. The Bijapur district was also once the largest district in the state with housing 11 taluks. However, it loosed the title in 1997 when the district was partitioned, with only five taluks falling within the province of the district. Still, the district is one of the largest districts in the state in present time. \nToday, Vijayapur is one of the most sought-after tourist haunts in India. The old citadels, forts, palaces, temples, masjids, and other remains of old city generate lots of interest amongst history buffs, adventures, and enthusiasts of ancient Indian architecture. The city is rapidly getting filled by increasing number of visitors every year, resulting in a rapid growth of tourism industry in the place. The good thing is that although the place is yet to receive the influx of modernization but there is no shortage of Bijapur hotels. The large number of hotels in the city gives travellers multiple options to pick the best from and thus making the trip a memorable one. \nIt is believed that city was founded and built in 10th and 11th centuries. The Chalukyas of Kalyani were the erstwhile rulers of the place, who named the city \"Vijayapura\". The reign was passed over to the Yadavas following the demise of Chalukyas. By late 13th century the place fell under the reign of Sultanate of Delhi. In 1347 the city was ceded by the Bahmani Sultanate of Gulbarga, who were succeeded by Adil Shahi kings, Mughal Emperor, and Nizams of Hyderabad until the British East India Company took over the control of the region. Today, the city is marked by numerous remnants and relics of the bygone era. There are tombs, palaces, cisterns, minarets, arches, gateways, forts, citadels, etc. spread all over the place, giving the city a unique outlook and feel of medieval India even in the 21st century. \nAmongst the most significant historic sites in the city include: Gol Gumbaz, King Edward VII Memorial,Upli Buruj, Gagan Mahal, Ibrahim Rauza, Malik-e-Maidan, Mehatar Mahal, Archaeological Museum, Jod Gumbaz, Malik-Karim-ud-dins, Shree Siddeshwar Temple, Chand Bawdi, Asar Mahal, Bara Kaman, Saat Kabar, Green Stone Sarcophagus, Jami Masjid, Landa Kasab Gun, Sat-Manzil, Chand Bavadi, Malik Sandals Mosque, Shanmukha Swamy Matha, Parshwanath Basadi, Basavan Bagewadi, and Narasimha temple. \nIbrahim Rauza in particular is worth visiting. It is one of the most celebrated monuments of the city. Located on the western outskirts of the city Ibrahim Rauza houses two prime constituents, a beautiful tomb and a mosque that is surrounded by a garden. The Rauza was built in 1626 and the structures are the fine exhibits of remarkable architectural brilliance. There is beautiful fountain in the middle and the structures are adorned with intricate designs and carvings. Some also call the structure as the \"Taj Mahal of the Deccan\". \nSource: Free Articles from ArticlesFactory.com ABOUT THE AUTHOR \nDimpy Roy, a travel blogger, writes about best Bijapur hotels for frequent travelers.
