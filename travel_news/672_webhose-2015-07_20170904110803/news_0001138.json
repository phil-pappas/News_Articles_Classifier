Amsterdam is looking at implementing some of this technology. Source: Supplied \nYOU’VE heard of smartphones, smart tablets and smart TVs. Well, they’re small fry now, because an even smarter kind of technology is on the horizon. \nAcross the world, from Spain to the United Arab Emirates to Singapore, governments are working to transform their urban hubs into super-intelligent “smart cities”. The ramifications are exciting — and potentially dangerous. \nA smart city is easy to understand in principle, even if it’s a difficult thing to create. Devices throughout the city gather data, which is then fed back into a centralised computer system. The data is used to increase the efficiency of infrastructure and other services. \nSo, for example, imagine that data collection points are placed at every set of traffic lights in a city. They tell the central system exactly where the traffic is heaviest, and it adjusts the phasing of the lights accordingly. \nSounds great, right? Nobody hates smooth traffic. But don’t get carried away. Barcelona is one city that’s looked into the ‘smart city’ concept. Source: AFP \nThe Wall Street Journal summed up the problem rather succinctly overnight: “Smart cities will know everything about you”. The same data that’s used to create more efficient public services could be used for other purposes as well. \nPrivate companies already get their hands on huge swathes of your personal information, and smart cities would gather a lot more of it. And of course, if the government is running the smart city, it would also have access to your data. We don’t really need to mention 1984 here, do we? \nYou can see the dilemma. A technological revolution on the one hand, but a huge blow to privacy on the other. \nIt remains to be seen whether the idea will take off globally, but watch this space. The next city you visit may be smarter than you think.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T05:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T08:26:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
