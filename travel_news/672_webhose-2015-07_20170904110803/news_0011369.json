After careful consideration, Laura Page was declared the winner for this picture of Liam Page at Stonehenge. She receives a £250 voucher to be used towards a trip with Railbookers. But surely there are some even more cringeworthy holiday snaps out there? Don’t be shy: please submit your own to travelviews@telegraph.co.uk. More feedback from readers Skiing in the Seventies Reading Huw Edwards’s memories of his skiing trip to Le Mont-Dore ( Travelling Life , June 20) brought back vivid memories of a similar holiday I had in the same year, 1974. We also flew to Clermont-Ferrand on a Dan-Air flight with a school company called Hourmont Travel. We travelled to Le Mont-Dore by coach each day from La Bourboule where we had rooms in the Hotel Cosmopolitan. La Bourboule was a sprawling “village” below the snow line, and there was nothing cosmopolitan about the hotel at all. It housed just two school parties – ours from Enfield and another from Manchester. We slept five to a room, with one communal bathroom at the end of the corridor. There was no risk assessment, and when I became separated from the ski class, due to falling off the drag lift (a metal pole with a disc on the bottom), I had to side step up the mountain – only to find the class long gone. In the evenings we danced to Tiger Feet in a disco in the village. I wasn’t put off skiing by this early experience, however the total cost of the holiday (£65) would now only pay for half a week’s ski pass in a popular resort! Jill Torrens Carry-on baggage I hesitate to prolong the discussion on carry-on baggage, but Linda Clark ( Travel Views , June 27) appears to have overlooked a few points. Oversize bags are brought on to aircraft because airline staff do not check the sizes, and unless this changes, IATA can issue guidelines but nothing will alter. The proposed guideline sizes for carry-on airline bags are even less generous than those currently “allowed” by several budget airlines, such as Ryanair and easyJet. Under the proposed guidelines, my Ryanair case would not even fit! Peter Caspar Anguilla’s beaches I was surprised to read in the inaugural Telegraph Caribbean Travel Awards Anguilla did not come up trumps in the Best Destination for Beach Holidays ( Best of the Caribbean revealed , June 27). It has so many beautiful and safe beaches with pristine sand and seas. Elsewhere in the section this seemed to be confirmed: the Malliouhana Hotel in Anguilla was rated No ll in your cover story on The 50 Best Honeymoon Hotels and the accompanying write up stated that “Anguilla has the best beaches in the Caribbean”. Susie Walwyn Zurich high At least twice an hour, a clean but nondescript train leaves platform 22 in the bowels of Zurich’s main station. You emerge into daylight and call at well-cared-for platforms in the prosperous suburbs. After about 10 minutes you are in trees, and climbing steeply. After 20 minutes the little train comes to a stand in Uetliberg and you are on the edge of the earth. Even though you are still in Zurich, all Switzerland seems visible. Perhaps a gentle mist will make the rise of the mountains from the plains of the Aar even more dramatic. You have reached this summit for the price of a tram ticket. Unlike most mountain railways you might have the line and the view all to yourself in the early morning or late evening. For this is the Uetliberg Railway, one of the most astonishingly unknown great railways of the world. If you have a business meeting in Zurich next week, why not forego the hotel breakfast and travel on the 6:55, and have coffee at the top. You will be back in the real world well before 8:30, and will have an adventure behind you.
