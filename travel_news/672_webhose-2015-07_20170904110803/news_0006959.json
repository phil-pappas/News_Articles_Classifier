Residual delays were expected into late morning or early afternoon. \nAtlanta-based Delta says about 120 flights were cancelled; delays averaged about 3 hours. \nThe outage affected Delta's communication system, the jet bridges leading from the terminal to the airplanes and parking lots 4 and 5. \nSteve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the region's airports, says power went out at 4:30 a.m. when a contractor accidentally cut two electric feeders. \nPower was restored to the jet bridges at 8:30 a.m. and Delta's communication system at 9:45 a.m. \nUS Airways, which also uses the terminal, wasn't affected.
