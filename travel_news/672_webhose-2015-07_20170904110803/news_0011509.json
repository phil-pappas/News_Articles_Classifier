Then he went off on immigrants. Again.\nMeanwhile, Arizona's GOP Gov. Doug Ducey was firing off a press release called \"Why I'm reaching out to Mexico. \" It was about trade.\nDucey might consider one called: Why I want Joe Arpaio to Resign.\nIt would be about how the GOP likes Latinos. Really. They mean it. Honest.\nDucey just got elected. He doesn't have to appeal to the GOP base right now. So he's using his trust-me-I'm-from-the-Chamber-of-Commerce voice.\nAKA, let us trickle down on you.\nGOP Rep. Matt Salmon, who is running for re-election, has to appeal to the Arpaio faction. So he does photo-ops with the Sheriff.\nAfter all, who has more credibility than Joe Arpaio?\nHe presides over a law enforcement agency that failed to investigate hundreds of sex abuse charges. A federal judge found him guilty of racial profiling, and now he faces contempt charges for defying court orders. He'll go on trial next month as the U.S. Justice Department alleges he used his office to investigate, arrest and indict his political opponents.\nWho could doubt a fellow with credentials like that? Not the GOP base.\nI criticized Joe and Donald and was slapped down my some of Joe's fans, including this by e-mail:\n\"They both want to protect Arizona LEGAL citizens from illegal and dangerous people. Why do you think it is o.k. To come to our country the wrong way. Just because your name is Valdez, you think your race is not subject to the laws . . . \"\nMy race? Valdez?\nGee, whiz. I'm German-Irish.\nThis reader might want to get a job as an Arpaio investigator. They seem to have a similar who-needs-facts approach.\nArpaio was on the air to defend Trump, who launched his bid for the White House by saying :\n\"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\"\nThank heaven some of them are OK.\nArpaio was eager to defend Trump's first amendment rights. Me, too. I'll support Arpaio's right to defend Trump's right to degrade the GOP brand. Keep talking, boys. Hillary loves it.\nBut when these guys get going, it's time to think about a right to free earplugs.", "external_links": ["http://azgovernor.gov/news/arizona-governor-why-im-reaching-out-mexico-0", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/06/16/full-text-donald-trump-announces-a-presidential-bid/", "http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_ARIZONA_SHERIFF_RETALIATION?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT", "http://kjzz.org/content/160043/matt-salmon-stands-sheriff-joe-arpaio-announce-immigration-enforcement-bill", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/04/24/ariz-sheriff-joe-arpaio-contempt-hearing/26298133/", "http://www.wnd.com/2015/07/sheriff-joe-affirms-obamas-birth-certificate-fake/"], "published": "2015-07-07T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T09:00:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
