We are still keen to address this, but the current pontoon arrangement is fully operational and the situation is manageable.\nâ€“ Harbour Director, Sarah McGreevy Last updated Tue 30 Jun 2015 Travel Guernsey", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T00:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T10:51:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
