Lauren Leonardi. \nOcean Club West (also known as OC West) in the Turks and Caicos consists of seven three-story buildings surrounding a swimming pool and cafe. The property abuts Grace Bay Beach, a 12-mile stretch of powdery sand and ethereal sapphire water. \nAt OC West, guests have the comfort of a low-key condo rental plus the convenience of hotel amenities including maid service, a concierge, and an on-site restaurant. \nOC West's \"stay at one, play at both\" perk allows guests to travel between Ocean Club West and Ocean Club Resort, which are roughly 10 minutes apart. A shuttle departs every thirty minutes or so. Ocean Club Resort, the original property in the group, offers similar amenities, but also has two pools, one of which is close to the ocean. Guest Rooms at Ocean Club West \nPrivately owned condominium apartments, OC West guest quarters all have unique décor, appointed in the tastes of each owner while adhering to standards set by resort. Each unit has a kitchen, dinette area, living room, washer/dryer, and bedroom(s). \nHigh vaulted ceilings, large terracotta tile floors, and rattan ceiling fans make for a relaxed and easy if uninspired ambience. Beds are comfortable, linens clean. \nEvery apartment has a fully screened terrace. Windows in the apartment are louvered and screened. Crank them open for sunlight and sea air. If a sea breeze isn't your thing, windows can be close and the effective central A/C activated. \nFear not: You won’t encounter an owner’s clothing or toothbrushes in these condos. But you might find personal touches in these modest apartments that hotels don't offer, such as a collapsible drying rack on the terrace for wet swimsuits and towels. Dining at Ocean Club West \nFood at Ocean Club West is à la carte. Since meals and activities are on your own dime and there’s an American grocery store nearby and a fully equipped kitchen in your quarters, dining in is a budget-friendly option (although you’ll have to do the cooking). \nIf you prefer to eat out, Seaside Café is the aptly named on-site restaurant. It’s flip-flops-and-shorts-appropriate and open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner daily. The food, from basic American hamburgers to a decent local conch ceviche , is unpretentious and unremarkable. \nOver at Ocean Club Resort, the hotel’s sister property, there’s a finer dining opportunity at Opus Bar and Grill. Here travelers with a more discerning palette will also find a creative cocktail list and an excuse to dress up a bit. Vibe at Ocean Club West \nTurks and Caicos is a sexy place with surreal blue-green waters and sultry air. At Ocean Club West, an unabashedly family-friendly property, guests are likely to encounter families with children of all ages. So that escape-to-a-private island fantasy is a stretch. Couples can and do lounge in private screened terraces as well as poolside and on the beach. \nSince the resort is on the smaller side, the early morning chair-grab common at larger resorts doesn't occur here. There are plenty to go around. However, there’s no pool or beachside waiter service. You must walk to the bar if you want refreshment. Expect to see guests strolling about in swimsuits quaffing daiquiris in plastic cups and local beer in resort-branded cozies when not tending to young ones. Excursions from Ocean Club West \nAn entire trip could be spent lounging beachside at Ocean Club West. But if you feel like getting up and out and have a budget to spend, there’s plenty to do on Providenciales. \nGo Horseback Riding at Provo Ponies The horsewomen at Provo Ponies wisely pair riders and horses with compatible temperaments. The experience is the stuff of fairy tales: It begins with a brief dusty stroll down a paved road, onto the beach, and into the ethereal blue water. Horses walk along in the water, snacking on seaweed. Riders get wet up to your knees. (Provo Ponies will provide sneakers for those who prefer not to get theirs wet.) It’s an easy ride, and an opportunity not to be misses. The horses are handled with respect by their caregivers, and as such are patient even with inexperienced riders. \nKayak or Stand-Up Paddle with Big Blue Tours Start early, and explore the shallow waters and mangrove channels of the Turks and Caicos Islands. Head across a channel to Iguana Island, a small swath of land inhabited mostly by rare Caribbean lizards. Ask your guide to point out the local fauna. \nSail the Atabeyra with Suncharters This former trading schooner turned traditionally rigged sailboat can carry as few as two and as many as forty passengers, and the route follows wherever passengers might like to go. Start with some midday snorkeling. Then head surfside to a nearly uninhabited beach for starfish-marveling. Sail home as the sun sets. \nGamble at Casablanca Casino The small casino is a few minutes' drive from OC West and has table games and a few machines. Smoking is permitted. \nVisit Da Conch Shack for Lunch with a View If you say you’re going to Turks and Caicos, someone will usually say, “Go to Da Conch Shack.” Listen to that advice. Guests sit at picnic tables, feet in the sand, and watch as lunch is pulled straight from the sea. Locals eat here, too. Always a good sign. \nAttend the Island Fish Fry Every Thursday evening, Provo (Providenciales) hosts its Island Fish Fry. Vendors of all types, as well as local musicians, set up beachside. Although it’s billed as the “destination’s most popular cultural experience,” there are usually more tourists than locals. It may not represent an entirely authentic island culture, but it’s a good time nevertheless. Destination Weddings at Ocean Club West \nOcean Club Resort offers a wedding package at a relatively affordable price. A wedding planner will assist a bride, the groom, and up to ten guests in creating a wedding with either a beach or garden setting. The package includes a minister or justice of the peace to perform the wedding ceremony, a bougainvillea bridal bouquet, and a matching groom’s boutonniere. The package also includes a choice of wedding cake or champagne toast after the ceremony. Inquire when booking as to whether free honeymoon nights will be included. \nThe property will process the required legal documentation on the couple's behalf and obtain and mail their marriage certificate. The resort can also provide a witness, if needed. Drawbacks at Ocean Club West \nThere's nothing exotic about the property, which makes it easy to forget you're in a foreign country, on a tiny island, in a string of tiny islands , in the middle of the ocean. Ocean Club West is squarely on the beaten path. \nThe property is clean and pleasant with well-clipped hedges and basic landscaping. A circular concrete fountain near the center of the resort lends an air of festivity, but also brings to mind the impersonal functionality of a municipal playground. \nThere's not much privacy in the public spaces. No nooks and crannies here. Whether on the beach, poolside, or just relaxing on the property, you're likely to encounter other people's music (sometimes), other people's cigarette smoke (occasionally), and other people's children (often).
