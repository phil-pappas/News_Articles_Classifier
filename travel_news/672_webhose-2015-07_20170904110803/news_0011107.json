That wasn’t an issue, however, for the incarnation of Fort Knox Five that ran the decks Friday night at U Street Music Hall. DJs Jon Horvath and Steve Raskin danced around any possible monotony with an improvisational set that was boosted by a clear and energetic trajectory.\nThe two-hour set was the D.C. group’s fifth annual “Big Boom” pre-Fourth of July party at the venue and also a record-release show for its recent “ Pressurize the Cabin .” Yet the album, made by all four of the Five’s members, exists in a parallel universe from Horvath and Raskin’s DJ sets. When recording, the group works in the same mode as Thievery Corporation, for which the Five’s Rob Myers plays guitar; the musicians tailor their productions to a series of guest stars. While the Five’s bedrock style stresses ’70s funk and ’80s hip-hop, the latest album ventures into jump jazz (with Flex Mathews), Latin rap (with the Empresarios), ska (with Sleepy Wonder) and Bollywood-style funk.\nThe Five occasionally performs live in a full-band format, but more often its public appearances are Horvath and Raskin DJ sets. These include songs from the group’s albums, but generally in altered states. While such “Pressurize the Cabin” tracks as “ Keep It Poppin ” and the go-go-imbued “ Whatcha Gonna Do ” were featured Friday night, they arrived in remixed or stripped-back versions that allowed for live mixing.\nThe two DJs alternated remixes of their group’s own material with its reworkings of other performers’ material. Occasionally, the tracks featured pieces of widely recognizable songs, including Wild Cherry’s 1976 “ Play That Funky Music ” and Manu Dibango’s 1972 “ Soul Makossa ,” whose vocal hook was borrowed by Michael Jackson’s “ Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’ .”\nHorvath and Raskin’s forays are billed as “4 turntable DJ sets,” but their gear is a bit more complicated than that. The Fort Knox two use Serato DJ software, which allows the scratching and stuttering effects originally made with vinyl even if the audio source is a CD or digital file. Horvath often plays stark instrumental tracks to which Raskin adds electronic flourishes and snippets of vocals.\nThe duo began in old-school mode, heavy on the beats and chants of yesterday’s hip-hop and those conga flurries disco took from salsa. Gradually, the arrangements got starker, the beats faster and the subwoofers more assertive as the music shifted toward the style of the man who was up next. At midnight, when Horvath and Raskin turned over the booth, they’d journeyed from Fort Knox’s funk vaults to DJ Dan’s house.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2jYjUiulMQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Uj3zitETs4", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltHlaBcXu5o", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00U9RQORM", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8WdMzeg_qU", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWG2MVP4m1k"], "published": "2015-07-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T00:32:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
