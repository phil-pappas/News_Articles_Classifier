On the night of June 16, torrential rain flooded Shanghai's northern districts, crippling the city's transportation network as vehicles stalled in floodwater and pedestrians were forced to roll up their trousers and wade through the deluge. Students at Tongji and Fudan universities, both located in Shanghai, managed to find a little fun when goldfish escaped from the flooded ornamental ponds on campus, and a fishing contest ensued as the students tried to catch and return the fish. At Fudan University, students had no alternative but to trudge to classes through the high water and heavy rain, leading senior student Su Yiwei to lambast the school, which she said should have responded to the conditions more effectively. “In such a scenario, the university should establish an emergency response plan and cancel classes in time,” she said. Yang Zhenghong, an official with the school assets department at Tongji University, said continuing construction work near the university campus has reduced the efficiency of the college's drainage system. “The base height of the roads around the campus has continued to rise along with the urban construction drive, especially the building of new rail transit lines. Our drainage system cannot cope in times of heavy rain,” he told China Central Television. In recent years, summer floods have disrupted other campuses, including universities in Wuhan, Nanjing and Xiamen. Students pose for photographs at Tongji University after rain flooded the city Although they have dominated the headlines, Shanghai, Nanjing and Wuhan are just three of more than 100 cities across China that are disrupted by urban flooding every year, according to the state flood control and drought relief headquarters. In 2012, urban flooding affected 184 cities, while in 2013 the number was 234, and last year it was 125, it said. Zhang Jiatuan, a spokesman for the authority, said local governments have failed to pay sufficient attention to drainage systems, which has led to regular floods in a large number of cities. “For a long time, local authorities have paid too much attention to 'above-ground' construction projects, which are highly visible political achievements, and have ignored factors that aren't usually seen, including the drainage systems,” he said. Failure to meet standards More than 300 of China's 657 cities fail to reach the national standards for flood prevention in urban areas, and more than 90 per cent of older urban areas do not even meet the lowest criteria for flood prevention, according to Zhang. “Urban flooding will only get more serious if we continue to ignore the construction of drainage systems and sewers,” he said. Liu Bo, an official with the office of environmental sanitation in Changde, Hunan province, who is one of the country's leading authorities on low-impact development, said many cities have to rely on pumping stations to drain storm water, mainly as a result of poorly designed and maintained drainage systems. “The urbanisation drive, especially the construction of large areas of land with impervious surfaces, has made storm drainage virtually impossible. The storm water run-off stays on the surface and then converges into floods,” he said. Liu also said that local authorities have largely ignored the construction of drainage systems amid the urbanisation drive, adding that urbanisation and construction have resulted in huge areas being covered over with impervious materials, such as tarmac, which prevent excess water from draining into the soil. Learning harsh lessons In recent years, a number of cities, including Beijing, have learned difficult lessons in urban flooding during the rainy seasons. On July 21, 2012, Beijing was inundated by its heaviest rainstorm in 60 years. The downpour resulted in 79 deaths, caused economic losses estimated at 10 billion yuan ($1.61 billion), crippled the transport network and left thousands of homes flooded. This year, the Beijing municipal authority has taken to using social media, including popular sites such as Sina Weibo and WeChat, to warn residents of possible flooding. The authority will also expand the monitoring of flooded roads to the city's suburbs. According to Zhang, the development of an effective early-warning system is the most effective measure to reduce losses and casualties caused by urban flooding. “The co-ordination of government departments is key. Flood prevention requires input from multiple government departments, so we must formulate an effective plan that will enable them to share information and co-ordinate effectively,” he said. Greater and more effective information-sharing would also enable the emergency services and equipment to be directed to the areas where they are most needed, he added. A car is dragged from the water in Beijing in 2012 after a flood In Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, the waters of the Yangtze River, which flows through the city, have risen higher than ground level during the flood season, which has left the city's old drainage systems unable to cope, said Zhang Wenchun, head of the Luojiahu pump station under the Wuhan water resources bureau. “We had to put all our 11 pumps to work when rainstorms have occurred,” he said. The local water resources authorities have identified all the sections of road within the city where the storm water run-off converges and stagnates. “One of our most important jobs is to send out timely warnings to residents to stay away from those sections [of road],” said Zhang Yuntian, director of the flood control information centre at the Wuhan water resources bureau. He said the bureau has employed the police video surveillance system to monitor water levels on roads so residents can be given accurate information about conditions. Green drive One of the most effective measures to increase the efficiency of storm drains in cities would be to reduce the storm-water run-off and raise the levels of water filtration and conservation in urban areas, experts said. To solve the problem of urban flooding once and for all, the central government has decided to push forward the “Sponge City” programme, which in part borrows the experiences of low-impact development from the United States and Canada in recent years. Central government departments, including the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development and the Ministry of Water Resources, have selected 16 cities and districts across the country, including Xiamen, Wuhan and Gui'an New Area in Guizhou province, to be testing grounds for the programme. It will allow at least 60 per cent of rainwater to soak into the ground, rather than being discharged into rivers, according to a guideline released by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development last November. The level of filtration could be further raised in some areas with low levels of precipitation to increase the use of rainwater. The project includes the development of residential communities with storage ponds, filtration pools and wetlands, plus roads and squares built with permeable materials that will allow stormwater to soak into the ground more effectively, according to the guideline. “It would require a major shift in ideas about urban construction. Rainwater should be regarded as a resource, rather than a burden to be dealt with. Concepts of urban construction should shift from the destruction of the ecosystem to its renewal,” Chen Zhenggao, Minister of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, told a work conference in May. Su Yonghong, an official with the administrative committee of Gui'an New Area in Guizhou, one of the 16 testing areas for the project, said it would have greater significance in older urban areas that are prone to flooding. “If the urban run-off cannot be effectively filtered into the ground, the floods that ensue will cause the direct loss of life and property,” he said. Su said he believes low-impact development represents the future of the country's urbanisation drive. “[Dealing with stormwater] is an issue of public security, so it should be a mandatory requirement when new urban areas are being planned and built,” he said. However, he warned that funding such a programme could be a major problem because it would require massive infrastructure investment. According to Chen, the government minister, the programme will require investment of 100 million yuan to 150 million yuan for each square kilometre under development. The high levels of required funding will pose challenges for local authorities, and even though the central government will provide each city with a subsidy of 400 million yuan to develop the Sponge City project, to complete the entire program in the Gui'an New Area would require total investment of 4.6 billion yuan, he said. “We hope the central government can provide more financial support for the programme, and develop criteria to evaluate cities' ability to prevent urban flooding, so that more of them will be motivated to develop programmes such as this,” he said.
