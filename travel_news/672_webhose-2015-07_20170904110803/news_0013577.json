I looked at some of the universities I had researched while applying first time around. Bournemouth was one I had seen beforehand, and games technology was what I really wanted to do, so when it got to Clearing I phoned them up straight away. The day before Results Day, I sat down with my parents and went through all the possible solutions, and so had a plan set out. There was still a panic, but it took a lot of the pressure off; we had pretty much done it all by 9am, because we didn’t have to search for all the numbers. I had two options through Clearing, either Bournemouth or Essex. As I lived closer to Bournemouth, and I’d been there before, I just felt more comfortable going there. They both offered the same sort of course, but I chose Bournemouth because of its location, and because it felt safer. Clearing gave me the opportunity to change to something I really wanted to do – computer science to games technology – and I think I’m better off for it; I’ve enjoyed the course far more than I would have enjoyed computer science. My advice would be to just try and sort out as much as you can beforehand, and in terms of accommodation, don’t be afraid to talk to people. I had to sort that out on the day, because the university ran out really quickly. I found a Facebook page dedicated to finding housemates, I don’t think it was set up by the university but I looked at all the posts, saw all the houses available, and looked for people who were just after one other person. I think I had about 10 houses which I went and looked at, and then I decided. I think Clearing can be hugely beneficial. I know some people really have their mind set on what they want to do, and don’t want to change it; but I feel as if I’ve done a lot better at Bournemouth than I would have done at any other university. Just make sure you're really organised; get numbers, get emails and talk to people. All the tutors and staff have done [Clearing] a million times before, so they’re going to be able to help.\" • Step-by-step guide to A-level Results Day • Step-by-step guide to Clearing • Step-by-step guide to Adjustment • Download the Telegraph's Clearing app for iPhone and Android telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T16:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T12:34:07.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
