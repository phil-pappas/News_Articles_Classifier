Source: NewsComAu Cold snap brings snow across the south-east 1:30 \nThe cold snap hitting Australia's south-east has brought snow and icy conditions large parts of Vic and NSW. Sky News News \nTHE Antarctic Vortex is an interesting and highly complex weather system. \nHeavy snow fell briefly at high elevations on Friday before the really cold air arrived. Then a good dump of snow came and went swiftly last night in the first wave of the system, extending from Victoria to the NSW northern tablelands. \nRight now we’re in a bit of a lull as we wait for predicted heavy snow tonight and into Monday. That’s when the really big totals should paint the landscape white from Victoria to as far north as the Queensland border. \nBut how much snow has fallen so far? Well, Perisher says 25cm has fallen in the past 24 hours, its nearby NSW Thredbo claims 20cm, while Victorian resorts Falls Creek and Hotham are claiming a more modest 13cm. \nMeanwhile towns across NSW and Victoria well below the normal winter snowline have experienced falls of up to 5 centimetres. \nBut if you really want to know the truth about the current snow depth as the Antarctic Vortex rages on, trust only the “beer-o-meter”, and other assorted “o-meters”, which helpful users on leading snow industry website ski.com.au are posting on the forums to show readers the real depth. \nHere’s this morning’s beer-o-meter courtesy of user “Camelot”. The pic is from Hotham resort in Victoria. Mmmm... frozen beer. Source: NewsComAu \nIt looks a lot better than yesterday’s, doesn’t it. You’ve got good taste in beer too, Camelot. Source: NewsComAu \nOK, now here’s the step-o-meter, also courtesy of Camelot. This man uses his time and digital camera to excellent effect. These first snowfalls are a step in the right direction.

Source: NewsComAu \nHere’s the bike-o-meter, courtesy of Cedarwood Apartments, also at the Victorian ski resort of Falls Creek. It appears to be some kind of bottle-o-meter too. Source: NewsComAu \nLastly, let’s not forget the goggle-bottle-o-meter from Perisher, which sounds like something out of Dr Seuss. It comes via ski.com.au forum member “Cuddles”. Well everyone knows bottles go well with glasses.
