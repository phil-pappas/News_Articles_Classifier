Welcoming 28.9 million passengers from January to June 2015, FRA achieved strong 4.1 percent growth compared to the previous year and a new historic half-year passenger record. Furthermore, the average number of passengers per flight rose to 135.4 - an all-time high at FRA. Accumulated maximum takeoff weights (MTOWs) grew by 3.3 percent to 14.4 million metric tons, while aircraft movements remained stable (up 0.2 percent) at 229,582 takeoffs and landings for the same period. FRA's cargo throughput (airfreight and airmail) declined by 1.8 percent to about 1.04 million metric tons. \nIn the reporting month of June 2015 Germany's largest airport served 5.7 million passengers (up 2.8 percent year-on-year) - the busiest June in FRA's history. Cargo (airfreight and airmail) dropped by 2.5 percent to 173,984 metric tons. Accumulated MTOWs rose by 2.4 percent compared with the same month last year to about 2.6 million metric tons. Aircraft movements experienced a moderate increase of 0.8 percent to 42,288 takeoffs and landings at Frankfurt. FRA also registered a new June record for two key indicators: the number of passengers per flight (145.7 passengers) and the MTOW per aircraft movement (124.2 metric tons). Fraport AG's executive board chairman Dr. Stefan Schulte explained: \"These figures prove that aircraft movements have had only an under-proportional impact on Frankfurt's passenger growth - due to larger aircraft being deployed and to higher seat-load factors for flights operating at FRA.\" \nOverall, Fraport AG's international Group airports also reported gains in passenger traffic. The newest member of the Fraport family, Slovenia's Ljubljana Airport (LJU), received 626,525 passengers year-on-year and recorded dynamic growth of 9.7 percent in the first half. In June 2015, LJU welcomed 149,541 passengers, a jump of 17 percent year-on-year. In South America, Peru's Lima Airport (LIM) also saw traffic advance by 8.7 percent to 8 million passengers in the first six months of 2015 and by 8.4 percent to1.3 million passengers in June 2015. Combined, the Twinstar airports of Varna (VAR) and Burgas (BOJ) on the Bulgarian Black Sea coast experienced a 12.8 percent slide in the first half to 948,519 passengers and a 16.4 percent decline in June 2015 to 632,172 passengers. On the Turkish Riviera, Antalya Airport (AYT) also saw traffic fall by 4.2 percent in the first six months of the year to 10.5 million passengers and also by 6.9 percent in June 2015 to 3.6 million passengers. From January to June 2015, Russia's St. Petersburg Airport (LED) had a similar decline of 4.3 percent to 6.1 million passengers. LED's traffic dropped by 8.3 percent in June 2015 to about 1.5 million passengers. Fraport's minority-owned airport in Hanover (HAJ), northern Germany, showed rising passenger figures, with about 2.5 million in the first half (up 5.3 percent) and 537,323 in June 2015 (up 8 percent). Xi'an Airport (XIY) in central China greeted 15.7 million passengers in the first half of 2015, representing a 15.3 percent surge in traffic. In the reporting month, XIY had about 2.7 million passengers, up 11.3 percent year-on-year. \nPrint-quality photos of Fraport AG and Frankfurt Airport are available for free downloading via the photo library located in our Press Center on the Fraport Web site.

In 2014, the Fraport Group generated sales of EUR 2.4 billion and profit of about EUR 252 million. Last year more than 108.5 million passengers used airports around the world in which Fraport has more than a 50 percent stake. \nAt its Frankfurt Airport (FRA) home base, Fraport welcomed about 60 million passengers and handled some 2.2 million metric tons of cargo (airfreight and airmail) in 2014. For the current summer timetable, FRA is served by 104 passenger airlines flying to some 297 destinations in 104 countries worldwide. More than half of FRA's destinations are intercontinental (beyond Europe) - underscoring Frankfurt's role as a leading hub in the global air transportation system. In Europe, Frankfurt Airport ranks first in terms of cargo tonnage and is the third-busiest for passenger traffic. With about 55 percent of all passengers using Frankfurt as a connecting hub, FRA also has the highest transfer rate among the major European hubs. Frankfurt Airport City has become Germany's largest job complex at a single location, employing more than 80,000 people at some 500 companies and organizations on site. Major new real estate developments - such as The Squaire, the Gateway Gardens business park, and the MÃ¶nchhof Logistics Park - are creating an exciting new dimension and range of services at the evolving Frankfurt Airport City of the 21st century. \nAlmost half of Germany's population lives within a 200-kilometer radius of the FRA intermodal travel hub - the largest airport catchment area in Europe. FRA Airport City also serves as a magnet for other companies located throughout the economically vital Frankfurt/Rhine-Main-Neckar region. Thanks to synergies associated with the region's dynamic industries, networked expertise, and outstanding intermodal transportation infrastructure, FRA's world route network enables Hesse's and Germany's export-oriented businesses to flourish in global growth markets. \nFrankfurt Airport meets the increasing needs of the export-oriented economies of the State of Hesse as well as Germany as a whole, for optimal connections to growth markets around the globe. Likewise, FRA is a strategic gateway for companies wanting to access the huge European marketplace. Thus, Frankfurt Airport - which is strategically located in the heart of Europe - is one of the most important hubs in the global logistics chain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T09:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T18:01:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
