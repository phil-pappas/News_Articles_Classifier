Customers wait to use a cash machine in Greece. \nThe travel association has issued a new statement, containing advice for holidaymakers. \nAlthough it says there are no limits on foreigners withdrawing money from cash machines it adds “there are mixed reports on availability of cash from ATMs.” \nAbta also reminded consumers to take out travel insurance “as soon as they book their holiday.” \n“We do not anticipate that there will be any need for tour operators to rebook their customers to a different destination,” the statement said. \n“At present we have no indication that holidaymakers will be disrupted however, as with all destination matters, we will continue to monitor the situation and work with our Members on any developments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T17:18:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
