A joint venture among White Lodging Services Corporation, the Harry Whittington family and REI Real Estate Services, LLC., the 19-story hotel, which draws design inspiration from the local music scene, is Westin’s second Austin property, and one of five new openings in North America this year. \nThe Westin Austin Downtown used HKS Architects, Inc. and was designed by Simeone Deary. Upon entering the lobby, guests are transported to a modern-day oasis where they are met with a 12-foot-tall custom-made art piece comprised of charred wood blocks that come together to form the body of a guitar. Incorporating natural design elements, the lobby ceiling and vertical garden mimic the cutouts of a Dobro guitar, while the ballroom floors allude to prints often found on guitar straps. In keeping with the Austin music theme, the hotel will regularly host local musicians in the lounge area. “We wanted to pay homage to all Austin has to offer, and, of course, music is a huge part of that,” said Kristofer Carlson, General Manager of The Westin Austin Downtown. “Most of the inspiration comes from vintage guitars, so you’ll see many parts of the hotel subtly reflect various guitar components. That, combined with Westin’s signature amenities, will offer Austinites and visitors alike a relaxing-yet-energized stay.” The new Westin offers one of the city’s most spectacular rooftops with uninterrupted 180-degree views of the city. A relaxing getaway for guests amidst the energy of Austin, the rooftop is home to Azul – the city’s tallest hotel rooftop pool and bar, which features cabanas and a fire pit, as well as the 24-hour Westin WORKOUT® Fitness Studio. The hotel offers its signature Gear Lending program, providing New Balance® shoes and athletic wear for guests who like to pack light. The local Run Concierge is also available to provide guided group runs of Austin’s most well-known sites or recommend routes for guests who would like to explore the city solo. “Filled with so much vigor and energy, it was only natural that our second hotel in Austin be in the heart of downtown,” said Bob Jacobs, Vice President, Brand Management, Westin Hotels & Resorts and Sheraton Hotels & Resorts. “The Westin Austin Downtown aims to provide guests and locals alike with an escape from the hustle and bustle, while still embracing the city’s culture.” Up the guitar-string staircase, The Westin Austin Downtown is home to 366 contemporary guest rooms and suites, each featuring a signature Westin Heavenly Bed® to ensure a great night’s sleep, the soothing Heavenly Shower/Bath®, high-speed Internet, plush robes and a 100 percent smoke-free environment. The hotel also features the city’s newest restaurant, Stella San Jac, an Austin-American restaurant serving eclectic Southern cuisine. Guests have access to 24-hour in-room dining from the hotel’s full-service kitchen, and for extra nourishment, The Westin Austin Downtown offers fresh juices and smoothies, SuperFoodsRx choices for adults and The Westin Eat Well Menu for Kids. The hotel features more than 13,500 square feet of state-of-the-art meeting and banquet space, inclusive of 16 individual meeting rooms, each named after a famous Austin musician or venue, including Joplin, Benson, Paramount, Continental and Moody. “The new Westin Austin Downtown has already enabled us to make advances in both the size and quality of groups that we are now able to attract with the additional inventory,” said Bob Lander, president and CEO of the Austin Convention & Visitors Bureau (CVB). Starwood Preferred Guest® members checking into The Westin Austin Downtown between July 16 and Sept. 12 will receive 1,000 bonus Starpoints.
