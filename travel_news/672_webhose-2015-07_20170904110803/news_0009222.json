Several things happened that I found completely unacceptable.”\nOne of those “things” was when Ramsay rocked up to MPW’s wedding in 2000 with a camera crew in tow, without asking for permission.\n“That is disgusting behaviour, isn’t it?” said MPW.\n“Is that the correct way to treat a so-called friend? I don’t think so.”\nMarco Pierre White with assistant chef Gordon Ramsay at Harveys restaurant in 1989.

And I just thought: I’m not happy.\n“I thought that by winning three stars I would be happy, I thought I’d be accepted. But I was almost in a worse position. Because when you’re a one-star chef, your mentors don’t feel threatened by you; even when you’re a two-star chef they don’t, because they’re still top of their tree and they think ‘my boy Marco’ — because remember, I was totally homegrown, I never went to France.\n“And then when I won three stars, they’d all started to crumble, or got bored with the stove, and what they couldn’t cope with was that Marco was now the boss in their world. And then I saw the knives come in behind me and I started getting disillusioned with my whole world.”\nMPW designed the menu for some P & O cruise ships, such as the Britannia, which the Queen toured recently.

Instead, he has his own driver.\nFor more than 15 years, his personal assistant and chauffeur was an impeccably dressed Japanese man called Mr Ishii, who recently retired.\n“I don’t think I’ve ever met a finer man than Mr. Ishii,” said MPW to RTÉ in 2011.\n“He has such integrity and such a beautiful philosophy on life.”\nMovie: MPW’s life could soon be the subject of a Hollywood film. Ridley Scott bought the rights to the chef’s autobiography, The Devil In The Kitchen , and Michael Fassbender has reportedly been offered the starring role.\n“He’s a wonderful actor and quite extraordinary,” said MPW to the Daily Mail last year.\n“We had dinner and he was incredibly cool. He just oozed charisma. He has a magnetic energy and I would love him to play me. He has that fire inside his belly that I understand.\n“It’s a great privilege to have met him and to be working with Ridley. I’m just a cook, a Yorkshire boy from humble beginnings, so to have a movie made about my life is pretty incredible.”\nMichael Fassbender could play MPW in a film about the chef’s life.

I said to the maitre d’, ‘Not a problem, we’ll charge him accordingly,’” said MPW to The Australian .\nFamily man: MPW has four kids from his three failed marriages, and considers his offspring to be his greatest achievement.\n“I’ve learned more about myself through my children than any other experiences,” he said to The Guardian earlier this year.\n“By looking at them and watching them grow, you start to understand yourself.”\nHis 20-year-old son, Marco Pierre White Jr, is a professional model who is starting to make a name for himself in the fashion world.\nFather and son.
