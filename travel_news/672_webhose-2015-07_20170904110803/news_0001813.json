Twelve were to come from China, each staying for two months at a time. The rest were to be made up of Italians, mostly students of Chinese or people with a great interest in Chinese culture, who were to work for three months. The team worked six days a week, either from 10.30am to 3.30pm or from 3.30pm until 9pm. “I had some expectations before I came to the expo, but being here has really surprised me. Everything at China Pavilion has greatly impressed me,” said volunteer Valentina Antonaci, 25. “If you go around the expo, you can see the China Pavilion is the biggest of them all. With the garden and flowers, it’s absolutely amazing.” The master’s degree student, who majored in cultural studies and economics at Milan University, comes from about 16 miles northeast in Masate. She said becoming a volunteer was like a dream come true. It had helped her to vastly improve her spoken Mandarin, as well as to make many friends and deepen her understanding of China. “Five years ago, when I heard the expo would happen, I started studying Chinese. Over time my language got better, and here I am as a volunteer,” she said, adding that she one day hopes to be a teacher at a Confucius Institute in Italy. The Chinese volunteers said they had been impressed by their Italian colleagues’ passion and hard-working attitude. Miss Yu said the close interaction had changed her perception of Italian people. I’d been taking the Chinese language, food and culture for granted, but as I’ve been asked questions by visitors I’ve really had to think about these crucial elements of our culture “I realised they take great responsibility for the tasks assigned to them,” she said. “On the first day, for example, we were very busy and the weather was very cold, but the Italians worked so hard and never complained.” She said her Italian colleagues had also made her feel at home, especially when she fell ill. She recalled: “I went back to our accommodation one day to rest, and they contacted me to ask if I was OK. When they saw me the next day, they wanted to make sure I was feeling better and told me I could rest more if I still didn’t feel well. I was touched.” Ruan Weisha, a fourth-year Italian major at Beijing’s Communication University of China, had previously spent a year on a exchange programme in Perugia, so was already familiar with the country’s culture before signing up as a volunteer. Yet she said the expo experience has broadened her understanding of Italy. “When I studied in Perugia, many of my classmates were international students, so I felt the exposure to Italian culture was limited. At the expo I need to help Italian visitors every day, so I can practise my language and learn more about their ways of thinking,” she said. “I love the language, it’s so musical, and I love Italian food. The culture is diverse, and I’m discovering so much about culture in different parts of the country.” The expo had also showed her how international the world today is, she added. “Here we have visitors from all over the globe. I can see Muslim women in hijabs and other women in miniskirts. It’s really a melting pot of culture, and I feel happy our world is such an inclusive place.” Introducing Chinese culture and history to expo visitors had also helped Ms Ruan to better appreciate and understand her own culture. “I’d been taking the Chinese language, food and culture for granted, but as I’ve been asked questions by visitors I’ve really had to think about these crucial elements of our culture,” she said, citing the common fascination with dishes such as Beijing duck and tofu. “Chinese culture is still unknown to many people in the world, but they are very curious to learn, and I’m very glad that I can be a part of this process to make it more accessible and less mysterious.” As well as learning Chinese culture, volunteers at the China Pavilion have also learnt valuable life skills, such as how to control crowds of people as well as responding to a medical emergency. “We have learnt to calmly find solutions and at the same time to take the initiative to think about how to better do things,” Miss Yu said. “On many occasions our suggestions have been accepted by our supervisors,” such as re-orientating the registration table to allow more space for visitors to queue at the entrance. “I feel my tasks, however small, contribute toward a bigger cause, and it’s very fulfilling,” she added. Volunteers from all over the world have been living together in the expo village in Milan, and Miss Yu said she had made friends with people from other nations, especially from Kazakhstan, as their rooms were so close. “We play table tennis a lot. I’m surprised by how good they are,” she said. “They are such friendly people. We’ve enjoyed our time together.” This article was originally produced and published by China Daily.
