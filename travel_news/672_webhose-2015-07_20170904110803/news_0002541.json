It’s experiential food.” Four-day trips start at $3,495 per person, and the company expects to add 10 new itineraries in 2016. SANTA BARBARA BEACH REOPENS The Refugio State Beach , one of two major beaches closed near Santa Barbara since a May 19 oil spill , will reopen today. Over 100,000 gallons of crude oil leaked from a ruptured pipeline attached to an offshore drilling platform, coating the coast with oil around Gaviota, 20 miles west of Santa Barbara. After shore and sea cleanup operations, the other park, El Capitan State Beach, reopened June 26 and both state parks have been cleared for swimming, fishing and camping. However, pocket beaches between Refugio and El Capitan, Las Flores and Venedito, accessible only at low tide, will remain closed for cleanup with no estimated reopening date, according to Eric Hjelstrom, California State Park superintendent. GREYHOUND GOES SOUTH OF THE BORDER For the first time ever, the intercity bus operator Greyhound has started service to Mexico. The new bus routes, which began operating Wednesday, will include more than 23 weekly departures, and will link terminals in Nuevo Laredo on the border and Monterrey farther south to several cities in Texas, including Laredo, San Antonio, Austin and Dallas. Greyhound said it is the first United States company to be granted authority to operate domestic service in Mexico. It will build new Mexican terminals to support the service. New buses deployed on the routes feature free Wi-Fi, leather seats, power outlets, footrests and onboard restrooms. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T12:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T13:18:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
