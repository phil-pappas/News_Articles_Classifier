The development shall also be set in relation to last year’s strong traffic growth, high passenger load factor and weak yield. During June 44 seasonal routes were opened as part of the network adjustment for the summer months as a response to increasing demand on leisure routes, particularly to southern Europe. Traffic responded above all well to/from Sweden where it grew by approximately 6%.\nScheduled capacity was decreased 0.2% while traffic during June decreased 3.8%, which resulted in a decline in the load factor of 3 p.u. to 80%. SAS intercontinental capacity was decreased by 3.7% and the traffic was down 5.6%. During June, the fourth upgraded long haul aircraft was phased into traffic. SAS traffic on European/ Intrascandinavian routes decreased 3.1% from high levels last year.
