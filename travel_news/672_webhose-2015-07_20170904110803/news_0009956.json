Tony Soorangura, associate managing director of NS Travel & Tours, said his business has known about the policy since late last year, while authorities have not yet contacted Khiri Travel Group. \n\nTony said: “It adds cost and wastes time with no obvious benefit...We are facing an economic downturn and there is only one machine left to drive income — tourism. As such we are in need of support and encouragement, not another layer of non-practical policy.” \n\nWillem Niemeijer, CEO of Khiri Travel Group, nevertheless agreed the policy would increase costs without delivering any benefits. \n\n“Laos has a similar approach (to the regulation), without an online site. It does not work there and serves no purpose,” he remarked. \n\nThe Bureau of Tourism Business and Guide Registration, which is responsible for administering the regulation, could not be reached for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T17:37:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
