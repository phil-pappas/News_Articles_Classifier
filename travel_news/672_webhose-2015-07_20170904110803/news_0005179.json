The Atlanta-based airline reported second-quarter revenue was up 1 percent to $10.7 billion, while profit soared 85 percent to $1.5 billion, or $1.83 a share. Delta (NYSE: DAL) noted Branded Fares boosted passenger revenue by $56 million and its enhanced agreement with American Express garnered $60 million in revenue. Adjusted fuel expense declined over $463 million compared to the same period in 2014, as 39 percent lower market fuel prices and a $77 million increase in profit at Delta’s refinery in Trainer, Pa., offset nearly $600 million in settled hedge losses. “Our commercial initiatives continue to gain traction in the marketplace and we will produce summer margins in excess of any achieved in our history,” Delta President Ed Bastian said, in a statement. “However, unit revenue growth is an important component of our long-term plan to expand margins.
