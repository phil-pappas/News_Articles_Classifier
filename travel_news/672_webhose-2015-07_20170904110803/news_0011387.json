Here’s how to avoid the problems and pitfalls that could affect your annual vacation. \nUnfortunately, as much as we don’t like to admit it, we save up for what-seems-like-forever to go on a family holiday and sometimes return home stressed and disappointed. A lot of that has to do with the destination and the kinds of activities we include, but also, spending an intense amount of time together also brings its own challenges! \nBut with the incredible and exciting range of family activity holidays available, it's possible to create lifetime memories, for all the right reasons! Whether you choose ski touring in France or dude ranching in the USA, these top tips will help you keep things on an even keel for the duration of your break – and beyond. \nAvoid the Problems and Pitfalls \nIf at all possible, it's a great idea to book several shorter family activity holidays, so the build up isn't as long and the pre-trip stress is minimised. That said, it is also important not to make your holiday too short, as jam-packing in activities to keep the children entertained can prove exhausting for everyone. Allow a little time on the itinerary to chill out completely and let the children do the same - under your watchful eye, of course. \nMake sure you've taken care of all the little details of the trip – including travel insurance, all accommodation and flight arrangements and any vaccinations you may require. Take care not to over plan though - a strict schedule will simply remind the children of school. If you book with a good operator, they'll take care of all the details for you, while you sit back, relax and get set to have fun! \nAlthough family activity holidays involve adventurous pursuits, take care not to take any unnecessary risks. If you are participating in adventure sports, use the correct equipment and only go with a trained professional. You will also need to make sure you are all insured for the proposed activity. \nIf your family are prone to a bit of bickering (like most!), you should carefully consider the accommodation set-up. It may be beneficial to forget the hotel room and rent an apartment so everyone can have time to themselves when they want it. In addition, if some family members have different interests you can separate so everyone can pursue their own activities. Family activity holidays often involve different family members doing different things, for example, mum and daughter go kayaking while dad and son go fishing. \nFinally, don’t feel guilty when you’re not all getting on - normal life doesn’t stop just because you’re away from home. In fact, the more time you spend together, the more testing times you may have; but, conversely, the more time you spend together, the more fun, bonding experiences you can enjoy as well.   \nRichard Edwards is the Managing Director of Summit & Blue, an adventure holiday company offering independently crafted family activity holidays to exciting destinations around the world, including France, Italy, Portugal, the USA and Canada.
