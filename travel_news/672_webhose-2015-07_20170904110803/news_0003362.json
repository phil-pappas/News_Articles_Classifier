And of course some of the best food and drink in the skies.\nLead-in economy return fares to Delhi start from £632.\nNext up for the longer 787 is Abu Dhabi and Muscat - a combined flight - and Kuala Lumpur . BA will eventually have 42 Dreamliners.\nThe revolutionary 787s are made largely from composite material and passengers enjoy a more spacious, airy plane with wider aisles and higher ceilings plus mood lighting and larger windows offering views of the horizon from every seat.\nChanges they feel rather than see include moister, cleaner air at a lower cabin pressure - 5-6,000ft rather than the typical 8,000ft - which allows more oxygen to be absorbed into the blood to reduce the chance of dehydration and headaches.\nThe physical flight is better, too, as 787s offer a smoother, quieter journey thanks to noise-reducing engines and wings that counter turbulence. All those factors combine to help reduce the effects of jetlag.\nNick Morrish/BA Upgrade: British Airways is giving 18 of its Boeing 747 jumbo jets a facelift from September\nThere's good news for BA passengers on its Boeing 747s too.
