The return journey will depart Manila at 23:59pm, arriving into Doha at 05:05am the following day. \n“The increase in flight frequencies on the Doha–Manila route serves to further strengthen commercial and trade links between our two countries and we are delighted to be able to provide our Philippines-based passengers with greater connectivity options when they choose to fly with Qatar Airways,” said Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, Mr Akbar Al Baker. \nQatar Airways, which was recently crowned Airline of the Year at the 2015 annual Skytrax World Airline Awards currently flies a modern fleet of 162 aircraft to 148 business and leisure destinations across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific, North America and South America. \nRoutes Asia 2016 will take place in Manila, hosted by the Philippine Department of Tourism, from 6 – 8 March 2016. \nRoutes Asia forms the essential event for all aviation based companies who wish to conduct business to, from and within the region. The event brings together a range of airlines, airports and tourism authorities, including some of the largest carriers from the whole Asian region. \nManila’s Ninoy Aquino International Airport has recently received an upgrade to its Terminal 1 and the construction of an elevated highway linking the Terminal 1, 2, and 3 to the Skyway and Manila Bay is also on-going and is expected to be completed by 2016.
