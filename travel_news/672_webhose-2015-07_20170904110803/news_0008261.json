DreamPictures / Getty Images \nCanadians have a reputation as approachable and friendly, however their amiable disposition does not necessarily translate to providing exceptional customer service , especially when compared to the kind of help you get in U.S. stores. \nFor example, I strolled into a clothing store the other day on Locke Street in Hamilton, Ontario . I was in a mood to buy something: \"Fill the void,\" as my husband calls it. \nThe store is small with a manageable number of clothes to peruse, but I am not good at picking out stuff to try on, so I browse aimlessly. Eventually, I imagine, the store clerk, who is busying herself with hangers and hasn't spoken to me, will rescue me with expert advice and I will leave happy - void filled. \nWell, \"eventually\" never arrives and I finally break the awkward silence (I mean, how long can two people occupy the same space without acknowledging the other? ) by commenting on how much I like her pants. \"Thanks,\" she says, like she just noticed my presence in her store, \" Second Yoga Jeans .\" \n\"Second Yoga Jeans?\" I respond far too enthusiastically, relieved to be engaged in conversation, \"I love my pair \" \nThere, I've given her the opportunity to sell me my next pair. The purple ones are nice. I'd buy those. Wait for it nothing. The store owner in the comfortable yet stylish slacks smiles wanly and returns to pulling things out of boxes. She doesn't tell me about this season's latest colours or trends; she doesn't ask me if I am looking for anything in particular; she doesn't even make banal comments about the weather. \nThis kind of dismal retail experience is polar opposite to most interactions I've had with salespeople in the U.S. Retailers and hospitality staff there show keen interest in their customers. After all, it's the land of the Wal-Mart greeter, someone hired specifically to say hello to people walking into the store. The U.S. retail industry is steeped in the culture of delivering outstanding customer service; it's one of the things they do best. Is it phoney? Maybe. But good customer service costs less than bad customer service. \nThe picture I paint of customer service in Canada is with broad strokes and oodles of exceptions exist. In tourist-targeted places, like Niagara Falls or the Eaton Center , the level of service is noticeably better and visitors to Canada are bound to experience some upstanding examples of friendly, helpful service. \nWhy is customer service lacklustre in Canada? Maybe we're too laid back to care or to fabricate enthusiasm. Perhaps we don't buy into capitalism as wholeheartedly as our neighbours to the south. We don't get trained properly for sure. But whatever it is, when you rub shoulders with a store clerk in Canada and she doesn't even say \"Hello,\" don't take it personally.
