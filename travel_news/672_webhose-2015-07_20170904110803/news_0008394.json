The 27-year-old now ranks second in the NWSL in goals this season with eight, just one shy of Washington’s Crystal Dunn. \nYanez is the third Reign player to be so honored so far this year, with teammates Megan Rapinoe and Jess Fishlock earning Player of the Week nods for weeks one and nine, respectively. \nFirst-place Seattle returns to action on Saturday in Boston against the Breakers.
