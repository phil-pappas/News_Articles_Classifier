I looked at it and saw it was (nearly) flying over the UK, Iceland, and Greenland, countries that have been at the top of my travel list for a long time. I immediately thought of doing the same trip over land, going from country to country — walking this route had, at that moment, not crossed my mind but quite soon I combined the urge of doing a long distance walk with going to New York over land,\" he explains. Ulrich gave notice at his job in February, and set off only weeks later. He has documented his travels on his website, walk2nyc.com , and his Instagram, @arjenulrich . \n\"The first week of walking was terrible. I had never walked more than 10km before I made the decision of doing this trip. I did four rather easy walks of 34kmin the last three months before I left but walking day in day out with a 15kg backpack wasn't easy at all.\" A photo posted by arjenulrich (@arjenulrich) on Mar 1, 2015 at 12:12pm PST \n\"I try to keep walking to a maximum of eight hours, which equals 40km. However, when I see I have to do more than that (up to 50km I will just wake up early and make sure I have enough energy to make it.\" A photo posted by arjenulrich (@arjenulrich) on Mar 20, 2015 at 1:38pm PDT \n\"Looking at the flight path of the plane flying from New York to Amsterdam I figured it would be best to at least cover the UK, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland, Canada and the US. I've added Belgium and France so that I could walk almost entirely to England, taking only the ferry from Calais to Dover. This first part also allowed me to get used to walking while still talking Dutch in an area that is familiar to me. In case something would terribly go wrong, I could easily take a train home.\" A photo posted by arjenulrich (@arjenulrich) on Feb 28, 2015 at 11:53pm PST \n\"The total route I planned covered 3200km, calculating only the parts from Alkmaar, The Netherlands, to Thurso, Scotland, and from Quebec City, Canada, to New York City.\" A photo posted by arjenulrich (@arjenulrich) on Mar 16, 2015 at 4:26pm PDT \n\"When I left on the first of March I had already arranged places to sleep for the first two weeks, as well as hosts in several cities in England. They were mostly friends, family or friends of friends. I also started using Couchsurfing.com, which turned out to be very successful.\" A photo posted by arjenulrich (@arjenulrich) on Mar 24, 2015 at 3:17pm PDT \n\"While enjoying the natural spa in Bath, England, looking over the city from the rooftop pool, I thought: 'I walked all the way here already!' That was seriously one of the best thoughts I had in a long time. Thinking about that moment still makes me happy.\" A photo posted by arjenulrich (@arjenulrich) on Apr 9, 2015 at 1:27am PDT \n\"Since I decided to do this walk on such short notice, there wasn't too much time to save up a lot of money. I have some savings though, but I need most of it for when I get back, since I bought a house a few years ago and quit my job to do this trip. Right after planning the route I created a spreadsheet that would give a clear overview on income and expenses for the last three months, and included the goal of spending not more than €10 (NZ$16.8) a day, resulting in €1800 for the total of six months.\" A photo posted by arjenulrich (@arjenulrich) on Apr 10, 2015 at 5:12am PDT \n\"It has been difficult to stick to €10 and on average I'm closer to €20 a day. I found that it's mostly the social connection you don't want to miss out on that costs money. When a host invites you for a drink with friends in the pub, then the social aspect to me is more important than sticking to your wish to live as cheap as possible.\" A photo posted by arjenulrich (@arjenulrich) on May 17, 2015 at 8:46am PDT \n\"I remember discussing the plan with a colleague over lunch. He said: 'If you're doing this for €10 a day, then I would want to sponsor you for a day.' At first I didn't want any sponsors. It would put pressure on what I'm doing as opposed to freedom, and, knowing that I never walked that much before, the trip may have ended quite soon after starting, presenting a failure to the sponsors. However, the idea of having individual people supporting me on specific date sounded very interesting ... All together I have received funds for at least a hundred days.\" A photo posted by arjenulrich (@arjenulrich) on Apr 30, 2015 at 8:03am PDT \n\"Very often I get asked about the most beautiful place I visited during my walk and although both the nature and urban areas have been very inspiring in all the countries I've seen so far, the people I meet interest me the most.\" A photo posted by arjenulrich (@arjenulrich) on May 4, 2015 at 5:12am PDT \n\"I like to see where they live and how they live, what decisions they have made in life and what they have planned for the future. I enjoy living someone else's life for a day or even a moment. I want to get inspired by them and, by that, make decisions -- or at least think -- about my own life. How do I want to live my life and what does my future look like?\" A photo posted by arjenulrich (@arjenulrich) on Jun 18, 2015 at 1:28pm PDT \n\"During my travels I've enjoyed the company of a new friend while walking from London to Hillington; my Couchsurfing host from Bath joined me to Bristol and another host met me halfway from Swindon to Devices with a packed lunch (his wife took my heavy backpack home by car). I have met a few people along the way, mostly other walkers or people enjoying their hometown surroundings.\" A photo posted by arjenulrich (@arjenulrich) on Jun 22, 2015 at 10:11am PDT \n\"Hitchhiking through the north of Iceland from Seyðisfjörður (east) to Reykjavik (west) resulted in one of the best experiences on this trip so far. With still more than 350km to go I got a ride from a Canadian guy who was spending his three short days in Iceland by driving around the whole country, only to stop to take pictures or for a short nap in the car. I joined him through the night, saw the sunset and sunrise at 2:30am and slept outside on a piece of grass, finding the sun high up in the sky warming up my face as I woke up at 9am. That was freedom in near-perfect form!\" A photo posted by arjenulrich (@arjenulrich) on Jun 27, 2015 at 9:28am PDT \n\"I have been thinking about the last day of walking. I hope that getting to New York feels as good as I think it's going to be, walking over one of the bridges into Manhattan, with the sun in my face, knowing that it's only one more hour to the finish line.\" A photo posted by arjenulrich (@arjenulrich) on Jun 10, 2015 at 4:20am PDT \n\"I met a lot of people who said that they wouldn't be able to walk such a long distance. Well, I never walked long distances before but I believed that I could do it and I needed to try it to know for sure. Only by doing do we learn about our own limits. Not giving it a try because people tell you it's impossible doesn't give you anything.\" A photo posted by arjenulrich (@arjenulrich) on Jul 20, 2015 at 11:21am PDT \n\"I like the thought of freedom and being able of doing what you want to do. Take action and make positive life changes in whatever situation you are. With that I hope to inspire people a bit into doing what they have always wanted to do. It is possible but it takes courage.\" A photo posted by arjenulrich (@arjenulrich) on Jul 21, 2015 at 5:22am PDT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T05:31:40.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
