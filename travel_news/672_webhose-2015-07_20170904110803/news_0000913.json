In 1999, artist Stuart Semple built up a loyal following of fans by selling his work at the same time every day on eBay. Lately, he’s been auctioning off artist-made websites and artworks via iTunes. These days his paintings sell for serious money. Artists aren’t the only ones. A new generation of art collectors use Facebook and Instagram to promote their favourite artists. Museums, too, have got in on the act. Their websites are no longer simply a marketing tool – the Walker in Minneapolis runs theirs like a magazine. So does The Royal Academy of Arts in London. The Gemüldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden has entirely reproduced itself in Second Life – so you can now explore its amazing collections of Titians and Tintorettos from your mobile. You can build amazing online networks with artists, press, collectors, and curators These days, iPads are increasingly found inside exhibitions, too. Staff have had to adapt fast. As Minnie Scott, Curator for Interpretation at Tate, says: “The line between digital and non-digital resources in museums is blurring and the distinction is becoming irrelevant. What this means for people working in museum interpretation is that digital production ability will move from a ‘desirable’ to an ‘essential’ skill.” This goes for galleries as well. The internet has already revolutionised the way we communicate, but the full effects have yet to be felt. Every week seems to see the launch of a new art sales website, but few have been successful. Collectors have been loath to part with money without seeing a work in the flesh. But this is finally changing. Artspace.com and Gagosian.com have led the way, and online sales now account for some 6 per cent of the market – mostly at the lower end (which still means up to about £30,000). For artists, art schools are still the established career path, and some of the best in the world are right here in the UK. Unfortunately, these schools have generally been poor at preparing artists for the big wide world. Young artists should be aware that Facebook, Twitter, and a nice website are becoming increasingly important. “You can build amazing online networks with artists, press, collectors, and curators,” says artist and curator Rosalind Davis, who also runs courses about social media. “As an artist, you have to be inventive.” Thankfully, colleges are beginning to change, and tuition fees will accentuate their focus on careers. At the same time, such institutions may no longer be able to offer the traditional safety net. Phyllida Barlow, for example, was a highly respected tutor at Chelsea College of Art for more than forty years, but it is only since 2010 that she has risen to prominence as an artist in her own right. Barlow’s large-scale installations, as seen at Tate Britain in 2014, require the work of a number of assistants. The first job for many young artists may well be assisting those higher up the ladder. The first job for many young artists may well be assisting those higher up the ladder Public funding cuts will continue and while artists respond in a myriad of different ways, museums, too, will have to innovate. The contemporary museum already has diverse revenue streams, but pressure will mount on blockbuster exhibitions to secure high ticket sales and appeal to sponsors and advertisers. Some institutions are already looking abroad: the British Museum is helping to launch the Zayed National Museum in Abu Dhabi. Such partnerships look set to multiply. Amid so much rapid change, it’s perhaps reassuring that expertise remains highly valued. For many roles in major museums, auction houses or commercial galleries, a master’s degree in art history is still a prerequisite. In the art world, knowledge and experience still matter – and that won’t be changing anytime soon. • Find more tips for studying, working and gap years on The Axis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T19:58:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
