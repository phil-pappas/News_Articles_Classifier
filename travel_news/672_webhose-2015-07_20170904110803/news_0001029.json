We are also trying to make sure that tourists are not affected in any way,\" he said.\n\"We really believe and plan ahead that as of next week we will be getting into a phase that will be better than the phase we've had before.\"\nRead More Greek bailout: What happens now?\nâ€”Reuters contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T22:47:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
