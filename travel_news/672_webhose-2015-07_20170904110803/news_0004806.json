Regardless of the supreme crisis in which the country is involved, utterly deaf to all the dictates of patriotism in a great emergency, cynically ignoring the fact known to all the world that the steady pursuit of their calling furnishes the life-blood of the Navy and of the many industries on which the arming and equipment of his Majesty’s forces depend,” yet alone the fact the Government had made it illegal, the South Wales Miners decided upon their course of strike action by a majority of nearly 2 to 1 – pages 9 and 10 . Some caught up in the action admitted the difficulties of their position; as a Pontypridd miners’ agent put it “we have to fight against the law and against the definite resolutions of our own executive … we have all the world against us, except Germany, Austria and Turkey. We are in a tangle. We are like flies in amber, wondering how we got there.” A leader on page 8 had its suspicions as to who to blame, pointing the finger at the pro-German attitudes of members of the Labour Party and the spread of Syndicalist views, but trusting that in the end the miners “who are by no means unintelligent” will conclude they have nothing to gain and end this action. Also in today’s paper - Juxtaposed on page 7 we have an upcoming demonstration by women demanding to be allowed to serve the state by working, an article looking at how they can be usefully employed on the land, and a letter from “A Prisoner of War Returned” telling how German women make munitions - The Germans start making a move towards Warsaw – page 9 - Austria-Hungary sends a note asking for strict impartiality by America claiming its trading is favouring the Allies – page 9 . The Telegraph is not impressed – “Insolent” and “Impudent” are adjectives it gives to this - Another “Brilliant capture of Turkish positions” is reported in the Dardanelles – page 9 . Over on page 10 returning injured sailors speak of the “overwhelming superiority in numbers” for the Turks and the difficulties of the terrain, which give about the best hints so far as to why the campaign hasn’t been the resounding success it was expected to be - Germany announces it will confiscate the Belgian harvest for the year, but claims it is so that “all the products may be reserved for the use of the civilian population of Belgium” – page 9 - An article on page 11 about supplying the army talks of “Mountains of tea” and “Cigarettes in millions” Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T02:54:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
