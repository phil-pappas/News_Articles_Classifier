The night included highlights of the association’s last 12 months and detailed goals and plans for the coming year. \nTaking place at the unique South African Shaka Zulu, Kelly Baker reflected on memorable moments of her ISES presidency, in particular thanking her sponsors and supportive board members. Kevin introduced the new board members and stated his objectives for his presidency which include a 100% increase in membership, more value for members and an increase in the society’s profile. With the support of Jacqui Partridge from Partridge Events, Shaka Zulu handled the night’s catering, drinks and the South African entertainment with performers dressed as safari animals breakdancing and swinging from the bars. Kevin Jackson commented: “We have big plans for ISES and last night certainly kick-started the year. The strength of the carefully selected new board will help us deliver the goals I’ve set out - I’m very excited to take ISES forward and carry on Kelly’s good work.” Kelly Baker added: “Last night was an opportunity to thank the board members, sponsors and members who have supported myself and ISES throughout the last year. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed the presidency and look forward to staying involved as immediate past president.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T22:21:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
