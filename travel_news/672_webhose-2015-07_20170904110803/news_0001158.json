Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Jul 12, 2015 Adv: \nFive of Uganda’s most popular national parks have this year received TripAdvisor’s Certificate of Excellence 2015, some of them in fact for successive years. \nBwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park, the country’s primary habitat for the prized mountain gorillas, has once again captured this honour. Lake Mburo National Park also was named for the second year running after being recently in the news, when 15 Rothschild giraffes were relocated to Lake Mburo, no doubt greatly enhancing the wildlife viewing experience for visitors. Other parks named were Queen Elizabeth National Park, Murchison Falls National Park, Kibale Forest National Park and Uganda’s main alpine national park, Rwenzori Mountains, aka Mountains of the Moon. \nMuch of Uganda’s tourism sector relies on the country’s wildlife and adventure experiences, and promotional efforts are all focused on highlighting these unique attributes, which set the country apart from the other East African member states, making a strong point for multi-country visits, to go home with a complete regional experience including having met Uganda’s primates and seen the majestic Rwenzori mountains. \nTripAdvisor recognition comes, unlike other industry awards which can literally be bought, as a result of user reviews and is broadly considered as much more impartial and fact based, giving them a special standing across the tourism industry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T09:38:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
