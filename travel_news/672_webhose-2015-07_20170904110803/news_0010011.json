They have called for setting up entertainment cities in the Kingdom similar to those around the world. \"No doubt entertainment has great importance in an individual's life as it provides a break in the otherwise hectic and tiresome schedule. Entertainment is required not only for kids but also for adults to bring joy to their lives and enable them to perform their duties efficiently,\" said physician Lamia Al-Fahad.Speaking about the shortcomings of entertainment places in Saudi Arabia, Mashael Al-Otaibi, a college student, said: \"Entertainment facilities here are outdated and poor in addition to strict laws that are in place and over-inflated fees. I have not visited these places during the last five years due to lack of new and attractive games.\"Another college student complained that entertainment places and theme parks have unjustified rules such as the prevention of food and drinks. In addition, taking photos are prohibited and there are strict controls on clothes and the general appearance of visitors.Nada Salem, a teacher, said: \"There is a lack of investment in entertainment cities in the Kingdom despite the community's need for such projects. Places of entertainment and theme parks are old and most of them are available for women only which prevent all family members from enjoying together.\"Giving her opinion, Maha Al-Anzi said that no improvement had occurred in places of entertainment and theme parks since their establishment several years ago and they provide low services with high prices. The entertainment cities here lack infrastructure and innovative games sufficient to meet the aspirations of community members.Rawan Ismail said entertainment activities are significant in human life, as there is a strong link between mind and physical health. She added that the importance of entertainment lies in an individual's need to rest and be relieved from everyday pressures and social and work obligations.
