I freqently revisit the critical question: 'Am I truly prepared and fully equipped with the skills that are needed for the real world?' I have no idea what employers or those working in admissions are looking for. There is a noticeable gap in the UK between employers and schools, which means students are frequently unaware of the essential skills and qualities that employers and universities are searching for. How do I stand out from my peers? What skills do I have to offer that will differ from the person applying for the same job or course as me? What skills am I able to offer that I’ve grasped over the years of being in the education system that will push me just that bit further? \"There is a brewing crisis across the UK as students are failing to meet the growing demand for higher skills.\" Danae Stewart Students are graded by their ability (or inability) to promote themselves and their intelligence through writing for two and half hours straight. It’s an outdated, narrow and unfair approach to education. As school head, Peter Hyman, wrote earlier this week , in no other walk of life is anyone's ability or intelligence assessed by purging out all the material they’ve gathered from reading the same textbook eight hours a day for six months. A student's ability to tell you everything they know about Henry the VIII and his six wives in 150 minutes says very little about their value as a potential employee. There is a crisis brewing across the UK as students are failing to meet the growing demand for higher skills. A recent report showed that British school leavers are the worst in Europe for essential skills and that’s because of learning methods such as ‘SOCA TOA’, timed questions, controlled assessments and the mantra of ‘read and remember’ being drilled into students. Skills such as problem solving, quick thinking and project pitching are essential areas that are nowhere to be found in the curriculum. Equally, information about apprenticeships remains elusive in schools throughout the UK. Apprenticeships are one option that schools can emphasise It seems as though schools and teachers only seem to care about ‘the numbers’ and getting as many students into Russell Group universities as they can. Instead they should be taking the time to supply students with substantial careers advice and helping them to carefully look at which post-18 route would be best suited to them and their abilities. There is a wrongly placed stigma on apprenticeships, which affects the way students feel about them. Going to university is not the only way into the working world and choosing not to go does not devalue your intelligence or ruin your chances of a successful career. \"For months I was ashamed of not wanting to go straight to university, due to the way it’s been drilled into me that the options are only going to university or amounting to nothing.\" Danae Stewart Going to university and doing an apprenticeship are equal - the new level six and seven apprenticeships are equivalent to bachelor's and master's degrees. Apprenticeships are spoken of as though they are a true alternative, and yet in schools it can seem like they hardly exist. I hope to become a documentary film maker and have had my heart set on applying to either Durham to study English, or applying to study English and film at Warwick. However, I just don’t feel adequately prepared. My teachers are still pushing university even though going straight to university may not be the best option for me. I do want to go, and I know that eventually I will, but at the moment I can’t help but feel as though I am lacking in areas needed to fully utilise my time at university. For months I was ashamed of not wanting to go straight to university, due to the way it’s been drilled into me. But university will always be there, and deciding to go down a different path doesn’t mean that I won’t amount to anything. It just means I am giving myself time to mature and find the skills needed in the real world that I personally didn’t obtain during education. You can download the Telegraph Apprenticeship App here.
