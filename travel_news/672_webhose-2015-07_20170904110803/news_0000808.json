With its friendly people, stunning beaches, romantic landscapes and picturesque backdrops, the kingdom is a charming place to “tie the knot” or enjoy a honeymoon and make memories that will last a lifetime.\nThe Romantic Thailand contest, a unique international project, was launched in May 2015. Loving couples from Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine were invited to take part in the online competition. A total of 122 couples submitted their heartwarming love stories to www.romanticthailand.tv.\nMrs. Juthaporn Rerngronasa, TAT Acting Governor and Deputy Governor for International Marketing (Europe, Africa, Middle East and Americas) said, “We would like to extend our warmest congratulations to the six winning couples. We are sure their stay in Thailand will leave them with a lifetime of wonderful memories. We would also like to thank all our project partners, especially Turkish Airlines and Bangkok Airways, for their cooperation.”\nIn a publicity pitch, Miss Eumporn Jiragalwisul, TAT Moscow Director said, “We want to tell loving couples from different countries about the ideal place to spend their most memorable weddings and magical “honeymoon.” Any couple can survive an amazing wedding adventure because the main condition for participation in the project is to be in love with each other and with Thailand.”\nAfter arriving in Bangkok on 28 July, 2015, the couples have spent two days touring the sights and sounds of Bangkok; such as, the Grand Palace and the evening show at Asiatique the Riverfront.\nOn 31 July, 2015, they will travel to Phuket, Krabi, and Phang Nga, where they will spend the rest of their trip. Their itinerary will include a Muay Thai class at AKA Thailand Camp, Wat Chalong, the Baba traditional wedding home in Phuket Old Town, a trip to Railay Beach, Ko Hong, Wat Suwan Kuha as well as Lamru Waterfall and so on.\nOn 8 August, 2015, the couples will have their “Amazing Thai Wedding” followed by dinner at an exclusive Thai restaurant. On 9 August, 2015, the couples will leave for home.\nAlthough Russia is facing economic challenges, TAT is continuing to maintain a marketing presence there in anticipation that the Russian economy will recover soon. The TAT Moscow office is promoting the “2015 Discover Thainess” campaign, which highlights the Thai way of life, Thai culture, and Thai experience for travellers. Moreover, TAT Moscow is undertaking partner-on-demand activities with many travel agencies and tour operators.\nThis particular itinerary of the “Romantic Thailand” contest was designed to grow the interest of Russian and CIS visitors in visiting Thailand as the wedding and honeymoon quality destination.\nSource:- TAT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T13:51:00.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
