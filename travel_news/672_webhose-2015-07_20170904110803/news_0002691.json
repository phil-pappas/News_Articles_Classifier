Here are some of them. Trang breakfast Legend has it that this robust breakfast was the Chinese settlers working at the Rubber plantations preferred way to begin the day and energy up for long hours of diligent farm work... and hearty it is. There are many eateries all over Trang city that offer this! Ordering is simple; every table has a number assigned with a mound of papers with that number printed on the back. All you need to do is go to the unsteamed dim sum food station and place your order. This paper is stuck to your stack of bamboo trays when they are sited over the steam. Another station takes orders for Thai coffee or tea. A must try is also 'pa tong go', a kind of X-shaped deep fried bread. 'Moo yang', a slightly sweet, slightly crisp form of grilled pork with the fat layers and skin is another hot favourite and of course you can order noodles with Roast Duck and even fried rice. Welsh free-range The Welsh cook from the heart, using fresh and simple ingredients. The significant thing with a Welsh breakfast is that all the ingredients are Welsh. It is imperative that the bacon is dry cure organic or else the meat leaks white residue everywhere. Organic, free-range eggs, which have been sourced from the neighbourhood, and served lightly fried, with sunny side up, cockles and laver bread cakes are two quintessential Welsh items on the menu. One of the most enduring Welsh customs is the weekly bake and items like 'bara birth' aka speckled bread eaten on its own, buttered or with cheese. Interestingly, ewes' milk (sheep's milk) is used to produce gorgeous yoghurt and cheeses and goat's milk cheeses are also widely available. Nasi lemak The best way to commence one's day is to start it with a plateful of 'Nasi lemak', swear most Malaysians. Truly this dish is wholesome and one can relish the full-bodied aroma of rice cooked in coconut milk, boosted with spices such as ginger, star anise and cinnamon accompanied with fried anchovies, poached eggs, spicy sambal curry, fresh slices of cucumber, crunchy groundnuts and Rendang (thick meat curry). 'Roti Canai' is a native preferred served at most hotel breakfast buffets, savoured with meat, chicken curry or dalca (vegetable curry). Also known as 'the flying bread', it's great to watch the experts' pound, stretch and toss the dough and then cook it to perfection on a griddle. Irish local produce An Irish breakfast is not something to just grab and gobble. The traditional Full Irish Breakfast encompasses a big plate of fresh, local farm produce all prepared in heaps of creamy butter and aided with a side of juice and a robust breakfast tea; with bacon, sausage, white and black pudding, beans, eggs, mushrooms, tomatoes, potatoes, homemade Soda bread, which is rustic and authentic, butter and jam as accompaniments. It's certainly enough to fuel a hefty human for a long day of work. What's black and white pudding, you may ask. It's essentially a type of sausage made with blood, meat, fat, oatmeal and bread or potato (black version includes blood and the white one does not). Spanish feast It is not easy to outline what a characteristic Spanish breakfast is, because of numerous regions with very unlike habits. That said, transiting by a typical Spanish cafe in the morning you will come across people drinking their morning coffee with tostada, pan con tomate, tortilla or bocadillo (a sandwich made lengthwise). Along with sandwiches and omelette (this one has potatoes in it), different kind of sweet bun can accompany your morning cafe, the most famous being the 'Churros'.
