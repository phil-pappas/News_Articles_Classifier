(Mary Altaffer/Associated Press) By Verena Dobnik | AP July 3 at 1:20 PM NEW YORK — Newlyweds Valasia Limnioti and Konstantinos Patronis’ long-planned “dream trip” to the U.S. ended in New York City, where their three-week honeymoon quickly turned into a nightmare: Their Greek-issued credit and debit cards were suddenly declined and they were left penniless.\n“We were hungry, and I cried for two days,” Limnioti said. “I felt homeless in New York.”\nThe couple skipped a few meals before spending their last dollars on dinner at McDonald’s. Strangers from two Greek Orthodox churches in the city’s Queens borough came to the rescue, giving them survival cash until their flight home to Greece on Friday.\nThe couple’s U.S. adventure started after their June 6 wedding in Volos, Greece, a port city several hours north of Athens.\nTheir coast-to-coast U.S. trip that took in Los Angeles and a Caribbean cruise “was the dream trip of our lives,” Limnioti said.\nThey had saved for a whole year to pre-pay for flights and hotels, with enough cash left for both necessities and pleasures. Two Greek banks issued them cards before the trip — a Visa credit card and a debit card. In Greece, they generally pay in cash, which is preferred by businesses, but they were told to have cards for the U.S.\n“Everything was all right — then ‘boom!’ in New York,” Limnioti said.\nTheir midtown Manhattan hotel asked them to pay a $45 surcharge. That’s when their cards bounced. They paid with their dwindling funds.\nWithin days, the couple ran out of cash and “we couldn’t withdraw any money — zero,” Limnioti said.\nOn Tuesday, in despair, they reached out to the New York-based Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, which contacted the churches in Queens’ Astoria neighborhood.\nThe honeymooners were offered about $350 from the St. Demetrios Greek Orthodox church and another nearby one, St. Irene Chrysovalantou.\n“I said to them, ‘Don’t worry, that’s why we’re here,’” said the Rev. Vasilios Louros of St. Demetrios. “This is the church of Christ and we always help people.”\nThe money was withdrawn from the church’s bank account, “and that was it,” he said.\nIn addition, an undisclosed amount came from a New York-based Greek journalist who hails from Volos.\nThe couple insisted they’d pay back the money but were told it was a gift, said Limnioti, speaking on her cellphone Wednesday from the American Museum of Natural History.\nShe said relatives in Greece told them other Greeks abroad also were left penniless, including some patients in U.S. hospitals who cannot pay for medical care.\nShe said she’s speaking out “because we Greeks are a proud people, and I want the world to know that we are not in this situation because we’re lazy or did something wrong.”\nTheir financial woes won’t be over once they get home.\nWith banks closed, Greece faces a deep financial crisis. Greeks will vote Sunday in a referendum on whether to back more spending cuts, more tax increases and more negotiations with European creditors. A rejection of such draconian measures could trigger a Greek exit from the Eurozone.\nLimnioti, 36, is unemployed after the small business for which she worked failed. Her 39-year-old husband still has his job as a helicopter engineer for the Greek military.\nBut in every sense, the couple’s honeymoon is over, with a financial sword of Damocles looming over their country.\n“There are only three things saving us now: our families, our friends and our God,” Limnioti said.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show the first name of the St. Demetrios reverend as Vasilios, not Vasillios.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
