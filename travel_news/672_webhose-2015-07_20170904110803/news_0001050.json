( NASDAQ : EPAX ) announced on July 13, 2015 that it will cease operations and close its student and adult travel business by the end of 2015. As previously reported, the Company will begin downsizing its staff and operations on July 27, 2015. These efforts are estimated to be largely complete by the end of August 2015. A small staff will manage the wind down of operations during the fourth quarter of the year. The Company's board of directors is evaluating efficient ways to distribute all excess cash to its shareholders. The amount of any such distribution and its timing cannot be estimated at this time, as the Company is preparing final payments for travel vendors as part of its peak travel season, as well as estimating other closing costs and funds needed to shut down the business. \nThe Company uses deployable cash as a liquidity measure, which is calculated as the sum of cash, cash equivalents, short-term available-for-sale securities and prepaid program costs and expenses, less the sum of accounts payable, accrued expenses and other short-term liabilities (excluding deferred taxes) and participant deposits. The Company believes the deployable cash measurement is useful in understanding cash available to deploy for current and future business opportunities, as it represents an estimate of excess cash available for capital deployment. This non-GAAP measure is based on assumptions and should not be construed as the maximum amount of cash sources available to run the business. \nAs of June 30, 2015, deployable cash was approximately $45.3 million, up from $31.7 million at March 31, 2015. During the third quarter of each year (July to September), deployable cash traditionally increases as summer travel is complete and the majority of the Company's travel revenue has been recognized with minimal liability balances remaining to complete payment for summer travel program costs. Deployable Cash Reconciliation (in thousands) Cash, cash equivalents and short-term available-for-sale securities Prepaid program cost and expenses \nThe Company expects to amend its July 14 8-K filing to include a range of estimated exit costs. The Company expects to make such amendment next week. Also, the Company will provide its full second-quarter earnings report as scheduled in August. \nABOUT AMBASSADORS GROUP, INC. \nAmbassadors Group, Inc.
