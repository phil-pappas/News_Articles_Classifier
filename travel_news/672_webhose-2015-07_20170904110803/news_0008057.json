The new addition raises the number of destinations in Saudi Arabia to five: Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam and Medina, besides Tabuk.\nThe new route increases the frequency of flights between Jordan and Saudi Arabia to around 60 weekly: 12 to Riyadh, 28 to Jeddah, 10 to Dammam, seven to Medina in addition to the two weekly flights to Tabuk.\nRJ will operate its one-hour service between Amman and Tabuk on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The aircraft will take off from Queen Alia International Airport, Amman, at 18:30 and arrive in Tabuk at 19:30. It will take off from Tabuk at 20:15 and land in Amman at 21:15.\nLaunching the new route in Saudi Arabia is part of the airlineâ€™s new strategy, which focuses at this phase on boosting services and operations in the Middle East and the Arab Gulf; this includes reaching new destinations and/or increasing frequency to current destinations.\nOperations to Tabuk are in response to the growing air transportation between the two kingdoms, which serves Jordanians, Arabs and international citizens working in Tabuk.\nSaudis living in the north of Saudi Arabia will also be able to visit Amman and travel beyond on the RJ route network or those of the oneworld carriers.\nTravel between Tabuk and Amman is a smooth and comfortable way for a large number of citizens of the northern part of Saudi Arabia to reach Jordan seeking medical treatment. Jordan is known for its medical tourism at regional and international levels.\nAir access to Amman will spare passengers the trouble of traveling overland, especially during the Hajj and Umrah seasons, when crossing the borders may take longer time due to the very busy traffic.\nRelated Posts Antalya Royal Jordanian flies between Amman and Tabuk from mid-July MIA Director, National Counterparts Travel To Washington, D.c.
