In particular, rates for the police-reported crimes, excluding traffic, of child pornography (up 41 per cent), terrorism (up 39 per cent), extortion (up 16 per cent), identity fraud (up 8 per cent), sexual violations against children (up 6 per cent) and abduction (up 4 per cent), Statistics Canada reports.\n—with files from thestar.com\nMore on thestar.com\nF.B.I. say it is too early to know If Chattanooga gunman was radicalized\nVeteran MPP to resign seat so new Progressive Conservative Leader Patrick Brown can run", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:17:36.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
