Fern Mallis, Brooke Shields, and Public School designers Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne were all in the crowd. “I’ve been working in Europe for a few months and my flight landed at 3 a.m. this morning,” art consultant Stacy Engman said. “I’ve come to this party for six years in a row and was not about to miss one now!”\nThe offbeat benefit fosters devotion in more than a few annual attendees. While Wilson shuffles the performance art pieces every year, the concept is the same: Cocktails are served on a guided walk through the woods surrounding the premises, where guests explore a dozen or so performance art pieces at their leisure. This year’s offerings? The theme was “Circus of Stillness...The Power Over Wild Beasts,” so naturally there were four handsome young men asleep in beds; a woman wrapped in tinfoil standing under a deluge of rainfall; and one man covered in paint rolling around on a white canvas.\n“I mean, we are standing in the forest, staring at a guy with a fish tied to his back,” began Daniel Arsham, an alum of the Center’s residency program for young artists. “Robert is really the only person who can galvanize so many people for a party like this. For me, he is one of the foremost theatrical minds of our time. To be around that, in a place as beautiful as this, is truly amazing.”\nCultivating a devoted crop of supporters is paying off—the evening raised just shy of $2 million.\nPsst…did you hear?
