Four years earlier, the airline called off its non-stop service to New York.\nServices on profitable routes to London and Frankfurt will be doubled to 14 flights per week, Jarumporn said.\nHe said the flight schedule changes and other measures were being introduced after the state-owned carrier entered a rehabilitation plan earlier this year. Its losses have swelled in recent years.\nThe carrier posted a net loss of 15.6 billion baht ($445 million) last year, about 30 per cent higher than 2013.\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T16:31:18.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
