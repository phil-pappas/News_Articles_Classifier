There are dozens of rules and regulations from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that guide the actions of pilots. Let’s answer some basic questions about what’s required of U.S. pilots according to these regulations.\nOne question is how many hours does a pilot need to fly for a major and regional airline.\nIn the United States, pilots need to accumulate 1,500 hours of flight time, 500 hours of cross-country flight time, 100 hours of night flight time, and 75 hours instrument operations time, either in a simulator or actual flights in order to earn their airline transport pilot (ATP) certificate . That certificate allows pilots to fly for Part 121 scheduled air carriers , which includes the major and regional airlines.\nAnother question is what type of medical certification must pilots have in order to fly. According to the FAA , they must hold a first-class medical certificate when serving as pilot-in-command or co-pilot while holding an ATP certificate. Among the things FAA medical examiners check are: distant visual acuity of 20/20 or better in each eye separately, with or without corrective lenses and near vision of 20/40 or better, Snellen equivalent, at 16 inches in each eye separately, with or without corrective lenses; demonstrate acceptable hearing; no medical history or diagnosis of disease or symptoms including epilepsy, a loss of control of nervous system function(s) without satisfactory medical explanation or seizures; and no established medical history or clinical cardiovascular diagnosis including Myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease that has required treatment, cardiac valve replacement, a pacemaker or a heart replacement.\nWhen it comes to mental health, the FAA says that a pilot cannot have an established medical history or clinical diagnosis of issues including: a personality disorder that is severe enough to have repeatedly manifested itself by overt acts; a psychosis that has manifested delusions, hallucinations, grossly bizarre or disorganized behavior, or other commonly accepted symptoms of this condition; a bipolar disorder; substance dependence on alcohol, sedatives and hypnotics, and central nervous system stimulants such as cocaine, amphetamines, hallucinogens, cannabis and other psychoactive drugs and chemicals; and a verified positive drug test result, an alcohol test result of 0.04 or greater alcohol concentration, or a refusal to submit to a drug or alcohol test required by the U.S. Department of Transportation.\nPilots do undergo a mental health screening when they’re hired by an airline, but after that, there is no formal mental screening protocols in place for those holding first class medical certificates. Aviation Medical Examiners who give the required six-month checkups for pilots over the age of 40 and yearly for those under 40 can ask questions about mental health and stress. Pilots are required to reveal any mental issues, and most self-diagnose.\nAnother big question is how are cockpits kept safe. After 9/11, the FAA issued new standards to protect cockpits from intrusion, guns and small explosive devices like grenades. Airlines were required to install reinforced doors on all commercial aircraft with 20 or more seats.\nThe doors were required to be designed to resist intrusion by someone attempting to force their way into the cockpit. Cockpit doors were required to remain locked and designed to prevent passengers from opening it without the pilot's permission by using an internal locking device. The FAA also requires two crew members to be in the cockpit at all times. If the pilot or co-pilot needs to leave, a flight attendant must go into the cockpit.", "external_links": ["https://www.faa.gov/pilots/training/atp/", "https://www.faa.gov/pilots/amelocator/", "http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?type&#61;simple;c&#61;ecfr;cc&#61;ecfr;sid&#61;85f2f758c7572cf6fd784c355d1c55a1;idno&#61;14;region&#61;DIV1;q1&#61;61.23;rgn&#61;div8;view&#61;text;node&#61;14%3A2.0.1.1.2.1.1.17", "https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/atos/air_carrier/", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/W/Q/M/cockpit-100624_640.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/Q/M/cockpit-100624_640.jpg", "http://cryptome.org/faa-cocksec.htm", "http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID&#61;3ce9d9d0a29a3eb08ee91e5cd1957d95&node&#61;sp14.2.67.b&rgn&#61;div6"], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T07:10:00.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
