Redwood City, California-based AltspaceVR was founded in 2013, and including an initial $5.4 million round in 2014, has now raised $15.7M in total capital.\nAltspace bills itself as “the social VR company,” and makes virtual reality communication software that allows people to share content and experiences in a virtual online environment. Users appear as avatars that resemble robots within a variety of different settings, ranging from high-tech cinemas to to Japanese tea gardens. Once there they can converse over voice chat, watch streaming video from services including Netflix and Twitch, and even play tabletop games against each other.\nJust last week, the company unveiled its latest virtual space, a fantasy-themed tavern, along with a new application it calls V20 , a fantasy role-playing game system for virtual reality. The software provides players with a virtual battle grid, polyhedral dice, and a soundboard for dynamic music, and is compatible with tabletop RPG systems like Dungeons & Dragons.\nA player considers the battle grid in AltspaceVR’s new V20 virtual role-playing game space.

CEO Eric Romo says the company will continue to develop and expand the software, but has no immediate plans to leave beta and launch a final commercial version.\nThe market for virtual reality products is currently booming in advance of several highly anticipated VR headsets due to hit stores in the coming year, including the Facebook-owned Oculus Rift , Sony’s Project Morpheus , and the Valve and HTC co-developed Vive .\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "external_links": ["http://altvr.com/tabletop-role-playing-games-now-in-altspacevr/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Vive", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Morpheus_(virtual_reality)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_Rift"], "published": "2015-07-29T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T14:33:45.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
