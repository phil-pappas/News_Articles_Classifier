I’m being robbed! Someone is rummaging through my jacket pocket. Nervously, I look over my shoulder but there’s no pickpocket to be seen – only a big bull elephant with enormous tusks.\nWhat’s more, its trunk is exploring my pocket. I can’t say I wasn’t warned. Scrolling through a long list of diversions in a place calling itself “Africa’s adventure capital”, I pick what seems a memorable choice: walking with elephants.\nThese aren’t the smaller domesticated pachyderms of Asia. They’re African elephants, Earth’s biggest land mammals, which are increasingly involved in tourism-related activities.\nFirst comes my safety briefing. Six of us are handed small cloth bags filled with pellet-like snacks to feed the beasts on our 30-minute walks.\n“Keep these snacks ready,” a Zambian guide warns. “If you’re too slow the elephant may get impatient and start searching your body with its trunk.”\nWe amble down a scrubby trail, each leading an elephant. Some of the animals were born in captivity, others in the wild. Canoeing on the Zembezi River. Picture: Getty Source: Getty Images\nSomehow my elephant and I become separated from the others. It’s just the two of us. I totally forget about the snacks. Then I feel the mysterious ferreting in my pocket.\nLater, our elephants sit in a line so we can be photographed with them. Sitting on an elephantine foreleg, I marvel at the memory that, in the bush, I’d thought of the creature as my protector rather than a potential killer.\nThe town of Livingstone’s other offered activities encompass safaris on elephant back, hikes through national parks, visits to tribal villages, abseils down a gorge, zip-line trips between treetops, game-fishing for razor-toothed tiger fish, whitewater rafting, kayaking on the mighty Zambezi and horseback excursions into the hinterland. But it’s Victoria Falls that entices most travellers.\nMany visitors are content to view them vantage points, waft above them by balloon or skim across by low-level helicopter.\nBut some prefer twin vistas of this African gem with related thrills for which Livingstone is renowned – for instance, seeing the falls from microlight aircraft or motorised hang-gliders.\nThe best-known adventure in these parts is bungy-jumping from Victoria Falls Bridge, which spans the Zambezi, the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe – a 111m plunge.\nZimbabwe, wedged between South Africa and Zambia, traditionally was where you’d go to see the falls – with Zambia an ultra-poor relation. Truth to tell, the view from the Zimbabwean side is better, but only just and there aren’t as many diversions. White-water rafting on the Zambesi below Victoria Falls.

Instead, the action has moved across the border.\nZambia cleverly took up the slack about a decade ago. Zambian tourism has blossomed. The country cheekily markets itself as “home of the Victoria Falls” and promotes Livingstone as “Africa’s adventure capital”. At the same time it somehow manages to maintain good relations with Zimbabwe.\nAirports on each side of the border are only a few kilometres apart, with both offering non-stop flights to South Africa’s Johannesburg (the easiest access point from Australia).\nShunning a boisterous sunset “booze cruise”, I instead board the African Princess , which like its larger sister, African Queen, offers relaxing “sundowner cruises”. From an on-deck wicker armchair I order a local Mosi beer and watch elephants on the river bank as we pass Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park. I can’t help thinking that in these faux-colonial surrounds a tall gin and tonic would have been more appropriate.\nEarlier, I had joined walkers on a trail into the 66sq km park for sightings of elephants, hippos, zebras, giraffes and antelopes – but there are no predators. (Nearby Stanley and Livingstone Private Game Reserve boasts the introduced Big Five (elephants, lions, leopards, buffaloes and rhinos, of which seven are ultra-rare black rhinos) as well as leopards, cheetahs, hyenas, apes, antelopes and other creatures.\nThe name Mosi-oa-Tunya is oft-heard in these parts. It means the “smoke that thunders”, the name by which the falls were known until colonial explorer David Livingstone saw them in 1855 and named them after the British queen . The title Victoria Falls was quickly popularised.\nBack at my hotel I don’t have to worry about a pickpocket. Instead, I’m the target of delightful peeping toms. Victoria Falls seen from Zambia. Zimbabwe Picture: Getty Source: Getty Images\nThe complex – fenced, with non-dangerous animals roaming within – houses two hotels, upscale Royal Livingstone and mid-market Zambezi Sun. It’s an easy 10-minute amble along a private pathway to the falls.\nMy bedroom curtains are open. Outside is a lush garden and a face is peering through the window. It’s joined by another which also eyeballs me.\nI’m enchanted. The peeping toms are zebras and I’m as fascinated by them as they are\nby me. I watch them watching me for 10 minutes before noticing a group of tourists heading for the falls.\nI see spray in the distance (it’s sometimes visible from 7km away) and decide I’ve time for one more visit.\nA dollar buys me a disposable raincoat from a vendor. Several visitors don’t bother and are instantly drenched.\nMoments later I discard my raincoat, feeling liberated by tropical wetness and the deafening roar of the “smoke that thunders” – Africa’s most spectacular natural wonder.\nThe writer was a guest of South African Airways and the Zambia Tourism Board.\nGO2\nZAMBIA\nGETTING THERE\nSouth African Airways flies from Australia to Johannesburg, with Livingstone connections.\nSee flysaa.com\nSTAYING THERE\nBest-located hotels are two in the Sun International chain, Royal Livingstone and Zambezi Sun with a combined total of 385 rooms.\nA budget travellers’ option: Fawlty Towers, a combination of private rooms and backpacker dormitories with lively bar. It handles bookings for numerous adventurous diversions.\nSee suninternational.com , adventure-africa.com (for Fawlty Towers).\nTOURING THERE\nA popular side-trip is South Luangwa National Park, with four of the Big Five (no rhinos). Other game includes zebras, giraffes, hippos, crocodiles, baboons, hyenas and many types of antelopes\nThe Bushcamp Company operates six small luxury lodges in the park and arranges guided walking safaris between some. Between October and December elephant families often wander through the lobby of one of these, Mfuwe Lodge, on an age-old route to feast on wild mangoes - and unfazed by a the presence of a lobby.\nA night or two in Lusaka, the capital, is worthwhile to experience a bustling African city.\nSee bushcampcompany.com\nWHEN TO GO\nSub-tropical Zambia is a year-round destination. March to mid-May offer the heaviest surges of water over Victoria Falls. Late May to October is the “dry season”. September and October, late in the dry season, are particularly good for animal sightings. December to April is the “green” or rainy season, worst for game-viewing because dense bush shrouds wildlife (and some lodges close). Peak tourist season is June, July and August - with cool nights and higher prices in what’s generally a moderately priced country.\nSee zambiatourism.com", "external_links": ["http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/02/1227425/252338-8c768722-1ef3-11e5-a8f7-6a674378a2fe.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/02/1227425/251373-8714f318-1ef3-11e5-a8f7-6a674378a2fe.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/02/1227425/251401-889f0570-1ef3-11e5-a8f7-6a674378a2fe.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-04T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T05:07:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
