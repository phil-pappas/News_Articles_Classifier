Always on the lookout for new activities to keep their young daughter Darcey – a lively, energetic five-year-old – amused, they decided to go along. “I’m so pleased we did,” says border enforcement officer Zoe, 35. “Darcey was completely taken with the whole thing and we all had great fun – so much so that we signed her up for tennis lessons at the club. She’s now a really keen player.” The Bootes live in Plymouth, where David, 34, is a petty officer with the Royal Navy. They attended the open day at Plympton Tennis Club last year as visitors; when the club opened its courts again to the public for another GBTW event last month, father and daughter demonstrated their skills to impress potential new members. “Both occasions were fantastic,” says Zoe, “but this year it was really lovely for David and Darcey to be able to show other people what fun tennis can be, whatever your age. She really loved the relaxed approach they took and enjoyed playing with the other children, so she was keen to do more \"When Darcey picked up a racquet at the first open day we went to she must have had 100 balls thrown at her, and I’m sure she only managed to hit one back. But the atmosphere was such that it didn’t matter – it was all about having a go. “She really loved the relaxed approach they took and enjoyed playing with the other children, so she was keen to do more. Now she has lessons each week, and is mixing with children of all ages and abilities. “Meanwhile, David and I have made friends with some of the other parents. There’s a lovely sense of community. \"David and Darcey played in the parent and child tournament, which they didn’t win but they had a really good time taking part in. It was nice they could play as a team in doubles matches – it was a lovely, bonding experience for them both.” When Darcey isn’t having lessons at the club, she plays at home with family and friends. Zoe says: “We have plenty of room for her to practise the skills she’s learning. At the club it’s made to feel more like playing games than learning tennis skills – she comes home shattered after all the running they do.\" Darcey says: “I like playing tennis because it’s not just for boys, but girls too. Also, we play a game called \"fruit salad\" which means lots of running around.” Tennis is an interest she can enjoy that will help keep her fit and healthy and provide lots of outdoor exercise that’s great fun Zoe adds: “What I really like about tennis is the fact that, even though David and I don’t formally play, we can still knock a ball about with her and enjoy quality time together. \"When grandparents come they do the same, and if she has friends round she tries to give them a lesson. What other sport can you enjoy on that basis? You just need a racquet and a ball and you’re off.” Zoe also likes the fact that it’s a way to keep Darcey entertained that doesn’t involve a computer screen or television. “You have to work quite hard to keep them busy these days so that they don’t end up stuck inside, playing on technology,” she says. “By getting her involved with tennis we’ve given her another interest that she can enjoy that will help keep her fit and healthy and provides lots of outdoor exercise that’s great fun. “She might never find herself on the courts at Wimbledon, but that’s not the point. This is about Darcey enjoying herself, which she certainly does. \"Meanwhile, I’ve seen several children who attended the open day having lessons since. It’s great to be part of something that is growing all the time.” Find out where you can play tennis for free with event locator", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T12:58:06.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
