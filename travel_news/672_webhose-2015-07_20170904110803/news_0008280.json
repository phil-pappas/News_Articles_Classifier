Adv: \nSeychelles President James Michel visited several businesses on Praslin island in the district of Baie Ste. Anne this morning, which forms part of a series of visits to various communities and businesses this year. \nPresident Michel met with a young man who has his own bakery at home and who hopes to build a bakery nearby in the near future. Mr. Michel visited two gyms in the district, where he spoke to the gym owners about the demand for health and fitness products and services and their plans to expand their services in new premises. The President also visited a farm, where he spoke with the farm owner concerning his business needs and constraints. He then visited an art gallery at Cote D’Or, where he viewed the art works of Praslinois artists who are being promoted by a young artist and entrepreneur. \nFollowing his visit, the President said that he believes that the future of Seychelles is in the empowerment of Seychellois so that they can enter into the economic development of the country and take ownership of the economy. \n“This is the key to the future. Today, after the economic reforms, for which we have been admired the world over, we need to maintain this and develop it further. Our wealth needs to grow, to go further for us to be able to do more good for our people. … Now that we have established the platform of a stable economy, we need to empower Seychellois to do business and create wealth… for this reason I have put a lot of emphasis during the last two years on development of business in Seychelles - big business, medium-size business, and small business… many are run by young people who have taken the opportunity to grow. This is the future of Seychelles,” said the President. \nHe said that young people are finding ways to develop themselves and are working hard, adding that he was inspired by the businesses he saw on Praslin where he noticed there is a thirst for growth among the entrepreneurs he met as they are doing well. The President said that it is an encouragement as it shows the results of the business creation efforts of the government’s programs as well as the improvements in the general business climate. \n\"It is mix of innovation and initiative, and I am very impressed! I would like to encourage other entrepreneurs on Praslin to continue in their good work, continue to initiate, to innovate,” said Mr. Michel. \nPresident James Michel was accompanied on the visit by the Minister for Investment, Entrepreneurship Development and Business Innovation, Mr. Michael Benstrong; the Principal Secretary for Enterpreneurship Development and Business Innovation, Mrs. Maryse Berlouis; the Member of the National Assembly for Baie Ste. Anne, the Hon. Natasha Esther; the District Administrator for Baie Ste.
