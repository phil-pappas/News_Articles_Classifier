The lobby of Canberra’s funkiest new hotel, Hotel Hotel. Source: Supplied \nCANBERRA has long been the butt of many jokes. A punching bag for Australia’s more esteemed cities. \n“Boring”, “no personality”, “a place to retire”, it’s forever been likened as a trip to grandma’s house. \nBut something’s changed in our capital. \nCould it be that Canberra has actually become cool? While we’ve all been busily avoiding the place, Canberrans have been chipping away at their image and quietly come to the forefront as sophisticated, quirky and somewhere you’d actually like to go. \nHere’s how Canberra got its groove back. \nBraddon \nOnce a former site for car yards, Braddon has become Canberra’s epicentre of cool. Hipsters have been working hard to bring funky restaurants, bars and cafes to the area including 86 and Italian & Sons. \nThe Hamlet is full of pop up stores and food vans. Eat your way through BrodDog, the Spit Shak, Chasing Mr Morris and more. Eightysix is one of Canberra’s hippiest new restaurants. Source: Facebook \nHotels \nThe 68-room Hotel Hotel looks like something from the Meatpacking district of New York. Its incredible design is the product of brothers Bectar and Johnathan Efkarpidis and it has brought edge and sophistication to Canberra. \nLocated in the New Acton precinct, its lobby is home to Monster bar — the go to place for a drink and filled with young hipsters, buzzing with energy. It has been intricately designed with an eclectic mix of furniture and art. \nNational Arboretum \nSo at first this sounds like something for the oldies. But it’s actually quite spectacular. One of Canberra’s newest attractions, the National Arboretum is a beautiful site built on the grounds devastated during the 2003 Canberra bushfires. \nOne hundred forests have been planted, but what is even more impressive is the visitor centre at the top of the hill offering unbeatable views over the city. The National Arboretum is a cool spot for a coffee with a view. Source: Facebook \nNew Acton \nUrban redevelopment has been a tough thing to get right. Melbourne’s Docklands has come under criticism for being a soulless ghost village, but Canberra’s award winning New Acton precinct has got it completely right. \nHome to Hotel Hotel, you’ll also find residential buildings, retail, office facilities and some of Canberra’s best restaurants and cafes. \nHigh Tea \nHigh tea is back in fashion and Canberra has its fair share of venues thanks to our British connection. But the best one in town has to be the traditional high tea at the Hyatt Hotel . \nCucumber finger sandwiches, scones and cake are complimented with a glass of the local sparkling and you’ll get to see the famous staff golf caddie uniform. The Hyatt blends modernity and tradition at its famous high tea.
