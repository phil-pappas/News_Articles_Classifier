NCR, Invest Atlanta and Cousins Properties have now closed on the incentive agreements, and Cousins on the acquisition of the land at Centergy North at Technology Square on Spring Street. Additionally, NCR and Cousins entered into a long-term, build-to-suit lease for the new campus facility at the site in Midtown that will be owned and developed by Cousins. \"I have stated very publicly that NCR's bold, ambitious move to establish a state-of-the-art world headquarters campus in Midtown is a critical first step in a larger goal to create a 'Silicon Valley of the East' right here in Atlanta,\" said NCR Chairman and CEO Bill Nuti. \"We are currently, and will continue, advocating for other tech leaders and innovative companies to follow our lead. NCR is committed to the City of Atlanta, State of Georgia, and the University System of Georgia. NCR will be a top employer and part of the fabric of this community for a very long time.\"\"Never has it been more apparent that the next generation of talent can be found here in Atlanta,\" said Mayor Kasim Reed. \"NCR has recognized the quality of the workforce here, and has made an investment which will pay dividends for decades. We look forward to building the future of technology with NCR.\"\"We are excited about the opportunity to develop NCR's new global headquarters in Atlanta. This 485,000 square foot state-of-the art trophy tower will be an iconic addition to the Midtown skyline,\" said Larry Gellerstedt, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cousins Properties. \"NCR's commitment to locating their world headquarters in Midtown further validates the strength of Atlanta's technology corridor. We are proud to have them as a customer and look forward to a strong relationship for years to come.\" 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T03:23:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
