After being impressed by the beauty of the Golfo Dulce, he decided to create an annual swim competition on the water in 2013.\nDuring the first two years of the race, there were two categories: a 1.5-kilometer swim and a 5-kilometer.\nThis year Bernini is including a new category: the 14-kilometer marathon swim. Cullell’s swim across the gulf was a test of the course.\nThe competition, which will take place September 12, is part of the World Open Water Swimming Series .\nBernini said he hopes the event will help promote Golfo Dulce as an adventure sport destination and help improve the local economy, especially during the low season. The event will also raise money for a program to teach English to local school children in order to improve their tourism job prospects.\nGolfo Dulce is rich in biodiversity. Humpback whales breed and calve there. It’s also prime habitat for spotted and bottlenose dolphin.\nFor more information on the race visit http://www.aventuras-golfo-dulce.co/english.html", "external_links": ["http://www.aventuras-golfo-dulce.co/english.html", "http://worldopenwaterswimmingseries.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/Cruce.Golfo.Dulce/timeline"], "published": "2015-07-18T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T05:56:42.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
