For travelers, this can be devastating.\nAccording to Leo Hamel of Security Brand VAULT, \"For the first time ever, digital theft is becoming the norm, and I don't think people are prepared. No one has to reach into your pocket any more to steal your cash or ID – including US passport information. They can be standing 2 or 3 feet from you with a scanner or a phone app and skim your data in a matter of seconds – and you may never know you've been a victim.\"\nAs the US banking industry is readying for a fall 2015 introduction of contactless debit and credit cards, and it expects a huge domestic spike of digital pickpocketing. In Europe and Canada, chip cards have been in circulation for some time branded for payment as PayPass, Zip, payWave, and ExpressPay. All of these cards are susceptible to electronic skimming.\nBut whether in the US or abroad, it is possible to stay safe on vacation without being a recluse or shunning crowded areas. Companies like VAULT are introducing hi-tech credit card protector sleeves that can be used to prevent both cash and identity theft. When credit card sleeves first appeared, they were made of tyvek, paper or plastic, and were designed to protect cards from de-magnetizing, but the older sleeves do nothing to protect new RFID chip technology.\nThe latest sleeves – like those made by VAULT and distributed in North America by Elk & Bear: Handpicked – are different. According to Hamel, \"Our credit card protectors use copper and aluminum to block Electromagnetic Interference from would be hackers. This construction has been approved for use by the US government as an RFID card and passport protection device. VAULT sleeves fit nicely into any standard wallet and also feel good in your hand. We've thought of everything because if people are going to take these on vacation, we want them to be a pleasure to use.\"\nAccording to Christina Butler of Elk and Bear: Handpicked, It's that attention to detail that makes them a prefect fit for the Elk and Bear Brand.\nVault Credit Card and Passport sleeves (set of 10 credit card and two passport) are available exclusively at Amazon.com, and currently on introductory special at 65% off MSRP for $14.95.\nAbout Elk & Bear: Handpicked\nElkandbear.com is on a mission to provide the best version of the lifestyle products consumers want.
