Or something. It was a tough old afternoon out there at St. Andrews and it's telling that the leading scores are those who went out early. Dustin Johnson was outstanding and you have to give credit to Zach Johnson and Paul Lawrie for some great golf too. Phil Mickelson may not be up there right now, but he fought brilliantly to play a proper veteran's round. The man of the day though has to be Danny Willett, who signed for a wonderful 66. We'll be back from around 7am tomorrow because our editors are cruel to us , when it's likely to be far trickier than it was earlier today, if the weather forecast is anything to go by. In the meantime, thanks for reading. Bye! -7: D Johnson (F) -6: Streb (F), Goosen (F), Lawrie (F), Day (F), Z Johnson (F), Willett (F) 2001 Ah Justin. His second shot finds the back of the green, about 20 yards from the flag. It's a poor putt though, playing for a break that was never there. He's got a tricky four-footer for par, but misses that right too. Either side of that, Fowler and Faldo two-putted for par, meaning they finish evens and 11 over respectively. Rose then completes the bogey from a couple of feet, meaning that on the back nine he slide from -4 to -1. He won't be happy. 1955 Incidentally Matt Kuchar made par at 18 and finished one under. We're going to wrap this up soon-ish, I think, as the final \"big name\" group of Faldo, Fowler and Rose are on the 18th now. Here's Mickelsen in action earlier. With any luck, this should give you some idea of how cold it is. 1951 Ashley Chesters makes a mess of the 16th, taking three putts and dropping a shot in the process. Four under for him, but still the leading English amateur. 1948 There's no birdie for Stenson , as his putt breaks fractionally right just at the last second. Mickleson 's effort is on a similar line but much closer, and he rolls it in to grab a birdie. That's Big Phil round in 69 by my reckoning, an excellent round late in the day. 1944 Lovely second shot on the 18th from Stenson , a fair way past the pin but then spinning back appreciably to give him a shot at a birdie. That's nothing compared with Mickelson though, who lands it about 15 feet away but shows wonderful spin control to get it within six. That should be a birdie to finish a good round from him. Rose is in a wee bit of trouble on the 17th, short of the green with his second. But a lovely chip on rolls just past the flag, leaving him with a six-footer for par. He nails it. 1940 I'd barely noticed Jamie Donaldson , who had reached a fuss-free two under through 16. Then he double bogeyed the 17th and said the eff word. The BBC are outraged I tells ya. A missed long, curving birdie putt on the final hole sees him home in a disappointing 72. 1934 The 17th claims another victim shot. Matt Kuchar , who's been consistent without actually looking all too certain of himself today, has a 12 footer for par but, like so many today, misses right. Back to -1 for him then. Mickelsen follows him with a closer putt for birdie, but it's a sharp right-to-left break down the hill and that does for his effort. We're north of The Wall and winter is coming 1929 Mickelsen , in case you were wondering, has made par six holes on the spin and remains two under. He's not dropped a shot on the back nine yet, which is remarkable. After a quick start he had a bit of a wobble, but has steadied himself since then. 1919 It's going to be at least one more dropped shot for Rose , as he chips from the bunker into a sunken part at the back of the green. It's a tricky one to make par at 16, and though it's a decent effort it doesn't turn and leaves him with an awkward four footer for bogie. Rickie Fowler , who is back to level par, drops just short with a long birdie putt on the same. Rose makes the bogie. On 18, Kaymer holds his nerve to sink a 20ft, flat birdie putt, which puts him in the red for the day. Adam Scott though holes an even longer one to make it two birdies from the last three holes. He cards a 70, which isn't bad having had the worst of the conditions. 1915 If anyone knows who Paul Dark is, do feel free to tweet @DanLucas86 or email dan.lucas86@gmail.com with the answer. 1909 More Justin Woes (sorry). He's in a bunker on the 16th as well now and faces a battle to save par. Still, he's doing better than Tiger Woods; here's what our very own Oliver Brown had to say about the long dethroned champ. The lamentable decline of Tiger Woods continues apace on the Old Course that was once his fiefdom. An abject opening round of 76, his worst competitive effort at St Andrews by a distance, was captured best by a mangled approach to the first that pitched straight into the Swilcan Burn. He held his head in anguish, as if he wanted the lush Fife fairway to swallow him whole. His friend and playing partner Jason Day, who eclipsed Woods’ score by 10 shots, spoke for many in saying: “I grew up watching him. He was my idol. And it’s tough to see your idol struggle.” Read the rest here . Go on, I'll wait for you. 1904 Stenson has a chance of a birdie at 17, but it's a long ol' putt over a bump; a good 30 yards or so I'd guess. Peter Alliss notes that St. Andrews in this light looks like someone called Paul Dark. I have no idea what on earth this means. Google tells me he is a lecturer at the University of Manchester, although Google Images gives me pictures of Jessie Pinkman from Breaking Bad . 1857 I'm back! And it looks like Rose has dropped a shot and is now in the bunker on the 15th, but he escapes it quite marvellously and should putt simply for par. It's worse though for Stenson, who was -2 when I left and is now level par through 16. And poor old Nick Faldo is +10. Still, good news for Danny Willett: &lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Alan Shearer - Great round of golf &lt;a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/Danny_Willett\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;@Danny_Willett&lt;/a&gt; keep it up. ð&amp;Yuml;&amp;lsquo;ð&amp;Yuml;»&lt;/noframe&gt; 1838 Before we get to the business end for the big names, I'm going to go and grab a sandwich. Back in 15 or so. 1833 Time to hear from Zach Johnson . \"I love what this tournament brings out in me, I love the fight,\" he says. \"You've gotta be an athlete... not that I'm a top level athlete.\" He had a cracking round of 66 today, with just the one blemish on the dreaded 17th. Also happy birthday to Adam Scott ! The Australian golfer, rather than the bloke out of Parks and Recreation . Not that one 1827 It's a fantastic finish to the day for Willett as he matches Zach Johnson in front of him, sinking a very similar putt to get a birdie. And indeed they finish with the same score of 66. On 14, Faldo has spent five minutes or so looking for his lost ball after awkwardly hitting a nasty hook into the long grass on the left of the fairway. He's +7, so advantage Tom Watson in the send-off stakes. 1817 Danny Willett fails to make the first birdie of the day on the 17th, but makes a clutch putt for par. In front of him, Johnson (Zee) makes a 15ft curling putt on the 18th to complete a round of 66 and rejoin that group of players behind his namesake. Par for his partner Fleetwood , who goes round in a three-under 69. Good round, but he still has rubbish hair. 1813 It looks like Paul Kinnear's glory could be short-lived, as Ashley Chesters makes eagle at 10 and birdie at 11 to shoot up to -5, making him the highest-placed English amateur out there. He does have that nasty run-in to counter yet, mind. 1803 It's all gone a bit quiet, if I'm honest. Rose and Mickelson are playing steadily, while Fowler nearly dropped to +2 but made a great save on 11. Stenson failed to do the same in the group before. Oh and as I write this, bad news for Zach Johnson as he picks up his first bogie of the day on 17 to go back to -5. That probably blows his chance of a clubhouse lead. 1753 Warren has a 20 yard putt on 18 to get to -5, but it stop agonisingly short. A few minutes and a hole back, Zach Johnson made another par of Wayne Jarvis-esque professionalism on 16, but was utterly eclipsed by Tommy Fleetwood raking in a 40 yarder for birdie. He too is four under par. 1743 Apologies folks, we had some technical difficulties there. While we were away, Marc Warren played a delightful little chip out of the bunker on 17, right up to the pin and gave himself an easy save for par. Not so good for Justin Rose then, who missed his easy birdie effort on 10. 1725 It's not gone well for Ogilvy either, dropping three shots across the 15th and 16th to slip back to -3. Justin Rose now has a huge putt for eagle on the 10th. It's a valiant effort, just four feet past. But then Fowler , +1 coming into this hole, is -1 coming out of it as he lines up a 20-yarder and sinks it for eagle. \"That's what they call a rapper's cap,\" says Peter Alliss, disapprovingly, of Rickie's baseball cap. 1722 Cripes. Faldo is putting from short of the green on 10 having landed short off the tee, and he pings it a good 20 yards past. Good news is, Nick sees the funny side of it and breaks out in a broad grin. He's enjoying his final Open. 1719 \"They don't get cold weather in Austria,\" says Peter Alliss, who appears to have genuinely confused it with Australia. Meanwhile, scandalous rumours from our friends over at the Guardian. &lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Ewan Murray - John Daly is -3. Heard a whisper he enjoyed a good few drops of bourbon at the champions' dinner.&lt;/noframe&gt; 1713 Bad news for Tommy Fleetwood as he three-puts to drop back to -3. On 10, both Stenson and Kuchar hit enormous drives right on to the green, while Mickelson goes with a three wood and drops short. Still, Phil gets up and down in three, while the others two-putt to register the same. 1708 Sadly it's another dropped shot for Faldo on the ninth, as his long, 20 yard par putt, slightly down the hill, is off target. He'll be +5 going into the back nine at least. Still, he'll always have the glory years. Rose holds for par and turns around four under. He's hit every green on the front nine in regulation. 1703 Ooh no my mistake, Rose is right on the lip of the bunker, just an inch short of the trap. He pops a lovely second shot into the wind and on to the green. 1700 Rose gives himself a chance for a second back-to-back birdie on eight, getting his tee shot into the wind pin high, but just slightly left. There's a bit of a break though, and Rose misses it. Still, par for him, which is one better than Fowler can make. On the next hole, Fowler is the only one to stay out of the sand as Rose and Faldo hit the bunker. 1656 Staying on nine, no one makes their long putt for birdie. Stenson is first up with the short putt for par and, after a long deliberation, he sinks it. Danny Willett , -5 through 14, has a great chance of a birdie on the next hole, clipping it pin high to within a few feet. 1655 ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS 1652 Zach Johnson knocks in a three footer for par on the 14th, keeping it very professional on this back nine. On nine, the trio of Mickelson, Kuchar and Stenson all continue to struggle with the wind and duff their respective second shots a good 25-30ft short of the pin. 1646 Another birdie for Justin Rose takes him to -4 through six. There's been nothing spectacular from him, but it's been a very steady and serene start. He'll need to keep that kind of nerve for the way back. 1642 Stenson and Mickelson have both registered bogies on the par-three eigth as they underestimated the wind. Matt Kuchar has a fairly simple putt from six feet to better them and save par, but he misses it. Oh dear. 1636 Jeff Ogilvy is up to within one of the lead with a birdie at 12. The top British amateur today was Formby's Paul Kinnear , who wobbled a bit on the back nine but came in with a respectable 70. He's \"absolutely made up\", which I think means pleased. My girlfriend's from the north - Liz, could you email in and confirm? Ta. 1631 Not that long ago, Fowler played a nice chip on to the sixth green to leave himself a 10-or-so-foot birdie putt. The BBC didn't bother showing it and why would they? We all knew it was going to miss by not much and indeed that was the case. Another par for him. Golfing hipster Tommy Fleetwood is keeping himself in the mix, knocking in a birdie at 12 to make it -4 for him. 1623 At 13, Johnson has misread the strength of the wind and lands short on the left. Not a problem though, as he gets out the fairway wood and sends a lovely low shot on to the enormous 13th green. It's 100 yards long at its longest point, that green. 1619 As Stenson seals that second birdie to move to -2, David Howell speaks. He's happy to have played the front nine in benign conditions and bemoans his choice of clothes in the cold. Very confident speak is Howell, with a voice that would be perfect for reading the TV weather forecast. 1616 Remarkably, Zach Johnson has a birdie chance on 12. It's not the easiest, a good dozen feet out, and he slides it just right. Good work to save par though. 1613 By reckoning it's time for the final group of Taichi Teshima, Robert Dinwiddie, Rikard Karlberg to get going. Stenson , on the sixth, has hit a monster of a three wood down the left of the fairway and knocked his approach shot to within six foot to give him an easy birdie chance. 1610 Birdie it is for Rose. Zach Johnson's ball on the 12th has gone the way of good Simpsons episodes and disappeared. Nothing like the wind on this back nine for stalling momentum. 1606 Time for a confession: I just nipped out for a comfort break. While I was away, Justin Rose set himself up nicely for a birdie at five, which would take him to three under. Misfortune for Mickelson though, who has gone out of bounds by the looks of things a hole ahead. The ball is missing and he'll take a drop. Fowler misses from eight feet again to get his fifth par on the spin. 1558 Mickelson and Stenson both nail their birdie putts. 1554 Matt Kuchar has a go from a good 30 yards, up and over a ridge and down to within six feet. That was for eagle, and he'll need to make the putt to get back even. He appears to have dropped a shot off-camera somewhere. Speaking of eagle putts, neither Mickelson nor Stenson can make theirs. The former was awful, spanking it miles past. Zach Johnson has a birdie putt at 11 and, though his line is good, it's undercooked from 15 feet. Shame for him, as that was for a share of the lead with his namesake Dustin. Kuchar makes the birdie. 1551 Stenson has bettered Mickelson and left himself a 10-footer for eagle. Speaking of eagle, that's what Danny Willett has just made with a monster putt on the 10th to go to five under, albeit before the tricky stuff begins. Speaking of the tricky stuff, Paul Kinnear has made +3 for the back nine and is now just two under. 1547 With the wind behind him, Mickelson hits a long drive off the tee on the par-five fifth. The second shot is tricky, because the flag is at the front of the green the wind is taking shots a way past it. Still, it's a decent enough shot into the middle and should be an easy two-putt for birdie. 1545 Rose drains a beauty from distance at four to pick up his second birdie. The lack of bogies on his card means that his score is therefore -2. Fowler has a similar effort, from a touch closer, but whaddya know, it's a touch short again . Faldo has a simple putt for par from five feet, but misses it left and he's two over through four. 1542 It looks as though Zach Johnson has picked up another shot to move to within one of the lead. The BBC didn't show it though. Speaking of people on -6, Jason Day is talking and says that it was easier for players who went out early as they didn't have to cope with the wind. \"I played very nicely,\" his says, not unreasonably. Speaking about his vertigo, Day says: \"It's past me now, I feel confident.\" 1539 On the 18th, Howell has a long long putt for birdie. It breaks faster than he expected though and goes off to the right, leaving him a tricky uphill effort from six feet to save par and stay on -4. He keeps his nerve and lands it. 1533 Back-to-back birdies for the 1995 champ, John Daly, who is -4 and dressed like the lower half of his body is a Christmas present. Never mind that though as Mickelson has just played a hell of a fourth: a brilliant long tee shot, but then he overcooked the second and the pall skipped 15ft or so past the hole. Not to worry, as Phil reads the small left-to-right break perfectly to make birdie. Stenson was in the bunker, but recovered well to save par. 1526 Rickie Fowle r's second shot to three is a touch short. The result is another 10ft putt for birdie and he again leaves it just short. Faldo goes wide, looking to reclaim the shot he dropped on the first, as the ball fails to break as he thought it might. \"Who will ever forget 1990?\" asks the TV commentator. Jordan Spieth wasn't even born then, you know. 1524 Zach Johnson has had a marvellous front nine and with a birdie right before the turn, joins that jam-packed cluster of players on five under. Just one behind are the veterans Bernhard Langer and David Howell . 1520 Kinnear got out of the bunker, but left himself a good 35ft short of the hole. His putt, all told, it's a great effort that stops six inches or so away. &lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Kelly Tilghman - Tiger Woods uses words like \"discouraging\" and \"anger\" to describe his emotions today.&lt;/noframe&gt; 1517 Sam Gallacher has birdied fifth to go to -3. It seems that play is a lot easier before the turn, with most birdies coming on the front nine (I've got nothing to back this up, but that's how it seems to me). Speaking to the telly, Spieth warns that tomorrow will be like playing a different course if the wind changes. 1512 Rose and Fowler both have putts for birdies on the second, but both leave it just short. Bad news for Paul Kinnear too, who has just trickled into the roadhole. 1509 Words from Dustin Johnson ! He says that conditions were very difficult on the back nine and he's pleased with his round. \"At Chambers I played very well,\" he says when asked if he's put his previous disappointment in majors behind him. \"It just wasn't my time.\" Dustin sits here. 1507 Magnificent from Daly, sending a long, 40-foot bumpy one straight down the green's gullett for birdie. 1505 Big Phil holds his nerve with one of those awkward six-foot putts to register a birdie at two, but then splunks his drive into the rough on three. It could be worse as he's just avoided a gully full of thickets of grass. Stenson's effort is better, smack bang in the middle of the fairway. &lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: John McEnerney - &lt;a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/DanLucas86\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;@DanLucas86&lt;/a&gt; might be a winner from this group of Phil, Big Henrik &amp;amp; Matt K. My new twins are hearing about Seve dropping that putt in 84!&lt;/noframe&gt; 1500 At the 18th, Jason Day completes a fine round with a par to finish with 66 - six birdies and nowt over - before Louis Oosthuizen betters him for the hole, but one behind for the day. Tiger misses a 20-yarder for birdie, but makes par. A decent enough back nine should have given him his confidence back. Justin Rose has picked up a shot at the first. 1456 Speaking of former All Blacks, I think I've just spotted Buck Shelford among the observers. You get a higher class of celebrity here than at Wimbledon. Fun fact: I went to school with his kids. It's amazing he had kids . 1454 &lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Phil J Patterson - &lt;a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/DanLucas86\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;@DanLucas86&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/TelegraphSport\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;@TelegraphSport&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/jj_bull\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;@jj_bull&lt;/a&gt; enjoying your work as always dan. Keep an eye on bowditch for me, he was 500/1&lt;/noframe&gt; Aw that's very kind of you. Steven Bowditch is a very respectable -3 through nine, although the TV people do seem to be ignoring him a touch. Among the underdogs, Paul Kinnear is having a cracker, sinking a simple putt at 15 to remain -5. 1451 They say two thousand zero zero party over it's out of time. So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999. Unlike Paul Lawrie, who is a foot or so away from making a hard breaking 30-yard putt, has to settle for par on the 18th and is therefore a shot off the lead in the clubhouse. 1446 Erm, I just wrote an entry that someone appears to have got rid of. It was telling you about a risky approach shot to the first green that Kuchar pulled off. Rose, Fowler and Faldo are underway as well. Meanwhile, Tom Watson has something to say after shooting 76: \"I stunk up the joint today the way I played,\" said the former Ryder Cup captain, who announced on Wednesday that next year's Masters will also be his last. \"Too many sixes on the back nine ruined my day. \"I had a little string of birdies going but made some unforced errors coming in... a little bit of brilliance but a bit of ugliness averaged it out. \"When I got it to a couple under par I knew the back nine was going to play a little tougher into the wind and I knew I had to hit some quality shots, and I didn't. That was the disappointment. I didn't follow up some of the good shots I hit in the middle of the round and finish the deal. I failed.\" Watson was grateful for the \"extremely nice\" support he received from the crowd, although he was not so enamoured by fans who wore masks bearing his likeness. \"Those are ugly masks,\" Watson joked. \"I told them there are way too many wrinkles in those masks. It kind of scared me looking at those, like geez, look at those things; that guy is ugly.\" 1440 JJ promised you facts from me eariler. Well the first one, courtesy of my dad, is that Ryan Fox, who currently sits three under, is the son of former All Black fly-half Grant Fox. His dad used to caddy for him. Also Justin Rose, who tied for fourth here as an amateur in 1998, has never bettered that finish. Bloody hell, 1998. 1438 Henrik Stenson gets his 2015 Open underway with a drive down the middle of the fairway. He's joined on the tee by Matt Kuchar , who is greeted with cries of \"Kooooch\". It sounds like booing, which makes him golf's equivalent to Joe Root, former Northampton Saints prop Brian Mujati and Mr. Boo-urns. 1435 Spieth birdies the 18th to finish with a very neat 67. He finishes it with a beauty of a putt too, the ball breaking a fair way left to right over a short-ish distance and trickling in. Matsuyama misses his birdie putt by a fair ol' way, then Johnson misses a similar one to Spieth, dropping short by a couple of inches. He finishes seven under for the day and sits pretty atop the leaderboard. 1431 Matsuyama, level par for the day, chips nicely on at the 18th to leave himself a 10-footer or so as it doesn't roll back down the hill a huge amount. He's had a shocker with the putter today though, so he shouldn't get his hopes up. Speaking of shockers: &lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Ian Poulter - Beyond disappointing to play well today &amp;amp; not hole putts that you expect to. Difficult game when the longest putt holed was 6ft &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&amp;q=%23Gutted\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;#Gutted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noframe&gt; Also Lawrie has missed a long putt for par at 17 and thus will shortly relinquish his lead. 1427 Afternoon folks. JJ Bull is gone and I, Dan Lucas, am your glorious new leader through to the close today. Do not email him, email me, for I hold the power now. Also holding the power is Tiger Woods. Kinda. After being +5 through 10, he has recovered somewhat to pull a shot back, making him +4 through 16. 1425 And as Jordan Spieth hands his putter over to his caddy, looking dejected at having landed in a bunker on the 17th hole, I shall hand over the keys to this liveblog to Dan Lucas, who has a very exciting fact about Justin Rose and some sort of rugby player he wants to share with you. Enjoy the rest of the day, thanks for reading and feel free to send me emails to joseph.bull@telegraph.co.uk which I can deal with when I return for the blog tomorrow. Happy golfing! 1420 Lee Westwood finishes his round with three bogies in a row, registering a final score of one under. Should have been better. Oh Lee. When will you learn? 1415 Something I missed earlier was when a child caused a half an hour delay by picking up JB Holmes' ball on the 15th. Holmes' playing partners played through while the American waited for a ruling on where the ball should be dropped was made. 1410 Miguel Angel Jimenez hits a shot so well from distance that it lands in the hole and is greeted with a lot of spontaneous applause. He celebrates by putting his sword (golf club) back in its sheath (his hand). 1405 Lawrie two-putts for four (par) on the 15th. 1403 Perhaps my favourite thing about this golf tournament that's happening right now, apart from my mate Paul Lawrie doing so well, is that two amateurs are in the top ten: 1400 Tom Watson says \"some unforced errors\" ruined his day, with the three sixes he scored on the back 9 of his final Open appearance weighing heavily on his mind. He looks nice though so in a way, he is the real winner. Except in another way he's not because he finished four over. 1355 Jordan Spieth also misjudges the green and misses out on a birdie 1355 The scores as they stand: Dustin Johnson has just dropped a putt dangerously short of the pin. There is work to do to save par 1352 Paul Lawrie overhits a chip and sends the ball flying over the top of the pin on the 15th hole, but recovers to make par. Still co-leading 1350 Paul Kinnear , an amateur on -6, is about an inch away from putting a superb birdie. Tiger Woods, a seasoned pro, has spent the last five years of his career pulling them. That's the last of my Tiger Woods relationship jokes I'll do. That one's not even very good, sorry. 1345 In the last ten minutes Peter Alliss has talked a bit about mechanical diggers and how much he hates helicopters. Tiger Woods has hit a birdie though! Is his luck about to turn? 1340 Spieth is trying to close the gap on the mighty Paul Lawrie at the top and takes an age to read the green on the 15th. His putt rolls up the hill and round the bend but just short of falling in the hole. Had it gone in, he would have scored a goal. Better luck next time, Jordan! 1338 *Beer bottle smash noise* *rock music starts playing* Just arrived at the course... #TheOpen #standrews #Team 1335 Just received this from The Telegraph's Luke Brown , who is in the mixed zone at The Open: England’s Greg Owen was briefly sitting pretty at the top of the leaderboard, after finishing his round with a score of 68, three under par. The 43 year old from Mansfield might not be one of Britain’s most recognizable golfers, but after beginning his round with a birdie, he looked in very good form, making a further four birdies and hitting an impressive 81% of the fairways around the Old Course. Despite this, it's probably safe not to expect Greg to be in contention for the Sports Personality of the Year award anytime soon, as he didn’t really expand on his understandable claim of “being happy”. “I’m really happy and I played really nice,” Owen said in a brief greenside interview, before adding- importantly- “It’s nice and solid, because with the calmer conditions and softer greens it’s not going to get easier than that. So I am really happy”. And there was me thinking Michael was the least insightful Owen in town. Still, we’re duty bound to support Greg, as a quick glance at Wikipedia tells me that his first ever win on tour was at the 2003 Daily Telegraph Damovo British Masters event. Altogether now: ‘he’s one of our own…’ 1330 Here he is. Sir Nick Faldo gets ready to launch some balls into the sky and on to a bit of grass quite far away from where he's standing for the last time in an Open. Faldo is asked by a BBC journalist: \"Why are you making your last appearance here at the Open? Is it because it's the home of golf?\" Faldo: \"No, it's because I'm old\" 1320 Paul Lawrie has just pulled another rabbit out of his hat. Having landed in the sand with one of his efforts, the Scot launches a shot that almost lands in the hole to save par. Alliss suggests it may be the \"shot of the year\" but then remembers that the BBC cameras didn't actually show the shot to the point where I have no idea whether it was from the bunker or not. It was really far out though, so let's just continue to assume it was that good, sort of like how Pele maintains the best goal ever scored was one that he got that nobody else remembers or saw. Pele knows though. 1316 Tom Watson , playing his last ever Open, reached the turn in 35 and got himself a birdie on the 10th. Since that point he's scored three sixes. 1309 Jordan Spieth 's 4th shot on the 14th hole is a delicate chip which runs past the pin and nestles on the bank of ground directly behind it. It threatens to roll backwards closer to the hole but he must now sink that to make par and stay at -5... He does. And the crowd goes moderately wild. About as wild as 50 people on a golf course could go. 1307 There should be some sort of graphic that tells you what hole they're on all of the time. Like how the score is always on screen in football or rugby. Or any other sport. I don't know why I'm telling you this, but just let it be known that when it happens, it was my idea. 1305 I know what you're thinking though - where's Charles Schwartzel? Let me tell you! He's almost making the shot of the day so far with an uphill putt from distance that j st misses the lip of the hole, on one of the holes. And genuinely that is all I know about Charles Schwartzel right now. Oh and he's -6. 1300 Meanwhile, my best friend ever, Paul Lawrie has just moved to -7 with a brilliant down hill putt. And look at the delight on his face: He looks like me when I'm about to break up with someone. 1254 Ivor Robson makes one of his last calls of the day, and of a 41 year career. \"On the tee from Spain, Miguel Jimenez\" *applause* *shot* \"On the tee from USA, John Daly... *looks up* WHAT THE FU 1250 Tiger Woods. Please. Please somebody make him stop. If he doesn't break down in tears at some point I think I might, and I don't even like golf. Peter Alliss sums up everyone's thoughts as Tiger underhits another shot by about 15 yards by saying \"ohyoyoyoyoyoyo... it's horrible to watch\". He is absolutely correct. 1242 Meanwhile, on Twitter, a row over whether Tiger Woods is finished or not continues... @Pigamingi1 @TelegraphSport @jj_bull he's finished mate never be the same again IMO so with that in mind he's finished sad but true. — Paul Dyer (@mabbutt) July 16, 2015 What do you think? 1240 Retief Goosen finishes both the front and back nine with 33, joining a bunch of people on the course on -6, including Paul Lawrie who just this second putted a birdie. 1234 Ian Poulter has a chance to get back to even with a long putt for birdie but drags it just left of the hole. 1230 Tiger Woods (in last place) hits his tee shot about five yards short of the green on 11, dangerously close to rolling backwards into the foot of a small mound, or hill. Whatever you want to call it, he doesn't want to be there. It's a par three and he should make it... but... you know. 1223 How is Tiger Woods playing so badly? It beggars belief that he can barely swing a club now, after the heights he's hit in the past. — Luke Aaron Moore (@lukeymoore) July 16, 2015 1220 The SMC Crew (c) are now on to the 12th hole. Most players try to drive between the gorse bushes on the left and a bunker just short of the green and Spieth does just that, landing beside a bunker. \"Not as easy as it looks!\" suggests our commentary team. Dustin Johnson powers his shot fairly close to the green. At the moment I have no idea where Matsuyama is because the BBC have forgotten about him. But not me. I still love you Matsuyama. *checks spelling of name*. The Japanese golf hero is currently three under. 1215 This caddy hides the hole that Jordan Spieth is putting in to, but we know he sinks it for birdie because the crowd makes a cheering noise. Spieth is now -6. 1212 Robert Streb explains his 66 in a post-round interview by saying he was \"just taking advantage of the holes\". Speaking of taking advantage of holes, Tiger Woods reaches the turn in 40 shots, four over. Sad face. 1210 Here's a nice colourful version of the scores so far 1205 My pal Paul Lawrie is having a superb game so far, sinking a 25 foot putt on the ninth hole to reach the turn in 31 strokes. That means he is now five under, in case you weren't sure. 1202 Meanwhile, Dustin Johnson moves to six under with a birdie and joins Robert Streb at the top, with Strebb finishing his round with 66. 1200 This is that tenth hole that Speith is annoyed to have scored a par on. The second shot was the one that had him up and talking, but the American is still five under. 1158 Jordan Spieth falls just short of having a mild Happy Gilmore meltdown by yelling \"Sit down, ball. Sit down!\" (don't you want to go to your home?!) on the tenth. It sort of does sit down but I guess Spieth just has higher standards than most of us. @jj_bull Spieth will use his ability to hit the ball straight as an arrow, The bunkers will give him fits keeping him going real low. — Dallas Besty (@dallasbesty) July 16, 2015 1156 Paul Lawrie is though. He ends his first nine five under after a birdie on the ninth hole 1154 Woods really isn't having fun today. @TelegraphSport @jj_bull sadly for him and the sport he's finished, IMO will never see one man dominate a sport like him, sad ending. — Paul Dyer (@mabbutt) July 16, 2015 1152 David Lingmerth ends his round with a birdie on the 18th, finishing three under on 69. To use a cliche from a sport I am more familiar with, his really was a game of two halves: 1148 Ivor Robson is announcing the players at the first tee for the last time this Open, ending a 41 year career. Last year ESPN got some players to impersonate that familiar voice... 1146 Dustin Johnson moves to five under after hitting par from a short range putt on the ninth hole and is joined by Jordan Spieth who does exactly the same. 1137 Jordan Spieth is making it look really easy to be absolutely brilliant, and seems genuinely annoyed when he putts for par on the 8th. 1134 Paul Lawrie , the unexpected Open champion at Carnoustie in 1999, is currently three under after six holes. I particularly like Lawrie because he used to be the pro at my local golf course and so through some nonsensical local pride I wish him well. Judging by how badly my football teams usually do, this is bad news for Paul. 1132 If you haven't been to St Andrews before, it is genuinely beautiful. Some of the cutaway shots the BBC go to are lovely to look at. 1129 And Tiger Woods misses his tricky birdie opportunity but sinks the follow up for par. It says something about him that even the gimme shots don't seem like gimmes. 1127 Remember Paul Dunne ? My favourite player? Well the Irish amatuer has just finished his round with a 69, finishing three under. 1125 Jordan Spieth moves to -5 after seven and now that I've slagged off Tiger Woods he's got his first birdie opportunity of the day. This is why you should always be nice to people 1120 From the BBC: \"Tiger Woods only stays at room 269 at the Old Course Hotel because this was the score that he posted when he won the Open at St Andrews in 2000.\" Judging by how today is doing and based on his performance so far, next year he's going to be staying in one of the farm sheds just slightly down the road from the course. 1119 I have to say, having this blue line thing coming out of the ball when its been hit has made watching golf almost enjoyable for me. Actually knowing where the hell the ball is rather than knowing it is \"somewhere in the sky\" makes the game a lot easier to follow. 1116 Rather than show live golf, the BBC have Dan Walker interviewing an ex Welsh international rugby player. What a farce. — Ewan Murray (@mrewanmurray) July 16, 2015 1115 Game number 26 begins as a name Peter Alliss isn't familiar with takes to the tee. Jonathan Moore powers his drive onto the fairway and is followed by Scott Hend and Ryan Fox, who do exactly the same. Because they are all golfers and this is easy to them. 1110 Robert Streb has taken the lead with -6 after 15. David Lingmerth moves down to joint fourth position after not taking the back nine as well as he might have hoped, or expected, after a superb front nine. 1105 The ghost of Tiger Woods is still on the course, exploring various bits of it that he probably didn't think he'd get to see before he started playing. His third shot on the fifth hole is from deep in the rough, after a second which he took leaning down a hill. The chip lands on the green and keeps on rolling. Away from the hole. 1103 Jordan Spieth is playing well, chips the ball onto the green right next to the pin but with a bit too much back spin and it rolls a few feet away. He should putt the next shot easily 1100 1057 Dustin Johnson is annoyed with his tee shot on the sixth, hitting it slightly left and on to what looks like rough, but is really just slightly longer grass. Spieth and Matsuyama drive directly down the middle. 1054 American amatuer Oliver Schniederjans, who looks like he plays golf after his job at Abercrombie and Fitch, made one of the putts of the day so far earlier on, dropping a huge shot on the eighth green. He is -3 after ten holes, putting him ahead of some big names - former Open champions Ernie Els for one. Oh and Tiger Woods... 1047 Dustin Johnson putts for an eagle on the par 5 fifth hole - his second shot flew way high up in the air and dropped next to the pin. Spieth makes birdie and is still -2 1045 It would be lovely to hear from some of you reading this or watching the action along with me. What has become of Tiger Woods? Will Dustin Johnson blame the greens today? Is Spieth definitely going to win this? Email me at joseph.bull@telegraph.co.uk or tweet me, if you prefer @jj_bull 1040 The weather has become far more cold-looking, the clear skies replaced by clouds of impending doom. Welcome to summer in Scotland, everyone. 1037 Peter Alliss just told a seagull to \"shut up\" 1035 David Lingmerth has discovered that he doesn't like the back nine as much as he likes the first and has stopped scoring birdies on every single hole. Very rarely, like right now, he doesn't even get par. The Swede puts a short put just wide of the hole to move to -5. He's still the leader though so it's not all bad. 1034 Tiger Woods is the first player today to open the round bogey-bogey — Chris Fallica (@chrisfallica) July 16, 2015 1031 Jordan Spieth seems to also have played the same hole for a par and does so. The SMJ Crew will head towards the fifth hole now, which looks like this: 1029 Dustin Johnson, who so narrowly missed out on the US Open on the final hole in June, sinks his putt for par. 1027 All three players in the Spieth, Matsuyama, Johnson Crew, which I shall now call the SMJ Crew for short, are two under as they approach the pin on the fourth 1025 Perhaps Mr Woods should read our article on how to play at St Andrews and Kingsbarn. Because right now his sad looking face is making me feel sad. 1023 Tiger Woods is so, so, so close to recording a par on the second hole. It's a fairly difficult shot, although according to a lot of people the greens are in superb, slow condition today, but Woods fires it with perfect direction. The ball rolls all the way around the rim, completing a 270degree spin and lands next to the hole. Two bogies in a row (shocked cat emoji). 1018 David Lingmerth is still six under after putting for par on the 12th hole. 1015 Tiger Woods makes \"a huge misjudgement\" and lands about 40 or 50 yards short of the green on his second shot on hole number two. This could be a really long day for the former champion. Unless he does what I do in that sort of situation and just walks off the course to hit the bar instead. Everyone loves you in the bar. 1012 Jordan Spieth almost adds his name to that leaderboard but narrowly misses a putt for birdie on the second hole. 1010 Here's an update on the scores so far: 1007 Tiger Woods completes his disappointing start to the round by putting for a bogie on the first hole. 1005 Darren Clarke putts for a birdie on the third hole and is now two under. The BBC commentary team are obsessed with his beard for some reason. 1000 Oh there he is. Tiger lands his second shot directly inside the Swilcan Burn . 0956 Here he comes: Tiger Woods . A player who has fallen so far down the world rankings that he doesn't even appear in the new EA Sports PGA Tour video game. That is the same video game which he used to be the cover star of until 2014... Tiger recieves a very warm reception from the crowd around the first tee and whacks the ball straight down the fairway. 0955 Spieth is receiving some words of wisdom from his caddy and hits an excellent chip on to the 2nd green. He now has the kind of putt that someone who isn't very good at golf would miss... 0947 On the second hole Matsuyama lands his tee shot almost exactly on top of Jordan Spieth's, which according to my knowledge of golf, means that they now have to fight to the death in the middle of the fairway to decide which gets to keep playing. So sad. 0945 Just as I predicted, all three of Spieth , Matsuyama and Johnson putt for birdie on the first hole. 0943 Early leader David Lingmerth has scored his first bogey of the day and drops to -6 0940 Spieth chips onto the green and looks set to record a birdie on the first hole. Unless something goes wrong that is, which can happen in golf. A lot. Dustin Johnson hits the best second shot of the three (Matsuyama the third) and has the ball ever so slightly closer to the pin. Birdies all round, you'd expect. 0938 Here come the clouds... 0937 David Lingmerth has gone completely off form on the tenth hole, finishing with a measly par. 0936 Still no sign of Happy Gilmore. 0934 And we're off! Spieth fires the ball down the left of the fairway and is followed by Japan's Hideki Matsuyama and fellow countryman Dustin Johnson . 0933 Here he comes! The favourite (since Rory McIllroy's ankle came off), Jordan Spieth is only 21 and has an historic chance to win the third major of a golf grand slam. \"The hardest part is jetlag\" said the Texan in his pre-Open press conference, referring to his decision to play in a tournament in America last week. Let's see how he gets on. 0930 Lingmerth has hit a slightly wayward tee shot on the tenth hole but recovers well on his second. The Swede is seven under and two clear at the top of the leaderboard. Here's what the tenth hole would look like if it were drawn by someone: 0925 Westwood putts for birdie on the first hole to cheers from the gathered crowd. Reed just sort of wandered off in disgust after his last shot. I know how you feel, Patrick. But really. I really know how it feels to have a bad game of golf 0920 \"Only another 71 holes to go\" says the BBC commentary team as Westwood and Garcia's playing partner Patrick Reed finishes on a six after chipping a ball straight into the burn. Bad start for the American. 0918 Ahead of Jordan Spieth's first shot of the day, how does the 21 year old compare to some of the other (previously) young champions of the game? Interactive: Jordan Spieth 0912 Lee Westwood and Sergio Garcia have teed off the first now. Here are the current scores: 0910 Ian Poulter steps up to the tee and is greeted by Ivor Robson , as famous as any of the golfers taking part in today's round of golf. 0905 And another one. Lingmerth moves to -6 after another birdie on the seventh hole. The favourite, Jordan Spieth, tees off at 9:33 and has some work to do 0855 ANOTHER birdie for David Lingmerth who is now -5 and back at the top of the leaderboard. He's on fire 0850 Here's Ernie Els of South Africa's tee shot from the first hole 0845 The weather in St Andrews is absolutely ideal for the early starters, with clear skies at present. Anyone who has spent their entire life in Scotland like I have will realise that this can only be temporary... so let's see what the Met Office thinks is going to happen for the next few days in St Andrews: I can confirm that yes, it is indeed possible for it to be raining, dark and sunny all at the same time. 0840 Tom Watson , one of the greatest golf champions of all, has teed off along with playing partners Ernie Els and Brandt Snedeker . This is Watson's last ever Open as the 65 year old looks to wind down his career. Former Open champion Tony Jacklin told today's Metro: \"I'm not envious of anybody but god I wish I could still putt like Tom\" 0832 Meanwhile, Thomas Bjorn (Denmark) scored three consecutive birdies on the fourth, fifth and sixth holes and another on the eighth to tie level at -4 with Lingmerth at the top of the table. 0828 Justin Rose has picked up his pin-position card too. Does \"interesting\" mean good? If I go on a date with someone and she says my clothes are \"interesting\", I don't take that as a compliment. Some really interesting pins for Round One. #TheOpen #Team Then again, some people just don't appreciate boiler suits as much as I do. 0825 Every golfer's secret weapon: diagrams of melting tadpoles where the pins are. The pin sheet for first round of @TheOpen #TheOpen pic.twitter.com/paqElqp8ez — GA @ The Open (@GolfAust) July 16, 2015 0820 David Lingmerth 4 under through 4 holes. The last person to start a round of golf this well was Kim Jong-il. #TheOpen — Richard Osman (@richardosman) July 16, 2015 0817 David Lingmerth has clearly had his wheat based breakfast food this morning. He putts another birdie (that's four in four) to stay top of the leaders board at -4. I've already completely forgotten about Paul Dunne. 0815 This is a nice little picture of the very first hole on the St Andrews course 0810 Harry Redknapp is a man who likes golf and has had his say on who he thinks might win this tournament. I watched Jordan Spieth win again on Sunday, he’s an absolute (sic) fantastic young player and a worthy favourite Here's the ex-football manager getting annoyed when someone hits him with a golf ball 0800 Lee Westwood has suggested that the holes need to be bigger and courses made easier for golf to capture a new audience to prevent a continuing fall in participators. He reckons the authorities also need to do more to encourage women to play and remove the stigma that the sport is an old \"toff's\" game. But what do you think? Sports cars instead of golf buggies? Multi-ball? Wild, roaming lions on the course? Or is golf actually alright just the way it is? Tell me, tell me, tell me: joseph.bull@telegraph.co.uk 0757 Here's Lingmerth teeing off at the 2nd from earlier this morning 0754 David Lingmerth is playing in his very first Open today and has made an absolute dream start, with birdies on all of his first three holes. The 27 year old actually lost his USPGA Tour card last year. Great start for the Swede 0751 Here's the leaderboard at the moment: 0747 Who do you think will win the prestigious Claret Jug this year? Jordan Spieth? Paul Dunne? Nick Faldo? Feel free to let me know by sending a delicious email to joseph.bull@telegraph.co.uk so we can be friends 0743 At the moment Irish amateur Paul Dunne is leading the The Open with a -2. I'll be cheering for him for a while now 0738 Hello there! JJ Bull checking in to take you through a lot of today's action at St Andrews. Australia's Rod Pampling was the man to hit the first golf ball of the day, teeing off at 6:34am along with playing partner Greg Owen, though not at exactly the same time as that could cause complications. Thomas Bjorn followed suit and The Open 2015 was underway. What joy! 0630 Jordan Spieth is fully aware of the magnitude of what he is trying to achieve by winning the 144th Open Championship at St Andrews. But if the 21-year-old was feeling the pressure of trying to remain on course for an unprecedented calendar grand slam, he did a brilliant job of hiding it. \"I like to study the history of golf and I think it's extremely special what this year has brought,\" the Masters and US Open champion said on Wednesday. \"I'm sure embracing that opportunity, but by the time I start on Thursday, it won't be in my head. It'll be about how can I bring this Open Championship down to just another event, get out there and try and get myself into contention. \"It would be amazing (to win). It would be something I'd never forget. I don't think there's anything more special in golf than playing an Open Championship at the Home of Golf. I think here and Augusta National are my two favourite places in the world. It would mean the world to me to try and win this championship and to do it here would be even more special.\" Jordan Spieth in front of the famous St Andrews clubhouse Just two men have won three major championships in the same year, with Ben Hogan winning all three he played in 1953 only to be denied the chance of a grand slam due to a clash of dates. Hogan won the Masters by five shots and the US Open by six, but with the US PGA Championship - then still a match play event - not finishing until July 7 in Michigan and the Open starting a day later, he opted to travel to Carnoustie and secured his only Open title by four shots. In 2000, Tiger Woods won the US Open, Open Championship and US PGA before completing the 'Tiger Slam' in 2001 with victory in the Masters. \"I think I can certainly draw on the first two majors,\" added Spieth, the second youngest Masters champion ever behind Woods. \"But I'm not putting on added pressure to try and win three in a row. I don't think of those other two majors as being in a row this year, I just think of them as tournaments that I've won that are of the same calibre. \"I look at this as trying to win The Open Championship at a very special place. The hardest thing for me is trying to forget about where you are because being here at St Andrews and looking at the past champions, that's elite company.\" It was only two years ago that Spieth played his first Open at Muirfield having secured his place in the field four days earlier by becoming the first teenage winner on the PGA Tour since 1931. And approaching the end of his second round he was tied for the lead at three under par, before dropping four shots in his last four holes. \"I remember almost thinking like that was too big for me at the time,\" Spieth added. \"I felt like I wanted to compete, I loved the pressure and I felt like I could do it, but it was a position I'd never been in and it was an odd feeling being in contention in a major. \"But sitting here today, that's where I expect myself to be. I don't think I could have imagined sitting here this soon. I certainly wanted to at some point, but it's pretty cool to be here this early and to have the opportunities we have going forward.\" Tee times 0632 Thomas Bjorn (Den), Greg Owen, Rod Pampling (Aus) 0643 Todd Hamilton (USA), (x) Paul Dunne, James Hahn (USA) 0654 Graham Delaet (Can), Brian Harman (USA), Russell Knox 0705 Alexander Levy (Fra), Matt Every (USA), David Lingmerth (Swe) 0716 Robert Streb (USA), Joost Luiten (Ned), Matt Jones (Aus) 0727 (x) Jordan Niebrugge (USA), Anthony Wall, Byeong-Hun An (Kor) 0738 Sandy Lyle, Charley Hoffman (USA), Kevin Na (USA) 0749 Shane Lowry, Retief Goosen (Rsa), Kevin Streelman (USA) 0800 Luke Donald, Hunter Mahan (USA), Carl Pettersson (Swe) 0811 Billy Horschel (USA), Victor Dubuisson (Fra), Ross Fisher 0822 (x) Oliver Schniederjans (USA), Webb Simpson (USA), Graeme McDowell 0833 Ernie Els (Rsa), Brandt Snedeker (USA), Tom Watson (USA) 0844 J.B.
