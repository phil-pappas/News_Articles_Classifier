Southwest later fired the captain.\nThe safety board said that the late change in control left both pilots unable to monitor the plane's altitude. Instead, the board said, the captain should have ordered a so-called go-around â€” call off the landing, circle and try again.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T01:48:55.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
