We tell you how. \nHave oily skin, and are sick of acne and blackheads? Then, open skin pores are what you must tackle right away. The ­constant oozing of oil and clogged pores lead to loss of elasticity of the pores, in turn, enlarging them. This further makes the texture of the skin thick and coarse. Here are a few easy remedies to combat the excess oil and fix open pores: \n1 Ice Cubes \nIce has a skin-tightening effect, which helps minimise enlarged pores and also stimulate blood circulation. \nMethod: After cleansing the face, wrap ice cubes in a clean cloth and apply it on the areas with open pores for a few ­seconds at a time. \n2 Tomato Juice \nKnown to remove oil, tomato juice has an astringent effect. It cleanses and shrinks the pores. \nMethod: Tomato juice or pulp may be applied by itself, or it may be mixed with cucumber juice and egg white. This would have a powerful ­cleansing effect. \n3 Egg Whites \nEgg whites contain enzymes that reduce oiliness, cleanse, tone and tighten the skin. \nMethod: Beat egg white and apply on the face, avoiding the lips. Wash it off when it dries. \n4 Fuller’s Earth \nFuller’s Earth (multani mitti) absorbs excess oil, tightens the pores, ­and cleanses the skin. It also reduces blemishes and scars and ­benefits sun-damaged skin. \nMethod: Mix Fuller’s Earth with rose water into a paste and apply on the face, avoiding the lips and area around eyes. Wash it off when it dries. \n5 Oatmeal \nThis natural remedy is great for exfoliating the skin and hence removing excess oil and dead skin cells that make open pores appear larger. It soothes the skin and can be used for sensitive skin as well. \nMethod: Mix oatmeal with egg white and apply on the areas with open pores. When it dries, moisten it and rub gently on the skin. Wash off with plenty of water. \n6 Yoghurt \nYoghurt contains lactic acid that helps restore the ­normal pH balance of the skin. This removes dead cells and keeps the pores free of hardened oil. It also brightens the skin. \nMethod: Mix it with ground almonds, powdered and dried orange and lemon peels. Apply on the face and rub gently on the skin in circular movements, especially on areas with open pores. Wash off with water. \n7 Lemon Juice \nLemon juice contains citric acid that ­exfoliates skin and minimises the appearance of open pores. Astringents in it help close the pores. Rose water is also a natural skin toner. \nMethod: Mix rose water and lemon juice in equal parts and apply on the face. Wash off with water after 10 minutes. \nWith Inputs by Shahnaz Husain.
