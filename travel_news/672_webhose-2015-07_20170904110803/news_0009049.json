And he's counting on his own two feet to get him from point A to point B. \nTurcich arrived in the Mobile area on day 94 of his journey. \n\"Walking the world isn't for the faint of heart,\" Turcich said. \"When it's 100 degrees outside and you're hot - I sweated for 3 days - you can't have thoughts of turning back.\" \nFor Turcich, the walk around the world is who he is. It's his way to seize the day in memory of two friends he lost. \nTurcich has done a lot of planning, and offers a bit of advice if you've ever plan to walk around the world. Don't do it on a whim Wear trail running shoes, because they're lighter Get a camel back, so you don't have to stop to drink water Get a big floppy hat to give you a little shade when there is none. Pack light. Turcich said he packed: 4 pairs of socks, 3 pairs of underwear, shortsleeve shirt, longsleeve shirt, down jacket, a hat Buy a washboard. A friend of Turcich's bought him a wash board with a carrying bag. Where he finds water, he can wash his clothes. \nTurcich started his journey on April 2, 2015 in his hometown of Haddon Township, New Jersey. He said it breaks down into four sections over about five years. \nThe first leg took him to Sandbridge Island, Virginia. He took a two week break to have Lasik surgery and for a friend's wedding. After his break, he picked right back up where he left off and is headed to Antartica. Once he steps foot in Antartica, he plans to fly home. Section three of his journey will take him from Portugal to Beijing, then the south coast of Australia. His final leg will be to cross the continental United States to his hometown. \nTurcich said he's looking forward to the countryside of Mexico, the tip of Argentina, and seeing family in Croatia. \nTurcich appreciates the kindness of people along the way to keep his journey going. In Mobile, Fleet Feet Sports Mobile owner Marjorie Rockwell has put him up for two nights as he works to get his phone fixed. \nTurcich's message is a simple one. \n\"Be alive.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T01:59:12.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
