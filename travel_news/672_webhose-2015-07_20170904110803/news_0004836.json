The centre’s focus on customer experience will see new static and digital signage systems installed to aid wayfinding and showcase event branding. New ceilings will team with new dimmable halo lighting, strip lighting and LED colour changing uplighters. Flagship room the Churchill will introduce an LED star cloth and ceiling mounted moving lights to add glamour and glitz to awards ceremonies, parties and other special events. \nThis new centre-wide lighting infrastructure will support the award-winning venue’s move to attract a broader range of event types. Greater breakout room capabilities will be created through reconfiguration of spaces on levels 2 and 3 of the centre, while more than 4,000 new, luxury Boss Design conference chairs and tables will refresh theatre style and classroom configurations, top tables and boardroom setups. The renovated front canopy, which occupies Broad Sanctuary, opposite Westminster Abbey, will be fully renovated and feature colour customisable pin spot lighting. This is in addition to the exterior colour washes already achievable, which can further enhance the arrival experience. The QEII Centre began a £12 million capital investment programme and rebranding 18 months ago, to re-establish its ‘wow’ factor and improve visitors’ experiences. Cutting-edge technology, luxury fixtures, discreet security and a QEII concierge service have combined to warm the welcome, while the remodelled foyer is now bright and spacious with airport-style check-in desks to aid concurrent registration for events. Mark Taylor, QEII Centre chief executive, said: “This phase of works continues with our multi-phased master programme that has already transformed the centre and had a significant impact upon our trading. The centre grew its occupancy level and turnover by 17.5% in 2014/15 recording its best income performance since 2008/09. What is particularly interesting to note is that while we have changed physically, we have also evolved philosophically too. We have invested and analysed our customer journey and our clients have remarked on the change – the team have all got a new spring in their step.” The centre is an increasingly successful profit making agency, paying an annual dividend to the Exchequer of £1.5 million in 2014/15, achieving target. This is forecast to increase to £1.7 million in 2015/16, and is projected to rise further over the centre’s corporate plan period. Summer refurbishment works at QEII Centre are due for completion in early September.
