The centerpiece of the Pierce-Arrow convention will take place on July 25 when a free collection of 75 of the famed cars will be on display along Seneca Street between Michigan Avenue and Chicago Street. Admission to the museum will still be charged. The July 25 event will run from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Pierce-Arrow collectors from California, New England and Florida will be showcasing their vehicles. Sandoro’s museum will have a dozen Pierce-Arrows on display. The convention will be based out of the Adam’s Mark Hotel. Next summer, Sandoro’s museum and the city will host the annual meeting of the National Mustang Club. Buffalo is likely to be the host city for 2018’s “Great Race” where classic and vintage automobiles recreate the early 1900s era race across America. Kevin Curtin , Pierce-Arrow meeting chairman, said because of the demographics within the classic and vintage car collectors world, Buffalo stands to see a large spin-off economic impact. “Buying a classic car, whether it is a Pierce-Arrow or a ‘65 Mustang, is not an inexpensive investment,” Curtin said. “For most of these people, this is their hobby. This is their country club membership.” Curtin estimates there are several thousand Pierce-Arrows still in existence. Not bad considering the car was last made in 1938, ending a run that began in 1901. Besides the Pierce-Arrow, other cars made in Buffalo included the Thomas Flyer and Playboy. But, the Pierce-Arrow is the most famous. Buffalo’s legacy, combined with Sandoro’s museum and the region’s rich architectural landscape, are coming to the forefront and helping to make the city a prime destination among car collectors. “We are building up that reputation as being a destination for car lovers,” Curtin said. \nWant Buffalo Travel news in your inbox?
