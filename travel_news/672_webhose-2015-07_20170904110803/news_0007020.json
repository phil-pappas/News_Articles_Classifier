Ottawa County is looking to a crowdfunding site to make up the last $60,000 of an effort to add a 4-foot bike shoulder to Lakeshore Drive. “To push this campaign over the top, we need supporters to pitch-in at every level\", said County Commissioner and Chairman of the Planning Commission Greg DeJong. \"This means we need contributors to donate at the $10,000 level, $5 level, and every level in between.\" The road commission doesn’t have the estimated $175,000 to extend a planned 3-foot shoulder an additional foot on either side of the 3.3 miles of road to be repaved this summer. So far, $119,000 has been raised from the Ottawa County Board of Commissioners, the Port Sheldon Township Board, the Ottawa County Parks and Recreation Commission, Herman Miller Cares, ODL Inc. of Zeeland, the Macatawa Area Cycling Club, and the Holland Convention and Visitors Bureau. “We have beat the odds in raising $119,000. I think we can beat the odds again by raising $60,000 more from the Community,” said Kerry Irons of Pedal Holland. The all-or-nothing campaign is at Patronicity.com/LakeshoreBikeLane or go to Patronicity.com and search for “Lakeshore Drive.” Donations in any amount — from $1 to $60,000 — are being accepted. If it succeeds, a 4-foot bike lane would be constructed this summer on Lakeshore Drive between Butternut Drive and New Holland Street. If the campaign fails to raise the remaining $60,000 by July 24, all donations must be returned. Lakeshore Drive between Robbins Road and Croswell Street in Grand Haven and Port Sheldon townships already has a 4-foot bike shoulder. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials recommend at least a 4-foot-wide shoulder for competitive, touring and commuter cycling, a growing area in West Michigan Tourism, according to county officials. The campaign includes rewards at every donation level. Donors of $1 or more will receive a thank you email from the county. Those who donate $100 or more will receive a personalized thank you note signed by DeJong. For a $500 donation, donors will receive a $5 gift card to Velo City Cycles; $1,000 donors will receive a free Ottawa County Parks permit for 2016; $2,500 donors will receive a $25 gift card to Boatwerks Waterfront Restaurant; $5,000 donors will receive two free passes to an exclusive cook-out and concert with Pedal Holland bicycle club; $10,000 donors will receive two free passes to the annual friends of Ottawa County Parks Grand River tour on the Grand Lady riverboat.
