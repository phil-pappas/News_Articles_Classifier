The police report references a “strong odor of intoxicants” coming out of Pappa’s vehicle and two open containers of alcohol in the right, rear passenger seat.\nPappa underwent a field sobriety test before being placed in custody at 8:28 a.m. and taken to a nearby State Patrol office to perform a blood-alcohol-content screening. He provided two breath samples, .174 and .166. The state limit is .08. He was released to a licensed driver after the testing was completed.\nPappa played the final 26 minutes of Seattle’s 1-0 loss to Colorado on Saturday night at CenturyLink Field, having just returned to the team following Guatemala’s early exit from the 2015 Gold Cup. The 27-year-old midfielder has no previous moving violations in Washington.\nMost Read Stories Video from bus driver’s body camera could cost 2 deputies their jobs Donnie Chin, Chinatown ID's 'frontline hero,' killed in early morning shooting Time for Mariners to face reality as trade deadline nears 2 killed in drive-by shooting on I-5 in Mount Vernon Lifestyle changes may guard aging brain against memory loss Pappa is ineligible to play until the completion of an MLS investigation and screening by the league’s substance-abuse doctors.\n“He’s a teammate, and we need to support him,” Seattle coach Sigi Schmid said Tuesday. “I think all of us, individually, have either known somebody or somebody that we were related to that went through something like this, or another difficult situation like this.\n“Right now he needs our support to come through this at the other end as a stronger person.”\nMatt Pentz : 206-464-3184 or mpentz@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @mattpentz .
