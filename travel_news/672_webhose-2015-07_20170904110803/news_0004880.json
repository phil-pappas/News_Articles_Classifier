Supplied \nPaul Lupi, known as PJ, picture before a scooter accident in Phuket put him in a coma. \n\"His kidney is stable and is repairing and functioning normally and his eye socket is not as bad as previously thought. He's still in a coma, but he's opening his eyes and his motor skills are improving,\" \n\"The doctors are really, really happy that he's making progress this quickly.\" \nPJ's business partner Harvey Frame said he was still asleep about 90 per cent of the time, but has made the first step towards waking up. He said PJ could be off his breathing ventilator in as soon as a week. \n\"Paul is breathing on his own 80 per cent of the time now but still requires to be ventilated. If he continues to recover as he is doing he will be off the ventilator within seven days and then cleared to come home. \nMeanwhile, PJ had a special visitor on Saturday night who dropped a collection of gifts for the Wellington man. One was a small stuffed penguin that the family had named Penelope, or Penny for short. \n\"It sits in PJ's arm to give him some female company,\" Joe said. \nAt the same time, PJ's friends in New Zealand were working on their own gift. Ad Feedback \n\"His mates are creating a video diary of all of this so he can see how much everyone has done and how much everyone loves him,\" Joe explained. \n\"He deserves it though, he's the most generous, happy guy. Every room he came in to he made everyone happy and laugh. \n\"Life to him was a fun thing, nothing to him was ever very serious. You miss that. But I know it's gonna come back with a vengeance,\" Joe said on Sunday. \nJust under a week ago, the New Zealand embassy in Thailand phoned PJ's family to tell them the 28-year-old had been in a serious scooter accident. \nPJ had insurance back home, but was not covered with travel insurance. \nFather Paul Lupi Sr, brother Mark Lupi, and friend Matt Hodgson found him in a cramped hospital room when they flew to his bedside in Phuket. \nHis family immediately put up $50,000 of their own money to have Lupi airlifted to Bangkok's Bumrungrad International Hospital to get specialist treatment. \nA fundraising page, which was set up by Lupi's friends and family on Wednesday to cover his care and his transport home, reached its $150,000 goal on Friday night with more than 1500 people donating money. \n\"It's unbelievable,\" Joe said. \"People have shown their generosity and we're extremely grateful.\" \nIt costs about $6000 a day to keep Paul in the hospital in Bangkok, plus more for scans and surgery and the cost to bring him home, his family said. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T10:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T02:10:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
