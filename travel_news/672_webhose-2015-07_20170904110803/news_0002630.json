The Coastal Fire Centre says that blaze has now destroyed an uninhabited cabin. \nBetween 2007 and 2013 the B.C. government had a contract with Coulson to use the lumbering planes to fight forest fires. \nThe four-engine plane has the largest capacity of any water bomber in the world at 27,000 litres. But in 2014 it was replaced with a contract for smaller, newer aircraft that were better able to navigate B.C.'s mountainous terrain. \nEarlier this year a plan to trade the aircraft with a museum was scuttled by Canada's heritage minister.
