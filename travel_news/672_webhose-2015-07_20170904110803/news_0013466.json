This will be our only comment on this private, family matter. Thank you for understanding.”\nThere appeared to be some clues in the lead up to the split, with some saying that the pair have been separated for six months.\nStrife ... Ben Affleck and actress Jennifer Garner say their marriage required a lot of patience. Picture: Getty Source: Getty Images\nIn 2013 when he accepted his Oscar for Argo, Affleck thanked Garner for “working” on their marriage.\n“It is work but it’s the best kind of work and there is nobody else I would rather do that kind of work with,” he said.\nHe told Details magazine a year earlier that his wife was “patient” with his workaholic tendencies.\n“I am not very present in the rest of my life,” he said. “My wife’s very patient. She does everything.\n“If I have time, I try to spend time with the kids, even if just to be a physical presence, the bath, whatever. But my mind’s always going, ‘How are we going to light that shot tomorrow?” he said.\nLoves a bet ... Ben Affleck is a poker fiend. Picture: Getty Source: Getty Images\nThen Garner told Yahoo! in May this year that perhaps Affleck wasn’t the kind of father she had envisaged when they married.\n“You just go on a ride together because you don’t know who you’re going to be when you first have a baby and you don’t know who [your partner] is going to be,” she said. “You have to just hang in there while you figure it out — and have a lot of patience for each other.”\nHowever reports of gambling and heavy drinking continue to plague Affleck.\nHe checked into rehab for alcohol addiction in 2001 after his first high-profile split from Gwyneth Paltrow.\nCo-stars ... Gwyneth Paltrow (l) with Ben Affleck in scene from film Bounce, which came out as the pair split up. Picture: Supplied Source: News Limited\nThe Shakespeare in Love star told Howard Stern in January this year that while she and Affleck remain good friends, he wasn’t the best boyfriend.\n“He was not in a good place in his life to have a girlfriend,” she said.\nThe pair dated from 1997 to 2000 after which Paltrow said that Affleck would be “better off dating a Scores stripper. Anyone that serves cold beer in a bikini.”\nComplicated ... Gwyneth Paltrow says she hopes Ben Affleck gets it together. Picture: Supplied Source: News Corp Australia\n“Ben makes life tough for himself,’ the star told Diane Sawyer in 2006. “He’s got a lot of complication, and you know, he really is a great guy. So I hope he sorts himself out.”\n“I just think we have a very different sort of value system,” she said.\nHis split from former fiance Jennifer Lopez was also tumultuous. They dated for 18 months between 2002 and 2004 and earned the moniker ‘Bennifer’. However they called off their wedding days before the ceremony and split a few months later.\nAlso co-stars ... Just like Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez split after starring together in box office bomb Gigli. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nLopez is on record saying that Affleck hated being in a relationship that was constant tabloid fodder.\nHowever it is believed that Affleck’s drinking and gambling also played a role in their demise.\n“I think Jen and I made a mistake in that we fell in love, we were excited and maybe too accessible. I don’t think either of us anticipated the degree to which it would take on a world of its own,” Affleck has said.\nStill friends ... Jennifer Lopez and former fiance Ben Affleck are friendly even after their split. Picture: Supplied Source: AFP\nGarner has also been unlucky in love. She was married to Felicity co-star Scott Foley from 2000-2003. It has been reported that Foley was unable to deal with her rising star.\n“Jennifer became a huge celebrity. She became a huge star, and she deserved everything she got. There was no other relationship, there was no infidelity, nothing. People get divorced, you know? Through no one’s fault and everyone’s fault,” he told TV Guide in 2003.\nRocketed to fame ... Jennifer Garner met first husband Scott Foley on the set of Felicity but her star started soaring after landing the lead role in Alias and her husband didn’t cope well with it. Picture: Supplied Source: News Corp Australia\nGarner has been a little bit more cryptic when asked why the couple split.\n“We didn’t have a shot. He’s a really good guy, and we just imploded,” she told Allure magazine in 2013. “We were full-on grown-ups, but looking back I’m aware we did not know what hit us.”\nAffleck and Garner are parents to Violet, Seraphina and Samuel.\nSecond movie together ... Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck starred in Pearl Harbour together but it was only when they reteamed together for Daredevil that they fell in love.
