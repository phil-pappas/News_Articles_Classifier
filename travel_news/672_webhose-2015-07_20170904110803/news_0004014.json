And that shouldn't be news to anyone. \nBut once in a while we like to brag about it. \nToronto-based cinematographer Chris Hau does exactly that in his video 'Show Me - Toronto', which is part of a travel series he produces. Previous locations have included Ireland and Arizona. \nFrom a glimpse at the people who actually do water sports in Lake Ontario to the historic St. Lawrence Market — and of course, the iconic skyline —this video covers both local and tourist favourites, and makes us want to visit them all right now. \nDrake would be proud.   Bar Raval Where: 505 College St. (Little Italy) Type of food: Authentic Spanish, from breakfast (dulce de leche and jamon doughnuts) to lunch and dinner (pinxtos like Galician octopus, pig head and romesco and many more). And of course, truly spectacular cocktails. Type of place: Simply stunning. It's worth going in just to see the bar itself. The Dirty Bird Chicken + Waffles Where: 79 Kensington Ave. (Kensington Market) Type of food: Like the name says, chicken and waffles, done in a decidedly (read: maple-flavoured) Canadian way. We particularly like the phrase they've coined, #northernfried.

(Ossington and College) Type of food: New Orleans down home cooking, like po' boys and oysters Type of place: This spot is actually more of a jazz bar (or bar, period), but go early if you'd prefer it a bit quieter to get a meal in Furlough Where: 924 Queen St. W. (West Queen West) Type of food: Gourmet bar snacks, including bone marrow, as well as bigger mains, like duck confit Type of place: With the same owners as Barchef, there's a serious cocktail vibe here, but also comfortable tables for brunch and dinner Hanmoto Where: 2 Lakeview Ave. (Little Portugal) Type of food: Japanese izakaya meets ... anything else really, like nasu dengaku (eggplant with beets in a miso hollandaise) and their specialty, dyno wings (giant spicy chicken wings stuffed with pork dumpling) Type of place: Hip and tiny, the owners (who also own Oddseoul and the former Swish by Han) decorated with random salvage items that somehow all fit together La Carnita (East) Where: 780 Queen St. E. (Riverside) Type of food: Gourmet Mexican street food, like corn and beef cheek tacos Type of place: Loud and fun, with tequila-based cocktails to prove it Lucky Red Where: 318 Spadina Ave. (Chinatown) Type of food: Snack-size Asian food, heavy on the bao and skilled with the cocktails Type of place: Technically not new, this reopening for Lucky Red (now with a liquor license!) retains its casual, cool feel of a place to come for late night eats and lunches alike R&D Where: 241 Spadina Ave. (Chinatown) Type of food: \"Experimental\" Asian, which is exactly what you'd expect from Masterchef Canada winner Eric Chong (the rebel in R) and world-renowned chef Alvin Leung (the demon in D), including a cleverly named 'General Sanders' Chicken' (pictured) Type of place: Large, with an industrial chic vibe, it's a spot where you can do anything from get a drink to dine for hours Tich Where: 2314 Lakeshore Blvd. W. (Mimico) Type of food: Modern Indian, like a konkani crab tikka, and a \"Tich-vich\" sea bream (pictured) Type of place: A calm and contemporary dining room, with lots of light during the day Top Gun Steak Where: 251 Augusta Ave. (Kensington Market) Type of food: Steak sandwiches and poutine — with the bonus of being halal (and they even have vegan options) Type of place: Low key diner Trinity Common Where: 303 August Ave. (Kensington Market) Type of food: Heavy bar food, like ribs, burgers and salmon — it's the craft brews that stand out here Type of place: Surprisingly pub-like for the Market, with nice wooden finishes to distinguish it The One Eighty Where: 55 Bloor St. W., 51st floor (Yorkville) Type of food: A little bit of everything, with pasta, pizza and fish dishes all on offer Type of place: The former Panorama still has the gorgeous view (obviously), but is now even heavier on the lounge atmosphere — great for dates.

The Joint: Milagro Cantina The Secret Items: A plain cheese and chicken quesadilla, as well as a shrimp burrito Why we love them: While the menu already has a shrimp taco, the shrimp burrito is a good option if you want more bang for your buck, with rice and beans and all the accompaniments. And as for the plain quesadilla, this one is for the kids. The Joint: Pizzeria Libretto The Secret Item: The Mama's Hot Pepper Pizza ($17) Why we love it: A true testament to chef Rocco Agostino's Italian roots, this secret menu pizza is made straight from his mother's recipe.

Just ask your server!

This type of popular Japanese fish is topped with coriander, pickled white ginger and citrus soya chilies.

So yes, pancakes and fries? We're in. The Joint: The Starving Artist The Secret Item: Waffle Bacon Why we love it: This breakfast/brunch joint is all about taking your plain waffle to the next level. The waffle bacon dish has waffle on the outside, bacon on the inside and served with maple syrup and icing sugar.

The Joint: Smoke's Poutinerie The Secret Item: The Slaughter House Why we love it: Toronto's famous poutine joint's Slaughter House is made with six different types of meat (beef, chili, steak, bacon, pulled pork and sausage) and topped with gravy and fries.

You can do everything from request a vegetarian version of a dish or swap out one sauce for another. Not really a secret, bu the cafe also can make customers a tuna sandwich (the menu already has a tuna melt), and a pasta salad with penne, feta, basil, olives and bell peppers. The Joint: Come And Get It The Secret Item: Customer-favourite sandwich Why we love it: Come and Get it has always been one of our favourite lunch spots with its create-your-own sandwich or poutine menu.

The Joint: The Burger's Priest The Secret Item: Noah's Ark Why we love it: Just one of the many items on the burger joint's secret menu, mushroom lovers, this one is for you.

Electric Mud, brainchild of the creators of Grand Electric, is helping change that, with a slate of sit-down, take-out and delivery options that is bringing the heat of the South to the Great White North.\" - News editor Michael Bolen Website \"Eat the pork belly buns that changed the food world forever and get full and drunk for less than $40.\" - News editor Michael Bolen Website This tasting menu only restaurant is \"arguably the best sushi joint in Toronto,\" says acting Living editor Claire Sibonney.\"It's worth the splurge for the all-out tasting menu ($150) that will have you begging for mercy by your last few courses. The restaurant is located in an Etobicoke strip mall, a reminder you're paying for the super fresh and creative food, not the flashy decor.\" Website In the word's of HuffPost Music editor Joshua Ostroff: \"The greatest taco joint of all time ever.\" Website HuffPost Style editor Chloe Tejada says Libretto is her favourite resto in Toronto because it has a \"simple menu that doesn't change too often, thin crust pizza that has so much flavour and savoury goodness.\" Also, \"their pudding is to die for.\" News editor Michael Bolen thinks Libretto has the closest imitation in the city of the blissful pie he experienced in Naples. Website This cheap spot in Little India is the probably the best food you'll get on paper plates in the city. And it's worth going just for the nan bread, which is easily the best News Editor Michael Bolen has ever had in Toronto. Sneak into the hallway kitchen to see the daring cooks throw the dough onto the walls of the volcanic tandoor ovens. Website This Spanish sensation has taken the Toronto food world by storm. And for good reason. News editor Michael Bolen says the octopus is the \"single greatest thing\" he's eaten all year in Toronto. Website According to Business editor Daniel Tencer (Polish by birth), Cafe Polonez is \"the best Polish restaurant in Canada, now that Mazurka in Montreal is history.\" Website If News editor Michael Bolen could only eat one thing for the rest of his life it would probably be the BBQ pork from King's Noodle House. Just walk in and grab a pound from the takeout counter. Ridiculously cheap, ridiculously delicious. Website Proof that Japanese is about way more than sushi, Guu has spread from Vancouver to multiple Toronto locations. Cheap, but delicious dishes and a rocking atmosphere explain why. Parentdish editor Kristy Woudstra says \"every dish is better than the next and I sort of like people shouting at me in Japanese while I smile at them like a goof.\" Website Managing editor for News Jen MacMillan votes for this Toronto institution \"mostly for the ambience of a 1980s pizza joint.\" Website (they don't have one, but there's always Yelp. \"For a true taste of the East Coast, go with four people and try the whole menu of seafood (and donair) goodness.\" - Business reporter Sunny Freeman Website \"Lovely backyard patio, my dad is a huge fan of their suckling pig.

Associate editor Emma Prestwich agrees this spot is \"worth all the hype,\" but she prefers the vegetarian \"Option,\" better-known as that \"fried mushroom thing.\" Website Entertainment editors Chris Jancelewicz thinks Barque is the \" best BBQ in the city.\" Others may disagree, but it's certainly further evidence of a the good things happening with low and slow meats in Toronto. Website According to acting Living editor Claire Sibonney, Buca provides \"artisanal and innovative Italian that never disappoints. They make every single thing on their menu from scratch, and work wonders with seasonal ingredients in unusual and delightful combinations. Oh, and the novelty of getting to cut your own thin-crust pizza with scissors provided at the table never wears off.\" Website This one isn't exactly cheap, but the fish is exceptionally fresh, according to more than one HuffPost editor. If you're tired of standard sushi, this is a great place to expand your Japanese horizons. Website Business reporter Sunny Freeman saw legendary Toronto chef Susur Lee and his sons dining at this casual (cardboard menus) Ossington hotspot serving up Singaporean street food, including some of the best Laksa in the city. Website \"Amazing food without the pretentious atmosphere or service. The menu is interesting because of the flavour pairings, not because the chef uses foam or serves microscopic portions.Time-tested and true.\" - Blogs editor Angelina Chapin.

It's also the greatest steam buns and dumplings joint outside of Northern China (and maybe inside, too.)\" - Music editor Joshua Ostroff Website (they, unsurprisingly, don't have one, but there is always Yelp) \"The brainchild of Chef Lynn Crawford serves a menu of Upscale family style meals that change daily.\" - Business reporter Sunny Freeman Website \"An amazing kale salad, well-executed Italian classics and $1/oz. wine.\" - Business reporter Sunny Freeman Website Travel editor Brian Trinh likes this low-price student joint because of the \"patio in the back, friendly service in the front and good food all around.\" His favourite? The \"killer sweet potato panini.\" Website \"Consistently ranked one of Canada's best restos, need we say more?\" - Business reporter Sunny Freeman Website \"Korean street food that goes way beyond bibimbap. It's loud and fun and reasonably priced, with giant platters of meat and a dish that is a spectacular copy of a Big Mac.\" - Living editor Rebecca Zamon Website \"Susur Lee and his son's beautiful Fusion tapas resto. Ask for the surprisingly reasonably priced chef's menu and you won't be disappointed. \" - Business reporter Sunny Freeman Website \"For someone who hasn't been to Thailand yet, I'm told this is the real deal. For vegetarians at least, the tofu nuggets, curries and pad Thai dishes are flavourful, spicy incredibly addictive. The restaurant owners have a few other (equally delicious) restos, including the overly-popular Khao San Road and a newer tapas joint, Sabai Sabai.\" - Associate Living editor Arti Patel Website Stylelist editor Sarah Kelsey likes Campagnolo for its \"amazing Italian food and bone marrow.\" Oh, and the \"awesome wine selection.\" Website The Black Hoof has long been favourites among Toronto foodies.

Plus, Union staff mix the best negroni in the city.\" - Parentdish editor Kristy Woudstra Website Into practically all-meat meals?
