By ELISABETH EAVES Continue reading the main story The Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho turned from the street into a passageway barely wide enough for two people. “Look at these dirty stairs,” he said rhapsodically, pausing to peer through a doorway at tiles of perhaps ’70s-era vintage. The passageway descended farther and took a hairpin turn into a pedestrian alley of uneven brick walls, overhead knots of electrical wire and drying laundry. “Maybe a detective could chase a criminal here,” he said, presumably imagining actors careening down the alley. “I have to shoot something here before something destroys it.” Mr. Bong, the critically acclaimed director of the dystopian thriller “Snowpiercer” as well as “The Host,” which is set in Seoul and stars a man-eating river monster, is not your average tour guide. And that was exactly the idea. I had visited the South Korean capital once before, during a rainy autumn, and while dazzled by the neon lights and spectacularly effective subway system, had barely scratched the city’s surface. Seoul is the heart of an urban area of more than 25 million people — among the largest in the world — and like any 21st-century megalopolis, it is impossible to grasp as a single entity. From N Seoul Tower, a 777-foot-spire atop an 800-foot hill, the densely packed city rolls away into the hazy distance, stopping only where it comes up against the encircling mountains. If you look down from the top, there could be hundreds of Seouls, and I didn’t know which to choose. Photo Aoi Sora, a bar that specializes in daytime drinking, in the Hannam neighborhood of Seoul. Credit Adam Dean for The New York Times I knew, though, that I wanted to see contemporary culture beyond the best-known exports — the television shows that are staples across Asia and the perfectly choreographed K-pop videos. And so I sought out native informants, each a creative force unto his or herself: Shin Kyung-sook, a best-selling novelist; the fashion designer Juyoung Lee; Kim Sehwang, a musician; and Mr. Bong. I invited each to show me a part of Seoul that inspired them or held special meaning. One invited me to a museum, one to her place of work, and the other two to favorite neighborhoods. They decided which versions of Seoul I would see. “Snowpiercer” was based on a French graphic novel and shot in the Czech Republic with actors from at least seven nations. In it, people of all classes, humanity’s last survivors, are jammed together on a hurtling train. I should not have been surprised, then, that Mr. Bong, 45, chose to share a global Seoul. To get to our rendezvous, I climbed the sloping streets of the Itaewon neighborhood, past a cluster of gay and transgender bars, and, farther on, an increasing quotient of Middle Eastern restaurants. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story In Itaewon, you can take a date or business associate out for a suitably impressive dinner on Itaewon-ro No. 27, or get a cellphone hooked up after hours in Nigerian Alley, side streets that respectively draw full-freight expats and the scrappier remittance class. I passed these places on my way to meet Mr. Bong at the Seoul Central Mosque, set on a hilltop where Itaewon meets the neighborhood of Hannam, its dome and twin minarets a beacon to Korea’s tiny minority of Muslims. While Friday congregants milled behind us in the late afternoon sun, we sat on a bench that looked out over the city. “This part of Seoul is amazing,” he said. “It symbolizes the incoherence of a city that doesn’t have strong continuity.” He held his hands up and made a rectangle with his fingers, framing an imaginary shot. “Look at the layers,” he said.

Beyond lay the Han River and too many high-rises to count. “In five or 10 years these old houses will be gone,” he said. “This is a city of destruction and reconstruction.” As the call to prayer sounded, Mr. Bong led me away from the mosque and onto a narrow street, Usadan-ro No. 10. The businesses we passed fell roughly into three categories. There were specialty shops — haberdashery, hardware — where it appeared neither staff nor signage had changed in 50 years. There were restaurants of more recent origin serving kosher Korean food or Turkish kebabs. And then there were the newest arrivals: a three-month-old wine bar, a juice bar, a tattoo-studio-slash-art-gallery called Soul Ink, a clothing shop in which every item was either black or white. One cafe sported a name that, as near as I could figure out, roughly translates as “maybe we’re open today”; two invitingly fluffy white Samoyeds named Cloud and Storm “work part time,” according to the barista. The neighborhood hovered in that sweet spot just before people start complaining about gentrification. “Here it all mixes very naturally,” Mr. Bong said. We walked farther down the street to a bar called Aoi Sora with a triangular sign. It specializes in daytime drinking, Mr. Bong said; from Monday to Thursday, it closes at 7 p.m. Inside, by the light of a single large square window at the back, he ordered clams in their shells and a bottle of clear alcohol with a ginseng root winding through it, which was not on the menu but was created by the bartender, who in his off hours teaches a class in traditional booze-making. We sipped from small ceramic cups, and Mr. Bong talked more about his changing city. “Every alley has its own story,” he said. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Over eight days in Seoul, destruction and transformation were regular themes. Ms. Shin, the novelist, explained her city this way: “In Paris or New York, when you have an appointment with a friend, you can meet her in the same place that you did a year ago. In Seoul, you can’t, because there will be something new there.” New Yorkers may quibble, but her point stands; in Seoul the change is especially fast and comprehensive. But, Ms. Shin said, those same qualities are part of the city’s dynamism and energy. They are also ones essential to her work. Ms. Shin, 52, is the author of “Please Look After Mom,” which sold more than a million copies in Korea and was published in English in 2011. In it, an old woman from the countryside comes to visit her grown children in Seoul. She makes it as far as the central train station and then disappears, lost in the matrix of the shape-shifting city. “Seoul is an important backdrop because I wanted to represent the clash between generations,” Ms. Shin said.

There are serene oases in its parks and greenways, on the grounds of its centuries-old palaces and in its museums. Ms. Shin asked me to meet her at the Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art. It displays Korean art through the centuries, as well as contemporary works by both Korean artists — like the video-art pioneer Nam June Paik — and international stars like Andreas Gursky and Louise Bourgeois. When we arrived just before opening, an air of tranquillity prevailed. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T21:33:02.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
