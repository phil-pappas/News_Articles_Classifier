Sign In Here Native son Anthony Foxx , the U.S. transportation secretary, was in town this week for the opening of Charlotte’s streetcar line. And he turned a ho-hum ribbon-cutting into a sharply partisan plea for further investment in transit. Foxx was mayor when Charlotte won a federal grant for $25 million to build the 1.5-mile streetcar segment that opened Tuesday along Elizabeth Avenue. Construction costs totaled $37 million, with city taxpayers providing the $12 million not covered by the federal grant. Lack of money from the local half-cent transit tax prompted Foxx and other City Council Democrats to push for the city to use other revenue sources to pay the city’s share of the streetcar’s costs. Republicans in local and state government have fought the project ever since. On Tuesday, Foxx took aim at each of the arguments leveled against the streetcar. During his remarks at the Charlotte Transportation Center, he said, “This project is an example of action-based dialogue. Nothing about it has been easy or will be easy, but in the process of making it happen, Charlotte has a chance to turn the page. This is not a streetcar to nowhere — in fact, if it is, then my hometown is Nowhere, North Carolina, because I grew up on the west end of the streetcar line.” Foxx added: “I’ve had my fair share of backseat driving from Raleigh (as mayor) and while you can’t ignore Raleigh, I can. And I’m going to tell you, Charlotte, don’t stop building for the future. Be an example to people all around this country of how folks can live together and grow together.” A planned 2.5-mile extension of the streetcar line is to be paid for with $75 million from various city sources and a grant of $75 million included (but not yet approved) in the federal budget. Construction of the extension would start next year and be finished in late 2019. Closer Look Lengthy agenda for CATS’ new leader John Lewis Jr. , named Monday to run the Charlotte Area Transit System , might have the perfect skills for the job: a black belt in jujitsu and experience running marathons. As executive director at CATS, he likely will need an ability to reverse political fortunes and the stamina to stay in it for the long run. He inherits a transit system with major projects under way, including the 1.5-mile streetcar line and a planned 2.5-mile expansion, as well as the 9-mile, $1.2 billion extension of the light-rail line from uptown to UNC Charlotte. Lewis ran the Central Florida Regional Transit Authority in Orlando, Fla., for five years before accepting the job at CATS. He will earn $229,000 annually. \nWant Charlotte Travel news in your inbox?
