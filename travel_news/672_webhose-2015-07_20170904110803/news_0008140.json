The introduction of smart energy meters will help with this: homeowners will be able to track spending and monitor their energy usage in real time. But until then, what causes the fluctuations you often find in your energy bills? Research by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs shows that £1 out of every £3 spent on lighting and heating our homes is wasted. Simple changes in your lifestyle can save a considerable amount of energy during the year. Buy energy-saving bulbs? An energy-saving light bulb will cost you £3-£4 compared to about 50p for a normal bulb, but will put money back into your pocket by saving you around £9 on your annual electricity bill and up to £100 over its lifetime. ...and turn them off Turn your lights off when you’re not using them. If you switch a light off for just a few seconds, you will save more energy than it takes for the light to start up again, regardless of the type of light. This will save you around £15 on your annual energy bills. Don't use standby Turn off your household appliances when you’re not using them. TVs, microwaves, computers, DVD players… they all continue to use energy when they are left on standby. You can save around £30 a year just by remembering to turn these appliances off standby mode. Boil what you need... Only fill the kettle with the amount of water that you need, and you can save around £20 a year. Wash on cold The majority of washing machines heat cold water to whichever temperature you set. Lower the temperature to 30C: washing powder technology is now designed to work as effectively at lower temperatures, so washing at higher temperatures is unnecessary. Washing at 30C rather than 40C can save you a third of the cost of running the cycle. Ditch the dryer Tumble dryers are incredibly energy-greedy. Which? calculates that one load in a C-rated electric tumble dryer costs around 49p, compared to just 14p per load in an A-rated heat pump dryer (or better yet, hang your clothes outside to dry for free!) • Learn about smart meters and find out how you can save money and time to spend on the things you love.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T14:56:59.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
