The rate has been rising for 12 consecutive years since 2003. Of the couples filing for divorce, 40 per cent of them took the step after being married for just three years. The data also revealed that couples born in the Eighties had the highest divorce rate. Retired star hurdler Liu Xiang's divorce sparked a heated online debate just days ago. Liu was born in 1983. Most couples born in the Eighties were pampered when they were young as they were their only child, so they have problems in tolerating and adjusting to life with their other half, said Fang Xiaoyi, head of the Institute of Developmental Psychology at Beijing Normal University. Some commentators claimed that they are not surprised by the high divorce rate among couples born in the Eighties. Most couples born in the Sixties and Seventies are now aged between 45 and 55, and their marriages have tested the ups and downs of life, so most of their attention now is on taking care of their parents and children. By contrast, Eighties-born couples are now aged only between 26 and 35, and have just started their marital life, so they face the daunting pressure of getting along with their spouses and also taking care of their children. As a result, it's natural that many couples born in the Eighties have the highest divorce rate so far, given that most of those born after 1990 haven't got married yet, according to a comment piece in China Youth Daily . More unhappy couples are choosing to divorce to give themselves a second chance at happiness Another major contributor to the high divorce rate may be that improvements to the legal system have made divorces a lot easier to arrange. After its revision in 2003, China's marriage-registration regulation simplified the divorce procedures and reduced its cost, which led to a hike in divorce rate in 2004 with 1.665 million couples choosing to divorce that year. Additionally, the emergence of fake divorce in recent years in exchange for more benefits such as demolition compensation, more homes or evading the husband-and-wife common debts may also account for the rising divorce rate. Figures show that 14,574 more couples were divorced in 2010 in the eastern city of Nanjing than the previous year after house-purchase restrictions took effect in October of 2010, capping the maximum number of houses a couple can own. Besides, people today have higher expectations and more emotional demands for marriage, but fail to develop the skills to bridge the communication gap between women and men, as articulated in the book, Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus . What’s more, women are becoming more financially independent and society is also becoming increasingly tolerant of divorcees. And these days, more unhappy couples are choosing to divorce to give themselves a second chance at happiness. The steadily rising divorce rate is not something unique to China. Data on divorce rates in major developed economies released by Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in early 2015 showed that the divorce rate in the country was 1.77 out of 1,000 couples, taking the sixth spot just ahead of Italy, at 0.91. The top five countries were Russia, the US, Germany, Britain and France with divorce rates of 4.5, 3.6, 2.19, 2.05 and 1.97 respectively. That 3.63 million Chinese couples were divorced in 2014 means the divorce rate in China is 2.67, given that the total population of the country was 1.36 billion at the end of 2014. What's more, a high divorce rate doesn't necessarily mean that modern people are losing faith in marriage, because although many people choose to remarry, governments rarely keep track of the remarriage rate.
