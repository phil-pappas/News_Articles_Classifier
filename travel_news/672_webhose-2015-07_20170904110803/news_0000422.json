Moise, 72, has the kind of ramrod discipline that comes from a military school education and decades catching people who thought they could get away with keeping undersized crabs or baiting doves with cracked corn.\nHis specialty is the Frogmore stew. The first thing to know about Frogmore stew is that it contains no frogs. The second is that it’s not much of a stew. At its most basic, the Frogmore is a mix of shrimp, sausage and corn that have been boiled briefly in spiced water.\nThe odds are good that if you go to a summer party along the coast of Georgia or South Carolina, the host will make one. It is communal eating at its best, a practice the South has made into an art form.\nLowcountry boil This particular summer, as Charleston, S.C., begins to heal from the massacre at one of its oldest black churches, eating a Frogmore together will hold even more significance.\nSusan Wigley hosted a Frogmore at her home on the Ashley River in early June to showcase Moise’s talents for a reporter and the local chapter of Les Dames d’Escoffier, an international organization of women in the culinary profession. On Thursday, she and other members took macaroni and cheese and pies to the funeral of one of the shooting victims.\n“People gather together to feel better when you’ve had a horrible experience, and in the South, that means we eat,” Wigley said. “This time of year, with all that fresh shrimp coming in, we’re going to be eating shrimp. And we’re going to be eating it together.”\nAt restaurants, the Frogmore stew is more often called a Lowcountry boil. Some simply call it a Beaufort boil. Across the country, its star has risen along with those of other Southern dishes.\nBut Frogmore stew is not a traditional Southern dish, nor are its roots in African culture, like so much Lowcountry cooking.\nResearch by a librarian in Beaufort County, southwest of Charleston, traces the first Frogmore stew to a shrimper named Richard Gay. During the 1960s, he threw shrimp and leftovers into a pot of boiling water while he was on a National Guard exercise. He named it after Frogmore, a community on St. Helena Island.\nMoise has made so many batches, for fun and for profit, that he can’t count them all. He once cooked enough to feed a thousand people, he said.\nMoise follows a precise recipe. It starts with a propane burner, outfitted with a metal ring and a high-pressure regulator, topped with a pot big enough to wash a small dog.\nHe fills the pot, fitted with a giant strainer, with water and a couple of handfuls of what he calls “dust.” These days, he uses the commercial seasoning sold under the Old Bay label, but he spent years making his own. It was hot, he said, “but not gum-tickling hot.” A Frogmore is never as spicy as its Cajun cousins.\nOnce the water boils, he adds half-inch-thick slices of Hillshire sausage cut on the diagonal and frozen 3-inch corn cobettes that one may find at the local Piggly Wiggly. Once the water returns to the boil, he adds small Carolina shrimp and cooks them for exactly 2½ minutes.\nMore dust is added once the strainer is pulled from the pot, and its contents are dumped into a bowl or onto a newspaper-covered table.\nIt is easy to find dozens of recipes for a Lowcountry boil, many of which add blue crab and vegetables like boiled red potatoes and onions. “Gilding the lily,” Moise said. Onions make the shrimp too slippery to peel, he said, and starch from the potatoes can make the shrimp stick to the shells.\nPotatoes and corn There has been little scholarly examination of the polyamorous marriage of potatoes, corn and seafood in the nation’s boils. The trio shows up in the New England clambake and its boiled version. Lobster boils, too, rely on potatoes and corn to round out supper.\nThe combination came from the North, not the South, said Oliver, the food historian. Native Americans likely added corn to region’s early clambakes and lobster boils, and the potato joined the party in the mid- to late 1800s, when groups of middle-class diners along the Eastern Seaboard took trains and trolleys to the coast for what were called shore dinners. Corn, cucumbers, salt potatoes and brown bread were staples, served alongside steamed or boiled shellfish.\nThe potato plays a key role in the Great Lakes fish boil, which also features lake trout or hunks of whitefish cooked in a bag that floats in a pot of water seasoned with onions, bay leaves, whole allspice and peppercorns.\nIn Port Wing, Wis., on the western shore of Lake Superior, summer culminates with a big Labor Day fish boil whose dramatic peak is called the overboil.\nOnce the ingredients have finished cooking in caldrons set over wood fires, the cook throws kerosene or other fuel on the fire. The rush of heat makes the caldron boil furiously, so the proteins and oils from the fish rise to the top and flow over the edge.\nRitual is just as important in the Chesapeake Bay area, where they wouldn’t dream of boiling a crab. In the Mid-Atlantic, crabs are steamed. Purists say it keeps the meat sweeter and firmer, and allows for better spice control. (It should be noted that boiling proponents say steaming dries out the crabmeat.)\nThe spices — Old Bay or a salty mix developed by the J.O. Spice Company — are sprinkled on the crabs while they cook, and served on the table.\nIn Texas, where children learn early how to catch crab with a chicken neck on a string, a summer seafood boil will feature either blue crab, shrimp or both.\nA good amount of commercial crab boil seasoning like Zatarain’s goes into the pot. Beer is essential. Sometimes it goes in the pot, but more often keeps everyone entertained during the hours it takes to crack enough crabs for a proper supper. And it can take a lot, especially with smaller crabs.\n“The one thing about crabs is that they have become way more valuable in Maryland than people are willing to pay for in Texas, so all the jumbo 6-inch crabs get exported,” said Robb Walsh, a Texas food writer.\nHe sometimes applies a “Cajun-Asian” approach, developed by Vietnamese cooks who transformed the boils when they settled in Louisiana after the Vietnam War and now serve Cajun-spiced seafood drenched in butter and garlic in restaurants as far west as Los Angeles.\nThe wildest boiled seafood in the country remains in the Acadiana region of Louisiana, where it’s not unusual to see a seafood-boiling rig being pulled behind a pickup.\nCrawfish boiling season ends in the late spring, giving way to summer shrimp and crab boils whose emphasis is on heat and variety.\nA boil here is likely to be spiced with a permeable pouch of shrimp and crab boil seasoning mixed with various brands of Creole seasoning and cayenne. An accompanying parade of vegetables may include whole button mushrooms, celery and peppers, along with corn and potatoes. Garlic and lemon are tossed in, along with a stick of butter, which cooks say makes the shrimp easier to peel.\nWhatever the region or style, America’s summertime seafood boils all share one sure pleasure. As Moise put it, “If you are standing up and eating with your fingers, you got to be having a good time.”\nKIM SEVERSON", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T14:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T16:14:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
