With this service, passengers at Germany’s largest aviation hub are picked up at a pre-agreed meeting place in the terminal by a trained service assistant who takes care of their bags and the check-in process for them. Next, the service assistant escorts the passengers through a separate security checkpoint and, if necessary, through passport control. To provide an exclusive transfer service a chauffeured luxury limousine is available to bring the passengers across the apron directly to the departure gate. \nThe service costs 85 euros for up to four persons traveling on the same flight. Passengers can take advantage of FRA’s Check-In to Gate Service, regardless of their airline and booking class. Reservations must be made at least 48 hours before departing from FRA. Bookings at shorter notice may be possible upon request. Cancellations are only free of charge up to 24 hours prior to the arranged time and date. The new service can be conveniently booked online via FRA’s portal . \nThe Check-In to Gate Service at Frankfurt Airport is part of the “Great to have you here!” service quality program launched by Fraport AG (the owner and manager of FRA) with the goal of continually enhancing the travel experience at Germany’s largest aviation hub. Other services under this program include the Frankfurt Airport App 2.0 and free 24-hour Wi-Fi Internet access offered in the passenger terminals. \nMore details about Frankfurt Airport’s wide range of services and facilities are available via FRA’s travel website and the social media channels on Twitter , Facebook , Youtube , Pinterest , and Instagram .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T23:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T23:53:22.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
