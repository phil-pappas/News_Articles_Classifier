Over 11 years I built my own company, Corinne & Friends, which over time has become one of the biggest salons in Scandinavia and one of the strongest brands in the industry.\nMy team and I are the spokespeople for different brands. We do TV production including Pop Idol, Top Model, Eurovision, and many other fashion assignments through our agency, C&F Agency. My team, my clients in the salon, and people on different assignments had asked for hair accessories, so 10 years ago I started to search on my trips around the world. I saw a gap in the market in this segment and decided to start working on my own hair accessories collection.\nNow I am very proud to present my collection and the concept. It’s a sophisticated, timeless, high-quality line, packaged in a luxurious way. The price range is medium to high.\nPhoto: Courtesy of Corinne & Friends\nWhat, in your view, are the current trends in hair accessories?\nAccessories began to appear on the fashion scene a few years ago. Many of the large, established fashion brands choose to use them for hairstyles on the catwalk. A mixture of metal buckles, leather, and flowers are sometimes used in models’ hair as accessories. For example, hairstylists make small braids to fasten the hair up or just wrap it around a tassel like a hair twist.\nYou worked with Swedish model Caroline Winberg on the shoot; any particular reason why?\nWe got to know each other a bit more when we worked on Top Model, which took place in Cape Town, for two months.\nWhere can one purchase your products?\nAt Corinne & Friends , select stores, and online at www.corinne.world .\nPhoto: Courtesy of Corinne & Friends", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php", "http://www.corinne.world/"], "published": "2015-07-06T22:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T21:33:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
