Do I need a fake Indian number? I'm reading many posts about booking trains, but some of them are quite old so I don't know if they all apply. I have read the articles and tutorials on this site as well, but many of the websites have changed since the articles were written. Thanks for any insight you can provide. I am just trying to check seat availability from Delhi to Jaisalmer the evening of October 20, but looks like I need an account to do this. Seems like with a fake phone number this may take many days? Before I enter my mobile, I'm just trying to figure out why it should be fake.
