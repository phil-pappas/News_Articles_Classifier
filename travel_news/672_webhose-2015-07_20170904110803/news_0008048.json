Authorities discovered a 2-foot-by-2-foot hole in the shower floor and 30 feet beneath it a mile-long tunnel equipped with lighting, ventilation and a motorcycle on rails. At the other end of the tunnel was a hole in the ground at a construction site.\nAt a news conference, National Security Commissioner Monte Alejandro Rubido showed the video and said that prison employees who had been working during the escape would be questioned by authorities.\nU.S. officials say Mexico has refused their offers to aid in the manhunt for Guzmán.\n“It’s kind of like a joke,” Carl Pike, a retired Drug Enforcement Administration official told The Times on Tuesday. “’Gee, a tunnel. Who would have thought? It’s kind of a no-brainer.”\nDrug Enforcement Administration documents show that the agency warned Mexican officials 16 months ago about an escape attempt, immediately after Guzmán was caught, according to The Associated Press.\n His last escape, in 2001, was thought to be by laundry cart.\nKATIE ROGERS", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/JGmVVVNIDeY?feature=oembed"], "published": "2015-07-15T16:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T22:23:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
