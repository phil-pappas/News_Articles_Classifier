With the onset of the AEC, tourism is poised among potential sectors that will see greater collaboration among the member countries.Mrs. Juthaporn Rerngronasa, TAT Acting Governor and Deputy Governor for International Marketing (Europe, Africa, Middle East and Americas) said, “The two-day ASEAN One Multicultural Festival 2015 is in line with the Royal Thai Government’s policy to place great emphasis on promoting Thailand’s unique entity or Thainess that will help enhance Thailand’s reputation as a unique and must-visit tourist destination in ASEAN as well as further strengthen the kingdom’s long-standing geographical advantage as the centre of ASEAN and the region’s hub for connectivity.”\nMrs. Juthaporn said, “ASEAN is the region of diverse cultures and traditions, and different national identities. The 10 nations share many common characteristics, and at the same time, each nation has its own distinct entity. This ASEAN One Multicultural Festival 2015 is set as a centre stage to showcase the cultural similarities and unique differences of each member nation.”\nThe ASEAN One Multicultural Festival 2015, to take place at Thapae Gate, Chiang Mai, will be presented in four distinctive zones.The ‘ASEAN One’ zone will feature musical performances from leading singers and musicians from all of the ASEAN countries. The highlight is the special performance by singers from ASEAN countries who will join in the singing of the ‘ASEAN One’ song, particularly composed for this event.\nThe ‘We are ASEAN’ zone will showcase images of the ASEAN people and the local ways of life of the people in each country. The images will be fascinatingly woven into a motion picture and portrayed on the wall of the famous Thapae Gate.The ‘ASEAN Pavilion’ zone will showcase the diverse culture and national identity of each member country through a photo exhibition, demonstration of making arts, crafts and handmade products as well as cultural performances.\nSource:-TAT\nRelated Posts Despite Political Chaos in Thailand, Spain Expecting More Thai Tourists THAI Celebrates Her Majesty the Queen’s Birthday with Special Air Fares Prince Harry enjoys New Zealand island escape Thailand Tourism Festival 2013 underway on sidelines of TTM+ Destination NSW Regional Manager UK And Germany Appointed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T09:53:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
