It would be nearly impossible to see everything it has to offer if you only had a short time on the ground. That's why a helicopter tour is the best way to see the Grand Canyon, especially considering you can see up to three quarters of the National Park in less than an hour. You would take months trekking around the park if you wanted to take in all of the sites that you can see from a helicopter tour. And even if you managed to make it around all of the park's beautiful spots, you wouldn't be able to see them in their full splendor. A helicopter allows for the best views of the Canyon, and there's simply no experience like a South Rim flight. South Rim Tours There are some different tour options for South Rim visitors, so you'll be able to choose a package that suits your sense of adventure as well as your budget. The most affordable option would be the 30 minute helicopter ride which will take you to the North Rim and back to the South. This tour will even take you down into the Dragoon Corridor, a spectacularly beautiful part of the Canyon that is also its widest point. If you like the sound of the shorter helicopter tour but still want a little more, why not try a tour that includes a 4x4 Jeep ride. You'll take the same South Rim air tour, but you'll also travel on the ground to some of the National Park's most famous landmarks like the Grand Canyon Village, and Mather, Yaki, and Yavapai Points. During the peak of summer season the roads around the park can get fairly busy. A Jeep tour allows you to see more from the ground because you won't be traveling on the beaten path. If you want to see all that the canyon has to offer from the air then the 50 minute helicopter ride would be your best option. It covers everything that the shorter flight does, and you'll also fly over all of the points that you can visit on the Jeep tour. The 20 minutes extra flight time means you will see more of the eerily isolated North Rim, Imperial Point, the Colorado River Confluence, and even the Temple of Ra, a stunning pyramid-like rock formation. This is by far the best package available, allowing you to see almost all of the National Park. (There is an airplane tour which follows an identical route to the 50 minute helicopter tour. I recommend the helicopter tours, even the shorter ones, simply because you will have a better view of the sights. The airplanes fly at much higher altitudes, and with smaller port windows you won't feel as close to the Canyon as you do in a helicopter.) Choosing Between The Deluxe And Basic Tours You can choose the 30 or 50 minute tour in either a basic or deluxe package. The difference between the two is the helicopter that you will fly in. Basic tours use either a Eurocopter AStar or Bell Ranger, while the deluxe tours use the newer EcoStar 130 helicopter. The EcoStar has more comfortable seating, and a wraparound window design that offers the best views from the air. The EcoStar is also much quieter from inside the cabin, allowing for the most pleasant flight. I recommend paying extra for a deluxe tour if you can, but that's not to say that a basic tour won't provide you with an unforgettable experience. South Rim helicopter tours have become increasingly popular in recent years, and today a helicopter tour is usually the first on the priority list for those who visit the Grand Canyon. This also means that you need to do some planning around your flight. Make sure you book in advance, preferably as soon as you've confirmed your hotel booking. Booking late can mean that tickets are more expensive, and you even risk being disappointed if flights are booked out. If you're visiting the Canyon, you absolutely have to take the opportunity to experience a helicopter tour. There's simply no better way to see the Grand Canyon.
