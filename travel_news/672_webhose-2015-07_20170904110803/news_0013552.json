Roman Architecture \nCountries like Italy and Turkey are famous for their Roman architectural wonders, but did you know that Croatia is also home to Roman temples, amphitheaters, palaces, and other structures?

Croatia Isn't Your Typical European Destination \nIf you live in the States, the announcement that you're traveling to Croatia will possibly be met with three questions: What? Where? . . . Why? Croatia isn't the most expected destination for Americans, and traveling to locations others would be hard pressed to identify on a map is enough reason to go anywhere. But your photos of Croatia, and tales of your experiences, will put you in a position of envy among your friends and maybe even encourage others to travel, too.
