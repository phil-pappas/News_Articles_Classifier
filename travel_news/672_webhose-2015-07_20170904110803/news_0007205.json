It may be straightforward, it may be surreal. All you have to do is post a caption to go with it in the Comment section below or on our Comment Facebook page here. I'll leave it up for a week, when the winner with the wittiest, cleverest or just plain funniest offering will be announced and published. The author of the winning caption will win the original cartoon artwork with their caption written under it. (All he or she will have to do is – once they've seen they've won – email cartoonist@telegraph.co.uk giving me their postal address.) Good luck!
