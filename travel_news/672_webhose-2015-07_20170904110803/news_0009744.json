These bags do not come cheap, but the tradeoff in quality and dependability is more than worth it especially for travelers headed to Europe where carry-on standards are more strict. \nAlthough I have recently become a huge fan of four-wheeled bags, this trendy and dutiful piece of carry-on luggage has certainly caught my eye. It is often seen as a frequent visitor to the luggage carousel, but savvy travelers know better by marking their luggage with a colorful tag to differentiate it from the rest. It expands easily and readily when full, a feature that I must have on my travels since I hoard souvenirs at almost every stop. \nThe exterior ballistic nylon outer fabric resists water and dirt that almost always accumulates when airline employees let bags sit in the natural elements too long. Who can avoid regional jets these daysâ€¦and I detest watching my expensive luggage getting drenched. With this bag, I can at least take comfort in the hybrid fiberglass frame that keeps the bag sturdy and protected. \nI do prefer a four-wheeled bag since I tend to stuff my bag to its weight limit making it more of a strain to pull behind me, but this bag was not too much of an effort to drag when I filled it. It should be mentioned that I always travel with a laptop case atop my rollaboard (as many business travelers do), but this bag did not prove inconvenient even with the added weight. \nUnlike some bags, this bag has its outer handle casing on the exterior of the bag, which dramatically increases the space for overstuffing your bag on the inside. Unfortunately, it could also make it harder to stuff in the overhead bin on really full flights although I have yet to ever have a problem. \nMy favorite feature is the exterior pocket access allowing me to grab items like keys and passports instantly without digging for travel cases inside. Even with my laptop case, I hate to open the zippered pocket because it is easy to forget to seal again when in a rush. \nThis convenient travel bag is guaranteed for life and available for $449 from Briggs & Riley or ebags.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T15:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T01:58:54.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
