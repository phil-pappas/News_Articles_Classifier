The service that offers affordable mobile data helping companies overcome their connectivity challenges now covers the majority of the globe and enhances its presence in Africa in particular. ￼ This announcement follows a recent partnership with Vodafone to increase the Goodspeed mobile Wi-Fi footprint. The first stage of the agreement has now been implemented with 12 new destinations available on Goodspeed; Albania, Malta, Romania, Turkey, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania and New Zealand.. \nIn the new African destinations and New Zealand, Goodspeed users can now consume up to 500 MB of data a day for a flat rate of £8.20 (or $13.99), and in the new European destinations for £4.90 (or $7.99). Goodspeed’s fixed and affordable fees guarantee predictable mobile data costs for companies whose mobile employees depend on a data connection to stay productive when travelling. The secure personal Wi-Fi connection also ensures the company data is kept inside the business even when the staff is on the go. Tommi Uhari, CEO of Uros, comments: “By enhancing Goodspeed’s offering on such a large scale it is a huge acceleration in our campaign to put an end to mobile connectivity issues. I’m especially excited that we can now offer our service in large parts of Africa which is the fastest growing mobile market in the world, and where roaming fees have been checkered.” The service is enabled by the Goodspeed hotspot, which can accommodate and switch automatically between ten SIM cards. The device and destination SIM cards can be purchased from goodspeed.io and through Goodspeed direct sales channels, including Business Sales and official Goodspeed distributors before travelling.
