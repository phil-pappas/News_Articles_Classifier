Spoiler: not many people did. \nLuckily, Lazo explained how the terms differ. In short, \"Hispanic\" focuses on Spanish-speaking origin. This means Spain is included, but Brazil is not because Brazilians speak Portuguese. \"Latino\" refers to people of Latin American origin. This includes Brazil and excludes Spain. \n\"Hispanic is basically based on whether you or your family speak the language of Spanish whereas Latino is focusing more on geographic location, that being Latin America,\" Lazo said in the video. \nOne man on the streets of New York helped Lazo with her explanation when he talked about his experience with the term \"Spanish.\" \"I hate when people call me Spanish because I’m not,\" he said. \"If you’re Spanish it’s because you’re from Spain.\" \nIt's important to note that just because people speak Spanish, it doesn't mean they're Spanish. It's a language, and it's also a term referring to nationality. \nAnd there you have it. They may just be three words, but they pack quite a meaningful punch. \nAlso on The Huffington Post:  24 Words You Didn't Know Were Spanish of", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T01:03:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
