It’s a totally rewarding experience!Here’s some testimonials from other volunteers who have signed up with uVolunteer for a volunteer vacation in Thailand . Micquella Galea reported, “As soon as I touched down in Trat I was in love. The place is so inviting and the people are so kind. I was met by Meaw at Trat Airport and from there on time just flew by, my 3 weeks went by just like that. That is not to say it was all perfect, I had my moments where the culture shock kicked in which was mainly on my first night, but after that I saw the true charm of Thailand and its people.” Of course, it’s not all work and no play. According to Aaron Joseph, “I went sightseeing with Eiw and Alex. We visited a big temple where Eiw prayed to Buddha and got a very good fortune from a fortune teller.We rented a motorcycle today! We rode around the island and went to a cliff top viewpoint overlooking the ocean which was very beautiful. We stopped at a beach and had lunch at a restaurant with tables right at the water's edge.”After the work week in Thailand, volunteers have plenty of time to explore on the weekends. Take a visit to the Khao Kheow Open Zoo and the Marine Scientific Institute in Bangkok. Another fun adventure is the wildlife sanctuary in Kung Krabane. Take a journey through its deep mangrove forest where you view endangered species like Indian muntjac and mouse-deer.All around, uVolunteer provides an unforgettable volunteer vacation experience. ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T12:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T15:53:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
