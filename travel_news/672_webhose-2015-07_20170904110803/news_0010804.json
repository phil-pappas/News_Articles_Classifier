The evolution of the group’s current offering – Macdonald Meetings – is the result of a year of in-depth research and data collection from conference organisers, booking agents, direct corporate bookers, event management companies and industry experts. \nGill Jackson, Sales Director at Macdonald Hotels & Resorts, highlights: “Everyone attending a group meeting or event is an individual and Macdonald Hotels commits to personalising their experience. To achieve this, we are redefining our core brand standards to provide delegates with an element of choice throughout their time with us, catering to their personal tastes. “We have been in the business of hospitality for 25 years and wanted to mark our celebratory year by launching Macdonald Meetings, a product of our 25 year track record of delivering successful meetings. It's our knowledge and experience that gives us an inherent understanding of delegate needs and exceeding expectations.” “We’ve listened to our customers directly for this new direction, using our research to form the basis of our new promises to bookers. This research has indicated a range of key drivers of conference satisfaction, these being flexibility and responsiveness to a booker’s request, friendliness and helpfulness of the team pre and post-event, maintenance and upkeep of the venue, quality food and beverage offering on the day and a clear understanding of the priorities and goals of the meeting or conference.” As part of the re-launch, Macdonald Hotels & Resorts has defined five critical touch points which will ensure that the key objectives for any agent or corporate booker are met with a series of promises that will incorporate the element of ‘time’, offering dedicated account managers and booking consultants, speedy and efficient enquiry turnaround times – with the promise of a 30 minute response time for agents, and the very best rates from the initial onset. Jackson continues: “Time is a major factor that affects all aspects of the business and we understand how precious this is to our corporate guests. With this in mind, it was integral that the theme of time formed a major part of the evolution of our meeting and conference offering. “These changes that we’re set to implement will bring the Macdonald Hotels & Resorts brand to the forefront of mind for key decision makers in the industry and allow us to stand out in the competitive marketplace.” Macdonald Hotel & Resorts will be launching the new Macdonald Meetings concept at the Meeting Show 2015, on stand No: F33, at the Olympia Exhibition Centre in London between 7th and 9th July.
