But if you want to feel even thirstier in Arica, head five miles southeast out of the city. I predict you'll suddenly be in the mood for an ice-cold Coke.\nChile built Coca-Cola's most ambitious ad.\nIn 1986, Coca-Cola employees in Arica assembled the company's biggest marketing campaign ever on a hill called Cerro Sombrero. More than 70,000 empty Coke bottles were arranged in the sand over a 400-by-150 foot area to celebrate the company's centennial. The ginormous final product, visible from miles away, reads \"Coca-Cola: 100 Años\" (meaning \"100 years\").\nThe billboard got a facelift in 2011.\nFour years ago, Coke's Chile division made sure the logo stayed current: they trekked back to the site, repaired 25 years of damage, and rearranged bottles to update the logo. The subtitle now reads \"125 Años.\" Presumably, the company now regrets designing an ad the size of a football field that becomes more obsolete every single year.\nAttention aliens! Coke is it.\nThe hillside logo is perfectly visible from ground level, so it was probably intended as a local billboard, not as a lure to passing flying saucers. But today, in the age of digital mapping, we all have unprecedented access to high-quality aerial imagery. As a result, companies are getting more savvy about this kind of Google Earth presence, which is sometimes called \"mapvertising.\" The giant Coke logo has become a landmark worldwide.\nAustralia's giant aerial billboard is over 20 years older.\nBelieve it or not, the Coca-Cola logo wasn't the first \"mapvertisement\" ever created, or the biggest. In 1965, workers constructing the Eyre Highway across Nullarbor Plain in Western Australia used some spare concrete to draw a two-mile-long Readymix logo in the middle of the desert. Supposedly, the logo marked an emergency airstrip, but no one ever landed there. Today the logo is overgrown and hard to read, but during the 1960s, when humankind first went into orbit, it was the world's only text to be visible from space.\nMore from Conde Nast Traveler\nTop 25 Resorts in the United States\n10 Beautiful Resorts on American Lakes\nThe World's Best Cruise Ships\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2014-08-28/10-beautiful-resorts-on-american-lakes?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fAActxP5%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fAActGqq.img&description=Getty", "http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2014-10-20/top-25-resorts-in-the-united-states-readers-choice-awards-2014?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2015-03-03/maphead-ken-jennings-atacama-desert-chile-driest-spot-on-earth?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://www.cntraveler.com/?mbid=synd_msn", "http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2015-06-03/top-cruise-ships-readers-choice-awards-2014?mbid=synd_msntravel"], "published": "2015-07-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T04:02:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
