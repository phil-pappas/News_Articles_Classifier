Sainsbury’s has 300. \nAvishai Moor, Sainsbury’s head of fuel, said: “This is another great piece of news for our customers today, following the announcement that fuel duty will remain at the same level this year. \n“Fuel can be a big expense, so we’re proud to be offering our customers great value for money when they fill up with Sainsbury’s.” \nRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said the move should prompt similar moves from other retailers and could be the start of bigger falls in diesel. \nHe said: “This is welcome news for diesel drivers coming just in time for the summer holidays and it is exactly what our RAC Fuel Watch monitor has been calling for. \n“The wholesale price of diesel has been significantly lower that of petrol throughout June. We believe that there is scope for at least a five pence cut in the price of diesel which will be the first time that motorists have seen diesel cheaper than petrol at the pumps in almost fifteen years.” \nMr Williams said: “We need greater transparency and a fairer pricing model for both petrol and diesel and this is likely to spell the end of the focus on petrol prices alone.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T21:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T22:01:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
