The first thing I do is tell them how safe commercial aviation travel really is.\nGiven the expected worldwide air traffic of 33,000,000 flights, the accident rate is one fatal passenger flight accident per 4,125,000 flights, according to the Aviation Safety Network (ASN).\nBut hearing air safety Quote: s doesn’t make people feel better when they see details of a plane crash blasted across television and the Internet.\nIn ASN’s 2014 airliner accident statistics, there were a record low total of 21 fatal airliner accidents that resulted in 990 fatalities. The worst accident last year happened on July 17 when a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 (flight MH17) crashed in Ukraine, killing 298.\nThis makes 2014 the safest year ever by number of fatal accidents and the 24th safest year ever in terms of fatalities. ASN President Harro Ranter credited the low rate to continuing safety-driven efforts by international aviation organizations such as ICAO , IATA , Flight Safety Foundation and the aviation industry.\nAccording to AirSafe.com , as of December 2014, the top five aircraft models with the lowest crash rates (for models with at least two million flights) are the following:\n0.00 - the Airbus A340\n0.05 - the Embraer 170/190\n0.07 - the Boeing 747-400\n0.08 - the Airbus A320 (includes A318, A319, A321)\n0.08 - the Boeing 737-600/700/800/900\nFearOfFlying.com’s list of 20 aircraft with the lowest crash rates was slightly different.\nThe A340\nThe Boeing 777\nThe 747\nThe 737 NG\nThe 767\nOn the other side of the coin, website AirlineRatings.com found the four unsafest aircraft: the Czech-built LET410, Russia’s Antonov AN-12 and Ilyushin Il-76, and Spain’s CASA C-212. None of these aircraft are flown in the United States. And FearOfFlying.com’s bottom three in it’s top 20 list are the Tupelov Tu-154, the Ilyushin IL-76 and the Boeing 737-200.\nDespite the spate of fatal airline crashes in 2014 -- along with the blanket news coverage surrounding it -- air travel is still by far the safest mode of travel. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics , fatalities by transportation mode, from most to least safe were: large U.S. air carrier, commuter air carrier, on-demand air taxi, general aviation, railroad, recreational boating and highway.\nWith more than 30,000 flights a day taking off and landing, the odds of you experiencing an air crash are pretty slim. So book that flight and enjoy your travel.\n ", "external_links": ["http://aviation-safety.net/index.php", "http://www.fearofflying.com/resources/safest-airliners-and-airline-safety.shtml", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/W/9/L/143919964.jpg", "http://flightsafety.org/", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/9/L/143919964.jpg", "http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/no-distress-call-received-before-malaysian-777-crash-401743/", "http://www.airlineratings.com/", "http://www.airsafe.com/events/models/rate_mod.htm", "http://www.icao.int/", "http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/by_the_numbers/transportation_safety/index.html", "http://www.iata.org/"], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T04:52:14.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
