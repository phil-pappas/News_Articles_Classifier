Here are the highlights from just two of the many fall-winter 2015-16 couture collections at Paris Fashion Week, featuring the most extravagant and elaborate creations from top design houses.\nChanel's celebrity roulette\nChanel's guests were led to their seats in a giant recreated casino Tuesday inside Paris' Grand Palais — replete with roulette tables and fully-functioning gambling machines that had one Chinese fashionista addicted within minutes.\nPARIS, FRANCE - JULY 07: A model poses on the runway during the Chanel show as part of Paris Fashion Week Haute Couture Fall/Winter 2015/2016 on July 7, 2015 in Paris, France. (Getty Images Europe | Pascal Le Segretain) But the real gasps came when Kristen Stewart and a diamond-encrusted Julianne Moore walked out through an arch — both wearing bespoke Chanel couture — to take a seat around a celebrity-filled poker table in the center of the catwalk. There they hugged, chatted, gambled and laughed all through the show.\nMoore and Stewart grew close as they co-starred in \"Still Alice,\" playing mother and daughter. They both dined together in an exclusive Paris restaurant last weekend.\n\"I like people when they're gambling and well dressed like in Monte Carlo,\" said Lagerfeld.\nFellow gamblers placing bets included singers Rita Ora and Vanessa Paradis and model Lara Stone, who were there to showcase Chanel's latest jewelry collection.\nAdvertisement 3-D couture\nLagerfeld, 81, says the secret to feeling young is always looking to the future. Nothing demonstrated this better than Chanel's bright, high-tech couture show that featured Coco Chanel's famed skirt-suit jacket made via 3-D printing.\n\"I like the idea of taking the most iconic jacket of the 20th century and turning that into an object that was impossible to make when that jacket was invented,\" explained the couturier.\nA model wears a creation for Christian Dior's fall-winter 2015/2016 Haute Couture fashion collection presented in Paris, France, Monday, July 6, 2015. (AP | Kamil Zihnioglu) The quilted jackets were completely seamless and seamstress-less — created by feeding Lagerfeld's sketches into a computer program.\n\"Computers are going to enter more and more in the evolution and techniques of fashion — you cannot resist. On the contrary, if it exists in its time couture will live on,\" he said.\nA 1980s flavor lingered in the air for fall-winter in a largely black-and-white show, with oversized truncated jackets, large square shoulders, epaulettes and dramatic lapels.\nThe shoes were a standout — backless stilettos with a split tongue on the front that Lagerfeld compared to \"airplanes children make with folded paper.\"\nA model wears a creation for Christian Dior's fall-winter 2015/2016 Haute Couture fashion collection presented in Paris, France, Monday, July 6, 2015. (Kamil Zihnioglu, The Associated Press) The 67-piece-stong collection mainly played it safe, but designs frothily loosened up toward the end, with tailoring that harked to the fizz fizz years of the '20s. Feathered fringing adorned loose, long cocktail dresses, evoking the famed \"Flapper\" era.\nMeanwhile, modernized '20s \"bob\" wigs — worn in identical form by all models — also mirrored this era, giving the collection a homogenous, fem-bot feel that riffed off of the futuristic 3-D printing.\nDior celebrities hold court\nLupita Nyong'o looked ravishing in a short, cherry red Dior couture dress Monday, and was at a loss for words on entering Christian Dior's \"The Garden of Earthly Delights\" show set inside the Rodin Museum. Guests ventured with trepidation on entering the huge, abstract painted conservatory garden that featured myriad multicolored panels — and some even tripped on the giant colored fruit scattered around the floor.\n\"It's really cool,\" the actress said, looking around in amazement from her spot next to U.S. Vogue Editor Anna Wintour. \"It's so incredible. I think I need to take a moment!\"\nEmily Blunt — in a simple, white knee-length Dior gown — was equally amazed.\n\"This is just extraordinary. This is kind of why I would walk from London to Paris to see this show. I'm so excited,\" she said.\nThe only thing she regretted about her trip was a lack of sufficient planning for France's soaring temperatures, which have recently hit 104 degrees F.\n\"I mean, I fry like an egg,\" she said. \"So I'm feeling like I should have put on more sunscreen. Or a higher factor.\"\nDior's sweltering conservatory decor may well have contributed to the over-heating.\nDior time machine\nIn a surreal garden setting, Dior designer Raf Simons wove his creative needle in and out through different centuries. That produced an imaginative time-travel of a couture show, which riffed on the styles of the Flemish Masters, the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.\nThe large fruit props on the runway conjured up scenes from historic still-life oil paintings.\nLong diaphanous column silhouettes in chiffon, like medieval undergarments, floated by elegantly alongside gowns with high-cinched waists and wide, billowing sleeves that mirrored the old Flemish styles. Some bejeweled net gilets were worn on the torso, evoking chainmail in a beautiful touch.\nThe sense of chic time-travel was further heightened with delicate dots and patterns on the fabrics — designs that evoked the French Impressionists and the technique of Pointillism associated with artists like Georges Seurat.\nThe coats were the highest point of this strong collection, with one standout: a flame-red coat with beautifully large tubular cuffs.\nElsa Schiaparelli's theatrical delights\nCelebrity guests including Meg Ryan were swept away to the glamour of 1930s theatre life at Bertrand Guyon's debut collection for Schiaparelli.\nAnd what better a setting than to start exploring the theatricality of the great couturier Elsa? Famed for inventing shocking pink and having collaborations with Surrealists like Salvador Dali, Coco Chanel's hated rival Schiaparelli was one of the greatest and most colorful Parisian designers of the '20s and '30s. The house was recently revived.\nIn an impressive recreated theater, Guyon's models harked from another era. Fastidiously embellished '30s Orientalist satin jackets had softly square shoulders. Silk \"jabot\" collars and voluminous \"Duster\" coats wafted by with exaggerated pockets, alongside bejeweled eye, star and key lock decorations.\nGuyon even referenced the mania for Grecian looks in Schiaparelli's heyday in a couple of diaphanous column dresses with flashes of gold.\nNot all the theatrical exuberance worked, especially one overly clashing multicolored mink coat. But Guyon is certainly moving the house in a welcome, more coherent direction since the departure last year of designer Marco Zanini.", "external_links": ["http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/0707/20150707__d8c16ade1b3f6e1e7b0f6a7067008a5f~p1_200.jpg", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/0707/20150707__479755790~p1_200.jpg", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/0707/20150707__1849f5821b3b6e1e7b0f6a706700014e~p1_200.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-07T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T06:01:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
