The Gion festival, best known for its parade of elaborately decorated floats, is held during July. \nThe northernmost island prefecture of Hokkaido, where snow festivals are held in February, came in third with 12% voting for it, JTB said. \n\"We think there is plenty of scope for organising festival-themed tours,\" a JTB official said. \nJTB conducted the survey in Japanese from May 7 to 14 on the Internet and attracted 2,508 responses.
