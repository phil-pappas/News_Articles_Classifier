Other World Series events are planned for later this year - August in Gothenburg and then Hamilton, Bermuda in October. Up to six more are planned for 2016 including another in the Portsmouth area in July (21-24) and an additional one on Lake Michigan, Chicago.In all the races the exciting AC45F yacht will be used, by all competitors, which is for sailing what Formula 1 cars are for motor sport. We are in for fast, over 40mph, exciting challenges that can be viewed from the shoreline and in some cases no more than 50 metres from the beam of the yachts. In 2013 the final series in San Francisco between New Zealand and America was watched by over 1 million visitors to the official public sites plus hundreds of thousands more catching a free one from the city front. In tourism terms, there can be no doubt it's big business.For the 35 th Americas Cup kick off in Portsmouth the locals have teamed together with the yacht authorities and the Royal Navy to put on a spectacular event lasting over four days starting on 23rd July with the official opening ceremony followed by music (Spandau Ballet, and McBusted amongst them), aerial displays and a fan zone.Over half a million visitors are expected to attend and Portsmouth City Council have organised special park and ride facilities. In addition to this around 190 countries around the world are expected to televise the series plus, of course, millions of social media views and posts. The power of sport in tourism is difficult to overestimate and for Portsmouth (and indeed Bermuda), this is a marvellous opportunity to showcase its resurgence over the past ten years.At the recent opening of the LandRoverBAR (Land Rover and Ben Ainslie Racing) centre in the old part of the town it was obvious that from every person within the team, the determination to #bringthecuphome is top of the priority list but not far behind is the resolve to do the area and the nation proud in maximising the benefits that this sporting event can bring.Even though the Americas Cup was started in the Solent all those years ago Great Britain has never won it but perhaps in Bermuda in 2017, it will finally come back.
