PUBLISHED: 06:38, Thu, Jul 30, 2015 | UPDATED: 09:07, Thu, Jul 30, 2015 UPPERCUT PICTURES The history of airplane toilets is largely a mystery \nThankfully aircraft toilets have come a long way, so those living on a flight path don't have to worry about ducking. \nWhile airplane toilets are far from the lap of luxury, the smallest room in the sky rarely gets the coverage it deserves. \nWhether you're on a business trip to Paris or a long-haul flight down under, airplane toilets today are a necessity. \nYet the windowless, cramped cubicle was not always a feature on board an aircraft. Related articles Inside the world's most LUXURIOUS (and expensive) aeroplane seats \nThe first flight made by Orville Wright lasted just 12 seconds - hardly enough time to get a full bladder. But before long, flying became a much lengthier affair. \nYet the origins of the creation of the first airplane toilet remain a mystery, as pointed out by Aviation Global News. \n\"It is obvious that someone, somewhere, was the first person to relieve themselves in an aircraft. Who was this unitary pioneer? - history does not record,\" asked the blog. \nWhile it is unclear when pilots and passengers stopped using bottles and buckets, some interesting facts have been recorded about early aircraft toilets. GLOWIMAGES Airplane toilets have come a long way since first invented Who was this unitary pioneer? - history does not record Aviation Global News \nSecond World War pilots couldn't stand the \"slop bucket\" loos, or \"Elsans\", found on board Lancaster bombers. They often overflowed in turbulent conditions or were tricky to use. \nOne airman said: \"While we were flying in rough air, this devil's convenience often shared its contents with the floor of the aircraft, the walls, the ceiling, and sometimes a bit remained in the container itself.\" \nCrews sometimes preferred to urinate into containers, before hurling their business out of a window. \nSome apparently jettisoned waste on German targets along with their bombs. \nJames Kemper's modern vacuum toilet wasn't invented until the 1970s, with the first one installed by Boeing in 1982. \nThe vacuum sucks waste into a tank which is then stores until a plane lands. \nBefore that, plane toilets used a blue liquid that pushed the waste from the bowl into a storage tank. This liquid not only added weight to the flight, but could leak in frozen blocks over towns and cities. \nThere have been no dramatic advances in toilet technology since the vacuum, yet some airlines are trying to make toilets even smaller to cram in more customers. PHOTOGRAPHER'S CHOICE Airplane toilets are getting smaller to squeeze in more customers \nBut what does happen to all that waste if it's not jettisoned into the sky? \nPatrick Smith, who has written a book revealing air travel's secrets, said: “There is no way to jettison the contents of the lavatories during flight. \n“At the end of a flight, the blue fluid, along with your contributions to it, are vacuumed into a tank on the back of a truck. \n\"The driver then wheels around to the back of the airport and furtively offloads the waste in a ditch behind a parking lot...In truth I don’t know what he does with it. Time to start a new urban legend.” \nWhile pilots may no longer empty passengers' waste in mid-flight intentionally, they have been known to make the odd mistake. \nA man in California once won a lawsuit after pieces of \"blue ice\" fell from a plane and came crashing through the skylight of his sailboat. \nMr Smith said in his book: “A leak, extending from a toilet’s exterior nozzle fitting, caused runoff to freeze, build, and then drop like a neon ice bomb.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T08:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:03:24.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
