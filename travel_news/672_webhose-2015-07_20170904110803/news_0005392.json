The French are also staying away but to a lesser extent. This is significant because Greece is a favourite holiday destination for both the Germans and the French, and at this point Greece needs tourism more than ever. \n“Interestingly, the Chinese are still continuing to make bookings because, anecdotally at least, they perceive the cash crisis as only affecting Greeks.” \nThe fall in German bookings for the period was 49%. Bookings from the United States were down 56%, Britain 51%, Italy 51% and France 23%. \nDespite the financial crisis, so far this year arrivals to Greece are still up 7.6% on the previous year. Many people book their flights about three months ahead of travel. But the latest ForwardKeys analysis shows that travellers are starting to take fright at Greece’s deteriorating predicament. \nOlivier Jager said: “The majority of leisure travel has already been booked, which is somewhat reassuring for the Greek tourism industry. \n“But what is worrying is that the upward growth that the country was seeing has now been sharply reversed.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T12:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T18:00:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
