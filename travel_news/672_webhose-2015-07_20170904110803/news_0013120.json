Comment Posted Jul. 30, 2015 at 10:01 PM Updated at 10:01 PM Posted Jul. 30, 2015 at 10:01 PM Holland, Mich. About 20 people interested creating a watertrail in the Lake Macatawa watershed met at Park Township Hall on Thursday, July 30, to learn about how it could benefit the community, and what needs to be done. The group heard presentations on how a trail can drive tourism, how to maximize the traffic, and how to make a watertrail accessible for all ages and abilities. “A ‘Trail Town’ is a friendly place that supports and celebrates trails,” said Harry Burkholder, planning director with Land Information Access Association. Under a Great Lakes Trail Towns Planning Initiative grant, Park and Holland townships and Ottawa County are working with seven other municipalities to make trail connections along the Lake Michigan coastline, which should result in a string of “Trail Towns.” The Land Information Access Association, a nonprofit service organization based in Traverse City, along with Access Recreation Group LLC are leading the municipalities toward becoming “Trail Towns.” Bicycle tourism alone brings $668 million to Michigan annually, according to the Michigan Department of Transportation. Data is not readily available on the impact of kayaking and other watertrail sports. Some of the biggest considerations when creating a trail that drives tourism are amenities, signage and connectivity with the downtown and businesses, Burkholder said. Trails begin with a trailhead, which should have a variety of onsite amenities, such as restrooms, water, benches, picnic tables, shelter, signs, vending machines, bike or kayak racks and trail maps, he said. There’s also a portal, which welcomes trail users into a community when they leave the trail, Burkholder said. A pathway then gets users from the portal to the central business area. The gateway is the entrance into the business district. The center is the downtown business area. Along the way, there should be points of interest that celebrate the community’s unique identity and history or provide specialized services, these can include businesses. To get all those things done, the community needs to organize, and recruit partners that have a stake in the trail system, Burkholder said. Designing and promoting the trail are also important, and then businesses need to be restructured to cater to the trail and trail users. One example of making businesses trail-friendly would be making the side of a business that faces the water — usually considered the back — seem to be the front, including an entrance, he said. Trails can also be used to draw in new business to cater to trail users’ unique needs, Burkholder said. Another important aspect is to make sure everyone can use the trail. Cindy Burkhour, of Access Recreation Group, said that universally accessible amenities aren’t just for people with disabilities, but also can make a trail experience more enjoyable for everyone.

They are convenient for anyone who is new to kayaking, canoeing or paddleboarding; families; elderly; and anyone who doesn’t want to get their feet wet. Other considerations are creating navigable routes with rollable surfaces, accessible restrooms, kiosk information in accessible areas and formats, parking and more. John Scholtz, director of Ottawa County Parks and Recreation Commission, pointed out three to four sites along Lake Macatawa and its watershed that could be home to accessible kayak launches. Discussions with communities will continue for the next several months, and culminate in public hearings for community feedback, he said. Community assessments will begin today, July 31, to determine potential routes, trailheads, accessibility and other challenges and opportunities. Meetings and planning will be ongoing throughout the next few months. The goal is to have plans finished by Decemeber, Burkholder said. The project is funded by Michigan’s Coastal Zone Management Program, which aims to build on and expand the recommendations of the Lake Michigan Water Trail Plan completed in 2014. — Follow this reporter on Twitter @SentinelJustine .
