But Ciudad Juárez's murder tally has long since plummeted from the astronomical high of more than 3,000 recorded in 2010. In 2014, 424 or 538 people were reported killed in Juárez (depending on what entity is doing the reporting). Per capita, even that higher number represents a murder rate similar to that of Detroit or New Orleans . The border city nonetheless remains forbidden territory for Americans who in prior decades would cross over from El Paso in droves to visit family, bars, restaurants, dentists, pharmacies and strip clubs. Juárez is by no means a paragon of security, but it’s certainly safe enough to grab dinner.\n\"Before, a lot of businesses were closing because they were losing money,\" says Ángel, 58, a Juárez native trying to lure passersby into a downtown pharmacy. He wants tourists to return. \"I think that many [people] still don't have much confidence, but things are now good here in Juárez … There's a lot of security.\"\nThat's not, however, an easy message to convey after years of brutality. \"The reputation that was given to Juárez worldwide was really bad,\" says Ángel.\nThe drug war, which raged so intensely between 2008 and 2012, made customers, both foreign and domestic, scarce. Meanwhile, criminal gangs took advantage of the impunity to extort local merchants citywide—even small operations like the Juárez Avenue stall, just a short walk across the border, from which Jorge Hernandez, 47, sells melon and pineapple aguas frescas. All while the global economy slid into crisis. Merchants were squeezed from all sides.\nRecently, a “Be Proud to be from Juárez” advertising campaign launched, touting the city as just as beautiful as New York or Paris. \"There weren't [any tourists],\" says Hernandez. \"They stopped coming when the killings and everything began.\" The streets were empty, and \"people went inside early… Now, more people are beginning to come on Fridays, on Saturdays, to dance… and to drink. But before, no. The youth didn't come out.\"\nNoé, 35, a taxi driver waiting downtown, is not optimistic that things will return to normal.\n\"It was full of people,\" says Noé. \"There was a lot of work and everything. Right now, there is nothing.\"\nToday, Juarenses pack the downtown market and take in, or at least tolerate, a preacher's amplified voice ringing out across the plaza in front of the Cathedral of Our Lady of Guadalupe. But the return of once-ubiquitous American visitors has been slow to nonexistent.\nNoé says that outsiders need time to regain their confidence in Juárez. But the same also goes for Juarenses. The drug wars shattered many of the already fragile social bonds in a city reconstructed upon a maquiladora economy that entailed rapid population growth and massive urban sprawl. There are plans for a convention center , and to attract more of the medical tourism that for Mexican border cities has been a competitive advantage. But many of the city's newest development efforts appear in large part geared toward increasing civic self-esteem and local commerce.\nRedevelopment projects underway include a major remodeling of downtown buildings, and the construction of amenities to support pedestrians and cyclists (there are precious few of the latter) by closing streets to vehicular traffic , restricting parking , widening sidewalks and adding bike routes . Recently, a \"Be Proud to be from Juárez\" advertising campaign launched, touting the city as just as beautiful as New York or Paris , and as the birthplace of the margarita and the burrito (both claims are disputed). And the city is building a new Noa Noa , the long-since shuttered nightclub where singer Juan Gabriel began his career. A fresh mural downtown features a portrait of the dazzling Divo de Juárez, with the Quote: : \"Congratulations to all the people who are proud to be who they are.\"\nEfforts to change the city's image also represent a form of denial on the part of local elites, says the social scientist Hector Antonio Padilla Delgado of the Autonomous University of Ciudad Juárez . He dates that effort to the 1990s, when civil society groups loudly protested the infamous and unsolved killing of women in the city. It's almost as if to say \"that what you see is not true,\" says Padilla. \"It denies, minimizes and excessively plays down the questions relating to the lack of public safety. I agree that violence isn't everything. But you can't deny it either.\"\nFor many El Pasoans, the vast majority of whom are Hispanic , a one-time casual lunch destination remains off limits. Pedestrian crossings recorded by the U.S. at El Paso ports of entry decreased from 8,454,434 in 2007 to 6,015,421 in 2013. More dramatically, personal vehicle passengers dropped from 29,180,824 in 2005 to 14,940,566 in 2011. But it was American national security politics and anti-immigrant sentiment that walled Juárez off from its American neighbor well before the cartel wars went into overdrive.\n\"Look, Juárez Avenue began to decline, more or less, before the violence came about,\" says Carlos Velasquez, 47, a longtime bartender at downtown's venerable Kentucky Club. \"It was since September 11, when the towers fell over there, that they closed the bridges, and the obstacles. It was then that Juárez Avenue began to fall… And what happened is that, after 2007, it was just finished. Everything.\"\n“You drive over there, it’s a nightmare getting back.” In 2000, before the response to the September 11, 2001, attacks created permanently long lines of cars, 48,420,274 vehicular passengers crossed. Americans could cross back into the U.S. with just a driver’s license. Now, a passport is required.\n\"You drive over there, it's a nightmare getting back,\" says Howard Campbell, a professor of anthropology at the University of Texas at El Paso. Often, \"it takes an hour or two… The inconvenience factor combined with the perception of danger and fear is just impossible to overcome.\"\nRight around the same time that free trade eased the crossborder movement of capital and goods, Washington politicians increasingly restricted the passage of individual people. In 1993, the year before NAFTA went into effect, the Border Patrol implemented Operation Hold the Line in El Paso, flooding the Rio Grande with agents. Before Hold the Line, Juárez residents crossed back and forth, with or without authorization, on a daily basis. That operation, and the nonstop hike in border militarization that has prevailed since, has forced undocumented immigration into the hands of smugglers crossing in the dangerous desert heat. Ironically, it also effectively locked many undocumented immigrants on the U.S. side of the border who might otherwise prefer to live in Juárez and work in El Paso.\nThe violence that spiked from 2008 to 2012 was just the latest blow to a city undergoing a long transition from desert bacchanal into low-wage factory town. El Paso and Juárez were twin cities with more in common than not. Today, they can feel painfully distant.\n© Provided by The Atlantic Cities \"There's not a lot of comprehension or confidence among El Pasoans that it's okay and safe to cross into Juárez,\" says Chris Lopez, the former editor of the El Paso Times and a current consultant for the Juárez newspaper Periódico Norte. \"El Pasoans in particular are not crossing over, and really not anywhere close to what they were doing prior to 2008.\"\nPeople often tell Lopez, \"you're crazy. It's not safe there. And I can talk until I'm blue in the face… but they're not convinced.\"\nCampbell says he has failed to sell friends on the excellent one-dollar haircuts he gets across the river.\n\"Juárez is not Acapulco,\" says Campbell, an expert on the border and its drug wars. \"It doesn't have natural beauty, exactly. If… your appeal is more subtle, and you have one of the most violent situations in the world going on, how do you overcome that?\"", "external_links": ["http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fAAcqXK7%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fAAcr5kC.img&description=Provided+by+The+Atlantic+Cities", "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/wayne-county/2015/01/01/detroit-homicides/21153429/", "http://www.theatlantic.com/", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http:%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fAAcqXK7%3focid%3dsp&media=http:%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fAAcqROy.img&description=Ju%C3%A1rez+to+Tourists:+It&#39;s+Safe+to+Come+Back+Now+-+Provided+by+The+Atlantic+Cities", "https://vimeo.com/130155641?from=outro-local", "http://netnoticias.mx/2015-06-10-982d65df/reportaje-jurez-no-est-preparado-para-los-que-usan-bicicletas-ciclistas/", "https://vimeo.com/126935996", "http://transborder.bts.gov/programs/international/transborder/TBDR_BC/TBDR_BCQ.html", "http://diario.mx/Local/2015-04-27_cc0efffc/colocan-senalamientos-de-no-estacionarse-en-la-juarez/", "http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_27976799/mexican-consul-doctors-unveil-juarez-medical-tourism-initiative", "http://nortedigital.mx/buscan-detonar-uso-de-la-bici/", "http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_27352426/juarez-is-worlds-27th-most-violent-city", "http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2015/02/21/espectaculos/a09n1esp", "http://nortedigital.mx/la-nueva-avenida-juarez-estara-lista-en-diciembre/", "http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_25839102/juarez-master-plan-include-downtown-overhaul", "http://www.seguridadjusticiaypaz.org.mx/sala-de-prensa/1165-por-cuarto-ano-consecutivo-san-pedro-sula-es-la-ciudad-mas-violenta-del-mundo", "http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_24203738/operation-hold-line-has-done-more-harm-than", "http://www.elpasotimes.com/ci_17418626", "https://vimeo.com/120992194", "http://diario.mx/Local/2015-01-22_0bc31afd/obras-transforman-rostro-del-centro/", "http://diario.mx/Estado/2015-01-22_3ffbe286/centro-de-convenciones-en-la-frontera-estara-listo-en-un-ano/", "http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2015/01/new_orleans_murders_fall_again.html"], "published": "2015-07-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T21:26:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
