However, the business, aviation and travel sectors must be realistic about progress,” the organisation said in a statement. \n\"While ITM believes a third runway at Heathrow is top priority for the UK economy... a second runway is also needed at Gatwick, and investment must be made to improve capacity at other airports in the south and across the regions. \n“If the UK wants to remain competitive on the international stage expanding our main hub at Heathrow is fundamental.\" \n‘Build consensus’ \nBoth BAR UK (Board of Airline Representatives) and ABTA support the announcement but said the government must act quickly upon the recommendations and not let political figures delay progress. \nDale Keller, chief executive of BAR UK said: “The Government now needs to evaluate the independent findings of the Airports Commission and to expediently act upon their recommendations. \n“Now is the time for everyone, including politicians of all parties, to pull together in the national interest and support the bold plans to expand and improve airport infrastructure at Heathrow,” he said. \nABTA CEO Mark Tanzer said: “Today’s announcement is the first step towards the delivery of urgently needed capacity at the UK’s hub airport and we now look forward to the Government’s response. \n“We call on Government to work across party boundaries and create a robust political consensus which will deliver this recommendation for UK businesses, and passengers. ABTA will be working with the Government, as well as the opposition front benches to help build consensus.” \n‘Catastrophic’ \nThe government has said it will take time to study the report before making a final decision which is expected in the autumn. The British Air Transport Association ( BATA ) said although the government response should not be rushed additional capacity is “urgently needed”. \n“Our priority is to ensure that the final scheme is cost effective, offers value for money for airport customers, and does not rely on today’s passengers paying now for infrastructure that wouldn’t be ready until the mid-2020s,” said BATA CEO Nathan Stower. \n“Airlines will work with Government to ensure that their decision meets the needs of passengers and cargo customers.” \nLondon mayor Boris Johnson has told The BBC that a new runway at Heathrow would have a “catastrophic” effect on the city. \"This is the sort of thing you could have got away with in China in the 1950s,\" he said, adding that the impact in terms of the environment and noise would be \"so huge\" that it was \"not deliverable\". \nMP Zac Goldsmith said he stands by his pledge to resign if expansion at Heathrow goes ahead. \"A decision in favour of Heathrow expansion is really just a decision in favour of delay and fudge,\" he added. \nThe Commission said that a second runway at Gatwick was a \"credible\" option but was less able to provide connections to long-haul destinations and would create lower levels of economic growth. \nA third option for extending the runways at Heathrow was rejected.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T12:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T14:11:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
