However, CIMAR projections indicate that a new stronger swell likely will enter the country next Thursday.\nThis phenomenon would bring waves up to 2.4 meters (7.8 feet) high, with strong breaks every 21 seconds Lizano reported.\nThis week CIMAR released a new application for mobile phones and devices that offers updated information on Costa Rica’s sea conditions along both Caribbean and Pacific shores, as well as around Cocos Island.", "external_links": ["http://www.ucr.ac.cr/", "http://miocimar.ucr.ac.cr/"], "published": "2015-07-18T06:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T08:16:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
