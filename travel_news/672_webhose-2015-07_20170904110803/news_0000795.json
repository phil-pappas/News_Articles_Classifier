(AP) â€” Taylor Swift was a true all-American girl at her concert Friday night as she honored the U.S. women's soccer team by bringing them onstage.\nFresh off their World Cup championship, the players joined Swift during \"Style\" at the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Four of the players are from New Jersey.\nThe players brought their trophy and let Swift hold it. They waved two large American flags, and the crowd chanted \"U.S.A.\" after they exited. Model Heidi Klum also was onstage during the song.\nThe U.S. returned to the top of the FIFA women's rankings after winning the World Cup. The U.S. toppled Germany before beating Japan 5-2 in Sunday's final in Vancouver to collect the top prize in women's soccer for the first time in 16 years.\nMusician Shawn Mendes performs during Taylor Swift's \"1989\" tour at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford on Friday, July 10, 2015, in New Jersey.
