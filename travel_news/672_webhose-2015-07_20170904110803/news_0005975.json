He said he funneled money to one of the women he had sex with through his agent so his wife wouldn't find out.\nCosby's publicist, David Brokaw, did not immediately return a message seeking comment late Saturday.\nAlthough Constand never sought any money from Cosby, the comedian said he figured his wife would have known he was helping her with furthering her education but said, \"My wife would not know it was because Andrea and I had had sex,\" according to the newspaper.\nAdvertisement Constand's case was settled on confidential terms.\nCosby has denied accusations made by dozens of women who claim he sexually assaulted them. He has never been charged with a crime, but the accusations have shattered Cosby's good-guy, fatherly image.\nAt points during the deposition, Cosby also described his sexual encounters with the women in detail.\nThe deposition also paints Cosby as emotionally charming, but he also spoke about disregarding relationships to pursue other women.\nHe suggested he was skilled at understanding women and nonverbal cues signaling sexual consent.\nCosby, who has been married since 1964, said he sparked a relationship with Constand in the early 2000s and invited her to his house and had conversations about her family and plans for future education.\nThe relationship between the two continued for several years until, Constand says, Cosby drugged and molested her in his Pennsylvania home.\nCosby said during the deposition that Constand was \"a liar.\"\nAlthough Cosby pained himself as sensitive to Constand, he told her attorney, \"I think Andrea is a liar and I know she's a liar because I was there,\" when he was asked how he felt about Constand crying during her deposition in the case.\nBruce Castor, the suburban Pennsylvania prosecutor who declined to bring charges in the Constand case a decade ago, told the AP earlier this month that if he is elected again he would review the unsealed court documents to see if Cosby committed perjury.\nThe Associated Press generally does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they agree to have their names published, as Constand has done.", "external_links": ["http://nyti.ms/1CPjldP)"], "published": "2015-07-18T16:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T09:46:37.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
