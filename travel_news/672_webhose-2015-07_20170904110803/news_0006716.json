But let’s be honest: There are times when it’s more expedient — and just easier — to consume a beer instead of asking for a G&T.\nThat’s when you turn to Flying Dog’s Juniper White IPA, the newest member of its limited-edition Brewhouse Rarities series.\nThe beer was born during the brewery’s annual retreat at Catoctin­ Mountain, where any employee can pitch a concept to brew master Matt Brophy. The idea for Juniper White IPA came from brewery packaging supervisor Matt Hardesty, a great fan of gin and tonics, who suggested replacing a white IPA’s coriander and orange notes with juniper and lime zest to create a beer more akin to his favorite summer mixed drink.\n[ Why DC’s ‘gray market’ is a good thing for beer lovers ]\nThe nose promises juniper and lime zest; the body delivers juniper, pine and grapefruit, with a hint of other citrus. There’s a very dry, almost prickly finish. It’s a very refreshing beer, despite the 6.5 percent ABV.\nIt’s not a direct replacement for a G&T, and it won’t protect you from malaria, but it’s an option beer and cocktail lovers alike can reach for when temperatures climb.\nAs with all other Brewhouse Rarities, such as Sriracha Pale Ale and Mango Habanero IPA, Juniper White IPA will be available for only a limited time. It was officially released on July 15, and Flying Dog director of communications Erin Weston said she expects it to be on taps and shelves until “September 1 at the latest.”\n— Fritz Hahn\nFlying Dog Brewery: www.flyingdogbrewery.com . Six-packs available throughout the Mid-Atlantic region for $9.99 to $11.99. Also found on tap in area bars and sold in growlers at the brewery, in Frederick.\n(Deb Lindsey/For The Washington Post)\nMore from Food :\nBeer of the Week: Port City Derecho Common\nBeer of the Week: Clown Shoes Clementine", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T14:21:31.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
