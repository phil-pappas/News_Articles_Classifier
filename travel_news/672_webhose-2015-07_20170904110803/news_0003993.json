Designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, the Tor Vergata complex was meant to host events for the 2009 swimming world championships — before the entire event was moved to the Foro Italico.\nFor several years, the Tor Vergata complex has stood in a state of abandonment.\n\"We will not build cathedrals in the desert,\" Marino said. \"We are not going to overbuild. We are going to develop what already exists.\"\nRome does need to build a velodrome and a rowing venue.\nThe delegation also included Italian cabinet undersecretary Claudio de Vincenti and Rome bid committee general director Claudia Bugno.\nHamburg, Boston, Paris and Budapest have also announced bids for 2024. The IOC will select the host city in 2017.\nIn her technical presentation to the IOC, Bugno emphasized a bid funded by the public as well as national and international private investments.\nRome is considering a budget of 6 billion euros ($6.6 billion) — $2 billion of which would be covered by the IOC — or roughly half of what London spent in 2012.\n\"As with the 1960 Games, which transformed Rome and the Olympic movement, we are looking to launch short and medium term initiatives which will leave a legacy for the city, even in the next two years,\" Bugno said.\nThree years ago, then-premier Mario Monti scrapped Rome's plans to bid for the 2020 Games because of financial concerns. The new bid comes with Italy's economy still stagnant and with new revelations surfacing in a widening corruption scandal in Rome that has been labeled \"Mafia Capital.\"\nPhone conversations intercepted by police and published in the media have described how local criminal bosses managed to cement ties with city politicians over lucrative public contracts.\nDozens have been arrested and Rome's deputy mayor resigned this week, even though he is not formally under investigation.\n\"If a state renounces a big event because there is a risk of corruption and criminality, that's a defeat by itself,\" said Italy's anti-corruption czar Raffaele Cantone earlier this week. Cantone is slated to assume a role in the bid team.\n___\nThis story corrects detail on when the Foro Italico was built.\n___\nAP Sports Writer Andrew Dampf in Rome contributed.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T17:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T02:09:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
