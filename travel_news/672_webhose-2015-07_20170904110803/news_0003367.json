Thome, eTN Africa Correspondent | Jul 19, 2015 Adv: \nWhen Kenya Airways’ new website went ‘live’ again were a great many ‘wow’ emerging from users, as the Pride of Africa turned the site’s focus sharply towards their customers. \nThe recently launched scheme called ‘Hot Deals’ now shows users of the website, once they have identified their country of origin within the Kenya Airways’ network, the best deals available. \nA ticket from Entebbe to the paradise islands of the Seychelles now goes for as little as US Dollars 486 while a trip to Vietnam has a return ticket price start from US Dollars 1030 and those keen to pay a visit to Malawi only need US Dollar 498 to get to Malawi. \nNavigation of the new site, through highlighted links to key functions like online bookings, online check in, booking changes or KQ’s frequent flyer programme ‘Flying Blue’ has just become easier and other services are easily found by moving the cursor over the topics on the top of the site. \nSmartphone, Phablet and Tablet users of course also have the option to download the Kenya Airways Mobile App and access all these services on their hand held devices. \nTwo more Boeing B787-8 Dreamliners will be joining the fleet over the next couple of weeks as will another brand new Boeing B737-800NG SkyInterior, which features a state of the art lighting experience throughout the cabin and the new business class seats which Kenya Airways has introduced in the more recently acquired -800NG’s.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T07:27:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
