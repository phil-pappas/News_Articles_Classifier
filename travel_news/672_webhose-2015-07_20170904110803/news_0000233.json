In line with the current daily service the second daily wide-bodied flight will offer passengers the highest standards of passenger comfort, with luxurious private suites in First Class, lie-flat beds in Business Class and generously-sized Economy Class seats.\n“In the last three years our flights to Lisbon have gone from strength to strength both on the passenger and cargo side. There is clearly a need for another daily service to satisfy this demand, which is why we will start a second daily flight from 1st January 2016,” said Hubert Frach, Emirates’ Divisional Senior Vice President Commercial Operations West.\n“The additional service will provide customers in Africa, the Far East and Australasia, the Middle East and West Asia with even easier access to Lisbon, supporting the burgeoning business and leisure traffic between these markets and Portugal,” he continued. “This is coupled with an unparalleled experience in the air with on-board features like ice, our award-winning inflight entertainment system, world-class service and gourmet cuisine.”\nAs one of Europe’s warmest countries and boasting over 800 kilometres of Atlantic coast, medieval castles and scenic villages, Portugal continues to see strong growth across its tourism sector. In particular, visitor numbers from across the Far East continue to grow with China, Japan and Korea earmarked by the country’s tourism board, Visit Portugal, as being key markets for growth.\n“We continue to work closely with Visit Portugal to ensure a coordinated and sustained approach to attracting inbound tourism numbers to Portugal. Given our broad global network and convenient one-stop connection through Dubai we are confident that this second daily flight will help boost visitor numbers to Portugal even further,” add Mr Frach.\nThe growth in services to Lisbon by Emirates follows the recent announcement of the airline as shirt sponsor for the city’s Benfica Football team until the end of the 2017/18 season, underscoring the airline’s commitment to Portugal.\nThe new flight, operated by a Boeing 777-300ER will offer eight First Class Suites, 42 lie-flat Business Class seats and 310 spacious Economy Class seats. EK 193 leaves Dubai at 1440hrs each day and arrives in Lisbon at 1920hrs. The return flight, EK 194 departs Lisbon at 2100hrs and gets into Dubai at 0845hrs the next day.\nEmirates currently flies to 37 cities across Europe, offering more than 65 flights per day across the continent.\nSource:- Emirates", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T13:53:29.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
