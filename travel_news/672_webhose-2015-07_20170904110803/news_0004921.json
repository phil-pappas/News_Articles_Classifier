The comment period closes August 17, 2015 . \nAnnual seasonal flooding of the NPS-managed road from milepost seven to eight has resulted in temporary road closures, public safety concerns, as well as road deterioration. Therefore, the National Park Service, in cooperation with the Federal Highway Administration, is proposing to raise the Herman Leirer Road five feet west of the Resurrection River Bridge. \nThe construction project would include four box culverts, five feet tall and six feet wide each, to allow more water to flow under the road to help maintain wetlands and the floodplain. The travel lanes would remain 12 feet wide. The paved shoulders would increase to three feet wide for bicycle and pedestrian safety. The existing temporary jersey barriers would be removed. Construction activity would occur from spring to fall 2016 during the day, with flaggers, some short delays, and one-lane traffic. A few temporary road closures would take place at night and in the early morning hours for culvert installation. \nThe EA can be viewed at http://parkplanning.nps.gov/projectHome.cfm?projectID=54877.
