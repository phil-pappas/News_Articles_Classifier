One question we’re told will be put forward is whether Rudolph was “on the clock” during his alleged meeting with Sam and Mark Kavanagh . Let’s not forget whatever money the ATC has is industry money. It is a non-profit organisation where surplus funds are expected to be put back into the industry. Trainer Sam Kavanagh. Source: News Corp Australia\nThe matter of whether we pay for Rudolph’s legal fees is just one of a number of sticky questions yet to be answered.\nHow did Rudolph know Kavanagh had given evidence against Brennan before the rest of us did?\nDay one of Kavanagh’s hearing was conducted at Racing NSW headquarters on June 9. The racing public was informed the Rosehill trainer had been charged with cobalt use on March 10.\nYet the meeting between Rudolph and the Kavanaghs took place at the Lord Dudley Hotel on March 2, eight days before public knowledge of an elevated cobalt reading.\nThere’s been no suggestion Rudolph was pressuring Mark Kavanagh. so what was the Victorian doing there?\nAnd who remembers Murray Conallin ? A genuine bloke that was found guilty of placing 71 bets over a 20-month period while being employed by the ATC as a photo finish judge.\nNone of the bets were found to have interfered with any decision Conallin made but, because he was in breach of the rules, the stewards had little option but to take action.\nHe was stood down and, following an inquiry, wasn’t allowed to set foot on racetracks in NSW for 18 months.\nWe asked deputy NSW Premier and Minister of Racing Troy Grant what he thought of the latest twist in the cobalt saga.\n“I have full confidence in Racing NSW to handle this matter appropriately,” Grant said.\n■ ■ ■\nSTILL on cobalt, Darren Smith has his appeal against charges heard tomorrow at Racing NSW offices.\nSmith maintains, because there was no threshold when he used cobalt, he’s not in breach of any rule.\nHe had to wait 10 months before any charges were laid yet during that time he wasn’t allowed to nominate, accept or trial any horse essentially removing him of his livelihood.\nFEMALE RIDERS HOLD THEIR OWN\nIN how many sports do we see men and women compete against each other on a level playing field?\nSerena Williams makes millions a year because she competes against members of her own sex. If the world No. 1 had to play the likes of Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer , she’d be lucky to get one tenth of that.\nBut in racing we make our girls ride against the boys — and without concession. At The Track watched as four of the 16 races at the Grafton carnival were won by female riders giving the fairer sex a 25 per cent strike rate despite only making up less than 10 per cent of the jockeys’ room.\nWinona Costin is Sydney’s champion apprentice. We’ve seen her outmuscle one of the toughest around in Jimmy Cassidy and she’s more than aware of the lanes we’ve seen on Sydney tracks over the past few months.\nLinda Meech is the only female to win a Group 1 race (Coolmore Classic on Plucky Belle ) this season.\nAre we underestimating our female riders when it comes to getting the job done in the big ones?\nThe Group 1 races are where the top jockeys bag the cash. Many jockeys maintain they should be allowed to wear sponsored paraphernalia (within reason). It would certainly assist the women in bridging the income gap.

Pat Webster has obviously got this one in the zone and he’ll be winning more races again soon.\nOriginally published as Will ATC pay legal fees?", "external_links": ["http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227438/286506-83ed3b18-27aa-11e5-b424-466486ab9bda.jpg", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/superracing/att-will-australian-turf-club-pay-legal-fees-for-official-matt-rudolph-in-cobalt-case/story-fni2gg7e-1227438285865", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227438/286592-2271f36e-27ab-11e5-b424-466486ab9bda.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-12T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T13:31:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
