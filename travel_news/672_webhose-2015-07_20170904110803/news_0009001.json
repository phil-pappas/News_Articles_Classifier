This deployment is part of the Airbus initiative to actively promote the deployment of PBN procedures in the region for the benefit of the industry, which brings greater assurance to the safety equation and reduces flight crew workload. The key success factor will be to involve all the stakeholders and start with the regulatory implementation requirements. To achieve this, a specific national workshop was held and opened to any operator interested in RNP operations. The deployment phase will be pursued through a collaborative process, taking into consideration both SENEAM Air Traffic Controllers and Volaris pilots design requirements. \nThe project also encompasses a tailored training for SENEAM Air Traffic Controllers in order to increase confidence and knowledge about mixing conventional and PBN traffic. The DGAC requires operators to deliver an operational approval dossier and qualify their pilots for RNP-AR operations. Airbus ProSky will support Volaris in defining and performing the training programme through a \"train the trainer\" plan. \nEnrique Beltranena, Volaris Chief Executive Officer stated, \"International airports like Tijuana and Guadalajara are facing major traffic growth, which requires the implementation of new airspaces based on the PBN concept in order to cope with the growth. The project will be managed in close collaboration with the DGAC of Mexico and SENEAM as having those entities working together with us guarantees that the programme will be a great success not only for Volaris but also for any qualified operator with service to those airports. In addition, fuel efficient procedures mean less CO2 emissions, resulting in environmental benefits.\" \nRafael Alonso-Nivez, Airbus ProSky Regional Director added, \"The deployment of PBN procedures at key mid-size airports in Mexico is a great step forward in implementing efficient and modern airspace concepts in the country. The procedures to be delivered should offer several operational benefits to Airlines including better minima and shorter trajectories. In addition, the Air Traffic Controllers benefit - by reducing workload thanks to anticipated pre-defined aircraft path and less radio communication. The procedures will be therefore made fully available for any qualified operator as the aim of those procedures is to benefit to the whole Mexican aeronautical industry.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T21:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T22:02:00.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
