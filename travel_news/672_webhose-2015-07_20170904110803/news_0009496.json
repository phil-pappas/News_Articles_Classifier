But while losing your hair can provide a rich seam of material for comedians, men in other professions go to great lengths to reverse the steady march of male-pattern baldness. None more so than sportsmen. Some, such as Manchester United’s Wayne Rooney, have openly admitted to having had work done. And just this week, Scottish international Kris Boyd released photos taken while having 1,762 hair grafts implanted into his head at The Glasgow Clinic. Kilmarnock striker Kris Boyd (Photo: PA) Today, photos have emerged of Steve Claridge, alumnus of Leicester City, Crystal Palace, Millwall and Gosport Borough, among 417 other football clubs, boasting one of the more unusual haircuts of the summer. After being photographed at Dorchester Town’s ground, the Match of the Day and BBC 5Live pundit has unwittingly generated rumours that he too has undergone some sort of hair transplantation procedure. Though he is yet to confirm or deny the rumours, if Claridge, 49, has had treatment he will merely be the latest in a long line of footballers to lay the follicular equivalent of artificial turf.

Cricket in particular boasts a number of out-and-proud hair-restoration veterans, from Phil Tufnell and Graham Gooch to Shane Warne and Michael Vaughan.

But perhaps the most extreme - and honest - example of a sportsman going to great lengths to preserve his hirsute image is Andre Agassi, who admitted that his trademark bandana-and-lion’s-mane hairdo of the early Nineties was, in fact, a wig. Arguably braver still was the tennis ace’s decision to unveil his bald head to the world. After all, as shiny-headed comedian Larry David points out, “Anyone can be confident with a full head of hair. But a confident bald man - there's your diamond in the rough.” Follow @TelegraphMen", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T00:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T00:45:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
