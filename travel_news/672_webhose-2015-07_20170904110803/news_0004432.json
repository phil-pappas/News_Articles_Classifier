The hotel has recently completed an enhancement to its wireless infrastructure by adding a total of 100 access points to cover all of its guest rooms, restaurants, recreational areas and lobby. This is however, only phase one of the project, which will see an upgrade of all the internet access points to a newer model in 2016 - the latest in the wireless world. \nThe hotel has also recently completed a study of its guests’ internet usage, which uncovered that over 71% of guests utilize more than two mobile devices requiring an internet connection in a double occupied room. To cope with this increased need for connectivity, Amwaj Rotana has upgraded the guest internet line to more than double its previous speed. “The most prominent change in guest behaviour in recent years has undoubtedly been with regards to technology, and we believed that as a five star hotel, we need to keep aligned with our guests’ changing expectations and the latest trends,” shares Rabih Merhy, Director of I.T. at Amwaj Rotana. The next project due to be completed in the early part of 2016 will be the installation of larger TV sets and the implementation of a fully interactive system where guests can easily satiate their needs at the touch of a button.
