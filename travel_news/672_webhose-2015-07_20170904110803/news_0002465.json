As temperatures in London and the south hovered around the 40˚C mark, staff from Sodexo Prestige provided everything from fine dining to afternoon tea for visitors to the Henley Royal Regatta. This year’s regatta was one of the largest in the event’s 175 year history with Sodexo providing catering at Henley’s riverside hospitality village at Fawley Meadows and at Temple Island. \nThe island – which featured in the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics, also catered for by Sodexo – provided a picturesque setting for a variety of VIP hospitality packages, along with a focal point for river cruises giving guests the best possible view of the sporting action. This is the second consecutive year in which Sodexo Prestige has been the lead caterer and hospitality provider for the five day event and Sodexo’s Venue and Events Marketing Manager Natasha Carr, said: «It is not only one of the most prestigious events in the sporting and social calendar but also one of the loveliest. The setting at Fawley Meadows is superb and there is always a fantastic atmosphere – a great event to entertain clients or friends and family in true British style.” Along with Henley Royal Regatta, Sodexo Prestige catered for a number of key summer social events, including RHS Chelsea and Hampton Court Palace Flower Shows, Royal Ascot and The Open.
