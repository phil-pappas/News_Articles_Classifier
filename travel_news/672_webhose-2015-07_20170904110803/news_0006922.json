These solutions can empower travel buyers to create cost-saving strategies and more effective travel programs.\nARC will introduce a new service that provides economically priced airport pair market reports delivered on demand within 48 hours. The reports are based on information from ARC’s industry-leading data warehouse and will feature individual airport pairs chosen by the customer. Each report will include 16 charts with key metrics that uncover trends and cost saving opportunities within the customer’s top chosen routes. Metrics include airfares, cabin class, length of stay, carrier capacity, and performance by airline.\nARC will also preview an enhanced version of FareSight, the business intelligence tool designed to help corporate travel buyers optimize their air travel policies using current and historic ARC data, allowing them to benchmark spend and policy metrics directly related to their individual organization.\nDemonstrations of both the new report and enhanced FareSight will take place at ARC’s booth (#551) during exhibition hours.\nARC’s data repository houses air-ticket itineraries and fares from more than 240 countries, 3,500 airports, and 350 airlines worldwide. The data warehouse currently contains more than four billion ticket transactions, which represent 900,000 different origin and destination markets (airport pairs).\nARC will also participate in GBTA’s Media Day, an event for media representatives attending the convention. The company’s 15-minute briefing will begin at 9 a.m. on Sunday, July 26 in room 206A in the Orange County Convention Center.\nAdditionally, ARC is hosting an exclusive after-party for GBTA attendees with co-sponsors Diio, tClara, and UATP on Monday, July 27 from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. at the Blue Martini Lounge in Pointe Orlando. To receive an invitation to the party, attendees should visit ARC’s exhibit booth (#551).\nTags: ARC , GBTA Convention", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T09:15:57.606+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
