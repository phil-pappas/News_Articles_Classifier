One of the highlights of the property will be the restaurant and bars on the 21st floor, offering panoramic views across the city. \n\n\"Seoul is one of the biggest destinations for Japanese travellers and we believe it has a lot of potential,\" Masatori Katoh, assistant manager of the company’s hotel management headquarters, told T TG Asia e-Daily . \n\n\"We aim to appeal to female Japanese tourists by offering five-star rooms and facilities at a four-star price,\" he said. \"We also require all our staff to be able to speak Japanese.\" \n\nNishi-Nippon Railroad is embarking on a gradual expansion abroad, with its second overseas property scheduled to open in Bangkok in 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T11:41:54.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
