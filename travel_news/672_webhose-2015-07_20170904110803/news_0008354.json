The Drone Show is the UK’s only public exhibition dedicated to the safe use of drone and UAV technology. On December 5th and 6th, Birmingham’s NEC Arena will see the CAA take centre stage, discussing UAV and drone regulations with commercial and consumer customers alike for the first time. \nThe regulator is expected to outline current thinking on how oversight of the rapidly expanding UAV sector will evolve over the short to medium term. As well as addressing issues such as misuse and dangerous flying by recreational users, Ofcom will also be announcing the very latest reports from the regulatory body. Other selected speakers will include Gerry Corbett, UAS Programme Lead for the CAA, Philip Heath a senior partner from CoverDrone Insurance, Paul Rigby from ARPAS, Stef Williams from Aerialworx, John Moorland Chief Operating officer from EuroUSC, John Wright from FlightPath and many more. Recent press speculation about drone operators has raised the subject of training. Organisers will be staging a series of high quality training sessions at the show over the two days. This will pioneer the way to highlight the need for training in this rapidly growing marketplace. The event will see manufacturers demonstrate new products, celebrity guests will be in attendance as well as tech and drone industry speakers and a brand-new dedicated FPV (First Person View) racing circuit. A rapidly developing sport, FPV racing or drone racing pits drone operators against each other using first person view technology. The show will be the biggest gathering of like-minded manufacturers and consumers the UK industry has ever seen and the launch venue for many new and exciting products. Richard Wright, the UK Drone Show spokesperson said, “We are extremely excited to be working with the CAA and Ofcom to deliver regulatory information on the use of UAV/Drones in the UK. We are honoured that the UAVHA group who oversees the hard work of the humanitarian organisations and groups working across the world using the UAV/drone technology have chosen our show to host the very first award of its kind. ”We are equally excited about hosting the UK's first major indoor FPV racing circuit. This new craze is rapidly developing in to one of the world’s fastest growing sports.” Latest news", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T18:40:35.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
