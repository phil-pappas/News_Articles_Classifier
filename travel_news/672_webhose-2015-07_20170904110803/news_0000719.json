The home screen displays a grid of airport codes listed alphabetically. Click on the relevant code and you’re taken to a page with a list of transportation options. You’ll find the symbol of a bus, taxi, train or other vehicle with a price tag and time it takes to reach the city center. I was impressed that for Dublin, Ireland, they even gave me the bus number with a link to the bus company’s website and timetable. It also had UberX options where applicable. Need something to do once you arrive? It uses Viator to link to a few popular attractions and activities, but it felt helpful, not distracting or annoying.\n>> What’s not : It’s still in beta so use it with caution, but I didn’t have any problems when I tested it. The only thing I wanted was more airport listings. There is space on the grid for you to request an airport to be added. It’s a great addition for travelers. I’ll be ready for the app. Nudge, nudge.
