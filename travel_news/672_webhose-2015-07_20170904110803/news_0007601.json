Entirely modular, it offers a large choice of interior layouts and flexibility in terms of external livery. It is accessible to all, in particular to passengers with reduced mobility thanks to its fully low floor and bridging plates to cover the gap between the train and the platform. \n\n\nCitadis Dualis is up to 99% recyclable. Designed with lightweight materials, it consumes 4 times less energy than a bus and 10 times less than a car in terms of Kwh/seated passenger. Ultra silent, it emits noise levels 5 dBA below those generated by automotive traffic in towns, or nearly 4 times less noise. \n\n\n” Alstom is proud to be able to place the entire fleet of 24 tram-trains at the disposal of the Pays de la Loire region. From now on they will circulate on two lines: Nantes-Châteaubriant and Nantes-Clisson,” said Ana Giros, Managing Director Alstom Transport France. \n\n\nAlstom’s tram-trains, a symbol of French industrial excellence, are exported worldwide. In March 2013, the city of Ottawa ordered 34 Citadis Spirit trainsets, the North American version of Citadis Dualis, from Alstom. \n\n\nCitadis Dualis are entirely designed and produced at Valenciennes. Five other Alstom sites are involved in their production: Ornans for the motors, Le Creusot for the bogies, Tarbes for the traction, Saint-Ouen and Villeurbanne for the electronic equipment and control systems.
