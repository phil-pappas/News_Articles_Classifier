We've been a territory since 1999, that's sixteen years. It's the newest territory in Canada. I don't get why it's left off.\" \nThe centre receives many tourist visits with five major passenger cruise ships stopping in Cambridge Bay during the summer, said Ootoova, but many visitors lack knowledge about Nunavut's history and culture. He said more education about Nunavut is needed and leaving it off a map of the country doesn't help. \nWildrose tourism critic Ron Orr said the artistically-rendered map \"disregards aboriginal and Inuit status and disregards the status of Nunavut itself\" and criticized the agency's \"bloated bureaucracy\" for not catching the error before print. \nTravel Alberta promptly admitted the design error and apologized on Monday. \n\"It was an error on our end and we do apologize if it causes any concern or confusion for anyone. We are correcting the imagery to ensure it doesn't happen again,\" said spokesperson Jennifer Anderson. \nAnderson couldn't say how widely the advertisement was circulated but said the map was included as part of a ten-page \"call to action\" showcasing Alberta's major tourism destinations in the June edition of United Airlines' Hemisphere Magazine. \n\"We hope that our tourism friends in Nunavut understand this was a mistake and we're going to be reaching out to them as well,\" she said. \"We want to always ensure the accuracy of our marketing.\" \nTravel Alberta is the tourism marketing agency of the Government of Alberta that is governed by the Travel Alberta Act and a Board of Directors accountable to the Minister of Culture and Tourism. \nmatthew.dykstra@sunmedia.ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T16:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T17:16:31.067+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
