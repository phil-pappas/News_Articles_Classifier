A recent stint onboard P&O Pacific Dawn to the South Pacific dispelled all her misconceptions about cruising. \n\"I have a lot of clients say they think they'll be bored but I can't stress enough how much there is to do. I thought the same thing, but now I'm 100% hooked,\" she gushed. \nFrom kids clubs to the adults' only area, nightly entertainment to gourmet meals, Hebe says it doesn't take much convincing considering what's included with a P&O cruise. \nFor group travel, Hebe couldn't recommend a better holiday. \n\"Cruising takes out a lot of the decision making. Activity programs outline what's on each day, so it's easy to organise everyone. Even though the ships are huge, you can't really go too far,\" she laughs. \nHebe clearly loves spreading the benefits of cruising, but there's plenty more to love about her job. \n\"I love the fact I get to come to work each day and change people's lives through travel. I don't know any other job where you can say you get to be part of something like that.\" Call Flight Centre for your next holiday on 1300 499 787. cruise", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T00:01:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
