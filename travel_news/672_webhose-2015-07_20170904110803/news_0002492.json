A 30-year-old Briton with the initials A.B.O. was gored in the groin area. None of the three was said to be in serious condition.\n\nA reveler is tossed by a cow during a celebration held at the bullring after the running of the bulls of the San Fermin festival in Pamplona, Spain, Tuesday, July 7, 2015.

(AP Photo/Daniel Ochoa de Olza) \nThree other Americans were among the eight others injured, most with bruises sustained in falls and crowd crushes during the nationally-televised run that lasted just over two minutes.\nIn its first report after the run, the Spanish Red Cross only had details of one person being gored and six people injured.\nThe daily run sees people dashing with six bulls along a narrow, 930-yard (850-meter) course from a holding pen to the city's bull ring. The bulls are then killed by professional matadors in bullfights each afternoon. The nine-day fiesta in Pamplona, which features 24-hour street partying, was made famous in Ernest Hemingway's 1926 novel \"The Sun Also Rises\" and attracts thousands of foreign tourists.\nBull runs are a traditional part of summer festivals across Spain. Dozens of people are injured each year in the runs, most in falls.\nTwo men have died recently after being gored by bulls in Spanish festivals â€” one Saturday in the eastern town of Grao de Castellon and another June 24 in the southwestern town of Coria.\nIn all, 15 people have died from gorings in San Fermin since record-keeping began in 1924.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T10:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T17:35:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
