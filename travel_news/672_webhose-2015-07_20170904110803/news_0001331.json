That is why songs of those (films) can’t be used as welcome tune or ringtone.”\nThe total number of mobile phone subscriptions in Bangladesh stood at over 121 million in January this year, according to data available on the website of Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission.\n 09, 2015 10:26 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T06:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T04:26:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
