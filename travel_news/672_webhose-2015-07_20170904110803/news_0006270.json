Then you'll do far worse than to take your next break in one of these countries. They are the 10 least densely populated, measured in number of people per square kilometre, according to the latest available figures from the UN Population Division. Such trips could mean roaming the plains of Mongolia, striking through rainforest in Suriname, or cruising the vast fjords of Greenland. This is how to do remote, wild and adventurous – with the figures to back up your post-holiday bragging. 1. Greenland Population density: 0.0 people per sq km Rounded to one decimal place, the population density of Greenland is officially 0.0. The world’s largest island is home to around 56,000 people, meaning that a population around the size of west Devon (an area of 448.3 square miles) inhabits an area of 836,330 sq miles. This vast land, which has been inhabited for around 4,500 years, has mountainous shorelines, long summer days and jewel-blue fjords . Try visiting the Arctic ghost town of Skoldungen, abandoned for more accessible settlements in 1961. Getting there: Discover the World (01737 214 250; discover-the-world.co.uk ) has a 14-night Greenland Explorer cruise from £5,600 per person, excluding flights. Greenland has the lowest population density on Earth Photo: AP • Beautiful remote places to stay 2. Falkland Islands Population density: 0.3 people per sq km This archipelago on the Patagonian Shelf is home to just 3,000 people. Argentina famously lays claim to this British Overseas Territory, but a referendum in 2013 saw the population vote overwhelmingly to remain British – just three of the 1,517 votes cast favoured Argentinian rule. Chris Moss, a Telegraph Travel contributor, says it is a “special, strange place and those who do make the effort often become repeat visitors . Stanley [the capital] provides a nice homely stopover on voyages that revolve around wild seas, icebergs and penguins. Pubs, a post office, a cathedral, an excellent museum and good gastronomy mean that a stay is not just quirky, but actually very pleasant too.” Getting there: Journey Latin America (020 3468 0965; journeylatinamerica.co.uk ) offers a 14-day private trip to Chile and the Falklands, with a week on the remote islands, from £4,936 per person, excluding international flights. • 10 of the best technology free holidays The Falkland Islands are famous for their wool production, and are comfortingly British Photo: AP 3. Mongolia Population density: 1.9 people per sq km A landlocked country of wide steppe and semi-desert, Mongolia has a population that clusters in the capital, Ulaanbaatar, leaving swathes of land pinpricked only by small nomadic communities threatened by harsh weather, storms and economic difficulties. Visitors are lured by the chance to ride horses across wild, open landscapes (the country had an area of 1.5 million sq km) and the chance to stay in remote gers that offer an insight into traditional ways of living. Getting there: In the Saddle offers a range of challenging riding holidays in Mongolia, including a departure that coincides with the festival of the eagle hunters in the Altai mountains, from £1,416 per person, excluding flights (01299 272997; inthesaddle.com ). • Kate Humble: living with Nomads in Mongolia Mongolia promises wide, open landscapes Photo: AP 4. Western Sahara Population density: 2.3 people per sq km This land of 266,000 sq km (103,000 sq.mi.) is a disputed territory, between Morocco and the Polisario Front, an Algeria-backed rebel movement. The land is mostly flat desert, rich in phosphates, with extra resources in the form of fisheries and possibly offshore oil. The Foreign Office advises against all travel to within 30km north/west and to the south/east of the Berm, a 2,700km long wall dividing the desert, and says that in remote areas there is a risk of landmines. There are no advisories against visiting the area around Laayoune, the largest city, where most of the populace lives. Namibia's sand dunes are its most famous feature, but it also has grasslands and interesting cities Photo: AP 5. Namibia Population density: 2.9 people per sq km The shifting dunes of this southern African country occupy much of its landmass, although it also has game-rich grasslands and a semi-arid Central Plateau. Top attractions include the Kalahari Desert, the Skeleton Coast, and Lüderitz, a bright harbour town with early 20th century German Art Nouveau buildings. Getting there: The Ultimate Travel Company (020 3627 6264; theultimatetravelcompany.co.uk ) offers a 17-day Highlights of Namibia itinerary from £3,885 per person, including flights • Namibia: Trip of a Lifetime 6. French Guiana Population density: 2.9 people per sq km France in South America can be found in French Guiana, an overseas territory of our neighbour across the Channel. The product is a strange mixture of western motorways, colonial architecture and French law alongside dense rainforest and Caribbean cuisine. Visiting in 2011 for Telegraph Travel, Chris Moss noted how \"Liberte, Égalité, Fraternité\" was stencilled on the side of a small government building five minutes' walk from the border post at Le Juliette. Two minutes' walk away was the transportation camp of St Laurent du Marconi, where 70,000 convicted criminals and political prisoners were sent between 1852 and 1953. Getting there: Journey Latin America (020 3468 0965; journeylatinamerica.co.uk ) offers a 19-day group tour visiting Venezuela, Suriname and the Guianas from £4,090 per person, excluding international flights. Australians cluster on the coast, leaving the Red Centre sparsely populated Photo: AP 7. Australia Population density: 3.1 people per sq km Mark Chipperfield, our Australia expert, says it as one of the world’s greatest travel destinations for its “extraordinary scenery and exotic wildlife” and diverse landscapes: “Red dirt deserts, tropical beaches, snow-capped mountains and temperate rainforest can all be found here.” It has a vast area – 7,692,024 km² – and a relatively low a population of 23 million – around a third of that of the UK. Citizens cluster in the coastal cities such as Sydney, Canberra and Perth, leaving much of the Red Centre empty.

Iceland Population density: 3.3 people per sq km The Northern Lights may shine bright over this lunar landscape of snow, rock, ice, and volcano, but those who venture to see them won’t have many companions. Iceland has a population of around 330,000, mostly centred in the cool capital Reykjavík. Elsewhere on the island there are glacier walks, climbs, descents inside volcanoes (really) and some of the world’s best diving: the gaps between tectonic plates are filled with crystal-clear waters. Getting there: Regent Holidays (0203 733 8979; regent-holidays.co.uk ) offers group tours and tailor-made trips to Iceland, including an Iceland highlights five-night fly-drive from £750 per person including flights. 9. Suriname Population density: 3.3 people per sq km This sovereign state, with Dutch as the official language, is squeezed inbetween French Guiana, Guyana and Brazil in South America. Although the country is mostly rainforest – there are no natural harbours and few railways or roads – its wonderfully-named capital, Paramaribo, is home to Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral, which would not look out of place in a European city square. John Gimlette, visiting in 2011, said: “ If I were to design the perfect city, it would be like Paramaribo . It would all be white, and have a river running through it. There'd be plantations and fruit trees, and little canals would ripple through the centre. There'd be no business district or overbearing banks, and nothing would be taller than a church. At the heart of it all would be a little purple fortress, like a hat full of mansions.” Getting there: Steppes Travel (01285 601 771; steppestravel.co.uk/suriname ) offers tailor-made trips to Suriname, with opportunities to explore Paramaribo, and to visit the Maroon tribe in dugout canoes. Botswana offers one of Africa's best safari experiences Photo: AP 10. Botswana Population density: 3.5 people per sq km Botswana is the world’s largest producer of diamonds, but as it tries to lessen its dependency on exports of the jewels, safari tourism is developing. Indeed, it has been described as offering one of the world’s best game drive experiences : the Big Five are all on the prowl. Other highlights of the country, 40 per cent of which is protected and conserved for wildlife, include the wetlands of the Okavango Delta and the Kalahari Desert. Getting there: The Ultimate Travel Company (020 3627 6264; theultimatetravelcompany.co.uk ) offers a 10-night tented safari from £5,663 per person, including flights. Population densities are persons per square km, as of 1 July 2012, the latest figures available, sourced from the UN Population Division . The densities in the map were predominantly sourced from the UN Population Division, although a few figures were taken from other sources.
