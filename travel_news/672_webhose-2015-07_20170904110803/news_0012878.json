Hotels - Airlines - CVBs - Destinations - people Happy Birthday America: Today Democrats and Republicans are just Americans Tourism: Is the United States of America the most beautiful country in the world? Adv: \nBy eTN Staff in Haleiwa, Hawaii, USA | Jul 04, 2015 Adv: \nIs the United States of America the most beautiful country in the world? Today more than 300 million Americans may think so. Yes, we have tremendous challenges, but today no matter what- we're all Americans. \nTravel and Tourism is part of our culture and one of our biggest job creator, money earner and export. \nWe're a nation of immigrants and love to share our breathtaking country with the world. Last year more than 34 million visitors from every corner of the globe came to see us. Today, July 4th is our birthday. We love to celebrate it with you! \nOn November 19, 1863 U.S President Abraham Lincoln in his famous Gettysburg, Pennsylvania address said: \"The United States of America shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\" \nOn July 4th, 1986 president Ronald Reagan said to the nation: \"America’s past of which we’re so proud, our hopes and aspirations for the future of the world and this much-loved country — these things far outweigh what little divides us. And so tonight we reaffirm that Jew and gentile, we are one nation under God; that black and white, we are one nation indivisible; that Republican and Democrat, we are all Americans. Tonight, with heart and hand, through whatever trial and travail, we pledge ourselves to each other and to the cause of human freedom, the cause that has given light to this land and hope to the world.\" \n\"Our nation was founded on a bedrock principle that we are all created equal. The project of each generation is to bridge the meaning of those founding words with the realities of changing times -- a never-ending quest to ensure those words ring true for every single American.\" \nLast week president Obama said after the U.S. supreme court ruling on equality: \"Progress on this journey often comes in small increments, sometimes two steps forward, one step back, propelled by the persistent effort of dedicated citizens. And then sometimes, there are days like this when that slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt.\" \n\"In my second inaugural address, I said that if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well. It is gratifying to see that principle enshrined into law.\" \nFrom all of us at eTN: Happy 4th to all fellow Americans ! It's going to be a beautiful proud day for all our 50 United States and territories: From New York to California, from Florida to Alaska, from the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico to Hawaii and on to Guam, Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa - come and celebrate with us!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T12:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T18:21:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
