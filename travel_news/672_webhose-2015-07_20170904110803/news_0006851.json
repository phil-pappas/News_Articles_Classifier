After the funeral, one of his friends tried to cheer me up by recommending a trip on the Nordland Railway in Norway.\n'You can see half the country in ten hours — we've nothing over here to compare.\nThe West Highland Line, Settle to Carlisle Railway, the Cornish main line — they're London to Croydon in comparison.'\nNordic but nice: The Nordland Railway speeds through the most scenic parts of Norway\nBut the trip is not just for railway specialists. The Nordland offers the chance to see arguably the most scenic parts of Norway, while its termini are fascinating.\nIt covers the 450 miles from Trondheim to Bodo in the north by a night train and a day train in either direction.\nThe northbound day train leaves Trondheim at 7.38am, which means spending the previous day in Norway's most northerly city. But that's no hardship.\nIn the morning I walked along the River Nid, which is lined with old warehouses painted in a harmonious palette of faded browns, rust reds and mustard yellows.\n Next The swanky side of the Jekyll and Hyde island: Inside Zante,... Grade I listed mansion that once hosted famous In and Out... All hail the American Queen! Step on the steamboat which... Inside the colourful 1950s-style Thompson Hotel on Miami... Ships — blurred by the drizzle — boomed their horns on the Fjord.\nAt the National Military Museum in the courtyard of the cathedral, I learnt much about the Nordland Railway.\nDuring the occupation, the Nazis pushed the line northwards (it didn't reach Bodo until 1962), using PoWs as slave labour, while resistance forces concentrated on blowing it up.\nThe museum shows how, with displays of detonators and fuses.\nNext morning, I found the Nordland train being boarded by Norwegians equipped for wilderness emergencies, with state-of-the-art rucksacks and indestructible jumpers.\nNorthern light: Trondheim's River Nid is lined with old wooden warehouses in a startling palette of brown, green, orange and red\nSome walked towards the train with two sticks, like cross-country skiers.\nEverything on board was wellordered and clean, like Norway itself. I was in first, or Komfort, class, which was if anything slightly too spacious (my table was too far away from the chair).\nThe railway starts by skirting a fjord. I asked the Norwegian in the next seat what it was called.\n'Trondheim Fjord', he said. He took great pleasure in saying 'still Trondheim Fjord' several times over the next hundred or so miles.\nAlong the shores were unattended boats or half-built wooden houses, creating scenes fit for the covers of Scandi crime novels.\nUnder the grey sky, the lush farmland of Trondelag, hinterland of Trondheim, was such a contrastingly vivid green that I felt there must be something wrong with British grass.\nWhen the Trondheim Fjord finally disappeared (only for another to appear), I turned to the eastern side, where lay a vertiginous gorge.\nThe trip is not just for railway specialists. The Nordland offers the chance to see arguably the most scenic parts of Norway\n'Namsen river,' explained the Norwegian chap, who was eating a fascinatingly well-organised meal from a green Perspex lunchbox with separate compartments for cold meat, cheese, berries and yogurt.\nI asked if he particularly liked this train. 'Particularly,' he said.\nIn the buffet, I bought a plate of lapskaus, pork stew, that I was assured was traditional and gluten free.\nI bought a coffee and took it back to my carriage, whereupon the Norwegian chap aid: 'You bought that?'\nPointing to a vending machine I had overlooked, he added: 'No need. Coffee is free in Komfort class.'\nOur train began to climb, until we were at an angle more usually associated with Swiss railways.\nThe trees became thinner, then disappeared. All was grey rock and now, our train moving silently, ike some sort of lunar vehicle.\nThere came an announcement, more urgent than the laid-back ones hitherto: 'Your attention please! We are about to cross the Arctic Circle.'\nStone pyramids on either side of the track marked the spot.\nOther highlights included a grey eagle flying lazily over raging rapids and several furious mountain torrents that seemed to be aiming maliciously for the train, only to be swept under the tracks at the last moment.\nSee sights such as spectacular lakes and mountains along the railway ride around Trondheim\nI was never bored. In fact, I felt spoilt by the variegated drama of the landscape.\nBy the time we reached Bodo at 5.28pm, every possible spectacle had been revealed. Bodo is not pretty, but beautiful snow-capped islands and mountains encroach from every direction.\nThe town was flattened by German bombs in 1940.\nThe Nordland Museum tells the story completely free of self-pity: 'Some say the new architecture is boring.'\nActually it grows on you, especially the austere cathedral.\nThe harbour seems to comprise half the town, and there are trips to the Lofoten islands.\nI passed a pleasant day in the Norwegian Aviation Museum, where planes, even big ones, dangle from the ceiling, and the moody lighting makes the old ejector seats and oxygen masks resemble medieval armour.\nI returned by the night train in a well-appointed sleeping berth, but spent much of the journey watching the landscape under the unreal, pink glow of the north Norwegian summer night, which is really no night at all.\nIn winter, this journey might include sight of the Northern Lights.\nEither way, you're not going to sleep much, because the Nordland Railway is a waking dream, likely to be long-remembered.\nTRAVEL FACTS: Plan your own trip to Norway Norwegian Air ( norwegian.com ) flies directly from Gatwick to Trondheim from £90 return.\nThe Nordland Railway is operated by Norwegian State Railways, NSB (0047 815 00 888, nsb.no ). Prices from £20 for a single fare.\nMore information at visitnorway.com .\nAndrew Martin's latest book is Belles & Whistles: Journeys Through Time On Britain's Trains (Profile).\nRead more: Welcome to Norwegian - Norwegian NSB - Kjøp togbillett - nsb.no Travel to Norway - Official Travel Guide to Norway - visitnorway.com", "external_links": ["https://www.nsb.no/", "http://www.norwegian.com/", "http://www.visitnorway.com/uk/", "http://dailym.ai/1GNq3Mo"], "published": "2015-07-25T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T13:19:50.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
