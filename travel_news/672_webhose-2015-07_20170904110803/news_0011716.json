(Photo: Kearney Breland)\n132 CONNECT 64 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Two U.S. towns will have a memorable Fourth of July celebration this weekend.\nOroville, Calif., and Waveland, Miss., are the winners of the third annual Red, White and You contest, a collaboration between USA TODAY and Destination America, the cable TV network dedicated to all-American entertainment.\nThe towns will get all-expenses-paid fireworks displays and celebrations, emceed by the stars of Destination America's Impact Wrestling.\nMore than 2,600 entries were submitted on behalf of towns nationwide.\nThis year, Waveland is commemorating the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which nearly destroyed the Gulf Coast community. The town has not had a Fourth of July fireworks display since.\n\"We were Ground Zero for Hurricane Katrina and we've been fighting ever since to come back and we are coming back a lot stronger than before slowly but surely,\" says resident Donna Estopinal, who submitted the town's application. \"We want people to see what progress has been made.\"\nWaveland Mayor Mike Smith says that many residents left the town after the hurricane. Before Katrina, 8,000 people lived within the town's five square miles. Since then, the town has annexed two more square miles but only has about 6,000 residents.\n\"Waveland was not on the national map when Katrina hit,\" Smith says. \"When Katrina hit, it put us there as Ground Zero. Now, 10 years later, with this celebration, it puts us in the national spotlight in a positive manner.\"\nThe town's beloved Garfield Ladner Memorial Pier has been rebuilt just in time for the celebration.\n\"It's a perfect spot for a party and a perfect time for a party,\" Smith says.\nIn addition to fireworks, the festivities will include a spread of all-American foods like hot dogs and ice cream, carnival activities like a moon bounce, and musical performances. Wresting star Jeremy Borash will emcee.\nA monetary donation will also be made to the Where Angels Play Foundation to help fund the construction of a playground dedicated to members of the Bane family who lost their lives during Katrina.\nOroville, Calif., has not had a big Fourth of July celebration in years because of the state's drought and economic struggles. (Photo: City of Oroville)\nOroville is also facing challenges.\nThe community has not had a big Fourth of July celebration in years because of the state's drought and economic struggles.\nNicknamed the City of Gold because of its participation in the gold rush, Oroville is also home to a large community of veterans who used to appreciate the Fourth of July celebrations.\nThe 770-foot Oroville Dam had been the backdrop of a large fireworks display, but it's become increasingly more difficult to raise money for it, says Mayor Linda Dahlmeier.\n\"Asking the community during hard times was rough,\" she says. \"Eventually we could not raise enough money and it went dark for a couple of years. Our pyrotechnics person does everything he can to try to save it at ninth hour. It was nice this year to not have to struggle for every dime down to the wire.\"\nThe California drought has had a severe impact on Oroville.\n\"Because we are a large agricultural community, we feel it twice as much,\" Dahlmeier says. \"It affects so many people. We feed a lot of people with our crops.\"\nOroville resident Deliah Robison nominated her town for the honor. The mother of two grew up in Oroville.\n\"We had not had a big celebration for so long. It was very depressing because I grew up with the fireworks. It was one of those things that brought people together,\" she says. \"We've been suffering from a drought and spirits were down.\"\nThe Independence Day celebration will include children's rides, food, fireworks and appearances by wrestling stars Madison Payne, Josh Matthews and EC3.\nDestination America is also making a $5,000 donation to help restore the Feather Falls Nature Center.\nLast year's winners were Prescott, Ariz., a town that was still recovering from devastating wildfires that killed 19 firefighters, and Hamtramck, Mich., a city hit by hard financial times.\n132 CONNECT 64 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1IycAOz TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/07/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635714725166529172-IMG-6780.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cc8485838f96429ef8dd00f1f7fcbc0e91c170b7/c=294-0-4890-3456&r=x383&c=540x380/local/-/media/2015/07/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635714725166529172-IMG-6780.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/05/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635684833381575373-Waveland-Veterans-Memorial-Uncropped.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1IycAOz&text=Two%20towns%20to%20enjoy%20free%20Independence%20Day%20celebrations&via=usatoday", "http://usat.ly/1IycAOz", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0d8bce2bf73c661ca839a3ba1baea3c206b49653/c=205-0-3416-2414&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/05/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635684833381575373-Waveland-Veterans-Memorial-Uncropped.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1IycAOz&mini=true"], "published": "2015-07-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T09:10:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
