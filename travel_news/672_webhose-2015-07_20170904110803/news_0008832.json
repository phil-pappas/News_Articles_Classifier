I was lying drenched in oil and cocooned in wraps as yet more warm oil was poured gently on to my forehead until my hair and scalp were sodden.\nStrangely enough it was incredibly soothing, and within minutes I could feel myself drifting off into a state of deep relaxation.\nThe ancient ayurvedic therapy of shirodhara was part of a Sleep Well programme in the Thai resort of Soneva Kiri.\nBarefoot luxury: Villas come with their own pools at the Soneva Kiri in Thailand which has its own Sleep Well programme\nI have been an insomniac for years, waking at all times of the night, so I was keen to find out if this could really cure me, especially as there was the added complication of jet-lag to contend with.\nI had certainly chosen the ideal location. It felt impossibly remote, situated on a jungle-clad headland on the island of Koh Kood in Gulf of Thailand near the Cambodian border.\nAs soon as I arrived, I was handed a shoebag – emblazoned with the motto ‘No news, no shoes’ – for my sandals. It said it all. I could already feel the stresses and strains of daily life fading away.\n Next From Michelin-star joints to a themed slaughterhouse... All aboard for the Fjords!

Parents of the Caribbean: The couple raising their toddler... 21 shares The island has been barely touched by tourism. Little fishing villages are scattered along the coastline where shacks are perched on stilts over the water, while inland a couple of concrete roads snake through the dense vegetation.\nThe resort lies at its northern tip, with just 35 villas, some facing directly on to the sea and others hidden away in the rainforest.\nThe word ‘villa’ is in fact a misnomer. These aren’t modern whitewashed houses but beautifully crafted in locally sourced wood and bamboo with thatched roofs and canvas canopies which blend into the landscape.\nThe phrase ‘barefoot luxury’ could have been coined here and I could see why it has appealed to movie stars including Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.\nThe resort lies at its northern tip of Koh Kood, with just 35 villas, some facing directly on to the sea and others hidden away in the rainforest\nFor a start, you never need leave the privacy of your villa. Mine was enormous and stood isolated in the dense undergrowth, encircled by high cane fences.\nIt had its own full-size pool surrounded by a vast sundeck with numerous shady terraces and lounge areas.\nThe bedroom had floor-to-ceiling windows looking across the bay and there were hot outdoor showers and a Jacuzzi.\nThe television, stored away in a leather trunk, was strictly for DVDs only.\nBest of all, I had my own Girl Friday. Khun Caew, a pretty young Thai, was on hand virtually 24 hours a day to organise everything for me.\nShe unpacked my bags, made table reservations and even offered to organise a chef to come and cook for me if I required.\nMy sleep therapy began with a consultation with Dr Amit, the ayurvedic doctor who, to my dismay, recommended a three-day detox.\nSeeing my face drop, he assured me it could wait until I returned home. I didn’t want to miss out on the sumptuous Thai buffets or the delicious breakfasts where I tucked into fresh tropical fruits, exotic juices and raw organic salads grown in the hotel’s eco-centre.\nBalanced approach: Wendy’s yoga teacher Melody was on hand to help the Sleep Well programme\nI could choose from a range of dining options. One evening I took a speedboat through the mangrove swamps on the Klong Yai Kee river to Chez Benz to sample a traditional nine-course menu of shellfish and fresh vegetables from the local market.\nThere were light lunches on a floating island in the middle of a lake and alfresco dinners on the seashore where I sat, toes in the sand, surrounded by flickering candles and flaming torches.\nFor a bird’s-eye view of the ocean I was winched sky-high in a tree-pod for breakfast.\nSitting in what appeared to be a giant nest, I gazed out through the treetops at a cobalt-blue sea while the waiter whizzed through the air on a zipwire delivering food in a bamboo basket.\nBy the time they arrived, my eggs were well and truly scrambled.\nMost days I was up early to join Melody, my yoga teacher in the spa. My one-to-one lessons were held in a tranquil room opening on to a lily pond where she taught me breathing techniques to help me relax.\nI was prodded and pummelled during a series of massages before trying out more arcane therapies.\nDuring one treatment, Tibetan singing bowls were placed on my body so that the sounds and vibrations reverberated deep within me, creating a profound sense of calm.\nBut my favourite was a craniosacral session with Cameron, a visiting practitioner, who placed his hands gently beneath my neck and back while talking about ‘tidal rhythms in the cerebral fluid’ and ‘realigning energy fields’.\nMeals on wires: Breakfast is delivered in the morning to the tree-pod via a zipline\nI hadn’t a clue what he was referring to, but he only had to hold my feet for a few moments before I instantly fell asleep.\nIt was all very well nodding off during a treatment, but the real test came at bedtime.\nDr Amit recommended I avoid certain foodstuffs in the evening and that I unwind for at least an hour or two before retiring.\nI was to ignore his advice at my peril. One evening I decided to watch a late-night movie at the open-air cinema, curling up in blankets and munching popcorn under a canopy of twinkling stars.\nOf course it was a big mistake. Afterwards, I lay awake for ages before finally dropping off in the early hours.\nOn another occasion I joined Caew at the observatory for a lesson in astronomy. As the revolving roof spun around, I peered through the huge telescope to catch a glimpse of the dark rings of Jupiter circling its circumference.\nWendy (left) pictured with Khun Caew (right) a pretty young Thai, who was on hand nearly 24 hours a day to organise everything from meal reservations to unpacking luggage\nThat night I was woken by vivid nightmares in which I was hurtling through space.\nAfter my morning therapies, I felt so relaxed I’d head to the private beach for a snooze.\nIt would have been a good half-hour walk through the lush foliage, but I pootled along in a couple of minutes on an electric buggy provided for the guests.\nWith swaying palms and sand like icing sugar, it was the picture-postcard tropical idyll. I had barely settled down on a sunlounger before I was plied with cold towels, iced juices and fresh fruit sorbets.\nOn my last evening, I put all my newly acquired techniques to use.\nI lit scented candles, sprayed the pillow with grapefruit essence and applied essential oils to my pulse points before covering my eyes with a chilled lavender mask.\nTo my amazement, I had the best night’s sleep ever.\nTRAVEL FACTS: ITC Luxury Travel ( itcluxurytravel.co.uk , 01244 355527) offers seven nights at Soneva Kiri from £3,499pp.\nThis includes return British Airways flights to Bangkok, internal air transfers and half-board accommodation.\nThe Sleep Well programme is available at its Six Senses Spa.\nFor further details, visit soneva.com .\nRead more: Luxury Holidays| Luxury Travel| Luxury Hotels| ITC Luxury Travel Official Resorts and Residences Site | The Soneva Group", "external_links": ["http://soneva.com/", "http://dailym.ai/1GP84oY", "http://itcluxurytravel.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-07-26T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T22:30:00.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
