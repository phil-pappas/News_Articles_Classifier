Subscribe now to \nAlready a subscriber? Sign In Here Mick Jagger didn’t just happen upon Lombardo’s. That the Rolling Stones lead singer was directed to the Hertel Avenue restaurant was a testament to the Hyatt Regency Buffalo staff and how well-versed they are in regard to area restaurants and attractions. Indeed, they’re good at playing the tourism “mix-and-match” game when it comes to helping guests see the sights and find great places to dine. Connecting visitors, especially business travelers, with a restaurant or destination is a critical yet often under-appreciated part of the tourism industry. Get it right and visitors leave the area with a good impression. Screw it up and there could be some serious fallout. “You definitely have to be informed and have the answers,” said Mark Bibb , general manager of the Adam’s Mark hotel in Buffalo. “You’d be surprised how many times guests want personal references and preferences when it comes to local places.” Bibb said that when working with hotel staff, he puts an emphasis on knowledge of restaurants, attractions, weather and driving conditions. Some of it comes from weekly tip sheets emailed by Visit Buffalo Niagara to area hotels. And some comes from workers’ institutional knowledge. Bibb encourages the hotel’s veteran staffers to show new employees the importance of knowing what’s happening in and around town. And it’s not just the front desk crew. Bellhops, maids, waiters and others must be properly prepped, as well. “You never know who is going to ask the question and when it might be asked,” he said. Questions vary between business and leisure travelers, and there are constant inquiries from those visiting the region for a sporting event. Leisure travelers are just as interested in restaurants as they are in attractions. Chicken wings and Niagara Falls are usually at the top of the list. Business travelers are interested in restaurants, of course, but they’re also looking for something to do after dinner, be it a performance or concert or a sports event. “They tend to have a more specific idea,” Bibb said. Training and information are key, said Patrick Kaler , president and CEO of Visit Buffalo Niagara . On Thursdays, the regional tourism and marketing organization sends a so-called cheat sheet of top things to do in the area to more than 1,200 people, from front desk workers to hotel general managers and even taxi drivers. Next month, Visit Buffalo Niagara will run a day-long fam tour, short for familiarization, for hospitality workers to remind them about local sites and destinations. “From my experience, visitors –especially business travelers – really want to know and go where the locals go,” Kaler said. “Everybody has chain department stores, but visitors want the local, small-business flavor. Those are the experiences that matter and can make a great impression.” Catering to business travelers is the forte of the Mansion on Delaware, a 28-room boutique hotel whose guests run the gamut from visiting executives to celebrities and leisure tourists. Owner Dennis Murphy said he trains his staff to know the true Buffalo flavor. Restaurants are key, but so is keeping abreast of roadwork. “The worst thing you can do is send someone down a road that’s under construction,” he said. Murphy described his staff as “local curators.” “They have to know how to send different people to different places,” he said. \nWant Buffalo Travel news in your inbox?
