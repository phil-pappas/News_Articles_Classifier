Picture: Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority Source: Supplied \nLOUISIANA is in the middle of a crisis — it’s essentially being wiped off the map. \nSince the 1930s the sinking American state, home to 4.6 million people, has lost a quarter of its coastal land size . \nTo date, nearly 5000sq km of land has been swallowed by water. \nWithout drastic action, the region will continue to sink, the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) warns. \nAnd it’s all because the Mississippi River Delta is disappearing into the Gulf of Mexico. \nThe CPRA hopes to save the area over the next 50 years at a cost of $68 billion. \nIt details the problems it faces in its 2017 Coastal Master Plan Project : \n“Levees and floodgates on the Mississippi River have successfully provided national flood control and economic benefits. \n“But these forms of river management have also channelled the Mississippi River and its tributaries into the Gulf of Mexico, depriving the coastal ecosystem of the freshwater and sediment it needs to survive. \n“Dredging canals for oil and gas exploration and pipelines provided our nation with critical energy supplies, but these activities also took a toll on the landscape, weakening marshes and allowing salt water to spread higher into coastal basins. Sea level rise, subsidence, storms, and invasive species add further stress.” The land loss has been massive.

We must take bold action now before it’s too late.” The remains of Cat Island, off the Gulf Coast. Picture: Restore the Mississippi River Delta Source: Facebook \nSo in a hugely ambitious plan, they aim to protect against flooding and create a sustainable coast, including the rebuilding of wetlands. \nThe plan is to remove sediment from the water and into sinking basins around New Orleans, 144km from the mouth of the Mississippi River. \nThey will also stabilise the shoreline, by rebuilding oyster reefs to protect it from wave action and by restoring plants to help keep the soil together. \nNon-profit news websites ProPublica and The Lens took part in a joint project analysing the plan, with reporter Bob Marshall finding: “What they’re trying to do here has never been done before. They’re trying to rebuild some of the wetlands that have been lost and then to maintain that against all these unknown variables, such as subsidence and sea level rise and lack of funding. \n“In every sense, it is as ambitious in those two areas as going to the moon for the first time.” Flooding predictions.
