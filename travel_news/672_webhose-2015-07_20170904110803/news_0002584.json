Gallacher became the talk of the media and social networking sites earlier this week after interviewing Open Championship favourite Jordan Spieth on the driving range of the award-winning resort in ground-damaging three-inch stiletto heels. \nThe 39-year-old was mistakenly accused of speaking to the Masters and US Open champion on the hallowed turf of St Andrews’ Old Course – venue for this week’s Open – only for the interview to actually have taken place at Fairmont St Andrews on the outskirts of town. John Keating, Fairmont St Andrews’ general manager, said: “All the comments have come as a complete surprise to us given that Fairmont St Andrews was clearly recognisable from the pictures used. “Contrary to the reports, the only damage done was by Jordan Spieth smashing a small glass target on the driving range with a perfectly-struck shot. We would be delighted to see Kirsty back here any time.” The multi-award-winning Fairmont St Andrews sits in a majestic cliff-top location overlooking the North Sea and the historic ‘Auld Grey Toon’. Voted IAGTO’s European Golf Resort of the Year in 2012 and winner of the award for ‘best large hotel’ in the 2014 Scottish Golf Tourism Awards, the resort boasts two championship golf courses – The Torrance and The Kittocks – and has played host to a number of prestigious events, including both the Open Championship’s final local qualifying and the Scottish Senior Open, which it has hosted for the past six years.
