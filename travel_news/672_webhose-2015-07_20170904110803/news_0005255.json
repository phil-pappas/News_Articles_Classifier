Located in the heart of the city, within the Sino-Ocean Taikoo Li Chengdu, the hotel was jointly developed by Sino-Ocean Land and Swire Properties. \nDesigned by internationally-renowned architects Make Architects, the 100-room hotel and its 42 adjoining serviced apartments form an integral part of the city government’s conservation project to preserve the surrounding heritage buildings next to the thousand-year-old Daci Temple. The three-dimensional woven façade combines modern design with the traditional Chengdu architectural elements of timber, brick and step stones. Elegant bamboo trees frame the hotel’s entrance, which is set in a beautifully restored hundred-year-old Chinese courtyard building first built in the Qing Dynasty. Although Chinese Emperors have previously stayed at the Daci Temple, The Temple House evokes the modest houses provided for scholars who came from different parts of the world to study at the Temple. The hotel continues this tradition of humility by creating understated luxury experiences that are founded on a deeply personalised service for every guest. The Temple House offers a dynamic collection of outlets including The Temple Café - the all-day dining restaurant, Tivano – an authentic Italian restaurant and Jing Bar featuring live DJs. Stylishly designed by AvroKo, all of the outlets are not just for guests; they are destination neighbourhood venues in their own right. Nestled in the renovated Chinese courtyard which was built nearly one hundred years ago, SPA Mi Xun is an urban oasis to unwind and relax. The gift shop and tea house at Mi Xun are designed to give guests the Mi Xun experience to take home and a post treatment space to enjoy a healthy lunch, tea or fresh juice. Brian Williams, Managing Director of Swire Hotels, comments: \"Our goal is to create a highly individualised hotel which houses a series of dynamic restaurants and uniquely designed facilities. The Temple House presents an ideal opportunity to extend our brand into one of China’s wealthiest and fastest-growing regions.\" Mark Passmore, General Manager of The Temple House, adds: \"The Temple House is a modern hotel that celebrates its historic location. We aim to provide discerning travellers with residential-style accommodation, where they can enjoy an authentic Chengdu experience.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T13:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T13:46:40.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
