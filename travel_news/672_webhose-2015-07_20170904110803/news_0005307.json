The four guys — a global skatepark salesman, a university marketing videographer, a high school teacher and soccer coach and advertising account director — plan to visit all 50 states in a week. They compared their trip to the expedition of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, who explored the northwestern United States in 1804-05. In that adventure, they had a guide, Sacagawea. For this trip, the adventurers said they will have Siri, an intelligent personal assistant and knowledge navigator on Apple iPhones, as a guide. “There’s tons of stuff we’re super excited for,” said Josh Willis, who will take turns driving with Brian Mehrens, Nate Williams and Chris Watson. Three of them were born and raised in Joplin, and two of them currently live there. Willis said when people learn of their travel plans, they ask them if they’ve lost their minds. “I say we’ve found destiny,” Willis said. “A lot of people say, ‘I want to live the American dream.’ Well, we’re driving it.” The foursome are partnering with Tipsy Elves, an American clothing design firm based in San Diego, California, that was featured on ABC’s show, “Shark Tank,” in 2013. Williams said he and his friends will be decked out in red, white and blue onesies made by the company. Also, Kodak donated five cameras, including three PIXPRO 360-degree cameras, that will be attached to their SUV to help record their journey. The group was scheduled to leave from Kittery, Maine, at midnight Saturday, and will drive through the lower 48 states to Washington state. From there, they will fly to Alaska and then fly to Hawaii, where they hope to arrive by Friday, July 17. Williams said the SUV is scheduled to cross the Kansas-Missouri border around 11 p.m. Sunday and could pass through Waynesville and Rolla around 5-6 a.m. Monday. To prove they made it to all 50 states, the group will stop and pose for a photo at the state signs. The group used Google Earth to locate the nearest state signs along their route as well as alternate sign locations in case the first one doesn’t pan out. Williams said about a year ago, someone posted on social media what was said to be the quickest route to visit all lower 48 states. “We thought we’d do it for kicks,” Williams said but they wanted to add Alaska and Hawaii to their itinerary. Page 2 of 2 - Williams said he learned that while some people have traveled to all lower 48 states in four to five days, according to the All 50 States Club, the record for someone visiting all 50 states is about eight days and 20 minutes. Williams said he hopes to finish this trip in six and a half days. Williams said the team has done several trips around the U.S. as well as traveled abroad. “Whatever trip we do, we want to make it ridiculous,” Williams said. The four friends traveled to South Africa for the World Cup, but they also made stops in Rome, Italy, and Egypt and even swam with sharks. The group also traveled to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, for Groundhog Day. Driving 20 hours a day will be one of the challenges the four men will face on their 13,000-mile journey, they agreed. The public can follow the team along online at 50states7days.com or tipsyelves.com/50states7days. People also can follow the group’s Facebook and Twitter pages.
