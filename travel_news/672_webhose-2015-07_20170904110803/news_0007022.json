He claims that the ANP senators in Islamabad have transferred their ‘discretionary’ funds for the said road upon his request. \nOn the other hand, Muqam claims that it was actually he who had convinced the National Highway Authority to sanction funds for the road. \nWhen contacted, Jaffer Shah was not available for comments however his cousin told this scribe that both Muqam and Shah hold their own inauguration ceremony in the presence of NHA authorities but the work is still pending on the road and thus this important project fall into politics of PML-N and Awami National Party. \nThe Tourism Department also failed to establish rest houses and revamp picnic points in Kumrat Valley of Upper Dir where eye-catching sights are available for tourists.
