The murals are fully respected,\" he adds, as he stands in one of the most impoverished areas of the municipality, in front of an impeccable mural of a red lighthouse.\nART3 and other government or non-government projects in the city want to fight vandalism with street art, thereby making residents more mindful of their surroundings and improving their quality of life.\n\"They're not just drawings. From the time we first started we always said it was something for people to participate in,\" says Silva of the district's 400 murals.\n- Capital of street art -\nIn Europe, despite some artists gaining international fame like Banksy, graffiti continues to be largely stigmatized and synonymous with vandalism.\nBut in Buenos Aires the opposite is true. The Argentine capital has become one of the world's centers of street art with thousands of murals decorating houses, schools and even churches.\nMuralists receive entire blocks or 25-meter-high facades to express themselves using oil or acrylic paint and aerosol spray.\nFestivals celebrate their work and some urban artists like Martin Ron or Fio Silva have been asked to paint abroad.\n\"The murals are here to surprise, to add pleasure, art, culture and joy to the public space,\" says Patricio di Stefano, the sub-secretary of public space for the city of Buenos Aires, which spends more than 60,000 dollars a year commissioning graffiti.\nGraffiti tour companies have also started to appear, showing tourists the city's great outdoor museum.\nSome murals feature local idols, like football star Carlos Tevez, whose face is famously painted across a building in Fuerte Apache, his poor Buenos Aires neighborhood.\nOther murals portray centaurs, giant eyes and various multicolored fictional creations coming straight out of the artists' imagination.\nFor tour company Graffitimundo member Cecilia Quiles, Buenos Aires' vibrant urban art scene is partly a reaction to Argentina's 1976 to 1983 military dictatorship.\n\"Buenos Aires is a city that has been scarred\", says Quiles about those years \"when public monuments were actively cleaned up and graffiti strongly repressed.\"\nToday, street art has given a new lease of life to Buenos Aires' walls, providing a new form of freedom of expression and improving the quality of life of some of its 10 million residents.\n© Provided by AFP Buenos Aires fights vandalism with street art ", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB74fLs.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;In", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAdhHUk.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AA5ZTIC&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;durationSecs&quot;:102,&quot;playbackUrl&quot;:&quot;http://www.msn.com/en-us/travel/news/in-a-room-no-bigger-than-a-small-classroom-it-recently-welcomed-a-17-year-old-boy-who-attended-for-the-first-time-he-said-he-stopped-going-to-the-catholic-church-several-years-ago-after-coming-out/vi-AAdcvui&quot;,&quot;providerId&quot;:&quot;AFPLifestyle_FRFR_doc-3k1blftp://microsoft-us-", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAdciwF.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AA5ZTIC&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;durationSecs&quot;:119,&quot;playbackUrl&quot;:&quot;http://www.msn.com/en-us/travel/news/children-here-grow-up-very-free-and-dream-of-confronting-danger-at-sea-like-their-fathers-did-its-hard-to-explain-they-should-stay-at-school-as-long-as-possible-he-added/vi-AAdaqMo&quot;,&quot;providerId&quot;:&quot;AFPLifestyle_FRFR_doc-3j7ctftp://microsoft-us-pull:u0d4mto8@ftp-clients.a", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAd9QyH.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAdtzrz.img&quot;}}", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;travelnews&quot;},&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&quot;,&quot;FWNetworkId&quot;:188286,&quot;FWServer&quot;:&quot;http://2df7e.v.fwmrm.net&quot;,&quot;HybridPlayerAdInitTim", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB74fLs.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;Children", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fAAdtiXt%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fAAdtord.img&description=Buenos+Aires+fights+vandalism+with+street+art+-+Provided+by+AFP"], "published": "2015-07-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T19:32:14.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
