They'll see knights in real armor battling with real weapons as well as stage entertainment and much more, said Daris Gibbons, aka Lady Bronwyn C Hawke. Gibbons is the festival's owner and executive producer.\nRELATED: 23 things to do this week around Arizona\nMesa resident Tina Talkington becomes Queen Julia del Castillo, who is always on the lookout for the band of pirates looking to make trouble for her.\nLast year, when Queen Julia walked the grounds with her granddaughter — a princess in the queen's court — handing out tiaras to little girls, they were pelted by a volley of marshmallows.\n\"The pirates had built a ship and they started shooting marshmallows at me,\" Talkington said. \"It was earlier in the day (and not hot) so the marshmallows did not stick on my clothes. Sometimes when I return to my throne, I see it's been altered. You have to be able to laugh at yourself. The pirates come up with good skits.\"\nAbout 3,000 people attended the fair last year. Visitors will find a kids corner, where children can play games and learn medieval skills. There will be drumming, belly dancing and musical shows on the main stage.\n\"Our knights display their skills each day ... and on Saturday they fight to the last knight standing for prizes made by our renowned armorist,\" Gibbons said. \"He and his students demonstrate their skills on site and sell not only armor but all kinds of metal art.\"\nArtisans and merchants will sell costumes, weapons, home decor, games, jewelry, candles, soaps and oils. Food, including the traditional turkey legs, and beverages also will be for sale.\nThe fair is a fundraiser for the non-profit 16th Century Renaissance Guild. Many of the members are from the East Valley.\nThe guild's mission is to entertain.\n\"We enjoy getting out of the digital world, away from cellphones and computers,\" Talkington said. \"It's a time when men were honorable. You can be anything from the queen to the peasant. It's an adult dress-up. And what young girl doesn't want to be a princess? It's your girlhood dream.\"\nMedieval Mayhem Renaissance Faire\nWhen: 10 a.m.-7 p.m. Friday-Saturday, July 10-11. 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Sunday, July 12.\nWhere: Mountain Meadow Recreation Complex, 1101 N. Woodland Road, Pinetop-Lakeside.\nAdmission: $10, $5 for ages 5-13.\nDetails: azmayhem.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T17:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T20:40:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
