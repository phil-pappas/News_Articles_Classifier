In the evening they will hear from DOC staff about conservation projects in Dusky Sound. \nDOC conservation services manager Fiordland Lindsay Wilson said DOC had a vision to make Dusky Sound one of the most intact ecosystems in the world. \n\"This joint venture between Real Journeys and DOC is a great way to show people first-hand some of the conservation work taking place in Dusky Sound to achieve that goal.\" \nThe cruise includes a visit to Pigeon Island to see Richard Henry's historic site and Pickersgill Harbour, where Captain Cook moored his ship Resolution and set up an astronomer's observatory to fix the longitude and latitude of the headland, in 1773. \nAll the elements of a Discovery Expedition on the Milford Wanderer would be included, Wilson said. \nThe trip leaves from Manapouri on September 3 and includes a helicopter flight from West Arm to Supper Cove, Dusky Sound. The $1300 price-tag is 30 per cent off the normal price for a similar trip.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T05:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T08:51:12.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
