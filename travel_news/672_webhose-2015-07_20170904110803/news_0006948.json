That's because they are paying about a buck less per gallon for jet fuel this summer — savings that totalled nearly $1 billion for United compared with last summer.\nSouthwest Airlines Co. earned a record $608 million in the second quarter — a 31 per cent increase from a year ago, and the airline's ninth straight record-profit quarter. United Continental Holdings Inc. posted a record $1.2 billion profit.\nBoth airlines announced they were passing some of the gains to investors by buying back some of their own stock, which makes the remaining shares more valuable. United announced a $3 billion buyback plan, while Southwest said it would spend up to $500 million.\nBoth carriers also reported that passengers are seeing slightly lower fares.\nGovernment figures indicate that U.S. airfares have risen faster than inflation for five straight years, but that string might end in 2015.\nSouthwest said its average one-way fare for the first part of summer was down 3 per cent from last summer, a savings of more than $5. Partly that's because of Dallas, where a change in federal law has led to a boom in new flights and ignited a fare war.\nUnited didn't report its average fare, but it noted that revenue for every seat flown one mile — a proxy for ticket prices — dropped 5.6 per cent. United executives blamed weakness in Houston, an energy centre that has been hurt by lower oil prices, and in Chicago and Dallas.\nAirfares were rising when airlines held the supply of flights and seats nearly unchanged despite a steadily growing economy. Last month, the Justice Department began investigating whether United, Southwest, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines worked together to limit seats, a potential violation of antitrust laws. The airlines deny wrongdoing.\nSouthwest is growing now. It expects to increase passenger-carrying capacity about 7 per cent this year and 5 to 6 per cent next year.\n\"We have not grown Southwest Airlines in three or four years,\" but now \"we have opportunities to grow like we haven't had in years,\" CEO Gary Kelly said, citing Dallas and Houston. \"We absolutely will grow this airline.\"\nThat growth worries investors because it could further erode prices. United expects revenue per seat mile to decline between 5 and 7 per cent in the third quarter; Delta predicted a drop of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent, while Southwest is less bearish, predicting a 1 per cent decline.\nAnalysts like Jim Corridore of S&P Capital IQ said they expect airlines will cut flights to shore up prices.\nDallas-based Southwest reported that a second-quarter profit, excluding one-time items like bonuses for employees who ratified union contracts, that slightly beat a forecast from analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research. Revenue rose just 2 per cent to $5.11 billion, but Southwest saved $420 million or 29 per cent on jet fuel.\nUnited's revenue fell 4 per cent to $9.91 billion and was less than analysts predicted. Still, thanks to those fuel savings the Chicago-based company reported a 51 per cent increase in profit that beat expectations.\nAlaska Air Group Inc., the parent of Alaska Airlines, reported net income rose 42 per cent to $234 million. Excluding one-time amounts, the adjusted profit of $230 million was a record for the Seattle-based company.\nIn afternoon trading, shares of Southwest rose $1.41, or 4 per cent, to $36.53; United Continental slipped 53 cents to $56.54; and Alaska dropped $2.26, or 3.3 per cent, to $73.57.\n___\nDavid Koenig can be reached at http://twitter.com/airlinewriter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T01:48:55.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
