Ad Feedback \n\"A small bad tax is still a bad tax. It is an unwelcome signal being sent by the Government that it is willing to impose risks on efforts to grow the value of the visitor economy, contrary to the goals of its own Business Growth Agenda,\" he said. \nAny move that discouraged travel could \"impact on the economics of airline services and adversely impact on air connectivity\", the coalition said in a statement. \nIf the levy was introduced, it should not be subject to GST, and a \"traveller reference group\" should be set up to monitor how the raised funds were spent, it said. \nRoberts said the levy had been proposed in haste and without any consultation. \nRegulatory Reform Minister Steven Joyce said in a separate statement on Tuesday that the Government intended to take a more collaborative approach to government regulation. \nResponding to a Productivity Commission report, he said the Government wanted \"a more productive and collaborative approach between regulators and their stakeholders\". \n\"We want to use more open book exercises and more exposure drafts, to in effect crowd-source improvements to regulations,\" he said. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T03:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T03:43:11.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
