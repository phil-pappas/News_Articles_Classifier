The Millennial Effect Controversy! Date: Tuesday, July 28 Time: 11:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. Location: 311CD When it comes to those in the workforce born after 1980 - collectively referred to as \"Millennials\" - is there a direct correlation between age and compliance to travel programs? Millennials currently make up approximately one-third of today's workforce - and within a few years that number is expected to exceed 50 percent. The panel will explore how a variety of companies are changing their approach to this audience - from offering new incentives to updating communication strategies to investing in consumerized and mobile technologies. Walton will lead the discussion with Carly Jones, senior manager of global travel and events at David's Bridal, Jennifer Nguyen, recruiting operations at Box, and Greg Rackett, procurement manager at Navigant. It's a Mobile, Mobile World After All Date: Tuesday, July 28 Time: 11:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. Location: 314AB Razza will moderate a discussion on mobile apps and their growing use in the business travel experience.

Participants will be inspired by what's available and equipped to make recommendations to their travelers, from planning and booking through the travel experience and closing the loop when upon return. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T16:12:15.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
