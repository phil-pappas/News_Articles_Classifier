PUBLISHED: 00:00, Tue, Jul 7, 2015 | UPDATED: 20:30, Tue, Jul 7, 2015 GETTY Historic Havana has been off limits to American tourists for more than 50 years The historic development came in an announcement by Carnival Corporation's CEO Arnold Donald, who said the company's new Fathom brand, for pioneering social impact travel, will lead the way. P&O Cruises's Adonia will be redeployed to Fathom after its March 2016 Caribbean & Amazon cruise. It starts seven-day trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic from April 2016, then in May it will sail from Miami to Cuba every other week. These licences today are historic. It is the first time in well over 50 years that a cruise ship can take passengers from the US to Cuba Carnival Corporation's CEO Arnold Donald The 710-passenger ship is small enough to dock at Havana's modest passenger terminal, and will call at two other ports in Cuba during its cruise around the island. Commercial travel between the United States and Cuba has been banned since 1960, following the Communist revolution in 1958. Tensions eased at the end of last year when President Obama announced plans to normalise relations between the two countries. The US President also met with Cuban President Raul Castro in April at the Summit of the Americas in Panama. Bookings for the Cuba cruises are already being taken, although agreements with the Cuban government are still to be ironed out, and the form of cruises on offer must be within the \"12 authorised forms of travel\" permitted by the US government. Mr Donald said: \"Today, none of our brands can go to Cuba because we are US-based and by US law we are not allowed to go, so these licences today are historic. It is the first time in well over 50 years that a cruise ship can take passengers from the US to Cuba.\" PH/GETTY Cruise firm boss Arnold Donald announced today the new cruises to Havana He added that once travel restrictions were fully lifted Carnival Corporation would want to have general leisure cruises to Cuba, as well as the immersive cultural tours that the company has been given a licence to provide. \"We are looking forward to that day, as is everybody else in the cruise industry,\" he said. Booking for the Dominican Republic immersive cruises began in June, and well over three billion website impressions have already been made. \"Today we have already begun reserving for Cuba,\" said Tara Russell, president of Fathom.
