The city is known for its beauty, great cuisine, and left-wing politics - home to the former Italian communist party and its newspaper, L'Unita . \nBologna Location: \nBologna is the capital of the Emilia-Romagna region in northern Italy. It's less than an hour inland from the east coast and about halfway between Florence and Milan. See Emilia-Romagna Map . Bologna can be visited any time of the year although it may be pretty cold in winter and hot in summer. For more about when to go, see Bologna Travel Weather \nGetting to Bologna: \nBologna is a main transportation hub for several train lines with easy access to Milan, Venice, Florence, Rome, and both coasts. The historic center is a short walk from the train station but you can also take a bus. Most of the compact historic center is closed to traffic and is great for walking. There is good public transportation within the city and a small airport outside Bologna (see Italy Airports Map ). \nWhere to Stay: \nFind places to stay with these top-rated Bologna hotels or search for Bologna hotels on Hipmunk . \nFood Specialties: \nHandmade egg pasta and stuffed pasta, especially tortellini , are specialties of Bologna and of course, there is the famous pasta bolognese , tagliatelle with ragu (a long cooked meat sauce).

If you'd like to take a cooking class, Passionate about Pasta includes a market tour, pasta making, and lunch. \nWhat to See and Do: Bologna's compact medieval center has several beautiful churches, monuments, and civic buildings. Its many porticoed sidewalks make for pleasant walking and window shopping. Piazza Maggiore is one of the central squares, lined with arcades. It's a good place to sit at an outdoor cafe. Around the square are the Gothic Basilica of San Petronio , the Palazzo dei Notai , and the Archeological Museum. Piazza del Nettuno , next to Piazza Maggiore , another of Bologna's main squares, has an ornate 16th-century fountain in the center and is surrounded by medieval civic buildings. Go inside the library and admire its beautiful interior. Via Clavatura , east of the squares, has a number of small, interesting food stalls. You can climb the steep staircase to the top of Torre degli Asinelli , one of only a few surviving medieval towers, for a great view of Bologna. Torre degli Asinelli and another leaning tower are in Piazza Porta Ravegnana where seven medieval streets converge. In Piazza Santo Stefano you will find an unusual cluster of four interlocking Romanesque churches. The oldest, the church of SS. Vitale e Agricola , has parts of Roman temples and columns. There is also an interesting courtyard with a maze of little chapels. The Pinacoteca Nazionale is one of Italy's best galleries with several important works of art. The University, one of Europe's oldest, is worth a visit. Palazzo Poggi has two interesting museums. Sometimes you will see student demonstrations or lively graduation celebrations.

The ox is decorated from horns to tail with flowers and ribbons and there's a procession that ends just before midnight in Piazza San Petronio, followed by fireworks.
