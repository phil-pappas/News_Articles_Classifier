Xanthe Clay The spread was lavish: utterly amazing cakes; really good sandwiches, filled and cut to perfection; bread from the local bakery; beef from the local butcher, cooked to rosy perfection; wonderful honey-cooked ham. The hummingbird cake really was award-winning – very moist with heaps of flavour, slightly nubbly, with nuts and tiny pieces of pineapple. With that icing it is delicious, sugar heaven. Gareth A Davies It was delicious. I had a plate of savoury food – pork pie, haslet – which I loved, and then I went back for the beautifully cut sandwiches, followed by an array of cakes that were all just baked and prepared to perfection.
