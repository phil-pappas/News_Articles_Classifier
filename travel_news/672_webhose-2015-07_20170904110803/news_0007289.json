The blueprint is for a stable Asian monetary system, an investment financing system, and a unified credit system, including the opening of Asian bond and stock markets, said Xu Xiujun, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences’ Institute of World Economics and Politics . It has been hoped that a well-designed financial framework can connect countries along the Belt and Road Initiative to jointly raise funds for infrastructure construction, given that the Asian Development Bank had estimated an $8 trillion gap in infrastructure financing in developing Asian nations between 2014 and 2020. The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is a breakthrough as a creative multilateral financial mechanism in the region The Belt and Road Initiative, aimed at creating a Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, was first introduced as a concept by Chinese President Xi Jinping during visits to Kazakhstan and Indonesia in 2013. According to the government’s plan, the economic belt would link China with Europe through central and western parts of Asia via a network of highways, railways and other infrastructure. The maritime road would connect China with Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe by expanding ports and coastal infrastructure. “The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is a breakthrough as a creative multilateral financial mechanism in the region, and it will effectively lead the deposits from high-savings Asian countries to support infrastructure construction,” Mr Xu said. An official signing ceremony to establish the bank’s operational framework, attended by representatives of the 57 nations that applied to be founding members, took place in Beijing on June 29. Jin Liqun, formerly with the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, has been nominated to head the bank. Liu Yue, a researcher with the National Development and Reform Commission , the country’s top economic planner, said the AIIB was expected to focus on bond financing. “Its tools may include the traditional loan and credit assurance,” he said. “It can raise capital from the interbank offered credit, issuing sovereign bonds of the funding members, or absorb private capital under the public-private partnership programme.” The AIIB will have an authorised capital of $100 billion (£64 billion). China would be the bank’s largest shareholder with a subscribed capital of $29.78 billion, or a current 30.34 per cent stake. China will also have 26.06 per cent of the votes. Its tools may include the traditional loan and credit assurance Dirk Willem te Velde, the head of the International Economic Development Group in Britain, said the bank “will easily obtain an AAA bond rating, which would allow it to borrow more cheaply and therefore give it a larger portfolio, as it managed to absorb 16 of the world’s 20 largest economies as shareholders”. The $40 billion Silk Road Fund, which was established in December, would be another important financial institution, focusing on direct equity investment along the belt and road routes, said Mr Liu at the NDRC. “The function of the SRF will be different from the AIIB, but they are complementary,” he said. ”The fund will mainly use domestic capital, especially foreign exchange reserves, to invest in medium and long-term projects through holding companies’ shares.” The function of the SRF will be different from the AIIB, but they are complementary The fund could also absorb foreign investors into its sub-funds to jointly develop projects on a multilateral platform, he added. Jin Qi, chairman of the SRF, said in June that the fund was looking for high-return projects and that the operation would follow market-oriented rules, which was different from policy and development assistance financial institutions. The fund announced initial capital of $10 billion: $1.5 billion from China’s sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp, $6.5 billion from the foreign exchange reserves, $1.5 billion from the Export-Import Bank of China and another $500 million from the China Development Bank . ... a direct connection between Chinese capital and the economy in those countries In April, the fund invested in its first project: The Karot Hydropower Project on the Jhelum River in north east Pakistan. Zhang Hongli, vice-president of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, has suggested the establishment of an offshore stock exchange, or “international board”, to allow IPOs by companies from countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative. “If so, that will be a direct connection between Chinese capital and the economy in those countries,” he said, adding that the board could be opened in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone or Shenzhen Qianhai Special Economic Zone. The move would be a creative measure to open up the capital market in the region and allow Chinese capital to support construction in those countries, he added. Q&A: Lender will reinforce regional ties Shi Yaobin, China’s deputy minister of finance, held a news briefing on the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank on June 29. Here are some highlights. When will the AIIB begin to admit new members? The AIIB will not admit new members until the bank is formally established and its board of governors is set up. A special majority vote within the board will be needed to admit a new member, meaning an affirmative vote of at least 50 per cent of board members, and no less than 50 per cent of the voting rights the members represent. The AIIB will stick to the principles of inclusiveness and openness. The membership will be open to members of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Asian Development Bank, which includes the United States and Japan. How do you view the present veto power held by China? China has a 30.34 per cent share in the bank and 26.06 per cent of the total votes in the institution. That means China is not only the largest shareholder, but also wields the biggest voting rights. As more new members join, shares and total votes of all the members, including China, will be diluted. China will hold less sway in the institution. What can China gain from the initiative? From an economic development perspective, the benefits are self-evident. A multilateral development bank can mobilise and deploy regional and non-regional resources, including capital, human resources and project finance, to places where they are most urgently needed. This investment is likely to be spread across the whole region, and will be facilitated in a co-ordinated way. That is much better than the other scenario, in which each nation builds its own projects. From an economic order perspective, the core value of a market economy is free competition. As a new multilateral development bank, the AIIB can contribute to the goals of mutual competition and mutual effort. Why is there a need for the AIIB, since there is already the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank? The existing multilateral development banks are far from satisfying the region’s huge demands. If the World Bank could handle everything there would be no need for others. Look at it this way: In China, we have the Big Five banks, so why are we advocating many more banks? Because the Big Five are not enough. What is the relationship between the AIIB and the Belt and Road Initiative? The AIIB is not set up exclusively for the Belt and Road Initiative. They are two separate initiatives. But if there are appropriate projects along the belt and road, the AIIB could fund them. The AIIB: from inception to fruition Formation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank - a timeline 2013 October 2 President Xi Jinping proposed the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to promote connectivity and economic integration in Asia. 2014 April 10 Premier Li Keqiang announced at the Boao Forum that China was ready to “intensify consultations on the preparations for the AIIB”. Jin Liqun, former chairman of investment bank China International Capital Corp and vice-president of the Asian Development Bank, was appointed secretary-general of a multilateral interim secretariat for establishing the AIIB. October 24 The first batch of 22 prospective founding members, including China, India and Singapore, signed a memorandum of understanding on establishing the AIIB in Beijing. November 24 Indonesia became the latest member of ASEAN to sign up to the AIIB. 2015 March 12 Britain confirmed with China that it would apply to join the AIIB as a founding member. Britain was the first of the G7 leading economies to join. March 31 It was announced that 57 countries had joined or applied to join the AIIB as prospective founding members. Thirty-seven were classed as intra-regional members, entitled to the bulk of the shares in the bank, while the other 20 were non-regional members. A chief negotiators’ meeting was convened to negotiate the bank’s articles of association, and a multilateral interim secretariat was established to provide technical support. Five rounds of talks were held and a consensus was reached on the AIIB’s purpose, membership, capital subscription, voting powers, operations and governance. June 29 The 57 members signed the articles of association in Beijing. The articles were to be submitted to each nation’s legislature for approval, with a view to establishing the bank this year. July 6 China nominated Jin Liqun, secretary general of the multilateral interim secretariat for establishing the AIIB, as a candidate for president of the AIIB.
