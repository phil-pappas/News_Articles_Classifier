We take it [the UK] very seriously, and we’re investing a lot of money in the UK.” \nThe investment will specifically be in marketing, Stuart said. “Most marketing has been to travel agents up to now, and it’s been up to them to then tell their customers. We want to do a better job of marketing to the consumer.” \nStuart ruled out television advertising, which he said was unlikely “in the first instance”, although he added: “We wouldn’t rule out digital advertising and direct mail – taking some of the learnings from [newly acquired sister brand] Prestige which does this very well. \n“We’ll also look at newspaper advertising in those it makes sense for.” Stuart was also quick to reassure the trade that any direct marketing would not be designed to undercut agents. \n“This is good news for agents,” he stressed. “We won’t do anything that doesn’t have ‘contact your travel agent on’. The vast majority of our business still comes through the trade – more than 90% is from agents, and we absolutely don’t see that changing.” \nThe renewed focus on the UK market comes despite the company moving its headquarters from London to Southampton, which Stuart admitted had resulted in a number of people leaving Norwegian. “Our lease in London was expiring, and London rent is very expensive,” he explained. \n“Given that we had just acquired Prestige, the obvious thing was to look at merging our offices, and Southampton is where Prestige has their headquarters, so it made sense. There are things that we can learn from each other.” \nThe two companies are now on the same campus, Stuart said, but in separate office buildings. \n“We tried to do everything we could to get everyone to move with us, and the vast majority of the senior team did, but we lost a fair few people that we would really liked to have retain,” he admitted. “But people have lives, and some of them just weren’t able to relocate.” \nHe insisted that all the vacant roles would be filled, and that the line was now on a recruitment drive. “We are a growing business in the UK,” he added, “we will ultimately have a bigger team in the UK.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T12:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T12:07:46.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
