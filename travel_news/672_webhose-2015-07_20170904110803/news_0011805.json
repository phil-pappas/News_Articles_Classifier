Other items including ice creams, snacks and bottles of wine and water brought the overall price to £233.03. \nEven those who stay in resort often found themselves shelling out for more with close to two in five spending an average of £43 on international brands of alcohol, a third spent £44 on bottles of wine, 37% almost £27 on bottled water and three in 10 paid £41 extra on cocktails. \nAndrew Brown, head of Post Office Travel Money, said: “Over the past four years our annual research has consistently shown that European all inclusive resorts offer less than holidaymakers expect so it is important for families to be aware of what is included in their package to avoid getting caught out. \n“If you have already booked an all inclusive holiday, budget carefully and allow for the extra costs you are likely to incur. \n“On the plus side, the powerful pound means that all inclusive holidaymakers who want to get a real flavour of their holiday destination can eat and drink in local restaurants and bars more cheaply this year. \n“However, it is best to be prepared and take enough foreign currency to cover the extra cost of items bought outside the All Inclusive resort – particularly as some restaurants are reluctant to accept credit or debit cards.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T14:22:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
