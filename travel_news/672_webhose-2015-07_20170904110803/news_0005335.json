Hayes Presidential Center By BOB DOWNING Akron Beacon Journal July 13, 2015 Updated 22 hours ago 2015-07-13T12:12:39Z Order a reprint of this story \nFREMONT, Ohio â€” Rutherford B. Hayes can't get any respect, even in his own house. \nThe third-graders from Huron schools were clearly more impressed with photos and sculptures of Abraham Lincoln than they were with items belonging to Hayes, the 19th president of the United States. \nHe is the star at the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center in Fremont in northwest Ohio, with the 31-room Hayes House and the adjoining Hayes Museum/Library. \nHayes (1822-1893) and his wife, Lucy, are buried on the grounds of the 25-acre Spiegel Grove estate. They were moved there in 1915. \nAlso buried on the grounds is Hayes' war horse, Old Whitey, that died in 1879. \nHayes was a lawyer, Civil War officer, Ohio congressman, Ohio governor and U.S. president from 1877 to 1881. \nHe graduated from Ohio's Kenyon College in 1842 and Harvard Law School in 1845. He began his law career in Lower Sandusky (now Fremont) and married Lucy Ware Webb of Chillicothe in 1852. She was the first presidential wife to be a college graduate (Cincinnati's Wesleyan Female College). They had eight children, although three died as infants. \nHayes, nicknamed \"Rud,\" served as Cincinnati city solicitor from 1858-1861. When the Civil War started, he was appointed a major in the 23rd Ohio Volunteer Infantry. He fought largely in West Virginia and the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. \nHe was severely wounded in 1862 at the Battle of South Mountain. He had four horses shot out from under him and he was wounded five times. \nIn 1864, while still in the Army, Hayes was elected to Congress despite his refusal to campaign. \nHe did not take his seat until the war ended. He was re-elected in 1866. The following year, he was elected governor. He retired at the end of his second gubernatorial term in 1872, but was returned to office in 1875. \nHe was chosen the Republican presidential nominee and won the 1876 election, but only after a special commission decided the outcome of 20 disputed electoral votes and he beat Democrat Samuel Tilden of New York by one electoral vote. It has been called the most complex U.S. presidential election ever. \nAs president, Hayes withdrew the last federal troops still in the South, after Congress refused to provide adequate funds and after Southern leaders pledged to protect the rights of freed slaves. He also initiated civil service reform to end patronage jobs. \nHe was the first president to travel to the West Coast, and to have a telephone and a typewriter in the White House. \nHe honored an election promise and did not seek a second term, retiring to Spiegel Grove. \nHis house is very impressive, in large part because it is filled with Hayes' items, furnishings and family mementos. It is a National Historic Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. \nIt encompasses 10,000 square feet of space after multiple additions over the years. The house had been initially built from 1859 to 1863 as a Gothic farmhouse with 4,000 square feet of space by Hayes' uncle, Sardis Birchard. It was large but simple with eight bedrooms, and was to be the family's summer retreat. \nSpiegel Grove was named for the German word for mirror, after the reflective waters that collected during showers. \nBirchard bought 50 pigs to raise and started a general store. He never married and envisioned Hayes and his family living with him in his retirement. \nAfter four expansions, the house had grown into a Victorian mansion with 31 rooms including 18 bedrooms. There are 15 fireplaces. The exterior is brick with very little ornamentation. It got electricity in 1915 and an elevator in 1933. \nFour generations of the Hayes family lived in the house. \nTOURING HOUSE \nIt is only open to guided tours, covering parts of the first and second floors. The third and fourth floors are not open to tourists. Those floors have more bedrooms and an attic used for storage. Interestingly, the rooms on the upper levels are named. \nPerhaps the most distinctive feature of Hayes' house is the central staircase of butternut and black walnut with 57 steps. It is a 45-foot climb to the fourth floor. \nThe tour includes stops in the parlor, Hayes' bedroom and bath, the library with its 13-foot-high ceilings and dining room. The library is dominated by a bigger-than-life painting of Hayes by artist William Carl Brown. It contains old books, but Hayes' own books are actually next door in the museum. \nSeveral bedrooms on the second floor are also open. On that floor are 12 glass-lined wooden cases where Hayes could display special gifts. He called the cases his Little Smithsonian, said tour guide Bill Pearce. \nThe oldest piece of furniture in the Hayes house is a 1779 clock that Rutherford and Lucy got as a wedding gift. Among the more unusual furniture items is a chair made of 12 cattle horns, made in 1879 in Kansas. \nLOVE OF PORCH, NATURE \nHayes, who was something of a pack rat, loved his front porch. It was 15 feet wide and on rainy days he could circle the house on his porch. It was 33 laps to cover one mile. In fact, Hayes was famously said to want a veranda with a house attached. \nHe typically walked six miles a day. He was also an avid reader and in retirement typically spent six hours a day in the library reading and writing letters. \nHayes was evidently an early tree hugger. He asked famous visitors to hug or place a hand on a tree on the grounds of Spiegel Grove, and that was marked by a small plaque attached to the tree. \nAnd that tradition continued even after Hayes' death. \nTree huggers/touchers included five other U.S. presidents: William McKinley, James A. Garfield, William Howard Taft, Warren Harding and Grover Cleveland, as well as Civil War generals Phillip Sheridan and William S. Rosecrans. \nTHOUSANDS VISIT EACH YEAR \nThe house opened to the public in 1966. \nThe Presidential Center was the nation's first presidential library. It opened to the public in 1916. It is part of the museum building. \nYou can tour the museum filled with Hayes' memorabilia at your leisure. The nonfederal center gets about 32,000 visitors a year. \nHouse and museum hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday and noon to 5 p.m. Sunday and holidays. The library is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. \nThe center is less than an hour's drive from Cedar Point. It is 60 miles west of Cleveland and a two-hour drive from Akron. \nThe main entrance is at the corner of Hayes and Buckland avenues. The entrance is marked by the gates that stood at the White House while Hayes was president. They were donated in 1928. \nAdult admission is $7.50 for the house or the museum, $13 for both. For senior citizens, the admission is $6.50 for one, $12 for both. For children 6 to 12, the single admission is $3, $5 for both. \nFor more information, call 800-998-PRES or 419-332-2081, or see www.rbhayes.org.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T13:10:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
