Time to get aboard 13th Jul 2015 12:00 AM Kate Fisher: The new cruise ship Ovation of the Seas will turn the industry on its head. Related Items Cars For Sale \nKATE Fisher from Flight Centre Sydney Street Markets has plenty to love about her job. \n\"I get a real buzz when my clients come into the store after a holiday I've booked for them. I love the feedback after they've returned from a new destination or set sail on a cruise for the first time,\" Kate said. \nKate's earliest experience on the high seas was a New Year's Eve cruise to the South Pacific onboard Radiance of the Seas, later followed by a two-week journey around New Zealand on the Voyager of the Seas. \n\"I can't rave about Royal Caribbean enough; both ships were just incredible. I couldn't believe I could go ice-skating at sea. There wasn't enough time to do everything onboard,\" she said. \nAs for the future of cruising, Kate said the new Ovation of the Seas, regarded as the world's most advanced cruise ship, would turn the industry on its head when it lands in Sydney in December 2016. \n\"The new ship is going to be absolutely amazing. We've already had a lot of interest in store,\" she said. \n\"The dizzying variety of activities onboard will be beyond compare, from the SeaPlex entertainment centre to the iFly skydiving deck and Jamie's Italian restaurant to wi-fi.\" \nFor your next holiday call Flight Centre on 1300772571. cruise", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T04:14:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
