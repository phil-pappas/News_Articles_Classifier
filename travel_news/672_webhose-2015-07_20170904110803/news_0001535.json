Altstadt (Old Town) \nThe heart of Düsseldorf lies in its Altstadt (Old Town). Set between the shopping boulevard Königsallee and the river Rhine, the Altstadt is the perfect starting point to explore and to get a feeling for the city. Stroll through cobble-stoned streets, duck into some quiet churches, and have an Alt beer in one of the traditional brewery pubs. Highlights of the Old Town include the Burgplatz square with its old palace tower; Bolkerstrasse filled with Rhenish and international restaurants; and Düsseldorf’s landmark, the statue of Elector Jan Wellem in front of the beautiful City Hall. Birge Amondson, licensed to about.com 2. Media Harbour \nDüsseldorf’s former industrial harbor has been turned into a playground for contemporary architects such as David Chipperfield or Claude Vasconi; the post-modern buildings, most notably Frank O. Gehry’s three twisted houses, stand in an interesting contrast to old elements such as historic warehouses, quay walls, and wrought-iron railings. Besides media companies, fashion and design studios, you’ll find some hip restaurants and bars here. © Düsseldorf Marketing & Tourismus GmbH 3. Rhine River Promenade \nTo get from the Old Town to the new Media Harbor, I recommend you walk along the paved Rhine river promenade. On weekends, the street, which was banned for cars a couple of years ago, is filled with walkers, bikers, and strollers. Along the way, you’ll find the interesting art gallery Kunst im Tunnel , as well as the 565 feet high Rhine Tower, which offers wonderful views of the city and its surroundings.

But even if you are not that much not into shopping, the “Kö”, as locals call this street, is worth a visit. Parallel to the boulevard runs a canal lined with chestnut trees - perfect for a serene walk. Birge Amondson licensed to about.com 5. Art Museums \nDüsseldorf is home to the well-known Kunstakademie (art academy), which is an integral part of the city's art scene and graduated the likes of Joseph Beuys, Jörg Immendorff, and Gerhard Richter. Naturally, there is no shortage of world-class galleries and museums; check out the Kunsthalle for contemporary art exhibitions, the Museum Kunstpalast for fine arts from Classical antiquity to the present, the K20 gallery, which focuses on art of the 20th century, or K21, the city’s premier museum for art after 1980, just to name a few.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T03:22:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
