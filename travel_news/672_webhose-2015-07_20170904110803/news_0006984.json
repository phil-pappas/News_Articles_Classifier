Less is more. Less is more. \nI have to chant this as a mantra a few times before it starts to sink in. I seem to be a magnet for not only things but also experiences - gobbling up both in order to keep things alive and moving. Ah, but that is the irony: a life packed with objects and activities actually slows me down. Big time. \nWhen I first became an entrepreneur, sticky notes were on every flat surface in my home and car. I met with so many people I could barely remember my own name. I was adrift in an endless sea of opportunities, connections, and partnerships. It was impossible to stay prioritized and selective with my time. My life and mind quickly became, well, a mess . \nThen I discovered The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up by Marie Kondo, a small book on the Japanese art of decluttering and organizing that has already sold 2 million copies. This is not the standard \"neurotic-perfectionist-with-OCD-tendencies-illustrates-just-how-far-I-am-from-remotely-achieving-an-organized-life\" declutter book. \nTidying Up is almost spiritual - a perspective on keeping house that reaches far beyond the physical environment. It's not just a method, but a worldview that cultivates deep personal insight and real resilience in all areas of life - especially business. \nThe KonMari Method presented in Tidying Up really is life-changing because it allows room for clarity around who I am and what I want, and that's the secret sauce to becoming an inspired leader. So out go the bags and bags of clutter from my home and office. And it feels good ! Thinking about giving it a try? Here's 5 reasons you (and your business) will be glad you did. KonMari Tip #1: \"When your room is clean and uncluttered, you have no choice but to examine your inner state.\" I notice that the more clutter I have in my life and business, the more it distracts me from my greatest power source: ME. When clutter sprawls out of control, it captures more and more of my attention until I am spending way too much time managing my space. I feel heavy, distracted and completely disconnected from my intuition and inner wisdom. All that noise makes me lose my way as I become reactive to the clutter rather than proactive with my deepest vision.\nBusiness Tip: Staying connected to your inner knowing is easier when your life and mind are free of clutter. KonMari Tip #2: \"There are 3 approaches we can take toward our possessions: Face them now, face them sometime, or avoid them until the day we die.\" Still hanging on to letters from high school boyfriends, a gazillion drawings from your kids, or papers from business school that you will NEVER refer back to? I do it, too. I accumulate stashes of old baby stuff that might come in handy when I'm a grandparent (my kids are 8 and 5!), endless computer wires and electronic equipment that might magically become useful again at some point, and countless clothes that are a few sizes too small for when I get back into that \"skinny\" phase.\nAccording to KonMari, people hang on to their stuff because they are either still attached to the past or they have a fear of the future -- or both. Getting rid of the things that don't serve me keeps me in the present moment by letting me process my past and move on into my future. \nBusiness Tip: Don't hang on to your mistakes - thank them and move on. Staying streamlined in this way allows you to pivot easily and efficiently through the ups and downs of entrepreneurship. KonMari Tip #3: \"The question of what you want to own is actually the question of how you want to live your life.\" For so long women have forced our desires out of our bodies and minds in the name of serving others. As we begin to understand that there is room for both service and our desires, getting clear on what we want has never been more important.\nWhat I love about Marie's approach is that she doesn't make tidying the end game of life. She may be a tiny bit obsessive (her \"shock\" at seeing socks tucked into themselves made me wonder), but she knows that a tidy house is a means to a more important end. \"The true goal should be to establish the lifestyle you want most once your house has been put in order,\" she says. My read: If you are searching for your purpose in life - throw some shit out! \nBusiness Tip: Discarding what is not working for you in your business life allows your vision to become more clear. KonMari Tip #4: \"Selecting and discarding one's possessions is a continuous process of making decisions based on one's own values.\" The act of tidying up your physical space is actually thousands of micro decisions about how you want to live your life. The golden questions: Does this make you happy? Does it bring you joy? When you continuously make decisions based on this criteria, you get better and better at surrounding yourself with things that reflects your desires and values.\nI am one month into the process (she says that it takes 6 months for your entire living space), and I am already noticing a difference not only in my home, but in all areas of my life and business. \nBusiness Tip: Making decisions on what to keep and discard in your life builds confidence and aptitude for making decisions in your business. KonMari Tip #5: \"The process of assessing how you feel about the things you own, identifying those that have fulfilled their purpose, expressing your gratitude, and bidding them farewell, is really about examining your inner self, a rite of passage to a new life.\" Finally, what I love best about Marie's approach is that she encourages me to thank all of the items that I throw away. So I do! I thank them for their service before sending them on their way. This helps to punctuate the transition to a life more in line with what I really want.\nI use the same approach in my business with all of the \"mistakes\" I have made along the way. Instead of hanging on and over-processing a failure, I thank the experience for its tenure in my life, and free myself to focus on what is going right. \nBusiness Tip: Appreciate where you are now and all of the events (good and bad) that have led you to this point. Gratitude for your more challenging experiences makes you a better leader without all of that bulky psychological baggage holding you back. \nFor me, the way back to my inner wisdom is to turn off the noise, get rid of the clutter and give myself the gift of less. \nDoes the KonMari Method work for you? How do you bring these principles to your life? \nFollow Chantal Pierrat on Twitter: www.twitter.com/emergingW More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T18:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T23:12:01.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
