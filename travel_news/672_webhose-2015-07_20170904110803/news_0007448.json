Kyle Carpenter at a gala to raise funds for exhibitions. The museum said Tuesday that it will honor individuals whose portraits are in the museum's collection with the new Portrait of a Nation Prize. The awards will be presented at the museum's American Portrait Gala on Nov. 15. The Smithsonian gallery aims to raise $1 million at the event to establish an endowment for future exhibitions. Museum Director Kim Sajet says the five honorees are history makers and exemplars in their fields. She says the museum works continually to build its collection to highlight American achievements. Philanthropists Wayne and Catherine Reynolds are the gala's founding chairs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T00:40:53.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
