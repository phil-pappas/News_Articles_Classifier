The Frenchman, who has been criticised for his role at the helm of the central bank during Ireland's debt crisis, told Reuters: \"If Greece really wants to have a deal, it has all the capacity to get it\". \"If there is no deal, it would be a Greek decision.\" \"It would be a terrible catastrophe for the Greek people itself. You'd have an implosion of the economy, you have further, very large contraction of the GDP, and a dramatic increase in unemployment and a fall in the standard of living.\" The former ECB head also said a Greek exit would deal a blow to the credibility of the European project and add to geopolitical risks at a time of instability in neighbouring regions, citing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. \"Together with the geopolitical risk you'd have a certain loss of credibility of Europe. The authority and the influence of Europe will suffer.\" 17.34 Creditors deal with Greek loan request Athens' submission for a new bail-out has been sent to its creditors. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem has now passed it on to his fellow creditor institutions of the Commission and the ECB. Finance ministers were not due to hold a discussion over the plans today, but Reuters are now reporting this could still well happen later today.

This keeps the ELA ceiling at €89bn. Earlier this week, the bank decided to tighten its lending rules on ELA, making banks take a larger haircut on the collateral they swap in return for the loans. That was widely seen as a form of political signalling from the ECB, rather than a drastic move with dire consequences for the struggling banks. Today's decision will still however keep the squeeze on the country's financial system. The Greek government said ealier today, its bank holiday will continue into the week. 16.23 France refuses to consider Grexit French prime minister Manuel Valls has told his Parliament that France \"refuses\" to consider a Greek exit from the euro.

Mr Valls warned of geopolitical consequences if Greece sinks into financial catastrophe, such as trouble dealing with high flows of immigrants from outside the European Union or worsening tensions with Russia. He said France is pushing for compromises between Greece and creditors, because that's \"how Europe was built.\" French PM: keeping #Greece in €=utmost geostrategic, geopolitical importance.

Courtesy of the very clever people at Credit Suisse. 14.50 New Greek deal will be tougher than before George Saravelos at Deutsche Bank thinks Athens will have to bow down and accept much harsher bail-out conditions than those they have previously had rejected by creditors. With banks closed, economic activity stalled, and the prospect of IOUs only days away, Mr Saravelos estimates any new three-year bail-out will come with harsher fiscal measures attached. From his morning note: The exact list of \"prior actions\" and \"comprehensive proposals\" has not yet been determined. Statements from Commissioner Juncker, President Tusk and Chancellor Merkel made it clear that the previous EFSF negotiations will be the frame of reference, but that an even greater level of commitment and detail is likely to be required. In effect, Greece has a few days to negotiate the outline of a full third ESM program. The exact detail will be determined in co-ordination with the three institutions (ECB, IMF, EC) over the next few days. But our best guess is that creditor demands are likely to be more strict than under the prior EFSF proposals: on the one hand, Greece's macroeconomic conditions have deteriorated. On the other hand, these commitments will need to refer to a potential third ESM program spanning over a longer time horizon and with greater financing needs 14.34 White House intervenes (again) Washington has been forced to watch on the sidelines as Europe has lurched from fresh crisis to crisis over Greece. Last night, president Obama made his first personal intervention in many a month, phoning both Angela Merkel and PM Tsipras to call for a solution. It didn't seem to do the trick as the summit ended without agreement. Jack Lews, treasury secretary, is speaking at the Brookings Institute today and has again warned of the geopolitical risks associated with Grexit. You can watch his address here.

European parliament president Martin Schulz has not been short of words for the Greek government. Last week, the German called for a technocratic government to replace Mr Tsipras and said the country could not use the euro if they voted 'No' in last weekend's referendum. Following his address at the parliament in Strasbourg this morning, Mr Tsipras has been seen engaging in an intense chat with his colleague. They've got a lot to sort out.

The ECB are due to make a decision on ELA today. Most likely outcome is a \"no change\". But such inaction is a liquidity squeeze in itself as Greece is still in the throes of a very slow moving bank run. Capital controls are sticky thing to get rid of, history tells us. GREECE TO EXTEND BANK HOLIDAY, CAPITAL CONTROLS THROUGH FRIDAY — zerohedge (@zerohedge) July 8, 2015 13.12 Germany: You can't touch the debt Berlin's finance ministry spokesman has said this afternoon there is no chance that Germany will countenance any measures that could be considered as providing debt relief for Greece. This includes a bold attempt to wipe off any of the nominal value of the €330bn debt mountain, or a more modest plan to further extend maturities into the century, as the Greek government has requested. German FinMin spoxman: we reject not only a classic debt haircut but also measures that reduce the current value of debt such as reprofiling — Fabrizio Goria (@FGoria) July 8, 2015 Despite only having four days to keep the single currency in tact, the Germans aren't for turning. Chancellor Merkel last night also ruled out debt reprofiling measures and the prospect of short-term funds being released to Greece to make sure they don't default on the ECB on July 20. She hinted that any such action could be seen as a \"new\" bail-out and thus illegal if not ratified by the Bundestag in advance. As mentioned earlier, Greece's new ESM letter mentions getting the country back on a sustainable debt path. And last night, eurogroup finance ministers also issued a statement which seems to suggest creditors will take another look at the debt problem. German FinMin spoxman: we reject not only a classic debt haircut but also measures that reduce the current value of debt such as reprofiling — Fabrizio Goria (@FGoria) July 8, 2015 12.50 What is Grexit? Matthew Holehouse is at today's Commission briefing in Brussels where everyone is getting tied up in knots about Grexit plans. Do they really exist? Mr Juncker spokesman Mina Andreeva is explain what the Grexit plan he mentioned last night. Or is it just a piece of paper. \"You wouldn't expect me to go beyond what the president said,\" she says. \"I am not now going to outline the scenarios we are working on.\" She declines to say who is working on the plan, or when it was drawn up. What if Greece refuses to do what is required of it? Are you just waiting for the ECB to cut off money supply? \"It is premature to speculate as we are not yet talking about it.\" The spokesman refuses to give a definition for the term Grexit. But the deadline is midnight on Thursday, for assessment on Friday morning. Does Mr Juncker agree with Mr Moscovici that Grexit would be a collective failure, or does it entirely lie in the Greek court at the moment? \"We are a mediator, and we are not engaged in a blame game\", says Ms Andreeva. 12.37 Greece ESM application Here it is in its fully glory. There are no numbers on the size of the package, but it has been estimated to be over €51bn by the IMF for the next three years. The government says \"the Republic is committed to a comprehensive set of reforms and measures to be implemented in the areas of fiscal sustainability, financial stability and long term economic growth.\" The letter says that measures on tax and pensions reforms will be implemented as early as next week. Tomorrow, Athens intends to provide a complete detailed list of their measures for creditors to mull over. On debt restructuring it adds: Greece \" welcomes opportunity to explore potential measures to be take so that its official sector debt becomes both sustainabile over the long ter m.\" And just in case anyone is confused: For avoidance of doubt, this letter supersedes our previous request letter dated 12.29 \"This is our last chance\" Mr Tusk says \"the last chance procedure has started\" in a very powerful closing address to parliamentarians in Strasbourg today. \"Seek help among your friends, not your enemies - especially when they are unable to help you. And if you want to help your friend in need, do not humiliate him.\" \"Without unity we will wake up in four days in a different Europe.\" \"This is really and truly the final wake up call for Greece.\" He says Mr Dijsselbloem has received a new ESM request from the Greeks: \"I hope this is a good sign for tomorrow.\" Wow. @eucopresident is a good speaker - so many times better than @JunckerEU , @MartinSchulz et al. Speaks to point not me, me, me — Bruno Waterfield (@BrunoBrussels) July 8, 2015 12.24 Jean Claude-Juncker defends himself The Commission president is on his feet, and delivers another impassioned address on his tireless role in trying to secure a deal. He repeats the Commission is not looking for reforms which will hurt the poorest pensioners, or those on the minimum wage. Mr Juncker has been called out on this before. The Commission has in fact called for an abolition of supplementary (EKAS) pensions for the poorest to be phased out by 2018. Now EU council president Tusk speaks: \"Morality means paying off your debts.\" The source of the crisis in Greece is over-spending, \"not the common currency\" says Mr Tusk. 12.21 Tsipras: I have no secret plan The Greek PM takes the lectern again after sitting through three hours of debate about his country's woes. He says \"I have no secret plan for Grexit. I want a viable agreement, that's what I'm fighting for.\" \"We don't want new loans to pay off the new ones.\" He now takes on German MEP Manfred Weber who attacked the PM for showing no solidarity. Mr Tsipras makes the point that Germany was a beneficiary of a 60pc debt write-off after the Second World War. \"The strongest moment of European solidarity was in 1953, when your country came out of two world wars, and the people of Europe showed the greatest solidarity at the London Conference. That was the most significant moment of solidarity in European history.\" 12.03 Greeks submit three-year loan request Details of that ESM letter tricking through now. Seems it is a three-year loan request - rather than the previous two years the Greeks applied for last week. No word yet on the conditions attached to the money or indeed how much they are asking for.

Donald Tusk said today creditors have \"four days\" before they reach the point of no return. As Bruno mentions, the Greeks have plenty of hoops to jump through before then. They including setting out a list of \"prior actions\" (legislative plans to pass neccessary reforms), which have to be discussed by finance ministers, gain the consent of the IMF, and then find their way pass the Bundestag. Meanwhile, the ECB will probably have to keep ELA in place until at least the weekend to stop the banks from going bust.

Melanie Hall in Berlin reports: \"I see no new compromise in which no side loses face,\" said Mr Fischer. He adds Greece should be given a debt haircut in exchange for structural reforms, and that creditors begin to discuss the taboo over commonly issued eurobonds. Mr Fischer criticised Mrs Merkel, saying: \"Now we have probably reached the point of no return.\" The ex-minister reproached the German government for having let things go this far, saying: \"It did not argue and act politically, but in accounting terms.\" Mr Fischer has called for a change of course in Europe towards a more growth-orientated policy. Trying to break even like in Germany's federal budget, something which he said everyone is so proud of, would conversely bring the other euro countries nothing. Everyone would recognise this problem \"except Germany\", he said. 11.40 Commission press briefing coming up The European Parliament's session is still going on. Mr Tsipras is manfully sitting through it all. Once it's done, we expect the Commission to give their daily briefing. 11.20 What is the new Greek request? So the European Stability Mechanism has confirmed they have received a letter from Athens. But, unlike reports yesterday, finance ministers will not be having a teleconference to discuss it today. Instead, the technical teams who work on behalf of the finance ministers - the Euro working group - will pour over the plans Request for ESM support received from Greek government, will be dealt with EWG today. No #Eurogroup teleconference #Greece — Michel Reijns (@MichelReijns) July 8, 2015 However, today's letter is probably not the \"comprehensive\" plan creditors are demanding before they can sit down and think about releasing any cash to the country, either on a short term basis to avoid an ECB default, or to approve the ESM loan, which will require a more complicated process of ratification. This is what the last ESM request letter, which was rejected on June 30, looked like Credit Suisse have put out this helpful table of what each eurozone government needs to do before approving an ESM loan package.

He has also said ECB will not continue their emergency cash lifeline for Greek banks indefinitely. Henry Samuel in Paris reports \"The Greek economy is on the brink of catastrophe. A deal absolutely must be reached on Sunday because it will be too late after that and the consequences will be grave,\" France's central bank governor told Europe 1 radio, adding that \"there could be riots... and chaos in the country\". Mr Noyer, a member of the ECB's governing council, added it was \"impossible\" to re-open Greek banks while confidence was so low, saying there would be an \"immediate run\" if they did open for business. Noyer said Greece’s ECB lifeline, which has stretched to €89bn in recent months, could not be carried on indefinitely. \"We have rules and we have interpreted the rules to their limit to maintain a lifeline to Greek banks, but we cannot continue indefinitely to increase the risks we are taking,\" he said. Noyer insisted, however, that Grexit \"would not spell the end of the eurozone\". 10.51 Greeks make new ESM loan request And there it is. The new application for a European Stability Mechanism loan has been made by Athens this morning.

Interesting and colourful, as always. — Alexander Stubb (@alexstubb) July 8, 2015 10.34 Tusk channels Plutarch EU Council president Donald Tusk is a worried man. He addressed the EP this morning. Here are his opening remarks on Greece: All sides of the negotiations share the responsibility for the current status quo. I call on all leaders to try to find consensus ­ that can be our common success with no losers or winners. If this does not happen, it will mean the end of the negotiations with all the possible consequences, including the worst-case scenario, where everyone will lose. Our inability to find agreement may lead to the bankruptcy of Greece and the insolvency of its banking system. And for sure, it will be most painful for the Greek people. I have no doubt that this will affect Europe, also in the geopolitical sense. If someone has any illusion that it will not be so, they are naïve. The stark reality is that we have only four days left to find ultimate agreement. Until now, I have avoided talking about deadlines. But I have to say loud and clear that the final deadline ends this week. All of us are responsible for the crisis and all of us have a responsibility to resolve it. As Plutarch once said: \"To find fault is easy, to do better may be difficult.\" I hope doing better is not so difficult as Plutarch once thought. Let us prove him wrong. 10.25 Carney led emergency meeting on Greece Our economics reporter Szu Chan has been pouring through the Bank of England's financial policy committee meeting report. It provides some details of Mark Carney leading an emergency meeting to discuss Greece on June 29. Mr Carney said the Bank has been attending meetings with the government over a possible Grexit and its impact on the Greek economy. Here's the Guvnor from a press conference today: \" In terms of what we have been doing - yes, we have attended Cobra meetings. Andrew Bailey and I have attended them. That's part of a broader set of discussions with other authorities, including the FCA, importantly, as well as the Treasury, domestically, to share information, but also to be co-ordinated on action.\" \"But the situation is fluid. Defences could be tested; it depends on how things evolve. I wouldn’t want to - you know our eyes are wide open on this, we’re not - our job is not to be complacent - you wouldn’t expect us to be complacent about things. So we’ll be pretty fully engaged until the situation is resolved. 10.15 Marine Le Pen speaks Some odd bed fellows for the Leftist Mr Tsipras. France's Marine Le Pen is next to deliver a rousing defence of his country against euro diktats. Like Mr Farage, she is advocating an exit from the \"steel jaws\" of the euro. She also comes out in favour of Nobel economist Paul Krugman. Today is a strange day. 10.10 Farage time: The plan has failed \"This is not just Greece we are talking about, the whole of the Mediterranean is in the wrong currency\" says the Ukip leader. \"The continent is divided...there is a new Berlin wall and it's called the euro.\" \"Just listen to the way the German leader (Weber) has attacked Mr Tsipras\" he says. But Mr Farage tells the Greek PM he can take no more from Europe (in the form of debt write offs) so instead should \"have the courage to lead the Greek people out of the eurozone...give your people the leadership and hope you crave.\" Nigel Farage tells Tsipras to quit the Euro.

The ECB is due to have its weekly teleconference on the liquidity situation of Greece's banks. ELA has been frozen for banks since last week at €89bn. Comments from Francois Hollande last night suggested the ECB will be keep the ELA cap in place until Sunday at the latest. Governing council member Ewald Nowotny has repeated today that he thinks: \"Greece is a special case. There is no danger of contagion.\" 09.56 \"You are falling into a trap\" Mr Verhofstadt is now accusing Syriza of being complicit in the clientelistic system of Greek politics. He is now lecturing the PM on the reforms he has to carry out, cutting down the public sector and reforming the financial system. Mr Verhofstadt even offers to go to Athens to give the Greeks a hand. \"Lets end the privileges of your ship owners, of the military, of the Orthodox church, of the Greek islands, and the political parties who receive loans and money.\" \"Show that you are a real leader and not a false prophet.

He starts a quite shouty address. \"I'm angry\" he says. \"You are talking about reforms but we never see concrete proposals for reforms. I'm angry because we are sleep walking to a Grexit.\" Listening to @GuyVerhofstadt , @atsipras looks uncomfortable for the first time. #GreeceDebate — Michiel van Hulten (@mvanhulten) July 8, 2015 09.46 Italian Gianni Pittella, head of the European socialist grouping is up next.

But Slovakia is also thinking of holding a referendum, but Slovakia is thinking of holding a referendum because it is fed up of shelling out for the Greeks.\" \"Europe is not the sum of its nationalist views. Europe is compromise.\" Mr Weber is now being shouted down by his fellow parliamentarians. It's all getting a bit rowdy. Weber sits back down to a mix of jeers and applause. Cries of \"shame on you\" ring out for the German. President Schulz is struggling to keep this under control. If you need a better stream, try the BBC parliament live stream. 09.33 Tsipras is \"destroying confidence in Europe\" German MEP Manfred Weber is up next. He accuses Mr Tsipras of \"destroying confidence in Europe.\" \"You are not telling your people the truth.

Mr Tsipras says his country's crisis is just a manifestation of Europe's inability to solve its debt crisis. \"What we now need is a European solution to a European problem.\" And with that, Mr Tsipras's address ends. 09.22 Debt relief is not a means to take money off European taxpayers, says Mr Tsipras. He says the bail-out money never trickled down to the Greek people, but to save European banks. That generates a round of applause from MEP's. 09.17 Tsipras: austerity is more than we can stand Mr Tsipras says the majority of the Greek people \"have no other choice but to \"demand that they be given a way out.\" \"We demand an agreement with our neighbours but one that gives us a sign that we are exiting from the crisis and there is light at the end of the tunnel.

Everyone will lose — Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) July 8, 2015 \"Until now I have avoided talking about deadlines, but I say loud and clear the deadline ends this week.\" \"All of us as responsible for the crisis.\" He ends with a rousing applause. 08.55 Berlin: the Greeks don't want to change Germany's Social Democratic Party lawmaker Carsten Schneider, has told local TV this morning, he thinks there is no willingness on the part of the Greek PM to overhaul his country’s economy. Mr Schneider dimissed any prospect of debt relief for Greece, saying: “Only when I have certainty that this Greek government works in a serious fashion on solving the country’s problems, only then can the debt load be discussed in second step, but not before.\" Athens is expected to submit a formal request for a new rescue programme - up to and maybe more than two years long - today. This is also due to be coupled with a request for some sort term bridging cash to stave off a default in less than 12 days. 08.45 This time is different Having covered most the twists and turns of this now six-month long crisis, last night felt different. European leaders' tone towards the possibility of a Greek exit shifted from one of scare tactics over what no agreement could mean, to openly speaking of the humanitarian aid that will need to be sent to the country after Sunday's deadline. This morning, Pierre Moscovici - the EU's economics chief - has been on Radio 4. Mr Moscovici has consistently been an optimistic observer of events. But even he seems to be flagging: “ An agreement is still possible,\" he told the BBC, but admitted that failure to reach one would be a \"collective failure\" on the part of Europe. \"We are fighting to avoid it.\" \"The door is now open. We’re now waiting for a formal request from the Greek authorities. “We need a comprehensive set of reforms. The Greek authorities need to deliver to show they are committed. “We are certainly in a difficult moment but I am certain if there is a will, there is a way, and I see a will”. 08.30 Tsipras to address parliament The Greek PM is in Strasbourg for a session at the European parliament. You can watch live here. Should begin imminently. 07.30 The morning after the night before Hello and welcome to today's live coverage of Greece's crisis. Last night, creditor powers made it clear: there are five days to stop the European Project from suffering its biggest blow in its 64-year history. Eurozone leaders failed to get closer to striking a deal over bail-out conditions for Greece last night. The usually measured Donald Tusk said without an agreement by Sunday, the EU was ready to face down the \"worst case scenario.\" His words: It will mean the end of the negotiations with all the possible consequences, including the worst-case scenario, where all of us will lose. Our inability to find agreement may lead to the bankruptcy of Greece and the insolvency of its banking system. And for sure, it will be most painful for the Greek people. I have no doubt that this will affect all Europe also in the geopolitical sense. If someone has any illusion that it will not be so, they are naive. The stark reality is that we have only five days left to find the ultimate agreement. Until now, I have avoided talking about deadlines. But tonight I have to say loud and clear that the final deadline ends this week. All of us are responsible for the crisis and all of us have a responsibility to resolve it. I called on all leaders to try to find consensus; all sides of the negotiations share the responsibility for the current status quo. — Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) July 7, 2015 President Jean-Claude Juncker admitted: “We have a Grexit scenario, prepared in detail.” You can watch back all the drama here. Today, we will see the Greeks put foward a formal bid to gain some short-term funding as well as a request for a new rescue programme. Alexis Tsipras will be appearing before the European Parliament in Strasbourg, and finance ministers are set to hold a teleconference on the Greek plans later in the today. Some selected highlights from last night Sunday will be 'important decision', important that everyone is there, all EU , says Merkel — Bruno Waterfield (@BrunoBrussels) July 7, 2015 After tonite's summit, seems #Grexit may be days away. I'm shutting down. Final story of the night just posted here: http://t.co/20bqXPQMwx — Peter Spiegel (@SpiegelPeter) July 7, 2015 So, for Greece. This is like, for real this time? — Joseph Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) July 7, 2015 Both Juncker and Tusk highlighted that there was a plan for humanitarian aid, if Greece did go. — Duncan Robinson (@duncanrobinson) July 7, 2015 Follow the Telegraph on LinkedIn.
