Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) sent a letter asking the Transportation Department to investigate the \"price spikes\" to \"ensure that they were not attempts by airlines to make money off of desperate travelers who were impacted by the tragedy,\" The Journal reports. \nAdditionally, JetBlue will release its 2015 second quarter earnings results on July 28 before the market open. \nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings team rates JETBLUE AIRWAYS CORP as a Buy with a ratings score of A.

This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, solid stock price performance, impressive record of earnings per share growth, compelling growth in net income and good cash flow from operations.
