Picture: Cord Rodefeld Source: Flickr \nMONACO is a charming mix of sophistication, extravagance and sheer glamour. \nKnown for its 700-year monarchy, scenic seaside topography, and tiny geographic footprint — it’s about the size of New York’s Central Park — Monaco’s curiosity factor has always remained high. \nAnd when you learn that the locals don’t pay income taxes, the supercars and megayachts that can be found all around the place suddenly start to make sense. \nHere’s where to eat, drink, stay, shop and visit in Monte Carlo — the principality’s largest district: \n• Casino De Monte-Carlo \nMingle with mega-rollers at the Casino de Monte-Carlo, housed in a majestic 150-year-old Belle Epoque confection. It’s a must for gamblers and non-gamblers alike: After all, it was the inspiration for fictional casino Royale-Les-Eaux in Ian Fleming’s first James Bond novel Casino Royale . \nThe casino is highly regarded for its variety of table games: English roulette, trente & quarante, baccarat, Black Jack and Ultimate Texas Hold’em. It also houses over 1000 slot machines, the largest collection in Europe. The casino is impressive.

While the ceremony of sharp-looking palace protectors only lasts a few minutes, linger around the plaza and peruse the adjacent shops while enjoying stunning mountain top Mediterranean views. Supercars everywhere.

Built in 1913, Villa Paloma is housed in a mansion with prime vistas of the sea and the city. Villa Paloma has no permanent shows, but a current exhibition features the work of Italian painter Alessandro Pessoli. \n• Thermes Marins Monte-Carlo \nThermes Marins Monte-Carlo, part of Société des Bains de Mer, is a divine massive facility that goes well beyond the standard spa menu. It’s connected to the Hotel Hermitage and features an indoor saltwater pool and the L’Hirondelle restaurant. \nLook for a seemingly endless array of treatments, including wraps to lift and firm collagen, and caviar and chocolate exfoliation. A must? The cryotherapy room, where temperatures drops below -100 celcius, a process which claims to treat muscle and inflammatory diseases. The Thermes Marins Monte Carlo.

Keep hydrated with its exhaustive cocktail list, which includes a perennial summer favourite, the Black & Berry, consisting of vodka, blackberries, lime juice, Chambord liqueur and Champagne. Aside from the drinks, the nightly live jazz entertainment, with a singer and pianist, is a huge draw. \n• Hotel Hermitage \nMonte Carlo is not lacking on the luxe lodgings front, but no other property epitomises the principality’s sophisticated past like the glorious 280-room Hotel Hermitage. Built in 1890 by French architect Nicolas Marquet, the lobby was designed by none other than Gustave Eiffel. Spacious rooms overlook the harbour and Mediterranean Sea, and are largely designed in hues of taupe, aubergine and gold. \nThere’s also the Michelin-starred Vistamar, which serves up heavenly French cuisine. Tip: For a sublime dining experience, book a guest room with a terrace, and order room service. The lavish Hotel Hermitage.

It consists of five futuristic-looking, pebble-shaped spaces totalling nearly 25,000 square feet. The pavilions carry a who’s-who of the luxury fashion world, including Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, Chanel, Chopard, Miu Miu and Yves Saint Laurent. \n• Blue Bay & Las Brisas at Monte-Carlo Bay Hotel & Resort \nDining at the Monte Carlo Bay, where Martinique native Chef Marcel Ravin oversees the kitchens, is a tantric tastebud experience. First, there’s his Michelin-starred Blue Bay, which serves cuisine inspired by his Caribbean island homeland and the Mediterranean. Choose between sitting inside opposite the open kitchen or enjoy the seaside air on the terrace. For lighter fare and a more relaxing vibe, head to Las Brisas, located between the sea and the lagoon, where salads and grilled fish of all stripes reign supreme. What a view. Picture: Lori Branham Source: Flickr \n• Monte-Carlo Beach Hotel \nChannel the glamour of the Jazz Age and stay at the 40-room Monte-Carlo Beach Hotel, situated in France on Côte d’Azur, just outside of Monaco. Built in 1929 by French architect Roger Seassal and redesigned in 2009 by India Mahdavi, the vibe is low-key with a decor that’s contemporary. There are four restaurants, but lunch at the outdoor Le Deck is a must. A draw for many guests, though, is the private landing dock and an area to swim in the sea that’s netted off, which filters out any unpleasant sealife. \n• The Opera de Monte-Carlo \nPart of the Casino de Monte Carlo complex is the seaside Salle Garnier, home of the Opera de Monte Carlo. The 130-year-old, 524-seat opera house consistently has a stellar roster of productions. This season, for example, includes Romeo & Juliet , Guillaume Tell , Don Giovanni and Lady Macbeth ” And on a non-opera note, it also hosted the dinner reception for the 2012 royal wedding of Prince Albert II and Charlene Wittstock. \nThis story originally appeared on the NYPost .
