Company principals recently traveled to Australia on a Good Will Mission, where they met with civic and business leaders with the aim of securing investment in Chicago's Southside neighborhoods. Elite Invest is one of the leading community rehabilitation companies in Chicago , and has purchased and rehabilitated thousands of lower-income properties, and transformed them into safe, high quality homes that improve entire neighborhoods. Unlike other investment firms that \"gentrify\" neighborhoods, resulting in the properties no longer being affordable to local residents, the guiding principle of Elite Invest is to improve properties in a manner that assures that they will continue to be affordable for local residents, and will qualify for Section 8 rentals. According to Alex Al-Sabah , company founder and principal, the spirit of humanity touches everything within the company. \"I was raised to believe that if you do good onto others, you will receive good in return,\" Al-Sabah commented. \"We are focused on doing good for all of our stakeholders, including the local residents, our renters, and our investors,\" he added. \"It gives us joy and creates a sense of pride that we are able to improve the quality of life for so many Chicagoans, while also building wealth for our investors. I know of no other company that strikes this delicate, yet vital balance.\"Elite Invest has developed a proprietary system of identifying properties, purchasing buildings, and rehabilitating units with modern, safe, and design-forward touches; while providing investors an opportunity to participate in the process. The company's subsidiary, Elite Rentals and Management, helps makes the entire process seamless and completely turnkey for the passive investor. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T17:02:32.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
