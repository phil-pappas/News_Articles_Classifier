(Photo: Kristie Kellahan)\n7 CONNECT 36 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE HAVANA—At Parque Central, a park anchored by a statue of national hero Jose Marti, a favorite pastime among Cubans is to try to guess one's nationality.\n\"Mexico,\" a man shouts at me.\n\"No,\" I respond.\n\"De dónde eres?\" he asks. (Where are you from?)\n\"Estados Unidos,\" I reply.\nMy answer immediately elicits excited responses.\n\"America!\" cab driver Roberto Garcia exclaims as he switches to English. \"Now Cuba and America is together.\"\nThe USA and Cuba are still a long way from being together, but they are inching towards a reconciliation after more than half a century of feuding.\nPresident Obama's administration is moving to resume diplomatic ties with our foreign neighbor just 90 miles from Key West. In January, the administration eased travel restrictions, allowing U.S. citizens to visit Cuba for 12 approved purposes, including religious activities and professional meetings. The USA and Cuba plan to open embassies in each other's countries.\nThe dramatic reversal in policy has many U.S. citizens positioning themselves to explore the elusive island.\nUSA TODAY\nCruise giant Carnival Corp. to launch sailings to Cuba\nIn 2013, about 570,000 U.S. citizens visited Cuba, many on approved educational programs called people-to-people tours, which were introduced by the Obama administration in 2011. Last year, the number of U.S. visitors grew closer to 700,000, according to the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia.\nU.S. citizens are still not allowed to visit strictly for leisure, but their options for tours and flights are expanding. Last week, Carnival Corp. announced that it would begin people-to-people tours to Cuba through its new social impact-focused fathom brand. JetBlue just began offering a New York to Havana flight through Cuba Travel Services, a charter flight company.\nUSA TODAY\nJetBlue expands service to Cuba\nCuba already has a thriving tourism industry, with Canadians and Europeans as their top visitors. But the recent developments have many wondering if the quaint island will soon be forced to step into the future.\nNot much has changed here since the embargo started in 1959. People drive around in 1950s Buicks, Fords and other vintage cars. In towns outside of Havana, many even commute by horse and buggy. And in a world where Starbucks and McDonald's are omnipresent, it's refreshing not to see a single one for days.\n\"I wanted to come before it changes when it's still shabby chic because I think it is going to change,\" says Gary Cummins, a British tourist I meet in Vinales Valley, a tobacco-growing region about two hours outside of Havana. \"I think it will get busier.\"\nMy one week in Cuba, however, has me convinced that Cummins need not worry too much. It will get busy, but change will take time.\nHotel rooms get booked quickly, restaurants often run out of food, those charming vintage cars break down, iPhones don't work, and Wi-Fi is hard to come by.\n\"It's a fairly complicated destination,\" says Eddie Lubbers, founder and CEO of Cuba Travel Network, which has been helping travelers book trips to Cuba for 13 years.\nI strike out at my first attempts to book rooms directly on the hotels' websites, so I turn to Cuba Travel Network, which has an outpost in Amsterdam and offices in Cuba. The company secures me rooms on separate nights at the Hotel Inglaterra, Hotel Florida and Hotel Raquel, three charming historic properties in Old Havana. I pay for them with my U.S. credit card, which most Cuban vendors would not accept.\nFor my nights in Trinidad, I reach out to AirBnB, which recently started listing more than 1,000 \"casas particulares\" -- or privately-owned homes -- throughout the island. Again, I use my U.S. credit card on AirBnB's website.\nU.S. ATM cards also do not work here. I arrive with $1,000 in cash for a week's stay -- not exactly a scenario that makes me feel secure.\nNot surprisingly, the exchange rate is not in a U.S. traveler's favor. Anyone switching a foreign currency to a convertible peso, or CUC, has to pay a 3% fee. Add another 10% fee if exchanging U.S. dollars.\nIt's easy to forgive those inconveniences when taking in the beautiful Baroque and neoclassical architecture of Old Havana, listening to a band play salsa while sipping rum, and talking to the warm and welcoming locals. Or when climbing up to the bell tower of the Convent of Saint Francis of Assisi in the south central Cuba town of Trinidad for a magnificent view of the beautifully preserved UNESCO World Heritage site and the surrounding Escambray Mountains. Or when driving down the long and dramatic causeway to Cayo Santa Maria in north central Cuba.\nMy first visit to Cuba in 2012 was on a people-to-people tour. We couldn't break free from our group, and we didn't have much genuine interaction with ordinary Cubans.\nFor my second trip here, I opt against the comforts and confinements of a tour. This time, I can't avoid conversations with Cubans even if I want to.\nCubans are fascinated by foreigners, and when I stop for traffic below the China Town arch, Lasaro Solo Peres asks me where I am from.\nPeres, a welder, says he is eager for the two countries to forge a union.\n\"America can invest in Cuba,\" he says in Spanish. \"I think it's good for the betterment of our country.\"\nHe walks with me to the Parque de la Fraternidad, which was built in 1892 for the fourth centennial of Columbus' discovery of America. It was redesigned in 1928 when the Pan-American conference was held in Havana. Busts of American leaders such as Simon Bolivar of Colombia are scattered around the park.\nEven Abraham Lincoln is memorialized in a bust—a reminder of a time when the two nations were in solidarity.\nCuba has fallen on some hard times since, a result of being so economically isolated for so long.\nWhile foreigners use the CUC, pegged to the U.S. dollar, locals use the national currency, worth much less.\nOn my first day in Havana, a woman I recognize from the tour booking desk at the Hotel Inglaterra approaches me while I am taking a stroll nearby.\n\"America!\" I hear once again.\nShe has just finished her shift and offers to take me to a \"tobacco cooperative\" where I can get cigars at a discount. If I buy cigars, she'll get a finder's fee that she can use to buy milk for her son.\nIt's not the last time I get such an offer, or plea.\nBut there are signs of progress.\nGustavo Suarez, who was born in Cuba but left for New York when he was 5, has noticed a change since he was last here a decade ago.\nSome Cubans are now allowed to run small businesses such as paladares, or restaurants. Others can rent out their homes as casas particulares. Many of the crumbling buildings with rusty wrought iron balconies that stand side by side with Old Havana's elegant architectural gems are getting restored.\n\"The private businesses have really made a difference,\" Suarez says. \"The economic dynamism is something I had never seen before.\"\n7 CONNECT 36 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE //usat.ly/1MxrELB TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/573a0c34f265f784c0ee10abbfcf3249aad68e05/c=0-0-2448-2448/local/-/media/2015/07/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635714415885388681-photo-3.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/af2a803d500d9401f8c4f5ebbed0839100dddb50/c=334-0-2170-2448&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/07/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635726485658305123-OldHavana-Photo-Jun-07-6-51-47-PM.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/07/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635726485658305123-OldHavana-Photo-Jun-07-6-51-47-PM.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1MxrELB&mini=true", "http://usat.ly/1MxrELB", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/16f7648b6fa31adb86b9b251d4502a35d4d5310b/c=901-0-4143-3242/local/-/media/2015/07/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635718505909122911-AFP-539493720-72149944.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1MxrELB&text=Cuba%20a%20la%20carte%3A%20Forgoing%20tours%20brings%20travel%20challenges&via=usatoday"], "published": "2015-07-17T08:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T13:16:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
