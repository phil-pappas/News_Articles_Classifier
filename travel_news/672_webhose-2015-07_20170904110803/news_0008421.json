(NYSE: CHH ) today reported the following highlights for the second quarter 2015: Revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2015 totaled $232.2 million , an increase of 17 percent from the same period of 2014. Domestic hotel executed franchise agreements totaled 139 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 , an increase of 11 percent from the same period of 2014. New domestic hotel franchise agreements executed in the second quarter of 2015 for the Comfort family of brands increased 67 percent over the same period of the prior year with nearly 60 percent of agreements representing new construction hotels. Executed 5 new domestic franchise agreements during the three months ended June 30, 2015 for the Cambria hotels & suites brand expanding to new markets including Philadelphia, PA and Memphis, TN. Domestic relicensing and contract renewal transactions totaled 85 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 , an increase of 13 percent from the same period of 2014. The company's new construction domestic pipeline of hotels under construction or approved for development increased 30 percent from June 30, 2014 , and the total pipeline increased 22 percent.  The increase in the new construction hotel pipeline was led by the company's Comfort family of brands which increased 44 percent over the same period of the prior year. Franchising revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2015 , totaled $98.6 million , an increase of 5 percent from the same period of 2014. Domestic royalty fees for the three months ended June 30, 2015 , totaled $75.8 million , an increase of 6 percent from the same period of 2014. Domestic system-wide revenue per available room (\"RevPAR\") increased 6.7 percent in the second quarter of 2015, as occupancy and average daily rates increased 170 basis points and 3.8 percent, respectively from the same period of 2014. Domestic units increased 0.3 percent from June 30, 2014 . Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") from franchising activities for the three months ended June 30, 2015 , totaled $69.8 million , an increase of 5 percent from the same period of 2014.  Diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") from continuing operations for the three months ended June 30, 2015 , totaled $0.62 , an increase of 3 percent from the same period of 2014. On July 21, 2015 , the company completed the refinancing of its existing $350 senior secured credit facility with a new five year, $450 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. \"We are pleased with our second quarter operating results that were highlighted by strong domestic RevPAR performance and franchise sales results,\" said Stephen P. Joyce , president and chief executive officer, Choice Hotels. \"Once again our RevPAR performance continued to outpace the gains reported by Smith Travel Research in the chain scale segments in which we compete and as reflected in our franchise sales results our programs to accelerate the growth of the Cambria hotels and suites and Comfort brands have been well received by developers and franchisees. We continue to be optimistic that these programs will drive the continued improvement and expansion of these brands.\"\nDiscontinued Operations \nDuring 2014, the company entered into and completed a plan to sell its three owned hotels operated under the MainStay Suites brand. The company determined that the sale of these hotels met the definition of a discontinued operation since the operations and cash flows of these components have been eliminated from the on-going operations of the company and the company does not have significant continuing involvement in the operations of the hotels after the transaction. As a result, the company's consolidated statement of income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 , reflects these three company-owned hotels as discontinued operations.\nSummarized financial information related to these discontinued operations is presented in Exhibit 9 of this press release.                   \nOutlook \nThe company's consolidated 2015 outlook reflects the following assumptions:\nAll figures assume no repurchases of common stock under the company's share repurchase program; and The effective tax rate for continuing operations is expected to be approximately 32% for both the third quarter and full-year 2015, respectively. Franchising \nEBITDA from franchising activities for full-year 2015 are expected to range between $254 million and $257 million ; Net domestic unit growth for 2015 is expected to be approximately 1%; RevPAR is expected to increase approximately 6.5% for the third quarter and range between 6.5% and 7.5% for full-year 2015; and The effective royalty rate is expected to increase 2 basis points for full-year 2015 as compared to full-year 2014. SkyTouch \nNet reductions in EBITDA relating to our investment in the SkyTouch division for full-year 2015 are expected to range between $15 million and $20 million . Consolidated Outlook \nThe company's third quarter 2015 diluted EPS is expected to be $0.72 . The company expects full-year 2015 diluted EPS to range between $2.18 and $2.22 and full year 2015 EBITDA to range between $237 million and $241 million . \nConference Call \nChoice will conduct a conference call on Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 9:00 a.m. EDT to discuss the company's second quarter 2015 results.

These forward-looking statements are based on management's current beliefs, assumptions and expectations regarding future events, which in turn are based on information currently available to management.  Such statements may relate to projections of the company's revenue, earnings and other financial and operational measures, company debt levels, ability to repay outstanding indebtedness, payment of dividends, repurchases of common stock and future operations, among other matters.   We caution you not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements do not guarantee future performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors.\nSeveral factors could cause actual results, performance or achievements of the company to differ materially from those expressed in or contemplated by the forward-looking statements.

These and other risk factors are discussed in detail in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including our annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports filed on Form 10-Q.  We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nStatement Concerning Non-GAAP Financial Measurements Presented in this Press Release \nEBITDA, franchising revenues, franchising SG&A, EBITDA from franchising activities and franchising margins are non-GAAP financial measurements.  These measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or liquidity as promulgated under or authorized by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"), such as operating income, total revenues and operating margins.  The company's calculation of these measurements may be different from the calculations used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.  The company has included an exhibit accompanying this release that reconciles EBITDA, franchising revenues, franchising SG&A and franchising margins to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. We discuss management's reasons for reporting these non-GAAP measures below.\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization: EBITDA reflects income from continuing operations excluding the impact of interest expense, interest income, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, other (gains) and losses and equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates. We consider EBITDA to be an indicator of operating performance because we use it to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, and expand our business. We also use EBITDA, as do analysts, lenders, investors and others, to evaluate companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be dependent on a company's capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. Accordingly, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. The tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies. EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. These differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies. \nFranchising Revenues, Operating Income, EBITDA, SG&A and Margins:  The company reports franchising revenues, operating income, EBITDA, SG&A and margins which exclude marketing and reservation revenues, the SkyTouch Technology operations and revenue generated from the ownership of an office building that is leased to a third-party.  Marketing and reservation activities are excluded since the company is required by its franchise agreements to use the fees collected for marketing and reservation activities; as such, no income or loss to the company is generated. Cumulative marketing and reservation system fees not expended are recorded as a liability in the company's financial statements and are carried over to the next year and expended in accordance with the franchise agreements. Cumulative marketing and reservation expenditures in excess of fees collected for marketing and reservation activities are deferred and recorded as an asset in the company's financial statements and recovered in future periods.  SkyTouch Technology is a division of the company that develops and markets cloud-based technology products, including inventory management, pricing and connectivity to third party channels, to hoteliers not under franchise agreements with the company. The operations for SkyTouch Technology are excluded since they do not reflect the company's core franchising business but are an adjacent, complimentary line of business. These non-GAAP measures are a commonly used measure of performance in our industry and facilitate comparisons between the company and its competitors.\n©  2015 Choice Hotels International, Inc.
