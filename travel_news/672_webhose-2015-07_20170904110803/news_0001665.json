The castle, Morales says, is \"often referred to as the alleged Dracula's castle.\" \nTravel tips: Built in 1212, Bran Castle sits on 22 acres and is visited by 560,000 tourists a year. \"The castle tour takes you through some interesting rooms, but be forewarned, there is one corridor that might give some pangs of concern to a person who is claustrophobic. One is, as always, advised to wear comfortable, closed walking shoes.\" Courtesy of Bill Mathiasen SPAIN: San Jose resident Bill Mathiasen spent time recently in Spain s Basque Country and France s St. Jean de Luz and Biarritz region.

(Bill Mathiasen) SPAIN: San Jose resident Bill Mathiasen spent time recently in Spain's Basque Country and France's Saint-Jean-de-Luz and Biarritz region. He particularly enjoyed the Basque city of San Sebastián -- \"incredible shopping, views, beaches, walking paths, food, drink, wine and pintxos (the local tapas) on the Gulf of Vizcaya,\" he says. Inland daytrips included Pamplona, Vitoria-Gasteiz and the villages of the Pyrenees. Advertisement \nTravel tips: There are five airports in this region with flights to the United Kingdom and Europe. \"Check out the prices and availability for these airports to get excellent bargains,\" Mathiasen suggests. \"Visit in late April and May or September/October for best prices.\" Bear in mind that the Basque region has its own language, so when you dine out on the excellent local cuisine, you may want to ask for a Spanish or English menu. The Guggenheim Museum, near the Bilbao airport, is a great pick for avant-garde exhibitions, \"however, each city has a unique museum. In Biarritz, there is a chocolate museum -- a must visit.\" Share your travels with us! Send your recent vacation selfies to jburrell@bayareanewsgroup.com .
