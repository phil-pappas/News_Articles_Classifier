Subscribe now to Kahler Slater A Homewood Suites from the HIlton Hotels group will be part of the Mayfair Collection's… more New retail developments and the job-creation potential of the Milwaukee Regional Medical Center and University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Innovation Campus make Wauwatosa a hot market for hotel development, according to industry leaders. Two hotels — the Residence Inn by Marriott near West Watertown Plank Road at the Innovation Campus and the Homewood Suites Hotel in the Mayfair Collection retail development — are under construction and will add 268 rooms to the area by the end of the year. The market will demand more, said Greg Hanis , president of Hospitality Marketers International Inc. The New Berlin-based consultant to hotel businesses said the Milwaukee suburb was considered a hotel hub decades ago but many of the older properties became outdated or were removed. The new retail offerings will be one of the drivers for additional hotels, Hanis said. “It’s not a main, all-in-one demand generator, but having retail and restaurants near a hotel gives the hotel support services and activities for the guests,” Hanis told the Milwaukee Business Journal. “The vitality of that area is definitely conducive to new hotel development, and you have one of the area’s largest tourist destinations just south of there: the Milwaukee County Zoo .” Paul Upchurch , president and chief executive officer of Visit Milwaukee, said occupancy rates have increased steadily in Wauwatosa as more restaurants and retail options attracted more visitors. “They are the perfect storm for hotel development,” Upchurch said. More lodging developments west of Milwaukee would serve as a complement to the new rooms being added downtown, including a hotel identified in the proposed plans for a new Milwaukee Bucks arena and entertainment district in the Park East neighborhood north of the BMO Harris Bradley Center . That would add to the Westin Hotel and the Spring Hill Suites now in the planning stages in the downtown area. Those two developments would add another 350 rooms, but leave unfilled the need for a major hotel project to complement expansion of the Wisconsin Center , the city’s convention space. “If you build a hotel, you could go after different conventions,” Hanis said. Hanis and Upchurch both said a hotel developer would need a tax incremental financing district or other incentives from the city to make such a project work. And it would require agreement on a plan and source of funding to expand the Wisconsin Center. \nWant Milwaukee Travel news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
