We are also hiring 137 more train operators specifically to work on the night Tube,\" said Griffiths.\nHe added: \"For those who are affected, it will mean a few extra nights per year within the existing working week.\n\"No-one is being asked to work more hours than they do now. We are not asking staff to work unlimited nights and weekends.\"\nRMT general secretary Cash said: Despite strenuous efforts by union negotiators to press London Underground to address the issues of fairness, safety, work-life balance and equality at the heart of this dispute, they have come up with nothing in the talks.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-07-08T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T12:14:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
