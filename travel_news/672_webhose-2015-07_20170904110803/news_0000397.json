Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said the country will make immediate reform changes.

Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakaloto said he was buoyed by the Euro leaders’ “political will to give Greece a chance”. Picture: AP/Michel Euler Source: AP\nMany Eurozone leaders could not hide their fury at being summoned to the emergency meeting and to hear the Greek delegation’s plan only to see their finance minister with nothing to table.\nThe pair has now been given to Thursday to get serious and come up with a reform plan. They are today expected to ask for a bridging loan until the end of the month ahead of an anticipated agreed plan.\nOn Sunday, the 28 leaders of the full European Union will meet to assess the final proposals for Greece that European Union President Donald Tusk described as “maybe the most critical moment in our history”.\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte accused the Greeks of again playing games as their country goes to the brink.\n“I’m very cheerless about this summit and I’m very cheerless about the fact whether Greece wants to come with proposals at all,” he said.\nNo new reform plans ... Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras leaves the building after an emergency summit of eurozone heads of state or government in Brussels on Tuesday. Picture: AP/Michel Euler Source: AP\n“The only solution is for Greece to make far reaching reforms and implement difficult measures. The fate of Greece in the euro and the responsibility is in Athens, not here. The Greek government is taking a large risk with the interests of the Greek people.”\nThe leaders from Lithuania, Belgium and Ireland also expressed disappointment and disgust by Greece’s attitude.\n“With the Greek government it is every time manana,” Lithuania’s President Dalia Grybauskaite said using the Spanish word for tomorrow.\nBelgian’s Prime Minister Charles Michel said: “We can’t do it with a gun to our head or a knife at our throats. A prime minister has to face up to his responsibilities.”\nTsakalotos said “progress” had been made at the summit despite the lack of a detailed document and he was buoyed by the Euro leaders’ “political will to give Greece a chance”.\nHe left the leader’s summit venue in the evening declaring: “My impression is that we are having a go to find an agreement soon.” Peacekeeper ... President Barack Obama wants to see a solution to the Greek financial crisis. Picture: AP/Evan Vucci Source: AP\nLike other leaders, German Chancellor Angela Merkel also remained unconvinced.\n“We still do not have the basis for negotiations,” she said at the summit.\n“It is not a question of weeks any more, but a question of a few days,” warned the leader of Europe’s biggest economy, who faces huge domestic pressure to be tough on Greece.”\nObama becomes middle man in Greek crisis\nObama rang and spoke with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras yesterday to enforce his desire for a resolution. He had earlier spoken with Merkel by phone urging her and her colleagues to find a solution.\n“We continue to encourage all sides to participate constructively in those conversations,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, renewing calls for a deal between Athens and its creditors.\nHe added: “The leaders agreed it is in everyone’s interest to reach a durable agreement that will allow Greece to resume reforms, return to growth, and achieve debt sustainability within the eurozone. The leaders noted that their economics teams are monitoring the situation in Greece and remain in close contact.”\nMeanwhile in Greece, the banks and the local stock exchange remained closed, a cap on withdrawals were still in place and liquidity remained critical.\nOriginally published as Greece forced into spectacular backflip", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/08/1227433/924304-013f513a-2519-11e5-b9c8-881f1ce24d70.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/08/1227433/925071-fc9fa576-2518-11e5-b9c8-881f1ce24d70.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/us-president-barack-obama-forced-to-intervene-in-the-greece-crisis/story-fnu2pycd-1227433925231", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/08/1227434/352792-f01a866c-2537-11e5-a1dc-713890f6a5ce.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/08/1227434/352766-a70347d6-2571-11e5-a1dc-713890f6a5ce.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/08/1227433/925203-7c30f4f2-2519-11e5-b9c8-881f1ce24d70.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-09T07:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T20:17:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
