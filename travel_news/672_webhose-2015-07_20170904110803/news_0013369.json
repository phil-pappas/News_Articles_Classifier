I really can’t think of a better spot to practice yoga than quiet location, surrounded by nature, far away from the crowds of tourists you can see in pretty much every holiday location. I’ve decided to prepare a list with the top suggestions to consider for your creative yoga holiday in Europe, as a source I used one of the leading creative holiday websites Neal’s Yard Holidays : Costa Blanca, Spain \nSpain is known for having the most breath-taking sceneries of the Mediterranean Sea and Costa Blanca is no exception.

With some of the best professionals in the country, the staff will do all it takes to make you feel good and regenerate your strength. Dalyan, Turkey \nAlthough, Turkey is probably most famous for its Mediterranean beaches, the insides of the country carry huge doze of nature charm.

La Roane, France \nIf I somehow have the chance to get the summer of my dreams, I will most likely visit rural France, as I am really looking forward to experience the charm of this country without bumping into crowds of tourists. La Roane is located in the Southwest part of the country and there you have the rare opportunity to enjoy multiple activities, experience vegetarian French cuisine, prepared by award winning chef and also just relax at the spa. Furthermore, its just 3 miles away from the St. Antonin medieval market, a spot definitely worth visiting! ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T19:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T01:44:22.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
