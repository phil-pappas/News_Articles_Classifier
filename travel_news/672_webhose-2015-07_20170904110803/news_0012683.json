Ugne Bubnaityte, 32, loves to cook, but is also a bodybuilder, and prides herself on her creative, healthy bakes. \"I am a big fitness fanatic, and would like to show you that there are ways and means to indulge nice treats and not to be worried about the waistline,\" she writes on her blog. \"My aim is to introduce healthier versions of bakes next to the beautiful ordinary sinful goodness I love to treat my family.” Making healthier bakes isn't as as hard as you might think. Healthy eating blogger Deliciously Ella, who confesses to having a serious sweet tooth, recommends replacing refined sugar with naturally sweet alternatives, such as maple syrup, fruit puree (especially banana and apple) and dates . \"Most of those are liquids, so it can be tricky to swap them directly for the same measurement of white sugar,\" she advises. \"That said, it is totally possible though it may take some trial and error to reproduce your favourite cake. After a few weeks you get the hang of what works and what doesn’t.\" Here, we share a few tried and tested recipes for healthier bakes.
