There's an 18-hole golf course within 20 kilometres and an adventure park with flying foxes and treetop walks not too far away, should all that perfect peace get too much. \nDomaine des Etangs is a member of the Small Luxury Hotels of the World group of luxury boutique properties. From around $970 (low season) and up to around $2985 (high season) a night.
