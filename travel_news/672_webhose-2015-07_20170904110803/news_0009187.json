Trips leave from Las Vegas and South Rim and include landing and air-only flights. But book soon as trips sell out fast during this hottest time of the year. \nLas Vegas \nThe air-only tour from Vegas is currently marked down. It’s the one that goes over Lake Mead and Hoover Dam before flying over the National Park. Note, too, that it’s usually the “early bird” flight that’s the cheapest. \nThat said, I don’t entirely recommend it because the sun is usually in your face as you fly east to the Canyon. Indeed, the best times to fly are in the morning except this one. If you’re looking to save, however, this is the one for you. \nThe other tour that’s selling quick goes to the bottom for a Champagne picnic. It covers the same ground as the air-only except it goes to the base and lands. There, you’ll get to spend around 30 minutes on the bottom toasting your adventure alongside the Colorado River. \nBe aware that tours that land at the bottom are only available from Las Vegas, NV, and not the South Rim, where only aerial tours are offered. If you want to get to South Rim from Vegas, I recommend the airplane flight to Grand Canyon National Park Airport. \nI also want to take a moment to point out that there are two kinds of helicopter tours: Basic and deluxe. The main difference is the helicopter. Basic tours use the conventional (and smaller) Bell Ranger or AStar, while deluxe tours use the superior EcoStar 130. \nThe EcoStar is vastly superior because if offers up to 25 percent more cabin space (this translates into more legroom and personal space). It also comes with a 180-degree wraparound windshield and stadium-style bucket seats. Further, and this is important, the A/C is nice and cold. \nFinal word about deluxe tours: They depart from the Las Vegas Strip. This is important if you want convenience. It’s also important because deluxe tours come with an extended tour over the Strip on the way back from Canyon. Deluxe flights also include free hotel pick up and drop off by limousine. \nSouth Rim \nThe South Rim helicopter that’s on sale is the basic 30-minute flight. It uses one of the basic helicopters and goes from the South Rim to the North Rim and back. There’s a deluxe version of this tour, too. There’s also a 50-minute flight, which I strongly recommend because it will let you see up to 75% of the Canyon. \nThe other South Rim tour that I’m excited about is the one that combines a 30-minute helicopter tour with a 2-hour Jeep ride. The Jeep is an excellent and efficient way to see all the key sites and landmarks, especially as the Park will be crowded during summer. \nConclusion \nI hope this article about summer deals on Grand Canyon helicopter tours inspired you to take action and book yours today. Summer is the busiest time of the year at the National Park, so if you’re going to go for a heli adventure, do it ASAP in order to get the best prices and the best flight times.
