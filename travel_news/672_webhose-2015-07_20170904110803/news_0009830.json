Under these programmes Transaero's fleet is being expanded with new fuel efficient aircraft with optimal passenger capacity for the current market conditions. \nBy the end of the year, Transaero plans to receive three more A321 aircraft. \nThe A321 is the first Airbus medium-range aircraft in the airline's fleet. It is configured with two classes and can accommodate 184 passengers. The Business class cabin has eight highly comfortable seats with a seat pitch of 55 inches. The Economy class cabin has 176 ergonomic B/E Aerospace slimline seats. The seat pitch is 31 inches. The aircraft is fitted with sharklets. Its passenger cabin is equipped with LED lighting. The seats are fitted with power and USB sockets. \nThe A321 was delivered in a new corporate identity, which the airline uses for all new aircraft joining its fleet. \nTransaero will start operating its first A321s on the high-demand, medium-range routes, i.e. to Paris, Tel Aviv, Astana, Almaty and Novosibirsk. \nDmitry Stolyarov, First Deputy CEO Transaero Airlines, said: \"We are very pleased with this important step made towards further development of our cooperation with Airbus. I would like to express our sincere gratitude to the largest Chinese bank - ICBC Bank and its subsidiary ICBC Leasing, who trust Transaero as a reliable partner, which is highlighted by the implementation of the signed contract. The addition of highly efficient aircraft to the company's fleet will contribute to enhancing the company's profitability, optimizing the airline's passenger capacity, and will see withdrawal of aircraft which are of low demand in the current market conditions.\" \n\"The delivery of the first A321 to Transaero is an important event for us. We are happy to welcome one of the leading Russian airlines as a new Airbus operator. Transaero will undoubtedly benefit from the A321's unbeatable operating costs, while the passengers will enjoy high levels of cabin comfort. We hope today's event will pave the way for further partnership,\" added Andreas Kramer, Vice-President Sales Eastern Europe and Central Asia.‬‬‬", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T22:27:09.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
