Zoo visitor lucky to escape with life... Magaluf holidaymaker passes out over and over again while... Terrifying moment a lion attempts to attack a car driver... Hawk enforces no-fly zone: Territorial bird of prey... But for the most part the man does quite well.\nDespite stumbling down the road, he manages to hold himself up and uses the bike as a form of stabiliser to steady his speed.\nThe crowd make noise as the man begins losing control of his bike and momentum causes him to stumble\nMomentum eventually begins to take over however, and the bike starts to ride away from him as he struggles to control the pace.\nThe crowd notices as the man begins to lose his balance and the noises become louder.\nThe bike then turns sideways and all is lost for the man – he falls onto the floor to the sound of cheering from the group of onlookers.\nThe bike turns sideways and the man loses his footing, which causes him to fall over his bike and onto the floor\nRolling about, the man attempts to get his balance and scrambles to his feet while holding onto the wall for support.\nHe then goes down to pick his bike up from the ground but ends up falling head over heels again and landing on top of it.\nThe video concludes with the man getting to his feet and falling over one more time before a bystander picks up his bike and gives him a much needed hand.\nThe video concludes with the man getting to his feet and using the wall for support as a bystander helps him", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1GQA9xx"], "published": "2015-07-02T22:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T04:53:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
