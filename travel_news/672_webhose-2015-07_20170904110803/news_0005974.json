Rankings in both magazines came from criteria such as a welcoming atmosphere, top-course conditions and great amenities, and it is obvious that these women held the Boulders in high regard. The Boulders is a 36-hole retreat in the Sonoran Desert approximately 20 miles north of Phoenix. The 1,300 acres of the Desert the Boulders offers panoramic views of 12-million-year-old boulder formations and is one of most idyllic backdrops you will find anywhere. The Boulders has been awarded many accolades for its environmentally-sound landscaping, ensuring that the surrounding terrain and plant life have been left untouched. This allows the indigenous flora and fauna to thrive in their natural habitat. The South Course has gold and red tees rated for women, and its holes thread through a stunning rock-strewn landscape punctuated by cactus. To ease newcomers who often feel intimidated by the professional staff at the Boulders, they have been offering female-friendly instructional programs since the mid-1990’s. The Ladies’ Golf and Spa Getaway sets the Boulders apart from many other golf destinations. The getaway starts with a morning fitness session with a certified fitness trainer and a Class A PGA Professional. Next is a healthy morning snack and then off to the course for two hours of golf instruction. You will also be given guidance on how to move effectively on the golf course, what to wear, what to do when you arrive, what to say and how to say it, thus ensuring you'll never be intimidated or anxious when going to the course again. After golf, it’s on to the spa for a healthy lunch, drinks poolside, and a pampering spa service of your choice. Lodging is also provided at the Boulders to heighten your experience. Casitas and Villas are just two of the lodging options that are offered. The Sonoran Casitas have spectacular views of the golf course, boulder pile, and Arizona desert landscape. The Boulders Casitas are stand-alone units which give a more private feel and setting. The Villas range from 1,400 to 2,200 square feet and are available in one-, two-, and three-bedroom combinations. They all feature separate living and dining rooms, kitchens and a full-sized washer and dryer. The Boulders has something to offer everyone and is known for making female golfers of all abilities feel special and welcomed. Ladies get your friends organized and plan a golf getaway to experience all there is to offer at the beautiful Boulders Resort and Spa!
