So here are some tips on how to avoid – or at least reduce – jet lag. Download There are simple but potentially very effective apps designed to minimise the effects of jet lag. Jet Lag Rooster, for instance, asks you for the basic details of your trip, and your sleep habits, and then devises a detailed sleep schedule for the next five days, with times to avoid (and make the most of) the daylight hours. It will actually issue specific orders, such as: “Avoid light for these hours before going to bed at this time and setting your alarm for this time.” Start using it before your trip and you could make yourself almost jet lag-proof before you even get on the plane. The other good news is that this app is completely free. Synchronise Changing your sleep routine a few days beforehand can give you a head start. If you’re flying west, you’ll want to stay up a bit later. If you’re flying east, then stack up on a few early nights. You can still take these synchronising measures when you’re actually on board the plane. Set your watch to the destination’s time zone immediately and then, if possible, time your eating, drinking and napping to coincide with the natural times that you would do these things on arrival. You may have meetings and obligations when you arrive, but try to schedule as much time outside as possible. Morning light will help you in the west, afternoon light in the east. Invest It may seem unfair, but the more you invest in your business trip, the more you’re going to get out of it. As a business, you should weigh up the importance of the meeting – though because you’re travelling for it, it’s likely to be vital. If finances allow, stay an extra night in a hotel Consider flying out on a Saturday or Sunday for a Monday morning meeting – even though this involves an extra night or two in a hotel. See how much more expensive business or first class flights would be, and see if that works for you. The restorative sleep that’s possible on a flat bed (and which will probably elude you in economy) could really work in your favour. These are obviously financial investments but they’re at least worth considering. Digest Your diet and exercise routine can powerfully affect your sleeping patterns. Experts suggest eating a carbohydrate-rich meal the night before your flight, especially if you’re flying west. On arrival, a protein-rich meal will help to restore those natural rhythms more quickly. Try to avoid the airplane meals if at all possible – they are typically served at times that would seem sensible at your home base, but not your destination. It’s also recommended that you eat more lightly than you might otherwise do, so avoid the heavy beef options if you do tuck into that inflight meal. Finally, leave some room in your case for your workout gear – getting in just 30 minutes’ exercise each day of your trip will also be a huge boon to your sleep patterns. Drink No, this is not about knocking back several whiskies to counteract your jet lag. Hydration plays a huge part in keeping your body’s rhythms regular, so make sure you drink lots of water. • For more advice on preparing your business for the tech challenges of the future, visit HP BusinessNow Discover more advice for SMEs: • How to have successful meetings on the road • Five tips for record keeping on the road • Five must-have apps for frequent flyers • Social media infographic: how to boost engagement • Five tips to smarter business travel • Top 10 tips to achieve a better work-life balance", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T19:35:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
