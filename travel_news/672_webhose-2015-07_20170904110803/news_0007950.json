Picture: AAP Source: AAP\nAddressing the conference earlier today Mr Shorten said he believes in a new direction for the party’s immigration policy, including boat turn backs where they are safe to do so.\nHe said he wanted to accept more refugees and ensure they are treated more humanely.\n“I also want to guarantee that we keep closed the lethal journey between Java and Christmas Island which has already claimed sadly so many lives,” he said.\nMr Shorten said the asylum seeker issue was a question of “profound significance” for Labor and Australia and he wanted conference delegates to offer “every view” in Saturday afternoon’s debate.\n“But we must never allow people smugglers to take advantage of a perceived weakness and so ... a Labor government, I believe, must have the option of turning back boats, turning them around, provided it is safe to do so.”\nHe said by 2025 a Labor government would double Australia’s annual humanitarian refugee intake to 27,000 people.\nMr Shorten also announced independent oversight of detention centres, the return of UN protections to the Migration Act, mandatory reporting of child abuse in facilities and a $450 million contribution over three years to the UN high commissioner for refugees.\nMr Shorten said the plan would ensure refugees were treated with greater dignity and humanity.\n“I did not enter politics to shirk hard issues and hard decisions. I stand here determined for our country to be responsible in the world and secure at home, determined for us to be a welcoming, kind, compassionate and safe destination, and determined that Labor will achieve this for Australia,” he said.\nOriginally published as Shorten faces boat showdown", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/turn-back-boat-policy-likely-as-bill-shorten-cobbles-together-shaky-deal/story-fni0fit3-1227454705775", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/24/1227456/092944-9b5e9374-31f4-11e5-9ab0-19db9af17447.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-25T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T07:11:32.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
