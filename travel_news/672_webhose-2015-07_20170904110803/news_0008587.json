Several youth activists have been arrested for violating curfews and throwing stones during protests over the death of a man killed in police custody earlier this month. Most of the demonstrations and arrests have been in the Schilderswijk neighborhood, but tourists should follow curfew orders and avoid large crowds while visiting the city.\nc Comments Got something to say?

Add a comment 0 Iceland: Overuse of the Hrunalaug hot spring has led to damage and may result in the closure of the small but obviously popular tourist spot. Much of the blame goes to tour groups that descend on it in large numbers and campers who ignore \"No Camping\" signs and pitch their tents wherever they please. The owners have contemplated bulldozing it or spreading a heavy layer of manure around it to deter visitors, but either measure would be extreme. Vandalism also has contributed to damage at the site. Tourists should consider visiting nearby Gamla Laugin hot springs instead, which has been developed to handle large groups.\nIndia: Delhi hospitals are preparing for an onslaught of dengue fever cases as the monsoon season approaches, sure to bring waves of disease-carrying mosquitoes. Although health officials are trying to avoid a panic, they want the public to be aware of the increased risks of infection and to protect themselves against mosquito bites. Dengue symptoms include fever, headache, muscle and joint pain.\nNepal: A travel warning remains in place two months after a catastrophic 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit the country May 1. Officials say that most of the damage in Kathmandu has been cleared, but damage in rural areas was more severe and recovery efforts are still underway. Aftershocks are still possible and could cause further damage and safety issues as many buildings, bridges and roadways remain fragile.\nPacific Islands: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported an increase in several mosquito-borne viruses across the Pacific. Dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses have been reported in high numbers in the Cook Islands, Solomon Islands and Marshall Islands, while high numbers of Ross River virus cases were reported in Queensland, Australia. Many infections are caused by the Aedes mosquito, which lives in tropical countries throughout Asia and the Pacific. Symptoms vary only slightly among these viruses and can include fever, headache, joint and muscle pain and fatigue. There are no vaccines against these mosquito-borne infections, and tourists should protect themselves against mosquito bites.\nCompiled from news services and travel sources.
