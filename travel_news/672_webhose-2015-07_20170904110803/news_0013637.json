She pleaded no contest in May to cruelly neglecting an animal, resulting in its death. A no contest plea isn't an admission of guilt but is treated as such for sentencing.\nDuring Thursday's hearing, the 57-year-old Anderson apologized for her actions and pleaded for mercy and probation.\nAnderson was barred from boarding a Jan. 23 flight at the Central Nebraska Regional Airport because the puppy was so young and wasn't properly contained.\nAuthorities say she then was seen entering the restroom. Another woman soon reported finding the Doberman puppy dead in a toilet.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T12:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T19:06:33.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
