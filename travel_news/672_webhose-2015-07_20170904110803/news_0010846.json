His 120-hour voyage from Nagoya broke the record for the world's longest nonstop solo flight, his team said. The late U.S. adventurer Steve Fossett set the previous record of 76 hours when he flew a specially-designed jet around the globe in 2006.\n\nIn this image released by Solar Impulse 2, the solar powered plane, piloted by Andre Borschberg approaches Honolulu Airport in Hawaii early Friday, July 3, 2015, after a record-breaking five-day journey across the Pacific Ocean from Japan. (Jean Revillard/Solar Impulse 2 via AP) \nBut Borschberg flew the Solar Impulse 2 without fuel. Instead, its wings were equipped with 17,000 solar cells that charged batteries. The plane ran on stored energy at night.\nThe engineless aircraft landed in silence, the only sound the hum of a nearby helicopter. About 200 people, including the media, witnessed the touch-down shortly before 6 a.m.\nLater in the morning, Borschberg called the flight an extraordinary experience, saying it marked historical firsts for aviation and for renewable energy.\n\"Nobody now can say that renewable energies cannot do the impossible,\" he said. Asked what was the most challenging part of the journey, he said it was when he and fellow Swiss co-pilot Bertrand Piccard had to decide when exactly to leave Japan, which he called a tough decision.\nBorschberg stayed put for about an hour before finally standing and emerging from the plane. Before exiting, he was approached by customs personnel who asked to see his passport. Some in the waiting crowd waved Swiss flags, and dignitaries shook his hand. Piccard also greeted him and six girls sang a welcoming song in Hawaiian.\nGround crews pushed the plane toward a hangar, where a celebratory attitude waited along with leis and hula dancers.\nThe plane's ideal flight speed is about 28 mph though that can double during the day when sun's rays are strongest. The carbon-fiber aircraft weighs over 5,000 pounds or about as much as a minivan or mid-sized truck.\nBorschberg and Piccard have been taking turns flying the plane on an around-the-world trip since taking off from Abu Dhabi in March. After Hawaii, it will head to Phoenix and then New York.\nThe project, which began in 2002 and is estimated to cost more than $100 million, is meant to highlight the importance of renewable energy and the spirit of innovation. Solar-powered air travel is not yet commercially practical, however, given the slow travel time, weather and weight constraints of the aircraft.\nThe plane is visiting Hawaii just as the state has embarked on its own ambitious clean energy project. Gov. David Ige last month signed legislation directing Hawaii's utilities to generate 100 per cent of their electricity from renewable energy resources by 2045. The utilities currently get 21 per cent of their power from renewable sources.\nBorschberg took naps and practiced yoga to cope with the long hours.\n\"Yoga is a huge support for this flight above the Pacific: it positively affects my mood and mindset,\" he wrote in a tweet from the plane on Thursday.\n---\nMarco Garcia contributed to this report.\n---\nCorrects long headline to reflect that only one pilot was onboard at time of landing.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T16:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T21:51:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
