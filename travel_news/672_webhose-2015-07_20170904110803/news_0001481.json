But for those who are traveling by air, it can also be the worst time of the year. With large numbers of people packing onto overfull flights, you need to have a game plan to survive the holiday travel season. Below are 10 tips that will help you and yours make it from point A to point B with the least amount of inconvenience.\nAbel Mitja Varela/E+/Getty Images 1. Choose your seats early You should always choose your seats when you book your ticket. You have a much better chance of keeping that window or aisle seat if you have a ticket with a seat number in hand.\nPhoto by Benet J. Wilson 2. Get to the airport early Airlines are going to bump passengers during the holidays because they never get enough volunteers. Cut your chances of bumping by being at your gate early. Late arrivals are much more likely to be bumped.\nA pile of luggage. Photo by Benet J. Wilson 3. Avoid checking bags I did an eight-day trip to Seoul, South Korea with a carry-on rollerboard, so do you really need to lug around and pay to check a large suitcase? And if the worst happens and your flight is delayed or cancelled, you are more likely to get on another flight without having checked bags. Use these great packing tips from the About.com Business Travel expert to make this work.\n4. Pack carefully If must check a bag, you don’t want to go over the 50-pound weight limit. Otherwise, you’ll be wasting precious minutes removing items to hit the limit. Also check out the Transportation Security Administration’s website to see what you can -- and can’t -- take past the airport checkpoint.\niPhone apps. Photo by Benet J. Wilson 5. Use your smartphone Your smartphone is your most important weapon in surviving air travel. Two apps I highly recommend are: GateGuru , which has terminal maps and crowd-sourced reviews of food/beverage and retail outlets; Next Flight , which allows searches by city-pair and travel date, and the app shows all the flights available that day, by airline, both nonstop and connecting.\n6. Know your air travel rights Barring weather or an act of God, you actually do have some rights as a traveler. Keep the Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration air travel websites bookmarked on your smartphone in case you get into any trouble.\n7. Bring your own food Even if you have the GateGuru to help you find food, you may not have time to get to them, so carry your own. Bring nonperishable snacks like protein bars, crackers, mixed nuts and granola. Also bring an empty water bottle that can be filled past security.\n8. Book direct flights if possible If you have a direct flight, the odds of something going wrong decrease drastically.\n9. Consider alternative cities One Thanksgiving, I decided to go home to San Antonio at the last minute. Of course, the flights to the Alamo city were packed, but I did find a flight to Corpus Christi, a two-hour drive away, that got me home in plenty of time.\n10. Stagger your travel dates For Thanksgiving, the busiest days are Tuesday, Wednesday, Sunday and Monday. For Christmas, it’s usually the weekends before and after the holiday, along with Christmas Eve. If you have some flexibility, choose other dates to fly in and out.\nShare ", "external_links": ["http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/F/K/luggage-64354_640.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/L/G/K/flying-350251_640.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/L/F/K/luggage-64354_640.jpg", "http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/how-get-through-line-faster", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/L/R/G/photo.PNG", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/o/G/6243860321_268a0601a1_b.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/H/K/granola-303384_640.png", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/L/_/G/2674141286_218ed4c281_o.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/G/K/flying-350251_640.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/L/I/K/boeing-159589_640.png", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/R/G/photo.PNG", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/Q/K/182736769.jpg", "http://www.faa.gov/passengers/", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/L/o/G/6243860321_268a0601a1_b.jpg", "http://airconsumer.ost.dot.gov/publications/flyrights.htm", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/_/G/2674141286_218ed4c281_o.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/I/K/boeing-159589_640.png", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/L/Q/K/182736769.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/L/H/K/granola-303384_640.png"], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T19:39:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
