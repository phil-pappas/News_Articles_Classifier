Kyoto (Japan)\nFor more than 1,000 years, Kyoto was the imperial capital of Japan, and vestiges of this royal history remain in sites such as the Kyoto Gosho palace.\nWhile the two-year-old Ritz-Carlton, Kyoto appeals to luxury travelers with its private Zen gardens overlooking the Kamogawa River, it's also worth considering a stay in a traditional ryokan, or guesthouse.\nYou can't see Kyoto without exploring the city's incredible Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines -- there are more than 2,000 scattered across the city -- but insiders recommend Sanjusangendo, which houses 1,001 statues of the god Kannon, carved from cypress in the 12th and 13th centuries, as well as the iconic Kinkaku-Ji (Golden Pavilion).\nOf course, this traditional city has a touch of the modern, too, such as the sleek new Yoshio Taniguchi-designed wing of the Kyoto National Museum and the Nishijin neighborhood, with its kawaii artisan shops.\nThe Ritz-Carlton Kyoto , Kamogawa Nijo-Ohashi Hotori, Nakagyo-ku, Kyoto 604-0902 Kyoto Prefecture;\n2. Charleston (South Carolina)\nSouth Carolina's oldest city has consistently charmed T+L readers with its antebellum aesthetic and old-fashioned Southern hospitality.\nIt's the only U.S. city represented in the overall list, and repeatedly appears on its America's Favorite Cities lists.\nDespite its famed friendliness, Charleston has been in the news for all the wrong reasons, becoming the most recent site of a great national tragedy and intense civic debate.\nT+L readers paid tribute to the qualities that have captivated the hearts of travelers from around the world.\n\"Charleston has it all,\" one reader said.\nIt's been applauded for its beautiful, jasmine-fringed neighborhoods and historic battlegrounds.\nNot far from downtown is Sullivan's Island and Folly Beach, where locals and visitors go to cool off amongst the grassy, soft sand dunes on hot summer days.\nAlso worth exploring are the galleries on Broad Street and the city's award-winning restaurants.\nAngkor Wat might be the star, but there's so much more to Siem Reap than temple ruins. 3. Siem Reap (Cambodia)\nFor adventurous travelers, this Cambodian city is nothing short of a necessary pilgrimage.\nThe unmistakable silhouette of Angkor Wat , the massive, 12th century Buddhist temple, is perhaps Siem Reap's best-known landmark.\nOther Khmer ruins, like Ta Prohm (best known for the way enormous strangler fig and silk trees root down through the sandstone structure) are like gateways into an ancient and spiritual past.\nBut this is hardly a perished city.\nAway from the ruins, along the urban center's riverfront are art galleries, where tourists can browse black-and-white prints of the striking shrines, and boutique hotels, such as the Belmond La Residence d'Angkor and Raffles Grand Hotel D'Angkor.\nTo make the most of your visit, we recommend splurging on an Angkor Wat pass, which will allow you to return throughout the day or week, for various shots of the temples in different weather and light.\nBelmond La Residence d'Angkor , River Road, Siem Reap Kingdom of Cambodia, Siem Reap Cambodia;\nRaffles Grand Hotel d'Angkor , 1 Vithei Charles de Gaulle Khum Svay Dang Kum, Siem Reap Cambodia;\n4. Florence (Italy)\nThis Italian city is a perfect example of a destination that's constantly reinventing itself and offering even veteran visitors variation and excitement.\nKnown for being a Renaissance repository with such highlights as Michelangelo's David and red-roofed buildings reflected in the river Arno, Florence is livelier than ever.\nNew art galleries, such as EX3 and Museo Novecento, feature contemporary works, and aperitivo time at the local bars lures sightseers with salumi and rustic crostini.\nThe pedestrian-friendly streets are prime for admiring (or buying) handcrafted leather goods and checking out the classical architecture.\nStill, the city is a monument to its monuments, and the magnificent Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore (known simply as Il Duomo), with features dating back to the 7th century, remains the most recognizable feature of the Florentine skyline.\nA jaw-dropping vista from the Giardini & Villa Bardini, or the impeccably restored San Niccolò tower, really puts things in perspective.\n5. Rome (Italy)\nEternal City, indeed.\nIt's impossible to tire of the capital city's storied landmarks, such as The Pantheon and The Colosseum, both relics of the Roman Empire.\nNot to mention St. Peter's Basilica and the Sistine Chapel in the sovereign Vatican, and the 2,300-year-old cobblestones that make up Appian Way.\nWhen you've had your fill of the old, a new breed of design-forward buildings have risen in brilliant contrast to the original masterworks.\nNow, you can enjoy creamy gelato in the shadows of Zaha Hadid's MAXXI Museum, starchitect Richard Meier's glass-and-travertine frame for the Ara Pacis.\nMost T+L readers agree that one trip simply is not enough.\n\"There will never be sufficient time to see all there is in Rome,\" one said.\nBangkok's Grand Palace, one of the city's top atttractions. 6. Bangkok (Thailand)\nAfter a year of unrest, Bangkok has been restored to the World's Best list, where it clung to the No. 1 spot from 2010 to 2013.\nBustle may be an understatement here, where sweet and spicy street food perfumes the avenues and gilded Buddhist temples stand in dramatic juxtaposition to slick skyscrapers.\nIt's frenetic, colorful and a curious amalgamation of past and present: tuk-tuks and monks fill the streets at dawn, their reflections cast in the steel and glass high-rises.\nAt night, Sukhumvit Soi 38 offers an equally vibrant street-side feast, where pedestrians elbow up to tables for fat rice noodles, mango sticky rice and pathong ko (Thai doughnuts) with pandan leaf custard.\nFor a moment of serenity consider heading for Wat Suthat temple, the Himalayan-style art gallery, Serindia, or jump on a long-tail boat tour along the Chao Phraya River.\n7. Krakow (Poland)\nPoland's second city has been experiencing a quiet cultural revolution, and it's finally getting the attention it deserves.\nThis World's Best debut, known for Gothic fortifications and a laid-back, blase attitude, has enchanted travelers and overcome even stalwart favorites like Istanbul and New York.\nPerhaps it's the marvels of the Old City, like Rynek Glowny -- the largest Medieval square in Europe -- and the Royal Castle of Wawel that have captivated intrepid travelers seeking something unfamiliar out of their explorations abroad.\nIn the old Jewish quarter of Kazimierz, where synagogues that survived WWII still stand, there's a notably bohemian vibe taking hold in new hip spots like Bar Propaganda, appropriately outfitted with a bust of Lenin.\nSome, however, will tell you it's the mystic chakhra stone of Wawel Hill that has bewitched the world.\n8. Barcelona (Spain)\nThis beachside city is the offbeat counterpart to Madrid.\nIt's unquestionably hip and strikes a perfect balance between its iconic attractions (the Antoni Gaudí-designed Parc Guell) and cutting-edge developments (the zinc-and-glass design center DHUB, Michelin-starred restaurant Saüc).\nMuseo Picasso is a must-see, with an impressive collection of the artist's early works.\nCatalan culture may be best appreciated through the city's renowned food scene.\nYou can grab breakfast at the Pinotxo counter inside La Boquería market, or another small-plates-centric spot, Tickets.\nHere, brothers Ferran and Albert Adria, of famed El Bulli, spin out sophisticated tapas like fascinating liquid olives and raviolis, algae tempura, and seasonal sorbets.\nFurther mad-scientist experiments can be sampled at ABaC. Think oysters tartare with fennel, and Hamachi with cherries and aptly named cucumber snow.\nCape Town: A city that really does have it all. 9. Cape Town (South Africa)\nForget everything you thought you knew about Africa.\nCape Town is cutting-edge, artsy and buzzing with energy.\nThere are few places in the world where you can exercise your shopping skills (Woodstock's Neighborgoods Market on Saturday mornings is the place to go for Afrikaans jerky and silk-and-leather sandals), take off on a safari, or enjoy world-famous cuisine all in one weekend.\nAtlantic-facing Clifton Beaches are the South Beach of South Africa, known for enormous natural boulders tumbling into the sea, pristine sunbathing conditions and the capoeira dancers that entertain crowds with fire and African drums on Monday nights.\n10. Jerusalem\nChristians, Jews, and Muslims converge to worship in this 4,000-year-old holy city, and their respective churches, synagogues and mosques surround the historic Old City.\nHere, you can tuck a miniature prayer into the Western Wall, or see a fragment of clay engraved with cuneiform at the excavation site at Temple Mount.\nThe iconic, gleaming gold Dome of the Rock is best photographed from the Austrian Hospice, which offers unparalleled views of the city and Mount of Olives.\nJerusalem, like every other city on this list, also has a stake in the contemporary and the secular.\nLuxury apartment buildings now erupt like stalagmites from the Judean Desert, and high-end restaurants, such as King's Court at the restored Waldorf Astoria, are bringing a new upmarket appeal to this arid oasis.\nWaldorf Astoria Jerusalem , 26-28 Agron Street; Intersection King David, Agron, Mamilla Sts Adjacent to Independence Park; Mamilla district, Jerusalem;", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150707104250-world-top-10-cities--cape-town-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150707104250-world-top-10-cities--cape-town-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150707104304-world-top-10-cities--siem-reap-small-169.jpg", "http://www.travelandleisure.com/worlds-best?xid=PS_CNNI", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150707104304-world-top-10-cities--siem-reap-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150707104239-world-top-10-cities--bangkok-small-11.jpg", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298564-d5977426-Reviews-m14631-The_Ritz_Carlton_Kyoto-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293983-d2141296-Reviews-m14631-Waldorf_Astoria_Jerusalem-Jerusalem_Jerusalem_District.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150707104304-world-top-10-cities--siem-reap-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150707104250-world-top-10-cities--cape-town-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150707104304-world-top-10-cities--siem-reap-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150707104239-world-top-10-cities--bangkok-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297390-d301738-Reviews-m14631-Belmond_La_Residence_d_Angkor-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297390-d301599-Reviews-m14631-Raffles_Grand_Hotel_d_Angkor-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150707104239-world-top-10-cities--bangkok-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150707104250-world-top-10-cities--cape-town-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150707104250-world-top-10-cities--cape-town-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150707104304-world-top-10-cities--siem-reap-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150707104304-world-top-10-cities--siem-reap-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150707104304-world-top-10-cities--siem-reap-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150707104239-world-top-10-cities--bangkok-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150707104239-world-top-10-cities--bangkok-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150707104239-world-top-10-cities--bangkok-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150707104250-world-top-10-cities--cape-town-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150707104239-world-top-10-cities--bangkok-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150707104250-world-top-10-cities--cape-town-full-169.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-07T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T17:54:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
