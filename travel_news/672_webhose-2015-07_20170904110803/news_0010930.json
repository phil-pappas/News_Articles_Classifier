But now upmarket buyers are switching to a more Art Deco approach, with style and substance replacing flash and brash. As you stroll through Queen’s Gate in the west of the city or centrally located Fuxing Royale, you will find installation art, subtle furnishings and smart domestic appliances in the rows of expensive homes. At Lakeville Gallery, a showroom for new luxury residence Lakeville in central Shanghai, ink-and-brush paintings and sculpture-like seats adorn the space. An Italian glass chandelier, costing about $8,000 (£5,240), lights up a $12,000 Brazilian-ebony dining table, while Japanese hand-painted silk wallpaper at $400 per square metre hangs in the gallery. “Here we talk about life-style, not just the house itself,” said Allen Taylor, general manager of product development and high-end residential sales with Shui On Development Limited. Taylor has been working in the city for more than a decade, overseeing sales at Lakeville, one of the most expensive residential brands in Shanghai. The real estate company offers apartments with prices starting at 15 million yuan (£1.59 million). Upscale villas cost more than 150 million yuan. The rich in the city have turned their back on the bling, bling splendour of Tudor or Rococo-style furniture and decorations “The rich in the city have turned their back on the bling, bling splendour of Tudor or Rococo-style furniture and decorations,” he said. “This used to be very popular. Now, it’s more tasteful, more Art Deco style. Items have a lower profile, but they could be more expensive.” Potential buyers visit the showroom for inspiration, searching for the right furniture and fittings, which could cost them up to $60,000. Every six weeks, the design display is changed and a new batch of luxury labels are brought in. Angie An, a designer with Domus Tiandi, a high-end interior design company that offers a wide range of upmarket products from all over the world, has seen a distinct change in the luxury residential property sector. “Homeowners do not want their 10 million yuan homes to look all the same or be copies from a European tourist attraction,” he said. “They want things that are unique and artistic — that fit into their lifestyles.” Luxury cupboards that can cost $20,000 and are made by Poliform in Italy and beautifully designed light fittings made by Belux in Switzerland that cost $10,000 are all the rage. So are Sub-Zero’s newest wine storage fridges from the United States which cost $15,000. Another must-have item is a gardener or at least a gardening service, which can cost $400 a month in Shanghai. “Five years ago villa owners often wanted to grow vegetables in the spacious garden attached to the villa,” Wang Jinshan, manager of Green Life Engineering in Shanghai, a company that has offered gardening services to the rich since 2009, said. “Now they want real gardens, so our business has been picking up since 2013.” At the pinnacle of the rich list for luxury property owners is a British-style butler service. This can cost $12,000 to $30,000 per year. Debrett’s, recognised globally as the organisation that trains butlers in British-style social skills and etiquette, can help provide the ideal manservant. Securing the services of a butler for that special occasion can be arranged, according to Zhang Lei, who is looking to open an agency catering to that market. The 29-year-old trained as a butler with Noahs, a butler institute in Shanghai, and is now hoping to provide that service to Shanghai’s elite. Naturally, service companies need to closely watch market trends, Tang Hua, sales director of high-end properties with Savills East China, pointed out. “It’s an age of mix-and-match, and consumers want the best in quality, not just the best for bling,” Tang said. “International schools, clubs and high-end supermarkets must all be conveniently placed. As services providers, we need to keep this in mind.” This article was originally produced and published by China Daily.
