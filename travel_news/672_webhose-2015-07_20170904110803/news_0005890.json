It’s such a diverse city – it’s very vibrant because of the students from Swansea University and beautiful because of the nature that surrounds the city. I moved out of South Wales when I was 18 to study in London and I didn’t really appreciate what was on my doorstep until after I moved away. Anything special I should pack? Walking shoes, a camera, and be prepared for a variety of weather. Everyone thinks the weather will always be rainy, but I’ve found the weather really isn’t that different to London. What’s the first thing you do when you return? I grab my mum and our little six-year-old Westie [West Highland terrier] Lily and head out on a long walk. There’s a whole network of paths that surround Swansea so one minute you’re in a fast-paced city and the next you could be standing in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. • The Gower Peninsula, Wales: the perfect break Three Cliffs Bay (Fotolia/AP) Where’s the best place to stay? The Fairyhill (01792 390139; fairyhill.net ) is a lovely luxury hotel in a stunning parkland setting. It is very discreet and private and has an award-winning restaurant which offers an incredible culinary experience. It’s run by two fabulous men who take immense pride in making everybody feel special. Where would you meet friends for a drink? Morgan’s Hotel (01792 484848; morganshotel.co.uk ) is a chic boutique hotel in the heart of Swansea and its bar is a very lively, happening place to have a drink. It’s also just on the cusp of the area where all the nightlife is. Where’s the best place for lunch? Castellamare (01792 369408; castellamare.co.uk ) is a beautiful Italian restaurant on a clifftop overlooking the bay and Mumbles lighthouse. The food there is very fresh – the fish is brought in straight off the boat – and the service is always good. The Mumbles pier (Fotolia/AP) And for dinner? The Langland Brasserie (01792 363699; langlandsbrasserie.co.uk ) is right on the Swansea seafront and is a welcome pit stop after a long clifftop walk. They serve a lovely cup of hot chocolate with marshmallows to warm you up, as well as great sharing platters and their deserts are to-die-for. It’s open until late and they do good breakfasts and lunches too. Where would you send a first-time visitor? My favourite view is Three Cliffs Bay which has an expansive beach, marked by three weather-worn cliffs. It’s so spectacularly beautiful. I always take anyone who comes to visit me there and they’re always blown away by it. It’s a great place for a picnic and has been a popular shooting location for music videos – the band Red Hot Chilli Peppers have shot there previously. If you’re a runner like me, start at the university and run out to Mumbles Pier and back. It’s a flat run, so nothing too taxing, and you take in the waterfront. It’s 10km in total. Every time I go home, I do that at least once. I never get bored of it because of the changing views every season. What should I avoid? Swansea can have quite a reputation for its rowdy nightlife, which will appeal to some and not to others. There’s one big street, Wind Street, that becomes pedestrianised in the evenings and it’s lined with restaurants, bars and clubs. You can have an amazing time there, but it can be easily avoided. Swansea marina (Fotolia/AP) Public transport or taxi? It’s easy to get to Swansea from somewhere like London – there’s a train that takes less than three hours and Swansea is the end of the line, so you can’t miss it! Once in Swansea, there’s a good public transport network, but I’d recommend hiring a bike. You can cover a distance easily and you’re not beholden to a timetable. • Joanna Page's Swansea What should I bring home? Welsh cakes – they’re somewhere between a scone and a pancake. They’re very flat and made on a griddle. They’re absolutely delicious; I can’t resist them when I go back to Swansea, so I always pop into a local bakery and bring some back home. Welsh cakes (Fotolia/AP) Anywhere that isn’t your kind of town? I don’t have one really, but I prefer places that are very nature-based where I can enjoy the outdoors or I like towns with a rich culture and history. My husband Andrew [the American artist/film-maker Andrew Levitas] is drawn to art, so we like destinations that combine both. Venice, Paris, Melbourne and Miami are my favourite cities.
