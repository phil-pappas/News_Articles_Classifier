And an expensive one at that: Its $130,000-per-week cost can drive anyone to drink (which would probably defeat the purpose here).\nStill, the ritzy rehab resort is good enough for George Michael, he of high faith, who apparently checked into the centre, it was reported in June.\nReportedly the world’s most expensive recovery program, Kusnacht Practice treats, among other ailments, personality and eating disorders, depression and anxiety, and drug, alcohol and gambling addiction.\nOne of the rooms inside the Kusnacht Practice.

Kusnacht justifies its sky-high costs with its distinctive, highly personalised edge, treating one client at a time — and no more than 30 per year, according to reviews.\n“We offer much more than beautiful locations and excellent Swiss service,” boasts the site.\nIndeed: Upon arriving at the airport, clients are greeted by a personal driver and therapist, who whisks them to the facility, where they can receive acupuncture treatments and call on butlers and their very own personal chefs at a moment’s notice.\nChef on call? Yes please.

Each client also has a personal trainer and yoga instructor at his beck and call.\nAnd don’t forget the VIP concierge service.\nTheir “global reach” can surely please even the most discerning 12-stepper with fine dining, personal shopping, private jet and yacht charters, and more.\nThe perfect place to unwind ... at a price.
