Thus, even more international passengers can get information and advice in their native language about the FRA global hub. These additional languages complement information already being offered in German, English, and Chinese (Mandarin) via about 100 self-serve information kiosks conveniently located in Terminals 1 and 2. \nFor example, these information kiosks allow passengers, meeters & greeters, and visitors to find out the current status of a flight – including any changes to arrival or departure times, the designated gate, and other useful information. Each kiosk has a quick-scan feature, whereby the traveler simply places his boarding card on the scanning area so that the barcode can be read. The kiosk immediately displays the relevant flight information. The information kiosks also provide information on the wide range of shops, restaurants, and other services available at Frankfurt Airport. \nIf travelers and visitors wish to have personal assistance, they can get help and information from multilingual service staff circulating throughout the terminals, or they can go to one of Fraport airport company’s staffed information counters and service points. \nA number of handy FRA booklets such as the Airport Guide, Transfer Guide and Shopping & Dining Guide are available online in many languages at Frankfurt-airport.com (also for downloading). Printed versions in German and English can be picked up in the terminals. \nThe multilingual information kiosks at Frankfurt Airport are part of the “Great to have you here!” service quality program launched by Fraport AG (the owner and manager of FRA) with the goal of continually enhancing the travel experience at Germany’s largest aviation hub. Other services under this program include the Frankfurt Airport App 2.0 and free 24-hour Wi-Fi Internet access offered in the passenger terminals. More details about Frankfurt Airport’s wide range of services and facilities are available via FRA’s travel website and social media channels on on Twitter , Facebook , Youtube .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T23:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T02:02:17.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
