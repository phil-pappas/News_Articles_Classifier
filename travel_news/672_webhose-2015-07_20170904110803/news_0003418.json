According to HSI, “many of these dogs had never seen sunlight or received any veterinary care. Mothers were forced to give birth time after time.”\nFollowing the rescue, all dogs underwent check-ups and vets found that eight dogs were pregnant, some of them at high risk of death because of their age. “Others had severe eye infections, bad teeth, ear problems, scabies, extremely long nails, and poorly healed broken bones, among other problems,” HSI reported.\nHSI Latin America director Cynthia Dent said “no animal should be forced to live in deplorable conditions such as those in which we found these 64 dogs. We are grateful to SENASA and ANPA for allowing us to collaborate.”\nThe dogs will now be neutered and put up for adoption. “We hope that the suffering they endured for so long will soon be just a distant memory for all of them, particularly the mothers, and that their newborn pups can play on the grass instead of living in stacked cages,” Dent said.\nIn spite of the mild punishment, animal rights’ leaders were happy with the conviction, mostly because it was the first here against an illegal puppy mill, according to HSI.\n“This ruling sets an important legal precedent and it also will be a warning for puppy mill owners about the consequences of animal cruelty,” ANPA president Gisela Vico said.\nThe Animal Welfare Bill (#18,298), which seeks harsher penalties for animal cruelty, is still pending approval in the Legislative Assembly.\nIn November, 2014, President Luis Guillermo Solís promised animal rights advocates that the bill’s approval “would be a priority of his administration.” Lawmakers, however, have yet to prioritize the bill’s discussion and approval by the full Assembly.", "external_links": ["http://www.hsi.org/spanish/", "http://www.senasa.go.cr/senasa/sitio/"], "published": "2015-07-24T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T21:08:15.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
