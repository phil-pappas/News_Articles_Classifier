A photo with Santa, for many families, is a Christmas must - even if the child protests. ALFRED EISENSTAEDT / Getty Images 1. A Visit to Santa \nWhether it's a visit to the local shopping mall's Santa Claus or a more elaborately staged visit, Christmas time offers children lots of opportunity for a photo-op on Santa's knee. \nMany parks, like Mountsberg Conservation Area in Hamilton, offer magical Santa visits that include a horse-drawn sleigh ride under the stars to Santa's workshop and personal face-time with the big man himself. Finding the ugliest Christmas sweater has become a holiday tradition. Getty Images 2. Ugly Sweaters \nBecoming more and more popular is the tradition of finding the ugliest sweater and wearing it to the office or Christmas party. Ugly sweaters are actually sweaters worn at one time in a festive good will gesture and can now be found at thrift shops who recognize the demand for these fashion offenders every year.

Santa Claus Parades \nSanta Claus Parades are held beginning mid-November through mid-December in large cities and small towns. Aside from the big man himself, Santa parades will generally have Christmas-theme floats, marching bands and local clubs. Popular ones such as in Toronto and Vancouver draw hundreds of thousands of people and often require an early arrival for a decent viewing spot. Small town parades aren't as busy and sometimes have more charm. Butter tarts are especially popular during the holidays. Photo Â© S. McLean 4. Butter Tarts & More \nCanada has many unique culinary offerings around holiday time. Butter tarts are a popular baked treat, akin to pecan pie, made with - you guessed it - a ton of butter and sugar. \nTourtiere ( tor-tee- air ) is a popular Quebecois meat pie that is popular during the winter months, especially Christmas Eve. \nNanaimo bars , the rich, creamy, chocolatey dessert square from British Columbia get the Christmas treatment with dyed green and red dyed centres.

Winter Lights Festivals \nLight festivals are a tradition beginning in November and continuing through Christmas and New Year holidays. Niagara Falls, for example has a light show that includes an illuminated 5-km route of lighted displays, fireworks over the falls and more, including concerts and children's performances. Toronto has a one-night-only Christmas tree lighting accompanied by fireworks and live music.<p>Smaller locales will hold tree-lighting ceremonies as well. Snowmobiling in Canada on Christmas day is a tradition for many families in Alberta. Datacraft Co Ltd / Getty Images 6. Snowmobiling on Chrismas Day \nIn Alberta anyway, snowmobiling is a popular Christmas day activity, weather permitting. Probably not the safest thing in the world, kids are towed behind snowmobiles on sleds, often ending up in a snowbank in fits of laughter.

It may come from a tradition in the U.K. in which household employers boxed gifts for their servants), Boxing Day is a one-day shopping extravaganza the day after Christmas when retailers slash prices in order to unload Christmas inventory. Go early and get your \"Boxing Day gloves\" on. Christmas carolers may show up to your door around the holidays to serenade you. Digital Vision. / Getty Images 8. Christmas Caroling \nThough it's a tradition that seems to be fading, Christmas carolers can still be spotted at malls or if you are lucky enough, in your own neighbourhood or front door singing traditional Christmas songs. <p>In some public places, carolers have been banned as they are seen as too specifically Christian and not embracing of a multiple of religions and faiths.
