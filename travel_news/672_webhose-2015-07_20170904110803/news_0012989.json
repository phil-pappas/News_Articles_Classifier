Literally.\nThe new operating system is the first, and thus far the only, to include support for the “Reversed Hand with Middle Finger Extended” emoji — aka, the middle finger. As Emojipedia reports , despite the fact that Unicode, the global standards organization for emoji, made the character available more than a year ago, most tech companies have been really, really skittish about giving this particular emoji a go.\nIt’s odd to see major tech companies, like Apple and Google, assume the role of propriety police. It is, admittedly, in keeping with some of their other moralistic design choices: Both iPhone and Android phones don’t recognize swear words, for instance, and Apple’s official dictionary purportedly excludes thousands of other “controversial” words , besides: things like abortion, prostitution, pornography and suicide.\nLet’s leave aside, for a second, the issue of whether software should even have that kind of soft-censorship power. There’s another argument to be made against Apple and Google’s finger-wagging: Namely, that the finger isn’t all that offensive in 2015.\nCertainly the gesture raises eyebrows, and tempers, in many more polite circles. But it’s also become a more casual expression of protest, annoyance, excitement and rage, deployed readily by everyone from politicians and government ministers to athletes and celebrities . The middle finger has become “so well ingrained in everyday life in this country and others,” the law professor Ira Robbins told the BBC , that it simply doesn’t carry quite the same shock now as it did in, oh, 400 B.C.\nAlas, change comes slowly — even in tech. Case in point: Windows 10 will display the middle-finger emoji if you view the character on a website or copy/paste it from somewhere else. But it will still not include the character in its built-in emoji keyboard. At least, not yet.\nDewey writes The Post’s The Intersec t web channel covering digital and Internet culture.\n© 2015 , The Washington Post", "external_links": ["http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/07/16/the-apple-kill-list-what-your-iphone-doesn-t-want-you-to-type.html", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/mia-creates-a-stir-with-super-bowl-halftime-performance/2012/02/06/gIQApMK7uQ_story.html", "http://blog.emojipedia.org/windows-10-emoji-changelog", "http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16916263", "http://www.businessinsider.com/yanis-varoufakis-middle-finger-controversy-real-fake-bohmermann-jauch-2015-3", "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/12/13/susan-rice-s-middle-finger-and-the-world-s-deadliest-wars.html", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2014/08/22/johnny-manziel-reportedly-fined-12000-for-middle-finger-incident-during-redskins-game/"], "published": "2015-07-31T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T00:13:34.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
