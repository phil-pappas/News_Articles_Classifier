Inside a run-down warehouse in the London borough of Walthamstow is an idea that could be the undoing of the Islamic State.\nThe graffiti-covered space is filled with couches that have seen better days and copies of the Koran mixed with PCs for dummies. But it’s also home to the Active Change Foundation , an organisation that has managed to achieve things politicians with billion-dollar budgets cannot, stopping the flow of teenagers to Syria one person at a time.\n“It’s about doing exactly as the extremists are doing online and offline, mirroring their tactics because it’s a successful approach,” said CEO and founder Hanif Qadir.\n“It’s not just a centre that you come in and you can go and play pool, these are all tools of engagement and you do that in the most gentle and least intrusive way.”\nThe centre is the front line in a huge and growing threat that is indiscriminately targeting teenagers and “stealing” them out of their bedrooms. Mr Qadir said since he first saw the black banners rising in the Middle East three years ago it has become the major threat to young people in his North London borough, not to mention international security.\nIn the last six months the foundation has stopped seven teens with bags packed ready to fly to Syria — a mixture of young men and women from Muslim and non-Muslim backgrounds. That’s on top of 120 people they prevented joining terrorist networks in the last five years and just a handful of the thousands they come into contact with each year in a bid to counter extremism in all forms.\n“In the last two years it’s increased steadily but in the last six months it’s increased rapidly,” Mr Qadir said about the number of people leaving for IS.\n“That’s because the IS narrative is a very potent, very strong brand and it works in community dynamics. It works not just in your street environment but in the bedroom in the house itself because of the access to social media.”\nMr Qadir with other members of the Active Change Foundation who have used social media to get their message across.

I even got more angered against them than I did against the Americans to tell the truth. It was a very hostile situation. I’m very lucky to be alive.”\nHe sold his business to start the centre but struggled to get recognition for his work. On the verge of bankruptcy, a 2006 plot to blow up an airline hatched by 14 people in the borough led others to sit up and listen.\nThe organisation now has government funding and is responsible for the #NotinMyName campaign which reached 300 million people around the world and was raised by President Obama at the UN. Their latest campaign #MessagetoISIS is fronted by Mr Qadir’s daughter and designed to beat the terrorist group at their own game.\n“It allows young people to see the truth from an individual who is not locked up, who doesn’t feel he is being spied upon,” Mr Qadir said about the centre’s non-judgemental approach.\n“We bring truth and reality to the ground to the people who ordinarily wouldn’t accept that.”\nMessage to ISIS\nGlasgow schoolgirl Asqa Mahmood is believed to have fled to Syria.

Other families like that of Melbourne teen Jake Bilardi struggle to realise what is happening before it’s too late and blame themselves for missing the warning signs.\nMr Qadir said it’s easy to see why young people are drawn towards the terrifying brand when simplified information is dumped online and they are shut down by parents, teachers and leaders.\n“Our job is to raise that curiosity — to throw a spanner in the works — if they’re on a trajectory towards violent extremism then our job is to raise their curiosity about the extremists they’re gravitating towards.”\nTo donate to The Active Change Foundation click here.\nVictoria.craw@news.com.au Australia's Jihadis 25:16 Play video\nA troubling insight into why so many young Australians are risking their lives to join ISIS.\nOovvuu 26 May 2015 TV/Politics TV/Religion TV/Current Affairs TV/Society and Culture\nOriginally published as The low-tech solution killing IS", "external_links": ["http://www.isisnotinmyname.com/", "http://www.news.com.au/world/europe/boy-pleads-guilty-in-the-uk-to-anzac-day-melbourne-terror-plot/story-fnh81p7g-1227454506087", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://videomam.news.com.au.s3.amazonaws.com/generated/prod/05/26/2015/121835/image1024x768.jpg?count=1&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/jake-bilardis-dad-tells-of-warning-signs-when-teenage-suicide-bomber-was-a-young-boy/story-e6frfmyi-1227274049263", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/31/1227464/812803-a3337626-35d9-11e5-8996-1850b37d48c6.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/active-change-foundation-is-helping-prevent-radicalisation-one-teenager-at-a-time/story-fnq2o7dd-1227464812943", "http://www.activechangefoundation.org/donate/", "http://www.activechangefoundation.org/", "http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/sep/07/plane-bomb-plot-trial-verdicts", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/31/1227464/812775-a7756022-36b6-11e5-b159-57caeec80925.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/31/1227464/812887-c26ad52a-35d9-11e5-8996-1850b37d48c6.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/31/1227464/810786-a2859a46-36b6-11e5-b159-57caeec80925.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/31/1227464/810708-a5498300-36b6-11e5-b159-57caeec80925.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYBUtb0NU9o"], "published": "2015-08-01T02:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T13:22:54.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
