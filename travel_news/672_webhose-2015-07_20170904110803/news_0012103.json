It captures in my mind almost a Victorian elegance with the curved ironwork the and lights that have the luminescence of gas. There is a large shipping centre right in the heart of Dublin Allen CHQ and that too has been mostly empty since it opened. It is design in a long wide hall that you can see from end to end, and the whole centre is lined with chairs for the non existent coffee shops and restaurant and that wide open space feels ghostly if you are the only person there. I am sure things will turnaround and this place will bustle again, in the meantime you have an architectural beauty to enjoy.
