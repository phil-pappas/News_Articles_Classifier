In total, seven weekly non-stop flights from East Coast cities New York, Boston and Baltimore/Washington DC will start on December 3rd 2015. \nUnder the \"Open Skies Treaty” between the U.S and the E.U., European airline Norwegian will connect the French Caribbean Guadeloupe Islands to three major East coast gateways. Service will operate as follows: \nTo and from Pointe-A-Pitre (PTP), Guadeloupe. FWI \n• New York (JFK) – Three times weekly on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays \n• Baltimore/Washington, D.C. (BWI) - Twice weekly on Tuesdays and Saturdays \n• Boston (BOS) - Twice weekly on Thursdays and Sundays \n“This additional airlift with Norwegian from New York, Boston and Baltimore / Washington D.C. is historic for our destination. It rewards an efficient global development strategy implemented on the US market, since the opening of our New York Office in November 2012. The continued growth of American visitors to the Guadeloupe Islands is key to the diversification of our visitorship. Accessibility from the East Coast has been a cornerstone of our US strategy since most of our U.S. visitors come from those East Coast gateways. The partnership with Norwegian, the world’s fastest growing airline, is an excellent opportunity for more East Coasters to finally tick the Guadeloupe Islands off their bucket lists” says Hilaire Brudey, Chairman for the Guadeloupe Islands Tourist Board. \nNorwegian operates one of the world’s most modern and eco-friendly fleets. On the U.S.-Caribbean routes, the airline will fly its new Boeing 737-800s with 186 comfortable, leather seats and it will be the first airline to offer free Wi-Fi on flights to the Caribbean. With the new service, Norwegian will offer US-based customers some of the lowest fares to the Caribbean, with an introductory fare starting at $79 one way, valid from all three U.S. airports and starting at $99 one way from Guadeloupe (PTP). \n\"Since 2012 U.S arrivals have increased by 29%, building year after year as Americans discover our unspoiled destination. The increasing demand of Americans in experiential travel and Eco Tourism have made the French Archipelago of Guadeloupe a perfect match for educated adventure travelers, sailors and long time Francophiles. The affordable Norwegian airfare will attract younger travelers in search of pristine natural settings and unpretentious atmosphere \"says Sandra Venite, USA Regional Manager, Guadeloupe Islands Tourist Board. \nTo celebrate Norwegian’s new routes, the airline has partnered with the Guadeloupe Islands Tourist Board to launch a sweepstakes for one lucky person in Boston, Baltimore/Washington D.C. and New York City metro areas to win a trip for two to the archipelago, including flights on Norwegian and six nights at one of the islands’ top resorts: La Creole Beach Hotel & Spa, Langley Fort Royal Resort and Auberge de la Vieille Tour Hotel.
