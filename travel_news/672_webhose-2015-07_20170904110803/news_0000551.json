The exhibition is continuing despite allegations by more than two dozen women that Cosby committed sexual misconduct in the past four decades. Several say he drugged and raped them. Smithsonian spokeswoman Linda St. Thomas says the museum will install the sign Wednesday. She says the sign will essentially say the museum does not condone Cosby's behavior. The Cosby art collection features African-American artists long under-appreciated by museums. Court documents have revealed Cosby admitted under oath that he obtained Quaaludes to give to women with whom he wanted to have sex.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T00:52:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
