We’ve found summer-ready lightweight sacks and snuggled into durable winter bags better suited for snowy climes.\nWhen making your choice, it’s important to consider a bag's season and temperature ratings. Confusingly, the numbered sleeping bag seasons don’t correspond to the four seasons: a season 1 bag is suitable for the hot summer months in the UK, or when camping abroad in hotter countries, season 2 for generic late-spring to early-autumn, season 3 for early-spring to late-autumn, and season 4 for winter use in temperatures below zero. You may also come across a season 5 bag, which are more commonly known as expedition bags and are designed for mountain use and extreme cold.\nTemperature ratings offer a more specific guide and are usually listed with comfort and extreme ratings. The comfort rating is fairly self-explanatory, denoting the temperature under which you will start to feel the cold. The extreme rating is the temperature at which the bag will protect you from dangers such as frostbite and hypothermia and keep you alive over short periods; we recommend you don’t push this one too much.\nOther variations to consider are carrying weight and pack size, a mummy or rectangular shape, whether the case is sufficiently waterproof to risk carrying it outside your backpack, and whether you want synthetic (bulkier and heavier than down but keeps in heat when wet) or down (light, easier to compress and retains heat better, but loses it when wet).\n1. Snugpack Travelpack 2: £35.16, aboveandbeyond.co.uk\nThis comes with an in-built, roll-away mosquito net, making it an ideal choice for backpackers braving malarial zones. Great for summer months, it weighs in at 1.1kg and it’s possible to seal the bag (when you’re not in it) to keep unwanted creepy-crawly visitors out.\nBuy now\n2. Marmot Trestles 30: £84.99, surfdome.com\nIf you ever needed a bag to hide away from the world in, this would be your best bet. Insulated with a blend of hollow and polyester fibres, it’s exceptionally warm, making it perfect for colder backpacking trips. It comes with a face muff so you can tuck yourself right in and the easy-stuff bag saves time in the morning.\nBuy now\n3. Coleman Pathfinder: £39.99, completeoutdoors.co.uk\nOffering toasty warmth between late spring and autumn, this bag is slightly heavier than the others at 1.7kg, but has double layer insulation to keep you snug between -2 and 3 degrees.

Vango Ultralite 900: £90, vango.com\nThis 1.5kg bag is great for a cold trip (suitable for conditions as low as -20).

OE X Roam 100: £20, gooutdoors.co.uk\nIdeal for camping in temperatures of around 10 degrees, this is the cheapest bag on our list, and weighs in at 900g.

Nordisk Oscar +5 Sleeping £190: £190, cotswoldoutdoor.com\nWeighing in at 500g, this is the most lightweight sack on the list and, thanks to the zip up the front, you can comfortably sit up in it and still keep your feet warm.

The North Face Aleutian 20/-7: £99.99, surfdome.com\nThis is a fairly heavy bag at 1.6kg, but one that’ll keep you warm in temperatures as low as -7 degrees, making it ideal for winter adventures. Great for eco-warriors, 30 per cent of the insulation is made from recycled material and it’s completely synthetic so dries out quickly.\nBuy now\n10. Aerolite 1000 Mummy: £70, blacks.co.uk\nIf you need a super-light bag for winter camping, then this is a great choice: it’s only 980g and has a survival temperature of -16 degrees, thanks to a double layer of hollow-fibre stuffing. The compression sack maximises your pack space and the bag’s tough “ripstop” fabric means it will last for trips for years to come.\nBuy now\nVerdict:\nIf you’re after a lightweight sleeping bag that’ll pack down tightly and works well for the summer, we think the Snugpack Travelpack 2 is a practical choice, especially as it comes with a handy mosquito net. For those backpacking in mountainous areas or during the winter might want to check out the Aerolite 1000 , which will protect you against even the chilliest elements.\nTweet @Ellieross102\nRead more:\n10 best backpacking tents\n10 best family-sized tents", "external_links": ["https://www.surfdome.com/marmot_sleeping_bags_-_marmot_trestles_30_sleeping_bag_-_dark_grass/greener_pastures-215252", "http://www.vango.co.uk/gb/trekking/714-ultralite-900.html", "http://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com/us/nordisk-oscar-5-sleeping-bag-82310177?id_colour=6325", "https://twitter.com/EllieRoss102", "http://www.coleman.eu/UK/p-26304-pathfinder.aspx", "http://www.aboveandbeyond.co.uk/products/8211650366039/snugpak-sleeping-bag-travelpak-2", "http://www.halfords.com/motoring-travel/camping-caravanning/sleeping-bags-air-beds/urban-escape-ultralight--mummy-sleeping-bag", "http://www.gooutdoors.co.uk/oex-roam-100-sleeping-bag-p321712", "http://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com/ayacucho-lite-700-sleeping-bag-82110073?id_colour=133", "https://www.surfdome.com/the_north_face_sleeping_bags_-_the_north_face_aleutian_20/-7_sleeping_bag_-_striker_blue/zinc_grey-205528"], "published": "2015-07-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T21:43:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
