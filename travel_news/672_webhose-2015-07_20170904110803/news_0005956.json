The Global Travel Group’s Managing Director, Andy Stark commented: “It’s encouraging to hear that the ongoing economic turmoil in Greece is not deterring British holidaymakers from booking trips to the country. Enquiries and bookings are on the up, showcasing once again that us Brits are savvy when it comes to a good deal, informed and will travel this summer regardless of the country’s economic problems. “Our agents are reporting some stand out deals to Greece and its islands at the moment. Travellers are snapping these up and heading out to enjoy the sunshine. I would encourage anyone travelling to Greece to keep abreast of the situation and ensure they take the relevant measures with cash to ensure they are well prepared, but firmly believe that a holiday to Greece right now is a good idea all round.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T17:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T00:27:27.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
