According to a study for the Wall Street Journal by masFlight, a flight tracking and data firm that works with airline schedule publisher OAG, the number of U.S. airline flights has fallen by 11,475 since July 2011, a reduction of nearly 7 percent. Nevertheless, San Francisco International, the 11 th busiest U.S. airport ranked by number of flights, saw a 4.18 percent increase over the same period. No. 34 Oakland International had a 7.42 percent increase. And No. 42 Mineta San Jose International had a 6.41 percent increase. Subscribe to SVBJ's free morning email newsletter. San Francisco’s schedules this July show 3,690 flights per week against 3,532 flights per week in 2011. Oakland and San Jose are much smaller operations. Oakland has 1,013 flights per week this year vs. 943 per week in 2011; San Jose has 946 flights per week this year vs. 889 in 2011. The national cutbacks come during a period that the U.S. Justice Department is investigating airlines for evidence of collusion allegedly designed to boost airfares. While the number of national domestic flights was cut 6.8 percent, the Journal’s report found that the number of available seats increased by 2.2 percent – more than 388,000 seats per week – primarily because of squeezing more seats into planes. Some cities, led by former Delta hub Memphis, Tenn., have seen flights cut by two-thirds. After Memphis, the largest cuts at sizable airports were at Milwaukee (-45.2 percent), Cleveland (-44.6 percent), Colorado Springs (-41.9 percent) and Washington Dulles International (-25.12 percent). Airports experiencing the largest increases were primarily smaller airports such as Kona, Hawaii (+31 percent) or secondary airports in larger cities such as St. Petersburg/Clearwater, Fla. (+93.9 percent, main airport Tampa International), Orlando Sanford, Fla. (+71.4 percent, main airport Orlando International) or Dallas Love Field (+37.9 percent, main airport Dallas-Fort Worth). Fifteenth-ranked Seattle was the only major airport with a double-digit flight increase with 24.9 percent more flights per week since July 2011. That increase is due to Delta creating a Pacific Northwest hub at SeaTac, where it is battling hometown Alaska Airlines for airport domination. \nWant San Jose Travel   Home of the Day", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T19:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T21:09:14.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
