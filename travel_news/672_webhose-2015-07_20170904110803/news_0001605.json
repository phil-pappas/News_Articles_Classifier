Adv: \nBy Prof. Wolfgang H. Thome, eTN Africa Correspondent | Jul 13, 2015 Adv: \nFastjet PLC just announced their June figures for the operation in Tanzania, which, as expected, again showed a significant improvement on most data except for the load factors. In June the loadfactor dropped by 10 percent from last year to 69 percent, largely due to the launch of a new service from Dar es Salaam to Lilongwe / Malawi. \nPassenger numbers however are up by 23 percent compared to June a year ago, inspite of reduced domestic travel in Tanzania during the month of Ramadan, a sign that the airlineâ€™s new routes have translated into additional passenger numbers. On time departures also remain in the mid 90 percent range with a dispatch reliability of 95 percent. \nWhile recently in Harare it could also be confirmed that the fourth Airbus A319 will in fact be deployed to Zimbabwe to commence operations when the airline passes the final audit stages for their AOC. The commencement of flights will beat Zambia to the door, but a fifth Airbus A319 had already been secured to join the fleet for deployment to Lusaka, when the same process has been completed in Zambia.
