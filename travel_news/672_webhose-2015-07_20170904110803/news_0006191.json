Dead lifts alone account for 50% of my income.\nI pondered on writing this article as I may do myself out of business, but my good conscience got the better of me ... Haha.\nMost of these injuries come from a mixture of poor technique and a lack in mobility/flexibility. Mobility is a necessity to move safely and avoid injuries. There is a certain level of mobility you will need to be able to execute moves such as a squat, without causing injury to areas like your lower back, knees and neck etc.\nWhen the lower back is injured, not only does it affect your ability to do the things you love, it can decrease the power in your legs, effect your lower digestive system, decrease libido and make you an overall grumpier version of your former self.\nI’ve compiled some of the best stretches and mobilisations from ‘The Robards Method’ exercise and wellbeing program which is due to be released in August.\nThe exercises should be ideally performed most days if you want to get results as soon as possible. As always, if you have a history of chronic disease, injuries or are very new to exercise, always consult your primary healthcare practitioner before attempting any type of exercise or stretching program.\nNo more skipping leg day!\nSpinal twist three part glute stretch\n• Start by lying on your back with your foot resting on your opposite knee and push your pelvis into the ground as you push your knee out with your hand.\nPush your knee out with your hand.

Source: Supplied\n• Next, keep the knee high and take it over to the side while allowing minimal movement from the pelvis so you get a good glute and lower back stretch.\nTaking the knee over to the side gives you a great lower back stretch.

Source: Supplied\n• Deep squat position, bum is touching wall or as close to wall as possible.\n• Belly button to spine, try create gap between lower back while pushing knees out wider.\n• You should feel the stretch in your hips while trying to create a small gap between the ground and your lower back (neutral spine).\n• Hold for 20 seconds and repeat 3 times.\nDeep squat overhead push\nAnd of course doing it with your shirt off gives you extra results. Source: Supplied\n• Feet shoulder width slightly turned out, knees wide as you take bum to ground.\n• Maintain vertical spine and arms straight at 1.5 x shoulder width.\n• Raise and lower the band behind your head and back up with your breathing, while maintaining a straight spine.\n• Hold for 20 seconds and repeat 3 times.\nDr Tim Robards is a Chiropractor and exercise scientist (B.
