The reality of life is that there is no 'them’ - only an 'us’ - and one man who takes this to heart more than most is The Prince of Wales . It is exactly five years since HRH launched The Prince’s Countryside Fund , and during the course of that time, countless upland farmers, drystone wallers and other small country endeavours have been given financial as well as moral support, saving their livelihoods and allowing them to contribute their unique talents to the benefit of the British countryside. The fund really does seem to reach those parts of our treasured landscape that the bankers and other investors turn their backs upon, and countless countrymen and women have cause to be grateful for its existence. The beautiful British countryside (Alamy) By way of a celebration, next week - from 20-26 July - the fund is organising National Countryside Week , encouraging us to get out into the wilds of the landscape to enjoy it, to support it and to appreciate it. Yes, you can contribute to the fund if you so wish, knowing that your donation will go to the heart of the matter, where it really counts, and that you will be doing your bit to support those who regard the responsibility for shaping our landscape as a privilege, not a chore, but you can also enrich your own life, simply by being out in the fresh air and walking among meadows and hedgerows, over moorland and mountain, by rivers and streams, canals and country lanes, just looking and noticing and caring about what is there every day of the year and without which our lives would be the poorer, both physically and spiritually. You can visit a project sponsored by the fund, or set up your own fundraising event. And if you simply don’t have the time to spare, when you are out doing the weekly shop at the supermarket, choose those products that are marked with the PCF logo, knowing that by doing so you will be supporting British farmers and growers and encouraging them in their endeavours. Blossoming hawthorn trees (Alamy) This year the countryside seems to me to have been more beautiful than ever thanks, I suspect, to the warmth of the sun which ripened the wood last summer. We’ve enjoyed a welter of blossom in the hedgerows - from blackthorn to hawthorn, honeysuckle to sweet briar - clouds of cow parsley have erupted on roadside verges and more marguerites - moon daisies - than I can ever recall have turned their heads towards the sun as morning has journeyed towards twilight. But the summer is not over yet. The soft blue of field scabious and the rich purple of knapweed are only just beginning to open their flowers and enrich the midsummer tapestry of the meadows. So don’t miss the opportunity to get out and soothe your fevered brow during National Countryside Week . You’ll find full details on The Prince's Countryside Fund website.
