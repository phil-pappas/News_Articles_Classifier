Once the flights begin, Frontier will fly nonstop to 13 destinations from the city, including: Atlanta; Austin; Chicago O'Hare; Cleveland; Cincinnati; Denver; Orlando; St. Louis; and Washington Dulles.\nOn one route in particular — Las Vegas-San Francisco (SFO) — Frontier will try to turn a profit on what's become an ultra-competitive city-pair . Frontier will become the fifth carrier to fly nonstop between those airports, joining United, Southwest, Virgin America and JetBlue. Adding to the mix, two airlines — Southwest and Spirit — also fly between Las Vegas and SFO's cross-bay neighbor, Oakland International.\nUSA TODAY\nJetBlue adds to competition on Las Vegas-San Francisco route\nUSA TODAY\nFrontier removes departure time from boarding passes\nElsewhere, Frontier will add two routes from both Philadelphia and Orlando. All eight of the new routes included in Tuesday's announcement will begin Oct. 25. (Scroll down for a full list.)\nFrom Philadelphia, the new service will give Frontier 10 seasonal or year-round routes, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer . It continues a reshaping of Frontier's operations in the greater Philadelphia area.\nThe carrier announced last month that it was ending all service at Delaware's Wilmington/New Castle Airport , about a 30-mile drive from Philadelphia International. That came after a quick build-up and nearly equally quick draw-down for Frontier there.\nUSA TODAY\nFrontier Airlines' pullout leaves Delaware with no flights\nUSA TODAY\nFrontier announces major expansion for Atlanta\nFrontier also has built up a base at another nearby airport: New Jersey's Trenton-Mercer Airport. Frontier now flies 11 routes from that airport, which is located between the New York City and Philadelphia metro areas. The airport is about 45 miles from Philadelphia International and 75 from Midtown Manhattan.\nFrontier once flew a peak of 18 routes from Trenton, but has pared that down to the current 11.\n\"We're focusing in Trenton on routes and on markets that work seven days a week,\" Daniel Shurz, Frontier Airlines' chief commercial officer, tells the Inquirer . \"We're moving in the direction of flying the vast majority of our network on a daily basis.\"\nDetails on all eight of Frontier's newly announced routes\nLas Vegas-Houston Bush Intercontinental: One daily round-trip flight on Airbus A319 aircraft\nLas Vegas-Miami: One daily round-trip flight on Airbus A319 aircraft\nLas Vegas-Milwaukee: One daily round-trip flight on Airbus A319 aircraft\nLas Vegas-San Francisco: One daily round-trip flight on Airbus A320 aircraft\nOrlando-Indianapolis: One daily round-trip flight on Airbus A320 aircraft\nOrlando-Los Angeles: One daily round-trip flight on Airbus A319 aircraft\nPhiladelphia-Fort Myers: One daily round-trip flight, except Tuesdays, on Airbus A320 aircraft\nPhiladelphia-Montego Bay, Jamaica: Three weekly flights on Airbus A319 aircraft\nTWITTER: You can follow me at twitter.com/TodayInTheSky\n16 CONNECT 34 TWEET 4 LINKEDIN 2 //usat.ly/1I1zrQI TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/06/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635693742840970720-frontier-new2.jpg", "https://twitter.com/TodayInTheSky", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a9626a41d97e52891a85a72f6e155499d1a60067/c=98-64-909-674&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/06/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635693742840970720-frontier-new2.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8b43da0c397790f4c35185772e26b195cb44cb9c/c=954-0-2960-2006/local/-/media/2015/02/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/635603702953742962-AP-Economy.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/48cc19de80fd5082693d8021b037a3e9473b65b5/c=144-0-896-752/local/-/media/2015/06/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635693742840970720-frontier-new2.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1I1zrQI", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3cf1f87e4daa59dfdec7f8424e1d0d316029fdde/c=744-0-3892-3148/local/-/media/USATODAY/None/2014/10/07/635482706589322831-AP-Airline-Travel.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1I1zrQI&text=Eight%20new%20routes%3A%20Frontier%20Airlines%20connects%20the%20dots%20on%20its%20route%20map&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/30ccff10088ef99d51a30cdf5b22b402c1b77263/c=179-0-1091-912/local/-/media/2015/06/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635693742080456095-frontier.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1I1zrQI&mini=true", "http://www.philly.com/philly/business/transportation/20150729_Frontier_Airlines_to_add_flights_from_PHL_to_Ft__Myers__Montego_Bay.html"], "published": "2015-07-29T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T11:13:10.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
