Sometimes, there’s no better feeling than borrowing some childish fun back off the kids. And if that fun involves stalking your mates with weaponry along mist-shrouded catwalks and through dark mazes while you try to take each other out to the sound of pumping music… well, so much the better. Laser Quest is the nearest thing you can get to starring in an XBox game, with light, modular packs to wear that allow you to be shot with lasers by other players and your own laser gun to shoot them in return. Points are awarded for “zapping” them and deducted when you get zapped. Obviously, none of this involves actual pain – just the low cunning of creeping around a dark, possibly deserted maze, unsure if you’re about to get whacked by someone you thought was your best mate. Laser tag engages all your senses, like a Native American tracker, as you try to assess the danger The fun of Laser Quest lies partly in the fact that you’re acting like giant kids playing cowboys and Indians, but with really good equipment - instead of a load of twigs and a nerf gun between six of you, you’ve got vests that light up, space-age noises, swirling fog and ideally, enough imagination to believe that you’re Ripley’s favourite sidekick in Alien. There are flashing targets on your front, shoulders, back and on the sides and front of the gun. When you fire the gun, a laser beam is projected towards your target and when you are shot, your pack is deactivated for up to four seconds. A session lasts only 15 minutes and the rules insist there’s no running, climbing, crouching or crawling - so it’s not a game that burns a great number of calories. But it does engage all your senses, like a Native American tracker, as you try to assess where the next danger is coming from, and attempt to pick off your enemies. If there’s only two of you, staff will aim to integrate you with another group so it’s more fun. At the end, scores are displayed on monitors, and your individual hits are broken down. If you’ve always secretly fancied yourself as an action hero trapped on a demonic spaceship facing an unknown enemy (and who hasn’t?), it’s got to be worth a try.
