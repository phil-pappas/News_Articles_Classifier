As part of its commitment to offering guests the finest range of products and services, May next year will see the opening of a new IBEROSTAR hotel on the island. Currently under construction, the hotel will be situated on Portals Nous cove, just a short distance from Puerto Portals, and will have 63 rooms designed and furnished to five star hotel standards. This latest opening is a further step in strengthening the company’s commitment to the region. \nThe building design is the work of leading Dutch designer Marcel Wanders, who is internationally renowned for his architecture and interior design projects. The hotel will feature all the exclusive services and facilities that characterise The Grand Collection, IBEROSTAR Hotels & Resorts’ premium category. The IBEROSTAR Grand Hotel Portals Nous will also be an example of sustainability and energy efficiency with an innovative curtain wall system will allow efficient temperature control in the communal areas. In addition, guests will be able to enjoy a ‘biospa’, complete with a Turkish bath and sauna, and a sustainable luxury wellness centre designed in accordance with sustainable criteria. The new hotel will bring the chain’s number of The Grand Collection hotels around the world to ten, and will be the first on the island of Majorca. Aurelio Vázquez, GRUPO IBEROSTAR’s CEO for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, explained that “Here at GRUPO IBEROSTAR we are extremely satisfied with this new project that will enable us to offer the exclusivity of The Grand Collection product for the first time ever in Majorca, a key destination in the company’s commercial strategy”.
