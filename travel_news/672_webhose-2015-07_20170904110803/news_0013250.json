But where you're going could depend on where you live, according to data provided to CNBC by travel website Priceline.com .\nFolks in New England are jetting off to Europe, Southerners are visiting the Big Apple and seemingly everyone else is heading West.\nPriceline.com crunched the numbers on the top five flight destinations for each state for the vacation period June 22 through Sept. 21, booked through the site in April and May. Cases where the state's home airport was in a different state were excluded (people in Rhode Island aren't flying to Massachusetts, they just drive to up to Logan to fly somewhere else.)\n\"Looks like this summer is all about beaches and theme parks,\" said Brian Ek, a travel analyst at Priceline.com.\nThe big takeaway is that everyone wants to go to California. The Golden State is included in the top five for every other state in the nation as well as Washington, D.C. Its average ranking overall is 1.7, meaning it's likely to be ranked first in terms of travel destination (a full 27 times).\nCalifornians, meanwhile, don't want much to do with the rest of the country. Their three most common destinations for the summer are Europe, South America and Asia.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.\nEven as record heat sweeps the nation, people are still looking for fun in the sun, the data show. Florida and Texas are the second-most commonly listed destination states, with each listed by 42 other states . (Florida has a higher average rank of 2.1 versus 3.5 for Texas.)\nRead More East Coast heat wave blasts prices through the roof\nFlorida might have beaches, but the Lone Star state has its moment in the television spotlight . \"The 'Texas Rising' miniseries could have something to do with strong summer travel,\" Ek said. \"If that's the case, maybe other states should be looking closely at luring Hollywood to boost their tourism.\"\nDomestic or international? As any travel agent could tell you, domestic tourism means big bucks in the U.S., with nearly $791 billion spent in 2014, a 5.3 percent increase from 2013, according to the U.S. Travel Association . And summer travel is key to the domestic industry.\nFalling fuel prices have led a drop in travel costs across the nation. According to an index kept by the association, transportation costs are down 15 percent in the past year and airline fares are down 5 percent.\nIt's not just domestic keeping prices down: Summer travel can also be an indicator of America's international standing and interest in the rest of the world. Europe and Asia, as well as South America and the Caribbean, appear on states' top five list, largely from affluent states in New England and the West Coast.\nEurope's frequent appearance on the list is likely due to the strong dollar, Ek said, which is contributing to more Americans vacationing overseas. \"Could this be an indicator of improving customer sentiment and the improving health of the U.S. economy.\"\nAirlines: High-flyers or losing momentum?\nCNBC's Dominic Chu breaks down the numbers on three airline stocks.
