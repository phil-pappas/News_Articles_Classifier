Less legroom. Fewer frequent-flier miles. \nIs that all summer travelers can look forward to? \nThankfully, no. Amid the unpleasantness, there are a few bright spots where airlines inject a bit of humanity back into our journey. And with a record 222 million passengers expected to fly on U.S. airlines this summer, we could use any little bit of sympathy. \nHere are five things to actually like about flying today: \nBaggage guarantees: The $25 fee to check bags is a fact of life on most airlines. But until recently, only Alaska Airlines thought the extra money should guarantee passengers something in return. Since 2010, the airline has promised that suitcases will be on the carousel within 20 minutes of the plane arriving at the gate. If not, passengers get a $25 voucher for a future flight or 2,500 bonus frequent flier miles. Delta Air Lines copied that policy this year, offering 2,500 bonus miles to existing members of its frequent flier program — but no voucher. \nSuitcase delivery: You can skip the baggage carousel and have your bags delivered straight to your home, office, hotel or any other location within 40 miles of the airport. The service costs $30 for one bag, $40 for two or $50 for up to eight suitcases, and the bags are supposed to show up within four to six hours. Alaska, American, Delta, JetBlue, Southwest and United offer this service through an outside vendor, Bags VIP . \nStreaming video: The latest innovation in airline entertainment: the ability to stream movies and TV shows directly to our tablets and smartphones. Some content costs money, but there are plenty of free offerings. Alaska, American, Delta, JetBlue, Southwest and United all offer such a service on some of their planes. Your best bet to be entertained is on Delta, which offers the service on all but its 50-seat domestic regional jets and on more than half its international fleet, and on Southwest, which has it on 80% of its jets. \nFood and drinks on demand: Throughout Virgin America flights, passengers can order cookies, chicken sandwiches, margaritas and more on touch screens in front of them. The airline sells more items, and passengers don't have to wait long for a refill. \nCoat check: JetBlue now offers a coat check at New York's JFK. Yes, leave your jackets in chilly New York while you jet off to Florida or the Caribbean. The only catch: you need to fly back into JFK, it has to be a domestic flight and it costs $2 a day. Still, this service keeps the overhead bins less crowded and prevents passengers from forgetting jackets in their tropical hotel room. \n—Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T18:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T19:13:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
