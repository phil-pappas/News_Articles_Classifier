During the following months: July, August and September most tourists come from European countries.\nThe admission price is S/.10.00 (about US$3.17). Nonetheless, those who desire to go climbing must pay a fee of S/.60.00 (about US$19.04), so they can access the natural protected area snow-capped mountains.\nGamboa said ticket prices are “very generous” and therefore not as expensive, if compared to those offered in other countries. In this sense, he mentioned Argentina’s Aconcagua Natural Reserve, which fee totals an average €50.00.\nTickets to other natural protected areas will be sold by enterprise Teleticket, he added.\nLikewise, the Sernanp official said tourists will soon be able to download an app, which will serve as a “miniguide” to every natural protected area and will be called “Perú Natural”.\nToday, Huascaran National Park celebrates its 40th anniversary. Therefore, a book called “40 años del Parque Nacional Huascaran” (40 years of Huascaran National Park) will be presented at the Centro Cultural Huaraz located in Lima.\nRelated Posts Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building Visitor attractions to be discovered in Valais Village at Europa-Park on occasion of 20th anniversary Chelsea Football Club Hosts Leaders Sport Summit 2013, the world’s most Prestigious Sport Business Summit Norwegian announced three long-haul routes to America Utah lost $33 million in tourism due to shutdown", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T13:22:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
