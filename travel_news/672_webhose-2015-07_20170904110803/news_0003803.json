View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150716006662/en/ Prepaid SIM for JAPAN 7 days (Photo: Business Wire) The prepaid SIM vending machines, the first to be installed at Narita International Airport, will give foreign tourists and business travelers access to low-cost mobile data communications while in Japan. One machine each will be installed in the international arrival lobbies of Terminal 1 and Terminal 2. In addition to NTT Com's Prepaid SIM for JAPAN for short-term use, the machines will offer smartphones, mobile routers, accessories and more. Touch panel screens in English or Chinese guide the user through the purchase procedure. Payment is via credit card, so there is no need to prepare Japanese yen cash. After making their purchase, the user can register their name, birthday, etc. via either the machine's touch panel or passport scanner to begin accessing the Internet immediately. NTT Com already operates SIM card vending machines at the AQUA CITY ODAIBA mall in Tokyo and Kansai International Airport near Osaka. NTT Com's Prepaid SIM cards are also sold at airports, electronics stores and travel agencies. Given that a record 13 million tourists visited Japan in 2014 and more are expected this year, NTT Com expects to continue adding retail outlets for its Prepaid SIM, mainly at airports, electronics retail stores and travel agents. NTT Com also will gradually expand its range of optional services to support mobile communication experiences for foreign visitors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T06:02:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
