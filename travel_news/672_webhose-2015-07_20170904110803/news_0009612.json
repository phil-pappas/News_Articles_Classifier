It comes from Musco Lighting of Oskaloosa, Iowa. Musco systems also are in place at the Washington Monument, the White House and the Flight 93 National Memorial. \nThe lights cast a bright spotlight on the statue, clearly defining the folds of her robes. \nThe National Park Service said much of the previous lighting system was installed below ground and damaged in Superstorm Sandy. Musco had installed a temporary system. \nThe new system is expected to reduce energy consumption. New light-emitting diodes or LEDs illuminate the Statue of Liberty on Liberty Island after the new system was turned on in New York, Tuesday, July 7, 2015. The system comes from Musco Lighting of Oskaloosa, Iowa. Musco systems are also in place at the Washington Monument, the White House and the Flight 93 National Memorial.
