All true – but there are also pretty fishing villages, fascinating castles and picturesque walks among cork-oak trees. Add in the fact that Portugal is great value and it’s easy to see why it makes a superb destination for an extended winter break with Brittany Ferries. One village chosen by Brittany Ferries is Sagres, on the south-west tip of the Algarve. There’s a feeling of escapism here; the development along some parts of the coast has not reached this far and it’s a fine place for coastal hikes and birdwatching. Dominating the peninsula is a huge fortress with commanding views, while a trip to the clifftop lighthouse will give a real sense of being at one of the far corners of Europe. It’s also a great spot to watch the sunset Sagres, replete with rustic restaurants (try the local lobster), ends at the fishing port where traditional boats are still built. There are excellent beaches nearby: surfers favour the wild west coast, while the quieter south-shore strands are preferred by those catching those warm winter rays. If you fancy a change of scenery, the busy town of Lagos, which has lots of interesting shops, is a 20-minute drive away. Golf courses, including a few “hidden gems”, are about the same distance. An accommodation option offered by Brittany Ferries is the Sagres Time Apartments . Close to the town centre, these one- and two-bedroomed apartments are a tempting proposition for your four-week winter break, especially with prices from just £777pp including the Brittany Ferries crossing with your car from Portsmouth or Plymouth to Santander. Guests enthuse about the service from the apartments’ friendly staff and the fact that there is plenty of pet-friendly accommodation, meaning there’s no need to leave Fido behind during your extended break (he can even share your cabin on the ferry). Holidaymakers also appreciate the seawater pool, free parking and Wi-Fi, and the fact that shops and restaurants are just a short walk away. Rocha Brava Village Resort: near the sea this resort is three kilometres from Carvoeiro If you prefer to stay somewhere more central on the Algarve, but want to avoid the bustle of the busiest resorts, Carvoeiro is a good choice. This attractive town retains much old-world charm and the coastline is pocketed with sea caves, which can be viewed on a boat trip in calm weather. Carvoeiro has a decent selection of bars and restaurants, though there is greater choice a short drive away in the estuary town of Portimão, which also has an award-winning museum. A must-see while you are in this area is Silves, a lovely riverside town among citrus orchards which boasts a well-preserved Moorish castle, sitting proudly atop a hill. Climb the steps to the battlements and you’ll be rewarded with a wonderful panoramic view. Golfers will love the fact that they can be teeing off on the courses of the renowned Pestana golf complex just a few minutes after leaving Carvoeiro, and there are several more championship tracks nearby. Brittany Ferries’ selected accommodation in Carvoeiro is the Rocha Brava Village Resort . The complex has four pools (one covered and heated in winter) in its appealing grounds, tennis, a gym, 24-hour reception, free parking, Wi-Fi and an on-site supermarket and restaurant. Within strolling distance are the various cafes and eateries of the town. Costing from just £539pp for four weeks including your Brittany Ferries sailings to Santander or Bilbao, it’s an exceptional place to stay. Getting to the Algarve is very much part of the adventure, with the chance to overnight en route in a historic Spanish city such as Valladolid, Salamanca or Seville. Brittany Ferries has hotels in each of these beautiful cities, which can easily be booked as part of your package.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T23:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T19:55:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
