Manchester's Halle Orchestra's concert is designed to welcome a new audience to classical music. The event, to be held this September at Bridgewater Hall in Manchester, is called 'Priceless Classics'. • Manchester's Hallé: Knees-up for our oldest orchestra • An orchestra raised from the dead Chief executive John Summers told the BBC he wanted to host \"people who thought classical music was not for them or had never been to a concert hall and were kind of scared by the whole rigmarole.\" The concert will see 10 pieces performed, from 1700 to the present day, from 35 years apart, as an introduction to the genre. Mr Summers added: \"You can have a drink. You can go to the loo. The whole point it that people don't need to feel constrained by the normal concert etiquette.\" • Ziferblat, London's pay-as-you-go cafe • You decide how much meals are worth, restaurants tell customers Concert-goers must pre book free tickets, and then afterwards will be able to pay what they think it was worth. Tickets would normal start at £10, and go up to £40. The programme includes composers spanning 300 years, ranging from Bach, Handel and Mozart, to Bartók, Ligeti and Adams. This pricing model of 'pay what you want' was famously used by rock band Radiohead in 2007, who released their album In Rainbows and invited fans to pay what they wanted - including nothing at all. It was reported that most people paid a \"normal retail price\" for the album , despite having the option to pay nothing.
