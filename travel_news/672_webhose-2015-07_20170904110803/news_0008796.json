The Company’s weighted average diluted common shares and units of limited partnership interest in Hersha Hospitality Limited Partnership (“OP Units”) outstanding were approximately 50.9 million as of June 30, 2015, compared to approximately 51.8 million as of June 30, 2014. AFFO per diluted common share and OP Unit was $0.76 in second quarter 2015, compared to $0.67 per diluted common share and OP Unit reported in second quarter 2014. All data presented in this press release gives effect to the 1-for-4 reverse share split with regards to share counts and per share data. An explanation of certain non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release, including, among others, AFFO and Adjusted EBITDA, as well as reconciliations of those non-GAAP financial measures, is included at the end of this press release. \nMr. Jay H. Shah, Hersha’s Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Our portfolio, concentrated in coastal gateway markets delivered 7.9% RevPAR growth in the second quarter. Other than New York City, each of our major markets delivered double-digit RevPAR growth, driving a 15.7% increase in Hotel EBITDA to $54.0 million. Our portfolio in Manhattan outperformed the market by 50 basis points, marking our sixth straight quarter of outperforming Manhattan market trends. Operating fundamentals in Manhattan improved sequentially, with the portfolio delivering 2.4% RevPAR growth in June. This improvement, along with our results in July, provides confidence for a stronger back half of 2015.” \nMr. Shah continued, “In June, we acquired the high-quality, well-located St. Gregory Hotel in Washington, DC’s Dupont Circle for $57.0 million. The 155-room, independent hotel is immediately accretive to our portfolio’s RevPAR and EBITDA growth, and will benefit from our pricing and positioning strategies. The acquisition of the St. Gregory reflects our confidence in Washington, DC as evolving private and public sector demand drivers provide excellent prospects for meaningful RevPAR growth. We also continued to take advantage of the dislocation in our stock, and repurchased $37.6 million of our shares in the second quarter. To date in 2015, we have repurchased $50.2 million of common shares, representing approximately 4.0% of our float. While equity prices have rebounded from June 2015 lows, we stand ready to prudently utilize our repurchase program moving forward, especially in times of market volatility, or when our shares are undervalued.” \nSecond Quarter 2015 Operating Results \nDuring second quarter 2015, revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) at the Company's 47 consolidated hotels as of June 30, 2015, compared to 47 hotels as of June 30, 2014, increased 7.9% to $182.39. The Company’s average daily rate (“ADR”) for the consolidated hotel portfolio increased 6.5% to $207.76, while occupancy increased 116 basis points to 87.8%. Hotel EBITDA margins for the consolidated hotel portfolio increased 70 basis points to 42.6%, with Hotel EBITDA increasing 15.7%, or $7.3 million, to $54.0 million. \nDuring second quarter 2015, RevPAR at the Company's 45 comparable hotels as of June 30, 2015 increased 5.8% to $180.19. The Company’s ADR for the comparable hotel portfolio increased 5.2% to $205.86, while occupancy increased 48 basis points to 87.5%. Hotel EBITDA margins for the comparable hotel portfolio increased 50 basis points to 42.3%. \nThe Company’s best performing market during the second quarter was the West Coast, which reported 16.3% RevPAR growth. The Company’s Washington, DC, Boston and South Florida portfolios reported 14.6%, 11.7% and 10.2% RevPAR growth, respectively. \nNew York City and Manhattan \nThe New York City hotel portfolio, which includes the five boroughs, consisted of 17 hotels as of June 30, 2015. For second quarter 2015, the Company’s comparable New York City hotel portfolio (15 hotels) recorded a 1.4% decrease in RevPAR to $225.17, as ADR fell 60 basis points to $239.18 and occupancy decreased 76 basis points to 94.1%. \nThe Manhattan hotel portfolio consisted of 14 hotels as of June 30, 2015. For second quarter 2015, the Company’s comparable Manhattan hotel portfolio (12 hotels) achieved 94.6% occupancy, outperforming the wider market, but down 70 basis points versus second quarter 2014. RevPAR declined 1.7% to $240.15, while ADR decreased 1.0% to $253.85. \nOverall, Manhattan trailing 12 month occupancy has exceeded 85.0% for 37 consecutive months. The city’s preeminence as a financial, cultural, and technological hub, combined with increasing residual real estate and land value, provides the Company confidence from a long-term operational and investment perspective. \nFinancing \nAs of June 30, 2015, the Company maintained significant financial flexibility with approximately $28.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, and approximately $121.5 million of capacity from the Company’s $250 million revolving line of credit provided under the Company’s $500 million credit facility. As of June 30, 2015, 66.0% of the Company’s consolidated debt was fixed rate debt or effectively fixed through interest rate swaps and caps. The Company’s total consolidated debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4.08% and a weighted average life-to-maturity of approximately 3.7 years assuming no extension options are exercised. \nDuring second quarter 2015, the Company refinanced the outstanding mortgage debt at Hyatt Union Square within a favorable financing environment. The new $55.8 million loan, priced at 30-day LIBOR plus 230 basis points and maturing in June 2019, will result in annual cost savings of approximately $1.0 million. \nAcquisitions \nIn June, the Company purchased the 155-room St. Gregory Hotel & Suites in Washington, DC for $57.0 million. Based on the Company’s underwriting assumptions, the purchase price reflects a forward economic capitalization rate and EBITDA multiple of 7.0% and 12.9x, respectively. The acquisition of the St. Gregory was funded with cash on hand and with proceeds from the Company’s $250 million revolving line of credit under its $500 million senior unsecured credit facility. The acquisition also included the assumption of $25.8 million in mortgage debt that matures in September 2021. \nThe St. Gregory, which joined Hersha’s growing portfolio of independent hotels, is situated in Washington, DC’s DuPont Circle neighborhood at 21st and M Street NW, proximate to Downtown and the West End. \n1-for-4 Reverse Share Split \nOn June 1, 2015, the Company announced a reverse share split of its issued and outstanding common shares and common units of limited partnership interest and LTIP units at a ratio of 1-for-4. The reverse share split took effect after the market close on June 22, 2015. \nAccordingly, every four issued and outstanding common shares were combined into one common share. Since the reverse stock split took effect, and as of July 27, 2015, the Company’s average daily trading volume has increased approximately 43.0%, while price performance has increased 1.0% compared to a 3.0% decline in the SNL US Hotel REIT Index. \nShare Repurchase Activity \nDuring the second quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 1.5 million outstanding common shares for $37.6 million at a weighted average price of $25.60 per share. To date in 2015, the Company has repurchased approximately 2.0 million common shares for an aggregate repurchase price of $50.2 million, representing approximately 4.0% of common shares outstanding. The Company will continue to consider further repurchases during periods of share price volatility. \nDividends \nHersha paid a dividend of $0.50 per Series B Preferred Share and $0.4297 per Series C Preferred Share for the second quarter 2015. The preferred share dividends were paid July 15, 2015 to holders of record as of July 1, 2015. \nThe Company’s second quarter dividend, paid on July 15, 2015 to the holders of record of common shares on the close of business on June 30, 2015, was adjusted to $0.28 per common share (reflecting four times the previously announced second quarter dividend of $0.07 per common share to reflect the reverse share split). \nNet Income/Loss \nNet income applicable to common shareholders was $15.6 million, or $0.32 per diluted common share, in the second quarter 2015 compared to net income applicable to common shareholders of $53.3 million, or $1.06 per diluted common share, in second quarter 2014. \n2015 Outlook \nThe Company is updating operating and financial expectations for 2015 for the Company’s consolidated and comparable portfolios.
