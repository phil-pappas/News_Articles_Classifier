He lives in Jindabyne, NSW, and spends the Australian winter at Perisher before heading to the Rocky Mountain resort of Breckenridge, Colorado, to train in the lead-up to Christmas.\nIf friends were visiting you in Colorado, what would you insist they do?\nRH: We’d go for a ski at Breckenridge, which is where I spend most of my time on the slopes in Colorado. It’s a fun resort with really good terrain parks. Then we’d hit Empire Burger, a typical American sports bar on Main St for a well-earned burger. Down the hill into Denver, we’d watch an NFL game. I still don’t completely get how it’s played but the atmosphere is great and it’s good for a little off-mountain fun.\nYour top three destinations to take a ski holiday?\nRH: First I’d say Perisher and not just because it’s my home mountain. It has a world-class terrain park along with four other terrain parks, which will help anybody progress into the bigger park on Front Valley.\nThe resort has a lot of terrain, so on a powder day you’ll never be disappointed as there’s always somewhere new to explore.\nThe mountains, food and culture of the European Alps is one of the best ski experiences you can have and, of course Colorado. You can get an Epic Pass, which gives you unlimited access to several resorts on the same lift ticket, including Vail.\n Australian freestyle skier Russ Henshaw in action. Picture: Christian Pondella/Red Bull Escape Source: Supplied\nBest place you’ve ever stayed?\nRH: Hotel Arlberghaus in Zurs, Austria. It’s part of the St Anton ski resort and I was fortunate enough to stay there during a photo shoot. It’s a family-run hotel with great food and, to top it off, ski-in, ski-out.\nWhat’s been the most memorable part of your travels?\nRH: Going to the Olympics. I grew up ski-racing and always wanted to go to the Olympics but when I started freeskiing, I had to kiss that dream goodbye as slopestyle wasn’t on the menu.\nAs soon as the announcement came that it would be included in the 2014 Sochi Olympics, I worked my butt off to qualify for the team and to get myself to Russia.\nI had a few hiccups along the way with my knee injuries but despite all that, it’s something I’ll always be proud of and will never forget.\nWhat ski destinations are on your wish list?\nRH: I’d love to go back to Japan and ski some powder. I’ve only been once and it was spring when I went, so there wasn’t much powder about.\nHas anything gone wrong while you’ve been travelling?\nRH: It’s pretty rare for things to go smoothly, to be honest (laughs). I’ve missed flights, had flights cancelled, lost bags, been injured and been lost on a mountain. The trick to travel is patience. You have to be able to laugh at the situation.", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/769451-2a093fc6-290c-11e5-b088-701fc9b6d408.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-19T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T11:47:45.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
