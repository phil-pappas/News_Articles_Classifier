Travelers look to Gray Line, the global leader in sightseeing, as a name they know and trust. The familiar blue and white diamond logo is a symbol of reliability, shared by over 150 members in major cities throughout the world, each independently owned and operated.\nIn 1981, Brush Hill obtained a sightseeing license in Boston, which opened the door for new opportunities in the revived tourism and convention marketplace. In the early ‘90s, the Gray Line Sightseeing Franchise or “diamond” was awarded to Brush Hill. A full schedule of one-day Boston and New England tours continues to be offered as well as the Beantown Trolley shuttle, a San Francisco-style trackless trolley car, with a fully narrated 105-minute tour of Boston and point-to-point shuttle service along the tour route.\nAs the local expert in transportation, one of Brush Hill's specialties is in providing shuttle services. The company coordinates pick-ups for all size groups and shuttles passengers to and from their destination point. Brush Hill’s charter services are used frequently for corporate, academic or special events, including weddings, proms or reunions, for organizations as varied as the Boston Red Sox, John Hancock, and many area high schools and colleges (for both academic and athletic purposes).

The company also runs a number of routes to Foxwoods, and operates the Boston-based Red Beantown Trolley. Brush Hill Transportation Company is owned by the Anzuoni family, who also own Plymouth & Brockton Street Railway Company.\nThe Anzuoni family has been at the forefront of the transportation business since 1920 when George A.

Anzuoni, Sr. delegated his son Larry to take control of the commuter line.
