Thorpe joined the Victoria Warehouse team as operations manager in March this year and following his promotion he will now oversee the operations of both the Hotel and Victoria Warehouse event spaces. \nPrior to joining Victoria Warehouse, Thorpe was conference and events manager at Manchester United Football Club. He brings with him extensive catering and event knowledge developed throughout his ten years in the industry, having worked within hotels, sport, outside catering and events with brands such as P&O Cruises. Thorpe says: “I am excited to begin my new role as general manager at Victoria Warehouse, following a successful three months as operations manager. The venue has an exciting future ahead of it with the scale of events and the expansion of the site as it breaks into the corporate market.” Thorpe’s promotion marks the beginning of Victoria Warehouse’s investment into its corporate events team, which has also seen the recruitment of Manos Chatzakis, as bars manager. Chatzakis will be responsible for ensuring the smooth running of all the beverage operations within the venue and hotel, as well as managing, training and developing a team with the key aim of delivering excellent customer service and building sales and profitability. The venue is also looking to expand its sales team with the imminent recruitment of another sales manager and sales co-ordinator. The new recruits will join Faye Millar, Jen Panton and Kayleigh Brindle. James Cohen, owner of Victoria Warehouse says: “The expansion of our team is representative of our recent successes. We are continuing to push the boundaries of what Victoria Warehouse can achieve and we are looking forward to what the future holds.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T16:02:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
