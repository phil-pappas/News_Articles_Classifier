In partnership with Destination NSW and Bauer Xcel Media, Inland NSW has delivered the first stage of this game changing online asset for regional tourism,” Mr Perry said.\n“Think ‘Gourmet Traveller’ meets ‘online travel agent’. Travel In brings together publishing level content with a booking functionality to provide the complete package – information and inspiration coupled with the ability to book. It’s driving economic benefit and providing visitors with a better experience, meaning everyone wins.”\nDevelopment of ‘Travel In’ was supported by NSW Government funding through Destination NSW, with a grant of $832,000 over two years under the Regional Visitor Economy Fund (RVEF).\nTags: digital platform , NSW , Travel in", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T14:59:13.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
