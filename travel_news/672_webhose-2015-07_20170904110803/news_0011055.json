The plane was deemed serviceable and left the treeless, tundra-covered island to fly the 276 passengers and 18 crewmembers to Anchorage, 2414 kilometres away. \nA plane flew in from Hong Kong to pick up the passengers in Anchorage and fly them to Los Angeles International Airport. \nCathay Pacific Airways said that flight arrived in Los Angeles shortly before 4:30 am on Thursday (local time). \n\"Once again, we apologize to passengers for the delay, but everybody is safe and sound, and that's what's the most important,\" Cathay Pacific spokeswoman Jennifer Pearson said. \"They're now at their destination.\" \nThe company said it will investigate the cause of the smoke. \nThe National Transportation Safety Board was notified of the incident but is not investigating it at this time, according to NTSB investigator Shawn Williams. \nAir Force officials said the passengers stayed on the plane and watched movies during the time they spent on Shemya Island, which is located in a sparsely populated area at the western tip of the Aleutians chain. \nAbout 120 civilian contractors staff an early warning radar system at Shemya for the military. The island base has a 10,000-foot runway, which was developed in the 1940s for reconnaissance and bombing missions, according to officials. Ad Feedback \nSuch emergency landings by large commercial carriers are unusual for the island, but they are not unheard of. \nIn July 2010, an American Airlines jet traveling from Dallas-Fort Worth to Tokyo made an emergency landing at Shemya after a fire warning light malfunctioned. - AP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T02:34:21.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
