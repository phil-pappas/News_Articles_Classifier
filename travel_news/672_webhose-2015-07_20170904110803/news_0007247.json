With 20pc of those between 55 and 75 planning to cash in their pensions, and 35pc of those planning to spend that money on travelling 1 , it’s clear that the dreams of having an exciting retirement while you’re still active enough to travel have not died. However, for financial reasons, many people are working long past state pension age, with official Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures showing a 75pc surge in the numbers of people working in their 50s and 60s since the early Nineties 2 . If you want to buck that trend, it’s clear that financial planning is the key to a successful long and early retirement. Here are some of the most important steps. 1. Don’t delay on pension contributions Paying into a pension as early as you can is the key to building up a savings pot that will allow you to retire early. In general, the earlier you start, the less it will cost you to build up a sizeable pension that will allow you to retire. This is because your money will have more time to grow. The cash that you get back from the taxman when you save into your pension will allow it to grow even more quickly, so it makes sense to take advantage of this tax relief as early as you can. If you have a company pension, your employer may also make contributions to your pension if you make them yourself, so by not doing so, you are effectively turning down a pay rise. Check whether your employer will make extra contributions if you increase your own pension savings, and consider increasing your own contributions if they do. 2. Know your numbers Saving into a pension for early retirement is all very well, but you need to know when you will be able to access the money. At present, retirees can access their private pension savings at the age of 55 – more than 10 years before most people receive their state pensions. However, this age will rise to 57 by 2028 and then is expected to rise again after that in line with the state pension age. This means that if you are aged between 36 and 44 now, you will get your money when you are 58. For those aged from 23 to 35, pensions will be available at 59. For anyone younger, it will be at least 60. If this is not early enough for your plans, you will need to make financial provision to bridge the gap between stopping working and starting your retirement, perhaps by using other tax-efficient savings such as Isas. 3. Check in regularly Making regular checks on the performance of your assets will help to keep you on track for the retirement you want. You can get a forecast on employer pension schemes by writing to the trustees to find out how your pension is doing. If you have a private pension, check the performance of the investments behind it. If you are not happy with their performance, you might wish to consider the level of risk you are taking, the diversity of the portfolio in which you have invested and the performance of individual funds or shares. If you aren’t confident doing this yourself, an independent financial adviser should be able to help. 4. Make the most of what you’ve got The new pensions freedoms, which came in on April 6, allow you unprecedented choice over how you use your pension wealth. You no longer have to buy an annuity – giving a lifetime income – with your pension pot. Instead you can take it as cash or leave it invested, drawing down money as you need it. In any case, the first 25 per cent of your pension cash can be taken tax free. Different ways of using your pension pot will give you differing amounts of income, although you will also be taking differing amounts of risk. The Government offers free guidance to those wishing to make the most of their pension pots. Its free Pension Wise service, www.pensionwise.gov.uk , is now being extended to anyone over 50, following the Summer Budget, so that prospective early retirees can make plans in advance. Again, specialist financial advice may help you to make even more of your money, particularly if your circumstances are complex. 5. Consider portfolio retirement Early retirement does not have to be total. Government statistics show a rise in self-employed older people, suggesting that many give up full-time employment and exchange it for part-time consultancy work. Figures from Saga’s report into elderly people’s employment, Generation W, suggest that people older than 65 tend to be in part-time employment rather than full-time employment, while 61pc of employed people aged between 65 and 69 are in part-time employment. 3 Research from the European Union suggests that many older people would like a phase of “pre-retirement” during which they work part-time 4 . In addition to this, Ros Altmann, former pensioners’ champion and now Pensions Minister, has suggested the possibility of “Gap Breaks”, where older workers could take an extended period of time off before returning to the workplace. “Such a scheme could help retain the skills and experience of older employees,” she says, “while allowing them to ‘recharge their batteries’.” For those who fear they cannot afford to retire fully as early as they would like, these may be ways to gain more time in later life. In short, planning is the key to retiring early, but it is important to be realistic, too. If you stop work at 55, your retirement is likely to last a long time, so you need to ensure that you will be financially comfortable, even if inflation rises. As well as considering the financial implications of retiring early, you need to think about the other pluses from being in the workplace, including companionship, job satisfaction and sense of purpose. Weighing up the pros and cons of being retired for a long time is vital before you take the plunge. Risk information Laws and tax rules may change in the future without notice.
