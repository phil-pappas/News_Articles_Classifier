I paused for a few moments, took in a few gulps of clean Navarre air, and then turned on my heels and retraced my steps up the gradient – back into the little Plaza Consistorial, and left into Calle de Mercaderes. Then I picked the second turn on the right, and glimpsed the lengthy drag of Calle de la Estafeta, its cobbles damp and slippery in the autumn gloom. Here, I could see, was the bulk of the 851-metre journey I was attempting – a long, self-contained strip with no obvious options for exit. It must have taken me four minutes to reach its end at walking pace – and by the time I had done so, I was wondering why anyone would try to follow the same route with a 1400-pound bull careening along behind them in a furious frenzy. They do, though – and hundreds of young men (it is almost always young men) will go where many others have sprinted and fallen over the course of this week, as the Festival of San Fermin (July 6-14) holds sway in what is one of northern Spain’s most intriguing cities. You may already have seen footage of them doing so today, putting their limbs and lives at risk to take part in the encierro – the notorious “running of the bulls”, which takes place every morning at 8am across the eight main days of the fiesta (July 6 is a pre-cursor to the event). Some would die for the “privilege”. Since 1925, 15 people have been killed in the process, gored or trampled under the hooves of these heavy bovines – the most recent fatality in 2009. Up to 300 people are injured every year. It is a brutal proposition. The encierro has been condemned by bodies like the league Against Cruel Sports (Photo: Getty) And no more so than for the bull. Six of them make this harried excursion to the bull-ring each day. All six of them are slaughtered on the tip of a matador’s sword at some moment in the ensuing hours. Blood pours onto the sand, the audience roars, the party continues. There can be no doubt that Pamplona’s main annual extravaganza is one of the most controversial events to take place on European soil. And there are plenty of voices which declare it to be a disgrace. The League Against Cruel Sports is unequivocal in its condemnation. Of the encierro , it states that “each morning, bulls are forced to run a kilometre down the streets of the town, chased by cheering participants and spectators. Once released, the bulls are frightened with gun shots, electrocuted with cattle prods and kicked and hit by jeering spectators, often down concrete or cobbled streets which they slip and slide on, suffering broken legs and other injuries in the process.” The protest group is currently placing pressure on the tour operator Topdeck, which specialises in breaks for travellers aged 18-30, and offers tours to Pamplona which coincide with San Fermin. The company, the League says, is profiting from violence by selling holidays which place tourists at the scene of the action without specifically outlining the destruction involved. “Travel companies have a responsibility to the welfare of animals in tourism, but Topdeck is a persistent offender,” says the League’s Campaigns Director Tom Quinn. “Cynically removing tell-tale words from its website may have helped it avoid censure, but Topdeck continues to ride roughshod over the spirit of ABTA’s guidelines.” A serious point, firmly made. And yet, there is a clearly a disconnection between those who consider bull-fighting an abomination, and the estimated one million carousers who throng the lanes of Pamplona for nine days each July – and thoroughly enjoy the process. For all the brutality, Pamplona can be a thrilling city to experience (Photo: Getty) Pamplona, with its history and folklore, is a seductive city – and I speak as someone who has spent several days there, and found it intoxicating. Perhaps you can blame Ernest Hemingway, that most boorish and yet brilliant of American authors, who first visited the capital of Navarre for San Fermin in 1923, and painted it as a decadent riot of late nights, long lunches, after-dark bed-hopping and Roaring Twenties glamour in his greatest novel, 1926’s The Sun Also Rises – but it is difficult not to be caught up in the febrile ambience. Even on the autumn weekend when I was last there – three months after San Fermin had finished – it still felt, to an extent, like the festival was in swing. There were Friday-night revellers spilling out of Bar Txoko – where Hemingway loved to drink while staying in the city – onto the busy flagstones of Plaza del Castillo. The coffee at Café Iruna – a Pamplona institution on the far side of the square, where the hung-over characters in The Sun Also Rises regroup for breakfast – is excellent, and ordering a cappuccino here effectively allows you to sit within Hemingway’s prose. Bar Gaucho is another landmark, serving mouth-watering pintxos at bargain prices amid walls covered in bull-fighting posters and matador memorabilia. The bull-ring itself, the city’s soul, is an architectural joy – the third biggest stadium of its kind on the planet (behind Mexico City and Madrid). Pamplona's enormous bullring is the third biggest in the world (Photo: Getty) Did being so absorbed by this merry swirl make me an apologist for bloodsports? I didn’t, and don’t, think so. And I confess that I haven’t been in Pamplona for San Fermin, nor seen a bull cut down in its arena. But I must also confess that I have watched a corrida de toros . A few months after being in Pamplona, I found myself in Seville while a festival was taking place at its vast bull-fighting temple La Maestranza. Perhaps it was the bellow of the crowd which pulled me in, perhaps morbid curiosity, perhaps a stubborn belief that I should witness what is often defended as a Spanish tradition with my own eyes before being able to deride it. Whatever the reason, tickets were available, and I took my place under a blazing sun to gaze at a horror show. The perceived romance and ritual of the corrida – the costumes, the carnival atmosphere – vanished almost immediately, replaced by the desperate reality. What seems – in those colourful images in establishments like Bar Gaucho – to be ballet; athletic combat between man and beast; a meeting of warriors – is more like a back-street brawl where a lone victim is severely out-numbered (seven to one), and softened up by henchmen (including picadores – men on horseback, armed with lances), before the gang-leader strides in to deliver the coup de grace . It is an awful spectacle, the bull staggering around the ring, its life squirting from its wounds. I left at the end of the fourth fight (there are six in a session), unable to stomach any more, illusions shattered. Do I regret paying to watch this series of assassinations? No – I wanted to be able to comment from a position of knowledge. Would I do so again? No, never. But the problem for opponents of bloodsports is that, while there has been a growing rejection of bull-fighting in Spain (notably in Catalonia, which banned it in 2010; Barcelona’s enormous arena La Monumental is now largely disused), in corrida hotspots like Pamplona and Seville, it is still practically a religion, where mass is unlikely to be cancelled. Maybe there is a middle-ground somewhere – maybe the French version of the activity, Course Landaise , in which there is no bloodshed. But as Pamplona surges through another week of mayhem, few of those dashing down Calle de la Estafeta will question the morality, wisdom or correctness of what they are doing. Perhaps they will once they have stared open-mouthed as another noble creature collapses, its back reinvented as a pin-cushion. But until then, they will shout loudly and happily. And I can understand their fascination. Follow @telegraphtravel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T00:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T19:18:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
