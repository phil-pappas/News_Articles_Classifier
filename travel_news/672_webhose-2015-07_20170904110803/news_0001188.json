Picture: REUTERS/BOBBY YIP TOKYO — Asian shares and the euro were tentatively higher on Tuesday on hopes that Greece’s conditional bail-out agreement would bring to an end that country’s debt crisis, though caution kept broad gains in check.\nMeanwhile, oil prices skidded as the market awaited an announcement on a nuclear deal between Iran and six global powers that could lead to an easing of sanctions against Tehran and a resumption of its oil exports into an oversupplied market.\nMSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up about 0.1%, off earlier highs as Chinese shares slumped.\nShanghai’s benchmark composite index was down 0.6 percent, while the CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen slipped 0.9%\nChina stocks had risen for the past three sessions, which raised investors’ hopes that Beijing’s recent stabilisation steps had worked to stem a massive correction.\nJapan’s Nikkei stock index added 1.6%.\nLater on Tuesday, Greece’s Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will face a showdown with members of his own party over the bail-out agreement, under which Greece can get a possible 86 billion euros ($95bn) over three years if it can satisfy its European partners that it is meeting their conditions.\nThe terms imposed by Athens’ international lenders led by Germany obliged Tsipras to abandon his pledge to end austerity.\nUS stock futures were slightly lower, with S&P 500 mini futures down a few ticks from late US levels, after Wall Street jumped on hopes for the Greece deal. All three major stock indexes ended up more than 1%, in what some strategists described as a relief rally.\nBut some said doubts would remain until the proposal is actually accepted.\n\"Investors did not like that a Grexit is still on the table if Parliament votes no,\" managing director at BK Asset Management, said in a note to clients. \"The risk is far less now than a week ago but the fact that it is not eliminated puts pressure on the euro.\"\nThe euro last traded at $1.1010, up about 0.1 percent on the day.
