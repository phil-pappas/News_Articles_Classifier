The new lane is part of a Nexus expansion plan outlined in the joint Beyond the Border Action Plan in 2011 between the two governments. Applicants pay $50 and go through an interview to receive the Nexus card, which expedites border crossings at many land and marine ports, as well as participating airports with Global Entry kiosks. Currently over 1.2 million travelers have enrolled in Nexus. Aimed at Canada-bound rush-hour traffic, the Stanstead lane will be dedicated to Nexus between 3 and 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, and open to regular crossings at other times.\nIn Transit Travel news, deals and tips, written by the editors and reporters of the Travel section.
