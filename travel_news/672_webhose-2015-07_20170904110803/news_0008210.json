During this time Tricia looked after the outbound MICE Market and Wholesale partners. In 2010 Tricia moved to Australia taking on the role of Director of Sales & Marketing at Sheraton Noosa Resort & Spa, successfully repositioning the hotel after a AUD$10 million renovation.\nAs Director of SSO Brisbane, Tricia will be based at Four Points by Sheraton Brisbane, reporting into Ashley Hansen, Regional Director for Sales & Marketing and Starwood Sales Organisation in the Pacific.\n“As Starwood’s footprint grows across Australia, we are expanding our sales organisation to match where our customer base is growing. By appointing a dedicated and experienced seller for Queensland and Western Australia, we are increasing the ease of doing business with Starwood,” Ashley said.\nHe continues, “Tricia is a welcome addition to our growing sales team and I am confident her wealth of experience working with high net worth clients will be a strong advantage as we continue to optimise our sales strategy.”\nSource:- Starwood Hotels & Resort\nRelated Posts Starwood Hotels & Resorts Strikes a Chord with Amped Up Music Experiences Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium Starwood Hotels & Resorts Designs a New Look for Tech-Savvy Travelers with the SPG App for Google Glass Westin Hotels & Resorts Set to Debut in Buffalo, New York, as Part of Downtown Revitalization Lisa Lewis Joins Associated Luxury Hotels As National Sales Manager In The U.S. West Region", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T10:51:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
