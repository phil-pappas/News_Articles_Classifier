It is the Magaluf effect. \n“Lots of people come from Britiain and what they need is a quality resort. We don’t want to attract 20 million tourists each year and then they do not have a good time. We may need limits.” \nThe comments were backed by head of tourism in Las Palmas in Gran Canaria Pedro Quevedo, who added: “We should limit the growth of the industry, ban building on some areas and protect the environment.” \nFernando Fraile, president of the tourism authority in Tenerife, said: “it is time to think of the quality of tourism we are offering.” \nThe paper added of the 11 million tourists that visited the Canaries in 2014, four million were British, making the UK the largest single market.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T13:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T12:32:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
