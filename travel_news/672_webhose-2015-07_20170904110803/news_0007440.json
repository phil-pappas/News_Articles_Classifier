Fast forward to today - more than 57 million people with disabilities have access to tools to be full participants in all aspects of society. \" Easter Seals urges Americans to reflect on the progress made possible by the ADA, but to be mindful of the work that still needs to be done for the new generation of individuals living with disabilities,\" says Katy Neas , Easter Seals' Executive Vice President, Public Affairs. Celebrating Disability History To celebrate the 25 th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Easter Seals is hosting a Twitter chat to talk about the ADA's impact and what still needs to be done in the disability space. Use #ADAToday on Thursday, July 23 at 1 p.m. CDT ( 2 p.m. EST ) to join. Easter Seals will also have a presence at the Smithsonian ADA Festival in Washington, D.C. July 24-27 . Thrive , Easter Seals' mentorship program for young women with disabilities, is celebrating the ADA by revisiting Easter Seals' historic PSA campaign. Individuals of all abilities are encouraged to share their ideas for a new poster that captures the importance of the monumental law. Submissions can be graphic designs, paintings, drawings, videos, audio recordings, or written descriptions. Follow the creativity using #ADA25Thrive on Twitter. What's Next Beyond the celebration activities for the ADA, it's a perfect point in time to draw attention to the work that still needs to be done in terms of employment, housing and transportation. \"Too many adults with disabilities are unemployed or under-employed. Too many people struggle to find affordable accessible housing, too many people cannot access independent living supports outside of a nursing home and air travel remains out of reach to people. We need to continue moving the bar to afford people living with disabilities the liberties they deserve,\" adds Neas. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T19:35:26.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
