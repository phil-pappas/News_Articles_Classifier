I definitely enjoyed that,” Johnson said. “We stuck to our plans and bowled really well ... I think we’ve almost played the perfect Test match to be honest.”\nAfter being humiliated in the first Test at Cardiff, Australia overcame multiple personnel dramas and the flattest of wickets to take a stranglehold on momentum heading into the next instalment at Edgbaston which kicks off on July 29.\nAustralian captain Michael Clarke threw the gauntlet down to England by declaring for the second time in the Test in the shadows of lunch on day four.\nFaced with a mountainous target of 509 to win, Alastair Cook’s side collapsed in spectacular fashion to be all out for just 103 with Johnson back to his fearsome best.\nThe 405-run victory margin was the biggest by runs in an Ashes match since 1948, and the fourth biggest of all time.\nNeeding to last a minimum of 155 overs to save the Test match, England made it to the end of just 37.\nEngland were cheering the return of the old Mitchell Johnson in Cardiff as he was smacked all over the park, but the left-arm destroyer showed you should never knock a champion as he fired back with a devastating three-wicket blast either side of tea that had the hosts on their knees, at one point reduced to 7-64.\nThis was a wicket that was supposed to be a batsman’s paradise, but Australia’s high-voltage pace attack proved that relentless hostile bowling can rattle England’s jumpy top order on even the bleakest surface.\nAfter losing the first Test inside four days, Australia couldn’t have hit back any more emphatically, and they did so despite missing wicket-keeper Brad Haddin (personal reasons), Shane Watson (dropped) and losing Chris Rogers to an alarming dizzy spell.\nJosh Hazlewood and Nathan Lyon took two wickets each, Mitchell Starc and Mitchell Marsh one apiece and Johnson with a brilliant instinctive run-out to get rid of danger man Ben Stokes on the stroke of tea.\nSteve Smith (215) and Rogers (173) set the match up with a record partnership in the first innings.\n— with News Corp’s Ben Horne.\n1am — ENGLAND CONTINUES TO FALTER\nEngland's Ben Stokes leaves the pitch after being run out on the fourth day of the second Ashes Test. Source: AP\nMITCHELL Johnson struck twice in the first over after the tea break to reduce England to 7/64.\nAustralia looks all but certain of wrapping up the game today after Jos Buttler (11) and Moeen Ali (0) joined Ian Bell (11) and Ben Stokes (0) back in the pavilion.\nButtler became the fourth batsmen to be caught behind by Peter Nevill in the innings before Ali was caught by Shaun Marsh fending off a short ball. Earlier, Bell was caught at short leg by Shaun Marsh off the bowling of Nathan Lyon and Ben Stokes was run out by Mitchell Johnson for a duck.\n11.40pm — THIRD MITCH JOINS THE PARTY\nMitch Marsh is having quite the game with the ball.

England is 3/42.\n11.05pm — JOHNSON SUCKS IN COOK\nMitchell Johnson is proving you don’t need a helpful pitch to take wickets.

England is 2/30.\n10.45pm — STARC STRIKES FIRST\nMitchell Starc claimed Adam Lyth’s wicket for the second time in this match. Source: AFP\nMITCHELL Starc produced a spitting delivery which bounced on Adam Lyth to remove the English opener for seven in the second over after the lunch break.\nLyth fended at the ball and sent a nick through to Aussie keeper Peter Nevill for the second time in the match. Lyth’s fourth consecutive failure of the series — he has scores of 6, 37, 0 and 7 — will increase the pressure on him to hold his spot for the third Test.\nHe was listed as one of three English top order batsmen playing for their spots in this innings by former Test cricketer Bob Willis. “Adam Lyth, Gary Ballance and Ian Bell have had a torrid time this summer and England just can’t afford to have three-quarters of their top order misfiring,” Willis wrote for The Mirror .\n“Big match-winning or saving scores are hard enough to come by without having three men back in the pavilion before you have got 50 on the board ... Lyth has been found out and is heading the same way as Sam Robson, Nick Compton, Michael Carberry and the same as Jonathan Trott’s ill-fated attempt at opening in the West Indies.”\n10pm — AUSTRALIA DECLARE 508 RUNS AHEAD\nDavid Warner led the way in the second innings. Source: AP\nMICHAEL Clarke has given his bowlers a little more than five sessions to win the second Test after declaring just before lunch on day four.\nAustralia scored 146 runs from just 23 overs this morning to finish 2/254 and set England a chase of 509 runs.\nAfter losing opening partner Chris Rogers to a concerning delayed reaction to concussion, David Warner set the tone with a blistering knock of 83.\nSteve Smith (58 from 48), Michael Clarke (32 not out from 34) and Mitch Marsh (27 not out from 19) added further punishment to an English bowling lineup which was only able to collect 10 wickets across the two Australian innings.\nEngland openers Adam Lyth and Alastair Cook negotiated three overs to reach lunch at 0/7.\n8.20pm — ROGERS FORCED TO RETIRE HURT\nBrad Haddin and David Warner tend to Chris Rogers. Source: AP\nIN concerning scenes, Chris Rogers has been forced to retire hurt early on day four of the second Test.\nThe Australian opening batsman was hit in the side of the head by James Anderson with the first ball of day two and appears to still be suffering from the blow.\nRogers shocked viewers by kneeling down in the middle of the pitch at the end of the second over today as he appeared to be suffering from dizziness. Team physio Alex Kountouris and doctor Peter Brukner rushed out to the middle and immediately made the decision to help the unwell star off the field, where he was replaced at the crease by Steve Smith.\nAnderson’s short ball on day two caught Rogers by surprise and left him stunned, however the decision was made by medical staff to let him bat on.\nHe went on to make 173 in the first innings and then took his place in the field for all of day three. The delayed nature of the reaction was bizarre and concerning.\nRogers was forced out of Australia’s two Test series in the West Indies recently after being hit in the head during a net session.\nLast summer Rogers was smashed in the helmet fielding at short leg. In the wake of the Hughes tragedy, the incident left him badly shaken up and he was determined to never have to field in the danger position again.\n— with Ben Horne\nRogers receives medical treatment after being hit in the head on day two.

Source: Getty Images\nFORMER English wicketkeeper Matt Prior has slammed the condition of the Lord’s pitch — saying it has left the home side at a disadvantage.\nEngland has taken just eight wickets in the match as Australia enters day four at 0/108 in its second innings with a lead of 362 runs. David Warner (60) and Chris Rogers (44) are the not out batsmen.\nWriting for The Independent , Prior said the English quicks would be furious with the state of the wicket. “If anyone thinks that Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson are sat in that dressing room pleased with the pitches we’ve seen this summer then they’re off their heads. Their hearts would have sank on that first morning, firstly when they saw the surface and secondly when they found out they were going to have to bowl first on it,” Prior wrote.\n“The pitches in this country have to improve and I don’t for one minute believe that England have asked for these kind of wickets. You have to give credit to Broad because he bowled really, really well in that Australian first innings but as Jimmy and Mark Wood found bowling on this surface on the opening day, when potentially there should be a bit of lateral movement and a bit of pace, it was a pretty thankless task.\n“For me, it’s one of the great things about playing in Australia. Yes, we lost the 2013-14 series on quick wickets but there was always something going on, always something in it for the bowlers and plenty in it for the batsmen too. We saw that at the World Cup Down Under too, the Australians have got their preparation pitch-perfect. You can’t say the same for us.”\nBroad noted the change in the pitch from England’s last match at Lord’s in his column for the Daily Mail . “This Lord’s pitch does not have the pace it had when we played New Zealand earlier in the summer and it’s been hard work for a bowler like me who likes to hit the deck hard,” Broad wrote. “Our attack contains bowlers who nibble the ball around off the pitch and there’s been absolutely no sideways movement on this pitch. It’s hard work for fast bowlers.”\nLegendary Australian quick Glenn McGrath said “the English team should take this pitch as an insult”. “We do not know whether the groundsman was working on orders from the home team’s management or whether it is just bad luck, but whatever the reason England should have learned a lesson from this Test,” McGrath wrote for The Telegraph . “For the rest of the series they should be asking for pitches that offer some assistance to the bowlers. If they ask for more slow surfaces then that negativity will be their downfall because Australia have the lightning pace capable of taking wickets even on the dullest of pitches.”\nDay 4 - Second Ashes Test (Frame content direct link: http://embed.scribblelive.com/Embed/v7.aspx?Id=1385798&ThemeId=27311 .)\nOriginally published as ‘We’ve played the perfect match’", "external_links": ["http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/ashes-2015-matt-prior--headaches-aplenty-now-aussies-have-their-mongrel-back-10399199.html", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/19/1227448/213080-1e39453e-2e01-11e5-acc9-b1d2ead0aaf5.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/19/1227448/366049-b1211992-2e17-11e5-a7c2-8f56938fe831.jpg", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-3166677/Stuart-Broad-no-demons-pitch-save-Test.html", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/19/1227448/350257-5f0d2a04-2e14-11e5-a7c2-8f56938fe831.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/20/1227448/421489-478e2146-2e26-11e5-9e0e-b22a5c868d19.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/19/1227448/145996-5f5af6c2-2df5-11e5-a7c2-8f56938fe831.jpg", "http://embed.scribblelive.com/Embed/v7.aspx?Id=1385798&ThemeId=27311", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/19/1227448/275087-0040ca8e-2e0b-11e5-a7c2-8f56938fe831.jpg", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/england/11749044/Ashes-2015-James-Anderson-and-Stuart-Broad-do-not-have-a-hope-for-England-on-pitch-like-this.html", "http://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/australia-vs-england-second-test-day-four-at-lords/story-fnu2penb-1227448146024", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/cricket/ashes-2015-three-englands-top-6095536", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/19/1227448/201921-7c3b7cd6-2dfe-11e5-a7c2-8f56938fe831.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/20/1227448/390163-5da7f518-2e1e-11e5-a7c2-8f56938fe831.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-20T09:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T20:23:46.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
