The public feel they have no check in this whatsoever,” Jones said on the program.\n“The Speaker is the third-most senior administrative person in the country. The Governor-General is the most important and the Prime Minister the second. They have a chartered allowance.\n“Now I know (Labor MP) Tony Burke was quite critical of this today. And I was looking at figures today and at Tony Burke’s charter expenditure.\n“A total expenditure between 2008 and 2013 of $316,000. Now in many instances they weren’t accounted for. I think the public are really tired of (them) dipping into taxpayers’ money and saying we can all be treated like potentates. The notion for example of going from Tullamarine to Geelong in a helicopter is just bloody ridiculous.”\nWhen asked if Ms Bishop should be treated the same as Peter Slipper, who was found guilty for misusing his parliamentary Cabcharge allowance, he avoided answering and referred to his point that it was a “wider issue”.\nLast November, Ms Bishop chartered a helicopter for a 90-kilometre trip from Melbourne to a party fundraiser near Geelong.\nThe matter was reported to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) who have now referred it to the Department of Finance, which will then determine if the matter is handed back to the AFP for further action.\nFollowing the furore surrounding the revelation, Prime Minister Tony Abbott placed Ms Bishop on “probation”.\n“The wider issue is a very simple one,” Jones told Q&A host Tony Jones. “How much does it cost to keep these people going? I am looking at figures here which are just staggering. One speaker went to Ethiopia and Switzerland for one month for $114,000. I mean this is the price of a house for many people in remote areas of Australia.\n“But between July and December, (former Labor MP) Harry Jenkins, $120,363. I mean, this is a gravy train that is basically out of control.”\nThe Gravy Train - @Mark_Butler_MP & Alan Jones discuss travel entitlements & comparisons to Peter Slipper #QandA http://t.co/EMvJdSsUbw\n— ABC Q&A (@QandA) July 20, 2015\nFormer deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer agreed the parliamentary allowances system should be re-examined so it can provide “clarity” for politicians.\n“The whole problem is there is a lack of absolute clarity of what is within entitlement, especially if you’re within a regional electorate that stretches hundreds of kilometres and what’s not in entitlement.\n“It is areas of grey they need clarifying, they can be clarified, and they need to be clarified because I tell you what, every single member of parliament and senate on both sides are going to be besmirched by this affair.\n“With regard to Bronwyn Bishop, now on probation, she is a busy person, she supports many good causes...she travels a lot. What she did was unacceptable, what she did was a massive error of judgment. She must pay it back. This is still an ongoing investigation and I will wait and see the outcome.”\nFormer Palmer United Party member, now Independent Senator Jacqui Lambie said she thought the Labor Party will have no choice but to call a no-confidence vote in Ms Bishop so she can be “scrutinised”.\n“I think it’s high time it was done,” she said.\nFollowing #choppergate, discussion turned to New South Wales Premier Mike Baird’s call to increase the GST, with the majority of the panel agreeing there needs to be a debate around the issue.\nHowever Ms Lambie said she didn’t think raising the GST was the answer.\nThe discussion then turned to the Liverpool Plain Shenhua open cut coal mine proposal.\nThe last question of the night was directed to 2GB host Alan Jones who was asked who he really was, with the questioner asking if his radio persona was “pure entertainment”.\nHis response:\n“Look I find that an extraordinary question,” he said to the questioner. “I am not too sure anyone who listens to my program could cite any listener that I have abused, shouted at or argued, plenty of politicians but not listeners. Because my task is to invite them to ring. I invite them. It would be abject discourtesy to then abuse them simply because they disagree with me. And often when they do I shut up which is unusual for me.\n“Anyone who listens to my program would know my listeners are my researchers. I treat them with total courtesy. On the other hand, I won't let policitians on to the program to talk nonsense without interrupting them.”\nOriginally published as ‘Gravy train that’s out of control’", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Mark_Butler_MP", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/QandA?src=hash", "http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/qanda-recap-choppergate-mp-expenses-gst-increase-and-the-shenhua-open-cut-mine-proposal/story-e6frfmyi-1227450017726", "https://twitter.com/QandA/status/623096626953912321", "http://t.co/EMvJdSsUbw"], "published": "2015-07-21T06:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T18:13:00.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
