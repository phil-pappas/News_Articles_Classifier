Then I realised that this would be a great learning experience, and would bring richness to my practice as well.” \nSudarshan was picked because he fit the bill perfectly, said Krishnamachari, president of the Kochi Biennale Foundation. \n“We all agreed that we needed an artist with good knowledge of art practice as well as theory and Sudarshan was one of the few artists who has comprehensive knowledge of theatre, art, architecture and has shown extensively at biennales around the world,” Krishnamachari said. “We have confidence that he will do a great job.” \nThe curators of both previous editions have also been Mumbai-based. \nKrishnamachari curated the inaugural show, while the curator of the second edition, held in 2014, was Jitish Kallat. That 108-day event showed works by 92 artists from 42 countries around the world, and was visited by 5 lakh people.
