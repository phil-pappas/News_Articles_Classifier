Chances are you've been to Canada on a skiing holiday to Whistler, Big White, Silver Star or Sun Peaks. \nThe ski fields of British Columbia and Alberta are packed with Aussies. It feels like almost every second person in Whistler or Silver Star is from Australia. \nMany young Australians head over to Canada's ski fields to work for a season or two. \nYou might have visited Jasper National Park and driven along the Icefield Park Way or perhaps you boarded the Rocky Mountaineer and saw the wonderful scenery of the Rocky Mountains from a comfortable seat on the train. \nThe Rocky Mountaineer is a splendid train journey through amazing scenery.
