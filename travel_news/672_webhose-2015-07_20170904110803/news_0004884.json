Try cruising with walkie-talkies 13th Jul 2015 12:00 AM Dianna Sutton from Flight Centre Mackay: \"Walkie talkies are a lifesaver.\" Related Items Local Real Estate Cars For Sale \nDianna Sutton from Flight Centre Mackay is passionate about cruising, especially when travelling with two active young boys. \nCarnival Cruise Line is a favourite of Dianna's. On a recent holiday to the South Pacific, she hoped to squeeze in a bit of family time, though she found the boys were more interested in hanging out in the kids club! \n\"That was a bit sad for me,\" she laughs, \"but I set them up with walkie talkies so we were always contactable. \n\"The amount of comments I received was incredible. That's the best tip I could give to my clients. Walkie talkies are a lifesaver. \n\"Along with the endless amount of things to do, the wonderful food, adults only area and activities for the kids, they're such a well-oiled company in the sense that nothing went wrong. Carnival is very much geared towards customer satisfaction. \n\"On the two Carnival Spirit cruises I've been on, we were unable to visit Mystery Island due to the weather, so instead we docked at Isle of Pines and Fiji! For the things that may go wrong, there's always a solution. \n\"From the moment you wake up to the moment you fall asleep, everything just falls into place. Carnival is amazing. We were never ever bored, and fortunately, I managed to spend some time with my boys!\" Call Flight Centre for your next holiday on 1300 772 571. cruise", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T04:14:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
