Instead of being crippled with anxiety about our lack of accommodation - as I'd suspected - we both felt strangely liberated.\nIt reminded us of misspent youths impulse booking grotty hostels in European cities because we couldn't afford to stay anywhere nicer.\n 2 Next Sailing away from the rat race: Couple quit their jobs, sell... Smokin' footage of Europe's most active volcano: Drone... The bullet train cleaners are lightning fast too! Timelapse... Stopped in its tracks: 120 passengers left stranded after... The freedom of not having a hotel ready-booked meant we were without any of the normal constraints one has on a short city break - we didn't feel the need to rush to the hotel, check in, dump baggage and immediately run about exploring.\nInstead, we felt we were on an adventure where anything could happen and where we could end up anywhere.\nSo we took a leisurely stroll through the city centre until we found a cafe and sat outside basking in the sun as we flicked through the BookingNow app.\nWorking on a similar premise to Uber, the app locates the hotels nearest to you and helpfully provides pictures, star rating and reviews by the most recent guests at the hotel, as well as all the usual information you would expect while booking online - amenities, location and price.\nClassical: The hotel was opened in 1919 and retains the vintage glamour of the era with its sumptuous furnishings and grand\nJunior suite: The beautifully airy suite boasts an enormous bed, flat screen TV, minibar and a rather fetching chandelier\nFine dining: The hotel boasts a Michelin-starred restaurant and another named the 19/Nineteen, located near the bar\nDelicious: Breakfast consisted of a huge buffet featuring everything from croissants and smoked salmon to dim sum and beef carpaccio\nIt was easy to use and pleasing to the eye, with a simple swipe action showing all of the hotels nearest to us.\nThe app even uses a map to show how close your hotel is and what route you should take to get there, similar to CityMapper.\nBOOKING NOW - UBER FOR HOTELS The booking process\nAim : Your perfect room is two taps away.\n- The new way to book when taking spontaneous trips, from Booking.com.\nWhy use it?\n• Small easy interactions (similar to Tinder swipe action)\n• Solves the problem of ‘too much choice’\n• Streamlined, on–demand mobile booking app (it's like Uber, but for hotels)\n• On-the-go solution for holiday-makers to effortlessly book the nearest hotel that matches their personal preferences (breakfast, WiFi, cost)\nIt's perfect for: Road-trip/city break/business trip/spontaneous holiday\nBonus features\n• Reference reviews and ratings quickly\n• Mapped directions to your hotel\n• Rate check-in instantly\n• The biggest wealth of stays to choose from of any accommodation site (635,000)\nFlicking through the really rather impressive array of hotels available that evening, one in particular caught my eye - the rather grand sounding El Palace Hotel Barcelona.\nAll of the reviews for The Palace were reassuringly flattering, and focussed particularly on the excellent staff who were described as attentive, helpful and friendly.\nThe clincher was the fact that it is home to the Michelin star The Caelis Restaurant which sounded simply delicious.\nAnd so after checking the reviews (which were excellent) and rating (5*) I clicked the book button - and voila! Our reservation for two nights in the lap of luxury was made.\nThe Palace is located in the Eixample District, close to Las Ramblas and surrounded by boulevards, boutiques and plenty of culture - La Sagrada Familia is just a 15-minute walk away, as is the Gothic quarter and its abundance of fantastic vintage shops.\nOpened in 1919, the hotel is an oasis of old-school luxury and opulence in the very heart of Barcelona. It comes complete with be-hatted doorman, revolving gilt doors, tasteful greenery and a small red carpet.\nEverything from its heavy muted green velvet drapes to its richly upholstered sofas and large golden chandeliers scream exclusivity.\nUpon arrival a friendly doorman immediately grabbed our bags and pointed the way to reception so we could check in.\nAfter a brief and unfortunate moment where one of the men behind reception did not seem to quite believe we were staying in his establishment - hello, Pretty Woman moment - we were guided into the beautifully grand lounge area where we indulged in a glass of cava and some delicious nibbles - sugar coated pistachios, kettle chips and Parmesan cheese straws\nWhen we arrived at our junior suite on the fourth floor a complimentary bottle of cava was on ice waiting for us, along with a box of Lindt chocolates and mineral water.\nThe suite itself was absolutely beautiful and spacious to boot.\nDecorated in a classic style it boasted a huge bed, comfy sofa with matching armchairs, a large 37\" flat screen television, mini bar, climate control, a walk-in wardrobe and the bathroom of my dreams.\nOh, the bathroom. Italian marble, double sink, double shower (with two rain showers), a whirlpool bath and exceedingly flattering lighting.\nComplimentary robes and slippers awaited us along with L´Occitane en Provence bathroom goodies.\nThe room was also treated to twice-daily housekeeping and a turn-down service which featured an adorable little card and chocolate popped on your pillow every night. It was delightful.\nRoom service: The hotel offers 24-hour room service and the extensive menu includes delicious locally sourced tapas and cava\nBaking: The Palace has an award-winning Mayan Luxury Spa which boasts a deliciously hot Temazcal Sauna - the only one in Europe\nThe next morning we enjoyed breakfast basking in the sun in the hotel's small but beautifully formed garden.\nBreakfast was not included in the price and was an additional 38 euros each. It consisted of a huge buffet featuring everything from croissants and smoked salmon to dim sum and beef carpaccio - a reflection of its clientèle's tastes.\nThe Palace also has an award-winning Mayan Luxury Spa and Fitness Room, featuring a Temazcal Sauna - the only one in Europe.\nAs check out is at 12pm we decided to give the sauna a go (at an additional 30 Euro each) before we caught a taxi to the airport.\nThe spa was compact but stylish and the sauna itself was delightful - baking hot dry heat, warmer than your average sauna, and came with a heavy ceramic jug full of eucalyptus scented water to pour intermittently over the open coal brazier .\nAlong with its Michelin-starred restaurant - The Caelis, which was unfortunately closed during our stay - The Palace has a second restaurant, the 19/Nineteen, and a cocktail bar in the basement.\nApart from our initial, rather icy reception, every other member of staff was above reproach - they were friendly and approachable throughout our stay without being toadying and provided exactly the kind of service you would expect from a 5-star hotel.\nAs for BookingNow, the app would be particularly useful for those who enjoy a 'fly by the seat of your pants' kind of experience which allows you to impulse book anything and everything from a hostel to a luxury suite.\nIt looks good, it's pretty much foolproof, it's free and all you need is a decent internet connection - and I know I'll be using it again in the very near future.\nLounging about: We enjoy a glass of cava and some nibbles in the Palace's sumptuously furnished lounge area", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1LNXdTV"], "published": "2015-07-04T16:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T11:29:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
