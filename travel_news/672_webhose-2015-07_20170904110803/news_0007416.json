If you want more information, take a look at the webcams or check other people's social accounts to get updates, photos or videos. \nMcKenzie said one of the most noticeable changes was inside the resort. \n\"There are a lot more heads down in the cafe and while you still see people talking, there's not as much as there used to be.\" \nChairlifts are a popular place to spend time on your phone. \nBut the tech is not only for the skiers and snowboarders. Resorts are using it constantly. \n\"Connectivity helps us make better decisions while we operate in an aggressive environment,\" said McKenzie. \nMt Hutt staff use iPads to identify people as they come through the lift gates. While this is primarily to stop people misusing passes, it's also used to find people to let them know if their car lights are on or if someone is trying to locate them. \nHere are some tips to get teched up for the ski season: \nAPPS \nThe first app Kiwi skiers and boarders should download is the Met Service's Snow Weather (free for Android and Apple). You choose a mountain as your \"home\" though you also \"favourite\" other resorts. It gives you forecasts, current conditions and webcams to check the situation. \nThe Metservice's app. \nThe other popular apps for mountain users are those that track and map your runs and collate stats such as maximum speed, distance travelled and vertical metres. \nThey are suprisingly addictive and you can get competitive with yourself in trying to beat your previous personal best. My favourite is Trace Snow (free for Android and Apple), as it has a simple interface and also stops tracking automatically once you leave the mountain. Others worth trying are Snowcru (free) and Ski Tracks ($1.29), both for Apple and Android. \nOther handy apps are Apple's Find Friends (free) to help locate mates on the mountain. \nCAMERAS \nThere are a lot of GoPros on New Zealand mountains as people record themselves and friends charging down the slopes or performing in the park. \nGoPros are the fan favourite and the company has just released a smaller version, the Hero4 Session . \nMcKenzie said the cameras are so popular they are now selling them in the shop at Mt Hutt. He also said ski selfie sticks are used a lot on the mountain. \nBut GoPros aren't the only option. Sony has three models of its Action Cam, starting from $349. \nIf you don't want to buy a new camera you can get a case for your phone and put it on your helmet, or just hold it. Hitcase makes tough cases for iPhones that come with a range of accessories so you can mount them on just about anything. Their prices start at $100. \nSOCIAL MEDIA \nIf you or your friends ski or board then come winter your Facebook, Twitter and Instagram feeds are probably full of snow antics. \nInstagram is increasing popular in New Zealand and several mountains, including Mt Hutt , Cardrona and Rainbow have accounts. Most of those pics are for publicity but searching hashtags will show up plenty of pictures from people on the mountain. \nMany resorts also are on Facebook and Twitter and they are good place to get information, or if things go bad, to complain. \nWEBSITES \nA fun part of skiing is improving your skills. While you can always use an instructor, technology can also help in the form of websites. \nFor Kiwi snowboarders, Snowboard Addiction is a great site. Started by a Kiwi who now lives in Whistler, the site features videos to help everyone from learners to those wanting to progress in the park. It has a selection of free videos but for the full package you need to pay US$59 (NZ$86) \nSkiers can try the YouTube channel of Elate Media which has dozens of videos for a range of abilities. \nRELATED STORY", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T02:32:03.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
