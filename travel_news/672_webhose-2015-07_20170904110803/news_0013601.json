Jul 2, 2015, 3:01pm EDT Updated Photo by Terry Goss, copyright 2006, via Wikimedia Commons North Carolina has seen an increase in the frequency of shark attacks on humans this… more Just as the biggest summer holiday for beach destinations is getting underway, the recent rise in shark attacks off the coast of North Carolina may be growing more difficult to ignore. Another incident occurred Wednesday, marking seven victims bitten in the waters off N.C. beaches in less than a month. And that's not counting at least two more that occurred during the same period in South Carolina. By comparison, four shark attacks were reported in North Carolina for the entire previous year. Business Pulse But so far, businesses in the area don't seem to be suffering much , according to an article from the Wilmington Star-News . “We've had a few people ask about the sharks and what's going on … but really, really small numbers,\" Wit Tuttell , executive director of Visit N.C., told that newspaper. He noted that tourist spending this year is on track to beat last year's total of $21.3 billion. While some visitors may be extra cautious about swimming, Tuttell said, most are not likely to cancel their vacations. Indeed, one beachwear shop at Oak Island, where two teens lost limbs in separate attacks that occurred in a single day, told Time Warner Cable News that while overall business has been good, more customers are skipping the bathing suits and boogie boards this year. Likewise, a beach rentals company says it has seen less demand for watersports equipment. \"Shark Attack\" shirts, on the other hand, reportedly are selling at a brisk pace at an Eagles store in the same town. Still, the owner of Carolina Watersports in Oak Island told the Star-News that his rental boats and watercraft are already sold out for this weekend, although he has taken calls from customers with questions about the incidents. “I think they understand that what happened, while it was tragic, the risks are very small and it's so isolated,\" Tuttell said of visitors to the state's beaches, according to that report. “Will people maybe spend a little more time on the beach than in the water? Maybe, but I think they're still going to come.” Experts have cited a number of possible explanations for the rise in the number of attacks , including warmer weather, higher salinity due to drought conditions and abundant food near the shore. \nWant Charlotte Travel news in your inbox?
