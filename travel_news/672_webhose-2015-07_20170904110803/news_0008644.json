On the one hand, too little water in the river means vessels can’t sail because they could run aground. Too much water and they can’t move, because they can’t get under bridges or access their docking areas. High water is most likely in spring when rivers are swollen by rain and snow melt, but flooding – due to persistent rainfall – can happen at any time. In June 2013, towns and cities along the Danube were devastated in the worst floods seen for centuries. In the Bavarian city of Passau, streets were turned into canals; in Budapest, a state of emergency was declared as water levels rose to 29 feet. • Cruise lines cut fares by 60 per cent Unsurprisingly, all river cruises on the river had to be cancelled as it was too dangerous to operate and the vessels moorings were under several feet of water. Low water can occur any time. Passengers on the Danube this week had their cruises disrupted and cancelled as a heatwave and resutling drought hit parts of Europe. However, cruising in winter can be as unpredictable, as cruise editor Teresa Machan discovered on a Christmas markets cruise in December 2011 . Then, the Rhine and Danube dried up so much that a once-submerged Second World war bomb was spotted near Koblenz and Budapest was closed to cruise traffic for more than a week. • Highlights of a Nile river cruise: in pictures The immediate cause of low water is, of course, a shortage of rainfall, but the problem is exacerbated when there is a drought after a dry winter, when there hasn’t been the usual precipitation and snow melt to top up the river at the start of the season. On Machan’s cruise, the captain blamed the low water on early snow melt in the spring follwed by a severe autumn drought. Tried and tested solutions It would be wrong to assume that there are always low or high-water problems on the rivers, but it happens enough for the river cruise companies to have contingency plans in place. I was on the Elbe with Viking River Cruises earlier this month, supposedly sailing from Magdeburg in Germany to Mělník in the Czech Republic, but we came to a standstill half way along, in Meissen, due to low water. The Elbe suffers more than most rivers during the summer Our ship docked there and were bussed each day to all the places we should have visited by river – Dresden, Bad Schandau in Saxon Switzerland and Litomerice in the Czech Republic. As we would have been docked in the city of Dresden for the day, and therefore able to return to our ship, the Schumann, for lunch, Viking instead paid everyone to have lunch in a restaurant in the city. It was also made clear at the outset that passengers would be compensated for the disruption. • Luxury cruises: 12 incredible rooms on the river A revised daily itinerary was explained at the evening port talks by the programme director, with an alternative tour laid on one day for those who had had enough of long coach journeys. Busing people between the boat and towns and cities is often the only option, but where possible, for instance if the high or low water is affecting a specific area, companies will transfer passengers from one vessel to another to get around the problem.On her cruise, Machan started on one Scenic vessel, was switched to a day boat to sail through the Rhine Gorge and finally, in Mainz, joined the craft she should have been on. Of course none of this is perfect when you have paid for a river cruise but most people do understand there is nothing anyone can do. One person posting on a passenger forum on cruisecrtic.co.uk this Quote: : “We’ve decided we will have a good time no matter what … if the bus rides get too long we can just explore locally.” On a Rhine Christmas cruise in 2012 with Amadeus River Cruises, high water meant we could not get under the bridge to Strasbourg so the captain docked in Mannheim and a coach was laid on to take people to the French city. Those of us who didn’t fancy the long drive went into town, found a tram to Heidelberg and spent Christmas day there instead. Many on my Elbe cruise were especially disappointed to have missed seeing the high rock formations as we sailed into Saxon Switzerland. But as one passenger said: “I know we need rain but walking around Dresden in the wet would not have been the same. I guess you can’t have everything.” The worst offenders The bad news is that most rivers in Europe can be affected by high or low water. On the plus side it doesn’t mean that all river cruises will be cancelled. At the time of writing Uniworld River Cruises had cancelled a Danube cruise that was due to sail tomorrow but other companies have been able to continue sailing, albeit on a slightly altered itinerary, because their vessels have shallower drafts. Avalon Waterways said its ships Avalon Vista and Impression are operating under ‘contingency plans’, holding out hope that rain has been forecast and the situation can change daily. The worst offender for low water is the Elbe, which is why few companies sail there – despite the fabulous sights you can see on the way. However, things are changing, with CroisiEurope launching a paddlewheel craft on the river next spring which it says will be able to operate year-round, even in low water. Passengers on a Viking ship cruise through Jochenstein lock, on the Danube This year it launched a paddlewheel on the Loire in France, becoming the first company to operate a hotel boat on the river, generally avoided due to notoriously shallow water. Viking had to cancel the Elbe sailing scheduled after mine and this week has cancelled cruises on both the Schumann and Fontane. However, it also has two new Longships on the Elbe, both with shallower drafts, and these are continuing to sail an ‘adjusted’ itinerary on the river. Help from unexpected sources While rain is usually the only solution to the low water problem, man can sometimes help things along. During two days of my Elbe cruise, all four of Viking’s vessels were grounded. Then the two Longships started to sail again, which the captain said was because of their shallower draft. So everyone was surprised when Viking Fontane, a sister craft to Schumann, passed us on her way downsteam towards Magdeburg. The captain explained the locks in the Czech Republic had opened, creating a wave - and extra depth of water - that she was able to ride.
