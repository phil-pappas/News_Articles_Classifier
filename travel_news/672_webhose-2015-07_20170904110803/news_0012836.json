The photo that sparked a backlash. Picture: LisaF TSA Media Source: Twitter \nLISA Farbstein frequently shares images of bizarre and banned items that passengers try to sneak onto planes, uploading them to her Twitter account . \nMs Farbstein is a spokeswoman for the US airport security body the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and it’s safe to say she has seen it all. \nSo when she posted this image of a bag stuffed full of cash, asking; “Is this how you’d transport it?”, she thought it would intrigue her followers. Instead, it had the opposite effect. \nNot only did Ms Farbstein mention that it happened to contain $US75,000 (nearly $AUD100,000), but she also included the location of the bag — Virginia’s Richmond Airport. If you had $75,000, is this how you'd transport it? Just asking! TSA @ #RIC spotted this traveler's preferred method. pic.twitter.com/lriNbivmsT — TSAmedia_LisaF (@TSAmedia_LisaF) June 30, 2015 \nFurious Twitter users argued that her Tweet was a violation of the passenger’s privacy and contained too much detail. . @TSAmedia_LisaF it's absolutely appalling that you're posting photos of private citizens' belongings. You & your agency should be ashamed. — Nicki Neily (@nickineily) June 30, 2015 @alangura @nickineily @TSAmedia_LisaF Is this why you miss all those guns and bombs, too busy posting pics of other people's money? — Matthew Carberry (@CarberryMatthew) June 30, 2015 @TSAmedia_LisaF Were they planning on using that to bring down a plane? Why are you showing people's personal belongings? Oh yeah, you suck.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T08:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T09:09:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
