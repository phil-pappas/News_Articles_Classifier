That's what the 60-strong building team at Quebec City's Hotel de Glace have to do to keep their unique accommodation running.\nThe magic of Disney means Queen Elsa of Arendelle, from the enormously successful feature film Frozen, means such a fate doesn't befall her beautiful structure.\nFrozen's director Chris Buck and the animators took inspiration from the hotel for the fairytale Frozen castle and to gain an understanding of how ice works, with Buck himself staying there as part of a research trip five years prior to the movie's release.\nThe animated ice palace from Disney's Frozen is clearly unrestricted by unforgiving nature of ice but still looks remarkably real\nPrincess Anna marvels at Elsa's castle in the film which is based on Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale The Snow Queen\nThe Frozen crew visit ice palace, Hotel de Glace in Quebec more videos 1 2 3 4 Watch video Moment crocodile SNAPS after woman jumps into enclosure\nWatch video The vine covered Chemin de fer de Petite Ceinture in Paris\nWatch video Man keeps passing out on slingshot ride in Magaluf\nWatch video Laura Kennington introduces her Caspian Challenge kayak\nWatch video 'Randy' bulls hosed to keep them away from tree wedged cow\nWatch video The Frozen crew visit ice palace, Hotel de Glace in Quebec\nWatch video The view from Matavenero, the abandoned village in Spain\nWatch video Mont Saint-Michel: Breath-taking inspiration for Tangled\nWatch video Sloshed!

Visitors can walk to the real one at low tide and take the bridge at high tide - a feature that's made it tricky to invade throughout history.\nDisney used the fortified island village and castle of Mont Saint-Michel in Normandy, France, as inspiration for Rapunzel's castle\nThe towers and Italian Romanesque style abbey were transformed to be the rather elaborate home of Rapunzel's parents from which the heroine is taken\nMont Saint-Michel: Breath-taking inspiration for Tangled more videos 1 2 3 4 Watch video Moment crocodile SNAPS after woman jumps into enclosure\nWatch video The vine covered Chemin de fer de Petite Ceinture in Paris\nWatch video Man keeps passing out on slingshot ride in Magaluf\nWatch video Laura Kennington introduces her Caspian Challenge kayak\nWatch video 'Randy' bulls hosed to keep them away from tree wedged cow\nWatch video The Frozen crew visit ice palace, Hotel de Glace in Quebec\nWatch video The view from Matavenero, the abandoned village in Spain\nWatch video Mont Saint-Michel: Breath-taking inspiration for Tangled\nWatch video Sloshed!

His name is based on the Hindi word Bhalu, which stands for several species of bear.\nJust as the big guy defends Mowgli from nasty tiger Shere Khan, it's not unheard of for a sloth bear to take on a big cat - as out image below shows - to defend its cubs.\nRudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book is set in the Indian jungle which includes 45 wildlife sanctuaries and 100 national parks\nBaloo's character is based on the mostly black sloth bear (left) species which is found on the Indian subcontinent\nJust as Baloo defends his honorary man cub Mowgli from Shere Khan, sloth bears will stand up to a real-life tiger if they have to\nTHE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE\nMACHU PICCHU, PERU\nEmperor and llama Kusco's empire is a fanciful version of real life ruins known as Machu Picchu, one of the world's most famous and revered sites.\nThey made no secret of it, with the Incan settlement built around 1450 being found in the region of Cusco, Peru, about 8,000 feet above sea level in the Andes.\nWhile it's easy to get up there by train from Cuzco city in about 90 minutes , many chose to hike over four or five days (and unless truly commitment, catch the train back down).\nThe mountains and Incan ruins of Machu Picchu in Peru were the inspiration for The Emperor's New Groove\nThe film starring the voices of David Spade and John Goodman centres around the emperor Kuzco, named after the area's surroundings\nTimelapse footage shows hordes of tourists visiting Machu Picchu more videos 1 2 3 4 Watch video Moment crocodile SNAPS after woman jumps into enclosure\nWatch video The vine covered Chemin de fer de Petite Ceinture in Paris\nWatch video Man keeps passing out on slingshot ride in Magaluf\nWatch video Laura Kennington introduces her Caspian Challenge kayak\nWatch video 'Randy' bulls hosed to keep them away from tree wedged cow\nWatch video The Frozen crew visit ice palace, Hotel de Glace in Quebec\nWatch video The view from Matavenero, the abandoned village in Spain\nWatch video Mont Saint-Michel: Breath-taking inspiration for Tangled\nWatch video Sloshed!

A popular part of the hikes is jump off rock ledges at the falls.\nThe target destination for Carl Fredricksen in Up, Paradise Falls, is primarily based on Angel Falls in Venezuela's Canaima National Park\nMr Fredriksen and his Wilderness Explorer pal Russell (left) in the brilliant action adventure animation and the fictional Paradise Falls\nFINDING NEMO\nTHE GREAT BARRIER REEF, AUSTRALIA\nFinding Nemo is Marlin the clown fish's journey from the Great Barrier Reef , a World Heritage Site in the Coral Sea off Queensland, to Sydney.\nThe reef, one of the seven natural wonders of the world, are made up of 2,900 individual reefs, 900 islands across across 344,400 square km and should be seen to be believed and enjoyed before they're gone.\nThe adorable fish in water comedy-adventure finding Nemo begins in the Great Barrier Reef but the wildlife starkly resembles reality\nMarlin's adventure from the reef to Sydney, away from the safety of the sea anemones (real version right), was a worldwide blockbuster\nTurtle with GoPro shows the reef from a new perspective more videos 1 2 3 4 Watch video Laura Bassett's own goal blunder in semi-final injury time\nWatch video GRAPHIC CONTENT: Mineral oil is released from infected arm\nWatch video Harrowing moment a Great White nearly rips apart diving cage\nWatch video First-grader shuts down ranting preacher with rainbow flag\nWatch video Homeless man's amazing piano skills wow passers by\nWatch video Horrifying footage shows savage bully attack on 13 year-old...\nWatch video Cute kitten uses golden retriever as doggy climbing frame\nWatch video Rottweiler shows owner his 'mean face' on command\nWatch video Police armed with tasers called to cafe to tackle a GHOST\nWatch video Driver passes a motorcyclist by mounting the pavement\nWatch video Shocking moment lioness attempts to get into car\nWatch video Moment man 'pulls spider from his ear' in clever fake video\nBEAUTY AND THE BEAST\nCHATEAU DE CHAMBORD, LOIRE VALLEY, FRANCE\nThe Renaissance-style Chateau de Chambord in France's Loire Valley was the basis for The Beast's palace in this classic Disney film.\nThe building was constructed by King Francis I of France, and although never finished remains a hugely recognisable landmark that can be visited by the public.\nWhile the presentation of the place comes in the form of royal historical tours, the likeness to the film's various famous settings is uncanny.\nRenaissance-style Chateau de Chambord in the Loire Valley in France (left) was the basis for The Beast's palace in this classic Disney film\nThe building was constructed by King Francis I of France, and although never finished remains a hugely popular tourist destination\nINTO THE WOODS\nWINDSOR GREAT PARK, ENGLAND\nThe pine forest of Windsor Great Park features prominently in Into The Woods, which was mostly filmed in London's Shepperton Studios with scenes also shot at Dover Castle, Waverley Abbey and Richmond Park.\nWindsor Great Park's artificial waterfall provided the perfect backdrop for the duet Agony while Byfleet Manor in Surrey was Cinderella's home.\nThe ancient pine forest of Windsor Great Park outside London features prominently in the feature film Into The Woods\nThe pine trees of Great Windsor Park look beautiful in autumn and proved a perfect backdrop for the dark live action fairytale\nTHE LION KING\nTHE SERENGETI, KENYA\nFrom the dramatic expanse of the grasslands to the animals themselves, Kenya's Serengeti plays a prominent role in one of Disney's greatest triumphs.\nPlants such as the distinctive Acacia trees along with other flora and fauna helped bring the film to life, albeit with trademark cartoon touches.\nBaboon Rafiki speaks with Simba on 'Pride Rock' in The Lion King (left) while a mother and lion cub sit in a remarkably simlar location\nSLEEPING BEAUTY\nNEUSCHWANSTEIN CASTLE, GERMANY\nBavaria's Neuschwanstein Castle has become so much more than Sleeping Beauty's castle, it is now the symbol of Disney itself along with a common thread in the company's biggest theme parks.\nIn real life, it's a 19th century-built structure on a hill in southwest Bavaria that was originally commissioned to be a retreat for Ludwig II. Its remote location saved it from two world wars and the castle can now be visited by members of the public.\nBavaria's Neuschwanstein Castle has become so much more than Sleeping Beauty's castle, it is now the symbol of Disney itself along with a common thread in the company's biggest theme parks\nAmazing drone video of German castle that inspired Walt Disney more videos 1 2 3 4 Watch video Laura Bassett's own goal blunder in semi-final injury time\nWatch video GRAPHIC CONTENT: Mineral oil is released from infected arm\nWatch video Harrowing moment a Great White nearly rips apart diving cage\nWatch video First-grader shuts down ranting preacher with rainbow flag\nWatch video Homeless man's amazing piano skills wow passers by\nWatch video Horrifying footage shows savage bully attack on 13 year-old...\nWatch video Cute kitten uses golden retriever as doggy climbing frame\nWatch video Rottweiler shows owner his 'mean face' on command\nWatch video Police armed with tasers called to cafe to tackle a GHOST\nWatch video Driver passes a motorcyclist by mounting the pavement\nWatch video Shocking moment lioness attempts to get into car\nWatch video Moment man 'pulls spider from his ear' in clever fake video\nBRAVE\nEILEAN DONAN CASTLE, SCOTLAND\nScotland should be in the credits among the star voices Kelly Macdonald, Billy Connolly and Emma Thompson - it plays that big a part. In places it offers inspiration, in others it provides a total carbon print for a part of the animated set.\nThis is the case for the Eilean Donan Castle in the Highlands. Brave tells the tale of a rebellious young Scottish girl named Merida (voiced by Macdonald) and prominently features the colours and contours of the country.\nEilean Donan Castle in the Scottish Highlands formed the basis of the castle in Brave, the story of rebellious young Scottish girl Merida\nBrave prominently features the colours and contours of Scotland along with the distinctive voices of Kelly Macdonald and Billy Connolly\nALADDIN\nTAJ MAHAL, INDIA\nUnmistakable Indian landmark the Taj Mahal may be a tomb but there's nothing morbid about Aladdin, the film which decided it would provide the perfect basis for the title character's elaborate home.\nThe real structure was built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in tribute to his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal, and was finished in 1648.\nWhile Aladdin was regarded part of a period dubbed Disney's Renaissance, the Taj Mahal is one of the Seven Wonders of the World.\nThe Taj Mahal, finished in 1648 by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in tribute to his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal, was the basis for Aladdin's castle\nRATATOUILLE\nTHE FRENCH LAUNDRY, CALIFORNIA\nWhile Ratatouille is of course primarily set on the streets of Paris, the restaurant Auguste Gusteau's is based mostly on three Michelin-starred The French Laundry , Thomas Keller's Napa Valley icon where a fixed priced tasting menu costs US$295 (£187).\nThe film, while also being the heartwarming tale of a rat who loved to cook controlling a hapless human, it has also been acclaimed for its attention to detail when it came to the culinary elements.\nThomas Keller's three Michelin-starred restaurant The French Laundry was the inspiration for Ratatouille's Auguste Gusteau's\nRatatouille is based around the adventures of Remy the rat (left), a brilliant chef, and his hapless friend Linguini (right)\nRead more: Hotel de Glace — Quebec City's Ice Hotel Site officiel de l�office de tourisme du mont saint michel - Home page India Jungle Tours Packages of India, Jungle Tours In India, Tours to Indian Jungle Experiences in the region - Great Barrier Reef Accueil | Chambord Anglais | Just another Chambord Sites site The French Laundry | Thomas Keller Restaurant Group Serengeti - The National Park's Official Site Welcome to Eilean Donan Castle | Eilean Donan Welcome To Official WebSite of Taj Mahal-U.P.Tourism Windsor Great Park - Windsor", "external_links": ["http://www.windsor.gov.uk/things-to-do/windsor-great-park-p236491", "http://www.eileandonancastle.com/", "http://www.tajmahal.gov.in/", "http://www.thomaskeller.com/tfl", "http://www.indiajungletours.com/", "http://www.ot-montsaintmichel.com/en/accueil.htm", "http://chambord.org/en/", "http://www.serengeti.org/", "http://dailym.ai/1dzFpNm", "http://www.hoteldeglace-canada.com/", "http://www.greatbarrierreef.org/tourism_overview.php"], "published": "2015-07-02T15:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T15:59:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
