Photographer's Note \nI had arranged for my driver, Erick, to take me to Chichen Itza, and a three-nights stay. En route, I wanted him to take me to the Maya site of Yaxuna, about 20 kilometres southwest of Chichen, dating back to the Early Classic. You see, I had visited Coba on an earlier trip to Mexico and observed the start of the grand highway the Maya had built west to Yaxuna to consolidate their commercial and political interests. Of course, I wanted to see the terminal point of this sacbe. This did not happen. As far as I can tell, the jungle has taken over Yaxuna. I probably needed a helicopter to land me at the central plaza. Erick and I had to make do with what we could accomplish. High grass, brush, trees, and insects have taken charge - possibly all at the behest of the Maya gods. We drove as far as we could into the site, which was not far at all. Then it was a matter of wading through the growths. Nothing is labelled, of course. What you see is what you get. These stairs lead upward to the ruins of possibly a palace/temple structure. Feel free to make up your own mind. I certainly do not regret my experience there. \nNobody has marked this note useful", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T12:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T15:42:45.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
