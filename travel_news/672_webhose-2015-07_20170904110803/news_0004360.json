This extraordinary travel adventure will encompass 62 unique destinations in 25 countries, with numerous late-night and overnight stays allowing ample time to take in all the amazing sights, sounds, and flavours of great cities, great wine regions, and architectural spectacles both old and new.\nDeparting 6 January 2017, the elegant, all-suite Silver Whisper will sail from San Francisco Bay for the idyllic isles of Hawaii and cross the International Date Line to the South Pacific, New Zealand, and Australia. Then, weaving her way through such tropical wonderlands as Bali and Sandakan, she will arrive at the shores of vibrant Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Singapore, before setting a course for the ancient temples of India, Arabia’s enchanting desert dunes, and the storied capitals of the Mediterranean.\nKristian Anderson,Silversea’s senior vice president of sales and general manager for the Americas, said: “World voyages are all about cultural immersion, new discoveries, and having time to get to know your fellow travellers. Our intimate Silver Whisper accommodates just 382 guests, providing the perfect club-like ambience where cosmopolitan guests can mingle and form lasting friendships as they journey to experience some of the most fascinating and secluded places on Earth.”\nEnhanced Array of Added-Value Amenities\nGuests sailing the full 116 days of World Cruise 2017 will enjoy a variety of special amenities, including a gala Bon Voyage reception, dinner and overnight stay at the Four Seasons Hotel in San Francisco, baggage valet service, business class air and transfers (between airport, hotel, and Silver Whisper), a $4,000 Onboard Spending Credit (per double-occupancy suite), complimentary laundry service, and commemorative gifts.
