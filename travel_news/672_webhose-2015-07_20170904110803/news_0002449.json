Lemmon succeeds Amy Jensen , who left the organization near the end of the most recent season, ultimately taking the top finance job at The Water Council in Milwaukee. Lemmon's hiring follows an extensive six-month national search, said Alec Fraser , president of the Skylight board. “Skylight is a top-notch organization that is thought of very highly all over the country,\" Fraser said. \"We drew a highly qualified pool of candidates and we are confident Jack Lemmon is the right person for the job. The Board of Directors is excited to partner with Jack in building a strong future for Skylight.” Most recently, Lemmon served as executive director of the Birmingham Children’s Theatre, a professional theater company serving more than 150,000 children annually in Alabama and the Southeast. He has served more than 30 years as an executive director and as a funder with the National Endowment for the Arts . In his work across the country, the Skylight said, he has significantly strengthened the organizations he managed through increasing earned and contributed revenues, developing efficient operations and focusing on deepening the organizations' connections back to the communities they serve. Lemmon holds a bachelor's in music education and performance from Coe College in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and a master's in theater from the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. “It is a great joy to join Skylight Music Theatre ,\" Lemmon said in a press release. \"Skylight produces the full breadth of musical theater over the centuries and helps push the art form forward to reach new audiences. I am looking forward to being able to team with Viswa (Skylight artistic director Viswa Subbaraman), the board and the staff to ensure that Milwaukee is well served by this vibrant, exciting and important arts institution.” Lemmon and his wife, Beverly, are in the process of moving to their new home in Milwaukee and will begin working at Skylight on July 13. \nWant Milwaukee Travel news in your inbox?
