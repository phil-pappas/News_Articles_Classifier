VPC Car rental companies have been chasing customers who don’t fill up their tanks all the way when they return their vehicles. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) \nThere may be no drier subject in the travel business than car rental fuel purchase options, but when the emails began flooding my in-box about Hertz’s new “Express Fuel” option, the topic suddenly turned interesting. \nOne of them came from Sara Mattes, a retired politician from Boston. She’s concerned about the new policy, which takes effect July 15. If you rent a car and drive less than 75 miles, Hertz will automatically bill you $13.99 for fuel unless you show a receipt proving you filled the tank. \n“Who would read this fine print?” she asks. “Who would think to keep that last receipt?” \nCar rental companies, not just Hertz, have been chasing customers who don’t fill up their tanks all the way when they return their vehicles. The way they see it, drivers who bring back their cars with anything less than a full tank aren’t paying for their entire rental. Consumers have a different perspective. They feel that they’re stuck between several difficult choices, and no matter what they do, the company ends up winning. “Express Fuel” just makes it even more perplexing. USA TODAY What you should know before renting a car \nHertz is not driving down this road alone. Avis already offers a similar product called “EZFuel.” Other car rental companies have begun informally asking customers to show a fuel receipt. But so far, they’ve been reluctant to put their policies in writing. \nHertz is calling Express Fuel an “option” intended to provide convenience for its low-mileage customers driving 75 miles or less during their rentals. \n“Rather than refilling their gas tanks before returning their car, Hertz will take care of the refueling for an affordable, competitive rate of $13.99, getting travelers on their way and where they need to be, faster,” says Anna Bootenhoff, a Hertz spokeswoman. \nAuto rental consultant Neil Abrams says the new policy is justified. “Savvy renters have learned that they can drive considerable distances without the gas gauge moving, thereby evading responsibility to replace spent fuel,” he says. \nPlus, the fee is a pretty good deal, he adds. If you do the math, 75 miles represents about 3.75 gallons of fuel. That works out to roughly $11.25 at current fuel prices, and Hertz is charging $13.99. \nBut not everyone agrees. A closer look at the terms of Express Fuel shows several problem areas, according to consumer advocate John Mattes, who also happens to be Sara Mattes’ brother. He notes that while you’re responsible for returning the car with a full tank, Hertz isn’t responsible for giving you a car with a full tank — an obvious double standard. \nHertz says it will only hold renters responsible for filling the tank up to the original fuel levels. \n“Please explain the logic of a $13 charge to renters who just filled up the tank — that simply because they did not get the paper receipt, they will be punished,” says Mattes. \nIt’s too soon to say how this policy will be enforced by Hertz, but in the past, that is exactly how other car rental companies have interpreted their fuel rules: If you can’t show a receipt, pay up. And in many of those cases, the charges were for far more than $13.99. \nWhen Michael Gates, a health care worker from Riverside, Ill., returned his Budget rental to the airport in Portland, Me., recently, he says he filled the tank, as he’s always done over 45 years of renting cars. A representative noted the mileage and fuel tank level. But later, he discovered a $49 “fuel service” charge on his credit card bill. He asked the company to remove the fee. \n“I was told I had to prove that I had filled the tank by submitting a receipt,” says Gates. He protested, and Budget eventually removed the charge. \nThat may be the takeaway from new policies adopted, both officially and unofficially, by the car rental industry. There’s always something new right around the corner when it comes to fuel charges. \n. For example, Avis presents its customers with three: a traditional “fuel service” option, where you prepay for a tank of gas; EZFuel, which says if you drive less than 75 miles, you’ll pay a service charge; and the “self-service” option, where you return the car with a full tank. A fuel receipt is required with this last option. \nIf you’re not confused yet, you will be. \nHow to get the most from your fuel purchase option \nIf you return your rental with less than a full tank of gas, the company will charge up to three times the market rate for gas to refill it. But you can avoid having to pay a premium by choosing one of these options. \n• Prepay: This option allows you to pay in advance for a full tank of gas, usually at a competitive rate. \nIs it worth it? Not always. If you don’t return the car on “empty,” you’re overpaying. \n• EZFuel or Express Fuel: Allows you to pay a fixed price for fuel if you drive less than 75 miles. \nIs it worth it? If you drive close to 75 miles, but don’t go over, then maybe. If you only drive a few miles, you’re paying too much. Get ready to show a receipt. \n• Refuel it yourself: You return the car with a full tank. \nIs it worth it? If you have time and there’s a gas station near the rental location, this is almost always the best option. Keep your receipt. \nChristopher Elliott is a consumer advocate and editor at large for National Geographic Traveler. Contact him at chris@elliott.org or visit elliott.org .
