According to the Natural Resources Defense Council , 40 percent of the food produced each year goes to waste in the U.S., which is enough to fill 730 football stadiums.\nRelated Link John Oliver will make you think twice about building new stadiums in Boston (or anywhere) “Food waste is like the band Rascal Flatts,” Oliver said. “It can fill a surprising number of stadiums, even though many people consider it complete garbage.”\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below The large amount of food waste is made even more appalling by the fact that nearly 50 million people in the U.S. live in “food insecure households,” meaning there are a ton of hungry people out there who could have used those meals. Oliver also noted that throwing away so much food is a waste of labor and resources.\n“At a time when the landscape of California is shriveling up like a pumpkin in front of a house with a lazy dad, it seems especially unwise that farmers are pumping water into food that ends up being used as a garnish for landfills,” Oliver said.\nThe comedian snuck in a jab at Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump during the segment as well.\n“If you’re thinking, ‘But hold on, John, what if I’m an asshole who couldn’t give a shit about America’s hungry families or the long-term viability of life on earth?’” Oliver said. “Well, first let me say, ‘Mr. Trump, thank you so much for taking the time to watch this show tonight. It’s lovely to have you with us.’”\nYou can watch the video above.\nFamous Boston-area comedians\n Canton-born comic Bill Burr owns the record for most consecutive sold-out shows at the Wilbur Theatre.
