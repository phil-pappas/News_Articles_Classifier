Victorians introduced the fish to the dark waters of the loch to provide sport. \n\"I have to be honest. I just don't think that Nessie is a prehistoric monster,\" Feltham was quoted as saying. \"What a lot of people have reported seeing would fit in with the description of the catfish with its long curved back.\" \nHis conclusions are unlikely to deter the thousands of tourists who visit the site and believe a monster does still lurk in the dark waters of the deep Scottish lake. \nThe first written record of the monster relates to the Irish monk St Columba, who is fabled to have banished a \"water beast\" to the depths of the River Ness in the sixth century, long before the introduction of the catfish to the loch. \nThere have been countless fruitless attempts to track down the monster in the years since. In 2003, the BBC funded an extensive scientific search that used 600 sonar beams and satellite tracking to sweep the full length of the loch. It concluded there was probably nothing there. \nThe most famous picture of \"Nessie\", known as the \"surgeon's photo\", was taken in 1934 and showed a head popping out of the water. It was revealed 60 years later to be a hoax that used a sea monster model attached to a toy submarine. \n\"The monster mystery will last for ever and will continue to attract people here, monster or not,\" Feltham said. \"I certainly don't regret the last 24 years.\" Top spots to see mythical creatures Previous Next \nOgopogo, the lake monster living in British Columbia's Lake Okanagan, has been spotted by many and even captured on video tape.

Hunters continue to search the Loch in hopes of finding concrete evidence of Nessie. \nIf you'd like to spot a Chupacabra, or Goat Sucker, head to Central and South America.
