This year, Jetsetter has recognized hotels that deliver outstanding experiences that are truly above the rest. The winners represent the top 1% of hotels on Jetsetter.com in 23 ‘best’ categories ranging from Boutique to All-Inclusive and Best Far Flung Escape. Soneva Kiri is the only hotel in South East Asia to receive one of the 23 ‘best’ category rankings. \nIn selecting Soneva Kiri for the ‘Best Far Flung Escape’, the Jetsetter team wrote: “This tiny Thai isle is a private jet and speedboat ride away from the nearest international airport, but the 35-villa Soneva Kiri makes distant memories of Bangkok’s baggage claim. All 35 villas have personal infinity pools, private buggies for cruising the resort grounds, outdoor bathrooms and organic linens. Dedicated concierges (called Fridays, per Robinson Crusoe) meet guests’ every whim, be it arranging a private screening at the beachside Cinema Paradiso, underwater shiatsu at the Six Senses spa, or treetop private dining with a ziplining waiter.” \nJetsetter.com Editor-in-Chief Sean Murphy says, “All of the hotels on Jetsetter are special in some way, but in order to celebrate those properties that go above and beyond, we created the Best-of-the-Best Awards. At Jetsetter we understand that travel choices are personal. The award categories reflect the variety of things our members’ value in a hotel.” \nIn selecting the winners, the Jetsetter editorial team and more than 200 of its global travel correspondents compiled their suggestions along with those from the rest of the Jetsetter team. A final committee of senior-level editors then debated and narrowed down the list based on each category’s criteria, selecting one winner and two runner-ups in each category. All of the hotels on the final list encapsulate the exceptional experiences Jetsetter members have come to expect from properties on the site. \nAward-winning luxury resort Soneva Kiri is located on Thailand’s fourth largest but least populated island, Koh Kood; just one hour by private plane from Bangkok. The resort comprises 36 vast pool villas, ranging in size from one to six bedrooms, all of which are nestled amidst lush tropical rainforest with spectacular ocean views. Highlights of the resort include an open-air Cinema Paradiso, an observatory, a giant moulded bamboo playground for children shaped like a manta ray, and the spectacular treetop Dining Pod.
