Guests were treated to a private tour of the timelessly elegant State Apartments at Kensington Palace, with the added opportunity of hearing from one of the palace’s expert curators and seeing some unique items from the Royal Ceremonial Dress Collection not currently on public display at the palace. \nFor centuries, Kensington Palace has been the backdrop for spectacular social occasions, the scene of private gatherings and a place for cementing royal business. The exclusive breakfast tour gave invited guests the opportunity to discover the secrets and enchanting stories of the palace before it opened to the public for the day. Before embarking on the tour, guests enjoyed pastries and Prosecco in The Orangery, a light and inspiring space which can accommodate receptions of up to 570 guests when using the terrace and marquees. Queen Anne intended the palatial venue to be a greenhouse for her orange trees in winter, but it was frequently used as a party venue for balls and celebrations. Erica Rees-Werder, Events and Operations Manager at Kensington Palace and Kew Palace, said: “We were delighted to welcome guests to experience a private tour of Kensington Palace. The breakfast tours are a perfect opportunity for guests to enjoy breakfast in our beautiful Orangery and enjoy an exclusive visit to the palace before it opens to the public.” The event was organised in conjunction with the Meetings Show and in partnership with London & Partners. Private tours of Kensington Palace are possible year round from 8-10am in the morning and 6-8pm in the evening, subject to availability. Tours must be booked in advance through Historic Royal Palaces’ Functions & Events team. Historic Royal Palaces is an independent charity that also looks after the Tower of London, Banqueting House, Hampton Court Palace, Kew Palace and Hillsborough Castle in Northern Ireland. All money that is earned through private and corporate events is reinvested into the long term future of the palaces and their grounds.
