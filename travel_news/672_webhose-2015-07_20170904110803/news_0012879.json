Hotels - Airlines - CVBs - Destinations - people Welcome International Coalition of Tourism Partners Himalayan chapter ICTP launched its first chapter in Nepal and already made global headlines Adv: \nJul 04, 2015 Adv: \nHawaii- Brussels- Seychelles: The International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) is proud to announce the launch of its first official chapter. Led by Chapter President Mr. Pankaj Pradhananga of Four Season Travel & Tours in Nepal’s capital of Kathmandu, the formation of the Himalayan Chapter of ICTP is an important step in both ICTP’s development, as well as for Nepal and its tourism industry. \nIn a recent article on eTurboNews (eTN) about how Nepal is rebuilding after two devastating earthquakes that took place on April 25 and May 12, 2015, four tourism stakeholders in Nepal took it upon themselves to take a step towards positive movement for the country’s tourism industry. The Radisson Hotel Kathmandu, Four Seasons Travel, and a Nepalese student group called Passion to Travel, put together a travel journey for disabled tourists visiting the Kathmandu Valley. \nInteracting with these local hosts, stakeholders, and Nepal hospitality and tourism industry students, this tour was a demonstration of support for each other and a public demonstration that tourism in Nepal is ready to move, produce, and welcome the world. \n“We proudly support accessible/inclusive tourism, and our Radisson Hotel Kathmandu is certainly leading the way in this regard,” said Thorsten Kirschke, President, Carlson Rezidor, Asia Pacific. “There is no doubt this is a difficult time in Nepal, but it truly shows the ‘Yes I Can! hospitality’ of our hotel staff to assist with important initiatives like this led by a great partner in the ICTP.” \nThe Himalayan Chapter of ICTP will hold its first meeting next month in July. It is the goal of the chapter to focus on training and capacity building for human resources in tourism in the Himalayan region. Ideas include the development of a short-term program to begin with in order to fill the immediate need, followed by a diploma in the long-term, based on the future needs of the industry. \neTN Chairman Juergen T Steinmetz said: \"Nepal is a special place to put our first chapter in place. Together with our new Himalayan founding members we're proud to play a role in helping Nepal's tourism industry during difficult times. Pankaj Pradhananga had put this group of senior leaders in the Nepal tourism industry together and already made global headlines for ICTP Nepal\" \nThe founding members of the ICTP Himalayan Chapter are: \nMr. Pankaj Pradhananga – Four Season Travel & Tours, Kathmandu Mr. Binod Rai – Insight Himalaya Treks, Nepal Mr. Sunil Shrestha - Travel House International, Nepal Mr. Sukendra Gurbacharya – Nepal & Beyond Travel & Tours, Nepal Ms. Nima Shrestha – The Inn, Boutique Guesthouse, Nepal Mr. Basant Bajracharya – Basant Adventure, Tibet & Nepal Mr. Deepak Gupta – Heat Flexi Tours, Darjeeling, India Mr. Nawang Sherpa – Mountain Journey Tours & Trek, Bhutan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T13:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T18:21:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
