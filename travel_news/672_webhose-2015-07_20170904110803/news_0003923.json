The national carrier of the Sultanate of Oman is now accepting applications from graduates with no prior flight training, as well as those who already have experience.\nOnce accepted, Omani citizens with no prior flying experience or qualification will be enrolled in the Cadet Pilot training programme, the study cost of which will be covered 100% by Oman Air. They will undergo their initial flight training in an Approved Training Organization selected by the airline, followed by a type rated course on successful completion of their initial flight training.\nSuccessful applicants who have funded their own flight training prior to approaching Oman Air are known as Ab Initio Pilots: Licensed Pilots with no previous airline experience and/or Type Rating. They will be enrolled as second officers on a Type Rating course in one of the Airlines narrow body aircraft after, depending on company requirements.\nCaptain Moosa Al Shidhani, Acting Chief Officer Flight Operations at Oman Air, commented:\n“Oman Air is delighted to be expanding its pilot recruitment programme and giving more Omani men and women the opportunity to develop a career in civil aviation. This step builds on our continuing recruitment programme, which has resulted in a huge number of applications being received by Oman Air. It also reaffirms our commitment, as our country’s proud national carrier, to actively supporting the Government in its work to increase employment and career opportunities for the people of the Sultanate.\n“As Oman Air continues its ambitious programme of fleet and network expansion, we look forward to welcoming many more Omani Cadet Pilots and Ab Initio Pilots to the company. Together, we will help to ensure that every customer enjoys Oman Air’s award-winning products and services aboard one of the most comfortable, reliable and youngest fleets in the skies.”\nApplicants for Cadet Pilot positions should be Omani nationals aged between 17 and 26 years old, as of 31st December. Those who apply following school must have achieved a minimum average grade of 80% in Secondary school diploma with a minimum of 80% in English, mathematics and physics. Those who apply after graduation from college or university must also have achieved a minimum of IELTS (Academic) 5.5 band and 3 GPA in the Science Stream.\nAb Initio Pilot candidates should be Omani citizens aged under 36 years old. Their academic qualifications must include a minimum average grade of 60% in Secondary school diploma with a minimum of 60% in English, mathematics and physics. Furthermore, they should have achieved a minimum of Level 4 ICAO English language proficiency, and have at least 200 hours flight time, including 100 hours solo.\nIn addition, Ab Initio Pilot candidates should note that Oman Air will only accept EASA CPL/IR with EASA Frozen ATPL for candidates who start their flight training on or after 01 SEP 2015.\nIn addition to demonstrating the necessary educational requirements, applicants for both categories of pilot will be required to pass a predetermined assessment process set out by an Approved Training Organization.\nThe aim of the process is to assess pilots in each category and ensure that they meet Oman Air’s high standards. It confirms that every pilot entering Oman Air’s training programme possesses the requisite knowledge, skills and capabilities to achieve a successful outcome in the proposed training. It also establishes whether an applicant possesses the personality and attitudes necessary to successfully operate as a flying crewmember. In addition, the process assists in minimizing the risk of training failures, both during initial training and the pilot’s subsequent career with Oman Air. Furthermore, it helps to protect and enhance the safety and efficiency of Oman Air’s Flight Operations, by ensuring that the quality of pilots joining the company meets the applicable standards set by the air transport industry.\nRecognising that human factors play a critical role in the safe operation of modern, highly-automated aircraft, a key element of the pilot selection process is a psychometric assessment. This establishes that the personality and attitudes of each applicant are appropriate for a safe operation.\nRecruitment in advance of the start of individual training programs will be announced in the local media, as will documentary requirements and entry criteria. Prospective candidates will be invited to apply at that time.\nSource:- Oman Air\nTags: Oman Air Expands Omani Pilot , Oman Air News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T22:11:47.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
