Photos by Arthur Jones Dionio - + Myanmar's southern city of Dawei is only 150km away from the Thai border checkpoint at Kanchanaburi's Ban Phu Nam Ron, but travelling to the city requires a considerable amount of time and endurance. \nWe started our journey in the early morning. At Ban Phu Nam Ron checkpoint, there are only two immigration counters, so the queues were long. Most of the people were migrant factory workers from neighbouring countries who needed to cross the border to extend their visas. \nAfter one-and-a-half hours, we passed Thailand's immigration checkpoint. Sor, a man from Myanmar, showed up with his red sedan as part of the van service to Dawei we had booked at a tour agent office located at the checkpoint area. Once in his car, he turned the stereo on and Thai rock band Carabao blared out. \n\"I like Carabao very much,\" he said in fluent Thai, before singing along with a number of songs. Sor's role is a co-ordinator of the tour agency, so he drives passengers to a public van station at Htee Khee village, about 5km away from the Thai border. \nThai soldiers also have a checkpoint at the border. We rolled down the windows and got a nod from the soldiers to go ahead. \nAfter we arrived at Htee Khee village, Sor told us to wait at one food stall next to the public van. Since tourism in Dawei is still in its infancy, there is no timetable for the van service. Each van leaves the station when the driver picks up enough passengers to cover the cost of petrol. \nOur driver couldn't speak English, nor Thai. So, Sor acted as translator and told the driver to send us to our booked hotel. He then turned to me and asked if I'd like to exchange money. \n\"I have a good market rate for kyat,\" he said and told us to wait. \"We need at least two more passengers before departing,\" he added. \nAfter two hours of waiting, the driver finally had four passengers. He gestured to us to get into the van. Meanwhile, he had changed from his traditional costume of longyi into jeans, and spat out his betel nuts. \nWhen he started the engine, it roared loudly â€” his van perhaps more than a decade old. Inside, the passenger seats were hard and couldn't be adjusted. There were only two rows of passenger seats instead of three. \nThe reason for this was that the driver wanted to fit more Myanmar passengers in for the return leg. A Thai passenger who had opened an office in Dawei told me that she once sat in a van that carried 18, despite the van's capacity being just 10. \nThe back space normally reserved for luggage was replaced with five small plastic chairs and the space behind the driver was changed to a temporary passenger row. \nPassengers were packed like canned fish, she said, and assured me that I would have a chance to experience it for my return trip. \nThe dirt road connecting Dawei and Ban Phu Nam Ron is still new, but very bumpy and has not yet been completed. If you look for the road in Google maps, you will find jungles instead of highways. \nThis dirt road has been built by Italian-Thai Development Company after it received the green light from the Karen National Union in 2012. The purpose was to link Dawei Special Economic Zone to Thailand. The road shortens the previous route by a quarter. \nThe road condition is not very good though and our van couldn't go much faster than 40km. Once, the van was stopped by construction workers. Ahead of us were excavators and front loaders digging out red soil while bulldozers tried to flatten the road surface. \nOne passenger from Myanmar who could speak Thai told us that the construction workers had tried to lower the height as this part of the hilly road was too steep. \nThe winding road runs along the Great Tenasserim River. From time to time, we spotted people standing in the river panning for gold. \nAfter driving for three hours, the van made a bathroom stop at one restaurant along the road. The restaurant owner was ready to take any order for those who were hungry. I looked around and noticed a lot of insects in the air, but it seemed like the locals did not care much about the bugs, as they were everywhere; on food and tables. \nTwo hours later we arrived at Dawei. The total ride was about five hours and the whole journey from the city of Kanchanaburi took us about 10 hours. Fortunately, we checked in at our hotel before sunset. We booked a motorised tricycle for the next day with the hotel. \nLuckily, the tricycle driver Thein Htaik, or Sam, was a member of the Union of Myanmar Travel Association and could speak English very well. We asked him to show us the town highlights and the way of life of the people. \nHe brought us to many places, including temples and local handicraft shops. We experienced how people made brooms, cheroot and clay pottery and produced cashew snacks and carved wood pieces (see pictures). \nSam said he wanted to see more tourism development in Dawei in terms of professional guides and tour services, while the Golden Guest hotel owner whom I talked to also looked to the hospitality service in Thailand as a role model. \nThere are not yet many foreigners in Dawei. The town is sleepy and peaceful, especially when it rains. After the Dawei Special Economic Zone is completed in the future, however, Dawei will change a lot. At the very least, the road will be much improved, noted Sam. \nAlong the road to Dawei, a mahout rides his elephant in an area still controlled by the Karen National Union. \nBesides Buddhists, there are also Christian and Islamic communities in Dawei. \nThe most sacred site in Dawei is Shwe Taung Zar Pagoda. Before walking inside the temple compound, all visitors are required to take off their shoes. The prayer hall houses the principle sitting Buddha image. To the front right of the image is a life-size standing sculpture believed to be an angel who is an eyewitness of people making merit, according to local guide Sam. He said the old belief began because after people donated money to the temple, they had to touch the sculpture so the angel would record the merit. But, over time, the belief changed. \"People believe angels can cure sickness, so they make merit and then touch the sculpture at the part they want it to be cured such as eyes, hands, shoulder, back or feet,\" he added. \nCashew nut is one of Dawei's main exports. One of the major producers is MMT Cashews located on Alel Road in Khone Win Dat Quarter. The dim shophouse is open for visitors to see how they turn the raw cashew nuts into edible snacks. Starting from boiling cashew seeds in two large pans, the team of female workers crack the shells open with a tool and take out the white nuts. Another team will clean all the remaining brown pulp after the seeds are dried and package them in a box ready for export to countries like China, Malaysia and also Thailand. \nA worker for Italthai operates an excavator to refill land not far from a coastal area to build a road linking the planned two deep sea ports. At present, there is no concrete structure at the project site marked as Dawei Special Economic Zone, except the office of Italthai and its accommodation, which looks like a five-star resort. It took about one hour and 40 minutes on a motorised tricycle ride from the city of Dawei to the location. Along the way, you can make a stop at Maungmagan beach and hot springs. \nWithout a local guide, you would probably never know the building next to a public park is a broom factory. Not every process of making a broom requires heavy machinery. Workers, all of them female, can even work when the lights are out. The first stage is to group dried weed flowers into small bunches and another team ties seven little bunches in to a broom. The last process is to secure the handle. The way Dawei locals make the broom is not that different to people in Thailand, but observing them patiently and quietly working from the first to last process is well worth a visit. One broom costs just 500 kyatt (about 15 baht). \nThis small pottery is located in an alley off Niban Road. The ground floor of the elevated wooden house is busy with workers. All of them are female except the owner who is an expert in arranging and piling up the pottery above the stove. Each worker is skilful. They can turn a handful of kneaded clay into a vase within a minute. It took about three hours before the clay jars turn to red and are ready for sale. \nOn the second floor of a hardware store is a working area for craftsmen. They work on carving windows, doors and home decorations with numerous designs. \nA group of women sit crossed-leg behind wooden tables. They quietly work on making cheroot. Starting from rolling a piece of dried Cordia myxa leaf over a filter made of dried corn husk, they fill it up with crushed tobacco. There are also choices of other dried leaves such as tobacco and betel leaf. Myanmar people like cheroot because of the smell and how all ingredients are natural, said the guide. The price is also cheap, he said, adding that one can buy five cheroots for the same price as one cigarette.   17 people liked / 1  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T23:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T17:22:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
