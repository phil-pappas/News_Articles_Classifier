BATH — Steuben County Manager Jack Wheeler announced Monday that the face of local tourism is changing, but that announcement is soliciting mixed reactions from local leaders. At Monday’s meeting of the County Legislature, the Steuben County Conference Visitors Bureau (SCCVB) announced that it was dropping the name Steuben County from its tourism campaign in favor of “Corning and the Southern Finger Lakes,” a moniker that some feel leaves out the sections of the county. The SCCVB is an independent organization established by the county and funded by local tax dollars. The organization’s Executive Director Peggy Coleman gave the re-branding presentation. “We really are unique in the 14-county Finger Lakes Region,” Coleman said Monday. “We need to build on that.” In the last year, the SCCVB hired a consulting firm to help research different re-branding strategies. “They took a look at what the brand of the Conference of Visitors Bureau should be, and determined that Corning and the Southern Finger Lakes in terms of internet and Google searches were what was meaningful to folks from out of the area,” Wheeler told The Evening Tribune Tuesday. The branding was embraced by the county legislature, and faced no objection. “If that’s the branding that works to get people in the door, that’s perfectly fine,” Wheeler said. The county manager is confident that secondary efforts to promote the rest of the county are adequate. “The logo and branding recognize other areas of the county that help support tourism and development,” he said. “While it does say Corning and the Southern Finger Lakes, Peggy Coleman did note in her presentation, and members of the board emphasized it as well, that that doesn’t mean that it’s not the rest of Steuben County,” the county manager noted. Wheeler promised that promotional materials would also reflect the importance of other areas of the county including Hornell. In the promotional materials, the “O” in Corning will be interchangeable, using different logos to highlight what’s going on in other regions of the county. “Right now a bunch of grapes and sailboat are being used to highlight what’s going on in the Keuka Lake area,” Wheeler said. While well received by the legislature, the new strategy has garnered mixed reactions in the Hornell area. “It’s been a bone of contention for a long time, that a lot of attention has been concentrated in the eastern part of the county,” said Hornell Area Chamber of Commerce President James W. Griffin. Page 2 of 2 - Hornell is the home to some marquee events including the area’s largest St. Patrick’s Day celebration, the biggest fourth of July fireworks display outside of Corning, the Gus Macker basketball tournament and a number of historically relevant sites, and the same is true of other areas of the county. “It bothers me to a point that they have really disregarded Hornell over the years,” Griffin said. “They focus on travelers from the east, but tourism also comes from the west, and Hornell should be their first stop.” Griffin also realized that Corning is a well branded city with a number of attractions, and the added value of the Finger Lakes. “Hornell is really a gateway to the Finger Lakes, and we use it in our promotional materials,” he said. He also accepts the decision of the board, which the chamber of commerce has representatives on. However, if you visit the SCCVB website, corningfingerlakes.com there are no mentions of Steuben County or attractions east of Bath on its homepage. A map of the county’s attractions lists the Hornell area as having “Rural Back Roads and Scenic Byways,” whereas Corning is labeled “Arts and Culture;” Bath-Hammondsport as “Wine Country”; and the Southwestern Part of the county as “Outdoor Adventure.” The map notes camping sites in Arkport and at Kanakadea Park, golfing at Twin Hickory Golf Club and a farmers’ market, but shows no historical sites, beer and wine-making or parks and outdoor recreation. Hornell Mayor Shawn D. Hogan agreed, that the strategy was Corning and Keuka Lake centered, and feared the plan could potentially under-serve much of the county. This obviously wasn’t the first time the mayor has taken exception to the county’s advertising strategy. “Welcome to our world,” he said. “They’ve been doing that forever.” Hogan had not yet heard of the announcement, but said, “(If true), I don’t think it’s appropriate to leave out any place in the county.” Giving county leaders the benefit of doubt, he said, “Obviously Corning has internationally acclaimed glass museum, which is understandable, but I don’t think they would intentionally leave off an area.” The Mayor said he would be in touch with Wheeler to begin a dialogue about the direction of tourism promotion and the city’s place in it. Multiple phone calls to Steuben County Conference Visitors Bureau Executive Director Coleman for additional comment were not returned by the time of reporting.
