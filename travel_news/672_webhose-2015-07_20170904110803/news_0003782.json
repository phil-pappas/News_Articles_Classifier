The hotel brand will be going into a new… more La Quinta Inns & Suites has chosen Morgan Hill to roll out its first next-generation prototype hotel in California. The 104-unit, four-story hotel at Highway 101 and E. Dunne Avenue is now under construction and will adhere to the brand's new \"Del Sol\" concept, which features a sleeker design for travelers and streamlined efficiencies for owners. \"It really is an upgrade from our prior prototype,\" said Alan Bowles II , director of development for La Quinta in California. \"It’s just a better-looking, more efficient, four-story building. It has a really sexy exterior and then a great sense of arrival with a great room. That's what the public wants.\" The project is being developed by Stonepark Capital, the investment group headed by Andrew Firestone and Jess Parker that The Business Journal first profiled in January . The hotel brand name had not yet been announced at that time. \"I think this particular evolution of the product is really handsome,\" Firestone told me. \"We’ve looked at (the first Del Sol concept built) in College Station, Texas, and it’s a cool looking building. I think for travelers coming to the South Bay, it’s a good fit there. It looks cool, modern, and it’s really efficient in terms of how it operates. Guest will never see some of that, but the working mechanics of the hotel have been really thought through.\" The property is \"limited service,\" meaning it does not have its own restaurant or bar. But it does provide a substantial breakfast service, a grab-and-go food option called Brightside Market and offers 1,000 square feet of meeting space. Competitors in this space include Fairfield Inn & Suites, Holiday Inn Express and Hampton Inn. But La Quinta says the Del Sol concept is more profitable than those brands because of small tweaks to the building and operations, such as a chute on each floor for laundry. (Trade publication Hotel Management has a good overview, here .) Bowles said La Quinta is bullish on Morgan Hill. \"It's the path of growth for Silicon Valley, you have the wineries and the city is very proactive in trying to promote Morgan Hill,\" he said. The project comes amid a boom in hospitality development across Silicon Valley, spurred by record room prices. Just last week, I wrote about T2 Hospitality laying the groundwork for two AC Hotel properties — a hip select-service imprint of Marriott — in Sunnyvale. Bowles himself noted that he paid $249 for a Wednesday-night stay at the Holiday Inn Express & Suites when he was in town for the La Quinta groundbreaking. \"Everything else was sold out,\" he said. The Morgan Hill La Quinta should be completed in the first quarter of 2016, Bowles said, adding that he hopes to have everything ready in time for Super Bowl 50 on Feb. 7. \"We're going to give it out best effort,\" he said. \nWant San Jose Travel   Home of the Day", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T00:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T00:29:48.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
