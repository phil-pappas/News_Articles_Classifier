Each train is 110 metres long and is made up of five cars, each equipped with three large doors on either side to facilitate passenger exchange in the stations. Its highly efficient electrical braking system reduces the energy consumption of the trains. A Wi-Fi link between the train and the ground ensures the transmission of the train’s operational parameters, thus anticipating maintenance operations and guaranteeing a reliable service.\nThe MI09 trains are designed and produced in France on the industrial sites of Alstom in Valenciennes Petite-Forêt and Bombardier in Crespin. The five other French Alstom Transport sites involved are Ornans for the traction motors, Le Creusot for the bogies, Tarbes for the traction chain equipment, Petit Quevilly for the main transformer and Villeurbanne for the passenger information and electronic control systems.\nLine A of the Paris RER2 transports 1.2 million passengers a day, which makes it the most heavily frequented regional line in Europe. The MI09 trains currently in service on the line have already covered over 24 million kilometres.\nSource:- Alstom\nRelated Posts Energy recovery for metro trains and suburban trains is gathering speed Siemens to realign regional organization and strengthen corporate units Expanded Train Services From Decmber 2013 – Scot Rail Bombardier to Supply 19 Additional Francilien Commuter Trains to Île-de-France Transport Authority (STIF) and French National Railway Company (SNCF) Bombardier to Deliver New Train Fleet for Gatwick Express Services", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T14:03:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
