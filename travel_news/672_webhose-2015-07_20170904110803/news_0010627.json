Camden School for Girls has told parents it will introduce a new “admission fee” of between £50 and £100 in return for help with Ucas forms for gap-year students. According to a report in the Camden New Journal, pupils in the sixth form have been told they must make cheques payable to the school’s finance department. The service, which has been free in the past, includes teachers checking the pupils’ forms for “accuracy” and providing an official “confirmation of qualifications”. It is understood the school has had to start charging parents because of recent cuts from the Government to state schools . One mother with a child in the sixth form told the local newspaper: “I and other parents are outraged. I’ve never heard of any other state school that says they will only provide a reference if paid a fee. The school says it’s for administration, but it’s a huge disincentive to applying for university. “The school should be bending over backwards to help children get to university, not charging them to do so.” Founded in 1871, the school is regarded as one of the top state schools due to its reputation for academic excellence and for sending a large share of its pupils to top British universities.
