There has been no discussion of what should be done to avoid the slow, insidious decline into dysfunction.\nWe noted this in our presentation to the appropriation committee two weeks ago — if Eskom were truly a business, its shareholders would ask what it intended to do to get out of the mess. Instead, there has been an awful silence, as if going bankrupt is something to be faced with stoicism.\nWe identified a prime cause of the problem as being a disturbed cash flow resulting from political demands being made on something that should be governed by economics, not politics.\nIn 1999, there was the political decision to forbid Eskom from building the next big coal-fired power station. This was somewhat irrational, because Eskom had the experience and the skills to build power stations and bring them online within budget and on time. It demonstrated this as it completed the Majuba Power Station.\nEvery year for six years, a new unit came on line on April 1. Medupi and Kusile have clearly shown that experience and those skills are critically important for building power stations.\nRecently, it was decided to require Eskom to buy coal from small, black-owned coal mines at a cost of more than R450 a tonne, when the going rate from the large mines is less than R200 a tonne. There is nothing wrong with providing a subsidy to achieve socially desirable ends, but there is everything wrong in hiding that subsidy in a public enterprise.\nEskom has squeaked about the cost of coal, government has thundered about the need to stop exports, and then remembered coal exports are now one of the things that keep the economy afloat.\nThere are several other examples of political decisions that have contributed to the destruction of what was once a thriving and efficient business.\nWe are not criticising the political decisions as such — SA is a democracy and we all have to live with our political decisions. Our concern is that government has seen fit to load the costs of these decisions onto Eskom. Because it has a huge cash flow, it was able to carry the costs for just so long. Now the back of the camel is broken.\nThis is why we have thought long and hard about how to restore Eskom to functionality. We believe the solution is to identify the parts of the business that should be in open competition and excise them so that, when called on to perform a political function, that function can be properly costed and seen as a subsidy.\nIt would be simple to create an electricity supply company, responsible for generation of electricity as a national asset. Called Esco, it would be in open competition with the renewable energy generators and the new breed of co-generators that the Department of Energy is fostering.\nEsco would hold the present-generation facilities of Eskom and could build new facilities using the sort of financing model employed with such success in the department’s renewable energy programme.\nThat programme has raised nearly R200bn against nothing more than long-term power purchase agreements, which will bring us of the order of eight terawatt-hours (TWh) of electrons annually. The R200bn could bring us 20%-50% of the nuclear power programme, which would yield 15TWh-40TWh. Equally, it would be simple to create a company to distribute electricity. It would be called Edco and would be in competition with municipalities and others who enter the market. As Eskom distributes about half of SA’s power, Edco could readily be set up and have a significant cash flow and a strong asset base.\nIt would need government support to enforce collection but, once achieved, the business would be self-sustaining and could yield a reasonable dividend.\nThere remains the question of how to get the electrons from the generators to the distributors. We have a national highway that performs this duty. One of the problems is that it is not cost-reflective — it does not matter how far the electrons have to travel, or what the losses are along the way, the cost of transport is nominally the same.\nThere is no apparent cash flow to create a business. The transmission grid is a huge asset, but it needs to expand. Funding the expansion has been a direct charge on the national purse. We believe that this, fundamentally, is the reason Parliament has struggled for nearly a decade to create an independent system and market operator.\nEskom already performs all the functions of such an operator.\nWe envisage the creation of an electricity transmission commission, Etcom, to buy electricity from Esco and other generators and to sell to Edco, municipalities and any other distributors.\nInitially, Etcom would take over the transmission assets of Eskom. Its capital requirements would remain largely a charge on the fiscus. However, it would need to develop a model for the costing of power transmission. Electricity should cost less in eMalahleni, next to the power stations, than in Johannesburg.\nEtcom would initially be a commission, funded from the fiscus. As its economic model evolved, it might be possible to allow competition. For example, the Esco generation unit called Koeberg might contract directly with the City of Cape Town for the provision of power down the city’s own transmission line. The city would pay less than for the power it bought from Etcom, which in turn had transported the power from Mpumalanga. As competition emerged, Etcom could slowly morph into a company in its own right.\nNersa would have a major role in regulating this process as it develops. Nersa operates in a morass, particularly with power transmission not being cost reflective.\nTrying to price power requires the annual production of a 200-page report. We can foresee it growing its role to the point at which licensing new generation facilities or new entrants to the distribution market become more important than the task of trying to cost electricity nationally. It would be far simpler to monitor the costs of the production of power with an identifiable business, Esco. With Edco pricing distribution, it would be far simpler to bring under control those municipalities that are overcharging to balance their books.\nWe need a way forward to ensure that Eskom survives. The national investment in refinancing must not become a case of throwing good money after bad. Our model may not be perfect, but we believe it to be rational and to provide an essential element in a debate that is not being held.\n• Lloyd is professor at the Energy Institute at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology and a member of the Ministerial Advisory Council on Energy.
