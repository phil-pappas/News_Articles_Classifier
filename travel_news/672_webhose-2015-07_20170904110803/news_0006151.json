The juxtaposition of the elegant physical discipline and the natural surroundings in which the demonstration took place created a beautiful and captivating scene. \nWolong Valley, a visually momentous valley south of the Yangtze River, is known for its magnificence, elegance, steepness of the surrounding slopes and sense of awe that is inspired in all visitors. Surrounded by towering mountains, the air of the valley is rich in negative oxygen ions as a result of a forest coverage rate of 90.7 percent. Yoga, which reduces stress and helps practitioners concentrate their energy in positive ways, combined with Wolong Valley's natural \"oxygen bar,\" helps to alleviate physical and mental fatigue. As a result, Wolong Valley has attracted a large number of yoga practitioners seeking for a great locale for the discipline's breathing exercises. \nWolong Valley, located in the northern part of Wuyuan County, is a national 4A-Level Scenic Area (as per the China National Tourism Administration's widely recognized rating system for Chinese tourism destinations). The approx. 10-km hiking trail has a natural drop height of 730 meters. \nThe valley is blessed with several spectacular waterfalls including the Water Curtain Waterfall, the White Dragon Waterfall, the Green Dragon Waterfall and the Big Dragon Waterfall. \nBig Dragon is considered to be the most spectacular among them. \nIn the past few years, Jiangxi Wuyuan Tourism Co., Ltd. has been staging promotional events to increase awareness of the Wolong Valley scenic area as an ideal destination for interested travelers and vacationers. The combination of the wide availability of outdoor sports, the natural beauty of the physical surroundings and the traditional culture of the Wuyuan region make it an ideal spot for a vacation or getaway.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T23:57:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
