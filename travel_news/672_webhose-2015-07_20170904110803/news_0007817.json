Along the way I’d been severely scolded by more than one chattering red grouse, and ignored by innumerable flocks of grazing sheep. Eventually I’d made it all the way to Top Withens, a ruined farmhouse whose setting was said to have been the inspiration for Emily Brontë’s “Wuthering Heights.” Sunburned and tired after the long walk, I needed refreshment. I found it in the Fleece, an old pub in the Brontës’ Yorkshire hometown, Haworth: a half-pint (9.6 ounces) of Golden Best, a mild ale from the local brewer Timothy Taylor. Served with almost no carbonation from a traditional hand pump, the beer was refreshingly bitter and just sweet enough to renew my energy. Better still, the small portion and the beer’s relatively low alcohol — just 3.5 percent — meant that I could sample it again, or try any one of several delicious alternatives.

In addition to traditional English ales, the county is also home to up-and-coming craft breweries that produce more modern styles, as well as some of Britain’s ’s most beloved pubs and bars. Armed with Mr. Linley’s book, I decided to take a six-day trip across much of West, South and North Yorkshire this spring, and soak up a sense of this northern English county and its renowned beer culture. I’d found Haworth almost impossibly pretty, both in my walks on the surrounding moors and in the village itself. Like much of the area, it has quieted down since its Victorian-era heyday, when textile mills flourished in Yorkshire. Since then, Haworth has become a storybook vacation destination, best known for its connection to the Brontës, its old stone cottages and pubs like the Fleece.

I enjoyed my half of Boltmaker, a bitter ale carrying the pub’s name, though, unlike at other taverns in the region, the locals didn’t seem very friendly. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Back at the station, I boarded another train for a quick ride to the Victorian town of Saltaire, where the spacious stone halls of the town’s disused textile mill housed a huge exhibit dedicated to the Yorkshire-born painter David Hockney. After an afternoon with the art and some downtime on the lawn of Saltaire’s sprawling park — originally built for the health and well-being of the mill workers — I was ready for a more urbane setting. Another short ride took me to Leeds, where I met up with Mr. Linley, who walked with me to a few of his favorite pubs and offered advice on what to see in his city over the next few days. What I found turned out to be one of the best beer-drinking destinations I’d visited in Europe, a friendly and undertouristed city of about 750,000 inhabitants — large enough to be interesting, though still walkable. Moreover, the local beer scene has exploded. With Mr. Linley, I visited a new brewpub, Tapped, with over two dozen modern craft beers, and the recently rejuvenated Whitelock’s, which calls itself the oldest pub in Leeds, celebrating its 300th anniversary this year.

Just around the corner, I found another new craft beer bar, Bundobust, which eschews meat entirely, instead offering craft brews with a menu of vegetarian Indian street food. Sipping a half of Bundobust’s house brew, a coriander-infused Pilsner, I found myself wishing that more pubs served spicy okra fries and onion bhaji with tangy tamarind chutney as bar snacks. My two days in Leeds included a number of modern taverns and extremely up-to-date craft brews, but I wanted to find out more about Yorkshire’s most traditional breweries, and what it was that made the half-pints of old-style bitter and mild so delicious. Magic Rock’s IPAs were good, but I could hardly tell one from the other, and all of them seemed to be imitations of American beers, while the bitters and milds felt as much a part of the region as the moors and the old textile mills. When I had emailed Timothy Taylor to request a tour, the response came back that they do not offer tours, instead suggesting that I visit the Black Sheep brewery in the remote North Yorkshire village of Masham. And so, after 42 minutes on a high-speed train to the town of Thirsk and a 15-minute taxi ride across beautiful North Yorkshire farmland, I arrived at the Black Sheep brewery just as a tour was beginning. The brewery, I learned, had opened in 1992, when one of the Theakstons had split from the local Theakston brewery, starting a second major beer producer in a town of just over a thousand inhabitants.

Other tourgoers were clearly fans, and a number of guests were drinking and dining in the airy, on-site restaurant. The hourlong tour showed off the historic building — originally part of Lightfoot’s, another local beer producer — where the new Black Sheep brewery had been built. There was also a focus on the unusual fermenting vessels, called Yorkshire squares. Despite the name, most of them were round, roughly the size of a small aboveground swimming pool, with an upper chamber that allowed the fermenting liquid to drain through a hole in its “deck,” or floor, into a second chamber. Every three hours for three days, our guide explained, the fermenting beer in the lower chamber was pumped through a “rouser” onto the upper level for six minutes. The fermenters themselves were open on top, allowing the fruity scent of yeast to fill the room. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The result, I realized, must be why the traditional milds and bitters from Yorkshire tasted so remarkable. Old breweries throughout Europe sing the praises of open fermenters, rather than more modern cylindroconical tanks, but the unusual process of rousing the yeast in Yorkshire squares must cause the strong local flavors. After a lunch of crispy fish and chips with malt vinegar and a half of Golden Sheep, a moderately bitter ale, in the brewery’s bistro, I walked across Masham to the storied Theakston brewery, founded in 1827. Along the way, I peeked into a greengrocer’s, housed in a hobbit-like stone building, and followed the signs to the brewery down a narrow, walled lane. At one point I caught a glimpse of a grand manor, hiding behind a lavish gated entrance. The walk had taken only 10 minutes, but the weather was overcast and chilly, leaving me too cold and tired for another tour. Instead I repaired to the on-site pub, the Black Bull in Heaven, and ordered halves of Theakston beers while warming up next to the fireplace. Theakston’s best bitter and XB were excellent, with more of that yeast aroma I’d noticed at the Black Sheep. But the big surprise was the brewery’s strong ale, Old Peculier, named after the Peculier of Masham, a legal district created by the Archbishop of York in the 12th century. Dark, plummy and mysteriously bitter, with 5.6 percent alcohol it was much stronger than many of the local beers, though still weaker than many American craft brews.

After a night in the beautiful walled city of York and an afternoon in Tadcaster, Samuel Smith’s hometown, I headed down to Sheffield, the South Yorkshire manufacturing city. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T21:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T22:24:19.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
