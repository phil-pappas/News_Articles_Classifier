Softer domestic outcomes are being offset by strong international results. \nAustralia’s reputation as a desirable destination is under pressure. \n“With intense competition for international visitors, we need to work hard to cement Australia’s status as a great destination through consistent and well-funded marketing campaigns,” Ms Osmond said. \n“We also need to address the taxes and charges on tourists which harm Australia’s appeal with international visitors and act as a handbrake on an industry with huge job-creating potential. \n“Tourism has been identified as an industry with the potential to boost our national economy, create jobs and grow prosperity, so it’s important these issues are addressed.” \n\n\nThe TTF-MasterCard Tourism Survey Industry Sentiment Survey is the leading independent measure of key industry themes and trends. The survey is distributed to senior staff within TTF’s membership organisations and other leading tourism businesses around Australia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T11:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T12:43:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
