She declined to comment further, including about which airlines are being investigated. \nThanks to a series of mergers starting in 2008, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United now control more than 80 percent of the seats in the domestic travel market. During that period, they have eliminated unprofitable flights, filled a higher percentage of seats on planes and made a very public effort to slow growth in order to command higher airfares. \nIt worked. The average domestic airfare rose 13 percent from 2009 to 2014, when adjusted for inflation, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. And that doesn't include the billions of dollars airlines collect from new fees: $25 each way to check a bag and $200 to change a domestic reservation. During the past 12 months, the airlines took in $3.6 billion in bag fees and another $3 billion in reservation change fees. \nAll of that has led to record profits for the industry. In the past two years, U.S. airlines earned a combined $19.7 billion. \nThis year could lead to even higher profits thanks to a massive drop in the price airlines pay for jet fuel, their single highest expense. In April, U.S. airlines paid $1.94 a gallon, down 34 percent from the year before. \n__ \nKoenig reported from Dallas, Mayerowitz from New York. \n__ \nDavid Koenig can be reached at http://twitter.com/airlinewriter , Mayerowitz at http://twitter.com/GlobeTrotScott and Tucker at http://twitter.com/etuckerAP . \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T21:49:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
