Our guide features expert recommendations for beach , villa , culture , food and drink and activity holidays. All prices are for property rental for a week in spring or summer unless stated otherwise. They are subject to availability. 1. Villa Nurtan Bozburun Peninsula The rocky but forested Bozburun Peninsula, stretching out into the impossibly blue waters where the Aegean and Mediterranean meet, is one of the most attractive promontories on Turkey’s beautiful south-west coast. Despite its proximity to the “full English” resort of Marmaris, it is remarkably unspoilt, largely because it has been officially designated a nature area by the Turkish government and retains its small communities of farmers and fishermen. The paucity of ancient sites so common in this part of the world means the focus is very much on R&R, admiring views of the Greek islands of Symi and Rhodes anchored offshore, and enjoying traditional village life. The attractive stone-built Villa Nurtan, set on the edge of a friendly hamlet on the north shore of the peninsula, sleeps six, is set in beautiful landscaped gardens and has an eco-friendly pool. From £1,300 (020 3005 2749; luxuryvillasturkey.com ). • Things to see on the Turquoise Coast Villa Nurtan is set on the edge of a friendly hamlet on the north shore of the Bozburun peninsula Photo: Luxury Villas 2. Beykent Villa, Mt Olympos Set on a pine-forested mountainside over 3,000ft above sea level, the small settlement of Beycik is just a half-hour drive from one of Mediterranean Turkey’s finest beaches, Cirali . It also sits astride the fabulous Lycian Way hiking trail, and is a one-day walk (for the fit) from the 7,700ft summit of Mt Olympos. Refreshingly cool even in the scorching mid-summer heat, Beycik is defined by its blanket of pines, the sheer north face of Mt Olympos, and stunning views over a coruscating Mediterranean. The beach-side ancient sites of Phaselis and Olympos are both close by, bustling Antalya only an hour away. The two-bedroom, semi-detached chalet-type Beykent Villa here, owned by Huseyin and Joy, has its own pool, and great mountain and forest views. £420 for two people, £600 for four (0090 5322 130313; huseyin@unal.co.uk). 3. Islamlar, Taurus Mountains Inhabitants of Turkey’s Mediterranean coast have traditionally packed their bags and headed up to the cool of the Taurus Mountains in the sweltering summer heat. Why not follow their lead and stay in a delightful mountain village like Islamlar, high above the popular resort of Kalkan, with the sea (and restaurants of Kalkan) an alluringly short drive away below. Islamlar is justly famed for restaurants of its own – of the rustic trout-farm variety – and babbling brooks. The fantastic sandy beach at Patara is only half an hour away, a number of ancient Lycian sites such as Xanthos not much further. Turquoise Collection offers a superb-range of stylish properties in this upmarket mountain village, some with infinity pools, all with stunning views. Turquoise Collection offers several properties in Islamlar, including four luxury villas with large pools sleeping up to eight from £1,750 ( theturquoisecollection.com ). • Turquoise Coast travel guide Villa Lavander Islamar Stay in a delightful mountain village like Islamlar 4. Villa Lisa, Çukurbag Peninsula Arcing out into the deep blue bay fronting the picturesque resort of Kas, the quiet Çukurbag Peninsula is an ideal spot for a villa break. For the most part the only sounds are the lapping of waves against the rocks, the creak of cicadas and the odd putt-putt of a passing fishing boat. Beaches are thin on the ground but the stylish Villa Lisa sleeps six and has a wonderful infinity pool affording glorious views south across the bay to the Greek island of Kastellorizo. There’s a good choice of supplies available in Kas, especially the fruit and veg from the weekly market, and plenty of café-bars and restaurants to choose from. Kas4villarentals (0177 962 0473; kas4villarentals.com ) offers Villa Lisa, which sleeps 6, From £970 (0177 962 0473; kas4villarentals.com ).

Çesme Only an hour’s drive from Izmir international airport and bang opposite the Greek island of Chios, Çesme is often overlooked by British holidaymakers. In common with its better-known neighbour further east on the peninsula, Alaçati, the town’s old quarter is comprised of pretty Greek houses clustered around an imposing Genoese castle. The beach at nearby Altinkum (literally Golden Sands) lives up to its name and is one of the best on the Aegean coast; the ferry ride to Chios makes a very satisfying day trip. With its near constant breeze, Çesme is nowhere near as humid as many Turkish resorts in the heat of summer, making it an ideal July/August option. Owners Direct has a number of villas for rent in and around the town, most with sea views. From £545 for a smart modern villa sleeping six, with its own pool a five-minute walk from the town centre ( ownersdirect.co.uk , property reference TK569). A modern villa near Cesme town centre can be had for less than £600 a week Photo: Owners Direct 6. Bodrum Peninsula The intricately indented north-western shores of the Bodrum Peninsula are beautiful and the sea inviting – rare monk seals are occasionally sighted. Out to sea, tiny islets dot the clear, blue waters, while inland the hills and valley sides are laced with shepherds’ paths and dotted with olive trees and more unusual vegetation like prickly pears and wild palms. Seaside villages such as Yaklikavak have plenty of great places to eat, as well as a marina and serviceable beach – for better sand head to the south shore of the peninsula or to Gümüslük to the west. Ilios Travel has a few choice properties both in this area and elsewhere on the Aegean/Mediterranean coast, including charming, stone-built Almond Tree House in Gökçebel, which sleeps six and has its own large pool, a rustic yet elegant whitewashed farmhouse-style interior and a great roof terrace. Alomd Tree House from £1,100 (01444 225633; iliostravel.com ). The Almond Tree House villa has a rustic yet elegant whitewashed farmhouse-style interior and a great roof terrace. Photo: Ilios Travel 7. Kaya Köyü There is something truly special about the bucolic valley that unfurls at the feet of the remarkable ghost settlement of Kaya Köyü. Known as Levissi when it was a vibrant Greek community (until 1923), it is now a collection of cobbled paths, roofless stone homes and attractive churches that stare down on the fertile valley from a terraced hillside above. Behind the ridges circling the valley is the Mediterranean, the famous lagoon at Ölüdeniz a spectacular one and a half hour’s walk away, pretty Gemiler beach a 15-minute drive. Exclusive Escapes has several premium villas available in this rural idyll, all blending in tastefully with the time-worn environment of the valley. Sarniç Evi (the Cistern House) is a two-bed (sleeps five) villa converted from a 200-year-old house, with fantastic views of the valley and the ghost town. • The best of Turkey's Turquoise Coast Sarniç Evi is frrom £1,100 per person based on two sharing, £750 per week for each extra person, flights included (020 8605 3500; exclusiveescapes.co.uk ).

Uçhisar, Cappadocia Located on the cliff-tops a mile or so above the tourist honey-pot of Göreme, Uçhisar has withstood the vicissitudes of development far more successfully than its neighbour in the valley below. The low-key village is dominated by a near 200ft-high natural stone outcrop riddled with rock-cut dwellings. It makes a great base for exploring the magical volcanic landscape of Cappadocia – but the key to making Uçhisar such a great place to stay are the mesmeric sunset views across the bizarre Cappadocian landscape to distant Mt Erciyes. The presence of the well-regarded Kocabag winery on the edge of the village is another boon. Les Maisons des Cappadoce has nine stylish villas in Uçhisar, along with a clutch of studio apartments. Maison Le Jardin sleeps up to six, has a pleasant garden and the living room is hollowed from the volcanic tuff. Maison Le Jardin is from €360 (£254) per night; discounts for longer stays are available (0090 384 219 28 13 ; cappadocia.info ) Uçhisar has withstood the vicissitudes of development far more successfully than some of its neighbours Photo: Alamy 9. Lake Iznik Relatively few foreigners venture out to beautiful Lake Iznik, even though it’s only a couple of hours’ ferry/car journey away from Istanbul . Fringed by reeds and ringed by mountains, the still, clear waters of the lake are a delight for bird-watchers. The old, walled town of the same name, at the eastern end of the lake, is a laid-back place serving the local agricultural community (olives are big business here) and Istanbulites escaping the big city. Famed for the ecumenical council which took place here in 325, a defining moment in the development of Christianity (known to posterity as the Council of Nicaea), it is home to a Roman theatre, Byzantine churches and Ottoman mosques. A couple of rustic yet elegant houses on the north shore of the lake, designed by their architect-owner, make for delightful rural retreats, with swimming, cycling and fishing just some of the things to do. Three-bed Kriska’s House, with its wrap-around upper floor, from £1,239 (0090 224 589 10 25; kriskashome.com ). • Is Alacati Turkey's best kept secret? 10. Dalyan Delta The delta of the lazy, meandering Dalyan river, is one of Turkey’s natural wonders. Not least because it ends not in some fetid swamp, but at the white curve of spectacular Iztuzu beach, a major nesting site of the loggerhead turtle. The fresh waters of the river mean the area is rich in wildlife. More than 150 bird species can be found here, including pelicans and kingfishers. Dalyan town has retained much of its village charm, there’s the well-preserved ancient site of Kaunos to visit just across the river, as well as the health-giving (and fun!) mudbaths of Köycegiz. Dalyanvillas has dozens of properties in this unique area; one of the best is Gökbel, in a tiny settlement high above the river, which sleeps nine and offers panoramic views over the delta, beach and Mediterranean. From £775 (0191 567 2646; dalyanvillas.com ). For our other expert holiday selections in Turkey see our top 10 beach holidays , culture holidays , activity holidays and food and drink holidays.
