The Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport is now allowing previously-banned rideshare operator Lyft to transport passengers to and from the airport. Ridesharing companies like Lyft and Uber were previously banned from picking up or dropping off passengers at CVG citing safety, licensing and insurance concerns. Lyft has now received a permit to transport passengers to and from CVG. “Our customers want options,” CVG CEO Candace McGraw said in a news release. “Lyft joins other ground transportation options including rental cars, taxi cabs, On-Demand Van/Shuttle and TANK.” Lyft allows customers to request a driver using a smartphone application, pairs riders with available nearby drivers and handles payment through the app. Uber, another popular ridesharing service that functions in a similar way, is in the process of completing its application to operate at CVG, airport spokeswoman Melissa Wideman told me. \"We look forward to working with Uber to complete an operating agreement. This will occur once Uber receives and provides the required Kentucky certificates,\" she said. \nWant Cincinnati Logistics & Transportation news in your inbox?
