So, apart from a major lick of paint for the game's website, what can you look forward to ahead of the new season? Firstly, the top prize has increased from £35,000 to £50,000. There will also be more ways to win a prize than ever before. We'll be running unlimited numbers of 'Elite Leagues' - leagues of 20 teams that you can pay to join, adding to the excitement and giving you the best chance of winning a prize ever offered by a national Fantasy Football competition. The vast majority of the scoring rules are unchanged (if it ain't broke...) but there are a couple of tweaks to how clean sheets are scored for defenders to make things fairer as well as to the the transfer system. Clean sheets - goalkeepers and defenders In order to earn +5 clean sheet bonus points, your player must complete at least 60 minutes of the match and his team must keep a clean sheet for the entire match (excluding penalty shoot-outs). If a player is on the pitch for less than 60 minutes and his team keeps a clean sheet for the full match, he'll score +2 clean sheet points. While the player is on the pitch, he will not be penalised for the first goal conceded but will lose one point for every goal conceded after that - same as last season. All players still earn +2 points for being in the starting XI of a match and +1 for coming on as a substitute. So, for example, if your player starts the match, plays an hour or more and his team finishes the match with a clean sheet - then your goalkeeper / defender will score +7 points. Transfers We'll be increasing the number of transfers from 30 to 36. We'll also be allowing transfers between the majority of kick-off times which has been popular in World Cup and European Championship versions of TFF. So, for example, if you want to bring in a player ahead of a 5.30pm kick-off on a Saturday, you will no longer have to complete that transfer before 12.45pm that day. The exception to this rule will be when matches overlap - which tends to happens fairly infrequently. So, for example, if there are kick-offs at 1pm and 2pm or if there are matches starting at 7.45pm and 8pm - then the earliest kick-off time will be the transfer deadline for those matches. Key Contributions There will be some small alterations to the Key Contribution rules. A goalkeeper judged to be punching the ball away will now cancel out a key contribution as opposed to a keeper making a save or parry which may still result in a KC. A player being fouled for a penalty will now be awarded a KC - we are dropping the requirement that he is in control of the ball when that foul occurs. You'll be able to register your new teams soon, we'll let you know as soon as the site opens.
