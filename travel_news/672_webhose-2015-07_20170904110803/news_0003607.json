The city is an attraction in itself and days can be lost wandering around it.\nGrand Central Terminal hardly feels like a train station – more of a spectacular stage, home to the emotional finale of Crocodile Dundee (or Carlito’s Way, if you prefer cooler films).\nHigh Line: Running from Manhattan’s Meat Packing district\nThe city is a lot greener than you would expect, and the many beautiful parks are a great place to hang out and people-watch for free.\nI grabbed a huge Cuban sandwich from a deli near the New York Public Library, and enjoyed it in Bryant Park before I took advantage of the free chess and Jenga tables.\nOf all the things you can do without spending a cent, the wonderful High Line trumps most.\nRunning from Manhattan’s Meat Packing district, the disused raised railroad has had a $100million transformation into a “park in the sky”. A sunset stroll along its mile-and-a-half length provided perfect views up and down the city’s straight streets.\nA city guide is highly recommended, especially with Ellen Baird, from Free Tours on Foot, which cost me nothing.\nThe park is not far from Roger Smith, a boutique art hotel which is about as traditional as you will get for £130 a night in Manhattan. For something a bit more modern, Yotel is a perfect base to explore the city – and you’re just a subway ride from the rest of New York.\nFilm set: Grand Central Station\nUnlimited travel for a week costs just $30 (£19) – taking you up to the Bronx, all the way to Staten Island and the furthest corners of Brooklyn.\nWhile the well-heeled head out to Long Island and the Hamptons, I was more than happy to make the hour’s journey south-east to Coney Island. It’s wonderfully kitsch and trash – think Blackpool USA.\nIn between Manhattan and the Brooklyn seafront is the appropriately named “other” Fifth Avenue in Park Slope.\nThe antithesis of its expensive sister in the Upper East Side, it is filled with boutique stores and interesting restaurants. Try La Villa for a perfect slice of real New York pizza. Other cheap but authentic treats came courtesy of Paul’s Da Burger Joint in the East Village and Luncheonette off Lexington for bacon and pancakes in syrup.\nAs a first timer, I did barely enough to dent New York’s surface, but still came home needing a week-long sleep to recuperate. And I managed to do this without bankrupting myself.\nNew York's top freebies The Museum of Modern Art is free on Fridays between 4pm and 8pm. moma.org Take the Staten Island Ferry.
