At 2:28 UTC on Saturday an earthquake struck the Santa Cruz Islands region in the Pacific Ocean. \nA tsunami wave was possible for coasts located within 300 km of the earthquake epicenter. \nThis region could include Lata in the Solomon Islands that is only 75 km from the earthquake center. \nThe earthquake was downgraded from 7.5 to 6.9 and the threat for a tsunami was eliminated. \nLata is the provincial capital of Temotu Province, Solomon Islands. As of 2007, it had 553 inhabitants. There are a few rest houses for overnight stays. There is a post office, telecom office and numerous stores. \nThe town contains a small air strip with flights to Makira and Honiara.
