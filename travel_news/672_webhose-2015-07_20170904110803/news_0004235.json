A fascinating thing to do is to stay in the sassi in a cave hotel. Sassi hotels are in caves that have been renovated and modernized and normally have private baths, internet, air conditioning, and heating. \nThese well-rated Matera cave hotels (or hotels with view of the sassi ) have links to Hipmunk , where you can see guest ratings and photos and search for the best prices for your dates.

James Martin, Europe Travel â€¢ Locanda di San Martino Hotel and Thermae \nLocanda di San Martino is a 3-star hotel set in a former church and cave houses in the sassi, very near Matera's city center.
