According to post-tour reports, the Puerto Rican singer-songwriter's seven-city tour topped an attendance of more than 110,000 spectators from all around Europe. \nThe tour's last three shows, which routed to end in Valencia/Malaga, Spain and Rotterdam, Netherlands, ended strong and wildly successful, avowing the public's ecstatic await after a seven-year absence from stages across the European continent. \nAnthony kicked off his \"Cambio de Piel\" tour across the continent after a seven-year absence from European territory, on July 7, 2015 in Zürich, Switzerland with multiple sold-out shows. There was also a surprise appearance from the Cuban group phenomenon, Gente de Zona, in Málaga where Marc Anthony invited them up to the stage for a brief performance of their famous \"Gozadera\" dance moves. \nThe tour held solid momentum and according to one of Spain's most prestigious publications, Diario Sur, Anthony's performance was 'worth the 55 euros that minimally cost to enter.' Thousands of fans expressed their awaited desire to see the salsa musician perform by chanting,\"Esto si que es un pedazo de artista,\" translated to 'This is one heck of an artist'. \nAnthony continues to move forward with his solo tour Cambio de Piel at famed venues in Mexico and the rest of Latin America, followed by dates in the U.S. in September alongside of Colombian superstar Carlos Vives in UNID2 , a 15-city tour produced by Cardenas Marketing Network, Inc., (CMN).
