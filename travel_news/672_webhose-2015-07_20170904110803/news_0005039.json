Robert Menendez (left) and Cory Booker (right) Sen. Bob Menendez, a Democrat from Paramus who co-sponsored a law setting the framework for how Congress will review the agreement, said the deal reached by the United States, Russia and European powers to be “worrisome” because it called for lifting economic sanctions without requiring Iran to end all uranium enrichment.\nBuy this photo Rodney Frelinghuysen Buy this photo AP file photo Rep. Scott Garrett “The bottom line is: The deal doesn’t end Iran’s nuclear program – it preserves it,” Menendez said, noting Iran could “keep their nuclear infrastructure in place, and have a pathway to pursuing a nuclear bomb in 10 to 15 years.”\nRelated: Iran nuclear deal: Fine 'new chapter' or 'historic mistake'?\nAt the same time, he stopped short of saying he’d oppose it the deal on the Senate floor, quoting New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman’s characterization that it could be the “best bad deal” possible.\nSen. Cory Booker, a Newark Democrat would not say what he’ll do when it comes time to vote on the agreement.\n“I’m going to spend the next coming weeks digging into every bit of minutiae and detail, sitting in classified briefings and I’ll come up with a decision that I think’s best for safety and security of the United States of America and the globe,” he said.\nBooker said he was “highly skeptical” because Iran has “sworn to destroy Israel,” sponsored terrorism around the world, and “proven to be untrustworthy consistently in the past.” But he said he wants to hear why the administration believes it has struck a good deal.\n“I’m not looking at this in terms of politics,” Booker said. “I’m looking at it with my heart and my head and what I believe is best and that’s how I’m going to vote.”\nMenendez cosponsored the law earlier that blocks Obama from dropping any sanctions on Iran for 60 days, during which Congress could pass a resolution rejecting the agreement.\nObama said Wednesday he would veto such a bill, but his critics would likely seek an override.\nRepublicans from New Jersey and nationally condemned the agreement.\n“The Iranian regime has done nothing to prove that it has earned the trust or respect of the international community, and therefore should not be rewarded with good faith gestures or sanctions relief,” said Rep. Scott Garrett, a Republican from Wantage whose district is dominated by Bergen County voters.\nRep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, a Republican from Harding whose district includes parts of Bergen and Passaic counties, called the agreement “a major victory for Iran” and said he would fight against “any agreement that further jeopardizes U.S. national security and Middle East stability.”\nRep. Leonard Lance, a Republican from Clinton Township, said he believed the deal not only increased the threat to Israel from Iran, it also could lead to Saudi Arabia and Egypt pursuing their own nuclear weapons, increasing instability in the Middle East.\nGovernor Christie said Obama made “humiliating concessions” andshould have walked away from the negotiations.\n“I urge Republicans and Democrats in Congress to put aside politics and act in the national interest,” Christie said in a statement. “Vote to disapprove this deal in numbers that will override the President's threatened veto.”\nSome Democrats, such as Rep. Albio Sires of West New York, were undecided.\n“I have some reservations,” Sires said as he left a House caucus meeting where he said former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had endorsed the agreement. “I want to read the 80-page deal. I want to know how binding it is. I want to know how far it goes.”\nOthers were more supportive of Obama.\nRep. Bill Pascrell, a Democrat from Paterson, said negotiators deserved praise for doing “a great, great job.”\n“It’s not going to be everything everybody wants, but no deal usually is,” he said. “At first blush, I think it’s something in the direction which I wanted. The verification is very important. And what are the alternatives? I think that’s a very important question.”\nSome of his colleagues suggested the alternative was a military strike on Iran, which they opposed.\n“I have consistently supported diplomacy over military action to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran,” said Rep. Donald Payne, a Democrat from Newark.\nRep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, a Democrat from Trenton, said the agreement accomplished many of the goals she had set.\n“It slows down their access to nuclear weapons,” she said. “It’s verifiable. There’s opportunity there and time to create even a greater sense of peace. I would like to read it first, but I’d certainly pursue diplomacy over war.”\nEmail: jackson@northjersey.com Blog: northjersey.com/thepoliticalstate", "external_links": ["http://northjersey.mycapture.com/mycapture/lookup.asp?originalname=MC_041714_MT_RodneyFrelinghuysen.jpg", "http://northjersey.mycapture.com/mycapture/lookup.asp?originalname=MC_Garrett.jpg", "http://northjersey.mycapture.com/mycapture/lookup.asp?originalname=MC_02182014menendez_booker_dngnk.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-14T23:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T23:23:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
