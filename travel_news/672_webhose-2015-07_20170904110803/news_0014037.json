Assessors commended the historic venue for the way sustainability has been incorporated into the business, and the creation of a ‘Green Team’ to champion how continuous improvements can be made. In particular the Assembly Rooms’ charters for visitors and event organisers were noted as an excellent way of encouraging everyone who uses the building to act responsibly. \nHighlights of the Assembly Rooms’ achievements include 90 per cent recycling results; the introduction of bioplastics into biodegradable plastic cups; upcycling of older materials; plus working with ethical suppliers such as Belu Water which supports Water Aid, and St Jude’s laundry which operates as a social enterprise. Commenting on the award, Shona Clelland, general manager of Assembly Rooms Edinburgh, said: “This is a huge accolade for our team, and we are proud that the changes we have made and continue to make have been recognised in this way. “It is less than two years since we embarked on our sustainability journey through working with Resource Efficient Scotland, and we have already made great strides. Next time we will be going for gold!” Jon Proctor, Green Tourism Director added: “I was very impressed with the genuine commitment of the organisation and the team towards being a leading green tourism business. As the site is an important venue in the world renowned Edinburgh Fringe Festival, Assembly Rooms leads the way for other international venues in taking sustainable events seriously.” The Green Tourism Business Scheme is designed to reward tourism businesses which are working positively towards being sustainable and is the largest and most established grading programme in the world.
