This much is clear. If government officials can just find a way to keep terribly cash-strapped Illinois open and functioning, the tourists will come The Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity's Office of Tourism said today that 2014 marked the fourth consecutive year of record-breaking tourism in the state. Per state figures, the tourism industry hosted more than 109.4 million visitors in 2014, a 3.5 increase over 2013. Those 2014 visitors reportedly generated more than $36.3 billion in travel expenditures for the state's economy. In addition, state and local tax revenues generated from visitor spending rose to $2.7 billion in 2014, an increase of $133.8 million over 2013 figures. Visitor expenditures in 2014 directly supported more than 306,000 jobs, an increase of 5,000 new jobs for the year. Noted Cory Jobe , director of the Illinois Office of Tourism: \"Aggressive tourism promotion not only brings new visitors and repeat travelers, but it results in tangible quality of life benefits and job opportunities for Illinoisans across the state.\" Jobe also announced today two new initiatives. Next spring, the Office of Tourism will launch Enjoy, a bi-annual travel magazine in both hardcopy and digital format. The digital version will include exclusive web content. This fall, the Office of Tourism will introduce \"Illinois Made,\" a program to showcase the state's artists, inventors, innovators and makers of products. \nWant Chicago Media & Marketing   Industries", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T21:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T21:47:40.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
