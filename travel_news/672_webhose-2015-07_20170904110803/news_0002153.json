Chile and Venezuela are “escort” countries. All four had called for an urgent de-escalation of the violence.\nColombia’s civil strife dates back to 1964 and has drawn in left-wing guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries and drug gangs, killing more than 220,000 people and uprooting as many as six million.\nFARC rebels had been observing a unilateral ceasefire since December , and it led to relative calm.\nBut clashes resumed in mid-April, following an ambush by the rebels that left 11 soldiers dead. Each side blames the other for the escalation. The FARC ended their truce in May.\nDuring that truce, the fighters claim that government forces stepped up attacks on rebel camps.\nSince that truce ended, about 30 rebels have been killed in army operations and recent surveys show the public is increasingly wary about the peace process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T05:15:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
