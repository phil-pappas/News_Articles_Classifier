Dense forests, lush green meadows, gurgling rivulets, swollen Bhilangana river..Tough and risky too..lots of hard ice patches, land slide zones.. But I am not posting this merely to describe the beauty and toughness of the trek. A shocking thing weve witnessed there. Ive done a No. of treks in Himachal, Garhwal, Kumaon, Nepal, West Bengal and Sikkim Himalayas, but have never seen this kind of thing. WEVE MET PEOPLE CARRYING GUNS IN THIS ROUTE!!! Not once but at least twice. I managed to ask one gun bearer what he was doing with a gun there, he told he was guarding their flock of sheep. But as soon as I wanted to take a photo of him, he ran like a rabbit and disappeared inside the dense forest. Now, this place is located inside Gangotri National Park, how one could bring a gun there? I asked our guide about this, he reluctantly replied shikar ke liye, means these guns are meant for poaching!! Our porters also agreed with him. But none of them wanted to elaborate, seemed they were afraid to discuss about this. I hope some of our group members are Animal Rights activists and they will take notice of the incidence Ive described. Have any of you witnessed similar kind of thing anywhere in the Himalayas?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T18:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T20:58:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
