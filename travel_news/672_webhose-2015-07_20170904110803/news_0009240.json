The central character in this sad tale is almost always the bereaved ‘mama bird’, the mother who has, perhaps, found it a little difficult snipping those apron strings and who weeps inwardly every time she passes the doors of the rooms where her babies once slept. But is this an accurate portrayal of the modern-day empty nester? Well, according to recent research, it would appear not. One survey, carried out recently by Cotton Traders , revealed that 75 per cent of freed-up females are actually OK about their kids leaving home. These Happy Empty Nesters (HENs) actively look forward to the day when they get their home – and their lives – back, and allegedly start making plans way before the kids have even thought about going! These are the women who, instead of making a shrine out of their son or daughter’s bedroom, are getting plans drawn-up for a new walk-in wardrobe! Empty nest: absence makes the heart mushy Artist and designer Ann Brewer, 53, from Twickenham, agrees, saying: “Now my two boys have left home, I love being able to use the whole house as one big creative area. The wall between the children’s bedroom has gone now and I can make use of the space however I want ,without having to worry about getting in the kids’ way.” (John Lawrence) As a mum of four myself, I can relate to this. But I can’t relate to the mourning, the moaning and the moping of the mother left behind. Years ago, when my kids were small, I’d look at these 50-somethings with envy, wistfully thinking “one day that will be me…” • Filling the empty nest: Peace, quiet and time for new challenges When I was a child, I was obsessed with the thought of leaving home: couldn’t wait to grow up and get out into the world. I had big plans and felt compelled to vocalize them. Many of my sentences back then started with ‘when I leave home….’ My mum seemed accepting of my enthusiasm to break away at the earliest opportunity. My dad would listen but never said much. In Father of the Bride, Steve Martin's character couldn't bear his daughter leaving home (REX) I always believed that when I finally left, my mum would be pretty cool about it and that my dad would be the one who’d find it hard. But one day, when I was about 15, my dad told me that I should really stop going on about leaving home; that it was upsetting my mum. It hadn’t crossed my mind that my talk of moving out would upset her. Why would she be upset? Surely, as a woman who’d brought her daughter up to be so independent, she’d be proud of that kind of talk! If I ever had a daughter, I’d be proud, I told my teenage self. My dad said: “She’s kind of in denial about it all. I’m OK with it. When you go, she’ll be the one who suffers.” Whether she suffered or not, I’ll never know. As soon as I hit 18, I left and didn’t look back. Call me ungrateful. • Why the average British adult is 19 years behind on their 'life goals' Most nest-leavers don’t look back. And most HENs don’t expect gratitude. Marie Spencer, a 52-year-old nurse from Nottingham, mother of four grown-ups, says her job, as far as she’s concerned, is to launch them. And that, she says, is when you as a mother see the results of all your hard work. “It’s only when they leave home that you see how effective your ‘training’ has been. To let each child go without making them feel guilty is the way to do it – it’s you as a parent acknowledging that they are their own person. And I’m happy to do that.” My own eldest daughter (now 26) never spoke about leaving – not the way I did when I was a child anyway (i.e. incessantly!) – but I still used to think about her going. When she finally flew the nest, I was well-prepared and it wasn’t a wrench at all. The fact she was a mere two miles away probably helped. And because I still had three younger children at home, I really didn’t have time to wallow or pine. As long as I knew she was OK and as long as I still saw her from time to time, I was happy. Unlike Jacqui's children, Matthew McConaughey's character in Failure to Launch refused to leave the nest (Paramount) So was Kettering-based mum-of-two (boys, aged 20 and 25) and professional singer Lynda Hayes, who says jubilantly: “I can't recommend the empty nest highly enough! When your kids are living at home, you have to be a mother. When they leave, you get to be more like you were before you had children. You rediscover your true self. I’m doing that now and I absolutely love it!” It would be some time before I got that sense of self back. In 2012, we (myself, my two teenage daughters and my son) found ourselves living in a flat that was far too small for us. It was hard work living with two aspiring alpha females: there was a constant battle for supremacy. We eventually decided that the girls should move in with their dad for a bit. I felt a bit guilty but when, after a couple of months, it became clear that they were happy, that their dad was pleased to have them and that they weren’t missing me in the slightest, the guilt lifted and I allowed myself to enjoy my newfound space. Three down and one to go! • Generation boomerang: how to cope with grown-up children at home My son, the ‘baby’ is like me, in that he has been talking about leaving home for years! He has plans, business ideas: he can’t wait to get out there. He starts college in September, so by 2017, I should be free…. I will be myself, not just ‘mum’. Yes, in a couple of years’ time, I’ll be ready to show the world who I am and what I am truly capable of. But, hang on… what’s this? ‘Baby’ is wanting to leave home early? At 16? He’ll move in with his friend’s family, he says. They live right near the college. He’ll get a part-time job. He’ll pay rent. Well, that’s a surprise! Not that I’ve been in denial. I may be the owner of a rapidly emptying nest, but I’m no mummy ostrich! No - I am positively thrilled to have successfully reared such a fine, mature and confident son. It’s all good. Even though he’s the last one to leave, I’m 100 per cent delighted. He’s making his way. As he should. And I’m happy. Really. A true HEN. A hen doesn't miss • The mess – wet towels on floors, dishes in the sink, shoes everywhere • Interrupted sex. (Or the stress of possibly being interrupted.) • Being woken up when they roll in late – or, worse, not being able to get to sleep until they get home. • Being a human alarm clock. (With a mum there, kids never make the effort to get themselves up out of bed in the mornings.) • The guilt-tripping – the way, when they don’t get their way, they can make you feel like a failure as a parent.
