Improvements are coming â€” slowly. ( Tina Susman ) \nAccording to Cuomo, the $4-billion project will expand LaGuardia's notoriously tight quarters by shifting the airport's footprint 600 feet. He said that would create space for more airline gates, for one new terminal to replace the four disjointed ones, and for construction of rail and ferry links, among other improvements. \nPrivate funding will cover more than half the cost of the project, with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the area's major airports, paying for the rest, Cuomo said. \nAn announcement about the remaking of LaGuardia had been expected, as pressure to do something about the overcrowded, run-down facility has been building for years. \nIn addition to being far too small to handle the more than 26 million passengers it sees each year, LaGuardia has no direct rail links to New York City. \nIf it comes to fruition, the new facility would be the country's first new airport since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, which ushered in new security requirements for travelers and underscored the need for more space to accommodate them. \nIn his state of the state address last year, Cuomo described LaGuardia, with its delays, crowded conditions, lack of amenities and dismal infrastructure, as\"a disgrace.\" Five years ago, Christopher Ward, who was then head of the Port Authority, suggested LaGuardia be torn down. And last year, Biden said that a blindfolded traveler landing at LaGuardia might think they were \"in some third world country.\" \nThat stinging comment drew laughs from listeners and knowing chuckles from weary travelers, but it rankled the Global Gateway Alliance, a nonprofit that said the airport needed public financing, not insults, to fix its problems. \nBiden's comments apparently expedited that effort, and the alliance's chairman, Joseph Sitt, welcomed Monday's announcement and Cuomo's vows to improve other regional airports. \n\"It's a win for the more than 117 million annual passengers that use our airports and for a regional economy that relies on the airports for more than $50 billion in activity,\" Sitt said in a statement, which warned officials to stick to their budget and timelines. \nOther changes announced by Cuomo include construction of a 500-room hotel at John F. Kennedy International Airport, and changes to Stewart Airport 60 miles north of New York City to enable it to handle some commercial and cargo air traffic clogging skies to the south.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T03:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T08:15:41.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
