What’s the best thing about going to the movies? Well, obviously, it’s the story unfolding on screen. But apart from that... The comfy seats? The popcorn? The feature-length adverts? Of course not. It’s the chance to spot locations – a favourite game – the world over. And we’re not just talking about the greatest hits: the Eiffel Tower, Pyramids of Giza, Colosseum, Statue of Liberty – any fool can identify those. The capital isn’t the only spot for scene spotting. Other options include Oxford, Bath and Edinburgh There’s no denying it, the sight of somewhere we know and love (or hate) adds an extra something to the film experience. There’s something gratifying about watching a film set in London and mentally ticking off all the locations – even if (thanks to careful editing) all the landmarks in Britain’s capital city appear to be piled on top of each other. But even better than spotting recognisable places on the big screen is spotting recognisable film locations in real life – and a guided movie tour is a great way to find them. London bus tours Plenty of tours – such as this London Movie Locations Tour – are bus-based, with hops off and on to retrace the footsteps of James Bond, Jason Bourne, King George VI et al. It’s a great way to see many of London’s greatest sights – the Tower of London, St Paul’s, Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square – along the way, so it’s ideal for an out-of-towner or for families hoping to give the kids a proper taste of the capital’s riches. London walking tours There are all-walking options, too. Blockbuster tours (from movies like the Bond, Bourne and Harry Potter franchises as well as funnies such as Johnny English ) and Rom-Com London tours ( Four Weddings and a Funeral , Notting Hill , Bridget Jones’s Diary among others) are popular enough to need advance booking. If you fancy something a bit less mainstream, there are tours of Southwark (nudging up against the South Bank, all Dickens-era taverns and shady back streets), Sherlock Holmes-based walks and even spooky location routes. Outside London Of course, the capital isn’t the only spot for scene spotting. Other options include location tours of Oxford , Bath and Edinburgh and – in the wake of hit television series, Cornwall ( Poldark ), the Hampshire-Berkshire borders ( Downton Abbey ) and Northern Ireland ( Game of Thrones ). Not that you could walk around a whole province in a day or even three. Harry Potter tours As for everyone’s favourite teenage wizard, a mini-industry has built up around tours based on the Harry Potter movies. London Walking Tours and Muggle Tours are just two of the options for exploring J.K. Rowling’s world by foot in London. Or you can head to Scotland, where Black Kilt Tours offers a tour of Harry’s northern haunts. Unsurprisingly, London remains the best option for a compact, total immersion movie trail. Just don’t expect to walk out of King’s Cross station straight onto the Thames Embankment (you know, where Regent’s Park meets Docklands).
