But you're lucky because your wallet wasn't lifted. So what happens when you try to withdraw cash from an automatic teller machine and \"Please Contact Your Bank\" appears on the screen?

I also consume 2 large beers. \nWhen my massage ends, the 2 narrow massage tables are shoved together, I'm given a blanket, and I try to settle down for the night. It's not easy. \nThe massage tables are not the least bit soft. I toss and turn. I wake up sore all over because of the the very hard massage tables, which have very little padding. \nI go downstairs, shower and shave in the changing room, and have a complimentary meal in the main hall. \nThree hour treatments don't just allow you to spend the night. You also get a meal. \nFortunately, I hadn't eaten dinner at the spa the night before because I had already eaten before I got there. So I get to have breakfast without spending any more cash. \nAfter paying and tipping the therapist, I've got 100 rmb, or US$16, left over. I head straight for the Hang Seng Bank branch on People's Road South and attempt to withdraw cash from the ATM. \nHong Kong Monetary Authority Hong Kong Monetary Authority.

So I'm flabbergasted when I attempt to withdraw cash and the following message appears on the screen: \"Please Contact Your Bank\". \nThe branch is closed. I don't know this yet, but it won't reopen until Tuesday because Monday in a national holiday. \nFortunately, I never closed out my US bank account. I am charged a hefty US$25 per withdrawal so I'm loathe to withdraw money from the bank's overseas ATMs, but I've got no choice. \nThe bank doesn't have many branches in Shenzhen, but I'm able to locate one with the help of the concierge at a nearby shopping mall. I pull out the daily maximum. \nFast Forward Lowu MTR station.

I attempt to withdraw cash and get the same message I got in Shenzhen. \nI take the train to Sheung Shui and head straight to the nearest branch of Hang Seng Bank. I walk in and politely demand to speak with the branch manager. It takes some persuading, but eventually I'm given an audience with him. \nAn hour later, it is confirmed that: \n1.) I had applied for overseas ATM cash withdrawal capability; \n2.) my application had been successful; \n3.) it should have gone into effect immediately; and \n4.) I had sufficient funds in my account to make the attempted withdrawal. \nApparently my card had malfunctioned, and a new one will be issued. \nComment and Analysis \nHang Seng Bank headquarters in Central on Hong Kong Island.

Many people were not aware of them and were caught off guard when trying to withdraw money while travelling abroad. I was one of them, and this is what pisses me off. \nThe ATMs never told you your card wouldn't function so you would just give up and figure out another strategy. \nWhen you tried to make a withdrawal, you would be told that you had exceeded the daily maximum so you would try again inputting a smaller amount. When you tried this a second time, inputting an even smaller amount, the same thing happened. \nFollowing the 3rd attempt, you would be told you had exceeded the number of attempts to withdraw cash within a 24 period. So you would try again the following day. \nI would sincerely like someone at Hang Seng Bank to explain to me WHY their ATM machines were not programmed to inform account holders that their cards could not be used to withdraw cash from machines outside Hong Kong rather than telling them that they had exceeded the daily limit. \nThis would have prevented a lot of needless running around and unnecessary confusion. \nTo Be Continued \nMake It Happen! \nShenzhen is a modern city with all manner of accommodation, from luxurious 5 star resorts to modest dormitories to a capsule hotel with capsules renting for just over US$10 a night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T08:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T09:01:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
