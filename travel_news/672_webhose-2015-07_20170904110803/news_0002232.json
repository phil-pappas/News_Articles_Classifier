Freeride advanced models tend to be slightly narrower for a more forgiving ride especially on piste, and suit deep snow less well, while expert models have the widest waists, making them better suited to fast, aggressive powder skiing. Freeride advanced Best on test Volkl 100 Eight £525 Best for: Grip on piste and float off piste The replacement for the much-loved Volkl Gotamas, the 100 Eights have a very similar frame to their predecessors, but with reduced weight. They come top for edge hold, long turns, high speed, smoothness, off piste and moguls. Off piste, they're excellent for flying through chopped up powder and floating effortlessly in untracked snow. For such wide skis underfoot, they hold an edge surprisingly well on piste. In short turns, they're not the liveliest, but they pivot easily due to their full rocker. Tech talk Sidewall construction, with a core that uses two densities of wood – stronger beech under the binding, lighter poplar at tips and tails. Core is reinforced with fibreglass. A central ridge is cut out along the length of the topsheet, helping to reduce weight. Rockered on the entire length of the ski. + Edge hold, long turns, high speed, smoothness, off piste, moguls – None Lengths: 173, 181, 189 Sidecut: 141/108/124 (all lengths) Radius: 22m (181) Best value Rossignol Sin 7 £450 (including bindings) Best for: Nippy short turns off piste As well as leading the group for liveliness/responsiveness, the Sin 7s also score well for short turns and low speed. Super easy to turn and very lively – think “turn” and they do it – they're most suited to off piste, where they're very nippy. But when cranked up, they become a bit jittery, and they don't do well at racing speeds. Tech talk Partial cap construction with a wood core strengthened with fibreglass. Tips and tails are filled with air to reduce weight while retaining torsional rigidity. Rockered 50 per cent at tips and tails. + Short turns, low speed, liveliness/responsiveness – High speed Lengths: 164, 172, 180, 188 Sidecut: 128/98/118 (all lengths) Radius: 17m (180) Women's freeride advanced Best on test K2 Full Luv It 98Ti £430 Best for: Easy, playful turns in all conditions The Full Luv Its are deemed best of this category for edge hold, short turns, long turns, low speed, smoothness, liveliness/responsiveness, off piste and groomed piste. Really easy, playful skis, they allow poppy turns through both soft and heavy snow. They're easy to control at high speeds and feel reliable on all terrain. They also hold their own on piste, where they give a super smooth ride. Tech talk Cap construction with sidewalls underfoot and a aspen/paulownia/bamboo wood core reinforced with fibreglass and titanal. Rockered at tips and tails. + Edge hold, short turns, long turns, low speed, smoothness, liveliness/responsiveness, off piste, groomed piste – None Lengths: 163, 170, 177 Sidecut: 131/98/119 (all lengths) Radius: 17.5m (170) Best value Atomic Vantage 95 C W £500 (including bindings) Best for: Inspiring confidence all over the mountain These are the successors to the Vantage Elysians, Atomic's previous top progressive all-mountain women's ski. They top the group for high speed, versatility and moguls, also scoring excellently for off piste. Powerhouses that are easy to ride, they glide through whatever they're confronted with, with minimal effort. Confidence-inspiring skis that love the whole mountain, they power through deep powder, allowing easy, bouncy turns. Tech talk Cap construction with full sidewalls under the bindings and a poplar wood core strengthened with woven carbon mesh. Rockered 15 per cent at the the tips, 10 per cent at the tails. + High speed, versatility, off piste, moguls – None Lengths: 154, 162, 170 Sidecut: 132/95/118 (170) Radius: 16.8m (170) Freeride Expert Best on test Best value Rossignol Soul 7 £615 (including bindings) Best for: Slashing pockets and hitting steep and deep lines The Soul 7s dominate the freeride expert skis in low speed, smoothness, versatility, off piste and moguls. Very light, agile, and easy to turn in powder, they're great for slashing pockets of deep snow and darting through trees. At their best in powder, they're less stable on ice. They're ideal for skiers looking to hit steep and deep lines, and be creative over big jumps. They score better for low speed than for high speed. Tech talk Partial cap construction, with a paulownia wood core strengthened with fibreglass. Tips and tails are filled with air to reduce weight while retaining torsional rigidity. Rockered 50 per cent at front and back. + Low speed, smoothness, versatility, off piste, moguls – None Lengths: 164, 172, 180, 188 Sidecut: 136/106/126 (all lengths) Radius: 17m (180) Best on test Volkl Mantra £525 Best for: Reliability and responsiveness, on piste or off The Mantras lead the group for edge hold, short turns, liveliness/responsiveness, versatility and groomed piste. Responsive, light and nimble, they're easy to turn, on and off piste. They'll do what you tell them to; lay them over and get your legs out there, and these skis will support you and come back round thanks to the full rocker. They're good for expert skiers looking to hike to big lines with reliable skis they can depend on. Tech talk Sidewall construction containing a core that uses two densities of wood: stronger beech under the bindings, lighter poplar at tips and tails. Core is reinforced with titanium. Rockered along their entire length. + Edge hold, short turns, liveliness/responsiveness, versatility, groomed piste – None Lengths: 170, 177, 184, 191 Sidecut: 132/100/118 (all lengths) Radius: 25.4m (184) Women's freeride expert Best on test Movement Believe £499 Best for: On-piste stability and hard-charging through bashed up snow The Believes lead the group in high speed and smoothness, also doing excellently for edge hold, versatility and off piste. Stiff, stable and secure on groomed pistes and at speed in deeper snow, they're good for charging and bashing through crud. A great combination of powerful and playful, they provide total control off piste and on groomers. They flick you neatly out of turns, and fly beautifully through powder. Tech talk Partial cap construction, with a karuba wood core reinforced with carbon and fibreglass. Rockered at tips and tails. + Edge hold, high speed, smoothness, versatility, off piste – None Lengths: 168, 176 Sidecut: 131/99/119 (176) Radius: 20m (176) Best value Fischer Ranger W89 £570 (including bindings) Best for: A smooth ride in all conditions Judged best in the category for versatility, groomed piste and moguls, they also perform impressively for edge hold, long turns and smoothness. Highly efficient in poor quality tracked out snow, they make precision turns simple. Easy turning and versatile, they're a breeze through the powder, and instill confidence on piste with great grip. Although they provide a very smooth ride, they're also lively and bouncy through the bumps. They achieve better marks for high speed than low speed. Tech talk Partial cap construction with a wood core strengthened with titanal. The shovels are ultra-thin and inlaid with carbon fibre for added manoeuvrability. Rockered at tips and tails. + Edge hold, long turns, smoothness, versatility, groomed piste, moguls – None Lengths: 157, 165, 172, 179 Sidecut: 122/90/111 (all lengths) Radius: 17m (172) • Ski test winners: On-piste skis • Ski test winners: All-mountain skis • Ski test winners: Big mountain skis • Ski test winners: Park & pipe skis • Ski test winners: Hike & ride skis Follow @telegraphtravel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T22:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T17:51:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
