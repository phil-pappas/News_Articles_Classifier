Out of the five that I selected, they rejected me, it was probably because of my predicted grades. I took a few years out of education to work in the airline industry. While I was studying, I was working full time in the airport. Just before my exams started in my second year, I was made redundant, which was good as I was able to focus on revision. From there, I already knew I was going to apply through Clearing. I had already talked to a lot of my friends at different universities; I had a lot of advice about what to do and how to do it. When I was studying for my A-levels, I didn’t really go to college due to timetable clashes. I studied independently. I thought maths might be a bit difficult, seeing as I self-taught most of the course using online resources. But my results went way better than I expected; I ended up with a B in maths. I was doing an AAT course and a BTEC at the same time, and I ended up getting a lot of my Ucas points from the diploma. I got two distinction stars. I wanted to go into either maths or accounting, but by failing to get the A grade in maths, I decided that accounting was better for me in the long term. I could have gone to a lot of universities, but I really wanted to go to Lougborough, for the sports and because it was ranked seventh for the course I wanted to do. The business school has a good reputation and I just thought I would fit in there. As I said, I always had Clearing in the back of my mind. I used the Telegraph Clearing app, which was really helpful. It made it easy for me to have a look at which universities had places. There were so many to choose from, really good ones like Warwick, Bath and the University of Birmingham. I would say to all students, always see what’s out there for you. Even if you don’t do as well as expected, you can still end up in a better situation. Before you can apply, you have to check whether you are eligible for Clearing in Track; you have to wait until all your choices have been decided. Some universities take longer to update their systems. I was waiting on Aston for a while. I called universities and explained the situation to them. Loughborough were able to give me an offer, but I had to sort everything out in a set time frame. Thankfully, by then, Aston had released me. The process was relatively easy, I didn’t find it that stressful. You just have to make a few phone calls. For Clearing, I would say, if you’ve got to resort to a plan B, just stay on top of it. Make sure that you do your research about universities beforehand. You’ve got to be really active after you get your results. Keep calling people, stay persistent; even when you talk to someone and they don't get back to you when they say they will. When I was calling Loughborough they were taking ages to respond, so I kept calling. You want to make sure you’re on the ball, you don’t want someone else to decide what’s going on because, by then, your place might be gone. I had so much fun at Loughborough this year. When I went to open days, Loughborough really stuck out to me. And even though I didn’t get the offer initially, I was determined to get here. • Step-by-step guide to A-level Results Day • Step-by-step guide to Clearing • Step-by-step guide to Adjustment • Download the Telegraph's Clearing app for iPhone and Android Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T17:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T13:07:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
