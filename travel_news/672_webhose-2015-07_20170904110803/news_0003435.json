Apply or renew at the official website . Be warned: there are a number of unofficial websites offering to renew cards for a fee but there is no need to pay for this service. \nDo I need travel insurance as well? \nIf you have both travel insurance and an EHIC, you should be able to reclaim many of the above costs and many insurers will waive the excess charge on medical claims. If you have travel insurance but no EHIC, then some insurers may not pay for any medical treatment, as the small print of these policies states all travellers must have a valid card. If you travel with an EHIC card and no insurance you will also miss out on cover for lots of other aspects of your trip - lost baggage, stolen cameras or, in some circumstances, cancelled holidays for example. See our guide . \nMost insurers also offer 24-hour helplines and assistance services, putting you in touch with English-speaking doctors and helping to rearrange flights and accommodation for yourself and your family in a real emergency.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T11:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T12:49:25.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
