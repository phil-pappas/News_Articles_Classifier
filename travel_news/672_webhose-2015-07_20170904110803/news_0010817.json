Photographer's Note \nThe Acropolis : is an ancient citadel located on a high rocky outcrop above the city of Athens and contains the remains of several ancient buildings of great architectural and historic significance, the most famous being the Parthenon. While there is evidence that the hill was inhabited as far back as the fourth millennium BC, it was Pericles (c. 495 Â– 429 BC) in the fifth century BC who coordinated the construction of the site's most important buildings including the Parthenon, the Propylaia, the Erechtheion and the temple of Athena Nike.The Parthenon and the other buildings were seriously damaged during the 1687 siege by the Venetians in the Morean War when the Parthenon was being used for gunpowder storage and was hit by a cannonball. ps:This information is taken from wikipedia. \nNobody has marked this note useful", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T05:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T08:10:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
