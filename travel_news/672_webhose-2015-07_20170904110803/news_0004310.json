As proof of its resilience, the analysis shows that the sector’s growth—whether in terms of global air passenger traffic, occupancy rates or international arrivals—tends to return to trend quickly after a shock.\nSecond, countries performing more strongly on the TTCI are those that are better prepared to capture the opportunities of new trends: growing demand from emerging and developing countries; the differing preferences of travellers from aging populations and a new generation of younger travellers; and the growing importance of online services and marketing, especially through mobile internet.\nThird, developing the Travel &Tourism sector provides growth opportunities and social benefits for all countries, regardless of their wealth. Several developing and emerging economies are ranked among the 50 most T&T competitive economies. A strong T&T sector translates into job opportunities at all skill levels.\nFourth, the development of the Travel &Tourism industry is complex, requiring inter-ministerial coordination and often international and public-private partnerships to overcome financial, institutional and organizational bottlenecks.\nRelated Posts BOC Aviation Marks 20th Year With Record Net Profit in 2013 Preferred Hotel Gruop Announces 2013 Results Utah lost $33 million in tourism due to shutdown Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium New VisitScotland data reveals regional visitor trends for 2012", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T05:22:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
