So goes the slightly terrifying unofficial slogan for the Mount Marathon Race, a headlong scramble up and down the peak that looms over the tiny port town of Seward, Alaska. \nIt started - where else? - in a bar-room. More than a century ago, prospectors wagered they could go up and down within an hour. They didn't succeed, but in 1915 the bet was recreated on Independence Day and has run most years since. Its fame has gathered momentum over the years, with spectators now swelling the town’s population to about 10 times its normal size. \nThe root of its notoriety is simple. Comprising a route of around 3.1 miles, the race is unfeasibly steep. Its gradients reach 60 per cent which, combined with treacherous terrain, has bred countless tales of gashes, bruises and broken limbs. \nSurprisingly, perhaps, there were no fatalities until 2012, when the last man up the mountain in that year's race disappeared. His body was never found, despite extensive searches. (See this Runner’s World article for an exhaustive, well researched account of the story). \nAlongside the rare disconcerting tale is an impressive heritage, as befits one of the oldest races in the Americas. Local legends are venerated in a low-key display outside the Seward Senior Center. There was Ephraim Kalmakoff, a resident of the local children’s home, who notched a hat-trick of victories in the early days; Cedar Bourgeois, the local girl who won seven times and now runs a café in town; and the current record holder Eric Strabel, shown careering downhill with bare torso and tree-trunk thighs. \nThe man who finished just behind him in 2013, Rickey Gates, also broke the previous record – after taking a tumble on the slopes and slotting his dislocated shoulder back into place (see 2 minutes 35 in the video below). Just another Mount Marathon Race story. 100th anniversary: would Kilian Jornet turn up? \nIn its centenary year, the race's fame – or infamy – could burst even further afield. One man's presence is creating possibly the biggest buzz ever felt in the town: Kilian Jornet. \nNever heard of him? This is the Catalan athlete who has re-written the rules of mountain running in recent years. Two years ago he ran up and down Mont Blanc in less than five hours (a record - most people take several days). He eases up mountains like Kilimanjaro and Denali like we’d go for a country stroll, and dances past rivals on steep inclines. \nLocal runners were thrilled when they spotted his name in the starting line-up but weren't sure he would appear. Now the man himself is posting images (see below) of his practice runs to his 110,000 Instagram followers. He’s there, all right. The pedigree of the Mount Marathon Race is about to be sealed by the world’s best mountain runner. His girlfriend, Emelie Forsberg, another exceptionally talented runner, is also in town, and will keep the frontrunners in the women's race on their toes. A photo posted by Kilian Jornet (@kilianjornet) on Jun 30, 2015 at 12:56pm PDT The slow ascent \nOne of those excited about Jornet’s presence is Pyper Dixon, a big-hearted local guide who finished in the top 20 last year and dreams of a top 10 finish – an achievement he fears may be beyond his reach with this year’s fiercely competitive field. \nHe took me out on a training run with some friends up Mount Marathon on a warm spring afternoon earlier this year. It started innocuously, a light jog up to the trail head – the only ominous sign was a hospital we passed en route. “Some people just run straight in when they come off the mountain,” Pyper told me. Luckier ones will pass by for a leaden-legged stumble towards the finish on Main Street. \nOnce on the trail, we began our ascent – slowly. This is the steepest section of the route, a precarious scramble over tree roots and thick branches. Another runner training for her first race got enmeshed in these gnarls and twists for several minutes, I was told as I hauled myself up. \nWe climbed higher, rising through scrub and low-slung bushes above the tree-line, the gradient easing slightly. Running was still not an option - the mountain rarely allows more than a stooped shuffle uphill, even among elite runners. \nAfter around 50 minutes' ascent, we were near the boulder at 3,022 feet that marks the mid-way point. On Independence Day, this will be decked with the Stars and Stripes; runners will turn here and fling themselves into the helter-skelter of the downhill. \nNot being on a race day schedule, we paused for a moment nearby, taking in the thrilling panorama from the town below right along the length of the Resurrection Bay. A cruise ship was moored at the port, dwarfing the salmon trawlers and tourist boats seeking a glimpse of the countless orcas, harbour seals, dolphins and humpbacks in the bay. \nMen scrambling on the scree to the race summit How to be 'an animal' on the descent \nThen we started down, firstly on our backsides down snowfields – now melted, but then still deep and cold enough to plunge my hands into acute pain after I used them to slow my slide. \nAfter patiently waiting for me to recover, Pyper cleared up a common misconception: that the slope is difficult to run on all the way down. He showed me how he would descend the ankle-deep shale on the upper and mid slopes on race day, his fluid strides surfing the shifting surface and kicking up a cloud of dust for me to eat in his wake. \nOn July 4, this may be where Kilian’s supremacy is most vulnerable: the record-holder Eric Strabel is known for his downhill prowess (\"He's an animal\" one local said) and has completed the descent in a startling 10 minutes. Pyper describes this part as a mixture of “technique and recklessness”, demonstrating a measure of both as he hop-scotched and leapt through a more testing stretch with running water and slippery wet rocks. \nThe hazardous rocks at the lower end of the mountain \nTowards the end of the trail, we came to a fork in the path. We chose the Switchback Trail to avoid the steeper cliffs and boulders – marked “extremely dangerous” on the race map – an option Pyper plans to replicate on Saturday. In 2012, one top competitor tried to used it as a shortcut down, tumbled and was seriously brain damaged. \n“I have a pretty high tolerance to recklessness,” Pyper said. “But that’s just not worth it.” \nSafely back on the road, I was in awe of those taking part in the race. More used to the green and gentle parks of London, I tip-toed down the mountain by comparison to the rest of the group. Some would say I didn't try hard enough - certainly those who live by the unofficial slogan. But I had a privileged taster of the most extreme July 4 event in America – and that was probably enough.
