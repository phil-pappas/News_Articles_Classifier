After working as a journalist for a decade, she was burnt out and took a sabbatical, which included a trip to Peru and a meeting with a medicine man. He took her on as his apprentice and taught her techniques to handle life’s challenges, which she now teaches others. I wake up naturally at about 7am. I might go swimming, do yoga or go for a walk. Then I structure my day around what’s in the diary. I work with clients in the UK and abroad, tailoring a programme to their issues and timescales. I see them in the studio or work with them over Skype. I spend the majority of my time running workshops and retreats around the world. When it comes to food, shamans believe that following our body’s physical appetites – as opposed to our emotional appetites – is the key to health. Lots of us bury our emotions in food, depriving ourselves of things we’re craving, or over-indulging. It’s important to eat with moderation. So although I tend to eat seasonally and locally, I just go with what my body requires. In summer, lunch might be a salad, but in winter it’s risotto or soup. My work could easily be 24/7 but I try to finish at 7pm. If I’m home, I meditate before bed, and I think it’s important to switch off all electrical devices a good hour before sleep.
