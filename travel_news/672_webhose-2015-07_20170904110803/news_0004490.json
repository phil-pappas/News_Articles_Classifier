Honeysuckle Gelato is just another of many offerings we’ve added recently aimed at staying true to that commitment, while offering flavors and brands customers can relate to and may not be expecting to find on board an aircraft.”\nFrom their kitchen facility on the west side of Midtown Atlanta, Smith says the same heart and soul he put into his first batch of gelato five years ago will be in every cup of Sea-Salted Caramel gelato served to Delta’s First Class customers flying at 35,000 feet.\n“Our philosophy has always been to create tasty, hand-crafted gelato and set the bar for high quality and innovation; we’re so excited to bring those flavors and that decadence to Delta’s First Class flyers,” Smith said.\nDelta in recent years has expanded its regional and seasonal options for customers on both domestic and international flights, including menus in Delta One created by partner chef Linton Hopkins and Danny Meyer as well as adding LUVO and renowned craft beers on select flights throughout the U.S.\nSource:- Delta Air Lines\nRelated Posts Atlanta bound Spirit airlines flight make emergency landing at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport Chelsea Football Club Hosts Leaders Sport Summit 2013, the world’s most Prestigious Sport Business Summit Delta to Present at Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2015 Transportation Conferenc Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building Virgin airline named top u.s. airline in conde nast traveler’s 2013 readers’ choice awards", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T22:10:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
