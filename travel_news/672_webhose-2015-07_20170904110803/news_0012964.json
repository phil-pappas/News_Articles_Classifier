(Shutterstock) Young women are reaching orgasm at a rate that’s getting competitive with that of their male counterparts, according to a US survey conducted by a condom manufacturing company.As many as 89% reported that they regularly achieve an orgasm during sex. As per the study, it could be because this generation of men and women isn’t shy about using vibrators and lubricants, with one fourth admitting to having tried the former, and 43% reporting using the latter regularly.They’re also losing their virginity at a younger age, as 83% of 18- to 24-year-olds reported having had sex before their 18th birthday. About 57% of those who participated in the survey, said that they had sexted once in their life, with 7% sexting every day, and 11% saying that they sexted several times in a week. In the survey, a total of 5,117 respondents bared all, answering 69 questions in total.
