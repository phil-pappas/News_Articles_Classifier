TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \n\"We rate EXPEDIA INC (EXPE) a BUY. This is driven by multiple strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, impressive record of earnings per share growth, compelling growth in net income, revenue growth and notable return on equity. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had generally high debt management risk by most measures that we evaluated.\" \nYou can view the full analysis from the report here: EXPE Ratings Report", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T23:56:18.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
