Brazil has the region’s largest economy.\nThe average growth level for the countries of the region is the worst since a 1.3 percent decline in 2009.\nAn external factor fueling the stagnation in Latin America and the Caribbean is slow world economic growth in 2015, in particular in China and other emerging economies, except for India, the report said.\nThis global sluggishness has sapped prices for commodities, which are the engine for economic growth in Latin America and the Caribbean, the report added.\nAt home, a drop in investment along with slower growth in consumption are among factors reducing domestic demand.\nThe U.N. agency said the regional deceleration will have the greatest impact on the countries of South America, which will suffer a contraction of 0.4 percent.\nCentral America and Mexico will grow 2.8 percent and the Caribbean will see its output rise by 1.7 percent.\nRead ECLAC’s briefing paper here", "external_links": ["http://repositorio.cepal.org/handle/11362/38715", "http://www.cepal.org/en/pressreleases/latin-america-and-caribbean-will-grow-just-05-2015"], "published": "2015-07-30T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T00:20:53.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
