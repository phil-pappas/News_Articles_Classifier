The Media Centre of Dubai Festivals and Retail Establishment (DFRE) spoke to experts and leading restaurants in Dubai to get a sense of how Eid impacts their business. \"With Dubai becoming a popular family destination during Eid holidays restaurants performed well during the Eid Al Fitr holidays\" said Thaer Sakr Hospitality expert and CEO of 1765 Hospitality management consultancy. \"The domestic tourism from within the UAE as well as tourism arrivals from overseas increased which also reflected on the F&B sector\" he said. Elias Chabtini the CEO of Y by Yabani restaurant said: \"As Eid celebrations will be followed immediately by Dubai Summer Surprises the number of visitors to Dubai is expected to increase. Restaurants are now looking ahead to a successful season to follow up on the sharp increase in bookings by families from across GCC region. We launched a special Eid promotion offering 20 per cent discount on our menu for the three days of Eid.\" Celebrity chef Silvena Rowe who runs Omnia Gourmet said that the holy month of Ramadan and the 'Eid in Dubai - Eid Al Fitr\" celebrations create a busy time for restaurants who launch special menus and offers. \"We use mostly locally sourced Emirati ingredients and for example our special menu during Ramadan was the most truly Emirati menu to be had with the food being prepared in the most ethical and cleanest of easy avoiding heavy foods such as ghee salt oil fats sugar etc\". We want to introduce truly delicious and inviting beautiful Emirati food like no one has done before\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T18:00:57.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
