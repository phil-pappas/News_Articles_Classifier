'Volcanic ash is kind of like grit or sandpaper,' said John Hansman, a professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT, as reported by AccuWeather .\n'If it goes into the engines and is the right size, it can cause the engines to shut down.'\nHe said if when ash is sucked into the engines, it is melted by the heat of the engine.The melted ash then coats the inside of the engine, ultimately leading to engine failure.\nAnother cause concern is the fact volcanic ash is actually highly abrasive and can scratch and erode plastic, glass and metals.\nIf the cockpit windows become scratched, pilots can have increasing difficulty seeing the runways and landing the plane safely.\nBut authorities said that no evacuations were necessary as those living in the area were already a safe distance away.\nVirgin Australia said in a statement that 'our team of meteorologists continue to work closely with the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre in Darwin and monitor the situation.\n'Once conditions improve, additional flights will be scheduled between Australia and Denpasar to ensure we can have guests on their way as soon as possible.'\nJetstar also grounded its services and asked passengers to contact them for further information.\nThe two Australian carriers had already cancelled flights in and out of Bali in recent days due to the volcanic ash, even before the airport was fully closed.\nAir New Zealand said that a flight due to depart from Bali on Saturday afternoon had been rescheduled to leave early Sunday, conditions permitting.\nOther airports closed by the ash included a second, smaller one on Lombok and two in East Java serving domestic routes.\nIndonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, a belt of seismic activity running around the basin of the Pacific Ocean, and has around 130 active volcanoes.\nIndonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, a belt of seismic activity running around the basin of the Pacific Ocean, and has around 130 active volcanoes\nRead more: Volcanic Eruptions and Air Travel: What Happens When a Plane Flies Through an Ash Plume?", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1LZolzE", "http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/volcano-ash-plume-eruption-airplane-engines-shutdown-flight-cancellations/46653049"], "published": "2015-07-10T13:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T01:23:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
