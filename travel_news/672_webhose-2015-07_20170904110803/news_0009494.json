(Photo: RJ Matyas) \n(As told by RJ Matyas to Sophie Forbes) \nJavier and I met in Rio De Janeiro on March 8, 2011. It was in the middle of Carnival week, and I went to this massive pool party by myself. There were thousands of people there, but somehow our eyes met. I started talking to one of his friends, when Javier walked over and introduced himself. “Hi, I’m Javier,” he said. “Do you have a boyfriend?” We hit it off right away and ended up talking all night. \nJavier was so charming. In fact, we ended up having our first kiss that night at the pool party. People always jokingly ask if there are fireworks when two people share their first kiss, but in our case there actually were! As we kissed, the DJ was playing Katy Perry’s Fireworks AND actual fireworks started to go off above us in the sky. If that’s not a sign, I don’t know what is! \nRelated: They Met in Costa Rica, Fell in Love in Rome, and Eloped to Antarctica \nAt the time, Javier was a Spanish citizen living London, and I am an American who was planning a move to Hawaii to start a new job. But the distance didn’t keep us apart. We sent messages back and forth, and just a week after we left Brazil, we managed to meet up again in Ireland. I had planned a trip with my mom, and Javier decided to fly over from London for a quick visit. He ended up spending the entire 10 days with us. \nThe couple dated long distance for three years. (Photo: RJ Matyas) \nFor the next three years we were in a long-distance relationship, and every three months we would meet in a different country. Some of our memorable trips include visits to Hawaii, London, Thailand, France, Spain, New York, Los Angeles, and Miami. When we couldn’t meet somewhere, we kept in touch through FaceTime, Skype, and Whats app. \nDuring one FaceTime call we started to explore the idea of marriage. Javier couldn’t legally live in the US, so we were brainstorming ways that we could be together. After getting denied twice for a visa, I asked him over Skype if he would enter into a civil union with me. It was a pretty weak proposal, but thankfully he said yes! Ultimately, when gay marriage became legal, a wedding wasn’t just about bringing our family together and showing our commitment, it was also the way for us to actually be together and live together in the same country. \nAs I kid I watched my older sister get married, and ever since then I knew I wanted a big celebration. We wanted to choose a destination where Spanish was spoken because the majority of Javier’s family doesn’t speak English. So, since it’s halfway between Hawaii and Spain, we chose to get married at Playa de Carmen in Mexico. \nDuring this photo, the rings fell out of the a groomsman’s pocket. It took the bridal party 15 minutes to find them! (Photo: RJ Matyas) \nTo truly represent our courtship, Javier and I decided to incorporate details from our travels into the day. Each aspect of the day meant something —from the food and music to the table decor and flowers. \nDuring the cocktail hour, we decided to pay homage to the place we met and served a signature cocktail popular in Brazil —a caipirinha, along with Brazilian tapas. \nThe table settings were all themed, based on a destination where we met during our long-distance relationship. We had a Paris table decorated with Eiffel Towers, and a New York City table dressed with little taxi cabs as the name card holder. For Thailand we had Buddha’s, and to represent Los Angeles we had the Hollywood sign and little movie cameras. \nRelated: Love Floats: We Met on a Boat in the Pacific Ocean \nDuring the ceremony, I’ll never forget the moment I walked down the aisle with my mom. Looking into the faces of all of the people there to support us was overwhelming. It made all of the planning and stress worthwhile. \nWe chose to say traditional vows and had our fist kiss as a married couple as the sun began to set. It didn’t feel real. I kept thinking in my head, “This can’t be real!” It was so amazing! \nRJ and Javier waited three years for this moment…and it was worth the wait! (Photo: RJ Matyas) \nAfter spending time in the heat, we decided to spend our honeymoon in chilly, but beautiful Whistler, Canada. It was the perfect opportunity to reflect on our journey of love and memories from the wedding. \nBut it wasn’t just about bringing together our friends and family. It wasn’t just about getting married to the man I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. For us, our wedding meant finally being able to be a gay married couple and being able to have the same sort of wedding that anyone else could have. \nWe got our picture perfect, fantasy destination wedding — it could not have been more flawless. It was the perfect testament to how hard we fought to be together. \nLet Yahoo Travel inspire you every day. Hang out with us on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , and Pinterest.
