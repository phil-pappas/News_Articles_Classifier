The other side of Yosemite — the other 99 percent of the more than 1,100 square miles of pristine, and mostly people-free, Sierra Nevada wilderness — is almost exclusively the domain of backpackers. Almost, but not completely.\nFrom the east, out of Bridgeport, travelers can get right up to the back side of Yosemite without ever lifting a pack. Halfway between Bridgeport and Mono Lake, Virginia Lakes Road traces a ridge west into a quiet, lake-filled valley with easy access to the backcountry of Yosemite and the adjacent Hoover Wilderness.\nYou hardly have to leave your car to see three postcard-worthy lakes — Trumbull Lake, Little Virginia Lake and Big Virginia Lake — in quick succession. A day hike will take you past eight lakes in a matter of a few miles up to Virginia Pass, with views over the back door of Yosemite National Park to the west and Mono Lake to the southeast. Crowded vista points? Not here.\nWhy now? The season is short in the eastern Sierra in anticipation of snows and road closures. Virginia Lakes Resort and nearby campgrounds close for the season in early October. During the peak of summer, crowds will be a fraction of what you find in Yosemite Valley; the low season, which really kicks in just after Labor Day, is even better. You may get some chilly nights, but the light crowds and the early autumn colors more than compensate.\nBackstory: For a place in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada, a range that hasn’t been enjoying much in the way of rain in recent years, the Virginia Lakes valley is still surprisingly water-rich. During the summer months, fishermen line the lakes at dawn and dusk and float the depths during the day.\nEven in the early 1900s, Virginia Lakes was a known fishing destination, but had no facilities or even a passable road until Walter and Anita Foster arrived from Los Angeles in the mid-1920s with dreams of creating a resort. Because of the Fosters’ ties to the movie industry (their dog, Muggs, was something of a canine movie star), celebrities such as Lon Chaney , Fred MacMurray and Betty White vacationed at the resort that the Fosters built over the course of many years. The glory may have faded from the aging Virginia Lakes Resort, but the destination remains a star.\nChecking in: Clean, comfy cabins and a friendly staff can be found at nearby Virginia Creek Settlement, as well as tent cabins, and two covered wagons for history buffs with sleeping bags. It’s also the closest accommodation to Bodie State Historic Park, well worth a visit.\nTo stay right at the end of the road by Virginia Lakes, visitors can choose between the historic (and very, very rustic) Virginia Lakes Resort or the idyllic Trumbull Lake Campground. Retro motor-court motel fans will find an array of choices in Bridgeport, less than 30 minutes away.\nSpend your day: Get acclimated with a visit to the ghost town of Bodie, then spend the afternoon paddling with the beavers around Trumbull Lake. Reserve the second day for a hike or horseback ride from Virginia Lakes toward the eastern boundary of Yosemite National Park, one of the finest High Sierra trail excursions you can do without packing in.\nDining: The restaurant at the Virginia Creek Settlement dishes up classic American breakfasts, and good pizzas and Italian fare for dinner. For a higher-end dining experience and sunset views over Mono Lake, head to the Historic Mono Inn near Lee Vining.\nDon’t bother: Hoofing it all the way into Yosemite National Park on a day hike if you’re not up for it: The High Sierra beauty starts well before you reach the park boundary. Even a short hike or horseback ride will transport you into high alpine country few ever see.\nWord to the wise: Resist the temptation to hit the trail right away, especially if you’re coming from sea level. Virginia Lakes sits at 9,600 feet, and the trail over Virginia Pass hits nearly 12,000. Give yourself a day to get acclimated, and carry plenty of water on any hike.\nAndy Murdock is a freelance writer in Alameda.
