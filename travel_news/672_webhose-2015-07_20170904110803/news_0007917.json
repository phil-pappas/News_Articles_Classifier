Guided by Dîner en Blanc volunteers, these groups will then converge on one of the city's most beautiful settings, which is revealed only when guests arrive. Every guest brings their own gourmet feast, table, chairs and table setting. Over the course of the evening, they will eat and celebrate amid music, entertainment and dancing. \nCelebrity will reveal a number of exciting event experiences to Le Dîner en Blanc attendees at events in Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, and Washington DC in 2015. The sponsorship also offers Le Dîner en Blanc members in those cities the opportunity to enter a sweepstakes to win a seven-night Celebrity cruise for two to the Caribbean. Celebrity is also providing the prize for a contest for Dîner en Blanc attendees in those cities and additional U.S. cities, which includes submission of a photo of the attendee's 2015 Dîner en Blanc table setting and design, which will be judged by Dîner en Blanc on style, creativity, and elegance. The winner will receive the ultimate modern luxury escape: a grand prize of a 10-11-night Celebrity cruise for two in Europe plus roundtrip, coach-class airfare from a major US gateway, and $250 onboard credit. \n\"We are incredibly excited that Celebrity Cruises is bringing its modern luxury dynamic to our guests in these very special cities,\" said Sandy Safi, Co-Founder, Dîner en Blanc International. \"Not only is Celebrity giving our guests opportunities to win cruises on their beautiful ships, but they are also bringing some unique touches to our events. We look forward to a continued relationship with Celebrity as a result of this year's activations.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T22:01:45.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
