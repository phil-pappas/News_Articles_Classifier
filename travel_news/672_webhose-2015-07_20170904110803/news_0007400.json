If the thought of doing yet more lengths at the local swimming pool or scrabbling around for a quid for the locker leaves you with that sinking feeling about your regular dip, it’s time you took your Speedos somewhere new. Wild or open swimming is currently enjoying a new wave of interest in the UK. That back-to-nature vibe means many of us are waving the foot bath at our gym pool goodbye, and bobbing up in the nation’s rivers, lakes and coastline instead. With wild swimming’s inbuilt sense of freedom and adventure, it’s easy to see why the sport is taking off. However, swimming in the wild is a little more risky than the pool, and you need to take some basic precautions before you throw yourself in. Always avoid anywhere with a fast-flowing current or strong tides. Never dive in anywhere without knowing what’s below, and be extra careful near waterfalls and plunge pools. In most cases, outdoor water is going to be colder than you’re used to in a heated pool – and this might have an impact on how confident you feel in the water. If you want to wear a wetsuit rather than just trunks, that’s fine and probably even sensible. So, now that you’re pumped up and ready to swim – where’s best to go? Lakes If you’re keen to swim in a lake, there’s (obviously) nowhere better than the Lake District. The area’s major lakes – Coniston Water, Ullswater and Windermere – are all popular locations for wild swimming. For a quieter spot with fewer boats, try Buttermere, Grasmere and Wast Water. Snowdonia’s Lake Bala is said to be the place to go for the deepest and clearest water in Wales. And if you fear you-know-who might be lurking below the dark waters of Loch Ness, an alternative is Loch Lomond – a popular spot for wild swimmers north of the border. Open swimming locations can also be found in urban settings. The Serpentine in Hyde Park is a popular spot all year round. Rivers Cutting through the water in some of our best-known rivers has a huge allure too, and Grantchester Meadows on Cambridge’s River Cam is regarded as an idyllic spot. Other scenic swims include The Wharfe in the Yorkshire Dales where you pass by the ruins of Bolton Abbey. Barcombe Mills on the River Ouse in East Sussex is popular too. Coast As for beautiful beaches and secluded coves, every county with a coast has its own special places. The Outdoor Swimming Society has an online map of the best wild swimming spots in the UK, with hundreds flagged up on our coastline. Unsurprisingly, some of the real gems are in Cornwall, Devon and Dorset. In Northumberland, Embleton Bay, which is overlooked by the ruins Dunstanburgh Castle, gets a big thumbs up. But even the less-trumpeted places on our shoreline offer endless possibilities to both the new and more experienced wild swimmer.
