The park’s monorail was out of action for an hour - with 80 people stuck inside – while the Air rollercoaster also temporarily stopped, leaving riders stuck in mid-air, upside down, for 20 minutes. No injuries were reported. The incidents come just weeks after the Smiler rollercoaster crashed into an empty carriage, injuring 16 passengers – some seriously. A spokesman for Alton Towers told the BBC that the delays were “within expected levels” and that the monorail would reopen today. @altontowers we're currently stuck on the monorail melting. Can you please let us out? #sweating #needaircon — Leanne Rudd (@leelar22) July 1, 2015 Two monorail trains broke down at around 5.30pm. It took guests an hour to exit the ride using evacuation walkways. \"The train drivers kept guests informed via the onboard PA system and refreshments were provided,\" the spokesman said. The Air rollercoaster experienced problems earlier in the afternoon. Alton Towers said the ride was cleared “within standard operating procedures”. second ride to close today and loads of people stranded on Air #epicfail #altontowers pic.twitter.com/m0t4WQC7Ek — Sarah Chapman (@sechapman02) July 1, 2015 The timing couldn’t have been much worse for riders, with Britain sweltering in the hottest July day on record.
