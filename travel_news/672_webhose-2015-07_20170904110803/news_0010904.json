Time passes, so it was surprising to realise reading Christopher Howse’s celebration of the Telegraph’s 160 year anniversary last week that its vivid reporting of the newsworthy stretches all the way back to when Florence Nightingale was ministering to the wounded of the Crimean war. It was almost more surprising to realise that my contributions to the paper now span almost a fifth of its existence. The most striking feature perhaps of the past 30 years is how, reassuringly, the predictions by medical experts anticipating the dire consequences of, variously, Chickengate (salmonella poisoning from eggs), BSE ('mad cow disease’), SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), swine flu and several others - have consistently failed to materialise. They all share to a greater or lesser extent, certain features in common: the source of the supposed threat must be something universal to which almost everyone might be exposed – whether eating eggs or beef or their vulnerability to some novel infectious agent. Next, while the scientific basis for the threat might be real enough it contains a powerful element of uncertainty and the call for drastic action to curtail it are invariably predicated on a massive over estimation of the numbers that might be affected. The final toll, though serious in its way, turns out to be much more modest – 457 fatalities from swine flu, 164 from BSE and just 6 from SARS. This brings us to the most recent, and indeed the mother of all such scenarios, global warming with a lengthy report from an international commission of 42 prominent academics published last week claiming that climate change 'poses the biggest global health threat of the 21st century ’. Specifically, that its effects could be directly responsible for a quarter of a million fatalities over the next decade and a half. Their deliberations are certainly intended to convey the impression of having thoroughly and judiciously scrutinised the relevant scientific evidence, buttressed by numerous tables and diagram s and more than 300 references But it is a real shocker without a hint of acknowledgement of the genuine uncertainties over global temperature trends or the validity of their methods of statistical modelling. Rather climate change, it is argued , will be a major contributory factor to every conceivable misfortune; extreme weather events (heat waves, storms, forest fires and droughts), agricultural losses and changing patterns of disease. They could be right of course, but it would seem more likely their predictions will prove to be no more accurate than all those other doomsday scenarios of the past three decades. Getty images Doctors are the worse patients For all the self evident importance of promptly investigating potentially serious symptoms, there is perhaps a natural tendency to prevaricate with even the best informed being prone to self deception. When Professor Blair-Smith, specialist in pain medicine at Dundee’s Ninewells Hospital first noted painless bleeding from the bowel, he was, he felt, 'far too busy’ to consult his family doctor and reluctant to undergo the intimate physical examination required to clarify what might be amiss. Most probably, he convinced himself, it was just haemorrhoids or something similar that would just get better. Several months elapsed before being goaded into action by an imaginary conversation he found himself having with a hypothetical patient in a similar situation seeking his advice on what he should do. The answer was obvious but even when booked in for the inevitable colonoscopy he anticipated it would not reveal any sinister cause of the bleeding. It did, of course – a nasty looking tumour that during his several months of procrastinating had spread to the local lymph nodes – warranting both major surgery and chemotherapy. He remains 'puzzled and bewildered’ at his folly at denying the obvious – that for anyone like himself in his mid fifties, the cause of painless bleeding from the bowel must be presumed to be a tumour – until shown to be otherwise. That self deception he suspects might be not unusual and hopefully his experience will encourage others to act sooner than later. Alamy This week's conundrum This week’s medical query comes courtesy of Mr WG from Bath who finds that perspiration under the arms and across the chest stains his clothing with a greenish hue - resistant to biological detergents and high temperature washes. He initially suspected that his deodorant might be the culprit but the discolouration persists despite switching brands. He is currently spending a fortune buying new vests from M&S and would welcome any suggestions as to what the explanation might be.
