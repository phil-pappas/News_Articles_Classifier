Palm Beach Gardens, FL, July 05, 2015 --( PR.com )-- Employers worried about the health of their employees, rising costs, and lost time from work are taking advantage of AngioScreen, a heart attack- or stroke-prevention technology developed by Angiology Corporation of America, a sponsor of the World Medical Tourism & Global Healthcare Congress, Sept. 27-30, 2015, in Orlando, Fla., the Medical Tourism Association® announced today.AngioScreen, a non-invasive, non-diagnostic ultrasound ultrasound technology, targets heart rhythms, circulation, risk of heart disease, neck and leg arteries, blood pressure, and personal fitness to give a much clearer picture of an individual’s vascular health.“More employers are looking to improve the quality of life for their employees and manage the number of insurance claims, which, in turn, may result in lower healthcare costs,” said Renée-Marie Stephano, President of the Medical Tourism Association®. “Healthcare costs and productivity at work is not only an issue in the United States, but a concern of all employers throughout the world who want what’s best for both their employees and their businesses.”Stephano said that the screening technique could ultimately provide potential medical tourism patients an assessment of risk that can be reviewed and enhanced through consultation with a local physician prior to traveling abroad for treatment.Vascular disease or atherosclerosis, the leading cause of heart attacks or strokes, is caused by severe plague buildup along the artery walls. About 610,000 people die of heart disease in the United States each year – that’s one in every four deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The AngioScreen technology, although it does not take the place of a comprehensive exam, enables both physicians and patients to identify risks and tackle the disease early.The World Medical Tourism & Global Healthcare Congress attracts some 3,000 key stakeholders – hospital administrators, doctors and clinicians, employers, government policy makers, insurance executives, facilitators, and hospitality and tourism interests – from across the globe to share their experiences and identify and solve issues that bear significantly on the industry.
