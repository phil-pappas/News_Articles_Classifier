Palm Beach Gardens, FL, July 03, 2015 --( PR.com )-- The Medical Tourism Association® has partnered with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to provide a traveler’s guide to preventing and treating illness and injury abroad – 2016 CDC Yellow Book.“There are so many factors - some you have heard of, some you are unaware of - that can influence a decision to seek medical tourism,” said Renée-Marie Stephano, President of the Medical Tourism Association®. “The CDC Yellow Book is one avenue in which anyone who provides medical tourism services -- hospital administrators and staff, doctors, human resources professionals, government officials and travel and hospitality interests – can use to identify trends, important protocols and reference practical advice to give to their clients.”Updated biennially, the Yellow Book contains detailed, destination-specific advice for pre-travel precautions and in-country solutions: a must-have for medical tourism professionals in today’s globalized world of healthcare. Publications and outreach – like the 8th World Medical Tourism & Global Healthcare Congress, Sept. 27-30, 2015, in Orlando, Fla. – are great ways to promote industry awareness and circulate education related to the risks and benefits of travel abroad.
