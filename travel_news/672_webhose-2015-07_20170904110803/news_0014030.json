Photo: YouTube/ROUND III MEDIA \nAcrobatics, selfie-sticks and even back-flips on bicycles are on display in this slow-motion, highly-stylised video that features a lot of high-fives and even a cute puppy. \nBSR Cable Park is located in Waco, Texas. Construction of The Royal Flush water slide was completed in April. \nAn all day Royal Flush pass costs $US15 (NZ$22) and riders must be at least six years old.
