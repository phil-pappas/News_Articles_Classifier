It is essential that businesses deal with such matters correctly, otherwise they will lose any potential claims made against them. Business owners or managers should be aware that defending even a relatively simple employment tribunal case could mean paying out around £25,000 in legal costs and, in complicated cases, considerably more. And this doesn’t take into consideration the disruption, distraction and stress that such a situation can cause. With that in mind, it is quite alarming to see how often businesses make a complete mess of the disciplinary process. You must conduct a fair, thorough and impartial investigation to establish all the facts available Whilst it is true to say that the volume of employment tribunal claims has dropped recently, the nature of employment tribunals has also changed. They are now quasi courts, presided over by judges and, as a result, the bar has gone up quite a few notches, placing a greater burden on the employer to prove that they have acted reasonably throughout in reaching their decision. Whilst it is not a criminal court, employers need to be aware that the way that they have conducted a disciplinary process will be under great scrutiny. As in many areas of law, the court will apply a test based on previous case law. In employment cases the standard test is “The Burchell Test”. Dating from 1978, this case remains the most important test when determining unfair dismissal for misconduct. The test asks three simple questions: • Does the employer actually believe that the employee was guilty of misconduct? • Has the employer reasonable grounds upon which to base that belief? • Has the employer carried out as much investigation as was reasonable in the circumstances of the case? While points one and two are pretty straightforward, it is imperative that you comply with point three and conduct a thorough and objective investigation to establish the facts of the case before you proceed to a disciplinary hearing. This aspect of the process is one that employers frequently get wrong and it is one of the first things that the judge will inspect, should you reach tribunal. It is vitally important to conduct a fair, thorough and impartial investigation to establish all of the facts that are available. The investigation should include accurate reports, and all interview notes should be fact-based and contemporaneous to show that you have conducted a fair investigation. You should also ensure that the investigation is done as quickly as possible, while things are still “fresh in the mind”. Once complete, and if you proceed to a disciplinary hearing, then you must follow a disciplinary procedure consistent with ACAS guidelines (you can access and download the code here). You must follow this process, ensuring employees are informed correctly in writing as to what they are being disciplined for; that they have at least two full working days’ notice of the hearing; that they be allowed representation (either a work colleague or trade union representative); that they be given copies of the evidence to be used in the hearing; and that they be informed what the possible outcome could be. The disciplinary chairperson must evaluate all of the evidence, listen to the employee’s explanation and consider any mitigation before reaching a decision. Work history, general conduct and disciplinary records should be taken into account. When making a decision, do not inform the employee during the meeting or adjourn the meeting for a short period and then call the employee back in. This is someone’s livelihood at stake, and you should properly consider everything before reaching your decision. You should spend at least a day – ideally no more than two – before you inform the employee of your decision. Whatever the decision, the employee has a right of appeal. This must be given to them in writing with the tribunal’s decision as soon as possible after the decision has been given. The watchword in all employment matters is reasonableness. When deciding upon an employee’s future, you must consider what another reasonable employer would have done in similar circumstances, faced with the same situation. • Protect your business with the right company car financed the best way for you.
