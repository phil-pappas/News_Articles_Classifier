That is a complicated acronym for a very flexible and useful financial vehicle. It also offers one of the few occasions in life when you can get money from the Government. A Sipp is a place you can keep a range of different assets, all of which you have chosen. Traditional pensions often limited the types of investments you can make. A Sipp, on the other hand, gives you a wider choice and lets you decide what assets you go for. Those assets can include funds, shares, bonds, cash and, in some cases, commercial property. If you don’t have cash to invest, you could move money from an existing pension scheme into a Sipp A Sipp not only holds these for you – possibly on an online platform – but also shelters them from the taxman. If your investments grow in value or produce income, you owe no capital gains tax or income tax as long as they remain in the Sipp. There is, however, something even more cheerful about a Sipp. When you pay money into it, the Government gives you money. Depending on what tax rate you are on, your contribution could attract as much as 45 per cent tax relief. If you don’t have cash to invest, you could consider moving money from an existing pension scheme into a Sipp. Before doing this, you need to check with your existing pension scheme provider. Ask if there are penalties for withdrawal. In some cases it may be too expensive to take money out. It is a good idea to seek guidance from an independent financial adviser before withdrawing money. Investing and running a Sipp is something for the more sophisticated investor - for people who are comfortable making their own decisions. Seeking advice is essential, but if you decide a Sipp is for you there is a huge range of choice and flexibility.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T23:19:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
