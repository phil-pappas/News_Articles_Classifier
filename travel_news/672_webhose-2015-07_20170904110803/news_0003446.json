Along the way I’d been severely scolded by more than one chattering red grouse, and ignored by innumerable flocks of grazing sheep. Eventually I’d made it all the way to Top Withens, a ruined farmhouse whose setting was said to have been the inspiration for Emily Brontë’s “Wuthering Heights.” Sunburned and tired after the long walk, I needed refreshment.\nI found it in the Fleece, an old pub in the Brontës’ Yorkshire hometown, Haworth: a half-pint (9.6 ounces) of Golden Best, a mild ale from the local brewer Timothy Taylor. Served with almost no carbonation from a traditional hand pump, the beer was refreshingly bitter and just sweet enough to renew my energy.\nBetter still, the small portion and the beer’s relatively low alcohol — just 3.5 percent — meant that I could sample it again, or try any one of several delicious alternatives.\nContinue reading the main story Slide Show Slide Show | 9 Photos Exploring Yorkshire, One Pub at a Time Exploring Yorkshire, One Pub at a Time Credit Andy Haslam for The New York Times\n“Everybody in the know drinks halves,” said Leigh Linley, author of “Great Yorkshire Beer,” when I met him in the nearby city of Leeds the next day, referring to the half-pint serving glass, instead of the more traditional imperial pint. “With the amount of choice we have in Yorkshire, it is perfectly acceptable to drink halves and treat each night out as a giant beer festival.”\nIndeed, I’d heard for years about the pleasures of Yorkshire beer, starting with storied ale breweries like Samuel Smith’s, founded in 1758, and Timothy Taylor, founded a century later. In addition to traditional English ales, the county is also home to up-and-coming craft breweries that produce more modern styles, as well as some of Britain’s ’s most beloved pubs and bars.\nArmed with Mr. Linley’s book, I decided to take a six-day trip across much of West, South and North Yorkshire this spring, and soak up a sense of this northern English county and its renowned beer culture.\nI’d found Haworth almost impossibly pretty, both in my walks on the surrounding moors and in the village itself. Like much of the area, it has quieted down since its Victorian-era heyday, when textile mills flourished in Yorkshire. Since then, Haworth has become a storybook vacation destination, best known for its connection to the Brontës, its old stone cottages and pubs like the Fleece.\nPhoto A half-pint of Timothy Taylor's Golden Best ale.

I enjoyed my half of Boltmaker, a bitter ale carrying the pub’s name, though, unlike at other taverns in the region, the locals didn’t seem very friendly.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Back at the station, I boarded another train for a quick ride to the Victorian town of Saltaire, where the spacious stone halls of the town’s disused textile mill housed a huge exhibit dedicated to the Yorkshire-born painter David Hockney.\nAfter an afternoon with the art and some downtime on the lawn of Saltaire’s sprawling park — originally built for the health and well-being of the mill workers — I was ready for a more urbane setting. Another short ride took me to Leeds, where I met up with Mr. Linley, who walked with me to a few of his favorite pubs and offered advice on what to see in his city over the next few days.\nWhat I found turned out to be one of the best beer-drinking destinations I’d visited in Europe, a friendly and undertouristed city of about 750,000 inhabitants — large enough to be interesting, though still walkable. Moreover, the local beer scene has exploded. With Mr. Linley, I visited a new brewpub, Tapped, with over two dozen modern craft beers, and the recently rejuvenated Whitelock’s, which calls itself the oldest pub in Leeds, celebrating its 300th anniversary this year.\nPhoto A steam locomotive at the Keighley rail station. Credit Andy Haslam for The New York Times On my own, I tried out the upscale Friends of Ham, which focuses on craft brews and high-end charcuterie, allowing guests to pair four-year-old, acorn-fed Ibérico Bellota ham from Spain with a fragrant, West Coast-style IPA from West Yorkshire’s Magic Rock brewery, or to contrast the flavors of fennel-flavored finocchiona sausage from Tuscany with a chocolate chipotle stout from the nearby Ilkley Brewery.\nJust around the corner, I found another new craft beer bar, Bundobust, which eschews meat entirely, instead offering craft brews with a menu of vegetarian Indian street food. Sipping a half of Bundobust’s house brew, a coriander-infused Pilsner, I found myself wishing that more pubs served spicy okra fries and onion bhaji with tangy tamarind chutney as bar snacks.\nMy two days in Leeds included a number of modern taverns and extremely up-to-date craft brews, but I wanted to find out more about Yorkshire’s most traditional breweries, and what it was that made the half-pints of old-style bitter and mild so delicious. Magic Rock’s IPAs were good, but I could hardly tell one from the other, and all of them seemed to be imitations of American beers, while the bitters and milds felt as much a part of the region as the moors and the old textile mills.\nWhen I had emailed Timothy Taylor to request a tour, the response came back that they do not offer tours, instead suggesting that I visit the Black Sheep brewery in the remote North Yorkshire village of Masham. And so, after 42 minutes on a high-speed train to the town of Thirsk and a 15-minute taxi ride across beautiful North Yorkshire farmland, I arrived at the Black Sheep brewery just as a tour was beginning. The brewery, I learned, had opened in 1992, when one of the Theakstons had split from the local Theakston brewery, starting a second major beer producer in a town of just over a thousand inhabitants.\nPhoto Cobbled street in Haworth, the town where Emily Brontë's family lived.

Other tourgoers were clearly fans, and a number of guests were drinking and dining in the airy, on-site restaurant. The hourlong tour showed off the historic building — originally part of Lightfoot’s, another local beer producer — where the new Black Sheep brewery had been built. There was also a focus on the unusual fermenting vessels, called Yorkshire squares. Despite the name, most of them were round, roughly the size of a small aboveground swimming pool, with an upper chamber that allowed the fermenting liquid to drain through a hole in its “deck,” or floor, into a second chamber. Every three hours for three days, our guide explained, the fermenting beer in the lower chamber was pumped through a “rouser” onto the upper level for six minutes. The fermenters themselves were open on top, allowing the fruity scent of yeast to fill the room.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story The result, I realized, must be why the traditional milds and bitters from Yorkshire tasted so remarkable. Old breweries throughout Europe sing the praises of open fermenters, rather than more modern cylindroconical tanks, but the unusual process of rousing the yeast in Yorkshire squares must cause the strong local flavors.\nAfter a lunch of crispy fish and chips with malt vinegar and a half of Golden Sheep, a moderately bitter ale, in the brewery’s bistro, I walked across Masham to the storied Theakston brewery, founded in 1827. Along the way, I peeked into a greengrocer’s, housed in a hobbit-like stone building, and followed the signs to the brewery down a narrow, walled lane. At one point I caught a glimpse of a grand manor, hiding behind a lavish gated entrance. The walk had taken only 10 minutes, but the weather was overcast and chilly, leaving me too cold and tired for another tour. Instead I repaired to the on-site pub, the Black Bull in Heaven, and ordered halves of Theakston beers while warming up next to the fireplace.\nTheakston’s best bitter and XB were excellent, with more of that yeast aroma I’d noticed at the Black Sheep. But the big surprise was the brewery’s strong ale, Old Peculier, named after the Peculier of Masham, a legal district created by the Archbishop of York in the 12th century. Dark, plummy and mysteriously bitter, with 5.6 percent alcohol it was much stronger than many of the local beers, though still weaker than many American craft brews.\nPhoto Black Sheep brewery in Masham. Credit Andy Haslam for The New York Times After the two traditional breweries in Masham, I wanted to see how things were changing elsewhere in Yorkshire. After a night in the beautiful walled city of York and an afternoon in Tadcaster, Samuel Smith’s hometown, I headed down to Sheffield, the South Yorkshire manufacturing city.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story Sheffield seemed to be in transition, not quite recovered from its industrial past, including the wartime bombing that had scarred it. But the town’s two major universities gave it a youthful air, as did Sheffield’s diverse list of bands and musicians, including Joe Cocker, the Human League, Pulp, Def Leppard and the Arctic Monkeys.\nFollowing a Sheffield Ale Trail map from ourfaveplaces.co.uk , I stopped for half-pints at some the city’s best-known pubs. Along the way, I discovered several new arrivals. En route to the Devonshire Cat, a student pub, I found a year-old BrewDog bar, serving beers from the upstart Scottish brewery. Not far from the historic Rutland Arms, I had a quick half of mild at the then-four-month-old Tap and Tankard, where a bartender chatted with me about her favorite ska and soul tunes. In the Kelham Island industrial district, I paired a fancy pizza — with baked beets, Yorkshire goat cheese and pumpkin seeds — with a can of Beavertown’s outstanding Gamma Ray pale ale at Craft and Dough, which opened last December.\nIt seemed as if the city’s beer scene was almost growing too quickly. At the Kelham Island Tavern around the corner, I stopped to take a photograph at the front entrance, where I met the owner, Trevor Wraith.\n“The neighborhood has improved greatly since I opened here,” he said, noting that he’d been running it since 2002, opening it close to another destination pub, the Fat Cat. Otherwise, there hadn’t been much in the area at the time. He gestured to the vacant lots on either side. “This used to be all factories. That was a scissors factory next door until last year.”\nOne of Mr. Wraith’s regulars arrived, and they walked into the pub, leaving me to look around the neighborhood as the sun set over the warehouses. It seemed as if half the pubs I’d visited in Yorkshire were less than a year old, though others dated from the Victorian era, if not earlier. Many of the breweries I’d enjoyed were also brand new, though some of my favorites — like Samuel Smith and Theakston — had histories that could be counted in centuries. It felt like the best of a couple of different worlds.\nI shivered, feeling the chill of a spring evening. And then I went inside the pub myself, to contemplate the future of Yorkshire brewing over another half-pint or two.", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/26/travel/26YORKSHIRE6/26YORKSHIRE6-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/26/travel/26YORKSHIRE4/26YORKSHIRE4-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/26/travel/26YORKSHIRE5/26YORKSHIRE5-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/26/travel/26YORKSHIRE6/26YORKSHIRE6-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/26/travel/26YORKSHIRE5/26YORKSHIRE5-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/26/travel/26YORKSHIRE1/26YORKSHIRE1-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/26/travel/20150726YORKSHIREBEER-slide-VHIO/20150726YORKSHIREBEER-slide-VHIO-jumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/26/travel/26YORKSHIRE4/26YORKSHIRE4-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/26/travel/26YORKSHIRE1/26YORKSHIRE1-superJumbo.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-23T22:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T01:58:52.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
