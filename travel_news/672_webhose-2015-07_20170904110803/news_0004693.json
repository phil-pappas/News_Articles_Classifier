There are plenty of opportunities to get on and into the water, from paddle steamers to paddle boarding, cruising on a Tall Ship to wild swimming. Beside the river, there’s mudlarking on the foreshore and an open day at Tower Beach. Chances to get active include the 20k Thames Bridges Trek and the fishing, kayaking and boat trips at Tidefest, to the annual Source to Sea River Relay. The festival balances these with the more sedate pleasures of concerts in riverside churches, special events at Thameside attractions, a late night tryst at Chelsea Physic Garden, special offers at riverside restaurants, and a night of poetry celebrating wild swimming. \nThe program includes live art in various iterations along the entire 42-mile stretch through the capital. As well as theatre performances, kids’ choirs and a unique contemporary opera, The Lighthouse, accessed by boat at Trinity Buoy Wharf, Totally Thames is delighted to announce the premiere Bascule Chamber Concert inside Tower Bridge. The first ever public event to take place in this fascinating space, composer Iain Chambers will transform this global landmark into a giant musical instrument based on sound recordings taken inside the chambers. \nTotally Thames also brings renowned sculptor of underwater art Jason deCaires Taylor for his first ever London commission, The Rising Tide, a series of four equine sculptures installed on the foreshore at Nine Elms on the South Bank.
