Several say he drugged and raped them.\nSmithsonian spokeswoman Linda St. Thomas says the museum will install the sign Wednesday. She says the sign will essentially say the museum does not condone Cosby's behaviour.\nThe Cosby art collection features African-American artists long under-appreciated by museums.\nCourt documents have revealed Cosby admitted under oath that he obtained Quaaludes to give to women with whom he wanted to have sex.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T19:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T07:39:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
