Give or take a few plot twists – and swap Provence for the chalky downland of East Sussex – and this is a reasonable synopsis of Mark Driver’s story. After a high-flying career as a hedge fund manager, Driver found himself looking for a new direction. He bought a 600-acre arable farm and signed up for a viticulture course at Brighton University, with the aim of planting a vineyard. But any notion that this is a hobby career to ease him into retirement evaporates as we drive through the gates of the Rathfinny Estate . This place is enormous, rows of young vines unfolding in every direction as far as the eye can see.\nRathfinny is one of the UK’s largest vineyards and the plan is to produce sparkling wines of a quality to rival the finest champagne. Driver is obviously not a man to do things by halves, a fact which becomes even more apparent when we pull up outside the Flint Barns. This imposing brick and flint structure was built on the site of the original 19th-century farmhouse to house the pickers and pruners who work on the vineyard in autumn and winter. The rest of the year it will function as a posh hostel and B&B. As we walk into the lofty and light-filled dining area, with its reclaimed oak floors, exposed beams, long trestle tables and open kitchen, I’m tempted to apply for a job myself. I don’t have much experience of agricultural workers’ digs but I’m guessing this is not typical.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Flint Barn sleeps 45 guests in a mix of doubles, family rooms and bunkrooms sleeping up to eight, all with en suite bathrooms. Much to my five-year-old daughter’s delight, we’re in one of the bunkrooms. It’s compact and pared back – no wardrobe, dressing table or TV – but what it does have is all high quality: oak floors, comfortable mattresses with white cotton duvets and woollen throws, and a good shower.\nSome of the rooms look over the vineyard – I particularly liked the five-bed attic room which has views across the valley – but a few of them, including ours, look directly on to the windows of other bedrooms so you might want to keep the blinds down in the evening. There’s a little kitchen for guests’ use with tea, coffee and a fridge, and a cosy lounge which has exposed flint stone walls, large comfy sofas, a wood-burner and shelves full of books and board games. This would be the perfect bolthole for a rainy day but the sun is shining so we drop our bags and head straight for the nearest beach, which is at Seaford, a 10-minute drive away. Here, we eat fish and chips from the excellent Osbournes (14 Church Street) by the sea. Seaford is pretty sleepy but if you’re looking for excitement the bright lights (and burnt piers) of Eastbourne and Brighton are a short drive away.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest If there’s enough demand, the Flint Barns’ chef will cook supper (£20 for two courses) – an informal affair with a simple set menu and guests helping themselves from dishes on the table. The night we stay it’s sea bream, but my daughter couldn’t wait for the 7.30pm sitting so we head into Alfriston. (Incidentally, I find I cannot pass a sign for Alfriston without singing its name to the tune of Glen Campbell’s Galveston – a gag which wears very thin as the weekend unfolds.)\nThe town is sweet: tea shops, cobbled streets, ye olde inns. Nowhere to buy a spanner or a tin of beans, but that’s not going to trouble us. After a so-so meal at The George Inn we decide we’d probably have been better off eating at the Flint Barns – a suspicion that’s confirmed over a very decent full English breakfast the next morning. Our fellow guests are mostly clad in lycra: this is the perfect overnight stop for cyclists or walkers tackling the South Downs Way.\nTours of the winery and vineyard take place once a month and the first bottles of sparkling wine are expected to be available in 2018. If the quality of the accommodation is anything to go by, there’s grounds for high hopes.\n• Accommodation was provided by Flint Barns , Rathfinny Wine Estate, Alfriston, East Sussex, 01323 874 030, flintbarns.com .

Photograph: flickr • Eat\nWingrove House on the high street uses locally sourced produce for all of its classic British dishes. My favourites are the potted crab with spiced fresh mango salad, and the pan-fried fillet of organic salmon served with vegetables from a local farm – accompanied by a great wine list.\n• Shop\nDiana Kelly is a renowned interior design shop, with beautiful antiques suitable for everyone. Diana has a phenomenal eye for finding things and her eccentric window displays are the talk of the town. Also, Peppa K is a popular Scandinavian children’s clothes shop with a fresh look.\n• Sightseeing\nThe Clergy House is a 14th-century Wealden hall house with an interesting history and beautiful gardens. One of the most beautiful stretches of the South Downs Way footpath runs through Alfriston bringing many walkers to the town.\n• Coffee\nBadgers Tea House has a cult following. It serves Segafredo coffee, and a wide range of tea. The homemade gooseberry and elderflower cake is a testament to bakers Michael Luttig and Lynn Attfield. There’s also fresh dairy, and flour-free soup, accompanied by locally baked bread.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The+Flint+Barns%2C+Rathfinny+Estate%2C+Alfriston%2C+East+Sussex%3A+hotel+review&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4ayj4%2Fstw%23img-2", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=The+Flint+Barns%2C+Rathfinny+Estate%2C+Alfriston%2C+East+Sussex%3A+hotel+review&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Fjul%2F18%2Fflint-barns-rathfinny-estate-alfriston-east-sussex-hotel-review&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F7%2F16%2F1437050536287%2F7ab912e4-c1fd-431d-a3aa-90281fcdf0cb-1020x612.jpeg", "http://www.dianakellyinteriors.co.uk/", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4ayj4%2Fsfb%23img-3&ref=responsive", "http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/south-downs-way/routes", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The+Flint+Barns%2C+Rathfinny+Estate%2C+Alfriston%2C+East+Sussex%3A+hotel+review&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4ayj4%2Fstw%23img-4", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The+Flint+Barns%2C+Rathfinny+Estate%2C+Alfriston%2C+East+Sussex%3A+hotel+review&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4ayj4%2Fstw%23img-3", "http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/alfriston-clergy-house/visitor-information/", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4ayj4%2Fsfb%23img-4&ref=responsive", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=The+Flint+Barns%2C+Rathfinny+Estate%2C+Alfriston%2C+East+Sussex%3A+hotel+review&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Fjul%2F18%2Fflint-barns-rathfinny-estate-alfriston-east-sussex-hotel-review&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F7%2F16%2F1437050601483%2F6df9c908-a84c-4f19-b1ea-69790cb5d70c-1020x612.jpeg", "http://www.rathfinnyestate.com/visit/", "http://peppa-k.com/", "http://www.flintbarns.com/", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=The+Flint+Barns%2C+Rathfinny+Estate%2C+Alfriston%2C+East+Sussex%3A+hotel+review&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Fjul%2F18%2Fflint-barns-rathfinny-estate-alfriston-east-sussex-hotel-review&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F7%2F16%2F1437050852479%2F17203140475_3abbcd3eef_o-2060x1236.jpeg", "http://www.wingrovehousealfriston.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4ayj4%2Fsfb%23img-2&ref=responsive", "http://www.segafredo.it/en/", "http://www.badgersteahouse.com/home/"], "published": "2015-07-18T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T03:42:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
