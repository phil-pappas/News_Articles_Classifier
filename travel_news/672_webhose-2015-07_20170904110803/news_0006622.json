Most travelers don’t know that depending on the situation, they may be entitled to compensation. And even those who know may not want to go through an airline’s long process to get the money they deserve.\nIn steps Czech Republic-based ClaimAir , the brainchild of founder Jakub Ladra.\nBeginning in 2013, Ladra found himself doing a lot of travel. “Several times I encountered huge flight delays, as well as with a loss of my baggage. I found it easy to handle such situations but I realized that it could be damn hard and annoying for anyone who have no clue about related regulations, laws and conventions,” he said. “I did market research and found out that every year, 26 million passengers are entitled to compensations from airlines, but only less than one percent get what they deserve. It was in August 2013 when the idea of ClaimAir was born.”\nAir passengers’ rights are actually regulated by several international and national conventions, laws and regulations, not by airlines, said Ladra. These include the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Aviation Consumer Protection and Enforcement division , air passenger rights in the European Union , along with the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Air Transport Association .\n“Airlines have their contracts of carriage , but it can’t be in a direct conflict with the legislation, so there is generally no need to find out any airlines’ rules,” he said.\nHowever, it’s also in our roadmap to include rules of few progressive airlines, like JetBlue , because their rules work in favor of passengers. In other words, these airlines will compensate you even if they don’t have to, because it’s a part of their customer service strategy.”\nTravelers can start using ClaimAir via its website. “You arrive to your final destination and you find yourself staring at an empty baggage carousel. Shortly you realize that your baggage is missing and you don’t know what to do,” said Ladra. “Pick the “Baggage Delay or Loss” category, input your flight details and answer several easy question so the app can tell you what to do, including find a Baggage Claim desk directly at the airport, file your claim through a property irregularity report, request an overnight kit and an allowance for reasonable expenses or wait for possible delayed baggage delivery. It will also tell you that you are entitled to possibly obtain financial compensation amounting to $3,400.”\nTravelers can ask ClaimAir for help with their claims, said Ladra. “So we’ll keep an eye on it on your behalf and if you want us to submit a complaint to the airline either for a flat fee of $25 or a success fee of 25 percent [of the total compensation], we’d be more than happy to assist you,” he said.\nTravelers have two options if the ClaimAir app determines that an airline owes them compensation, said Ladra. “If you want to handle all communication with the airline on your own, we’ll create a letter of complaint that perfectly fits your situation for $25 flat fee,” he said. “But if you want us to act on your behalf when pursuing your claims and take care of all communication with the airline, we’ll do it for 25 percent success fee. It means that there is almost no effort needed from your side and we get paid only if we win.”\nIt usually takes up to eight weeks for a claim to be finalized, depending on airlines’ responsiveness, said Ladra. “Sometimes it’s easy case and sometimes not – airlines often behave tricky so you must be patient,” he said.\nPassengers simply don’t know their rights and airlines often take the advantage of it, said Ladra. “Related regulations, laws and conventions are so complicated that it’s close to impossible to squeeze all important information into a single piece of paper,” he said. “Moreover, we live in a fast-paced environment where people don’t have time to study tons of materials to understand their case. They want to click onto a web browser or tap into an app.”\nThe next step for ClaimAir is to create iOS and Android apps, said Ladra. “Mobile apps will allow us to notify our users in real-time about things like flight disruptions and possible entitlements.”\nBut the long-term goal is to make sure travelers are informed, said Ladra. “We don’t want our users to create thousands of complaints. We want them to use our app to be perfectly informed and ready for negotiations with airlines directly at the airport at the time of inconvenience so they can avoid creating complaints at all,” he said.\nShare ", "external_links": ["http://airconsumer.ost.dot.gov/publications/flyrights.htm", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/f/L/baggage1.jpg", "http://www.airfarewatchdog.com/pages/3802676/airline-contracts-of-carriage/", "http://www.jetblue.com/p/Bill_Of_Rights.pdf", "http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/passenger-rights/air/index_en.htm", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/W/f/L/baggage1.jpg", "http://www.iata.org/policy/Documents/passenger-rights.pdf", "http://www.icao.int/Meetings/atconf6/Documents/WorkingPapers/ATConf6-wp005_en.pdf"], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T19:38:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
