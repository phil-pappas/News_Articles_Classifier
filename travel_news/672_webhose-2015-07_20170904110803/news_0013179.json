Meanwhile local drops include Bakery Hill’s Double Wood whisky from Melbourne and New Zealand’s South Island Single Malt.\nPrincess’ bartenders are on hand to provide advice, while the menu provides notes on the bartenders’ favourites. Whiskies are available by the nip, with Princess also creating a daily flight of three whiskies for those keen to experience the flavour of different regions.\nSydney-based whisky expert Peter Stevens said it was exciting to see a cruise line create a dedicated whisky bar.\n“Whisky is growing in popularity across a range of age groups and the diverse variety in Princess’ new bar means there’s something there for both new and experienced whisky drinkers,” Mr Stevens said.\nFor first-time whisky drinkers, Mr Stevens has three key tips:\n· If you want to dilute your whisky, add a touch of water rather than ice as ice reduces the flavour\n· Roll the whisky around the glass and take time to smell it before you taste it – 75 per cent of the taste comes from the aromatics\n· To really enjoy your whisky, cleanse the palate with some cheese or fresh pear or figs between glasses.\nDawn Princess offers a range of itineraries from Australia year round. Fares on a 13-night round trip to New Caledonia and Vanuatu sailing from Sydney on January 16, 2016, start from $1399* per person twin share.\nRelated Posts Amawaterways Introduces More Opportunities dor Solo Travelers Helsingborg Launches Destiantion Video Princess Cruises Debuts Top Deck Wine Festival and Whisky Menu Cruising from Western Australia is set to surge over the next two years Princess Cruises to Double its Western Australian Presence", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T21:43:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
