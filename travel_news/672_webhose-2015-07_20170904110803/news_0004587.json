Then we have a lot of medical tourism. But we also have a lot of cultural and nature tourism.\"\nSoltanifar acknowledges that the tourism sector in Iran still has a long way to go. He blames international sanctions for some, but not all of the woes.\n\"In 10 years time we want to have 20 million tourists here in Iran and are expecting a revenue of about 30 billion dollars.\nJUST WATCHED Exploring Iran's ancient history Replay More Videos ...
