No one wants to sit inside and miss the parade of colourful craft, ancient villages and endless vineyards as we float through France in glorious spring sunshine.\n“Isn’t this a charming way to see France,” Bill Pennell, a retired lawyer from New York, says. “I’m sipping my viognier and looking at the snow-capped Pyrenees in the distance – how good’s that?”\nBill is one of the growing number of travellers who’ve caught the barging bug, because that’s what Enchanté is – an old 30m Belgian grain barge that’s had a $1 million revamp, now offering luxury cruises on the famed 330-year-old waterway built in the reign of King Louis XIV.\nRick Stein’s popular ABC-TV series French Food Odyssey was shot on the Midi.\n“It’s the oldest working canal in the world, a green ribbon of water with history, nature and good food and wine all bundled up into one amazing package,” French owner Louisa Gronow tells me as we glide past towering plane trees lining the banks.\n“They make for a beautiful tree-lined avenue, their foliage forming a canopy of olive-green shade.\n“In fact, Napoleon rested his troops under them from the hot summer sun.”\nBuilt at a cost of 15 million livres (the currency of France at the time), it was the equivalent of buying 300,000 cows. UNESCO describes it as “a work of art”. Enchante floats down the Canal du Midi, France.

There are only six of us on the voyage and we are met at the station by Louisa and taken to Enchanté , moored nearby, for a champagne welcome.\nMy travelling companions, all Americans, say they avoid mega-liners with thousands of passengers and chose Enchanté because it carries only eight passengers with the promise of a relaxing holiday at a slow, easy pace through France’s scenic rural landscape.\nWe’ll travel about 75km and cruise at just 3km/h. Talk about life in the slow lane.\nAlong the way we are waited on and pampered by two lovely hostesses, Daphne and Cheryl, and indulge in classic French cuisine on this fully crewed, all-inclusive cruise with a tour guide, daily excursions and an open bar. There’s an espresso machine in the lounge, free wi-fi, and unlimited wine.\nThe four twin cabins are spacious and have deep, plush-pile carpet, a big comfy bed and an ensuite with luxurious soaps and shampoos from Marseilles.\nThe cabins are painted white and that reflects the water through the portholes, creating dancing shadows on the walls and ceiling.\n“We wanted the interior to be light and bright and there’s a large seating area inside with big windows so you can still see the scenery if the weather’s bad,” Louisa says. There’s a bubbling jacuzzi on board. Picture: suppplied Source: Supplied\nOn deck, there’s a bubbling Jacuzzi and bikes to pedal into the villages and between the 25 locks we need to tackle on the Midi, like the incredible eight locks of Fonserannes.\nThe 312m-long water staircase lifts Enchanté to a height of 21.5m. It’s a squeeze as the barge rises up and down through all the levels. And there are some low bridges to pass under.\nBeing France, the focus is on food and wine, which is all sourced locally in the surrounding Languedoc region, France’s red-wine heartland.\nWe’ll pop the cork on 28 different wines, from cool rosés to glorious lemon-scented whites and hearty reds from Bordeaux and Burgundy. At dinner, we’re all eager to find out which wines are on the menu.\nOur hostess Daphne delights us one night with a 2012 crisp, smooth white sancerre from the Loire Valley and Quote: s Henry IV who said “if everybody drank sancerre, there’d be no more religious wars”.\nOur French chef Silvain orchestrates the meals from an open kitchen, so you can see him in action, his cuisine nicely balanced between beef, veal, fresh Norwegian salmon, salads and delectable desserts, and he doesn’t mind sharing his recipes.\nFor breakfast, our guide Anthony ducks into the nearest village to get freshly baked croissants, pastries and bread before we head out to explore the region.\nWe go to the indoor covered markets of Les Halles in Narbonne and wend our way through 70 colourful food stalls with their heady scent of spices, tasting the incredible array of cheeses, wine, pastries, pizzas and olives from the friendly sellers. Seeing the walled city of Carcassonne is a tour highlight. Picture: Getty Source: Supplied\nNearby is the eighth-century capital of Minerve and its 12th-century medieval Cathar fort. We wander its narrow lanes, hear tales of fearless knights and mysterious castles, and then stroll through a Benedictine Abbey where the nuns and priests back then apparently got up to all sorts of hanky-panky chasing each other around the cloisters.\nBut nothing matches the fairytale walled city of Carcassonne. Built by the Romans 2500 years ago, it’s the most complete fortified citadel in existence today with 56 watchtowers and drawbridges.\nIt’s like a movie set and in fact, it was the setting for the 1991 Kevin Costner film, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves , and the inspiration for Walt Disney’s Sleeping Beauty .\nAs the second-most visited place in France after the Eiffel Tower, its winding cobblestone streets are lined with charming boutiques and souvenir shops selling swords, bows and arrows, helmets and other weapons from days of old.\nEnchanté treats us to lunch in a pretty village and it’s a knockout four-course gourmet affair in an 1884 chateau, one of the many in Languedoc that boasts more Michelin-star restaurants than anywhere in the world.\nThen, a wine tasting at a vineyard where I buy a bottle of premium red for the ridiculous price of only €8 ($A12).\nThis is a cruise where you can take your watch off and step away from it all, dine in style, see France without the crowds and, dare I say, be enchanted.\nGO2\nENCHANTE\nGETTING THERE\nPrices for a 7-day/6-night cruise on Enchante are from Euro 4,390 (AU$6,210 at today’s rate) per person in a twin-share double cabin with all meals, wines, an open bar, excursions and local transfers.\nDepartures are weekly, every Sunday from March to October.\nTo book contact Outdoor Travel on 1800 331 582, or info@outdoortravel.com.au", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/22/1227452/649399-1e62400c-2aa4-11e5-acb7-33c75d95366a.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/22/1227452/649470-029bbce6-2a8f-11e5-acb7-33c75d95366a.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/22/1227452/650629-0928ce40-2a95-11e5-acb7-33c75d95366a.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-26T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T11:00:22.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
