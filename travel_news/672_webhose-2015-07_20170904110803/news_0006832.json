The Secret Service generally doesn't like me climbing mountains, but as a private citizen hopefully I can get away with something like that.” \nThe 5,895-metre peak, just over the border in Tanzania, is Africa's highest mountain. \nHe said he loved the Masai Mara and Serengeti national parks in Kenya and Tanzania, and had fond memories of a trip to Lamu island, on Kenya's Indian Ocean coast, that he made with his wife Michelle when they were engaged. \n“Lamu is high on my list. Michelle and I went there when we were engaged, I remember taking those dhows out, fishing, and the captain of the boat cooking the fish right on the beach. It was remarkable,” he told CapitalFM. — AFP-Relaxnews More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T05:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T11:08:29.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
