Who can forget the Nineties telly extravaganza of puzzlement, Fort Boyard ? Eager treasure hunters completed challenges to get through different levels of the fortress, and everyone at home dismissively thought, “I could do that.” Well, now you can. The Solent Fort Boyard Ultimate Challenge is held at Spitbank Fort on the Isle of Wight. Teams must compete to overcome physical and mental challenges, and reach the inner fortress to crack the “ancient coded symbols” and uncover the lost treasure chest. Challenges require skills, deductive powers and an average level of fitness. Spitbank Fort really is an island fortress, dropped into the sea, and reachable only by boat If you've always secretly fancied yourself holding the Goblet of Fire aloft as you read Harry Potter to the kids, this could be the answer. Unlock the Boxes of Fear, overcome the Buzzwire and the Pyramid, and avoid losing – the teams who fail to capture the fort get locked in the dungeon. Spitbank Fort really is an island fortress, dropped into the sea, and reachable only by boat – motorised dinghies will deliver you there before the challenge begins. Even if you feel group bonding events are a bit David Brent and rail against the idea of spending a weekend cooped up with colleagues wrestling over riddles, your resistance will be worn down by the sheer fun of it. Bouncing across the sea in RIBs, deciding who's best at climbing, who's the cunning problem-solver and who can keep a steady hand without touching an electrified wire will take you straight back to the fun of hanging out in a childhood gang. But afterwards, you get a hot tub and an excellent dinner to help you recover. It’s ideal if you're bored of corporate challenges that involve building Lego towers or sitting in a conference room discussing your personal weaknesses. This is more as though TV has come to life and beckoned you in. There's luxury accommodation in nine suites, a games room and spa facilities in the hotel, with room for groups of between 15 and 60 people. Plus the satisfaction of knowing you could have won the TV show. Even if Melinda Messenger isn't there this time.
