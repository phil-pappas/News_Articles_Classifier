The upgrade that beats first class! Delta Air Lines... World's longest helter skelter to be built in London's giant... No time to admire the view! Extreme parachute skiers... Today, Mrs Foote who has instructed a firm of personal injury lawyers to sue the tour operator which arranged the holiday said: 'Essentially I've had food poisoning for three years - it's unbelievable. I am still not eating because I am frightened. I am so paranoid I boil our water from the tap and put it in the fridge.\n'Lots of people go on holiday and get ill but to be ill three years later is ridiculous. I thought this would have been a great holiday for Tia but we couldn't take her anywhere because we were bed ridden. We just all came back looking like zombies.\n'I have been on many trips abroad and never had any problems. When you go abroad the whole point is to try the food but now I think I will never go abroad again. It was an absolute nightmare holiday from hell which I will never forget - just thinking about it makes me cry and I never thought I would be on anti-depressants because of a holiday.'\nThe Hauza Beach Resort, Nabq Bay in Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt where Lillian Foote was struck down with food poisoning\nLillian and granddaughter Tia swimming before becoming ill on their Egyptian holiday from hell\nLillian and her partner Geoff Humphries, 65, had spent Â£2,500 to take their seven year old granddaughter Tia to the Hauza Beach Resort in popular holiday destination, Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, for 10 days to help celebrate his remission from cancer.\nOn arrival they had breakfast, lunch and dinner at the hotel but three days into the trip the couple both complained of stomach cramps and soon became violently ill.\nLillian Foote stands with her partner Geoff at their home in Warrington\n'At first I thought it was just Geoff and I adjusting to the travelling but Tia had only been eating boiled eggs and wasn't ill. Then we noticed up to 15 other holidaymakers sitting around the pool became unwell too and we had to fight to get the bathroom. It was a nightmare scenario.\n'We had been really diligent about tap water - I don't even brush my teeth in it and we didn't touch it. But I think the kitchen staff washed their food in it.\n'There was no bottled water in the room and all the cleaner could bring to our room was a one litre bottle of coke with the seal already broken. Staff wouldn't let me fill up my own water bottle at a plastic font - despite me needing to take my diabetes medication.\n'There was uncooked meat lying out for long periods of time, flies surrounding the food. The hotel had a medical centre but it sent off for medication from Cairo that wasn't marked and had no instruction - and it turned out to be an antibiotic I was allergic to.\n'Eventually we had to get to a taxi to the nearest chemist for tablets. At one stage we were living on crisps and we were unable to leave our hotel room for virtually the whole holiday. We didn't want to risk getting an earlier flight home for fear of being ill on the plane.'\nBack home Mrs Foote took Kaolin and morphine which seemed to settle her stomach but as soon as she stopped taking it the symptoms returned. She has been scheduled for surgery as doctors found lumps and parasites in her intestines which they say are twisted.\nShe said: 'I thought the medication would clear my system but I couldn't take it anymore. I was that down that I was crying and crying and I was put on anti-depressants and I am still on them now. As soon as I feel that stomach pain I know what it is. It's crippling. I am still not eating because I am frightened to eat.\n'I look at lettuce and think I need to wash it in boiled water. I know for a fact it will be safe in our tap water but I can't help it.\nThe holiday was supposed to be a time for fun and relaxation, but for Mrs Foote, it turned out very different\nThis photo shows Mrs Foote two months after returning from the Egypt holiday where she fell ill\n'I am so unhappy this has ended up like this. It just does not seem to want to resolve itself. People talk about getting ill on holiday but having this for three years now is ridiculous. I just want to get it sorted out and want to help other in the same situation and prevent it happening again to someone else.\n'Ever since we got back from our holiday I have continued to suffer from bowel problems which I may be stuck with permanently.'\nSpecialist travel lawyers at Irwin Mitchell, who are representing the couple, are also aware of other holidaymakers who have fallen ill at the resort in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014 while travel rating website Trip Advisor has received very mixed reviews for the hotel with one person claiming guests were 'getting taxis to Burger King'.\nIrwin Mitchell has called on tour operator The Freedom Travel Group to work with them to resolve Lillian and Geoff's cases amicably without the need for formal court proceedings.\nTo date, no formal denial of liability has been received in respect of the claims and negotiations on behalf of Lillian and Geoff continue.\nMrs Foote has instructed lawyers to look into how and why she fell ill while on holiday in Sharm El-Sheikh\nClare Pearson, a specialist international personal injury lawyer, said: 'Lillian and Geoff were looking forward to taking their granddaughter Tia away for 10 days in Egypt.\n'Unfortunately, as both Lillian and Geoff fell ill during their stay and throughout their holiday, the break was ruined.\n'Over the years we have handled thousands of holiday illness cases and have seen just how devastating gastric problems can be for those affected.\n'We have also represented dozens of clients who have also stayed at the Hauza Beach resort and fallen ill during their stay.'\nA spokesperson for The Freedom Travel Group said: 'The Freedom Travel Group takes health and hygiene issues very seriously. We know how important holidays are to customers who book with us, and how upsetting it can be if they become unwell while overseas.\n'We work closely with our partners to ensure the holidays we offer operate to the highest health and hygiene standards, so were sorry to hear about the Foote family's experience in Egypt in September 2012. We can confirm that we have recently been contacted by a solicitor acting on behalf of the party.\n'Accordingly, as we are now in the process of liaising directly with their legal representatives we are unable to comment further at this time so as not to unduly influence any possible legal proceedings.'\nMailOnline Travel has contacted the Hauza Beach Resort and is awaiting comment.", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1eCmSAD"], "published": "2015-07-30T16:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T12:05:25.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
