It also surpasses the global industry forecast issued by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) in January this year for international tourist arrivals to increase by 3 to 4 percent. Indeed, we are even above our own internal target for the year.\" Jemmott said. \nThe BTMI chairman also noted that visitor spend was up by 5 percent though there was a reduction in the average length of stay. He cited a number of macro-economic factors including the UK APD adjustments, which took effect during the last quarter; falling unemployment in the US; and lower oil prices reducing the cost of business and improved travel schedules within the Caribbean region. An economic slow down in Europe, lower oil receipts in Trinidad and economic challenges in Latin America, he observed, represented the major downsides. \nThe local cruise tourism continued to hold its own during the period Apr. - June of 2015 with preliminary figures showing there were 52 cruise ship calls and 115, 231 cruise passenger arrivals – an increase of six percent in calls and 12 percent in passenger arrivals for the same period in 2014. \nThe chairman also revealed that Barbados’ accommodation sector is projected to receive new and refurbished plant or 2,300 additional rooms between 2015 and 2019 to the tune of $2 billion. \nCEO at the BTMI, William Griffith, said, even with the current positive momentum, they had been working with their partners to ensure Barbados performed similarly during the softer months ahead, particularly September and October. \nThrough the Brilliant Barbados campaign, which was valid for travel during the period May 9 - Dec. 19, over 1,000 booking were received after the first month of sale. This is equivalent to 5,500 room nights by over 2,000 visitors. The BTMI also proactively held meetings with eight of its airline partners to explore additional cooperative marketing efforts for the upcoming winter season, as well as opportunities to grow the number of available gateways. \nThe CEO also cited a number of important strategic projects currently underway including plans to creatively articulate the island's brand positioning and an RFP for the creation of a new destination website. He stated that the organization has tightened expenditure controls across the board, which was challenging the BTMI global team to become more creative and more targeted in the execution of its marketing initiatives.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T20:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T20:49:52.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
