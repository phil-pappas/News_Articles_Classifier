Whether a giant expedition model for weeklong mountain ascents or just a basic day pack, everyone has a favorite type for their favorite travels. But one problem with a backpack — it’s on your back. You can’t see or reach your stuff without taking the pack off and unzipping it. Meanwhile, potential thieves have access to the pack while you’re looking forward. To solve this issue, try the Mindshift Rotation180 Travel Away backpack. It’s a sturdy, well-designed day pack with organized interior pockets along with a twist: The pack comes with an integrated belt pack with pouches that can either ride in front on your waist or be spun around to hide in back inside the body of the pack. Depending on the model, the belt pouches can hold small valuables like passport, wallet and phone, or supersize pouches can tote your SLR camera for quick-shooting access.\nWhy we like it: The rotating belt pouch allows quick access and protection for valuables and often-used items like sunscreen, snack bars and camera. The overall pack has a very sturdy construction.\nNot so much: The spinning belt feature may not be essential for everyone, and it could be prone to damage if you keep rotating it all day long.\nVitals: Mindshift’s Rotation180 Travel Away 22L, $200, www.mindshiftgear.com.\n— Bill Fink , travel@sfchronicle.com", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/36/43/8251636/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/36/43/8251636/7/920x920.jpg", "http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-07-09T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T13:21:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
