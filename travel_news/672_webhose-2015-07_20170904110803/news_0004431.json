Luckily my colleague shot it,” he told local radio NRK shortly after the incident in March. \nZuzanna Hakova, who was part of the same tour group, said her mother then shot the bear three times with a revolver and it fled. \n“We woke to shouts of \"Bear! Bear!\" coming from the second tent,\" she told NRK. \n\"We had a rifle on the outside of each tent and we also had a revolver in our tent. The ones being attacked had no chance of getting their weapon, so my mother took her revolver and shot the bear three times.\" \nThe bear survived the gunshots and was later put down by local hunters. \nThe tourists were relieved to escape with only minor injuries - but Svalbard’s local authorities took a dim view of the incident. \nThey have fined the leader of their party 10,000 kroner as local environment laws insist travelers “take precautions” against the possibility of a bear attack. \n“They had not put in place the necessary safeguards. There was only one tripwire that was set too high and the bear went under it. Nor did they have a polar bear watch at the time,” Svalbard's Assistant Governor Jens Olav Sæter told local newspaper Svalbardposten. \nThe deaths of many polar bears could be avoided if people took greater safety precautions, he added. \nIt is understood to be the first case of someone beoing fined for a polar bear attack in Norway. \nThe 10,000 kroner fine is the culmination of a four month investigation into whether the group were guilty of any wrongdoing. \nThe attack happened as thousands of tourists descended on Svalbard and the Faeroe Islands ahead of a rare total solar eclipse last March. \nThe group leader, whose identity is unknown, has been informed of the ruling but it is unclear whether it will be enforced, according to Svalbardposten.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T09:23:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
