Swim times and distances can be logged on the National Open Water Swimming Coaching Association safety bands that all competitive swimmers are required to wear. \nCourses run by trained professionals will be offered for those wishing to hone their open water swimming skills. \n• The UK's best outdoor pools and lidos \nThe water is tested every two weeks to ensure it meets standards required for swimming, and although children between the ages of 6-16 are allowed into the water, they must swim with a parent or guardian, must be able to swim 200m without stopping, and must wear a wetsuit and a tow float. They will also only be able to swim within a set course. \nThe swimming area, opened in a collaboration between London Royal Docks Open Water Swimming and the Royal Docks Management Authority, is the latest in a series of urban open water swimming areas that have grown in popularity in the recent past. \n• London's best outdoor pools and lidos \nIn May, a swimming pond opened in the King’s Cross area in London , while the 100-metre long Jesus Green lido in Cambridge attracts both tourists and city residents. In Europe, Copenhagen Harbour Baths provide a place to cool off in the Danish capital. In Germany, Berlin is better known for history and art, but urban lakes including Müggelsee and Plötzensee attract swimmers too . \nA swimming pond opened near King's Cross station in May \n• The best urban swimming spots in European cities \nLondon’s Royal Docks were once the largest enclosed docks in the world, although their closure led to high levels of deprivation in the surrounding area. They are currently undergoing a regeneration programme to transform them into a business and residential area, with an aim to become a new entertainment destination in the capital. \nSwimming at the Royal Docks costs £8 per session, which take place Wednesday 4-8pm, Thursday 6-9.30am, Friday 4-8pm and Sunday 7-10am. The closest station is Royal Victoria Dock on the DLR. Alternatively take the Emirates Airline Cable Car from North Greenwich.
