Michael Taylor's basic, no-nonsense Nokia offers access to Facebook, which offers an important lifeline to the outside world. Photo Credit: Accidental Travel Writer. \n\nAn inexpensive Nokia comes to the rescue thanks to its ability to penetrate the Great Firewall of China. \nAfter being refused exit by customs at the Luohu border crossing in Shenzhen, China, I head back to the police station. On my way, I stop at Luohu Commercial City and get a charger for my mobile phone. \nRe-assured that my power won't run out, I post the following plea on Facebook: \n\"I am in Shenzhen, my passport has been stolen, and customs won't let me cross the border into Hong Kong. Will someone please contact the U.S. Consulate, inform them of my situation, and seek their advice?\" \nThe fact I can do this negates that old saying, \"You get what you pay for.\" \nIn case you didn't know, Facebook is banned in China. There are ways around this - usually special software or some kind of app, but I've got neither. \nFor reasons that I don't understand, my no nonsense Nokia - about as cheap a model as you can get - overrides the Great Firewall of China and gives me a lifeline to the outside world. \nChina Travel Service Shenzhen Train Station. Photo Credit: Accidental Travel Writer. \nMy second stop is the China Travel Service, which the police had suggested I stop at in case I run into any difficulties at customs. \nUnfortunately, they didn't give me an exact address. They didn't even tell me what building it was in - just that it was \"next to customs\". \nI finally figure out that it is in the Shenzhen Train Station, but even that doesn't help much. I still have considerable difficulty finding the place, making several trips up and down stairways and along long corridors only to discover that I'm right back where I started. \nAfter several false starts, I locate it. I am given a small piece of paper with the address of an office that I should go to to report my missing passport. Unfortunately, it is closed today because it's Saturday. I don't know yet that it will also be closed on Monday because it is a national holiday. \nBut this raises an important question: why wasn't I given this address at customs in the first place and why wasn't I given it by the police? \nBy the time I get back to the police station, I am fit to be tied. While discussing my predicament with the duty officer, I discover that someone has answered my plea on Facebook. \nUnited States Consulate General United States Consulate in Hong Kong.

Both say that there is nothing I can do until Tuesday because Monday is a public holiday. \nShe gives me an emergency number to call. I ask to borrow the phone. I dial the number and am spliced through to the US Consulate General in Guangzhou. \nThe man answering the phone is expecting my call. One of the first things he says is, \"We cannot provide financial aid.\" \n\"That won't be necessary,\" I say. \"Fortunately my credit card wasn't stolen.\" \nI am told that there is nothing I can do until Tuesday, but that a temporary replacement passport can usually be issued the same day. \nThe visa application, however, usually takes 3 days to a week. \nIt's only day 2, and my unexpected Chinese \"adventure\" appears to be just starting. \nTo Be Continued \nMake It Happen! \nShenzhen is a modern city with all manner of accommodation, from luxurious 5 star resorts to modest dormitories to a capsule hotel with capsules renting for just over US$10 a night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T07:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T09:37:48.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
