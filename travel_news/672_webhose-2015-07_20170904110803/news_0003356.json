Airlines are courting big-spending business travelers because they typically spend a lot more on airfares and they’re earning more miles or points. Meanwhile, leisure travelers are earning a fraction of what they once earned on some airlines.\nSales to Hong Kong We’ve seen big price drops to Hong Kong several times in the past 60 days, with round-trip fares in the $700 range from Dallas. Sale fares were offered by multiple carriers, including American, Delta and United. If you’re not an elite frequent flier, the number of miles you can earn on this kind of sale fare is sad. It’s about 16,000 miles round trip from Dallas to Hong Kong, and even more if connecting, but you’ll only earn a fraction of that when flying on sale fares with revenue-based programs.\nIf you’re not an elite frequent flier and you buy on Delta or United, you’d earn five points per dollar on the base fare and carrier-imposed surcharges, but you don’t earn miles on government-imposed taxes and fees. The maximum number of miles you would earn would be 3,100 because about $80 of the fare is government taxes and fees. American and US Airways still calculate based on miles flown, so you would earn 16,000 miles, which is almost halfway to a free domestic ticket.\nIf you paid $1,300 to go from Dallas to Paris, you would have to subtract about $150 in taxes from the revenue-based programs. On United and Delta, you would earn five times the base fare and fuel surcharge, so it would be about 5,750 miles; on American, you would earn the miles flown, 9,860.\nIf you are a superelite frequent flier, you can earn 11 times the dollars spent on your airfare with Delta and United. If you purchase a business-class ticket and pay $5,000 after taxes for an international flight, you could end up with 55,000 miles for just one trip. Plus, if you charge your ticket to your affinity credit card, you could earn double miles on the purchase price of the ticket, giving you a grand total of 65,000 air miles. Most people won’t pay that much for a ticket, because getting the cheapest fare available is usually a buyer’s priority.\nThe frequent-flier earning works the same for domestic travel, where we also see revenue-based programs from Southwest, Virgin America and JetBlue. We recently saw round-trip fares on sale from Dallas to Los Angeles for $137 on American, United and Virgin America. You could earn 2,500 miles on American, but only about 500 on United and Virgin America.\nOn Southwest On this same route, Southwest was charging $138 for its cheapest fare and $1,022 for a business-select fare. Southwest offers its superelite travelers 24 points per mile, so these travelers could earn close to 24,000 points for a business fare. If you’re a leisure traveler without status, you would earn approximately 600 points for the cheapest sale fare.\nI have never heard as much uproar as when Southwest converted from flight segments to a revenue-based system. Many travelers were taking advantage of the old system.\nI remember airfares from Dallas to Houston for $78-$98 round trip, and air travelers could earn more segment points by making a connection through Austin or San Antonio to get four segment points for one trip. With 16 segment points they earned a free ticket systemwide, with very few restrictions. Back then, you could fly just four round trips, with connections, to earn a free round-trip ticket. The business traveler was paying four or five times the money, but earning the same number of segments.\nSouthwest decided it was time to take care of the high-paying travelers and now it has a very rewarding program for the superelite business traveler, especially when buying business select fares.\nYou’ll need to be careful when flying on codeshare tickets. You may want to put all your codeshare miles on American when you can, because of the current higher earnings. Also be aware that British Airways charges the fuel surcharge, which can be as much as $516 on award tickets to Europe. If you are redeeming miles, you are better off flying on American because you don’t have to pay that hefty fuel-surcharge fee.\nThe airlines are competing for high-paying business travelers, and they admit it. The more you pay, the more they’ll take care of you with perks such as more frequent-flier points and free upgrades. And in the end, you’ll earn free trips faster.\nAffinity cards While many airlines have converted to revenue-based programs, there is an area where you can earn bonus frequent-flier miles. If you have an affinity credit card, you can earn miles or points based on dollars spent. You can use your affinity card to make purchases anywhere and earn miles or points.\nMy advice to leisure travelers who don’t have elite status is to go with the airline with the cheapest ticket price instead of focusing on earning frequent-flier miles. If American is among the airlines with the cheapest tickets or comparable airfares, you’ll likely earn more than you would with a competing airline. We’re not sure how long American will offer miles based on travel, but enjoy it while it lasts.\nTom Parsons is the editor of bestfares.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T21:22:48.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
