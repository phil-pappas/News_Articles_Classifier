As always, we will continue to provide that care, and serve the 2.7 million women, men and young people who rely on us each year.”\nThe hackers call themselves “social justice warriors” who are “seeking to reclaim some sort of lulz [sic] for the years and thousands of dollars that Planned Parenthood have wasted and made harvesting your babies,” according to their website, which news.com.au has chosen not to name or link to.\nIn the previously released videos , recorded in 2014 and 2015 by people posing as buyers of foetal tissue footage shows Planned Parenthood officials discussing the amount the group charges to provide the organs and the abortion procedures used to obtain the organs.\nIn Australia, abortion is still illegal in NSW and Queensland, except for when a doctor believes a woman’s physical and/or mental health is in serious danger. In NSW social, economic and medical factors may also be taken into account. Abortion is legal in all other states and territories in Australia, with varying policies.\nOriginally published as Details of abortion workers hacked", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/planned-parenthood-hacked-and-employee-emails-released/story-fnu2q5nu-1227460827105", "http://www.dailydot.com/politics/planned-parenthood-hacked-anti-abortion-3301/", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/shocking-video-shows-planned-parenthood-director-discussing-sale-of-baby-body-parts/story-fnu2q5nu-1227443329167"], "published": "2015-07-29T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T20:28:53.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
