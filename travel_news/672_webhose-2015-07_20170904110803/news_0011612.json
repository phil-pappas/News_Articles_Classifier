It matters not which of them inflicted any particular injury,” Chief Justice Kourakis said.\nMotorcycles inside the Finks clubrooms at Salisbury. Source: News Corp Australia\nChief Justice Kourakis found that Ciantar, 25 and Niemann, 26, were Finks nominees at the time and had acted as a lookout as the assault unfolded. Mr Bonnici, who was sergeant-at-arms of the Finks’ north chapter at the time, was left in a critical condition after the bashing, and suffered injuries including a collapsed lung, 13 fractured ribs, lacerations to his face, a broken jaw and nasal bone and permanent brain damage.\n“Mr Bonnici is likely to permanently suffer mood and behaviour dysfunction. He will be left with a predisposition to physical aggression and reactiveness due to irritability and impulsivity,” Chief Justice Kourakis said.\nThe Chief Justice said while Mr Bonnici’s status as a senior bikie did not mitigate the offending, it did not deserve a penalty as severe as the bashing of a random person would.\n“All things being equal, the assault on Mr Bonnici will not attract a sentence as high as those which might be imposed for violent offences committed by outlaw motorcycle gangs on innocent members of the public who have no association at all with their attackers,” he said.\nFormer boxer Mostyn Niemann has been jailed for his part in the bashing of a fellow Finks bikie. Source: News Limited\nIn declaring Dettman a serious repeat offender, Chief Justice Kourakis said the senior bikie had a criminal history dating back to when he was 15 and had spent 16 of the past 20 years in custody. Dettman’s first violent offence as an adult was the assault with a broken bottle of an off-duty police officer in August 1990, for which he was jailed for 30 months.\nChief Justice Kourakis said Dettman had failed to change his ways despite numerous chances and said he believed he was “not yet capable of extracting himself from his lawless ways”.\nHe accepted that Dettman was “reasonably intelligent and competent” but said “however clever Mr Dettman may be, it is his moral compass that is the issue”.\n“As sergeant-at-arms he took a leadership role in the Finks by re-establishing the south chapter,” Chief Justice Kourakis said.\n“He has attracted young men like Mr Cekic and Mr Ciantar to his side.\n“He remains a relatively fit and strong man. I found in my reasons for verdict, that despite his denials, he was a member of the Terror Team.”\nThe Finks clubrooms at Salisbury.

Mr Dettman will be 53 years of age,” he said.\n“At that age and after being separated from his criminal associates for such a long period I expect that the risk of serious repeat offending will have substantially reduced.”\nPaunovic was jailed for 12 years with a non-parole period of eight-and-a-half years, and Cekic was also jailed for 12 years, with a shorter non-parole period of seven years and 10 months.\nCiantar, who has spent 16 hours a day inside his Adelaide Remand Centre cell since April 2013, received a head sentence of nine years and a non-parole period of six years and two months.\nThe Finks logo on the wall of the Salisbury clubrooms.
