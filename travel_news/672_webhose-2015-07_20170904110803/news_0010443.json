Crews worked on the water line into the night and it was almost completely repaired on Monday morning, he said. In the meantime, residents in the large apartment complex had to use bottled water and portable toilets.\nResidents are being issued a 48-hour boil water notice, May said. “It’s just out of abundance of caution. When water mains break contaminants can enter the system,” May said.\nMay said the water line dates back to the 1950s.\n Jennifer Sullivan: 206-464-8294 or jensullivan@seattletimes.com .
