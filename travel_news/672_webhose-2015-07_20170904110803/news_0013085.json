Follow each step carefully to prevent it from leaking. SERVES 8- 10 INGREDIENTS For the pastry 400g pastry flour 200g unsalted butter, cut into cubes Pinch of sea salt 175g icing sugar 150ml cream 2 egg yolks For the filling 300ml double cream 310g caster sugar 10 eggs Zest and juice of 5 lemons Icing sugar (optional) METHOD Place the flour and butter in a bowl and rub them together with your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Mix in a good pinch of salt and the icing sugar. Pour in the cream and, using one hand, work the dry ingredients into the wet. Try not to overwork the dough. Bring it together into a ball and turn out on to a well floured surface. Gently work it into a uniform roll, wrap in clingfilm and chill for at least an hour. Roll the pastry out to the thickness of a pound coin and use it to line a straight-sided, 5cm-deep 23cm tart ring (leave the edges untrimmed and overhanging the edge of the tin). Patch up any holes with excess pastry (hang on to it in case you need to make repairs later). Prick the base with a fork and put in the fridge for an hour. Place a baking tray in the oven and preheat to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Line the pastry with scrunched-up parchment paper and fill with baking beans or rice. Place on the tray and blind-bake for 15 minutes, or until the edges are starting to brown (if it needs longer, return to the oven and watch it closely). Remove the beans and paper. Repair any gaps with little pieces of raw pastry. Turn the oven down to 160C/gas mark 3. Return the tin to the oven and bake for as long as it takes to turn golden brown all over. Trim the pastry edges with a sharp knife. Beat the egg yolks together (add a teaspoon of water to loosen, if needed), and brush the case all over with the eggwash. Bake the pastry case for a minute, eggwash again, and bake for another minute to seal it fully. Reduce the oven temperature to 100C/210F/gas mark ¼. Mix together the cream, sugar and eggs, then stir in the lemon juice and zest. You can leave this mix overnight . Now my trick is to gently warm the filling in a microwave to around 50C (don’t leave it in too long, in case the eggs scramble – just heat in short bursts). This means the mixture doesn’t have to spend too long heating up in the delicate pastry case. Place the pastry case on a tray in the oven and gently pour the lemon mixture in, right to the top. Bake for 20 minutes then check it every five minutes, tapping the side of the tin with a spoon. It’s done when the filling just wobbles but is clearly cooked. Remove the tart ring. Put the tart on its base in the fridge for about 20 minutes. This sets the pastry but the filling will still be slightly warm when you slice into it. Sift over icing sugar before serving if you like.
