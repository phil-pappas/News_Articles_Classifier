They stuck with that theme when they launched a 5K to be run on Super Bowl Sunday and named it the Superb Owl Shuffle 5K.\nWhen they tried to register Superb Owl, the NFL informed Schafer that the league was considering a challenge to the application. Schafer continued to correspond with the league’s legal team to reach an amicable solution, but the NFL formally opposed the application in a recent filing with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.\nRELATED: Beat the dog days of summer with these workout options\nAccording to the filing, the NFL believes that Schafer and Lookabaugh’s event is attempting to “trade off of the substantial goodwill associated with the NFL’s Super Bowl” trademarks, and that the league is being damaged because use of “Superb Owl” will “cause confusion” in the marketplace or “deceive consumers.”\nThe Night Run company is an Arizona 501(c)(3) nonprofit that raises funds for local charities. Talk about substantial goodwill.\n“We thought it would be fun to use that name, but the NFL is very protective of their trademarks, so we researched it,” Schafer said this year.\nSchafer said the second Superb Owl Shuffle 5K is scheduled for Feb. 7, 2016, at Kiwanis Park in Tempe and includes a fitness expo, kid’s dash and tailgate party. Meanwhile, Schafer and Lookabaugh have set up a page to raise money for legal fees at gofundme.com/owlhelp.\n“We intend to respond and participate fully in the process,” Schafer said via e-mail.\nPatience, Grasshopper\nThe Moon Valley Grasshopper Bridge 5K has long been one of the best-run small races in the Valley, with a flat, fast course and cool award plaques designed by local artist Frank Ybarra.\nRELATED: Recreation abounds on Payson's Houston Mesa Road​\nThe race has grown from fewer than 300 runners in 2006 to as many as 750 in recent years.

His original goal was to run the 3,121 miles in 84 days. He later decided he would try to complete the journey in 80 days.\nHe made it in 79. He left Santa Monica Pier on April 25 and arrived in Central Park on July 12, needing only 10 miles on the final day to finish. He did those barefoot.\nKatsuyama slept and ate in an RV driven by his friend Greg Wilson from San Diego. Katsuyama’s wife Neung cooked the meals.\n“So, this is finished,” he wrote in a blog he kept during the journey. “But, I will keep on running.... I will keep on chasing dreams. And, I want to support my friends, who want to chase their dreams.”\nTry this next\nThe Machine Solutions Run and Walk for Kids takes place on Soldiers Trail, which loops through the forest around Fort Tuthill County Park in Flagstaff.
