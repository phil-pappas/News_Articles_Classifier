Q1 average fare fell 4% to just €45, due to the timing of Easter, weaker April yields and lower checked bag penetration as more families and business customers enjoy discounts on their luggage or benefit from our free second carry-on bag policy.” \nRyanair added that it was the success of its AGB strategy which had prompted its decision earlier this month to accept International Airlines Group’s offer for its 29.8% stage in Aer Lingus. \nIts original plan for Aer Lingus was to use it as a mid-prices brand to offer competition at primary airports, which this had been overtaken by the ABG programme under which Ryanair had now entered a number of primary airports in its own right. \n“As the Ryanair brand develops and continues to grow strongly, the original rationale for acquiring Aer Lingus no longer exists,” it added. “If the IAG offer is successful, then we would expect to receive these proceeds in mid/late September and the board will consider our use of the proceeds around the time of our AGM.” \nHowever, Ryanair said it would continue to oppose the UK Competition and Markets Authority’s “baseless” ruling in 2013 that Ryanair should have to sell its stake in Aer Lingus, and the CMA’s recent rejection of a request by Ryanair to review that decision. \nRyanair said the divestment decision “was based on the invented theory that no other airline would bid for Aer Lingus while Ryanair was a minority shareholder”. It added: “This has been hopelessly exposed by IAG’s current offer for Aer Lingus, even while Ryanair was its largest single shareholder.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T05:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T04:51:51.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
