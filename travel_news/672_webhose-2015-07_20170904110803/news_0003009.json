The rare mid-July rain was associated with moisture from both the Southwest monsoon and Dolores. \nThe spotty storms during the balance of this week could reach as far west as Los Angeles and San Diego and as far north as Las Vegas, Nevada, and Phoenix and Flagstaff, Arizona. \nThe greatest chance of a thunderstorm in Los Angeles and San Diego counties is on Thursday. \nThe bulk of the storms will occur during the late afternoon and evening hours, but there will be some exceptions. \nThe storms will tend to be rather slow-moving and can put down a great deal of rain in a short period of time. \nThe storms have the potential to bring 0.25 of 0.50 of an inch of rain in about an hour, which is enough to cause flash and urban flooding. A small number of the storms can last longer and be more potent. \nTucson, Arizona, was smacked with 1.36 inches of rain in two hours during Tuesday evening. The storm produced wind gusts to 64 mph. A successful swift water rescue of two adults took place in the Rodeo Wash area in Tucson. \nMotorists should use caution when traveling through or along normally dry stream beds. In addition to rapidly rising water, quick runoff can push debris onto some roadways. \nLightning strikes are also a concern. People outdoors should seek shelter indoors as soon as the first clap of thunder is heard. \nMany of the storms will produce little or no rainfall, so lightning could ignite new wildfires.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T22:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T22:30:47.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
