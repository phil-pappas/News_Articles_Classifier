She is keen to organise a publishing association conference in Beijing or Shanghai in spring 2017. \n\nThe American Society of Association Executives (ASAE) – with more than 21,000 individual members and nearly 10,000 industry partners from tax-exempt organisations – believes the draft legislation will make it extremely difficult for US trade associations and professional societies to be active in China. \n\nASAE president and CEO John Graham, in a letter to the Law Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, said the legislation would significantly impact US and China economic and commercial relations. \n\nHe added that major restrictions would be placed on the ability of its association professionals to meet, share knowledge, conduct business, and share best practices with Chinese associations, severly curtailing association programmes in China. \n\nGraham said ASAE was “particularly concerned” with the overly broad definition of NGO, that all foreign NGOs would have to have a government-affiliated sponsor approved by an Industry Supervisory Unit and that “the overall tone of the legislation treats all foreign NGOs as threats to the national security of China”. \n\nWhile the proposed law has the potential to streamline the process for associations active in China for a long time, the current draft would have major negative implications and ASAE has asked for an opportunity to discuss the issue further.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T09:36:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
