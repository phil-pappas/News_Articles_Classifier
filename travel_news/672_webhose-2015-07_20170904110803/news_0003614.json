Kraig Becker \nThe Adventure Travel 101 series is designed to provide helpful information for veteran and beginner travelers alike. These posts are intended to inspire readers to pursue their adventurous dreams, while providing them helpful tips and skills to make traveling easier and more enjoyable along the way. \nSo you've learned how to get started in adventure travel , and you've even picked a destination for your very first adventure. You've even booked your flight for your upcoming trip. Now, it is time to get ready to go, which means packing your bags and preparing to set out at long last. But packing for this kind of adventure can be a real challenge, particularly if you're new to this style of travel. Here are some tips to help get you started. \nTravel Light Generally speaking, adventure travelers can benefit more than anyone else from learning to travel light. The trips that they take tend to be more active, and often they'll be required to carry all of their gear with them as the move from one place to the next. Lugging a heavy suitcase around isn't generally ideal, even if it is on wheels. Instead, carry a duffle bag or backpack, and bring only the minimum amount of gear that you'll need for the trip. Adventure travel doesn't often afford much in the way of luxuries, so learn to travel lean, take only the things you absolutely need, and look for ways to carve ounces off the weight of your bags. You'll be surprised what you can do without, and it can be very liberating to discover just how light you can go. \nBut Not Too Light All of that said, there are a few items that you should always carry with you no matter the circumstances. For instance, be sure to bring a first aid kit stocked with bandaids, pain pills, and other medicines. You may not ever need to use it, but you'll have it with you just in case. Adventure Medical Kits makes some excellent options that have been designed specifically with the adventure traveler in mind. Other things to take include a water bottle and water treatment options, a travel towel , sunglasses and sun protection, and some snacks. \nPack Smart If you're only going to bring the things that you absolutely need, those items must to be able to perform at a very high level. That means you should look for versatility and reliability in your gear. Bring clothing that is lightweight and packable, with antimicrobial and odor resistant properties as well. Ex Officio or Rail Riders both make excellent lines of clothing that fit this description and look good too. This allows you to wear those items more than once throughout the trip, thus reducing the number of clothes that you need to bring with you overall. Also, pack clothing that is made from technical fabrics that breathe well and can wick moisture. Leave the cotton apparel at home, as it generally performs poorly in adverse conditions. \nPack for the Trip Be sure to pack for the trip you are taking, meaning bring clothes that are made for the environment you are visiting. Making a trip to Antarctica? Pack a warm winter jacket, gloves, and boots. Traveling to the Sahara Desert, bring lightweight clothing that is meant to help protect you from the sun and keep you cool in warm temperatures. For guidance in this area simply take a look at your itinerary a,d do some research on the weather at your destination during the time that you will be visiting. And if you've booked a trip with a guide service, as them for a packing list. Chances are they can provide you with some invaluable advice. \nTechnology Technology can be a valuable resource to take with us when we travel today, and that includes adventure travel. A smartphone is a great option to take with you just about anywhere, and SIM cards for voice and data plans are often inexpensive. Unless there is an incredibly compelling reason to bring your laptop, leave it at home. A notebook computer can add unnecessary extra weight, and they can be damaged easily on an active trip. A small tablet makes a good substitute however, as they can provide much of the same functionality, but in a smaller, lighter package. You can also protect your tablet with a special case like the ones made by Pelican . Just remember, keeping any gadget charged while on the go can be a challenge as well, although there are solutions for that too . \nWith a bit of common sense, forethought, and experience, you'll soon discover that packing for an adventure trip isn't as challenging as you once thought. After doing it a time or two, you'll soon learn what works and what doesn't. You'll also discover what pieces of gear are most important to you, and which don't perform up to the standards that you've set. That experience will serve as guidance for future expeditions as well, and make each trip that much easier to prepare for.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T00:39:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
