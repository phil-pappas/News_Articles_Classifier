His influence is great.” \nThat is exactly what Seiko wants - attracting the attention of Chinese buyers. The watches do not come cheap with some costing US$6,000, while the most expensive costs over US$250,000. \nChinese shoppers have been aggressively buying luxury items. According to the ministry responsible for tourism, Chinese visitors pay an average of ¥100,000 (US$800) for watches - more than any other nationality. \nIn the first six months of the year, the number of tourists from mainland China has doubled to more than two million. \nOne retailer at a popular mall says sales have improved 30 per cent compared to last year for everything from cosmetics to expensive booze. \n“Seventy per cent of our sales among foreign customer are Chinese,” said Nobuhiro Hattori, manager of the marketing and sales planning section at Matsuya. “They are our very important customers.” \nThe weaker yen is proving to be a boost for retailers in Japan, with Chinese tourists buying everything from shoes to diamond wedding rings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T21:42:21.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
