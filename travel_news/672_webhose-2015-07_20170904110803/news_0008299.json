But McGowan wasn’t on hand simply as an actress; she was also there presenting her beautifully dark directorial debut, Dawn . The short premiered at Sundance last year to a buzzy reception, and to a no-less-buzzy one last night when it was shown alongside The Doom Generation. Opening Ceremony partnered with queer film platform Dirty Looks to host the screening (Araki also recently lent his talents to a short film for Kenzo ). Humberto Leon, who met McGowan at an expat Fourth of July barbecue in Paris, played matchmaker in introducing the pair. The result was an evening that’s the stuff of a film fan’s fondest dreams.\nWe caught up with McGowan before the event to talk about directing, writing, and her decision to speak up about Hollywood’s rampant sexism.\nWhat first got you interested in being on the other side of the camera?\nI think I was always interested in it; I just hadn’t really fully formed the idea of actually making the jump. The writers of Dawn, who are friends of mine, came to me and said, “It’s time.” They recognized that I had basically been doing it in my head the whole time, but now it was time to do it for real.\nWhat was your biggest takeaway from the process of making the film? Now that you’ve got one under your belt, is there anything that you would have done differently?\nThere really isn’t anything I would have done differently. I know film from beginning to end in a way very few people will ever have the opportunity [to know it]. I’ve spent more than 57,000 hours on set, and I know movies and TV—from getting the funding to being on the cover of Rolling Stone . So no, actually, I wouldn’t have done anything differently.\nHas Araki’s work been an inspiration to you as a filmmaker?\nWell, I’ve certainly been a fan of his work since I did a movie of his [ laughs ]. I was very young when I was discovered [and cast in] that movie. I wasn’t trying to be an actress; it was random, and it propelled me into a very different world, and that’s a Gregg Araki world. I would say Dawn is punk in its subversion, but Gregg does really stylized, in-your-face punk. We have a different way of approaching it, but it’s cool to see the parallels in it.\nMcGowan in Araki&apos;s The Doom Generation.\nPhoto: Courtesy of Lionsgate Films\nIn recent months you’ve spoken out about just one experience with sexism in Hollywood [tweeting about a misogynistic Adam Sandler project casting notice]. Can you talk a little more about that and your decision to be open about something that actors don’t normally discuss?\nI just kind of realized that I didn’t join the mafia, and I didn’t take a vow of silence. Thus far, no one’s paid me off for any kind of silence on my part. It’s looking around a little bit and realizing that some things need to change. It might have seemed to come out of left field, but I think I’ve been saying the same kind of stuff all along; it’s just right now getting attention.\nIs that a sexism that you see on both sides of the camera?\nI think it’s very different. Actresses—there’s a kind of a purchase mentality, like, we own you . Not for everybody, and not everybody’s like that. But in the way I’ve experienced it, there’s an ownership thing. There is no such thing as human resources in our world. But for directors, where it gets really insidious is if somebody finances a movie with a woman director, and it doesn’t go well, they’re like, “Well, we tried a woman director, and that didn’t work out.” So how many stupid men directors have you used who haven’t worked out? I would say the ratio is probably much higher. So try again.\nHave you experienced any kind of industry blowback since calling out that particular casting notice?\nWell, I got fired by my agency, so I guess there was that blowback, which I thought was quite amusing, to tell you the truth. At first I was a little freaked out, and then I just thought it was funny. It’s also silly. Like, really, that’s what you’re going to do? I don’t know if I’ve experienced blowback, because frankly I haven’t been [to Los Angeles]. I’ve been in New York, writing. It’s a little nervous-making. If I go back, am I going to walk down the street and they’re going to be throwing their Panerai watches at me? I have no idea.\nFemale sexuality is a key theme of Dawn . What main things about that theme did you want to evoke, and what do you think are the most common mistakes in the way female sexuality is portrayed in movies?\nThe most common way that female sexuality is portrayed in movies is with an eye to a guy that’s the director, and another person behind the camera trying to interpret what either turns them on or what they imagine turns on an audience full of guys. That leaves 50 percent of the population out of the equation, and you’re also sexualizing people in a way that’s just really stereotypical and boring. America is a great country, but a very young country, and its idea of sexuality is quite twisted. You grow breasts and suddenly you have a scarlet letter, and that means it’s OK to be interpreted a certain way. But it’s really not.\nDawn is really about what we do to young girls unwittingly, and how we send them out into the world completely unprotected, in a way that has, at times, really tragic consequences. Being polite at the risk of your own internal voice of danger being silenced is a pretty dangerous thing.\nA still from Dawn .\nPhoto: Courtesy of Black Dog Films\nDo you have any other directorial projects in the works?\nI do. I’m probably going to be filming a movie called The Pines this winter. It’s with great producers, and we’re casting that now and going into pre-production, so it’s really an exciting time. And I’m writing some other things myself, and doing a lot of fashion films, commercials, music videos. I just feel much more comfortable. I feel like I’m finally wearing pants that fit me right.\nYou mentioned that you’ve been in New York writing. Do you find the city is more conducive to that?\nWell, at least what I’m trying to write about, maybe. I’ve actually been out of the city, writing in a really beautiful place called Tuxedo, NY. It’s stunning there.\nYou’re a fashion-show fixture in many ways. Are there designers working today who are presenting an image of femininity that particularly speaks to you?\nI just wear whatever I like, which is really bad because sometimes it leads to some crazy outfit combinations. I don’t work with a stylist anymore, or a hairdresser or makeup artist. I just do everything myself, so if it sucks, it’s totally at my feet. I just don’t want someone else’s idea of what’s supposed to be on me anymore. Like, why am I paying somebody to make me look like me, but more marketable? No, it’s gross. I’m not into it.\nNot some watered-down version…\nRight, which is what you’re going to get. Somebody’s random interpretation of you—and you’re paying them, so it’s odd. The message an actress gets is, You’re not enough . You have to get professional people so you can step out the door. It messes with your mind. And the reality is, if you can do it yourself, you don’t [need professionals]. Just be you. That’s ostensibly why you were discovered, why you were cast: because of you.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/RQ41Y2Gp4io"], "published": "2015-07-25T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T21:01:35.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
