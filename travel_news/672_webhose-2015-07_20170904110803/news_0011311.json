Guests travelling on the inaugural flight were presented with special luggage tags and commemorative B787 certificates.\nMembers of the Swiss media were also given a tour of the Etihad Airways B787 aircraft where they had the opportunity to experience the airline’s new product offering.\nMr Baumgartner said: “Switzerland is one of the most important aviation markets for Etihad Airways and it is significant that we are deploying our state-of-the-art, new B787 Dreamliner on the Zurich route.\n“Our latest product is setting new benchmarks in service standards and we’re immensely proud to introduce it to Swiss travellers. We believe it will set us apart from our competitors in Switzerland and look forward to feedback from our guests who flew on today’s first flight.”\nEach First Suite on the Etihad Airways B787 has a large Poltrona Frau upholstered seat and ottoman, a personal wardrobe and a chilled mini-bar.
