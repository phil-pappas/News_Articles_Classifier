Finney Sr. hires our favourite ‘fixer,’ played by Liev Schreiber in the titular role, to help his family, particularly his daughter, out of a crisis.\nNew chapter: Holmes as Paige Finney. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nAudiences first met Holmes in 1998 in Dawson’s Creek , but she’s primarily known for such films as Batman Begins and more recently, The Giver (2014), other than her off-screen role as the ex-Mrs Tom Cruise .\nShe jumped at the chance to play the role of Paige Finney.\n“I’m a big fan of the show. I’ve never put limits on myself in this business in terms of TV or film. I go wherever the rewarding work is and where the interesting characters lie,” she says.\nOf the new season, Jon Voight, who plays Ray’s father, Mickey Donovan, says ‘the most important storyline is about Ray’. This is centred on Ray working for Finney — an opportunity he hopes will act as the springboard for him to finally go legit.\nAs for what’s in store for papa Donovan, Voight chuckles: “Mickey always winds up doing the wrong thing. But he has other intentions. This season he’s really trying to establish himself on his own.”\nConsumed: Schreiber in his starring role of Ray Donovan. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nSchreiber’s long-running stint on TV has changed his views on the acting profession.\n“I never subscribed to that school of acting where I was deeply immersive and wanted people to call me by my character’s name. I never really believed that characters could actually consume you until I played Ray Donovan,” he says.\n“But you put yourself in that situation 14 hours a day, over and over again, and you get his habitual reactions to things.”\nSchreiber’s role often calls for dark turbulent scenes, something he actively shakes off at the end of the day. “I try to do a meditation before and after we shoot, especially as violent and wound-up as Ray is,” he says.\nHolmes seems to have an easier time of: “I’m able to do my work and I don’t really live with it when I go home.”\nRave reviews have already emerged from advance screenings of the new season, with leading man Schreiber admitting he did not anticipate the hit show’s success.\n“Oh, I’m always surprised if something I’m in is successful,” he laughs.\nRAY DONOVAN, MONDAY, 8.30PM, SHOWCASE\nLATEST CELEBRITY PICTURES\nOriginally published as Katie Holmes in gritty TV role return", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227435/481489-60610b3c-207c-11e5-97a8-3165311c9b30.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227435/478435-6477a712-207c-11e5-97a8-3165311c9b30.jpg", "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0574534/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lEG5NM7oAE", "http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/katie-holmes-joins-liev-schreibers-bad-boy-in-ray-donovans-return/story-e6frfmyi-1227435481515"], "published": "2015-07-12T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T00:19:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
