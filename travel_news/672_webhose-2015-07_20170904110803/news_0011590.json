The airline group benefited from a €309 million reduction in fuel costs for the six-month period. \nSimone Menne, chairman of airline’s financial and aviation services, called the “solid” although she admitted this mainly due to the fall in fuel costs. \n“Our strategic focus is right. On the one hand, our premium brands – Lufthansa and Swiss – are very successful, and at the same time Germanwings and Eurowings are also showing good business developments as secondary brands,” added Menne. \n“We are focusing on the premium quality of our hub airlines and the high level of competitiveness of our secondary brands in point-to-point traffic. This approach makes us profitable and fit for the future within the airline market.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:32:14.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
