A native of Samura, Samwel is one of 500 graduates from SETCO, which is a non-government institution based in the township of Mgumu. With a choice of subjects ranging from front office operations to tour guiding and driving, housekeeping and food and beverage, students are able to complete a one or two year course (depending on area of study) following which SETCO assists them to find permanent employment in tour companies, lodges, hotels and camps across the country.\n“Our partnership with SETCO is a fantastic opportunity for us to support the future of Tanzanian hospitality. We have played an active role in guiding students through the internship process and it is exciting that we have now gained a full time employee from our SETCO partnership,” comments Lodge Manager Martin Cody.\nThe students working on placement at the Lodge covered a variety of positions, including Housekeeping, Laundry, Kitchen, Stewarding, plus the opportunity to join the Maasai warriors in Security.\nSource:-Four seasons\nRelated Posts 40% reduction in room rates in Grand Hyatt Taipei in July and August Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium Express your love this Valentine’s Day at Calabash Cove Resort & Spa Melia Hotels International becomes a partner of the World Community Grid, initiative sponsored by IBM Four Seasons safari lodge serengeti welcomes nice Garbutt as part of the “wildlife photographer in residence” program", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T16:52:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
