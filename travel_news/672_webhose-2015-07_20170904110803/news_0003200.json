Mr. Manfred had an opportunity to show the courage of his position and immediately compel teams to save lives and prevent injuries. Instead, he hides behind 'minimum standards' double talk, puts the onerous on the individual stadiums to make the decision he is afraid to make, and throws every loyal fan in front of a potential lethal foul ball with the hollow promise of 'maybe we will protect you next year'.\"\"Mr. Manfred claims he does not like to be reactive and so, instead will do nothing. Before the end of this season, as a result of this pass-the-buck mentality, one night, a foul ball, traveling at close to 100 mph will hit an innocent fan, and the consequence will be devastating.\"\"Netting could easily go up before the all star break is over and injuries would be prevented and lives saved. Now, the commissioner of baseball has determined to do nothing, despite indisputable evidence of the continued danger caused by his inaction.\" About HMG Hilliard Munoz Gonzales LLP (HMG) specializes in mass torts, personal injury, product liability, commercial and business litigation, and wrongful death.
