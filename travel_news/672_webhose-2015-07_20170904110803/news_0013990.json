(CNN) If you're planning a trip to Miami, you have a lot of fun choices to make -- which restaurants to try, which beaches to lay out on, which clubs to hang out in, which shops to hit. But one choice is getting harder to narrow down -- where to stay. That's because the Miami hotel scene is booming. The Greater Miami Convention & Visitors Bureau reports the city is expecting a whopping 2,500 new hotel rooms this year alone, with 800 more already on tap for 2016. Reportedly home to the largest concentration of boutique hotels in the world, Miami has upped its game with new lodgings of every style, brand and price point popping up from downtown to the Design District and beyond. Here are a few of Miami's hottest new hotels. Nautilus, a SIXTY Hotel Why we care: Coming to trendy Collins Avenue this fall, this 250-room architectural gem is a remake of an iconic Morris Lapidus design. Multimillion-dollar enhancements include a new outdoor saltwater pool with bar, 24-hour fitness center and play area with hammocks overlooking the beach.
