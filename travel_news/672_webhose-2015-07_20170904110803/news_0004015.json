The device has been linked to deep joint infections that can lead to revision surgeries, permanent disability, amputation, and other problems. Kennedy Hodges has filed cases on behalf of two claimants thus far who have been severely injured and impaired beyond normal daily functions through the course of being exposed to this warming device. Routine surgeries use this 3M device to keep patients' body temperature at equilibrium or \"normalthermia;\" however, the complaint alleges that during routine procedures, the hot air produced by the Bair Hugger™ FAW (forced air warming) accumulates under the surgical drape, travels to the floor, and lifts bacteria off the floor and into the surgical wound. The cases have been filed in both the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas and the United States District Court for the District of Kansas . David W. Hodges , founding partner, noted, \"We were the first in the country to bring these claims, but we will not be the last. There is growing momentum as more scientific literature is published.\"These claims, now attracting national attention, have concerned many, especially elderly or others who have experienced catastrophic results. The device has specifically been linked to surgical procedures involving hip, knee, and joint replacements during the last five years. It is estimated that over 100,000 people have been affected by this allegedly defective product. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T22:57:32.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
