But there was little information available about how Trump calculated the figure.\n Trump’s campaign says the federal forms are “not designed for a man of Mr. Trump’s massive wealth.”\nIf accurate, the figure would surpass previous wealthy candidates like Ross Perot, business heirs like Steve Forbes or private-equity investors like Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee.\n“I have a Gucci store worth more than Romney,” Trump told the Des Moines Register last month, referring to the fashion company’s flagship store in New York’s Trump Tower.\nJEFF HORWITZ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T13:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T22:42:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
