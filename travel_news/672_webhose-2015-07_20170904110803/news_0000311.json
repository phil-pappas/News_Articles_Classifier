The American, who has recently appointed English IM Lawrence Trent as his agent, took the lead with a game to play. Caruana started slowly and lost to Wesley So in round two, but has 4.5/6, half a point ahead of his final opponent Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu. • Fabiano Caruana shows his silky skills Nisipeanu was a grateful recipient of a Kramnik error in the sixth round when the 14th world champion let him off the hook in a rook-and-pawn endgame. Kramnik is usually ruthlessly efficient in these circumstances. Kramnik played for the win from the outset here. 13.Bxe4!? was bold, 13.Nxe4 dxe4 14.Bxe4 Qxd4 15.Qxd4 Bxd4 16.Bb2!
