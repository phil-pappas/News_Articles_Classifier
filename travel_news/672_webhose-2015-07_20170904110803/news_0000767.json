Ruby red slippers Adv: \nJul 12, 2015 Adv: \nAn anonymous donor has offered a $1 million reward for credible information leading to the recovery of a pair of Judy Garland’s sequined, ruby red slippers stolen from a museum in her Minnesota hometown. \nThe late actress wore the slippers in The Wizard of Oz. Three other pairs still exist, including one on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. \nJohn Kelsch, executive director of the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, says the donor is from Arizona and is a huge fan of Garland and the 1939 movie. \nThe reward offer requires the exact location of the slippers and the perpetrator’s name. \nThe 10-year anniversary of the theft is in August. The slippers were insured for $1 million. Kelsch says they could be worth $2 million to $3 million now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T21:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T22:27:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
