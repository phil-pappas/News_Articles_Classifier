Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: \"We believe the IAG offer for Aer Lingus is a reasonable one in the current market and we plan to accept it in the best interests of Ryanair shareholders. The price means that Ryanair will make a small profit on its investment in Aer Lingus over the past 9 years.\" IAG upped the offer in February this year for the stake after two previous bids were rejected. That latest offer valued Aer Lingus at about US1.5 billion. A major hurdle was overcome two months ago when the Irish government sold its 25.1% shareholding in Aer Lingus after British airways owner IAG gave assurances which included that it would keep routes between Heathrow and Dublin and  remain headquartered in Ireland. Ryanair has over the last 10 years made three unsuccessful offer for the firm and O'Leary noted that when his firm first bid for Aer Lingus in late 2006 Ryanair carried 4 times Aer Lingus traffic and that today it carried more than  10 times Aer Lingus traffic. \"We will continue to deliver the vast majority of Ireland's traffic and tourism growth in the coming months and years\" he told today's stock market statement. IAG has previously said: \"The acquisition is expected to provide substantial benefits to both IAG and Aer Lingus customers through an enhanced network particularly to North America using Dublin as a natural gateway hub for transatlantic routes.\" IAG shares flew 3.01% higher to the top of the Footsie at 530p today.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T18:08:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
