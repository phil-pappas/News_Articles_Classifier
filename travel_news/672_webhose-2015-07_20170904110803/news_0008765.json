The first episode of Talking to Hollywood with Betty Zhou aired on the state broadcaster’s movie channel, CCTV-6, in early June. According to producers, the show aims to give viewers unprecedented access to the industry’s A-listers. I just have fun with the celebrities, which you probably don’t see in other programmes “It’s unlike any other show (about Hollywood) in China,” said host and producer Betty Zhou. “I just have fun with the celebrities, which you probably don’t see in other programmes.” In the first episode, Zhou helped Arnold Schwarzenegger open an account on Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like website in China. “I’m thrilled to be bringing a little Hollywood glamour to Chinese audiences,” she said. Zhou, who was born in China but started her TV career in Singapore, is a bilingual presenter best known for hosting CCTV’s basketball coverage. She is also a model and actress, and appeared alongside RZA and Russell Crowe in the 2012 movie The Man With the Iron Fists. “When you see her (Zhou) travelling to these places, you are in that environment,” said Rob Moore, vice-chairman of Paramount Pictures and co-creator of the show. We want them to have better and more personal experiences with Hollywood To engage Chines e audiences, he said it was not enough to just air American shows with subtitles. “We need someone from China, who speaks Mandarin and has the ability to connect with Western celebrities.” The show “delivers an inside look at the movie business to its most passionate and dedicated fans in China,” he added. “We want them to have better and more personal experiences with Hollywood.” The first 10 episodes were to air over a period of six months and Moore said extended versions could be released online.
