We're excited to partner with Virgin Hotels to bring the latest Gap styles and essentials directly to travellers' hotel rooms,\" said Tricia Nichols, Global Lead of Consumer Engagement and Partnerships for Gap. — AFP-Relaxnews More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T06:13:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
