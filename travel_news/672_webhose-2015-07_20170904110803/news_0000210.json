(Instagram/Kendall Jenner) Like all true style icons, wherever Kendall Jenner leads, 32 million Instagram fans follow, and now the model has once more proven the extent of her influence by starting the new trend for \"heart hair\" selfies.The US beauty kick-started the movement earlier in the summer when she posted this picture of herself lying on the floor in a gorgeous white lacy dress with her brunette locks spread out around her face, arranged into a halo of heart shapes. She captioned the photo with a simple heart emoji. A photo posted by @thinay11 on Jul 27, 2015 at 6:01am PDT The cute snap struck a chord with hair and beauty lovers everywhere, and has since garnered a staggering 2.9 million double taps to become the most-liked photo on Instagram -- bumping big sister Kim, who previously held the title for her wedding snap with Kanye, off the top spot.Long-haired social media users immediately set about recreating the pose themselves, and #hearthair is now definitely a thing, with 7,683 photos and counting. From a great way to show off rainbow hair to braids, Instagrammers are delicately arranging their tendrils into romantic compositions.
