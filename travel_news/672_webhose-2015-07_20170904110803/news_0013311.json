We are honoured to be participating in the National Day Parade during Singapore’s Golden Jubilee year, with the world’s largest passenger aircraft in the aerial flypast and our iconic Singapore Girl cabin crew in the Vintage Parade,” said Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon Phong.\nThe public will be able to view the A380 in the aerial flypast for the first time on 1 August during the Preview Show, ahead of the official flypast during NDP 2015 on 9 August.\nSingapore Airlines will have two aircraft in the special livery through the end of this year, serving Beijing, Hong Kong, London, Mumbai, New Delhi, Shanghai, Sydney and Zurich routes.\nParticipation in NDP is among many initiatives by Singapore Airlines to celebrate Singapore’s 50th birthday.\nIn addition to the aircraft in special livery, an A380 Charity Flight took place on 29 May, on which some 300 beneficiaries of Community Chest experienced a 3.5-hour flight. Beneficiaries included children with special needs, adults with disabilities, as well as disadvantaged elderly and families, many of whom had never had the opportunity to take a flight.\nSingapore Airlines also organised an art competition, in conjunction with the first-ever Open House of the Airline’s training facilities on 25 July 2015. The theme of the competition was “Celebrating SG50 with SIA: Growing with the Nation”.\nFor customers, there have been special promotions to encourage both overseas Singaporeans and visitors to travel to Singapore for the SG50 celebrations.\nOn board, customers can enjoy a specially curated selection of Singapore movies, TV programmes, and music on our award-winning inflight entertainment system, KrisWorld, throughout the year. Special menus have also been developed featuring Singapore’s unique cuisine, while SG50-themed amenity kits are being introduced for the Airline’s new Premium Economy Class, which enters service on 9 August.\nActivities to celebrate Singapore’s 50th birthday began last year, and included the SIA Charity Run and Charity Gala Dinner, which raised some $2.5 million for Community Chest.\nSource:- Singapore Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T18:11:46.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
