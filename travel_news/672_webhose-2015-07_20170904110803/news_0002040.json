American Airlines' game plan for its just-announced ad agency review i s coming into sharper focus, and there's still good reason for Chicago ad agencies to be hopeful they have a shot at nabbing the high-profile account. In an interview this morning, Jen Adams , American Airlines' (NASDAQ: AAL) managing director of marketing, said that the first phase of what will essentially be a two-pronged agency review is just getting underway. Adams said letters and other information are being sent out this week to between 15 and 20 ad agencies that the world's largest airline believes meet the requirements to handle AA's global advertising account, which could eventually be worth well in excess of $30 million in billings annually. American marketing executives will spend the next several weeks conducting informational dialogues and meetings with those 15 to 20 agencies before narrowing the list to four to six finalists for the account. Adams underscored that whatever agency is selected will indeed need to have a global reach to adequately service the American Airlines account. The finalist agencies then will formally pitch the business to American's marketing executives. The current timeline calls for a new agency to be named in October. Interestingly Adams indicated today that the incumbent New York City-based McCann Group already has been assured it at least will reach the shortlist of four to six ad shops. Beyond that, nothing is guaranteed. McCann and its affiliate shops have worked with AA since the early 1980s. Adams also would not confirm whether American Airlines CEO Doug Parker would sit in on final pitches for the ad account. She seemed to suggest that AA's top marketing executives, including herself and Fernand Fernandez , would be key players in deciding what agency gets the business. Adams said AA's current ad campaign \"Going for Great\" launched last fall. It has been primarily targeted at business and other high-end travelers who fly in the airline's high-margin premium cabins. The current campaign has incorporated print, digital and out-of-home components. Adams said AA isn't using television at the moment and has no new TV commercials. In just a matter of weeks, AA's marketing team no longer will have any reason to worry about the U.S. Airways brand, which will completely disappear in October, Adams said, except for a handful of U.S. Airways-branded planes that will not have been painted with AA livery by then. \nWant Chicago Travel news in your inbox?
