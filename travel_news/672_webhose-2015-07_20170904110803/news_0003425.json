The water vapor would be lost from the planet forever,” he added.\n“Kepler 452b could be experiencing now what the Earth will undergo more than a billion years from now, as the Sun ages and grows brighter.”\nPlanetary catalog\nThe Kepler mission launched in 2009 to search for exoplanets, which are planets outside our solar system, particularly those about the size of Earth or smaller.\n“Today, and thousands of discoveries later, astronomers are on the cusp of finding something people have dreamed about for thousands of years — another Earth,” NASA said in a statement.\nOn Thursday, NASA released the latest catalog of exoplanet candidates, adding more than 500 new possible planets to the 4,175 already found by the space-based telescope.\n“This catalog contains our first analysis of all Kepler data, as well as an automated assessment of these results,” said SETI Institute scientist Jeffrey Coughlin.\nThe new catalog includes 12 candidates that are less than twice the diameter of Earth and which are orbiting in the habitable zones of their stars.\nOf those 12 new candidates, Kepler 452b “is the first to be confirmed as a planet,” NASA said.\nKepler identifies possible planets by watching for dips in the brightness of stars, which could be caused by a planet passing between the star and the telescope.\nOther scientific tools are needed to judge whether the planet is gassy or rocky.\nThe Kepler mission has cost NASA about $600 million, and the US space agency said in 2013 that two of its orientation wheels had lost function, leaving the space telescope beyond repair.\nBut scientists have years to pore over the data it has returned in order to narrow the search for Earth-like worlds.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/G_zcEgx1IgQ?feature=oembed"], "published": "2015-07-24T01:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T11:52:10.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
