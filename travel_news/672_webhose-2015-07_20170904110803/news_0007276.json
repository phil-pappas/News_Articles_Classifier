The Smiler ride at Alton Towers \nThe incident on the Smiler rollercoaster forced the company to close the park and also shut down rides at two others. \nMerlin now expects ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) in its resort theme parks operating group will be in the region of £40 to £50 million, compared with a previous estimate of £87 million. \nThe knock on effects could also be felt in 2016, the company warned. \nHowever, the impact this year will be partially mitigated by better-than-expected financing costs. Underlying operating profit for the group is set to be in line with last year’s total of £249 million. \nNick Varney, chief executive, said: “As a result of the accident, we took the immediate decision to close the park and temporarily suspend a number of rides across the UK Resort Theme Parks estate. \n“We firmly believe that this was the right course of action reflecting the seriousness of the incident, the impact on our staff, and to allow the team to focus on supporting all those affected and on the implementation of the new safety protocols, where necessary. \n“In addition, we felt it appropriate to significantly reduce UK theme park marketing activity, in what is a critical period in the run up to the peak summer season. \n“Alton Towers Resort was reopened on 8 June 2015, but as a result of the material loss of momentum, trading at the park and, to a lesser extent, the broader UK Resort Theme Parks estate has been adversely impacted.” Readers' comments (1) Anonymous | Mon, 27 Jul 2015 12:18 pm \nNot always about the bottom line.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T13:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T15:34:52.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
