Do you want to get fit, improve your mental strength and develop some amazing self-defence skills too? If so, taking up a martial art should be high on your to-do list. There’s plenty of choice in the varied world of martial arts, so you should be able to find one that’s perfect for you. Maybe it’s a bout of high-energy, combative kung fu that ignites your inner Jackie Chan. Or perhaps the gentler, more meditative art of tai chi is the one for you. If you’re not sure, many clubs and venues will let you have a taster session before you fully commit. The good news is that you can take whichever discipline you do pick as seriously as you like. You can take part in grading sessions or competitions, if that side appeals. Or, if moving up through the belts is not for you, you can simply hone your skills as a way to keep fit. Martial arts training is a brilliant alternative to your regular gym sessions – and it will be far more interesting than your usual treadmill run. Here’s our quick guide to a few of the most popular martial arts out there. Aikido With its roots in Japan, aikido isn’t a martial art based on brute strength like some others. In fact, the aim is more to deflect your opponent than attack them; you actually use their energy and turn it against them. It’s a discipline largely based on harmonising your movements with your opponent and isn’t about all-out attack. It will build your stamina and flexibility as well as your overall calmness. Karate Also from Japan, the word karate literally means “empty hand”; your hands and feet are your only weapons. Regarded as an excellent form of self defence, it can provide a good cardiovascular workout as well as quicken your reactions. Learning the basics, repeating them and then sparring with an opponent is seen as good for mental strength too. Judo Many of us tried this as kids, but it’s a great sport to rediscover later in life, too. This martial art demands mental toughness and physical strength as you throw or unbalance your opponent with some fancy footwork before holding them down in a controlled manner until they submit. It’s great for overall fitness as well as honing the ability to unleash some explosive power. Taekwondo This Korean martial art is said to be the most popular one in the world. It’s characterised by kicks and strikes to put your opponent down before keeping them in a hold on the mat. Taekwondo builds up your strength and provides you with the perfect set of skills for self protection. It also demands that you follow the ancient code of respecting your opponent at all times.
