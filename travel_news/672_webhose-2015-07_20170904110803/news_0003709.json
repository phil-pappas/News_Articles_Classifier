Boats docked at island gardens, and people took slow promenades along the shore, followed by a leisurely Sunday meal on the leafy veranda of, say, Albergo Verbano, where Arturo Toscanini, George Bernard Shaw, and Ernest Hemingway once stayed.\nThe lakes' legacy goes back to the ancient Romans. Almost as old is the rivalry among them - Como, Garda, and Maggiore - for first place in the beauty pageant.\nEach lake boasts a Mediterranean microclimate cradled by soaring, snow-crusted Alps. In the 17th century, however, the prominent Borromeo family transformed a minuscule rocky island on Lago Maggiore into a baroque botanical masterpiece. The island, Isola Bella, and its gardens rose to international Grand Tour destination fame.\nA short train ride from Milan to Stresa makes Lago Maggiore an easy retreat. To avoid crowds and humidity, visit in spring or early fall.\nIt's an early morning in May, and I'm standing on the veranda of the venerable Grand Hotel des Iles Borromees, facing the Alps. Behind me is Mount Mottarone, famous for its stunning 360-degree panoramas. In front of me, boats crisscross the Borromean Gulf. Besotted amateur gardener that I am, I'm here for the gulf's three botanical sanctuaries: Isola Bella, Isola Madre, and Villa Taranto.\nThe Borromeo name is inescapable; the family owns multiple properties and remains the darling of high-society papers. My sights are set on their award-winning head horticulturist, Gianfranco Giustina, who oversees Isola Bella's and Isola Madre's gardens.\nOn Isola Bella, Giustina saunters past squealing schoolchildren and meandering tourists. Tall and spry, he scans the manicured walkways in order to remove any fallen leaves as he explains the difference between Isola Bella's 17th-century baroque gardens, in which \"man's genius for architecture is in important collaboration with formal garden structures,\" and Isola Madre's 19th-century English gardens, which \"make plants the protagonists in a feat of natural landscaping.\"\nBoth gardens employ 23 full-time gardeners, plus 10 part-timers, for the kind of offseason work that requires barges of soil, helicopter transports, topiary sculpting, and tree trimming. \"Italy was ever the garden of Europe,\" he says, \"but we almost forgot this in favor of industrialization.\"\nI'm a newbie walking the hallowed ground of Isola Bella. Montesquieu, Edward Gibbon, Stendhal, Napoleon and Josephine, Wagner, Jean Cocteau, Dickens, Hemingway, the Prince of Wales and Lady Diana all strolled these meticulous gardens.\nThe same as today, they would have approached by boat, gaining the full impression of this \"galleon floating on the blue water,\" as the promotional material puts it. Because that's what the island looks like - a ship.\nTen terraces, mimicking a ship's decks, elegantly display a wealth of rarities and exciting hybrids. Intoxicating scents abound. The Camphor terrace is famous for its ancient tree, once a new species Marco Polo wrote home about. The mad statuary of Milanese Carlo Simonetta's Amphitheater overlooks the intricate geometric hedges of the Garden of Love. Roses and espaliered citrus perfume the air. I learn that horses once powered the irrigation system.\nFor the first time this year, visitors to Isola Bella can also see an art exhibit, \"The Enchanted Islands: The Grand Tour and Landscape Painting,\" with everything from sublime landscapes to putti playing in a pastoral arcadia to portrayals of prettily bonneted Borromeos. The show comes down Oct. 25.\nIf Isola Bella is perfectly coiffed, Isola Madre lets her hair down. Giustina confirms that the natural look's art of deception isn't much easier to achieve. Isola Bella is a grand public performance, but Isola Madre feels magically private.\nArches of wisteria lead into winding paths bordered by 20-foot hedges. These lush walls of laurel, myrtle, and camellia create hide-and-seek turns, from which pop Chinese pheasants, long-tailed red and yellow parrots, and white and blue-green peacocks, creating a busy ornithological soundscape. The sunnier lake exposures boast the Africa road, avenue of palms, and citrus tree walk.\nI shop at the Orangerie for locally sourced gifts: teas, soaps, candles, and a fascinating illustrated \"botanical-uses\" map for $1.70. It walks me past the peppertree, from which a poison, a hallucinogen, and a coronary diluting substance can be culled. It shows me the candleberry, which yields scented wax. And who knew the seeds of the carob tree, which lent their name to the carat, were once used as a unit of weight for gold and diamonds?\nPreserving these venerable gardens is no easy matter. In 2006, a tornado uprooted Isola Madre's massive rare Kashmir cypress, planted in 1862. The ensuing struggle to save the now-reinstated tree was a major success for Giustina, who worked with a cadre of botanists, engineers, and technicians.\nIn 2012, a tornado felled more than 300 trees on Villa Taranto. It's my next stop, in Pallanza, across the Borromean Gulf.\nI wave goodbye to the British couple I overheard in a game of one-upmanship to name each plant. Celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary, they continue a legacy of visits initiated by many British romantics and Victorians, including the eponymous queen herself. To John Ruskin's critical eye, Lago Maggiore was the \"Eden of Italy . . . purest air, richest earth, loveliest wave.\"\nScotsman and avid botanist Capt. Neil McEacharn did more than visit. He settled into Villa Taranto and, in 1931, began his life's \"occupation and adventure,\" transforming its 16 wooded hectares into a glorious park with multiple microclimates.\nToday, his legacy is overseen by horticulturist Franco Caretti.\nVisitors receive a calendar of monthly flowerings, which I'm carrying. The 24,000 spring tulips have bloomed and are being unearthed and wheeled off. Other gardeners are lining up 1,700 dahlia tubers on the ground, a curving row of expectant brown stars scheduled to flower July to October.\nVilla Taranto's parklike gardens ascend nearly 330 feet of hillside shaded by enormous conifers. Along the paths, people pause to take in the sparkling putti fountain, a mosaic of Italianate rectangular terraces, cooling magnolia woods, mossy sunken fern valleys, and hand-waving Japanese maples.\nMcEacharn's reputation as a \"living encyclopedia of horticulture\" grew into a global mission he undertook with all seriousness. In 1959 alone, he shipped 11,484 packets of seeds from Villa Taranto to 250 gardens in 40 countries.\nCaretti points to favorite successes: a flourishing dawn redwood long thought extinct; the shy-to-flower Man Yang tree, which resists cultivation yet suddenly bloomed in 1971; and the huge Santa Cruz (or water platter) water lily, apparently utilized as floating cradles by Paraguayan mothers doing laundry. \"The baby we tested it on wasn't a fan,\" Caretti says with a grin.\nThe evening boat picks up stragglers. Sunset ripples over Lago Maggiore, and the Alps turn dark green-purple. A night's rest for the Eden of Italy.\nA mesmerized couple blurts: \"It's our first trip to Italy. We've seen Milan and Venice. Had we known, we'd have headed here straight off.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T07:12:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
