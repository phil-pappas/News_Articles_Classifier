The hotel was quite close to the massacre scene at Sousse.\nSecurity\nWhen they were moved to a new hotel, there was very little visible security. The family were too afraid to leave the hotel and armed guards only arrived two days before their departure, she said.\n\"I felt safer with soldiers stationed around the pool, but my children were a bit scared seeing all the guns,\" she said.\nThe family left Tunisia a week early. She said she will be seeking a refund from the tour operator for the second week.\n\"I don't want a credit note because I may not go away on a foreign holiday ever again... There isn't a hope in hell the children will want to go abroad again,\" she said.\n\"I really feel sorry for the people of Tunisia.
