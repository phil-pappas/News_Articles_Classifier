To celebrate Matilda’s Top 5 Guide to Sydney, inspired by Roald Dahl’s beloved character, has been released by Destination NSW and the Matilda team to share with fans, and announce news that Qantas is the show’s Official Airline partner and major sponsor.\nMatilda is an extraordinary girl with a vivid imagination and sharp mind. She started sharing her story with audiences last night when first performances of the Royal Shakespeare Company’s musical adaptation began in Sydney.\nDestination NSW CEO, Sandra Chipchase said: “Matilda is an extraordinary girl and Sydney is an extraordinary city, so it’s a perfect time for Matilda The Musical fans and travellers to book their trip to New South Wales to see the award-winning production and experience Australia’s major events capital, Sydney.\n“With many people visiting Sydney for the Australian-premiere season of Matilda The Musical , Matilda’s guide gives visitors hints and tips on where to visit.”\nDestination New South Wales, the State Government’s tourism and major events agency, the Matilda team and Qantas have worked together to develop travel packages to promote visitation to Sydney for the show from intrastate, interstate and overseas, and a competitive range of travel packages are available to local and international visitors.\nLouise Withers, Australian Producer of Matilda the Musical, said: “ We’re delighted to announce a new partnership with Qantas, now the Official Airline of Matilda The Musical . Qantas has a long and celebrated history of partnerships with commercial theatrical productions in Australia and we are proud to have them as a partner. The airline will collaborate with Matilda, offering a broad range of packages to promote visitation to Sydney. And as a special celebration, Destination NSW has released the Matilda’s Guide to Sydney”.\nStephen Limbrick, Executive Manager Customer & Commercial Relationships, Qantas, said: “As the national carrier we are excited to be helping Australians from around the country and visitors from around world visit Sydney, to enjoy the beautiful music and lyrics of Tim Minchin through the story of Matilda, one of Roald Dahl’s much loved characters.”\nMatilda’s Top 5 Guide to Sydney:\nLuna Park Sydney: The famous 1930s amusement park is a great spot for someone like Matilda to be an adventurous thrill-seeker. Whether riding the gut-wrenching Tango Train, taking a more relaxing ride on the Ferris Wheel or learning about the heritage-listed sites’ history through an onsite tour, Luna Park Sydney is a favourite place for fun. Observatory Hill: Matilda loves to escape with a great book. In Sydney, a great place to do exactly that (with a Roald Dahl classic!) is Observatory Hill, where anyone can read the afternoon away whilst enjoying the stunning Harbour view. Sydney Theatre Walk: The Sydney Theatre Walk at Walsh Bay honours 22 legends of Australian stage and screen with commemorative plaques set into the paving stone along the waterfront. Someone like Matilda would love to take a stroll and learn about local performing arts talent including Geoffrey Rush, Jacki Weaver, Cate Blanchett and of course Matilda’s composer and lyricist, Tim Minchin. Located along Pier 2/3, be sure to walk to the end of the wharf to get a photo with the Sydney Harbour Bridge in the background, like the young performers playing Matilda – Molly Barwick, Sasha Rose, Georgia Taplin and Bella Thomas – did recently. Sydney Museums and Libraries: Matilda has a thirst for knowledge and loves to learn so Sydney Museums and local libraries are ideal places to visit to discover Sydney’s rich history. The Museum of Sydney, Hyde Park Barracks Museum, Justice and Police Museum or Susannah Place Museum are full of facts about Sydney’s past and present. The State Library of NSW, the oldest library in Australia, boasts its own incredible story and is full of books from all over the world, so it’s an ideal spot for any inquisitive visitor to spend some time. Bondi to Coogee Coastal Walk: Fresh air is a great way to recharge and re-fuel someone’s imagination, and a trip to Sydney is not complete without seeing the city’s iconic sandy beaches, rock pools and quiet bays. So Matilda fans should be sure to take some time for a stroll along the Bondi to Coogee Coastal Walk. Whilst there, keep an eye out for whales that might be making their annual migration north, along the famous coastline.\nMatilda fans from near and far are encouraged to book their trip to Sydney now to take advantage of Qantas Holidays’ competitive rates and offers, with flights, accommodation and show tickets starting from $535 (AUD) per person twin share*.\nSource:- Destination NSW", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T22:14:07.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
