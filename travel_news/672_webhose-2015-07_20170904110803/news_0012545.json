In addition, the agreement enables Brazilian participation in missions studying the sun's impacts on Earth's space environment such as the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission. \nBrazil also will now be the newest partner in the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) program. The environmental science and education program brings together teachers, students and scientists to use Earth and space-based observations to study the global environment and promotes understanding of our planet as a system. \nNASA and AEB also will partner to increase opportunities for Brazilian undergraduate and graduate students to participate in an internship at a NASA center through the NASA International Internship Program. The new agreement, signed separately by NASA and AEB on June 18 will provide a unique educational experience for Brazilian students while providing U.S. students an opportunity to work on international teams.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T04:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T04:11:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
