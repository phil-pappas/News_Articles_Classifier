He came in first. \nHe moved to Las Vegas with a suitcase and a dream: to some day work with fellow Canadians such as Paul Anka and Rich Little. Two years after arriving, he did just that, and even went on to open for comedians Jerry Seinfeld, Jay Leno and Louie Anderson, country stars Kenny Rogers and Randy Travis and singer Barry Manilow. \nBrown brings a repertoire of live music, comedy and his impressions in a show that is offered Tuesdays through Thursdays, and Saturdays and Sundays. \nThose without a Canadian ID can see the show starting at $27.50.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T18:47:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
