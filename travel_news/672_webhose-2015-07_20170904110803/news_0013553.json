More than 50 classically styled buildings sit inside its 1.5-kilometer-long perimeter wall.\nIt's dominated by Solitary Beauty Peak (Duxiu Feng), a 216-meter-tall limestone outcrop topped by a temple.\nVisitors ascending the peak's 306 steps are rewarded by stunning views of Guilin city and the surrounding countryside.\nAs well as being a tourist attraction, Jingjiang is part of the campus of Guangxi Normal University.\nStudents relax on the lawns as travelers stroll by.\nDestruction and restoration\nNone of the site's main buildings are 14th century, as Jingjiang was badly damaged twice during the Qing Dynasty (which lasted from 1644 to 1912) and again during the Japanese invasion in World War II.\nA few stone stairways and balustrades are all that remain from the original complex, which was arranged as an inner city to protect the princes, their families and other dignitaries.\nFortunately, it's been rebuilt over the past century and will be safeguarded thanks to the national protection status it was granted in 1993.\nDespite the destruction it has suffered, it's still considered China's best preserved princes' city of the Ming Dynasty.\nChengyun Palace\nAdhering to the architectural style of the Ming Dynasty, it has a symmetrical layout with its key buildings forming the spine of the site.\nPerhaps the most iconic of these structures is Chengyun Gate, which marks the southern entrance to Jingjiang.\nIts striking golden-hued facade and tiered eaves hint at the majesty within the complex.\nAs they pass beneath its lofty arch, visitors meet the Princes' Path.\nTraditional dance demonstration inside Chengyun Palace. Walking along this narrow stone lane, flanked by manicured hedges and rows of red lanterns, it's easy to imagine the splendid royal processions it once hosted.\nThe path leads to Chengyun Palace, the most imposing of Jingjiang's buildings, which for centuries operated as its administrative center.\nRestored in 1947 according to its original design, the palace's intricately carved stone rails offer the last evidence of the tremendous craftsmanship involved in the original construction of Jingjiang.\nThe palace is now home to a museum detailing the history of Jingjiang, and also offers traditional Qing Dynasty dance demonstrations.\nThe Examination Hall\nOn either side of the palace are elegant tree-lined boulevards which flow towards Solitary Beauty Peak and, in its shadow, the former Royal Quarters.\nThe Quarters aren't always open to the public and hold less interest than the other sites that surround the peak.\nAncient stone inscriptions are to be found within two caves at the base of this towering rock formation.\nOne of the earliest recognized poems written in the Guilin area was carved into the wall of this cave about 1,600 years ago, celebrating the region's environmental gifts.\nStepping out of the cave and peering up at the majestic peak it becomes clear what inspired this poetry.\nAs they do to this day, artists flocked to this site in the Qing and Ming Dynasties to document its beauty in words and on canvas.\nIt also attracted scholars, who underwent searching tests within the whitewashed walls of the Examination Hall on the western side of the peak.\nTourists can enter the rebuilt hall to relive these scholarly endeavors by taking part in mock examinations, using brush pens.\nIt's a quirky way to finish a visit to Jingjiang, the royal complex that in its grandiosity rivals Guilin's natural splendor.\nJingjiang Wangcheng City , No. 1 wangcheng, Xiufeng District, Guilin 541001 China;", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150724181402-guilin-palace-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150721111135-guilin-palace-full-169.jpg", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298556-d1834794-Reviews-m14631-Jingjiang_Wangcheng_City-Guilin_Guangxi_Zhuang.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150724181402-guilin-palace-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150724181402-guilin-palace-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150721111135-guilin-palace-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150724181402-guilin-palace-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150721111135-guilin-palace-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150724181402-guilin-palace-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150721111135-guilin-palace-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150721111135-guilin-palace-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150724181402-guilin-palace-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150724181402-guilin-palace-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150721111135-guilin-palace-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150721111135-guilin-palace-small-11.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-26T18:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T05:01:57.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
