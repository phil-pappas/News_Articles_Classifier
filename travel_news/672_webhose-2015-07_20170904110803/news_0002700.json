The excellence and innovation revealed by the works and projects awarded are impressive and can certainly provide inspiration to raise the standards of the tourism industry stakeholders in the region. Macau Government Tourist Office congratulates all winning organisations and individuals for such outstanding achievements and we are honoured to be part of this prestigious PATA initiative for the 20th consecutive year.”\nMario Hardy, PATA CEO, added, “On behalf of PATA, I extend our warmest congratulations to all 2015 Grand and Gold Award winners and I also thank all participants. This year we received 269 entries from 83 travel and tourism organisations and individuals – the highest number since 2007.

It is the first Public Private Partnership (PPP) initiated by the Government through the Ministry of Higher Education jointly with Taylor’s University to establish a Tourism Academy in Malaysia. The hotel industry, through this strategic partnership, has committed to support the learning and development of the students and eventually hire graduates at a more competitive remuneration package in recognition of the skills and learning that they attained directly with the hotel partners through the Tourism Academy.\nThis initiative will support the vision of the government to make Langkawi among the top 10 tourism island destination with qualified manpower to support and complement the service sectors.\nSource:-PATA\nRelated Posts San francisco travel achieves leed gold certification Macau tourism records the arrival of 500,000 Korean visitors in 2014 PATA Announces Grand and Gold Award Winners MGTO appoints new representative office in India ITB Berlin: Cross-border cooperation on the Danube", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T20:07:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
