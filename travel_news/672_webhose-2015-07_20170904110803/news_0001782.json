Calio, A4A president and CEO. “This plan proposes to use tomorrow´s dollars to pay for today´s problem and do so on the backs of airline passengers who are being asked to fund everything from the national debt to the highways. This plan is a road to nowhere for passengers and eventually will lead to fee increases if the fees airlines and their customers already are paying today are diverted to other uses.”Calio noted that airline customers are already paying more than their fair share in taxes, as a USD300 domestic one-stop roundtrip ticket can include more than USD61 in taxes.   \n  July 15, 2015 · No comments \nDHL   July 15, 2015 · No comments \nTrans-  July 15, 2015 · No comments \nAvolon   July 15, 2015 · No comments \nWSI Industries, Inc.
