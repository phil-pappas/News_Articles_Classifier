A witness — and perhaps your self interest as well.”\nCommissioner Heydon warned Mr Shorten that it was in his self-interest to concentrate on “giving a proper answer”.\nMr Shorten replied: “I’m conscious of the commissioner’s advice that if we want to be here two days, move along and answer questions.”\nBill Shorten (top left) has taken the stand for a second day. Source: Supplied\nMr Shorten has endured a tense second day in the stand following yesterday’s revelation that he had failed to declare a $40,000 donation from 2007 to his election campaign until two days before the hearing.\nThe hearing began with Mr Shorten being quizzed over a $100,000 a year deal — over three years from 2005 to 2008 — paid by building giants Thiess John Holland when Mr Shorten was Victorian and national secretary of the Australian Workers’ Union.\nThe union issued a string of invoices to the engineering contractors for ads in their union magazine, training and dinner dances to make up the payments.\nSenior Counsel Assisting the Commission Jeremy Stoljar said the invoices were being issued with “no regard” whether the events and services had “actually been provided.”\nOne invoice for $30,000 was for research done on “Back Strain in Civil Construction Industry” but no research has ever been provided.\n“Is this a bogus invoice that’s claiming payment for work that was never done?” Mr Stoljar asked.\nMr Shorten replied: “I would never be party to issuing any bogus invoices, full stop.”\nHe said a lot of the dinner dances for union delegates had taken place because he had attended most of them.\n“I wouldn’t be doing my job if I was asking workers to pay for their own tickets to a dinner dance or to pay for their own health and safety representative training for instance when I can get a company to do it,” Mr Shorten said.\nSenior Counsel Assisting Jeremy Stoljar: “Is this a bogus invoice claiming for work never done?”\nBill Shorten: “I would never be party to issuing bogus invoices, full stop.”\nMr Shorten defended his enterprise bargaining in the EastLink deal, telling the commission the agreement delivered a 16 per cent wage rise, including 11 per cent superannuation, for union members.\nMr Stoljar asked why Thiess had agreed on top of this to pay the series of $100,000-a-year instalments.\n“It is of no surprise, nor is it untoward, if a company is being further engaged after the EBA is signed,” Mr Shorten said.\n“And I am very confident that in my time as leader of the AWU in Victoria that if we were sending out invoices for services, my expectation is that work would be done consistent with the invoices rendered.”\nBill Shorten arrives hours early for the royal commission this morning. Picture: John Grainger Source: News Corp Australia\nMr Shorten was also accused of having “a conflict of interest” over an EBA he negotiated with a Victorian company called ACI Glass.\nThe EBA did not include any reference to almost $500,000 being paid to the AWU for a “paid education levy” over two to three years.\nMr Shorten conceded the paid education levy had been an “oral agreement” with ACI but had not been included in the EBA he was negotiating at the same time.\nMr Stoljar said Mr Shorten had a “serious conflict of interest” negotiating an EBA and a side deal with the same company.\nMr Shorten said it was not a conflict of interest because “we were negotiating very good conditions and the members and delegates and organisers were negotiating excellent conditions for glass workers at Spotswood.”\nHe said the AWU would have liked to have had the levy in the EBA but if the employer was not prepared to include it the issue was “not something you were prepared to stop the production lines for.”\nMr Shorten revealed in the hearing on Wednesday he had failed to declare a donation from a labour-hire company ahead of the 2007 federal election.\nThe $40,000 donation from Unibuilt was not declared until Monday this week.\nUnibuilt later donated money through the Australian Workers’ Union that was used to fund Mr Shorten’s campaign director Lance Wilson between February and November 2007.\nMr Wilson, known to Mr Shorten as a member of Young Labor, was however listed on the books of Unibuilt as a “research officer”.\nThe company was at the time negotiating an enterprise bargaining agreement with the AWU, of which Mr Shorten was national secretary.\nSenior Counsel Assisting the Commissioner Jeremy Stoljar SC during the royal commission into trade union governance and corruption in 2014. Picture: Paul Harris Source: News Corp Australia\nBut the Labor leader on Wednesday denied claims he used his position as national secretary of the AWU to his own advantage, as he sought to win the Victorian federal seat of Maribyrnong.\nMr Shorten rejected Mr Stoljar’s suggestions that he had only declared the donation because he was “waiting to see whether this would emerge in the royal commission”, despite knowing about it for months.\nOther MPs, including Prime Minister Tony Abbott, had updated their disclosures in recent years, Mr Shorten said.\nBOLT: ‘SORRY BILL, THIS ISN’T A GOOD LOOK’\nMASSIVE COLD FRONT SET TO FREEZE THE STATE\nSTATE OF ORIGIN 3 PLAYER RATINGS\nFormer Labor minister and union boss Greg Combet has been acting as an adviser with Mr Shorten’s legal team.\nFollowing Wednesday’s grilling, Mr Combet praised the federal Labor leader’s performance.\n“I think he’s been very upfront about it all,” Mr Combet told reporters in Sydney.\nBut not every ALP member was as supportive of Mr Shorten.\nFormer ALP national secretary Bob Hogg called for the Labor leader to quit in the wake of his royal commission appearance.\n“Bill, do something for the ALP. It is simple. Just go,” Mr Hogg wrote on social media on Wednesday night.\nThe hearing continues.\nThe November 2007 donation forms, signed by Bill Shorten.
