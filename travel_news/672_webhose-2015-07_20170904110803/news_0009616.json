Emirates offers daily flights between Athens and Dubai using Boeing Co 777-300ER aircraft, while Qatar Air deploys smaller planes but offers more frequencies on its Athens-Doha route, with three flights a day available from June 1. \n\"Greece is popular because of the traffic flows of the Greek diaspora,\" said Hubert Frach, Emirates's sales chief for the Americas, Europe, Africa and Russia. \"Links between Greece and emerging markets are growing as the economic downturn is forcing companies to look beyond traditional regions.\" \nThe location of the Gulf means eastbound flights to onward destinations such as Australia, home to the second-largest overseas Greek population, are favoured, though Emirates is also examining direct flights from Athens to North America, where connectivity is patchy outside the summer months. A combination of favourable ticket prices and close to 90% occupancy, 10 points higher than the Emirates average, makes Athens one of the carrier's top routes, Frach said. \nThe passenger tally on the service reached 224,000 in the year through March, swollen by double-daily services during some weeks last summer, Frach said. Carrying seafarers for Greece's shipping industry is also lucrative, the executive said in an interview. \nCapital controls in Greece last week that limit cash withdrawals and online bank transactions have thrown travel into disarray. Ryanair Holdings, the Irish low-cost carrier that serves 11 destinations in Greece, said it's letting customers buy tickets in cash for the time being. \nTravel via the Gulf allows for direct onward services to a host of Asia-Pacific destinations, making it preferable to flying via more traditional hubs in London, Paris and Frankfurt. \nExtra services enhance connections to forward flights, with passengers transiting through the Gulf to and from Greek population centres such as Sydney, Melbourne and South Africa. About 11mn people of Greek descent live beyond the Mediterranean, according to official government figures. \nAthens has flights to just six cities beyond Europe and the Middle East, according to its website. In Asia, only Beijing and Singapore have direct services, leaving the rest of the continent open to Qatar Airways, Emirates and Turkish Airlines, which is building a Gulf-style mega-hub in Istanbul. Qatar Airways will offer 19,000 seats to Greece next month, versus 13,000 at Emirates and 29,000 at Turkish Air. \nThe biggest Greek airline today is Aegean Airlines, a former regional carrier that expanded in the wake of the Olympic Airways collapse in 2009 and went on to absorb Olympic Air, a rump operation from the former flag carrier, in 2013. \nFollowing the success of Emirates's Athens services, the Greek government has asked the Mideast carrier to consider extending the flights to the US using so-called fifth freedom rights, Emirates President Tim Clark said last month. Its Dubai-Milan route already continues onwards from Italy. \nFrach said there are no immediate plans for Greece-US flights, while adding that Emirates will \"work closely\" with the Greek authorities to assess possible opportunities. \nOnly New York and Philadelphia are currently served direct from Athens, by Delta Air Lines and American Airlines Group respectively, with other locations requiring a stop in West European hubs. That's \"definitely not popular with the Greek diaspora in the US, or those US clients wanting to join cruise ships in Piraeus,\" Clark said. \nGreece - which lured 22mn visitors in 2014, twice its own population - also remains a \"powerful magnet for tourists,\" with Emirates seeing demand from China, the Indian subcontinent, Australia and the Middle East, Frach said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T06:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T13:21:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
