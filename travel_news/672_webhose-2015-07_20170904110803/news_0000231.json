The latest addition to Bizzabo's comprehensive event management platform gives event organizers the ability to boost ticket sales by turning ticket buyers into event promoters on social networks.. \nBizzabo’s ‘Ticket Boost’ incentivizes attendees to share events with their social networks by offering discounts on events to new referrals while rewarding the registered attendee - the referrer - for sharing. When an event attendee registers, they receive a dedicated, shareable, and unique discount code to share with their friends and colleagues. A registered attendee sharing the code receives money back for every successful referral, up to a full refund on their ticket. Event planners have complete control over the discount percentage or amount, and can choose to activate or deactivate the ticket boost feature at any time. The feature is seamlessly integrated into the event analytics dashboard so organizers can track the success of attendee shares, as well as the amount of revenue earned from Ticket Boost. This double-sided referral feature is an integral part of Bizzabo’s all-in-one event management software. Some well-known tech conferences, including The Lean Startup Conference and Grow Conference, have activated the Ticket Boost feature and have already seen increased revenue in a matter of days. “The dual-sided referral model has been wildly successful at fueling the growth of companies such as Uber, Dropbox and others”, says Bizzabo CMO and Co-founder, Alon Alroy. “Ticket Boost is an extremely exciting feature for our industry. It encourages word of mouth and event buzz and is fully aligned with how the best event marketers promote their events. Ticket Boost is unique compared to many traditional ticketing referral programs which only incentivizes the registered attendee to share or tweet representing a one-sided referral model. Bizzabo’s Ticket Boost model creates a win for ticket buyers, their friends, and event organizers.” The new referral system is the latest in online marketing tools and solutions Bizzabo has created. The company recently unveiled their event website builder, giving anyone planning an event the ability to create, design, and brand a dedicated event website in a matter of moments, also serving as a digital hub for ticket sales.
