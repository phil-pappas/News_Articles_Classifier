In a few weeks we’ll review one of their new travel shirts they’re branching into. \nThe company made their name with some innovative pants that I was impressed with the first time I saw them many years ago, as they were just getting into the marketplace. I loved everything about them except for one issue: they were heavy. Made out of thick canvas treated with Teflon, they were rugged and comfortable, but weighed as much as some pairs of shoes and were suited better for cold climates than hot ones. \nNow the P^Cubed Adventure Travel Pants are out in a new nylon fabric that’s much lighter, but is also rugged and solidly constructed. This “Nature-like Nylon” is also a much softer synthetic than you’ve probably felt against your skin too. It doesn’t feel slick and it doesn’t make the swishy sound many travel pants do when your legs rub together. \nNaturally these will dry faster, whether that’s after being caught in a downpour or after they need a sink washing from a week of heavy wear. They’ll also wick the sweat coming off your body if you’re not in the humid tropics. And they can sit in your stuffed carry-on for a flight over the ocean and not be wrinkled on the other end. \nThe best part is, you don’t give up anything choosing these over the original heavy cotton ones except for weight. The nylon ones even have a “diamond gusset crotch” to allow more free movement. You still get all the terrific features that enable you to leave the money belts, money pouches, and hidden zipper products at home. It’s next to impossible for a pickpocket to get in and steal your valuables when you’ve got these pants on unless you’re passed out and drooling on the sidewalk. \nEvery pocket has multiple layers of protection in the way of zippers (that go up, not down), pockets within pockets, and button flaps. See a video running down the various features no YouTube or under “features” on their website. \nIf you’re in an area you don’t have to worry, you can just zip or button a pocket and get at your money easily. If you’re in a notorious pickpocket area like Rome or Barcelona though, you can go into lockdown mode and be sure you won’t suffer the same fate as so many others around you suffer each day, with double or triple protection. \nThe new nylon Pickpocket Proof Adventure pants come in three colors and will cost you around $110, but they’ll probably hold up for at least the next 10 years of travel and as I’ve said before, they’re also like buying insurance for your valuables. With a pair of these on, you’re not going to lose your money, credit cards, phone, or ID. How much is that worth? \nYou can also get these in a convertible style in nylon too. Get them direct from the P^Cubed website or buy at Orvis or Travelsmith .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T12:37:03.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
