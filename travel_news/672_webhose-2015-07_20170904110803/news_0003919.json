Last minute enquiries about Spain family holidays through Responsible Travel’s website since the beginning of June have increased by 58% since last year, an increase the company ascribes to travellers’ desire for more authentic, experience-led holidays.\nIn June it was reported that Magaluf’s plans to introduce new laws and fines to control antisocial tourist behaviour had failed to make an impact in ‘cleaning up’ the resort’s image. And the new president of the Canary Islands, Fernando Clavijo, has suggested recently that tourist numbers should be capped and that the rising number of cheap, all-inclusive packages should be controlled in order to prevent what he calls the ‘Magaluf Effect’ – the pursuit of large numbers of tourists killing quality.\nJustin Francis, managing director of Responsible Travel comments, “There is clearly an increasing interest among travellers to escape the mass tourism of Spain’s more notorious holiday resorts and discover something more authentic, more responsible; in essence something more Spanish.\n“And with places such as Magaluf trying, and so far failing to crack down on the irresponsible behaviour of the tourists they attract, we are thrilled to see that alternative holiday experiences in Spain, which place real value on local culture and identity and which share the benefits of tourism with local people, are gaining in popularity.”\nResponsible Travel still has hundreds of last minute holidays left available worldwide, including many in Spain, and all screened for their commitment to responsible tourism, benefitting communities, culture and conservation. Including all types of travel from active adventures to accommodations, the 7 most-booked family holidays on the site, with last minute availability, are:\nSpanish course & walking holiday, Picos de Europa, Spain Activity holiday in Montenegro Catalonia self-guided family cycling holiday, Spain Cirali Beach villa holiday, Turkey Catalonia family mountain biking & activity holiday, Spain Family holiday in Thailand Family sea kayaking holiday in Croatia.\nSource: Responsible Travel\nTags: responsible travel , spain", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T22:17:04.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
