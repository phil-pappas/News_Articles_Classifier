All U.S. citizens are invited to attend and to bring along one Costa Rican guest for a truly binational celebration. To get into the spirit of the big day, The Tico Times spoke to Cait Bell, 45, a Committee member whose family has been involved the picnic since its inception.\nTT: What do the Committee and picnic tradition mean for your family?\nCB: For my family, it is a lifetime tradition. These are my roots. My father is one the pioneers – he’s always supported it – and I’ve participated in the Committee for 20 or 25 years. Since my children were born I’ve stayed at the edge, but I still taking part in it. I’ve spent some Fourth of July celebrations outside of Costa Rica and even in the United States, but it has never been celebrated as it is here in Costa Rica.\nTell us about something you remember from old picnics.\nWhat I remember about the old picnics, those held at the old U.S. Ambassador’s Residence, were the oxcart rides. I loved to eat cotton candy and popcorn and walk around waving little flags. The picnic was a highlight of [Costa Rica’s mid-year school vacations], and it is for my children, too. They are always looking forward to it.\nIs there something you miss from old picnics related to the actual picnics?\nThe traditional oxcarts are something we no longer do. We also used to have pie-eating contests. I remember the delicious blueberry pies. I never participated in the contest itself, but I really enjoyed watching it.\nOn the flip side, what are some advantages of today’s picnics compared to the older ones?\nNow the picnic takes place on the grounds of the Cervecería de Costa Rica, so we have much more space. We have a petting zoo, for example. My son loves to play volleyball and water balloon games, among others; for adults there is the beer garden, and car exhibitions. But the most significant activity, for all participants, is the flag raising by the U.S. Marines. We have so much fun and enjoy all the activities but without this one, the event wouldn’t be the same. Food-wise, nowadays there is TCBY! We didn’t have that back in the day. There are many companies that donate the food, such as bagels, coffee, ice cream, hot dogs, cotton candy, and popcorn.\nWe are always trying to include more and more activities, even though it is not always possible because of the budget. The Committee exists because of donations; people often think it is financed by the U.S. Embassy or the U.S. government, which is not true. So we have to look for donations or sponsorships, which is quite hard. The picnic is really important because it is the only event where most of the U.S. citizens here in Costa Rica get together. We would love to keep up this tradition forever, but it will depend on the support we can get.\nSee also: A look back at a different world – Remembering the Fourth of July Picnic, 1965\nThe 55th Annual American Colony Committee Fourth of July Picnic takes place on Saturday July 4 at the grounds of Cervecería de Costa Rica in Alajuela, from 9 am to 1 pm.
