Now it's the state capital of Himachal Pradesh. This wonderfully cool and charming town sprawls along a mountain ridge, enveloped in oak, pine and rhododendron forests. It's quite famous for its colonial style buildings and historic railway. The old Christ Church, with its beautiful stained glass windows, is one of Shimla's most prominent landmarks.Manali- Manali, with its soothing backdrop of the Himalayas, offers a blend of tranquility and adventure that makes it one of northern India's most popular destinations. You can do as little or as much as you want there. Located in the Kullu Valley, it's a magical place bordered by cool pine forest and the raging Beas River, which give it a special energy.Dharamsala and MacLeod Ganj - Nestled a short distance from each other in the Kangra Valley, the towns of Dharamsala and MacLeod Ganj are home to the exiled Tibetan Government. The Dalai Lama resides in Dharamsala, and many Tibetans have followed him there. You can expect to find a strong Tibetan influence in the area, with culture being the main attraction.Spiti- Rudyard Kipling described Spiti as a world within a world. This remote, high altitude area of Himachal Pradesh is tucked away against the border of Ladakh and Tibet.It's just been interested in outside vacationers since 1991, and still remains moderately unexplored. Part of this is due to Spiti being barren alpine desert that's covered in heavy snow for a high proportion of the year. Getting to Spiti involves a long drive, most popularly from Manali. The constantly evolving scenery is unforgettable and well worth the journey though.Dalhousie - Dalhousie and the Chamba Valley are lesser explored areas of Himachal Pradesh. If you're after striking, unspoiled views then Dalhousie is the place to find them. Spread over five hills, the town bares the distinct stamp of the British Raj. Its hotels are particularly reminiscent of that era. Kalatope Wildlife Sanctuary is located a short drive away from Dalhousie. It's possible to walk through the sanctuary but a permit is necessary for a vehicle. Those who dare to venture further into the Chamba Valley will discover fascinating ancient folklore, temples, and tribes. For more information visit the site http://enrichmytrip.com/ .
