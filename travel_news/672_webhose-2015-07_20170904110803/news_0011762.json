It’s good for your health, gets the kids away from TV and Xbox, and it’s an activity you can all take part in, from toddlers and teenagers to grandparents. Many children spend far more time indoors today than their parents did in their day. Getting out into the countryside allows children the freedom to run around and explore, away from traffic but in an environment where a responsible adult is never far away. A family walk can help you bond with children as there is something companionable about walking side by side. It is certainly more relaxed than demanding a surly teen comes out of their bedroom to “talk to you” for a change. But getting kids off the sofa and out walking isn’t always easy. So what can you do to ensure they get the most out of it, and look forward to a Sunday afternoon ramble as much as you do? Much will, of course, depend on your children’s age with shorter walks being more appropriate for younger children, which avoids returning home with an exhausted child. Nothing can ruin a walk more than constant whining about being hungry or thirsty For those with much younger children, Ordnance Survey maps can help you plan routes that are suitable for buggies and strollers. This can ensure that little legs can rest when needed. Whatever age your children are, make sure you take plenty of snacks and drinks with you. Nothing can ruin a walk for all involved more than constant whining about being hungry or thirsty. Taking a picnic or stopping at a place of interest or playground en route can also make the outing less about the walk and more about the planned activity. Try to get the kids interested in their surroundings. Older children love the opportunity to be put in charge of map reading. And you may find children are more adept at using the latest digital downloads from OS than older relatives. Keep your children engaged. Make a list of things you might find en route: this could be anything from a fox hole to a kissing gate. Or take a nature book and see who can tick off the most flowers, trees or birds. Old-fashioned games, such as I Spy, are always popular. You need to make sure everyone has the right gear, too. Any child who ends up walking in wet or uncomfortable shoes is unlikely to grow up to be a walking convert. If you want them to be suitably prepared in jackets, hats and fleeces, think about what they’d like. Buy something in a favourite colour, or in camouflage, or one with hidden pockets. Kids also love gadgets. Arm them with a cheap GPS, a compass, a camera, pair of binoculars - or even a torch for dusk-time rambles - and this can transform a walk in the country into an exciting expedition. • To find out more about the Ordnance Survey’s OS Maps service, visit os.co.uk/osmaps", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T19:45:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
