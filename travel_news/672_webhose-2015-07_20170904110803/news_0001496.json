The company is allowing the cancellation of its holidays up to July 9 and for bookings to be amended to other destinations up to October 31. \nAccording to analysts at Morgan Stanley, Tunisia represents around 3% of Cook’s summer volumes. \n“This is too early to quantify, but geopolitical events can cost operators tens of millions of pounds, only some of which is treated as an exceptional cost,” they said. \nMeanwhile Greece reportedly represents around 15% of Cook’s programme. \n“Operators see the current situation as a temporary issue, and more of an inconvenience to customers, with the potential for more discounts from hoteliers, which tour operators could pass on to stimulate demand,” Morgan Stanley said. \nCook itself has insisted that it remains “business as usual” in Greece.

Very sad.Anyone that thinks Greece is business as usual is living in fantasy land unless they change policy very quickly. Why would you put yourself through all the hassle. Unsuitable or offensive?

London recovered from 7/7 because people didn't stay away despite over 50 people being killed.As for Greece it's a beautiful place and in the old days we used to take cash - you just have to be more careful. Don't be put of by the negativity in the press about these destinations - do you really think things will get better if they are abandoned by us!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T21:23:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
