Organised by the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB), the light show offers viewers an audio-visual treat, utilising 3D mapping technology to project vivid images onto the façade of the Hong Kong Cultural Centre and the Clock Tower in Tsim Sha Tsui, while upbeat music sets the mood.\nThis year’s summer version, a new phase in the popular light show, is in sync with the HKTB’s “Hong Kong Summer Fun” promotion. With the theme “SHOP EAT PLAY”, the light extravaganza highlights Hong Kong’s appeal in shopping, dining and entertainment, with a kaleidoscope of cheerful visuals, including fruity summer drinks, ice pops and soft serves, sand castles, the underwater world, a fashion runway, a playground, and cute pandas playing lifeguards.\nThe Hong Kong Pulse 3D Light Show is staged four times every evening, each session running for about eight minutes. Later in the year, two more light shows will be organised to coincide with the HKTB’s Hong Kong WinterFest and Hong Kong Chinese New Year promotions, for an exciting addition to the city’s traditional festivities.\nSource:-HKTB\nRelated Posts San francisco travel achieves leed gold certification ITB Berlin: Cross-border cooperation on the Danube PATA Visitor Arrival Forecasts: Arrivals Well on Track with Forecasts French ATC strike causes misery to passengers National Restaurant Association Commends House Ways & Means Passage of Anti-Hunger Measure", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T01:30:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
