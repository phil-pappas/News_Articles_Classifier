This colourful, cartoonish style is synonymous with the property’s owner, the artist, Richard Woods and sets the tone for the rest of the house. 'My practice crosses the boundaries between art, architecture and design and my home is an extension of that, I suppose,’ he explains. Woods’ work often plays with interior motifs, from flooring and chintz wallpapers to brick walls. The four-storey property Woods shares with his wife Jess Spanyol, a children’s book author, and their three children, 14 year-old Milo and 10-year-old twins Lorcan and Augusta, was built on the site of a dilapidated garage on a tranquil street in Hackney, east London. The upper part of the larch clad facade is painted in one of Woods' bold patterns (LUKE WHITE) As well as the visual stimuli, the scent of timber pervades the internal spaces. This is hardly surprising when the floors are solid oak and the CLT plywood panels that the walls are constructed from have been left exposed. The stark decorative style acts as a backdrop to display Woods’ custom-made furniture and designs, including pieces from Wrongwoods, a collaborative collection he created alongside the product designer, Sebastian Wrong. This idiosyncratic home is also 'full of things I’ve collected over the years,’ he explains. 'Living with other people’s work alongside your own is interesting.’ Furniture by designers from Verner Panton to Jasper Morrison is featured and there are numerous artworks on display. 'Many of the pieces were gifts,’ says Woods. A vibrant print by Mark Titchner is a favourite, as is a Matt Collishaw lightbox works, created to celebrate the birth of the couple’s son Milo. Interiors: A Victorian terrace with industrial-chic style The dining table with its bright green Formica top was made by Woods (LUKE WHITE) The first floor is the nucleus of family life. To the front, the comfortable sitting room is filled with eclectic design pieces, carefully arranged around two leather sofas. At the back of the property, there is a spacious kitchen and dining space, illuminated by floor-to-ceiling windows with sliding doors leading out to a terrace garden, brightened by a carpet of artificial grass and an assortment of potted plants. On the second floor, the doors to the four bedrooms and bathroom are laid out in a square, painted in chalky shades of grey, blue and green, which contrast with a Wrongwoods sideboard in bright, autumnal hues, displayed next to two of Woods’ Low Slung chairs, created for a recent exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery. The Kitchen units are from Ikea and have been clad in a veneer to maintain the uniform wood effect throughout (LUKE WHITE) The ground floor houses a large, light studio and print workshop for Woods and his team while Spanyol has an office on the fourth floor. 'It’s nice not to have to travel to the studio. Practically, it means we can spend more time together as a family,’ says Woods. Interiors: A light filled contemporary barn conversion Building their own home was a long-held ambition for the couple, who met at a party 24 years ago. 'We wanted an entirely wooden home that was sustainable, with great insulation and solar power’. Finding the right plot to build on, however, was decidedly trickier. Eventually, a friend pointed them towards the Hackney site. Richard Woods with his wife Jess Spanyol, and their three children (LUKE WHITE) 'It took 18 months to come to an agreement with the owner and finally buy it,’ Woods explains. The family sold their home and moved to a rented flat in Clapton, East London and dRMM architects were appointed to design the property while planning permission was sought, which took just under two years. Metsä, a Munich-based company, manufactured the structure from engineered Cross Laminated Timber (CLT), a highly sustainable form of plywood. 'We went to Munich to see the pieces being cut out’, he recalls. Their home arrived in London on two lorries. 'It took just nine days to construct the initial structure and we moved in about 6 months later.’ The stairs up to the first floor feature Woods' woodgrain pattern in various bright colours (LUKE WHITE) Finally completed in 2014 and built entirely from timber and glass, the facade of the property is clad in larch and is just as eye-catching as the interior. The top floor is painted in Woods’ woodgrain visuals. 'We were relieved when it was finished, but I might change the colours one day,’ says Woods. 'We may build out to the back and up on the roof at some stage too. I see the house as something that is always evolving and changing. It is not meant to be a museum.’ Woods’ latest work, a public art piece entitled Love Story, is on display at the Southbank Centre until 6th October.
