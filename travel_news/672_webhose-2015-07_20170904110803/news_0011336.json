We distance ourselves from that communication which is misleading the public and has a potential to create confusion among SAA employees,” said SAA Spokesperson, Tlali Tlali. “The reality is, SAA has put an employment freeze in place as the airline is currently undergoing headcount rationalisation to bring the number of staff in its employ to sustainable levels in an effort to make the company financially sustainable,” added Tlali.\nSAA would like to urge members of the public to take caution, protect their personal details and cross check or verify information with the company before they decide to submit their applications. “The communication in question bears all the hallmarks of a scam and seems to be preying on unsuspecting youth.\nSAA advertises all recruitment vacancies, as well as recruitment campaigns for Youth Development Programmes, on our web- site: flysaa.pnet.co.za. When candidates apply for any vacancy via the flysaa.pnet portal they have to upload a copy of their CV, ID and qualifications. No registration or application fee is applicable nor requested when applying for any of our vacancies. In addition, it is also free of charge to register on flysaa.pnet.\nThe airline is collaborating with the external law enforcement agencies to trace the origins of the recruitment scam and those behind it. To those who have already submitted their personal information, SAA recommends that they report the matter to the local police without delay.\nSource:- South African Airways.\nRelated Posts Austrian Airlines Financial Results as at 30 September 2013: Positive result gives optimism for break-even in 2013 Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building South African Airways (SAA) has embarked upon a sustainable aviation fuel program South Africa leads sky-commerce with world first aircraft tracking and real-time payment innovation; SAA first airline to activate globally South African Airways welcomes scrapping of yellow fever vaccinations on some routes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T16:03:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
