Hertz reassures customers that existing bookings will be fully honored and that future bookings can be made directly at the Hertz, Thrifty and Firefly websites. \nMichel Taride, Group President of Hertz International, commented: \"We have enjoyed many years of a successful relationship with Ryanair, but unfortunately we were not able to reach agreement with the airline over a significant contractual dispute in spite of considerable effort. \n\"The majority of Ryanair passengers who need car hire from the Hertz brands in July and August are already booked and confirmed. Any customer who wishes to book car rental and enjoy great service at competitive rates can make arrangements directly with us. Customers can also modify existing bookings on the Ryanair website. \n\"Hertz deeply values all of its partnerships, some which have been going for more than 20 years. We strongly believe in mutually beneficial partnerships and would never take lightly the decision to end a key relationship. \n\"We are confident in our legal position and intend to pursue this matter vigorously through the courts.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T05:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T06:09:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
