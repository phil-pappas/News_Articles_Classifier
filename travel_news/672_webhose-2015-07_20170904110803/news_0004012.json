But kind of worse.\" \nThat was one of the most coherent things I overheard while climbing Big Daddy, a mountainous dune in the Sossusvlei area of Namibia's Namib Desert. \nAn American woman made the comment as she slumped over about a third of the way up the sand mountain. \nMost others just kind of grunted. \nBig Daddy's peak of about 325 metres towers over the surrounding red dunes at Sossusvlei. \nClimbers who make it to the top look out at the slightly less imposing Big Mama dune and over Deadvlei - an eerie salt pan dotted with blackened skeletons of camel thorn trees. \nDeadvlei clay pan in the Namib-Naukluft Park in Namibia.

Ad Feedback \nVicinity to the park is key, and with my base at Kulala Desert Lodge just a 10-minute drive from the park's entrance, I was looking up from the base of Big Daddy by 7.30am. \nA guide from the lodge gave me several pointers, the best of which was to step in other people's footprints. \nThe already partially compressed sand meant I sunk less and cut my stairmaster level in half. \nHe told me to stop and look round once in a while, rather than simply power up without appreciating the view. \nAnd he told me to listen to my heart. \nWhoa. I thought the emotion meter had skyrocketed to a whole other 1980s-pop-ballad measure, until he clarified that he'd had an older male guest with cardiac issues give Big Daddy a go a few weeks earlier. \nClimbers scale Big Daddy dune near Sossusvlei in Namib-Naukluft Park. Photo: Nathan Brown \nThat advice was quite literal. \nWhile the dune is always an uphill battle, the gradient is not constant. \nThere are a few fairly flat stretches, which seem to be nature's gift to help restore the flagging climber. \nThen there are also steeper segments - nature's way of flipping you the bird. \nThe guide said he'd seen people go up in 40 minutes, but most took about an hour and a half. \nI was smack in the middle of those times, and proud of my performance. \nThis isn't your Kilimanjaro or your Everest, but it's a decent hike and, for me, the sense of satisfaction at the top matched the views. \nBut the real bees knees? The two-minute descent. A slip 'n' slide never felt so good. \nMORE INFORMATION An Adventure World three-night package to Kulala Desert Lodge, including return flights from Windhoek Airport, all meals, local drinks, camp activities and park fees, is priced from $2250. \nThe writer travelled with assistance from Wilderness Safaris and Adventure World. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T03:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T01:29:25.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
