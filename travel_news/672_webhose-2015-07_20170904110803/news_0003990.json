The visitor still has to punch a button on the desk and type in information on a touch panel screen.\nFrom the front desk to the porter that is an automated trolley taking luggage to the room, this hotel in south-western Japan , aptly called Weird Hotel, is “manned” almost totally by robots to save labour costs.\nHideo Sawada, who runs the hotel as part of an amusement park, insists using robots is not a gimmick but a serious effort to use technology and achieve efficiency.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A receptionist robot greets a hotel employee, demonstrating how to check in at the new hotel, aptly called Weird Hotel, in Sasebo, south-western Japan. Photograph: Shizuo Kambayashi/AP Henn na Hotel, as it is called in Japanese, was shown to reporters on Wednesday, complete with robot demonstrations, before it opened on Friday.\nAnother feature is facial recognition technology, so instead of the standard electronic keys, a digital image of the guest’s face is registered during check-in.\nThe reason? Robots aren’t good at finding keys if people happen to lose them.\nA giant robotic arm, usually seen in manufacturing, sits in glass quarters in the lobby. It lifts one of the boxes stacked into the wall and puts it through a space in the glass, where a guest can place an item in it, to use as a locker.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A cloak robot moves a box loaded with items received from a guest during a demonstration for the media at the Henn na Hotel or Weird Hotel, in Sasebo. Photograph: Shizuo Kambayashi/AP The arm will put the box back into the wall until the guest wants it again. The system is called “robot cloak room”.\nWhy a simple coin locker won’t do is not the point.\n“I wanted to highlight innovation,” Sawada said. “I also wanted to do something about hotel prices going up.”\nStaying at Henn na Hotel starts at 9,000 yen ($80), a bargain for Japan, where a stay in one of the nicer hotels can easily cost twice or three times that much.\nThe concierge is a doll-like hairless robot with voice recognition that prattles breakfast and event information. It cannot call a cab or do other errands.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A porter robot, left, escorts a hotel employee while carrying his suitcase. Photograph: Shizuo Kambayashi/AP Japan is a world leader in robotics technology, and the government is trumpeting robotics as a pillar of its growth strategy.\nRobots have long been used in manufacturing but interest is also high in exploring the potential of robots in human interaction, including helping care for the elderly.\nRobotics is also key in decommissioning the three reactors in Fukushima, northern Japan, which went into meltdowns in 2011, in the worst nuclear catastrophe since Chernobyl.\nOne area on which Henn na Hotel still relies on humans is security. It is dotted with security cameras, and real people watch everything through a monitor to ensure guests are safe and no one makes off with an expensive robot.\n“And they still can’t make beds,” said Sawada, who has also engineered the rise of a popular affordable Japanese travel agency.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hideo Sawada in one of the hotel’s rooms. Photograph: Shizuo Kambayashi/AP He has big ambitions for his robot hotel concept and wants to open another soon in Japan and, later, abroad. He is also keen to add other languages, such as Chinese and Korean, to the robots’ vocabulary.\nA block-shaped robot that was scuttling around in the lobby had been brought in to do room service, delivering beverages and simple snacks. But it wasn’t ready to do that yet.\nOutside, Sawada demonstrated a drone that flew in to deliver a few small jars filled with snacks. He wanted to eventually have drones perform in shows for guests.\nIn the rooms, a lamp-size robot in the shape of a fat pink tulip called Tuly answers simple questions such as, “What time is it?” and “What is the weather tomorrow?” You can also tell it to turn the room lights on or off. There are no switches on the walls.\nSawada is keeping the hotel half-filled for the first few weeks to make sure nothing goes wrong.\nHe also cancelled at the last minute the overnight stay planned for media. The robots simply weren’t ready.", "external_links": ["http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Japan%27s+robot+hotel%3A+a+dinosaur+at+reception%2C+a+machine+for+room+service&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2015%2Fjul%2F16%2Fjapans-robot-hotel-a-dinosaur-at-reception-a-machine-for-room-service&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F41cd5b98c337fdc3237060e8284140e7b6d521a2%2F0_191_4500_2699%2F4500.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Japan%27s+robot+hotel%3A+a+dinosaur+at+reception%2C+a+machine+for+room+service&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4aydk%2Fstw%23img-5", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Japan%27s+robot+hotel%3A+a+dinosaur+at+reception%2C+a+machine+for+room+service&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4aydk%2Fstw%23img-4", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Japan%27s+robot+hotel%3A+a+dinosaur+at+reception%2C+a+machine+for+room+service&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2015%2Fjul%2F16%2Fjapans-robot-hotel-a-dinosaur-at-reception-a-machine-for-room-service&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2Fee4ceb00a0f6a1c28ed00825bf22e3b2f714a9ec%2F0_75_4500_2699%2F4500.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Japan%27s+robot+hotel%3A+a+dinosaur+at+reception%2C+a+machine+for+room+service&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4aydk%2Fstw%23img-3", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4aydk%2Fsfb%23img-3&ref=responsive", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4aydk%2Fsfb%23img-2&ref=responsive", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Japan%27s+robot+hotel%3A+a+dinosaur+at+reception%2C+a+machine+for+room+service&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2015%2Fjul%2F16%2Fjapans-robot-hotel-a-dinosaur-at-reception-a-machine-for-room-service&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F73828639e206f19fb185a7903ff16e5b39921ca6%2F0_0_4500_2863%2F4500.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4aydk%2Fsfb%23img-5&ref=responsive", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Japan%27s+robot+hotel%3A+a+dinosaur+at+reception%2C+a+machine+for+room+service&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4aydk%2Fstw%23img-2", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4aydk%2Fsfb%23img-4&ref=responsive", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Japan%27s+robot+hotel%3A+a+dinosaur+at+reception%2C+a+machine+for+room+service&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2015%2Fjul%2F16%2Fjapans-robot-hotel-a-dinosaur-at-reception-a-machine-for-room-service&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2Ffe4a7e519b4bcbb4be86c94a532808cfa9f172f8%2F0_302_5760_3457%2F5760.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-16T11:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T06:30:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
