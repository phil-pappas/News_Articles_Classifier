This relationship has progressed to the current age, where having pets in our homes is very common, and pet care has become a billion-dollar industry along with animal mover specialists who ensure that pets travel in aircraft comfortably. Animal Mover Specialists In the US, domestic transportation of pets is quite common but requires pets travel permits and health docs, like updated health certificates. Most airlines do have provisions for carrying pets on board; this is usually in the cargo compartment, which is pressurized and air-conditioned. Getting all this documentation needed for domestic transport is time-consuming, which is where using the services of a professional animal shipping company is important. These professionals have been arranging these services in the United States of America for over 30 to 40 years, and have all the answers to their client's questions about the safety of their pets when traveling. Latest Rules & Regulations Some of the animal moving companies have specialist animal movers who are assigned to individual clients to help with shipping cats and dogs across the country to their new destination. They have a good relationship with the airlines, especially those that allow pets to be transported, and are familiar with all the rules and regulations that apply to the United States of America and other countries worldwide. Their expertise is keeping in touch with all the latest pets travel permits and health docs domestically and internationally as well as the travel conditions of different airlines. This is very important, because transporting a pet domestically or internationally counts, because it is an important member of the family. Proper Qualifications Animal mover specialists with years of experience shipping cats and dogs across the country behind them know which airlines and shortest flights to look for, to ensure that the pets do not suffer undue anxiety or trauma enroute; they can inform clients of direct flights and the shortest possible routes. If the pet is traveling alone, they will arrange for the pickup from home and deliver it to the airport as well as arrange for it to be met at the destination airport and transport it home. They also have provisions to arrange animal air travel crates for the flight. Owners of pets should make the proper research before handing over their pets to the animal movers; they should be members of the International Pet and Animal Transportation Association and for travel in the United States of America, they should also have appropriate USDA documentation and pets travel permits and health docs which covers animal transportation.
