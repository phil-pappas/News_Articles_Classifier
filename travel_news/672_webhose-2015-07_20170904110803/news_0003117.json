If you’ve got a ripped up old leather jacket or bag, follow these instructions and smarten up your suitcases.\nYou will need:\nScissors\nUpcycled leather (for the tag and the strap)\nPermanent markers (and a steady hand)\nPencil\nRuler\n1 . I recommend using upholstery weight leather. For small projects like this, you can use an old leather jacket.\n2 With your pencil draw out a tag the shape and size of your choice and cut out with scissors.\n3 . Try using a permanent marker to write a phrase or your initials on the front of the tag. On the reverse side write whatever contact details you wish to add.\n4 . Cut out a thin strip of leather twice the height of the tag and tie a knot at the end.\n5 . Cut a slit near the top of the tag and pull the loop through. Attach to your luggage.\nnancystraughan.blogspot.co.uk", "external_links": ["http://nancystraughan.blogspot.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-07-10T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T20:21:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
