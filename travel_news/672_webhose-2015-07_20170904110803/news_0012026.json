Europe plays a key role in the worldwide air cargo supply chain. While the contribution of the air cargo sector to the European economy is generally understood, often the reality it faces is not. AEA’s member airlines are facing regulatory burdens, lack the necessary airport infrastructure and are confronted with administrative inefficiencies which have an immediate impact on Europe’s competitiveness at global level. All these issues were highlighted in a constructive meeting with MEPs and representatives of the European Commission. \n\n\n“European regulators often seem to forget about the importance of the air freight industry, and focus only on the passenger side of our business”, said Mr. Athar Husain Khan, AEA’s CEO. “The Aviation Package discussion provides a unique opportunity to address the many challenges faced by the cargo divisions of European airlines in this fast changing and globalizing cargo market environment.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T09:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T09:32:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
