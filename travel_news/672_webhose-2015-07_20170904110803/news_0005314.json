For starters, the luxury resort is 789 feet tall — the tallest building south of Atlanta.\nThe 221-room hotel, including 39 suites, occupies 22 of the building’s 70 floors. Views of Biscayne Bay, the causeway and city are magnificent. Spend a night here and your head won’t be the only part of you in the clouds.\nBotero bronzes of Adam and Eve can be found on the first floor at The Four Seasons. A third Botero nude commands attention in the hotel lobby on the seventh floor. Contributed A big (2-acre) terrace on the seventh floor sports two pools, private cabanas and hammocks stretched over the water. You don’t feel like you’re seven stories high on the terrace, a tropical oasis amid the bustling Miami scene. Big stars, like Beyonce and Jay Z, have been known to hang out here.\nArt is a big deal here, too. The Four Seasons has a $3.5 million collection that showcases the works of more than 35 artists, many of whom are of Latin American origin. Anchoring the collection are three gigantic sculptures by Colombian artist Fernando Botero. I like to stand next to them. Makes me feel petite.\nFor more art, guests can drive a short distance to the Wynwood Art District, known for its cutting-edge art. Guided tours ( www.wynwoodartwalk.com ) are offered on the second Saturday of the month.\nWant to sleep in the tallest building in the state? Try the 70-story Four Seasons Miami. Contributed I also enjoy browsing through shops in the nearby Miami Design District ( www.miamidesigndistrict.net ), a once shabby area transformed into a lively center for shopping, cultural and dining experiences. My husband and I have brought home so many treasures (Oriental rungs, Moroccan lamps, Italian dinnerware, etc.) from these shops over the years.\nBack at The Four Seasons, the Edge restaurant is definitely worth checking out. It’s a modern steakhouse known for great steaks, seafood, locally sourced fruits and vegetables, a scrumptious Sunday brunch and a terrace perfect for evening cocktails around a fire pit.\nService at this skyscraper is first rate and, for me, that is a big deal, too. And a reason to return.\nA view of the seventh floor terrace with two pools, private cabanas and hammocks stretched over the water. Contributed Guest rooms have spectacular views of Biscayne Bay. Contributed\nIF YOU GO\nFour Seasons Hotel Miami\nWhere: 1435 Brickell Ave., Miami\nWhat: 221 rooms including 39 suites. Spa, fitness center, children’s programs. The hotel’s 2-acre, seventh-floor terrace has lush landscaping, 11 cabanas, two swimming pools, a wading pool and a children’s pool. Also on the seventh floor, Edge, a gourmet restaurant, bar and outdoor bar and lounge.\nRates: Standard summer rates begin at $259 a night, much less than during the winter season. Ask about specials including one that includes a third night free.\nInfo: 305- 358-3535, www.fourseasons.com/miami .\n</p", "external_links": ["http://www.fourseasons.com/miami", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/07/07/57/53/Pool-Terrace-Four-Seasons-Miami.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/07/07/38/b3/Four-Seasons-Hotel-Miami-Boteros.jpg", "http://www.wynwoodartwalk.com/", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/07/07/4a/93/Premiere-Bay-View-Room.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/07/07/00/0c/Four-Seasons-Hotel-Miami.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-10T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T22:12:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
