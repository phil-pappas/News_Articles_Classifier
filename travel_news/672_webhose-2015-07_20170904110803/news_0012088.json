In parts of London where heavy traffic meets pedestrians, we used to put up metal barriers along the kerb. Cars would thunder down these cattle-pens from one red light to another and it wasn’t very civil. With shared space, the idea is to tear down barriers, open up the road and let human decency do the job. By the Coca-Cola London Eye these days, the tourists, diners and theatregoers mill around on the pavements, crossing the road when the mood takes them. Drivers know this, so they move slowly and considerately. You see that little British nod-and-wave between driver and pedestrian, one of our country’s quiet virtues, long thought vanished from the capital. Since I’ve been driving a Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV (plug-in hybrid electric vehicle) in London, the biggest pleasure has been the calm. It’s a physiological thing. In my old petrol car, letting someone cross would mean a strain of engine-braking, a judder at idle and a strain as I accelerated. It’s only now I’ve spent some time in a car that glides that I realise the constant strain and judder, transmitted up my spine, had been making me subliminally ratty. I don’t want to come over all new-age, but I believe the boom in electric cars is making London a calmer place. Because the Outlander PHEV glides, I’ve been more alert. I can hear ambulances from twice as far and pedestrians talking as they walk alongside me. Of course, it cuts both ways. While at a zebra crossing I was singing to Bon Jovi with great verve when I noticed the people crossing could hear me. Town and country The Outlander PHEV is not purely a city car. Its two electric motors let it work in four-wheel-drive mode and its high clearance equips it for muddy fields. In the time I’ve had it, I’ve made trips to North Wales, Buckinghamshire and Gloucestershire. I simply charge up and set off. On the motorway I switch to petrol and the two-litre engine smoothly takes over – then I switch back to urban mode when I hit town. A more intelligent man would plan ahead and find charge points at the other end – there are 8,500 in the UK – but I’ve been lazy. Without a charge, it gets about as many miles to the gallon as a standard SUV on petrol. But it can achieve more when you make the most of the electric range – and that’s where it gets interesting. This plug-in hybrid can charge from a normal three-pin plug at home, a four-pin DC plug at a roadside rapid charger or a Type 1 fast charger (for an 80 per cent charge in half an hour). It also regenerates charge when braking or coasting down a hill. The first time I saw my charge indicator magically go up instead of down, I felt a surprising thrill. It was like getting a power-up in a computer game. I became obsessed with topping up the charge on the go. I started to play the game properly and switched to “Save” mode on motorways – which means you don’t use electricity, just petrol power and end up with more charge than you started with. Feel the benefits More little victories make the Outlander PHEV a sensible city car. First there’s the £5,000 government grant, which makes this version the same price as the diesel Outlander. There’s no annual road tax and there’s the bonus of being able to recharge at home if you’re able to. But for me, as a Londoner, the best “cheat” is exemption from the £11.50-a-day Congestion Charge. Actually, there’s one better. London’s not overstocked with parking spaces, but now has 1,300 public charging points reserved for electric vehicles. You pay £5 for a Source London card, and you can park and charge your car for free; and, even if you don’t want to charge, you can park for free in some boroughs like Westminster in their non-resident parking bays. My time with the Outlander PHEV in London felt like being part of a privileged elite. I know it’s all to the good, promoting clean air and less reliance on fossil fuels, but if it goes on like this, everyone’s going to want one.
