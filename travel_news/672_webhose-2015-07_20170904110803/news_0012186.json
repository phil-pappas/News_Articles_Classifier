It took four years to build.\nThe section between Urumqi in north Xinjiang and Aksu opened in 2011. The expressway will also serve as an important artery connecting China with Central and West Asia.\nXinjiang accounts for one sixth of the total area of China, but it only had 843 km of expressway the end of 2010, far below the national average.\nThis figure has surged to more than 4,000 km. Hotan is the only prefecture in the autonomous region not linked to highway.\nRelated Posts U.S. Tourism Misses Golden Opportunity with Chinese Visitors China’s railways record 231 million holiday trips Chelsea Football Club Hosts Leaders Sport Summit 2013, the world’s most Prestigious Sport Business Summit Lisa Lewis Joins Associated Luxury Hotels As National Sales Manager In The U.S. West Region CIBTM Delivers Insights Into China MICE Buyers’ Behaviour", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T01:23:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
