PUBLISHED: 14:40, Sun, Jul 12, 2015 | UPDATED: 15:21, Sun, Jul 12, 2015 GETTY Falmouth this summer’s hottest coastal spot \nAlmost literally, given its design. \nWith a huge, sail-like structure stretched over the entrance and a reception area built to look like a section of some sleek, ocean-going vessel, you half expect to be piped aboard. \nThe trendy design is entirely fi tting in Falmouth, a town rapidly becoming the new “it” place to visit in Cornwall. \nI came down on a two-day break with my wife Jane and son Oliver and was soon impressed by the buzz along Gyllyngvase Beach, a surfing hot spot. \nWith the achingly cool Gylly Café at its entrance – a bar/restaurant that could have been transported direct from Chelsea’s King’s Road – it is a long, sandy bay that reminded us more mature souls of every Beach Boys song we had ever heard. \nThe beach sits just at the bottom of the St Michael’s gardens, making the hotel a perfect base from which to soak up the local atmosphere. \nBut before we went off exploring, there was plenty at the hotel to occupy us. \nOur family room was a great place to sit, relax and take a few design notes. \nHere the maritime design becomes a little more Hollywood, the spacious, airy and beautifully finished pale-blue interior set off with the sort of expensivelooking wooden blinds film moguls have in their on-set apartments. VISIT CORNWALL Falmouth is a dream destination \nIt is the sort of room, complete with massive, walk-in wardrobe, that makes you want to dress up for dinner. \nI’m glad we did, too, because the super-stylish dining room, situated high above the gardens, has stunning views across to the sea and is a place that you want to linger in. \nThe food – including a mouth-watering hake “catch of the day” which my wife selected, and the perfectly-prepared Moroccan chicken my ever-hungry son tucked into – was superb. \nI plumped for a delicious rib-eye steak and all the trimmings. \nFollowing a lie-in the next morning my wife treated herself to an indulgent ESPA Aromatherapy massage (£59 for 60 minutes) in the hotel spa. \nAfter a relaxing rest on the sea-facing sun deck, a swim, steam and a dip in a Jacuzzi duly followed. \nShe emerged from the experience chilled and refreshed just ready for our next adventure: a good look at the shops in Falmouth plus a short ferry trip across to the beautiful town of St Mawes on the Roseland Peninsula. \nThe shops in Falmouth are a fascinating selection of small, designer stores selling chi-chi seaside clothing - everyone in Falmouth seems to wear sailor stripes – plus places that seem to have disappeared from most high streets. \nThere’s a secondhand bookshop, Bookmark, on Arwenack Street, which specialises in nautical books but also had piles of vintage Sixties paperbacks with garishly saucy covers. \nAlso a proper vinyl record shop (all classic vinyl at £10, with 20 per cent off when we visited), and of course, small cafés of every variety. VISIT CORNWALL Lighthouse overseeing the sea \nWe paid £28 for our three return tickets to St Mawes and headed down the steps to the waiting Duchess Of Cornwall ferry, as cool and beautifully fitted as everything in Falmouth seems to be. \nCamilla would have been very proud. \nSt Mawes has become a hot spot for affluent second homeowners. \nIt wasn’t difficult to see why as we puttered across the bay and the sleek, white villas with their perfect paling fences came into sight high above the rock pool and sand beaches. \nAs the ferry docked, a fair few of the passengers (including us) headed straight for the estate agent conveniently positioned opposite the little port to check out prices and fantasise. \nWe turned left and walked up the hill past a series of arty little shops. \nIn one of them I bought my wife a beautiful blue and white shell/pearl necklace, those colours seemingly to be de rigueur in this part of Cornwall. \nAs we climbed farther up the hill, heading for St Mawes Castle – one of Henry VIII’s coastal fortresses – a vintage, open-topped Rolls-Royce decked in wedding ribbons seemed the perfect foil for the immaculate seaside homes we were passing. \nIt had come from a wedding at the castle which had closed the place for the day. \nNever mind: we settled down on one of the many wooden benches and enjoyed the stunning views across to St Anthony’s Lighthouse. ENGLISH HERITAGE St Mawes Castle in Cornwall \nHeading back down, and feeling peckish, we took a left turn into the Tresanton Hotel for drinks and a light lunch. \nOwned by Olga Polizzi, mother of Alex Polizzi, TV’s Hotel Inspector, it has a wonderful restaurant deck on which to soak up the sun and sip fruit cocktails. \nAnxious to catch the ferry back we skipped dessert and bought a Cornish ice-cream (of course) from a van at the quayside. \nWe had been blessed with beautiful weather the next day, so my wife treated me to delicious fish and chips at Gylly Café, then we took a gentle walk along the seafront and up a wooded slope to Pendennis Castle, another, much larger Henry VIII fortress. Related articles The cream of Cornish hotels: The Headland is a clear winner \nThe castle bears Henry’s coat-of-arms over the portcullised entrance and there are giddying climbs, via very steep and narrow steps, to the roof to admire 360 degree views across all the surrounding countryside. \nThe fort, its scattered emplacements and earthworks still dotted with a mixture of cannons and more modern, fearsome-looking guns (all of which still work), was pressed into service as a coastal defence in the Second World War. \nA lady guide in military uniform – looking a bit like Honeysuckle Weeks from Foyle’s War – provided an excellent commentary for our little group, relishing (as we did) the dangers of handling cordite ammunition during an air-raid blackout (it is nasty, toxic stuff). \nLater she lamented that she wasn’t allowed to fire a huge “experimental” gun, its massive barrel pointed out to sea. \n“Just the sound of it breaks all the windows in the coastguard HQ,” she said, indicating a building just below the emplacement. \nShame. \nThe fort is so strategically important that it is available to be commandeered by the MoD at 48 hours’ notice. \nCrikey. \nWe pondered this over a cup of tea and some cake in the gift shop before heading down the hill to St Michael’s to prepare for a last farewell to Falmouth. \nGetting there: St Michael’s Hotel and Spa (01326 312707/stmichaelshotel.co.uk) offers doubles from £90 per night, B&B.
