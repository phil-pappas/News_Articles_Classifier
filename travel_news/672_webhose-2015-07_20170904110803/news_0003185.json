The feedback from operating crews has been very positive.\"\nBack at Cathay City, the airline's bustling headquarters adjacent to Hong Kong Airport, a state-of-the-art Airbus A350 flight simulator has been installed at the CX Flight Training Centre.\nThis was no easy feat, with the bulky simulator cockpit hoisted by crane into the facility via a gaping hole crated in the building's wall.\nThe job required equal parts machine and muscle.\nThe sim will be loaded with super-realistic maps fired from 4K 'Ultra HD' projectors, which Manager Simulator Engineering Neil Cothran says will produce \"fantastic images.\"\n\"Also, the cockpit is huge. Combined with some of the design features of the simulator structure, everyone will notice how large it is inside.\"\nOnce the sim is fully tested, certified and signed off in September, instructors, engineers and pilots will begin training in earnest.\nBut it won't be the first make-believe A350 ride for some Cathay Pacific crew who took part in the first Airbus A350 'virtual passenger flight' some two years ago.\nThe four-hour dry run in an A350 mock-up dubbed 'Cabin Zero' – on an imaginary journey from the Canary Islands to Hamburg, Germany – included a hearty hot lunch, mood lighting and realistic flight sounds (courtesy of Microsoft Flight Simulator software).\nRead: Airbus A350 makes its first 'virtual flight'\n David Flynn David Flynn is the editor of Australian Business Traveller and a bit of a travel tragic with a weakness for good coffee, shopping and lychee martinis.\nFollow @ausbt on\nEmail: @djsflynn\nShare this story Airline News Airport News Hotel News Lounge News Frequent Flyer News Reward Program News Tech News Travel Gear News Other News Search News Latest News Latest Have 1 report reply 1 3 hours, 43 minutes ago by petrhsr Looking forward to the A350, the new F, and glad to hear that there will be no... Ugh... Inflight bar.\n0 report reply 1 1 hour, 19 minutes ago by mitchimus I enjoyed the inflight bar on the Qatar A380, met a few really interesting folk and helped pass the time rather than sitting in suspended animation in my seat. It's a good compromise between those who want to live in a cocoon and those who want to have a place to get away from it. Allows airlines to cater to those who want isolation and those who don't..best of both worlds. The FA in the Qatar lounge told me it was usually full on the London - Doha afternoon flights.\n5 report reply 2 3 hours, 33 minutes ago by jubbing Looks fascinating, curious to see their routes as well.\n-1 report reply 3 2 hours, 41 minutes ago by TomGoddardd Really looking forward to see what city they'll fly the beauty to first, hopefully SYD :)\n2 report reply 4 1 hour, 20 minutes ago by S But what about Perth!?!?! ;)\n0 report reply 5 1 hour, 11 minutes ago by Nicholas Anyone know which routes the a350 will work on?\n0 report reply 1 7 minutes ago by Bizflyer Well off the top of my head I would be able to give a few\nPerth Auckland Duseldorf Manchester Boston Only reason for this is because it would provide a smaller load factor than the 300er but larger than a 787-9 (yes CX didnt order them I know)\nIt might also alow for a daily Manchester service", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/AusBT", "http://twitter.com/#!/djsflynn", "http://twitter.com/#!/ausbt"], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T10:43:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
