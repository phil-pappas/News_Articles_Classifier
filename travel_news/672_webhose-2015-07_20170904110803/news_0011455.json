Fiction this may be but, for the visitor, DC truly packs a punch when it comes to iconic landmarks, grand buildings, free museums and pretty neighbourhoods. Then there’s the city’s funky cutting-edge eateries, cocktail bars and traditional jazz bars. So with all this, who needs politics?\nVISITING AMERICA: 41 ways to enjoy Disneyland\nTHE BIG APPLE: Why it’s better to walk around New York\nNASHVILLE-BOUND: Six ways to try classic Southern meals\nWHERE TO STAY\nAn Obama-stride away from the White House, on Lafayette Square, the Sofitel provides a luxurious stay. The chic rooms feature Modigliani prints, leather chairs and custom carpets. The stylish ground-floor bar and outdoor terrace is the place to eavesdrop State Department gossip over a house cocktail.\nLuxury location .. the street entrance to the Sofitel Hotel in Washington DC. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nElsewhere, in trendy Dupont Circle, is Embassy Row Hotel — an excellent mid-range spot that alludes to its very location, on DC’s foreign embassy strip. The hotel’s revamp added a slightly whimsical, Alice-in-Wonderland touch with lots of black and turquoise flourishes. A lively foyer bar, restaurant and beautiful pool terrace mean fun and company (perfect for single travellers). Good on the hip pocket and perfect for families is Embassy Suites at the Chevy Chase Pavilion. It’s in Friendship Heights, seven metro stops from the CBD. These small and comfortable modern apartments have kitchenettes, so you can prepare meals if required; the gourmet Wholefoods supermarket is nearby.\nInsider knowledge: This American summer (June-July) will see the opening of the luxury Watergate Hotel (thewatergatehotel.com), after a $125 million renovation of the infamous site. Get ready to tap into your inner President Richard M. Nixon a la 1970s.\nPlush and trendy ... Embassy Row Hotel, Washington DC. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nWHERE TO EAT\nIn the past, the word “appetite” in DC meant quest for political power, while “gourmet” was a shrimp canape at a fundraising cocktail function. Thankfully, things have changed; the city’s cuisine scene is exploding. Night life-driven 14th Street sees a weekly restaurant or bar opening and will appeal to all tastes, though the top spot here is Spanish tapas joint Estadio . Whatever you do, start your day with a power breakfast at Blue Duck Tavern , on the ground floor of the Hyatt. The farm-to-table offerings include fabulous egg specialities. Don’t miss the eggs benedict with smoked trout or the pumpkin pancake (or the large selection of daily US newspapers). Fellow diners are an eclectic mix of business people, international visitors and hipsters, all after a great-value experience.\nEnjoy Spanish tapas ... Estadio restaurant in Washington DC. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nTime for lunch? Surprisingly, given it’s a visitors’ magnet, The Mall has a dearth of eateries. Exceptions include Red Apron Butchery , a funky “whole animal” butchery-cum-deli-cum-restaurant and bar. For $10, you can buy a fabulous pastrami and cabbage on pumpernickel sandwich, among other delicious bites, all packaged up picnic style so you can enjoy lunch on the go. By night it turns into a higher-end steakhouse and bar. For some real genuine local flavours, Mitsitam , the cafeteria of the American Indian Museum, serves up tasty indigenous cuisines of the Americas. Beyond the Mall, in nearby Dupont Circle, try Iron Gate . DC’s longest continually opened restaurant premises, this atmospheric spot is a converted carriage house. The bar is great for single travellers (there’s even a cocktail strangely, if slightly suggestively, named “How to fight loneliness”). For dinner, top choices include Rasika , one of DC’s most revered Indian spots and great for vegetarians, and Daikaya , a fabulously funky woody upstairs izakaya (Japanese tavern) dedicated to Japanese share plates. Book well in advance; alternatively, you can wait in a queue to enter the restaurant’s downstairs ramen bar. For a true off-the-beaten-track experience head to The Red Hen in Bloomingdale, DC’s cool cat district. The word is out about this convivial, open-plan restaurant, its “modern rustic” Italian cuisine and fabulous wine list. Don’t go past the rigatoni with fennel sausage ragu and, for dessert, the maple custard dessert.\nInsider knowledge : Never judge a DC restaurant by its modern blockish cover. Given the city’s tight and expensive real estate, many of the finest eateries are housed in modern office-style buildings, the likes of which you might walk past without a glimpse.\nPopular with diners ...

Mockingbird Hill is an uber-cool drinking spot that devotes itself to a traditional favourite, sherry.\nFor local brews, or more than 500 of them, head to Churchkey , a dark, hip drinking spot in a handy location on 14th Street.\nElsewhere Blue Jacket in DC’s Navy Yard near the baseball stadium, is the pre and post-game home base for the Washington Nationals fans.\nThis converted industrial building has cleverly incorporated its brewery (tours available) and pours a variety of brews and old craft beers.\nInsider knowledge: Let’s not artificially sweeten this: Coffee is not DC’s strong point.\nThankfully, however, a few newer cafes deliver the java touch. Coffee snobs should head to The Wydown on 14th Street, or to nearby 12th Street to TCB (short for The Coffee Bar) , a cosy neighbourhood cafe full of students with coffee in one hand and a keyboard in another. Elsewhere, get your hit at Baked + Wired in Georgetown, or Filter in Dupont Circle and Foggy Bottom (yes, cue to giggle).\nGet your caffeine fix ... The Wydown Coffee Bar in D.C.

See whitehouse.gov ).\nThe Mall, a 5km strip of scrubby grass, is hugely symbolic for locals, being the site of many celebrations, including July 4 fireworks and presidential inaugurations. The Capitol is at one end, a massive statue of President Lincoln at the other, and the Washington Monument in the middle.\nStatue of Abraham Lincoln.

Picture: iStock Source: Supplied\nIt’s also home to important memorials and many of the 19 extraordinary Smithsonian Institution museums (incredibly, entry to all these is free). Smithsonian highlights include the fabulous National Archives , home to mind-boggling documents — the original 1297 Magna Carta, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\nWhatever you do, to rub shoulders with the current (and ghosts of) American powerbrokers under the magnificent rotunda in DC’s powerhouse, visit The Capitol , the lawmaking centre of the American Congress (Congressmen and women do pass through discretely).\nInside the Library of Congress. Picture: Alamy Source: Supplied\nTranquil city ... the Potomac River in Georgetown, Washington, DC. Picture: Alamy Source: Supplied\nThen, head along the underground tunnel to The Library of Congress , whose stunning interiors are covered in rich mosaics. It holds one of the world’s largest archived book collections (more than 36 million books) and exhibits maps and manuscripts.\nSights beyond The Mall include the Phillips Collection , an acclaimed modern art museum in pretty Dupont Circle, a couple of stops on the metro from the Penn Quarter, the CBD and the pretty, historic neighbourhood of Georgetown.\nAs for after-hours fun? Jazz lovers and night owls should not miss the famous club Twins Jazz .\nPlus, be sure to catch a show at the impressive Kennedy Center .\nInsider knowledge: Several fabulous walking tours cover historic neighbourhoods, such\nas Adams Morgan, U Street, Georgetown and Dupont Circle.\nCheck out DC Insider Tours or take to the streets yourself by following trails, including the Civil Rights Heritage Trail, downloaded from cultural tourismdc.org (available for your mobile device).", "external_links": ["http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/07/1227432/512518-fbf873ea-2159-11e5-bfd8-23d4937b5704.jpg", "http://nmai.si.edu/visit/washington/mitsitam-caf%C3%A9", "http://theredhendc.com/", "http://www.thecoffeebardc.com/", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/07/1227432/512263-9313f0e2-209c-11e5-97a8-3165311c9b30.jpg", "http://hyatt.com/corporate/restaurants/blue-duck-tavern/en/blue-duck-tavern-home/menus.html", "http://www.sofitel.com/gb/hotel-3293-sofitel-washington-dc-lafayette-square/index.shtml", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/07/1227432/512572-fd2ad49c-2159-11e5-bfd8-23d4937b5704.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/07/1227432/512652-90cde7ac-209c-11e5-97a8-3165311c9b30.jpg", "http://loc.gov/visit", "http://daikaya.com/index.htm", "http://filtercoffeehouse.com/", "http://www.si.edu/", "http://www.twinsjazz.com/", "http://www.dcinsidertours.com/", "http://www.drinkmoresherry.com/", "http://www.phillipscollection.org/", "http://www.embassyrowhotel.com/", "http://bluejacketdc.com/", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/07/1227432/512626-f9657c54-2159-11e5-bfd8-23d4937b5704.jpg", "http://www.tourismdc.org/", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/", "http://www.embassysuitesdcmetro.com/", "http://estadio-dc.com/", "http://archives.gov/dc-metro/washington/", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/07/1227432/512155-dab9aff2-2387-11e5-8ccd-f7b7065e2992.jpg", "http://www.kennedy-center.org/", "http://rasikarestaurant.com/", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/07/1227432/512047-ff627d14-2159-11e5-bfd8-23d4937b5704.jpg", "http://www.redapronbutchery.com/", "https://www.visitthecapitol.gov/", "http://irongaterestaurantdc.com/", "http://churchkeydc.com/", "http://bakedandwired.com/", "http://thewydown.com/", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/07/1227432/512073-faaedfc4-2159-11e5-bfd8-23d4937b5704.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/07/1227432/512101-f85838c4-2159-11e5-bfd8-23d4937b5704.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-12T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T00:23:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
