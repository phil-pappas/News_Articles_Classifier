We went [as guests] of Chanel, and it was lovely. Kristen and I had been working together for several years at that point, so it was really more like a family vacation. We stayed at Le Meurice, across the street from the Jardin des Tuileries. The trip was jam-packed with dinners, drinks, and events. Kristen and I went to two shows together: Zuhair Murad, which was small—only two rows—and Chanel, which was on a much grander scale. That show was at the Grand Palais, and it was a sweltering 105 degrees, so everyone was sweating in their Chanel looks. Kristen wore the classic tweed blazer, which we mixed up with some leather gloves and [weather-appropriate] cutoffs. She got a lot of attention. This was before she starred in the Chanel campaigns; by the time we returned the following year, Kristen was the face of the brand.”\n—as told to The Thick\nSee More: My First Time: Eric Wilson\nSee More: Questionnaire: Alexandre Vauthier\nSee More: Collections: Isaac Mizrahi", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php", "http://www.thethick.com/eric-wilson/", "http://www.thethick.com/isaac-mizrahi/", "http://www.thethick.com/alexandre-vauthier/"], "published": "2015-07-13T22:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T20:48:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
