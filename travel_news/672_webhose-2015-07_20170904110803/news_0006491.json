The new codeshare arrangement will provide vital connections between Vava’u and Nadi (weekly) and Suva (twice weekly) via Nuku’alofa.\nFiji Airways will operate a Nuku’alofa – Vava’u flight three days per week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Real Tonga will be code-sharing on that flight, so that the new services are an integral part of the Real Tonga schedule. The services will be operated by Fiji Link’s brand new ATR 72 aircraft, offering customers comfort and convenience.\nTevita Palu, CEO of Real Tonga said: “This commercial arrangement is a major step forward for Tongan Aviation. It enables Real Tonga to provide extra capacity when most needed in the peak seasons to satisfy the demand and enable the market to grow. Aside from making it easier for Tongans to travel between the capital and Vava’u, these key air links will be a tremendous boost to the island’s tourism. This is the start to developing a relationship between the two carriers.”\nDavid Bowden, Fiji Airways Acting CEO said: “Our new arrangement makes Vava’u a valuable new addition to our network, and directly links the island to the United States, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. This is a big boost for Vava’u – to be plugged into our route network and sales capabilities.”\nMr. Bowden added: This is the start of what we hope will be a fruitful partnership that will lead to more sustainable solutions for Tongan aviation and tourism. “Fiji Airways is working on a number of partnerships like these with Pacific nations. As an airline extensively covering this region, we’re well aware of the unique challenges some of our neighbours face when it comes to aviation. We’re always keen to assist where we can.”\nThe Nuku’alofa-Vava’u flights will operate on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.\nSource:- Fiji Airways\nRelated Posts Qatar Executive To Exhibit At Leading Business Aviation Show In Dubai Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building BOC Aviation Marks 20th Year With Record Net Profit in 2013 Norwegian announced three long-haul routes to America MIA Director, National Counterparts Travel To Washington, D.c.
