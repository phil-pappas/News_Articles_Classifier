But as housing demand outpaces housing supply, renters are bearing the resulting brunt of rent increases. Understandably, for renters who want to halt these rising costs, rent control sounds like an appealing idea.\nSome politicians are seizing upon the heated emotions of tenants to build support for their political aspiration. Who wouldn’t like to have their rent stabilized?\nBut rent control is a pipe dream. It can’t happen anytime soon, if at all, and it runs counter to creating affordable, quality housing.\nThe lure of rent control is the argument that it would make housing more affordable and would prevent rent hikes. The only seeming downside would be a revenue loss for landlords, who are perceived as “1 percenters,” and for wealthy corporations. But according to the Rental Housing Association, around 87 percent of landlords own fewer than 10 units — of those landlords, the vast majority actually own four units or fewer. In other words, a blow to the small-sized landlord is a blow to Seattle’s economy.\nIn the long run, Seattle needs to tackle a much bigger issue: the lack of housing. It’s the root of the housing affordability problem and can be boiled down to this: When supply is limited, demand goes up and higher rents follow. With an increased supply, demand and rents decrease. Logically, the solution then is to increase housing supply.\nJohn Okamoto is a member of the Seattle City Council. This is where we should be expending our energy — creating affordable housing units, not chasing an unreachable dream that diminishes both housing supply and quality.\nWhen rent is controlled, landlords pull in less income and have less incentive to maintain their units. Properties leave the housing market as they fall into disrepair and are abandoned. New development ceases as developers find more attractive investments outside the housing market or in other cities that offer a better return. Housing supply dwindles and can’t meet demand, leaving a city with a housing crisis worse than the one Seattle already has.\nConsider cautionary tales like New York City and San Francisco. In New York City, any apartment seeker can attest to the nightmare of finding an apartment, much less an affordable apartment. The city has been combating its housing shortage for decades as a result of its rent regulations and has been trying to move away from rent control, deregulating more than 231,000 units in the last 30 years.\nIn any case, let’s learn from other cities that have done the legwork for us.” San Francisco is also combating a housing shortage. To make matters worse, rent regulations there don’t even help the intended population. The city’s last study from 2000 found that one-fourth of households in rent-controlled apartments earned more than $100,000 a year.\nWith Seattle’s fast-growing population and housing demand igniting the debate around housing affordability, proponents of rent control are pressing the City Council to take a stance on the issue. The real power, though, lies with the state Legislature.\nWashington banned rent regulation in 1981. By law, cities cannot enact rent-control legislation. So, even if Seattle were in favor of the measure, the state Legislature would have to come on board.\nThat is a high hurdle — one that won’t be cleared.\nSince moving the needle in the Legislature requires a great deal of effort, the common-sense approach is to prioritize the issues on the state legislative agenda that have both a good chance of passing in the Legislature and working in the real world.\nRegardless of whether rent control is good policy (it’s not), we shouldn’t spin our wheels in the Legislature when we have several other tasks and requests that have greater momentum and higher priorities.\nIn any case, let’s learn from other cities that have done the legwork for us. Rent control not only fails to address the housing affordability crisis, it exacerbates the issue in the long term.\nJohn Okamoto is a member of the Seattle City Council.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T14:16:28.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
