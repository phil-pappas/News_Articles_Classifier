The trains will enter into service during the autumn 2017 in Denmark, in particular on the Nordjyllands network.\nThe Coradia Lint 41 is an environmentally friendly low-consumption Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU) that can reach a maximum operating speed of up to 140 km/h. The 2-unit trains ordered by Nordjyske Jernbane have a total of 125 seats and up to 135 places for standing passengers. They offer full accessibility to all passengers, including people with reduced mobility, thanks to barrier-free entrances. The trains feature spacious multi-purpose areas with sufficient storage space for wheelchairs, bicycles and strollers. They are also equipped with air conditioning, passenger information system and video surveillance guaranteeing a high level of passenger comfort and safety. The trains are built in Alstom’s Salzgitter plant in Germany.\n“I am looking forward to expand Nordjyske Jernbane commercial service in the North Jutland region thanks to the procurement of the passenger friendly Lint trains”, says Peter Hvilshøj, CEO of Nordjyske Jernbane.\n“We will supply Nordjyske Jernbane with a train that has shown remarkably high and solid track-record on punctuality and reliability. With this new order, Denmark will then have approximately 100 Lint regional trains running in passenger operation”, says Christian Algreen-Ussing, Managing Director of Alstom Transport for Denmark.\nCoradia Lint is part of Alstom’s Coradia range of modular trains that benefit from over 30 years of experience and proven technical solutions. Alstom has sold more than 3,000 of its regional trains.\nRelated Posts CN offers conductors’ union in Canada one last chance to reach a contract settlement through negotiation; requires upfront union acceptance of binding arbitration if talks fail Expanded Train Services From Decmber 2013 – Scot Rail Dangerous behaviour at level crossings caught on dash cam The Slopes are Calling!
