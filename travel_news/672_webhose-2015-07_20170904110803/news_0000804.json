Adv: \nJul 29, 2015 Adv: \nLISBON, Portugal - The Lisbon MBA and Turismo de Portugal jointly launched a worldwide competition of ideas and technology – the Tourism Innovation Competition – which will reward the most innovative solution to measure the behavior of tourists in the countries and / or cities they visit. The competition aims to help design the behavior of tourists and simultaneously promote innovation, entrepreneurship and knowledge sharing in the tourism sector, taking into consideration that the identity of The Lisbon MBA is also based on these three characteristics. \nThe winning idea will receive a prize of €10,000 or a €18,000 scholarship for the The Lisbon MBA. The other two finalists will receive €2,000 each.
