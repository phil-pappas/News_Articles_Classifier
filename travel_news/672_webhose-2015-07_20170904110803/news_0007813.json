It has since raised it further following the Sousse atrocity. \n“Travel companies should have the capability to understand the threats and monitor the countries where they operate, and not just rely on FCO advice,” he said. “They have to be happy with the security arrangements in place. \n“This should also be done to monitor places where threats are dropping off because this could allow travel companies to develop opportunities in areas which may have suffered an attack some time ago.” \nWilkinson said Morocco was a destination where it had lowered the threat level from terrorism in the past two years. \nHe said tourism was the second most targeted commercial sector globally after the retail sector. \nData shows there were 31 incidents of tourists being attacked across the world in the past 12 months. \n“Broadly speaking, the number of attacks have been consistent in the past few years - what has changed is that the number of fatalities has gone up recently,” said Wilkinson. \nCurrent FCO advice on Tunisia says “further terrorist attacks are likely” but it has stopped short of advising against all non-essential travel. \nPrime minister David Cameron has said this will be kept “under close review”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T12:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T05:01:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
