The game is believed to have developed in medieval times on the short-grassed grazing land in the south-east – Sussex and Surrey also lay claim to the early roots of cricket. There are references to the game going back to the 16th century and before, but possibly the first recorded cricket match was in 1610, in Chevening, Kent, between teams from the Downs and the Weald. Despite its venerable history, Kent cricket hasn’t been without controversy. In 1822, during a match between MCC and Kent at Lord’s, Kent bowler John Willes was said by the umpire to have bowled a no-ball because of his “round-arm” action, with the arm out at 90 degrees to the body, rather than the conventional under-arm action. He flounced off the pitch and refused to play in a major match again, but the round-arm revolution had begun. The action was legalised by MCC in 1835, and was WG Grace’s preferred method of bowling, even after over-arm bowling was deemed acceptable in 1865. In honour of the Kent team, here’s an uncontroversially Kentish recipe. Gypsy tart is a super-sweet but delicious local delicacy. And when I say sweet, I really mean it: these are in the same league as sticky toffee pudding. Legend has it that a Kentish lady, spying some hungry gypsy children through the window, whipped up a tart for them with what she had in the cupboard: sugar, butter, flour and evaporated milk. I bet the sweet mousse-filled tart, with its sugary crust, knocked the kids for six – and cricket teams will be similarly impressed at teatime these days. Gypsy tartlet recipe Makes 24. Although traditionally a gypsy tart is one large tart, it makes sense to cook mini versions for a cricket tea. If you prefer to make one big tart, use a 10in/25cm tart tin. Either way, the filling is so sweet that I like to add a squeeze of lemon juice, but it’s not strictly authentic. 500g/1lb 2oz shortcrust pastry (not the sweetened kind) 400g tin of evaporated milk 340g/12oz dark muscovado sugar Squeeze of lemon juice (optional) Greek yoghurt and strawberries to serve (optional) Pre-heat the oven to Gas 6/200C. Line each hole in two 12-hole muffin tins with a muffin or fairy cake case. Roll out the pastry and cut rounds about 8cm/3in around and press into the muffin cases, to make a case about 2cm/¾in deep (the exact size will depend on the size of your tins). Chill in the fridge for half an hour. With a pair of scissors, trim the muffin cases back to the top of the pastry, cutting away any ragged pastry edges in the process. Pop a second paper case in each pastry case to line it, and fill with rice or baking beans. Bake for seven minutes, then remove the beans or rice and paper liners and return to the oven for another couple of minutes, until the cases are cooked through. Put the evaporated milk and sugar in an electric mixer and beat for ten minutes until thick and creamy. Add the lemon juice, if using, and whisk briefly again. Fill the cases up to the top with the mixture and bake for 10 minutes. Cool completely in the tins then lever out gently. Serve with a blob of Greek yoghurt and half a strawberry if you like.
