Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Jul 20, 2015 Adv: \nAir Kenya announced yesterday that they will with immediate effect halt operations into the Masai Maraâ€™s main airfield, Keekorok, affecting tourists and locals alike. With the annual migration in full swing, demand for air safaris is high, and dropping this airstrip will no doubt cause challenges for lodge and camp operators which rely on the use of this particular airfield. \nFlights were cancelled due to the condition of the strip. The airline issued the following statement to explain their action: \nStart quote: \nThe condition of Keekorok airstrip has in the recent past deteriorated below Airkenya's minimum safety standards. Some of our aircraft have had flat tyres due to the poor state of Keekorok airstrip thus causing major delays and highly inconveniencing our passengers. \nFor this reason Airkenya is stopping operation with all aircraft into Keekorok effective from tomorrow, Tuesday, July 21, 2015 until further notice. \nWe have been in touch with the relevant authorities to work on the airstrip. \nWe request that Agents/passengers who are booked to Keekorok Airstrip will be dropped to Olkiombo Airstrip instead, unless we are advised on the next best alternative airstrip for Drop/Pick. \nPlease call AIRKENYA on Tel. 391 6000 to advise on next best alternative airstrip if Olkiombo will not be convenient. \nWe would also like to take this opportunity to remind all Agents/Passengers that Nairobi is a beehive of activity this week. We kindly request that you will plan ahead to get passengers to Wilson Airport in good time, even if they do arrive two hours before flight departure. Remember, we have the DORMANS Coffee Shop, and your passengers can enjoy a hot meal before their flight. \nIf you have any questions on the above or any related matter, please do not hesitate to let us know by calling 391-6000. \nEnd quote \nIt could not be ascertained, due to the short time available, if other airlines operating scheduled services from Wilson airport to the Masai Mara will follow suit and also halt operations into this airfield, but going by past experience is it likely that the air operators will stand together over questions of flight safety. Clients booked on flights into the Masai Mara are, therefore, urged to contact their safari operators and seek clarification, if indeed their flights were due to go in or out of this airfield.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T05:21:12.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
