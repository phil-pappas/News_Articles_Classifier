This percentage includes insurance purchases for a variety of trips - including cruises, tours, group travel, and long-and-short trips internationally or within the US. \n\"The data suggests that the majority of travelers are selecting comprehensive plans because they provide broader coverage to protect their needs,\" say InsureMyTrip CEO Jim Grace. \nComprehensive travel insurance plans offers the most protection for travelers. These provide a variety of benefits including trip cancellation, trip interruption, emergency medical coverage, emergency medical evacuation, 24/7 emergency assistance, travel delay and baggage protection. Plans typically run 4-8% of total trip cost. \nExample: For a $5,000 two week vacation to Aruba, a comprehensive travel insurance plan will cost a couple in their 50s around $200. This includes a $50,000 medical limit, $250,000 for medical evacuation in addition to trip cancellation coverage and other benefits. \nTravel medical protection plans are the second most requested type of travel insurance. These plans provide emergency medical coverage, emergency medical evacuation and 24/7 emergency assistance. Trip cancellation is typically not included. \nExample: For the same trip to Aruba, a travel medical insurance plan will cost a couple in their 50s around $80. This includes a $50,000 medical limit with a $250 deductible and $500,000 medical evacuation and other benefits. No trip cancellation benefits.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T04:51:52.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
