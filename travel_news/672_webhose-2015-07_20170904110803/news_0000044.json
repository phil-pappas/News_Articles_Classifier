So much, I could have written it myself. In fact, I have written it myself. Week after week, month upon month, year on year in this very column . Those of us who are furious that a policy of cultural appeasement has been adopted towards people who wish to import attitudes and practices that are hostile to our country’s values have had a pretty lonely time of it, to be honest. “Please don’t write about it any more,” my mum pleads. “I know you’re right, but it makes me nervous.” Still, I keep going, because I know from your letters and emails how strongly Telegraph readers feel about a subject which, at root, is nothing less than a battle for the soul of the United Kingdom. For our right to be us. To be told that we were racist if we dared to ask why we should tolerate something that was clearly intolerable. To be warned that we were “damaging community relations” if we pointed out that men of mainly Pakistani origin were getting away with raping and pimping thousands of (mainly) white girls. (Men who carried out those vile crimes safe in the knowledge that “racially sensitive” police and social workers wouldn’t lay a finger on them.) To be taken to task for hating the fact that women in 21st century Britain should cover their faces in the abominable burqa. Outrageous, all of it. I could tell the wind was changing when I got an email from a producer on BBC One’s Question Time, asking me to appear on the panel. He’d heard me on Radio 4’s Any Questions from Bradford and he reckoned that now, you know, it, er, might be OK to start, um, saying some of these sort of things. Things no one was allowed to say on the BBC, because they had the indisputable drawback of being both embarrassing and true. I thought back to an edition of Question Time where every single member of the panel said, in all seriousness, that the rapists of Rotherham and Rochdale were just paedophiles and most paedophiles were white men. So no need to worry about misogyny in the Muslim community, warped political correctness or white girls being treated like trash, is there? Phew! I ask you, has any nation ever displayed such a capacity for self-delusion? The creed of multiculturalism, which was getting its claws into our society when I did teacher training back in the early Eighties, said that all cultures were equal. When one of those cultures cuts off the sexual parts of little girls or demonises gay people or Jews or teaches its young boys that white women are no better than a sweetie in the gutter, well, that is somewhat unfortunate, obviously, but the main thing, what matters above all else, is that we should respect diversity. In Trevor Phillips's documentary 'Things We Can’t Say About Race That Are True'm he said multiculturalism was a \"racket\" in much of the UK Like hell we should. As Trevor Phillips said in his devastating documentary Things We Can’t Say About Race That Are True, during the Blair years multiculturalism became a “racket” in many parts of the UK. White officials went on racial-awareness courses while self-styled “community leaders” got public funds to prop up their authority and entrench segregation. Politicians signed a Faustian pact: grants for votes. Far from encouraging integration, it had become in the interest of community leaders to preserve the isolation of their ethnic groups. And, boy, did they succeed. Jihadi John , gruesome Beheader-in-Chief of Isil, attended a London secondary school where 70 per cent of the pupils were Muslim. Might such a closed existence, untouched by the boisterous give and take of ordinary British life, have nurtured a narrow and poisonous perspective? Would John have loathed the kuffar quite so much had he actually had the chance to sit next to one of us in double maths? You’re not allowed to ask that, I’m afraid. It’s Islamophobic. One of this country’s greatest poets wrote that no man is an island. But dear old John Donne never went on a diversity awareness course – what could he know? Over the past 35 years, multiculturalism has made sure that far too many British men and women are islands, perilously adrift from the main and living in ghettoes where children will never come to know the country they were born in, let alone love it. On Monday afternoon, David Cameron rolled up his sleeves and started to put that right. His speech may have been too tactful and nuanced for some, but its tone of sweet reason cloaked a tough message. The PM, who is more aware than anyone of how many terrorist attacks are foiled every month by our security services, had clearly weighed up the risks of further alienating Muslim opinion and decided to go for it. He promised parents the power to cancel their children’s passports if they feared they might be going to Syria, which put the responsibility back where it belongs – in the family. He poured scorn on infantile conspiracy theories, which allow Muslims to blame everyone, except themselves, for their woes. \"The PM had clearly weighed up the risks of further alienating Muslim opinion and decided to go for it\" Cunningly, he mentioned basic liberal values, “such as democracy, freedom and sexual equality”, and said that extremists are trying to undermine our shared values “and make Muslims feel like they don’t belong here”. What he actually meant was too many Muslims don’t share our shared values – particularly regarding sexual equality – and that has to change or they don’t belong here. He was properly excoriating about the heinous practice of female genital mutilation and forced marriages, which have increased, not declined, and he decried “the passive tolerance of practices running totally contrary to our own values”. The failure of police, social services and councillors to tackle child sex abuse in places like Rotherham was “frankly unforgiveable”. Hallelujah! To hear so many phrases from the Pearson hymn book on the Prime Minister’s lips was heaven. Finally, we have a leader who is unafraid to speak the problems aloud and to challenge the false creed of multiculturalism, which has caused so much harm and division in our society. Putting it right is another matter. On the recent tenth anniversary of the 7/7 bombings, a poll by the Huffington Post revealed that 56 per cent of Britons now believe that Islam (not Islamist extremists) is a major or some threat to Western liberal democracy. There has been a decrease in the number of people agreeing that most British Muslims are “peaceful, law-abiding citizens who deplore terror attacks in the name of Islam”. Just a fifth of people (20 per cent) said this phrase applied to “practically all” Muslims. Trust has to be rebuilt from the ground up. Education is key. The PM said that all new faith schools would be obliged to have a proportion of children from other religions. I say he needs to go further and make that apply, retrospectively, to existing faith schools as well. Small children know how to love instinctively; it’s hatred they have to be taught. And let’s make it compulsory for everyone to learn English ; that will make it harder for misogynists to lock their women in the past. For a vision of what integration might be, look no further than England cricketer Moeen Ali , who seems to have no struggle reconciling his Muslim beliefs and a long black beard with fierce patriotism and joyful camaraderie. Or Mishal Husain, the wonderful and preternaturally serene British-Pakistani news anchor. Or Gogglebox’s Siddiqui family from Derby . Just a bunch of blokes sitting in front of the telly, laughing, bickering and taking the mick like everyone else. Extremely British, the Siddiquis give off no sense of them and us. Their affection for their country is clear, and viewers love them back. It’s really that simple, and that hard. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T05:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T02:08:56.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
