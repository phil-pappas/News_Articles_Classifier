I shall call you Fred,' and he called me Fred from then on!\" Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif in Lawrence Of Arabia (1962) On his favourite movies “I don’t watch any films. Billy Elliot is the only film I’ve seen in the last 25 years. Oh, and ET. Both of which I loved!” • Omar Sharif tribute: Hollywood's nearly man His verdict on Lawrence of Arabia \"I think it is a great film, but I am not very good in it. I also never thought anyone would go to see the film – three hours and 40 minutes of desert, and no girls!” • Omar Sharif in pictures Imagining life without Lawrence of Arabia \"I'll never know what my life would have been like if they hadn't made Lawrence of Arabia. What would I be? I would maybe have 10 children, a very fat wife. I would be very fat myself. I don't know.\" On his prowess as a lover \"See these hands? They are old. But they are soft. Only good for caressing.\" Omar Sharif and Julie Christie in Doctor Zhivago (1965) On sex \"Making love? It's communion with a woman. The bed is our holy table. There I find passion and purification.\" On modern actors “People don’t have to be beautiful any more. We don’t have any Audrey Hepburns , Rita Hayworths or Ava Gardeners. When you look at Al Pacino and the greatest actors in Hollywood they’re all common-looking.” On his illegitimate son Ruben, fathered with an Italian journalist in 1969 \"I don’t consider him to be my son, although I concede that he was probably produced by a sperm of mine. But then it is possible that I might have 100,000 sons.\" On being cast by David Lean in Lawrence of Arabia \"They chose me for Lawrence of Arabia because I spoke English, had black hair, black eyes and a moustache. It was all luck.\" \"I was taken in a plane to the desert to meet David, and as we came in to land we could see him sitting all by himself. We landed right next to him, but he didn't move one step. When I got off the plane, he didn't say 'hello'. He simply walked round me to see my profile. Finally, he said 'That's very good, Omar. Let's go to the make-up tent.' I tried on a moustache, and it was decided I would grow one. I've shaved it off for a couple of films, but otherwise I've had it ever since.\" • Omar Shariff's best roles: in video On Barbra Streisand, his co-star in Funny Girl \"I thought she was not very attractive at first. But gradually she cast her spell over me. I fell madly in love with her talent. The feeling was mutual for four months — the time it took to shoot the movie.\" On Dr Zhivago \"It took us 13 months to make the movie altogether, and after three months no one says I'm good! They would say, 'Did you see Julie Christie today?' I was having a nervous breakdown.\" On gambling “I don’t think I could live without a deck of cards in my hands.” Omar Sharif - key dates in his life 1932 Born Michael Chalhoub in Alexandria on April 10 1954 Leading role in Egyptian film The Blazing Sun 1955 Marries Faten Hamama, one of Arabic cinema’s favourite actresses Late 1950s Converts to Islam and changes his name to Omar El-Sharif and appears in 23 Arabic-speaking films 1958 Appears in Goha, French film directed by Jacques Baratier 1960 Plays a sheikh in The Fabulous Adventures of Marco Polo Early 1960s Drops the “El” from his name 1962 Stars opposite Peter O’Toole in Lawrence of Arabia 1964 The Fall of the Roman Empire 1964 Behold a Pale Horse 1964 The Yellow Rolls-Royce 1965 Stars with Julie Christie in Doctor Zhivago 1967 Cinderella, Italian Style with Sophia Loren 1968 Stars in Funny Girl with Barbra Streisand 1969 Mayerling 1969 Mackenna’s Gold 1970 The Last Valley, with Michael Caine 1971 The Horsemen 1974 Juggernaut 1974 The Tamarind Seed, with Julie Andrews 1975 Funny Lady with Barbra Streisand 1979 Ashanti 1984 Top Secret 1984 (for television) The Far Pavilions 1986 (for television) Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna and Harem 1995 (for television) Catherine the Great 2003 Monsieur Ibrahim (awarded a César for his role as an elderly Turkish shopkeeper) 2004 (for television) The Ten Commandments Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T10:07:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
