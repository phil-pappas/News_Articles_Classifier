When booking one of the firm’s exclusive villas, guests can ‘add-on’ an exclusive DJ masterclass, where they will learn the basics of mixing, fading and other techniques, from an internationally-known DJ. \nLessons will take place in one of Ibiza’s founding underground clubs, the late night Experience Bar, within the island’s original boutique hotel, Es Vive. Over each two-hour tutorial, guests will learn to spin with one of the club’s resident DJs, who have all previously mixed annuals of the hotel’s sought-after eponymous CDs. Co-Founder of Chic Ibiza Villas, Nick Reid states: “This is an exciting new offering for us. We’re sure guests who try out the masterclass will come away having had a lot of fun, with some new skills they can try out at home. Where better to learn DJ techniques than Ibiza, the world’s home to house, dance, techno and EDM.” Best crash pad for budding DJs Chic Ibiza Villas recommends music-lovers book Villa Moonraker on the island - a modern villa sleeping 11. ￼ The property perfectly combines contemporary style, with a touch of luxury. From its roof terrace, guests can bask in 180% views of rolling hills and sister islets scattered out to sea, whilst lounging on a luxury day bed. And guests will adore this villa’s piece de resistance, as Moonraker boasts its very own private own basement club complete with decks and a full sound system.
