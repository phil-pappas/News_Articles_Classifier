Ranked by the United Nations as one of the most dangerous cities in the world, and stifled by hyperinflation, it is a sprawling, smoggy South American metropolis that few foreign tourists now dare visit. Divided national support for Hugo Chavez’s successor, Nicolas Maduro, along with deadly protests and crippling product shortages have turned Venezuela ’s capital into a city of dramatic headlines and emotive news flashes. But as I jumped aboard a bus destined for the Andean city of Merida, I wanted to see if the country beyond Caracas was suffering in the same way. I wanted to uncover a different side of Venezuela. The state of a country’s roads usually provides a decent barometer of the level of development and industry to be found there, and just 10 miles outside the city my bus was gliding along smooth, sealed asphalt. This is a tangible remnant of Venezuela’s historic prosperity from a seemingly endless supply of petroleum, but while the roads may now be flat, the economy faces a bumpy future. On the black market, 100 US dollars had bought me 22,500 Venezuelan bolívars as opposed to the 1,000 if I had opted to use an ATM. At this exchange rate, I calculated, I could afford well over a thousand bottles of beer. • Venezuela: piranha fishing in the Orinoco Delta As I travelled west through dusty checkpoints manned by teenage military police grasping ancient Kalashnikovs, I began seeing a vivid and varied country. Geographically, Venezuela was presenting itself as a constantly changing landscape of parched savannahs and lush pockets of rainforest, teeming with reared livestock and wild bird life. Crimson-headed turkey vultures soared overhead, while dozy, lowing cattle nibbled at the parched spinifex, and red howler monkeys lazed in the curved bows of acacia trees. Bulging mangoes, giant avocados and plump mini bananas could be bought at the side of the bustling highways for as little as a few pence a bag, and the smell of oven-fresh empanadas wafted through the tropical heat every time my bus manoeuvred through the sporadically located villages or townships. The urban sprawl of Caracas and the problems associated with it were becoming a welcome, distant memory. In the Los Llanos grasslands, 300 or so miles from the capital, I found a region bursting with exotic birds, reptiles and mammals. I spotted freshwater dolphins, caiman, giant anteaters, capybaras and anacondas swimming, paddling and slithering among these pulsating prairies. Black collard hawks dive-bombed piranhas around my wooden canoe like crazed kamikaze fighter pilots as I buzzed down the Guaratico River, while long-legged jabirus waded through the copper-tinged water beneath me. With a band of vivid crimson wrapping around their broad, feathered necks, dividing a body of shimmering white plumage and a maroon-crested brow, they reminded me of neckerchief-wearing bull runners in Pamplona. Christopher Columbus once described Venezuela as “paradise on Earth” and it didn’t take much of an imagination to see why. Despite the occasional roadside internet café or faux-European football shirt, it felt like a new and undiscovered world, operating under the radar of the rest of the planet. Europeans now take low-cost air travel for granted, as we do wide-reaching train networks and convenient airports. In South America, these are largely non-existent. Buses are the only realistic way to move from place to place, and in Venezuela I was clocking up some formidable bus hours. • The world's most 'miserable' countries Arriving in the mountain city of Merida after two long and humid 16-hour days sat motionless, I peeled myself from my seat like a freshly baked flapjack stuck to parchment. I had left temperatures in excess of 104F (40C) in Los Llanos and humidity nearing 100 per cent, but here the climate reminded me of the French Alps in April, shortly after the spring thaw. I love hot and tropical weather, but in Merida I was genuinely excited to wear a jumper. At 1,600m above sea level, Venezuela’s extreme sports capital is cherished by locals for having one of the most agreeable climates in the tropics. From a hillside overlooking the city I could see a series of rocky valleys winding away across the horizon. I drank in the cool air as the parachute attached to my trembling legs filled with a hearty gust. Before I had time to snatch another breath, I was airborne. Tandem paragliding high above the Andes and soaring through rising thermals just yards from the radiating rock face, I could see cars whizzing from the city like frantic bacteria under a microscope. I have flown in planes many hundreds of times, but this felt completely different. Air travel is almost always accompanied by a monotonous drone of engine noise, but high above Merida the only sound was from an occasional flutter of our parachute. For just £20 it was the thriftiest buzz I have ever experienced. Four beers in a London pub have never felt more expensive, compared with a rush like this. I thudded back to earth grinning and invigorated. I was in awe of this country and what I had already found, but before leaving I had one final pilgrimage to make. I was hoping to view one of the planet’s least-known, but no less impressive natural phenomena. Formed over the mouth of the Catatumbo river when cold mountain air collides with the heat of Lake Maracaibo, the “Catatumbo lightning” entered the Guinness Book of World Records this year as the most likely place on the planet to see lightning. I was there at the start of the viewing season that runs from April to October, but as I stepped on to the bobbing pontoon belonging to Barbadian Alan Highton, known simply as “the Lightning Man”, I was still hopeful that I could catch a precious glimpse. “Sometimes we get more than 100,000 lightning strikes a night,” said Highton as he showed me around his simple house built on stilts. “I can see the phenomena building over there in the distance,” he said, pointing at a tower of rising cloud. “It’s either that or a hurricane. Either way, we could be in for a fun night.” • Would you take the kids to Colombia? Six beers, two steaks and five hours’ sleep later, Highton woke me as a flash of light filled the sky around my swaying hammock. I could feel a charged energy in the air, and as I flopped on to the deck with the uneasy grace of an Englishman on a foreign flotilla, another flash illuminated the tropical scene around me. It felt like I had woken up in a black and white world in which each flash of lightning added another snap to a constantly circulating roll of film. Every blaze of light was different, and although the flashes numbered just a dozen or so each minute (compared with 250 in peak season), I was receiving a mouth-watering taste of this phenomenon, straight from mother nature’s turbulent mixing bowl. Reaching 10,000m into the night sky, the lightning reminded me of accounts I had read of the aurora borealis. The spectacle was loud visually but silent in an auditory sense and I was amazed at the variation of lightning strikes above me. Some lit up high sections of the atmosphere like heavenly smites, while others zigzagged horizontally through the lower reaches of the sky like a child waving a fizzing sparkler on bonfire night. I felt like I was looking up at filaments of charged energy detonating within a giant light bulb, but sadly I could already feel night turning to day. As a dirty, grey murk spread over the lake, I watched as the lightning began to dissipate over the horizon and, with it, my adventure in one of Latin America’s least-visited nations was coming to an end. With 5,000 bolívars left in my pocket, however, I still had enough money for at least another 250 beers. Getting there Air Europa (0871 423 0717; aireuropa.com/en/flights ) flies twice weekly to Caracas from London Gatwick, with return fares from £652. Tour operator Simon Parker travelled with Tucan Travel (0800 804 8435; tucantravel.com ) on its 29-day Cartagena Overland Tour. Travel advice The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advises against all travel to within 50 miles of Venezuela’s border with Colombia, where drug traffickers and armed groups operate. It also urges vigilance in cities including Caracas and Merida, where political protests have taken place.
