Available for Personal, Small Business and Corporate Card Members, the redesigned app includes the convenience of Touch ID™ login, nearby offers on a map, rewards information and unique mobile service features like on-the-spot fraud alert verification.\nThe updated features and modern design allow users to make the most of their American Express Membership. The app not only makes it simple to pay your bill on the go, but also provides value to our Card Members with a broad set of features:\nSign in faster with Touch ID for supported devices with iOS 8+ Stay on top of spending: View payment status when you log in Access real time transaction activity (pending and posted charges) in a timeline Access Benefits and Rewards: View Card benefits and Membership Reward® balances Use Membership Rewards points for eligible charges in the app. Terms apply.

With the redesigned platform, we’re just getting started to make all the amazing services we offer our Card Members come alive in mobile,” said David Yoo, Senior Vice President, Mobile Products and Services.\nListening to customer needs is top-of-mind for American Express. iPhone users requested Touch ID, and in December 2014 American Express became one of the first US financial services companies to offer this feature. The redesigned app also brings our iPhone and Android users’ needs front and center. The user experience is now native to each operating system, including iPhone 6 and 6 Plus optimization, and brings Amex Offers to the Android platform. Now, Card Member services, benefits, and offers are just a few taps away.\nCard Members can download the latest app from the App StoreSM and the Google Play™ store. Card Members can also text AMEXMOBILE to 86509 to receive a link to download on their iPhone running iOS 7.0+ or Android phone running 4.3+.
