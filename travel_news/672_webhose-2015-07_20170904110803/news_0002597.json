Please go ahead, ma'am. Ellen West (Vice President, Investor Relations): Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Google's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Omid Kordestani. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. Please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website later today. Now let me quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2014 filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.google.com. I'll now turn the call over to Ruth. Ruth Porat (CFO and SVP): Thanks. We had strong performance in the second quarter, notwithstanding the continuation of substantial currency headwinds. Key highlights this quarter include ongoing momentum in our core Search business, particularly mobile, complemented by significant growth in YouTube revenues. In addition, we are increasingly benefiting from the shift toward programmatic advertising, particularly among brand advertisers. These strong top line results were complemented by ongoing operating expense discipline in the quarter, as reflected in 13% year-over-year growth in GAAP operating income and 16% year-over-year growth in non-GAAP operating income. I will first go over a summary of the quarter, followed by specific financial details and conclude with themes for the near term. Omid will then cover the business and product highlights of the quarter, after which, we will take your questions. Beginning with the summary of our financial out. Total revenue was $17.7 billion, up 11% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. As a result of the ongoing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we realized a negative currency impact on our revenues of $1.6 billion or $1.1 billion after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 18% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. On a GAAP basis, operating profit was $4.8 billion and the operating margin was 27%. On a non-GAAP basis, that is excluding stock-based compensation, operating profit was $6 billion and the operating margin was 34%. GAAP net income was $3.9 billion, up 17% year-over-year and up 12% versus Q1. Non-GAAP net income was $4.8 billion, up 18% year-over-year and up 8% versus Q1. GAAP earnings per diluted share for Class A and B shares were $4.93 and for Class C were $6.43. Higher EPS for Class C reflects the impact of the adjustment payment made in Q2. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $6.99. 1 of 13", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T18:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T19:14:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
