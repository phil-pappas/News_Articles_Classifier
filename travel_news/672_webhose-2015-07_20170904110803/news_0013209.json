That area is pretty vibrant and lively, so it was nice to know I could escape to my own quieter piece of paradise and enjoy lovely stretches of empty beaches perfect for snorkelling, windsurfing and kids to run around.\" \nIn fact, for travellers who have never been to Asia and looking for a beach break, Jasmin still believes Thailand's bustling Phuket has plenty to offer. \n\"There are so many gorgeous resorts that cater specifically to families, with stacks of children's activities so mums and dads can relax too. Plus there's amazing luxury resorts and villas to relax and unwind or for the budget savy, a range of great value centrally located resorts and hotels.\" \nCloser to home, Jasmin's top picks of Tropical North Queensland include coastal fun around Cairns and Port Douglas.\"The landscape is just so beautiful and well-kept. White water rafting is great fun and seeing the rainforest canopy from the Skyrail cable car is pretty amazing.\" \n\"But nothing beats the Great Barrier Reef. I loved the Ocean Walker experience and kids get a real kick out of 'finding Nemo'.\" \nJasmin delivers amazing experiences for her Toowoomba customers, from cycling tours to luxury holidays, escorted tours to volunteering, cruising to beach breaks. Her friendly team at Flight Centre Toowoomba Plaza will put together a great holiday break to suit you! \nFor your next holiday call Flight Centre on 1300 499 787 . flight centre", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T23:29:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
