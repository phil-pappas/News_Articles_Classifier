This is one strong reason that fasting during Ramadan is considered the toughest ritual among others followed in the Islamic community. With long days and the searing heat of the summer, devotees who fast need to take special precautions and care in order to make sure that they remain healthy throughout the holy month.The average daily fasting period is up to 15 hours and it no doubt tests the inner strength and determination of the devotees. This is when the people need to manage the conditions which include diet, sleep and exercise to make sure that the bodies do not suffer anything. Below are some important tips which people must consider and follow when fasting during Ramadan.* Devotees indulging in fating must take care of the fact that they do not miss or skip Suhoor (pre-dawn meal). During Ramadan, the morning breakfast is all the more important as it gives the individuals some energy to work throughout the day. No wonder, skipping Suhoor may also encourage overeating during the Iftar, which can cause unhealthy weight gain or other health related issues.* Don't ever overeat during the Iftar (dinner). This is the time when one opens the fast and eating excess during this time may harm your body. Rather, Iftar should always be well-balanced, and must contain nutritious meals and not a feast which many people often include. Overeating may result in indigestion or other stomach disorders.* One must avoid eating high-sugar content foods, fried foods and salty foods as it is not recommended for the fasters to reward themselves with rich, greasy, fried and sugary dishes. These foods may give people some happiness for short term however they turn difficult during later part of the day. Rather, one should include more of fruits and vegetables, rice and alternatives, as well fibre rich fruit.* Water, which is also the basic necessity of life, must be taken in use as much as possible. People should drink maximum water so that the stomach remains filled and they do not feel hungry easily. Moreover, drinking water between Iftar (dinner) and Suhoor (pre-dawn meal) reduces the risk of dehydration during the fasting period.* It is best advised to stay indoors during the hottest part of the day. Individuals are advised to stay in cool areas (indoors or in shade) and limit their physical activity. Taking proper rest during the fasting period is equally important as the other activities are.
