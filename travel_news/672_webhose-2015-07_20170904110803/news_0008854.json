We plan to travel every day and use as many scenic trains as we can. We also want to go on the various rack and pinion, funicular and cog railways.\nDoc: A Swiss-Travel-Pass ( swiss-pass.ch/en ) would be the best for you. This pass provides unlimited travel on the Swiss Travel System.\nYou won’t have to worry about the cost of each journey as you will hold a prepaid ticket, saving you time and effort at train stations, bus terminals and boat docks.\nThe travel pass also allows you free entry into more than 480 museums.\nThe only decision you will need to make is which one suits you best. Your best options are the Swiss Travel Pass and the Swiss Travel Pass Flex Combi.\nThe first pass – available for three, four, eight or 15 days – entitles you to unlimited travel on consecutive days throughout the rail, bus and boat network. It also covers scenic routes and local trams and buses in more than 75 towns and cities and offers 50 per cent reduction on most mountain railways and cable cars. In first class the pass will be about $780 for eight days or about $480 in second.\nYour second option, the Flex Combi pass, allows you to choose non-consecutive days within a month, and provides a 50 per cent discount on bus and boats as well as most mountain railways and cable cars. Prices start at about $950 for an eight-day first-class ticket.\nRegional trains won’t require a reservation, but you will need to pre-book for the Bernina Express, the Chocolate Train, the Glacier Express and the Wilhelm Tell Express.\nBuy your ticket online and you will be emailed an invoice and PDF of your pass for you to print. You will simply show this plus your passport to the conductor on the train.\nIf you are looking for itinerary ideas and suggestions, the Swiss Pass website has put together three trips of four days each and an eight-day train and hotel package.\nBERLIN AND BEYOND\nI WILL have four days in Berlin in August before a river cruise. I haven’t visited this city before and need some guidance on what to see and do in this time frame. If possible I would like to visit a concentration camp and as I am travelling on my own, I would like guided tours as opposed to using public transport.\nDoc: You will no doubt wish to see the Berlin Wall, so to get an idea of how big it was and the history behind it, go to Bernauer Strasse and to the Memorial of the Berlin Wall.\nThe visitors’ centre on one side has a viewing platform, guided tours and admission is free. On the other side is an open-air exhibition and a monument in memory of the divided city.\nThere are many museums and exhibitions in Berlin to wander around. The Deutsches Historisches Museum is a good one to start with. This official national museum has more than 8000 objects detailing the history of the country. For more museums, head to Museum Island where you’ll find five museums all housing unique exhibitions.\nFor a guided tour to a concentration camp, Visit Berlin (visitberlin.de) provide day trips to the Memorial and Museum Sachsenhausen. This is a museum on the grounds of one of the largest former German concentration camps. This camp was also used by the Russian KGB during 1945 and 1950 as a “silencing camp”.\nI also suggest jumping on a boat tour. Berlin has five times as many bridges as Venice, with a large network of canals, rivers and lakes.\nVisit Berlin also features many sightseeing tours to other attractions in and around the city including the Brandenburg Gate and Check Point Charlie.\nGrab a Berlin Welcome Card from the tourism office too. This card provides free public transport, discounts to attractions, information and guide books. The five-day card is about $50. For a night-time activity, consider the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, one of the top three in the world. If you book now you may be able to secure tickets.\n Sagrada Familia Temple in Barcelona.

We have taken the opportunity to stay an additional four nights. How can we best take advantage of our stay, including sightseeing tours?\nDoc: A good way to acquaint yourself with the city is to jump on the Hop-on Hop-off sightseeing bus. It has three different routes to explore highlighting the key sights and attractions and will help you get your bearings.\nYou could spend a day wandering the winding streets in the old city, known as the Gothic Quarter. Many buildings here date back to medieval times and are World Heritage sites.\nInclude the unfinished La Sagrada Familia cathedral, which has been under construction since 1882, and the Picasso Museum.\nFor a day trip outside the city, take a train to the old town of Girona for cobblestone streets and a grand cathedral; Figueres to visit the Dali Museum, or Montserrat to take a cable car up the mountain to the monastery.\nEdited by Kim Culyer.
