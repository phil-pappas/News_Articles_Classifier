(AP photo) - + Nepal projects 40% drop in tourist arrivals KATHMANDU â€” Nepal reopened its most popular trekking trail to tourists on Thursday after international experts said it was safe, three months after two devastating earthquakes led the government to close most hiking routes. \nMiyamoto International, a California-based structural engineering company, said in a report that quake-related damage in the Annapurna region \"was very limited\". \nLess than 1% of the route and 3% of guest houses along the Annapurna circuit were damaged, it said, adding the report for the Everest region would be completed shortly. \nNepal had asked the company to assess the safety of its most popular tourist trekking trails, including in the Everest region, after the twin earthquakes killed almost 9,000 people and shook mountains triggering avalanches. \nAmong the victims were scores of climbers and guides. \nHowever, mountaineering and trekking operators said that the study was done in haste, covering a huge area and without consulting anyone in the business. \n\"The assessment should have been more detailed taking much longer time, because it covers such important safety issue,'' said Keshav Pandey of the Trekking Agencies' Association of Nepal. \nPandey said the study should have coordinated with the trekking operators who have good knowledge and experience of the area. \nThe Annapurna and the Everest region receive more than 140,000 hikers, or 70% of all climbers and trekkers who visit Nepal each year. \nThe 240-km Annapurna circuit takes almost three weeks to complete. It is dubbed the \"apple pie\" circuit because teahouses line the route offering cold beer and home baking. \nGovernment officials say tourists arrivals may decline by about 40% in 2015 because of safety concerns. \nThe Himalayan nation is one of the poorest in the world and many people depend on tourism for their income. \nClimbing on Mount Everest is closed for the second season in a row after Sherpas refused to rebuild broken paths across a deadly glacier after the earthquake struck. \nThe Langtang valley, Nepal's third most popular trekking destination, remains closed after the first quake in April triggered a catastrophic landslide.
