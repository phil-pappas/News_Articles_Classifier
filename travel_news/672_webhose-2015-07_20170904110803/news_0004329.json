Without Four Seasons in the mix, June's occupancy was at 91.9 percent, a record-breaker either way. \"This incredible June enabled Center City's year-to-date occupancy ... to surpass the 2014 year-to-date occupancy of 75.2 percent, thus finally overcoming the year’s soft start in January,\" Tyson said. Center City's year-to-date occupancy this year was at 76.2 percent with the now shuttered Four Seasons and 76.5 percent in actuality, he said. June's average daily hotel room rate, or ADR, was $212.95 — again, the highest since 1993 — bringing the year-to-date ADR up to $182.86, up nearly 7 percent year over year. Revenue per available room, or revPAR, was $190 for June, 10.7 percent higher than any other month since last October. June being a strong convention month was one of the factors that led to the occupancy numbers. Philadelphia was host to three citywide convention groups: Government Finance Officers Association, the Biotechnology Industrial Organization and the International Society for Technology in Education. The conventions booked by the Philadelphia Convention & Visitors Bureau consumed 97,208 room nights last month, or 32 percent of all demand for hotel room nights, according to the organization. The groups generated an estimated economic impact of more than $121 million for the region. \"We consistently tout to our convention groups how easily accessible Philadelphia is for their attendees,\" said Jack Ferguson, president and CEO of the PHLCVB, \"and with all the national and international buzz about Philadelphia, conventions are drawing higher than average attendance.\" Philadelphia is made up of three main segments: Leisure, business and group. The leisure and business segments are still being calculated but have provided strong returns in the past. \nWant Philadelphia Travel news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
