Bags and suitcases are typically forced open if travelers use non-TSA Approved locks. With TSA Accepted /Travel Sentry approved locks from Ody Travel Gear™, broken locks are a thing of the past.\nKnown by its distinctive red diamond logo, each lock has a special key, which is carefully distributed to the authorities and used by the TSA, CATSA, and other security agencies, to open and close the locks without damage.\nThese premium quality keyless locks are made with a tough and elegant zinc outer coating with a flexible, strong steel cable with a \"U\" clasp, and a 3-digit number combination for easy access. Travelers' luggage can now follow them safely to their destination, and individuals will have peace of mind knowing their lock is keeping their bags safe.\nOdy Travel Gear™ takes pride in putting their focus on customer service and hopes each customer will enjoy their products for years to come. If at any time a customer is not satisfied with any part of their business, the company is keen to hear from them.\nAvailable online from $21.95 and for a limited time, Ody Travel Gear ™ have included two eye catching Exclusive Luggage Labels with each twin pack lock purchase.\nAbout Ody Travel Gear\nOdy Travel Gear™ provides quality travel items for discerning travelers.
