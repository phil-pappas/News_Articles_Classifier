I’m constantly yearning to inject some East London into the West, and my appetite for the East is echoed in everything I do. For instance, I was looking for a new office, and the agent would repeatedly try to explain that the only spaces that would fit my criteria would be found in the East. Similarly, an architect recently exclaimed that my efforts to transform a Victorian house into an East London house were perhaps too ambitious and that I should simply consider relocating to the East. If only. There’s my kids’ school to consider. And because of my husband’s work, habits, and preferences, he somehow always convinces me that staying put in the South West works best for our family. And so…I stay and try to repress my desire to live in the East.\nThe East is like the New York of London: hip, vibrant, colorful, edgy, and creative. It goes without saying that I’m completely besotted with the street art that adorns the thick brick walls of the city. In fact, I now completely believe in love at first sight, as I couldn’t part ways with this whimsical\nred-and-white-striped house that a tenant had painted to anger her neighbors after they refused to let her dig a super-basement. That would have definitely failed to anger me—I would have loved to be her neighbor! If I were mayor of London for the day, I would add some stripes and colors to the safe decor of the South West…Boris Johnson, take note!\nPhoto: Mira Mikati\nThankfully, to feed the craving in me, a few trendy places opened in West London that added a retro-cool vibe to the area. First there was Pizza East, located on the corner of Portobello and Golborne roads, which became my secret Sunday brunch spot for a while. The restaurant’s exposed brickwork, vintage furniture, and distressed paneling made me feel like I was in the heart of Shoreditch, but I was just 12 minutes away from my house. How heavenly!\nRecently, the effortlessly hip West Thirty-Six opened in the same area. Here, you can go for drinks, brunch, lunch, and dinner—on a sunny day you can sit on the terrace, or you can stay in one of the many themed rooms and rest on the comfy leather Chesterfield sofas. This town house offers the perfect mix of intimacy and fun; it’s simultaneously cozy and appealing. The rooms give you the impression of dining at a friend’s house with a private butler for the night.\nFinally, it seems like my dream of the East meeting the West is coming to fruition. If you ever hear of a woman getting arrested for painting the walls of South West London all kinds of colors…it might just be me.\nWatch out, London!\nPhoto: Mira Mikati", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php"], "published": "2015-07-04T02:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T22:25:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
