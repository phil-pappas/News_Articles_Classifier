They’re being rolled out free to everyone in Britain. Why? Because a third of consumers do not currently understand their energy bills. It’s hard to work out if you’re overpaying, what tariff you’re on, and whether you could be on a better one. Smart meters will change this. They let you keep an eye on your expenditure. The information is also sent automatically to your energy supplier, who can send you more accurate bills. You only pay for what you use. No more letting strangers in to read the meter. See costs at a glance All smart meters have a display screen that allows you to monitor how much gas and electricity you have used over the last hour, day, month or year. It also shows exactly what it costs in pounds and pence. By the end of 2020, around 50 million smart meters will be fitted in more than 26 million households across England, Scotland and Wales Because the energy is monitored in real time, you can see how much energy is used when you turn your kettle on or do your laundry. A traffic-light system also helps you monitor whether you’re using more energy than you expect, or whether your usage is as efficient as it could be. This real-time information will not just change how you think about your energy use. It also lets you keep an eye on your energy provider’s prices. The smart meter automatically updates if you change suppliers, or tariffs. Free installation While there are some energy monitors available to buy in shops, obtaining a smart meter will not cost you anything. Your energy supplier will provide it and fit it for you. This is already being rolled out across the UK, as part of the government’s plans to bring Britain’s energy system up to date. The project will be in full swing by 2016 but it is already underway. At the beginning of 2015, there were just under one million early-generation smart meters up and running in homes. By the end of 2020, around 50 million smart meters will be fitted in more than 26 million households across England, Scotland and Wales. Because your smart meter is accurate and calibrated to the energy company, your bill will be accurate. You will only pay for the energy you use, no more estimated bills. Householders will finally be able to confidently budget for their energy costs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T14:55:37.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
