Star all-rounder Ben Stokes lived in New Zealand until the age of 12, although a decade of living in the north of England has ensured he sounds more Newcastle than New Plymouth.\nThis is all before taking a look at England’s limited-overs sides. The one-day team is captained by Irishman Eoin Morgan, and in recent years has featured the likes of South African-born players Jade Dernbach, Jason Roy and Michael Lumb.\nMeanwhile fringe national team member Chris Jordan grew up in Barbados and once shared a classroom with music superstar Rihanna.\nOriginally published as England’s African era comes to an end", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/29/1227461/703617-8e0d8cf4-35a3-11e5-b520-2768cb446c97.jpg", "http://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/the-ashes/ashes-2015-gary-ballance-axing-means-no-more-african-born-players-in-england-side/story-e6frf3gl-1227461703643", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/29/1227461/703589-aa32b26a-35a3-11e5-b520-2768cb446c97.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-29T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T07:43:59.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
