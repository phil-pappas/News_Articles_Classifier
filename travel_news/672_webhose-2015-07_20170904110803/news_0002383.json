The opening of a Marriott Hotel in Makkah is part of our commitment to fill a growing gap in the religious tourism sector in the region, which experts estimate will exponentially increase as the population of the Islamic faith grows. We are privileged to have opened our first-ever Marriott Hotel in this Holy City to serve millions of global pilgrims over the years to come,” said Alex Kyriakidis, president, Middle East & Africa of Marriott International. \nThe annual pilgrimage of Hajj and Umrah, a tradition that Muslims from all over the world need to fulfill at least once in their lifetime, sees millions of Muslims from across the globe converge in the Holy City. \nThe Saudi Commission for Tourism and Antiquities (SCTA) forecasts that domestic tourism will grow to a128 million trips and 640 million nights by 2019. \nMarriott International began its first operations in the Middle East region with the opening of the 411-room Riyadh Marriott Hotel in Saudi Arabia in 1980. \nThe company has set its sights on further strengthening its presence in the country with 19 new Saudi properties in the project pipeline. \nSignature features at the newly opened property include the Greatroom lobby and mobile check-in and check-out facility. \nThe reimagined Greatroom is part of Marriott Hotels brand initiative to transform lobbies from a formal living room into a local destination where guests spend time, by themselves or with people that matter, to relax and socialise.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T08:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T11:35:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
