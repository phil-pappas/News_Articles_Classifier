We are group of 3 planing ladakh trip in the month of August this year. Yes we are indeed 3 idiots in view of the fact that we were planning this trip since around 5 years but any how it didn't worked out. This time we are desperate to make it happen. Flights are already booked and we got a tentative itinerary on the basis of information gathered from this Amazing Forum =D>, Please advice your valuable inputs and suggestions. We will be traveling by hired taxi during all our trip. Please have a look and advise us - Day 1 (15th Aug) - Flight to Srinagar, arrival at 1:30pm. By 4pm start for Kargil.

Day 5 (19th Aug) - Leh to Pangong Lake (En route visit Thicksey Monastery, Hemis & Shey Monastary while reaching) Query: Is it possible to get accommodation at any of the camps nearby lake on spot? Or we need to book in advance via travel websites i.e. goibibo/yatra? Day 6 (20th Aug) - Pangong Lake to Tso Moriri Query: Can we directly leave for Tso moriri from Pangong Lake (in taxi) or we can en route to leh and then turn back to Tso Moriri from Hemis?

Please give your suggestions in finalizing this itinerary. 2. What will be approx taxi fare for this complete trip if we hire taxi from Srinagar till it drops us at Manali? 3. Please give taxi drivers numbers if you have any. Further, is it good to booked taxi on call in advance for this complete trip or we can hire on spot after landing in Srinagar? Also I read somewhere that taxi drivers from Srinagar cannot stop for sightseeing in leh/ladakh, is it true? 4. Is the climate will be really cold at Pangong? 5. Please advise budget hotel in Leh. 5. Any other suggestions, please advise as this will be our first trip.
