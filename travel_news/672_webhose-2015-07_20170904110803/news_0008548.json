It can cause severe brain damage and is fatal in 50 per cent of cases if untreated. Several different bacteria can cause meningitis. Geographic distribution and epidemic potential differ according to the sub-types. \nDr. William Perea, WHO's Coordinator for Control of Epidemic Diseases Unit, said “meningitis tends to hit Africa in cycles. Cases of meningitis C have been rising since 2013, first in Nigeria in 2013 and 2014, and then in Niger in 2015.” \n“We have to be ready for a much larger number of cases during the 2016 meningitis season,” Dr. Perea said. \nThe four organizations stressed that vaccination remains key to preventing meningitis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T20:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T22:30:52.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
