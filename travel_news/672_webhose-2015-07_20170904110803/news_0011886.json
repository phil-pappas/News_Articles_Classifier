Mark Rolfe, European Performance Management Specialist at IBM, believes business finance teams could become similarly indispensable by delivering timely, proactive insight to operational managers... Wimbledon offers a chance for sports fans to switch off from the day job, though perhaps not if you’re a finance manager. As the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) surpasses itself with yet more in-depth analysis of play this year, the insight relayed to spectators in real time is something finance chiefs dream of being able to match at work. Each year some 3.2 million data points are captured and input into the Wimbledon Information System The parallels between performance analytics at Wimbledon and performance analytics in business are more than a passing coincidence: there is no reason why companies couldn’t replicate the AELTC’s live, context-rich dissections. Indeed the world of sport gives an interesting insight into what’s possible when large amounts of raw data can be mined on demand and proactively pushed out to the business as decision-supporting insight. The challenges facing the organisers of Wimbledon aren’t dissimilar to those facing a lot of businesses. The AELTC is a modest-sized organisation which, for most of the year, gets by without any real need to process big data. But as June approaches and the world’s media are setting up their cameras, it has to suddenly ramp up its capabilities. Thanks to on-demand analytics, that’s become increasingly easy. Thanks to a technology partnership with IBM that dates back 26 years, the AELTC has amassed a wealth of rich performance data which current play can be compared against at very high speed. Each year some 3.2 million data points are captured and input into the Wimbledon Information System from the 19 Championship tennis courts. As raw data this has limited value; the challenge is to turn it into something meaningful that the AELTC can use to deliver the world-class event experience that fans worldwide expect. Although Wimbledon is closely covered by the world’s media, the AELTC prides itself on being the primary and best source of match insight throughout the tournament, to maximise fan engagement and maintain Wimbledon’s reputation as the world’s no 1 tennis event. That means answering the questions fans might ask before they’ve had chance to ask them. In other words, it is about telling the fuller story – by pre-empting users’ needs, putting the information they need in context, and serving it up to them in the moment. So, rather than merely alerting fans to the fact that Novak Djokovic has just recorded a milestone speed of serve, it’s providing the wraparound information – whose record he has just beaten, how that performance compares to his recent average, and to the speeds Murray was serving at when he took the title in 2013. Chief finance officers could use similar technology to give managers more insight Among the technologies enabling all of this are IBM InfoSphere Streams and Watson Engagement Advisor, through which popular success parameters can be used to ask the right questions and push key breaking match facts to the Wimbledon digital team rapidly and in context. In a business setting, chief finance officers could use similar technology to give departmental managers more of the insight they need to make on-the-fly business decisions. So if a promotion has been launched across two retail stores in the same city, and there is a disparity in their performance, the promotion team can work with the underperforming store to understand what the problem is while there is still an opportunity to turn sales around. Finance managers long to be able to deliver this kind of timely business insight, but often have been held back by an inability to consolidate and analyse data at speed and in context. That needn’t be the case. Wimbledon’s real-time insight is possible partly because the technology is provisioned through the cloud, where it is easy to access the required computing capacity on demand. That facility is open to all businesses through Watson Analytics – a cloud-based data analytics capability from IBM which puts rapid insight directly into the hands of business decision-makers. It is readily available to anyone to use (without need for an IT expert). Better still, it can take data directly from spreadsheets, and in any combination, and turn this into actionable insight for the business. Analytics in action at Wimbledon: • Wimbledon’s data set, which goes back to 1877, can be combined with live data allowing the AELTC’s digital team to deliver detailed insights to the people who crave them – wherever they are • Key achievements are proactively pushed out as web and social media alerts, keeping AELTC’s digital team ahead of fans’ needs As told to Sue Tabbitt Do you have the speed and accuracy to make the team?
