A few excellent flat whites at the city's cafes and a cocktail or two at a Cuba St bar; perhaps a visit to the Beehive and Parliament. Or they could ditch all that and, as I did, devote an entire weekend to the country's finest craft beer. Because in terms of beer-related fun, Wellington seriously has it sorted. \nGarage Project, the Aro St microbrewery housed in a former petrol station, is an apt place to kick off my beery weekend. Even though it's been going only since 2011, Garage Project is Wellington craft beer. Why? It has just the right amount of not-trying-too-hard coolness (wittily named beers, awesome labels, excellent beards) combined with – most importantly –consistently really, really, really good beer. Joining me is Beth Brash, the manager of Beervana, New Zealand's biggest and best-known beer festival, this year being held at Westpac Stadium on August 14-15. Brash came on board a couple of months ago after the festival was sold to the Wellington Culinary Events Trust, which owns Wellington on a Plate, the two-week culinary celebration of which Beervana is the centrepiece. Brothers Pete and Ian Gillespie, who co-founded Garage Project with their friend Jos Ruffell, give us a quick tour of the brewery and then the sampling begins at the cellar door, where anyone try some beers and take home a flagon or two. Craig Simcox \nCo-owner Matt Stevens at ParrotDog's Vivian St brewery. \nSoon GP fans will be able to have a pint of Garage Project's finest at the new bar, the Garage Project Aro Street Taproom, being set up across the road. \nThere are no spittoons involved in beer tasting – you need to taste it at the back of your palate, or something – which is fine by me. \nFirst we try a feijoa-infused version of saison beer Tournesol, then move on to the farmhouse-style Mon P'tit Chou, the Orange Sunshine wheat ale, the Baltic Porter and the \"Indochine pale ale\" Death from Above, to name but a few. Phew. Thankfully, sustenance has been provided in the form of scones dropped in by an appreciative cellar door customer. That sums up the Wellington beer scene, really – everyone's just so darn nice to each other. We chat with Pete Gillespie about what Garage Project has in store for Beervana this year. At last year's event, GP's stand was a hit, with the safety-goggle-clad team churning out Two-Pot Flat Whites – a shot of imperial coffee stout topped with a cream ale charged with nitrogen (hence the goggles) and poured from a barista's milk jug. High novelty factor, plus it was pretty much the best thing I've ever tasted. Gillespie is coy about what's in the works for this year, but promises a raft of new beers and a stand built by the guy who does sets for the Royal New Zealand Ballet. \"We're working on a few extra pieces to ramp things up,\" he says. \"It's nice to keep things exciting.\" Brash is keen to instil a Garage Project-like attitude in other brewers who appear at Beervana, so there are more interactive stands and fewer that offer not much more than the same beers you could buy at the liquor store. She also promises there will be more heating – last year was COLD – and more seating this year. Come 2016, expect big changes – including a new, as yet undecided venue (the annual event has been held in the rather charmless Westpac Stadium concourse since 2011). But back to this year. \nSome of what's on offer at Fork & Brewer. \nNext we head to ParrotDog brewery in Vivian St, set up in 2011-12 by three home-brewing enthusiasts named Matt. \nThe three Matts have done very well for themselves since then, earning all sorts of gongs including the champion small international brewery nod at the Australian Beer Awards this year. \nParrotDog's Beervana stand will be centred around RareBird, its series of five one-off beers dedicated to the fine avian species of Aotearoa, contained in special 650ml bottles with beautifully illustrated labels. They're working with conservationists to share the stories of \"the strange characters in our endemic birdlife\". See what I mean about the Wellington beer community being a bunch of nice folk? The Matts are reluctant to give away too much about their Beervana plans but the one who shows us around the brewery (Matt Stevens) promises it won't feature any real birds – apparently one year they took a parrot along and it soon became clear this was not a good idea. Stevens gives us a taste of the delightfully pink and seriously delicious Puffinus Huttoni, the second in the RareBird series (they're staggering the release of the five), which is dedicated to the eponymous seabird also known as the Hutton's shearwater. It's a boysenberry sour ale, which may sound odd, but trust me on this one – it's good. Sour ales are kind of a big deal right now in the brewing world. At Fork & Brewer on Bond St, Kelly Ryan, the brew pub's highly regarded head brewer, gives us a taste of the Yoghurt & Bruseli, a beer soured with lactobacillus, the bacteria used to make yoghurt. If you struggle with sour beers, don't think of them as beers, he says – imagine you're drinking a tart cider or perhaps a zingy sauvignon blanc. I do and it works – it's delicious and I find myself wanting more. So if you want to be a cutting-edge craft-beer connoisseur, perhaps it's time to branch out from that assertively hopped IPA and grab a sour ale. Our changing taste in beer is the topic of conversation at Tuatara's The Third Eye microbrewery and bar, where knowledgeable Tuatara co-founder Fraser McInnes takes us through a brief history of the wonderful substance, from the beer-loving Mesopotamians and Egyptians to the first NZ draught beer, made for sculling at the six o'clock swill. \nBeer drinkers soak up the sun outside Rogue and Vagabond. \nIt's all part of an informative tasting experience. Ad Feedback \nThough The Third Eye opened only this year, Tuatara's practically the granddaddy of the Wellington craft beer scene, turning 15 this year. \nTo mark the milestone, at Beervana they'll be launching a range of brews inspired by quintessential Kiwi celebrations – one will be an apres-ski beer with mandarin and spices. If the weather's anything like it was last year, it's bound to go down a treat. Kevin Stent \nOwner Dominic Kelly at Hashigo Zake. \nIf Tuatara's the granddaddy, Funk Estate must be the toddler of the Wellington craft beer scene. Set up by three mates, Shigeo (Shiggy) Takago, Jordan Evison and Dylan Shearer, three years ago, Funk Estate doesn't have its own brewery yet, using other breweries – currently Tuatara – to produce its small range of \"seriously funky brews\" with names like Super Afro-disiac, Oh Lordy and So'phisticuffs. \nI meet Takago at Rogue and Vagabond just off Cuba St, one of a handful of excellent inner-city spots that makes the capital ideally placed for craft-beer-bar crawling. \nRogue and Vagabond has live music and a park out front where beer drinkers can sprawl on bean bags during warmer weather. \nGolding's Free Dive craft beer bar in Wellington. \nTakago's passion for craft was sparked when he started working at another one of Welly's excellent craft beer bars, Hashigo Zake on Taranaki St. \nThis subterranean spot has a seriously impressive range of brews and a great atmosphere – it's easy to while away a few hours here without realising where the time went. \nThe same could be said for the very cosy Little Beer Quarter (LBQ) on Edward St, where I warmed my frozen extremities the night before Beervana last year. \nAnd then there's Golding's Free Dive. I don't want to play favourites, but, well, Golding's has a special place in my heart. Crammed with quirky paraphernalia from floor to ceiling (think vintage skis, bucket lamp shades, plastic goldfish), it's an ideal spot for a cracking game of I Spy. \nMy recent visit coincided with the Pints for Pooches fundraising day for the SPCA, a collaboration with Garage Project, which brewed a special beer called Tummy Tickles (awww).
