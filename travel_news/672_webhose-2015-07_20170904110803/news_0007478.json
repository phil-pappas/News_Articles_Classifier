Source: Channel 7\nThe pair were happy enough seeing the rundown family home in Mount Druitt completely transformed into a modern pad.\nNow Steve is debt-free after having his mortgage wiped — a financial freedom he thought he’d never enjoy.\nThe 47-year-old tradesman bought the house more than two decades ago with his wife Danielle and they had big plans of raising a family within its four walls.\n“We had two beautiful kids,” Steve recalled. “Sadly, she passed away when she was 27 … she had pneumonia. It was really tough. My mum came to stay to help us get by … I had to work a lot to keep a roof over our heads. Then she got ill and passed away.\n“My kids are what got me through it all. I had to keep going for them — I couldn’t lose it, even if I felt like it sometimes.” Missed out ... Ben and Danielle Edgeworth got so close but just missed out on the win. Picture: Tara Croser. Source: News Corp Australia\nAnother happy outcome of the House Rules roller-coaster has been forging a stronger relationship with Tiana, he said.\nDespite many tough moments, including having to sleep in a tent for a couple of weeks, Tiana said she wouldn’t swap the experience for anything.\n“This has been the most amazing time ever,” Tiana said.\n“I’ve never laughed or cried so much in my life. Being in this competition has proven we can get through pretty much anything.”\nRunner up Ben, 32, praised his partner for her effort, saying they’d come out of the competition winners in other ways.\n“Danielle and I wondered whether we were ready to start a family but now after getting through this together, there’s no doubt in my mind we are ready,” he said.\nFor her part, Danielle, 31, said her beau was the reason she got through each challenge.\nThe winner was decided via a combination of judges’ scores and a public vote.\nOriginally published as Battlers win ultimate debt-free prize", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/20/1227449/961353-dfb580be-2ed9-11e5-a24e-db314d4219bf.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/20/1227449/901616-0e9a5a1a-2ea5-11e5-a265-b36c865c538e.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/father-and-daughter-battlers-win-the-ultimate-debt-free-prize/story-fn8yvfst-1227449901642"], "published": "2015-07-21T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T18:19:16.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
