I first visited in my 20s and got engaged there. We spent our honeymoon there. My wife and I have been back with our children, too. I love that it is this unique, labyrinthine city in the middle of the sea. Dating from the 10th century BC, it is steeped in history and culture. It was a maritime state, completely reliant on trade, and had one of the world’s most powerful navies at one point. That it is so fragile and is sinking adds to its mystique. You really don’t know for how much longer it will be around. \nAnything special I should pack? \nWellington boots as the city tends to get flooded, especially during the winter months. \nWhat do you miss most when you’re away? \nThe atmosphere and unique qualities that a dense metropolis in such a water-dominated environment has. I like to go in February or March, when there is an incredible light and atmospheric mist over the city, which seem to bounce off the Venetian Lagoon. \nThe Grand Canal, Venice (Fotolia/AP) \nWhat’s the first thing you do when you arrive? \nI normally go to St Mark’s Square, grab a coffee and have a think about what to do that day. I like just wandering around and getting lost in among all the little streets. I often visit the Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari (001 39 041 272 8611; basilicadeifrari.it ) , a beautiful old church that has a wealth of art, including fantastic works by Titian. \nWhere’s the best place to stay? \nThe Belmond Hotel Cipriani, (41 240 801; belmond.com ) , where I stayed for my honeymoon. It feels like it’s set in a time warp in the Fifties on Giudecca island, and is accessible by a boat from St Mark’s Square. It has beautiful rooms with fantastic views across the lagoon. \nWhere would you meet friends for a drink? \nHarry’s Bar, just off St Mark’s Square (41 528 5777; harrysbarvenezia.com ) . It is overpriced but is a must-see as it is steeped in history. All the waiters appear to have been there for years, which makes the place all the more authentic. The Bellini is the drink to have, but as I don’t drink I usually have the non-alcoholic beer. \nSt Mark’s Basilica in St Mark's Square (Fotolia/AP) \nWhere’s the best place for lunch? \nTrattoria Alla Madonna (41 522 3824; ristoranteallamadonna.com ) is a tried and trusted place that I have been to many times. It’s perfect for a bite to eat after a morning doing a lot of cultural activities. Quite often I just like looking for a new local trattoria to try out as well. \nAnd for dinner? \nAntica Locanda Montin (41 522 7151; locandamontin.com ) does great food. It is very Venetian and very romantic. \nGiudecca island (Fotolia/AP) \nWhere would you send a first- time visitor? \nThe Doge’s Palace (41 271 5911; palazzoducale.visitmuve.it ) and St Mark’s Basilica (41 270 8311; basilicasanmarco.it) in St Mark’s Square. The Peggy Guggenheim Collection (41 240 5411; guggenheim-venice.it ) is good if you like art. The Jewish quarter has an incredible history and is worth visiting, particularly for the Jewish Museum (41 715359; museoebraico.it ) . Churches like Scuola Grande di San Rocco (41 523 4864; scuolagrandesanrocco.it ) , which is known for its paintings by Tintoretto, are worth a visit. So many churches in the city have amazing art on view. Taking a boat down the Grand Canal is a must. Murano, a series of islands just a little way into the lagoon, is famous for its glass-blowing work and well worth a trip to see. \nWhat should I avoid? \nGoing in the height of summer. It is just too hot and full of tourists. And avoid having a plan – I think it is best to be spontaneous and discover the place, rather than have a set itinerary. \nPublic transport or taxi? \nThe waterbuses are fine, but as the city is so small, that is your only option. It isn’t the most child-friendly of places. You have to lift prams up and over the bridges, but that shouldn’t put anyone off from going. \nThe Doge's Palace and St Mark's Campanile (Fotolia/AP) \nManbag or moneybelt? \nIt is a very safe city. I have never personally experienced or seen any crime there and I don’t know anyone who has. \nWhat should I bring home? \nSome Murano glass or Venetian masks. I’ve bought both, although I haven’t been to the city when the Venice Carnival ( venice-carnival-italy.com ) takes place, as I don’t enjoy crowds. But I’m sure it is worth attending. \nAnywhere that isn’t your kind of town? \nI don’t have one really. I always find something pleasant or a good experience wherever I go. \nBlack Sails, starring Toby Stephens, begins on July 14 at 10pm on the History Channel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T21:34:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
