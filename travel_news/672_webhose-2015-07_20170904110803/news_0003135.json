People have been told to check in with the fast-track baggage system and the machines have no baggage tags in them.

It’s not just this year but last year we had trouble too. You couldn’t print the tickets. It’s absolutely ridiculous, especially when you have four children with you. \n“I have never been treated like this before in any other country. There is just no accountability. I’ve moved 10 yards in this queue in about 45 minutes. The staff themselves don’t know what is going on. They are hiding in their offices. \n“If I don’t get my flight they are going to have a riot on their hands. They treat cattle better than this.” STEVE REIGATE The self-service check-in machines reported It’s absolutely ridiculous, especially when you have four children with you Ivan Bull \nCatherine Hollands, 73, returning to Canada after a Baltic cruise, said: “I went to the self-service machine and it told me to seek assistance. I was ushered over here and now I have been waiting in this line for more than an hour.” \nAnother passenger, Afzal Kiani, 54, said: “It printed out the boarding passes but not the baggage tag. Somebody should have been there to help.” \nHeather Fenton, 65, travelling back to Australia after visiting Europe, said: “This is the worst airport I have been in for a long time and I have been travelling since 1970.” \nA check-in assistant at Heathrow, who did not wish to be named, said: “I think it’s because it is so busy today. It is not normally like this. There have been a lot of angry people.” \nA spokeswoman for Heathrow denied that its machines had run out of paper, adding: “It’s been slightly busier than normal because of the school holidays.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T07:30:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
