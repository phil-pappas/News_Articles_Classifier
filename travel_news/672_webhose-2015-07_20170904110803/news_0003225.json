What crisis? Summer holiday bookings to Greece are up on last year, tour operators say, with plenty of bargains to be had koufonissi Photo: Municipality of Naxos and the Smaller Cyclades Comments \nTour operators are rejoicing in the face of the Greek economic crisis as bookings for the summer pick up and a raft of exceptional deals look set to bring a smile to holidaymakers' faces. \nUncertainty about Greece’s place in Europe and the protracted wrangling over a bailout package have not prevented a surge in holidaymakers wanting to visit Greece . \nPerhaps it is the prospect of the perennially popular destination becoming more affordable, but Trivago said it has seen searches for Greek hotels shoot up by more than a quarter compared to last year. \nThe hotel comparison website told Telegraph Travel that interest in Greece is up by 27 per cent compared to 2014 and by 8 per cent on last month. \nThis interest has translated into sales, with the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) confirming that bookings to Greece remain healthy and are up year on year, with travellers taking advantage of “some exceptional deals”. \nAn Abta spokesman said travel agents are reporting an increase in late bookings following the recent bailout agreement. He added that travellers will find “business as usual on the Greek islands, with hotels, bars and restaurants operating as normal”. \nIn June, when stories about a migrant influx to islands such as Kos coincided with a drop in interest in the South Aegean and Ionian islands, Crete seemed to be one of the main beneficiaries, Trivago said, experiencing a surge in accommodation searches. \nHolidaymakers are returning this month however, with searches to the South Aegean now accounting for 37 per cent of all searches to Greece - 2 per cent more than last month. Searches to the Ionian Islands now account for 25 per cent of all searches, it said, 3 per cent on last month. \nChris Wright, managing director of tour operator Sunvil, said that, although bookings to Greece were ahead at the start of the year, from February onwards they slowed. \n“Last week, following the announcement of a potential deal, confidence in travel to Greece has improved,” he said, “and - with the reopening of banks on Monday - we have seen another bounce in confidence.” \nHe added that holidaymakers were still very keen to travel to Greece. \nThomas Cook said its bookings had also been strong, with less left to sell in the ‘lates’ period compared to the same period last year. However, it said it still has “some amazing deals” for customers who haven’t yet booked. \nBooking.com had more evidence of a bounce back on its website. A devastating drop in the number of Greek rooms reserved between June 17 - when the Greek central bank warned that the country could be thrown out of the EU - and July 17, has been followed in recent days by an increase in reservations above and beyond the number made last year. \nOverall, Booking.com said that global bookings to Greece had increased by 41 per cent in the first half of 2015 when compared to the same period last year. \nDeals currently available for those wanting to spend part of their summer in Greece include a saving of more than £500 on a villa holiday in Skopelos, £600 off a hotel stay for a family of four in Corfu and reductions of around 30 per cent on selected Greek island hotels through Booking.com. \nThe Foreign Office is still advising holidaymakers to take sufficient euros to cover all of their expenses while in Greece, however, with banks providing only limited services. \nFor the latest travel advice see gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/Greece .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T19:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T20:38:30.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
