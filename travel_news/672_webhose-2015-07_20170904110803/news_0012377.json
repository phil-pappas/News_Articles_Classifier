The Commission’s report makes clear that expansion at Gatwick is deliverable,” said chief executive Stewart Wingate. \n“It is for the Commission to make a recommendation but it is of course for the Government to decide. So we now enter the most important stage of the process.” \nAlthough the commission backed Heathrow it has left the door open for Gatwick by saying that the scheme is “feasible”. \nThe commission said the Heathrow north-west option presented “the strongest case and [offered] the greatest strategic and economic benefits”. \nThe independent Heathrow Hub group proposed the third shortlisted option. \nCaptain William “Jock” Lowe and his fellow directors of Heathrow Hub, said: “Heathrow airport is the correct location for expansion for the UK. Our economy, our national transport infrastructure and our international connectivity will be vastly improved by the expansion of Heathrow airport. \n“While we obviously still believe our own concept to extend the runways is superior to Heathrow Airport Ltd.’s third runway option, we congratulate John Holland-Kaye and his team.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T13:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T10:17:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
