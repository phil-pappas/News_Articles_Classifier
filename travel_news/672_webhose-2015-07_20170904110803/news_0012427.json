While we found great success in meeting market needs with separate meetings and group travel organisations, the new configuration positions us better for future growth and scalability. \n\n“The meetings and events business is booming around the world, and our shareholder is committed to seeking out investment opportunities in the meetings and events space. The new brand positions us for growth,” Graf commented.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T17:18:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
