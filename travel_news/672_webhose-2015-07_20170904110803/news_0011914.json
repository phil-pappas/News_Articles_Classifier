Now, the role played by rangers in helping to protect rare and coveted creatures has been saluted with a new award created by the Duke of Cambridge to recognise those who labour tirelessly on the conservation front-line. Today - World Ranger Day – saw the inaugural Tusk Wildlife Ranger Award handed to Edward Ndiritu, who works for the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in northern Kenya. The duke honoured the hard work of rangers to curb poaching in a week when game hunting became a global talking point following the killing of Cecil, a collared Zimbabwean lion who was shot with a bow and arrow by an American dentist . Prince William saluted Ndiritu in a letter of congratulation that described the honour as “richly deserved” – and praised him for “the extraordinary contribution you and your team at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy have made towards the protection of wildlife and increased security for the rural communities of northern Kenya.” Ndiritu is employed as head of the Anti-Poaching Unit and the Northern Rangelands Trust – a safeguarded space that spreads out across 55,000 acres of savannah, wetland and forest, 150 miles north of the capital Nairobi. Lewa rangers at the prize giving On receiving the letter from the duke, Ndiritu said: \"I would like to accept this award on behalf of my whole team. I recognise that it is not just my efforts that have made a difference – we have achieved this success thanks to the entire team's dedication and hard work. I am thankful for everyone’s support and greatly humbled by this recognition. Thank you.\" Mike Watson, Lewa's CEO, said: “Leadership, commitment, integrity and a fierce sense of fairness are what stand out in Edward’s character on a daily basis. I am delighted that Edward has been recognised for the massive contribution he has made to Lewa and northern Kenya’s conservation and community livelihood development efforts. We are extremely proud that he is the first recipient of this prestigious award.” Lewa's wildlife conservancy can claim a grand array of inhabitants – not least as regular host to the 9,500 migratory elephants that move across the vast landscape of northern Kenya. It also shelters an animal whose existence is under threat – the rhinoceros. Lewa is home to 72 black and 66 white rhino – 13 per cent of Kenya’s rhino population. A rhino tusk recovered by Lewa's security team Ndiritu’s award is partly in tribute to the fact that, in 2014, Lewa was the only Kenyan conservancy not to see a rhino killed by poachers. Ever in demand with black-market hunters – largely because rhinoceros horn is seen as having beneficial properties in Oriental medicine – the animal has suffered hugely in the last half-century. Africa’s black rhino population hovered at 70,000 at the end of the Sixties, but had plunged to just 2,475 by 1993. It has since recovered slightly, and had reached a headcount of 4,880 by 2010. The conservancy system is at the forefront of the battle to protect the continent’s prime species. This system involves the creation of a series of carefully controlled enclaves where conservation is paramount and tourist numbers are limited. Baby orphaned rhinos at Lewa Lewa was established in 1995 on a former cattle ranch. Its diverse ecosystem makes it home to lions, leopards, buffaloes and zebras, as well as rhinos and elephants. It made headlines in October 2010 when Prince William proposed to his then-girlfriend Kate Middleton, the future Duchess of Cambridge, while on holiday there . Ndiritu will visit London to receive his award – part of the annual Tusk Conservation Awards – in November. Charlie Mayhew, co-founder of Tusk – which has been active in wildlife protection in Africa since 1990 – also voiced his admiration. “Edward is an exceptional man whose professionalism and dedication have earned him huge respect – not only among his team, but across the wider conservation community in Kenya,” he says. “He is unquestionably the worthy winner of our first Tusk Wildlife Ranger Award.” Prince William honours Kenyan ranger with Tusk award for work in rhino protection Telegraphtravel Follow @telegraphtravel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T22:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T21:40:20.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
