Pent-up demand is also fuelling travel, as some had held back their plans to holiday last year due to Indonesia’s general election. \n\nNanda Kumar, managing director of Hidden Asia Travel & Tours, said he is anticipating a 10 per cent increase in business events travel to Malaysia this year, with five bookings already confirmed. \n\nHe expects a pick up in leisure family travel as well, with Genting, Kuala Lumpur and Legoland Malaysia in Johor Bahru being favourite destinations. \n\nArokia Das, senior manager, Luxury Tours Malaysia, said: “This year, post-Raya will definitely be stronger than last year. We expect leisure business to increase by at least 35 per cent year-on-year during the Lebaran holiday and MICE by at least 18 per cent post-Raya. \n\n“Cheap airfares, a growing middle class, and direct connectivity from major cities such as Jakarta, Medan and Surabaya are driving business.” \n\nKimberley Khoo, deputy inbound manager at Skyzone Tours & Travel, said she has a few confirmed incentive bookings in August and had received requests for proposals for September and October. \n\nBoth Khoo and Das said that Kuala Lumpur remains a key destination for MICE, followed by Johor Bahru twinned with Singapore.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T07:19:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
