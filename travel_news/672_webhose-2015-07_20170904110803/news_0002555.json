A task force led by Europe's aviation safety regulator, EASA, also called for the introduction of random drugs and alcohol testing of pilots and better oversight of the doctors responsible for their regular medical checks.\nEuropean Union Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc ordered the review after a young pilot barricaded himself inside the cockpit and crashed a Germanwings airliner into the Alps in March, killing all 150 people on board.\nProsecutors have found evidence that the co-pilot, who had suffered severe depression and may have feared losing his job, had researched suicide methods and concealed an illness from his employer, sparking a debate on supervision and medical privacy.\n\"We don't know everything that happened in this tragedy but we know a certain number of causes and we thought we may not want to wait until the final report of the accident investigation to launch actions,\" Patrick Ky, executive director of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said.\nThe idea is to \"minimise the risk of a similar tragedy in the future\", he said in an interview.\nAlongside the extra testing, the panel is proposing better support schemes to allow pilots to come forward with concerns about their health, careers or other problems and discuss them confidentially without \"an atmosphere of fear\".\nThat would go beyond the traditional regulations and may have alerted colleagues sooner to the condition of the Germanwings pilot. Unions say it would represent a marked change of culture for the toughly managed airline industry.\n\"If the aviation industry, through the work of this task force, can help de-stigmatise mental health issues and the way to deal with them and propose solutions beyond the reaches of the industry, it will have achieved more than the initial goal,\" said Paul Reuter, technical director of the European Cockpit Association and a member of the task force.\nCOCKPIT DOORS\nThe EASA task force -- drawn from airlines, flight crews, doctors and aviation authorities -- did not recommend changes to cockpit doors that were strengthened after the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States.\nBut it endorsed a recent EASA recommendation that there should always be two people in the cockpit.\nFrance's BEA air crash investigation agency has found that Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz took advantage of toilet breaks by the captain, both to rehearse the manoeuvre on the previous flight and then to carry out his plan to destroy the jet after locking the captain out on the return flight 9525.\nThe BEA is investigating separately whether cockpit door-locking systems should be changed and how to balance medical confidentiality and safety, a sensitive issue in nations such as France and Germany with a strong tradition of medical privacy.\nThe medical database proposed by EASA would initially only record the dates and places of specialist 'aero-medical' check-ups and whether a pilot had been deemed fit to fly.\nThat would not have helped in the case of Lubitz, who is suspected of concealing notes written by a general practitioner, but would prevent what Ky called \"medical tourism\" or going abroad to get a favourable certificate for a pilot license.\nEASA called for a deeper examination of medical secrecy in all 28 EU nations. Some such as Britain already advise doctors to report any concerns where public safety is at stake.\n\"We know this is going to be the most difficult topic in our recommendations, but we really believe that if nothing is done... then the risk is still high of having pilots who are medically unfit... continuing to be pilots,\" Ky said.\nGerman pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit said while it welcomed the recommendations on support schemes, random drug testing and any relaxation of Germany's strict doctor-patient confidentiality rules could be counter-productive.\n\"It's important for pilots not to want to hide problems because of the fear they will lose their jobs,\" spokesman Markus Wahl said.\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T20:03:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
