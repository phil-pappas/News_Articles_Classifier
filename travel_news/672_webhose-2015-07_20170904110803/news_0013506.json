Since Oregon voters enacted Measure 91 legalizing recreational marijuana, veteran growers and newbies have been gathering monthly for updates on the regulatory picture and to share tips on growing healthy happy cannabis plants. Though many are hoping a new era of legal cannabis will be an economic boom for Oregon, experts suggest for many it will be a bust. Measure 91 starts going into effect July 1, when people can possess and grow amounts for personal use. But retail sales are months or more than a year away.

A few police cars cruised by without stopping.\nLast fall, voters OK'd the private use of small amounts of pot for adults.\nBut state officials are still working out the details of legalization. Retail sales aren't expected until Oct. 1.\nOregon is the fourth state to green-light recreational marijuana.\nFederal statistics show slightly more than 12 per cent of Oregonians reporting recent marijuana use. That's nearly 5 percentage points above the national rate.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T22:06:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
