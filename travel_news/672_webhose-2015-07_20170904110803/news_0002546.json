If you are middle aged, you are simply middle aged, and no opprobrium attaches to that fact. But if you are old, you will be called be anything from \"elderly\", \"geriatric\", \"a pensioner\", \"a retiree\" or a \"senior\" to \"a granny\". At best, at very best, you can be \"wonderful for your age\". And you are not supposed to mind. Whichever words are used to describe age, they are derogatory or patronising , never respectful or admiring of the fact you have come so far. Now, speaking as one who has reached their threescore years and ten without feeling, looking or acting, remotely old , it has got to stop. Why can’t older people just be referred to by their age without some pejorative age-related epithet being added? When somebody is referred to as a pensioner, we immediately think of them as being pensioned-off, no longer of any use to anybody Liz Hodgkinson Whenever a news story appears about a 73 year-old, for instance, he or she is invariably referred to as \"elderly\". In fact, they are often called ‘elderly’ before you are even told their age. This means that instantly you, the reader, see that person as decrepit, as a horrible old has-been, shuffling round the supermarket buying incontinence pads, having a house full of mobility aids and shaking their fists at modern youth. We are lumped together by younger people as if we are all the same; a dreary undifferentiated mass of ghastly old biddies . I blame Shakespeare, of course. His uncompromisingly dismal depictions of old age have embedded themselves into the national, and international, consciousness for the past 400 years, so that we have come to see his verses about ‘\"crabbed age and youth\" almost as holy writ. The Bard has told us that youth is full of pleasance and age is full of care; that youth is like summer brave and age like winter bare. He finishes the poem by saying: \"Youth I do adore thee; Age, I do abhor thee!\" Over the centuries, we have internalised his words so that we too see old age as something to be feared and reviled. We also believe, again thanks to Shakespeare, that our seventh and final age is characterized by \"second childishness and mere oblivion, sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything\". Harold and Maude: Maude, 79, has to convince death obsessed Harold how fun life can be (Rex) But actually, he was wrong, for once. Or at least, he would be today. For nowadays it’s youth, rather than age, that is full of care. Recent research has shown that the happiest people are those in their early 70s , rather than the young. Very many young people are consumed with anxiety , they suffer from peer pressure, worry about exam results and constantly, about their appearance. At our age, we have come to accept what cannot be changed and nowadays we can have a wonderful time when we are older; far better than we ever managed when we were young. We have long shaken off all the cares and anxieties of youth and middle age and, given good health and enough money, we can have the time of our life going on wonderful holidays and generally pleasing ourselves. With age, can come confidence, courage and even, for some, a new lease of life with an exciting later-life relationship. Dickens did not do old people any favours, either. Just about all of his elderly characters are grotesques, feeble in mind and body. But then we have to remember that both of these great men died in their fifties, and were never able to write about old age from direct experience. If they had, they may not have found it so bad as they feared. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman go on an adventure in The Bucket List (Rex) So it is now up to us, those who have actually arrived at this stage of life, to redress the balance, to reject every ageist label that has been stuck on to us, and simply refuse to be written off as elderly or, with all that implies, pensioners. When somebody is referred to as a pensioner, we immediately think of them as being pensioned-off , no longer of any use to anybody, which may in reality be far from the case. But what I hate more than anything is being called a \"granny\". I am, rather, an intelligent, independent career woman who happens to have grandchildren. So just don’t use the term to describe me, thanks very much, or indeed any other word that defines me, negatively , by the number of years I have accumulated or the fact that my children have reproduced. People use the word \"granny\" or \"granddad\" to indicate somebody who is very old and decrepit, yet you can be a grandparent in your thirties. And as I say to my own grandchildren when they lapse into thinking of me as somebody extremely elderly, I’m just as young as you are, inside. The only difference, I tell them, is that because I have seen more of life, I am much more sensible. So perhaps we could relabel ourselves \"sensibles\", which would be nearer to the truth.
