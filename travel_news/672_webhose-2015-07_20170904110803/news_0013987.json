Credit Janie Osborne for The New York Times A Rookie’s Road Trip Through Montana, Wyoming and Idaho A car-averse traveler finds freedom in the driver’s seat, covering 700 miles and three states over three days. JUNE 30, 2015 Continue reading the main story If you long to answer the call of the open road but lack experience behind the wheel, look no further than the rental lot at Billings Logan International Airport in Montana . On this sleepy strip of pavement you can spend a leisurely half-hour trying to deactivate the electronic parking brake you unwittingly turned on; practice a few turns to help ensure you won’t deep-six anyone; and attempt to allay the rising trepidation of your fellow traveler. Then, perhaps you will do as I did: drive (the wrong way) into town for lunch at the Burger Dive, a 1950s-style diner with chrome-trim chairs, burgers with names like the “Outlaw” and tattooed employees who look as if they’d just stepped off the L train from Brooklyn. Thus, with a side of onion rings, began my all-American road trip, the one most romantics take when they’re 22 and there’s “nowhere to go but everywhere” as Sal Paradise put it in Jack Kerouac’s “On the Road.” I’ve had a driver’s license for years, but in New York City the miles I log are on foot. Besides, I had never understood people’s fascination with driving. A car, in my mind, was merely a means to move from here to there, a burden to its owner and the environment, and potentially a way to get hurt or do harm. Yet the remote, roughhewn beauty of the West has beckoned since I was a teenager. Who can say why you finally decide to do a thing? On a cool June morning, I slid into the driver’s seat. The plan was to travel from the peaks of the Beartooth Range in Montana, through Yellowstone in Wyoming, to Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve in Idaho, some 700 miles. In the rental lot I buckled myself into a white Subaru Legacy alongside my travel companion, Dan, an unflappable, natural teacher tasked with the job of keeping us alive. To that end, he would do most of the driving. I’d try my hand at it here and there, putting my cowboy boot to the pedal where the road was wide and empty, hoping to experience a flash of transcendence. On the Road in Big Sky Country On the Road in Big Sky Country Credit Janie Osborne for The New York Times My first drive of the trip, into downtown Billings, lasted seven minutes — nine if you count my initially going in the opposite direction. I moved gingerly, never feeling entirely in control, though we skated past a sheriff’s car and arrived at the Dive unscathed. After lunch we considered touring the turn-of-the-century Moss Mansion, perhaps refining our aim at Three Sights Indoor Shooting Range. But at Lou Taubert Ranch Outfitters — where cowboy boots come studded and stitched, made of reptile skins and ostrich leather — a salesman in a cowboy hat said, on hearing of our destination along Yellowstone Lake: “Some people take three days to get where you’re going.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story We planned to do it in an afternoon, driving about 200 miles from Billings through Beartooth Pass to Yellowstone, where we would spend the night at the Lake Yellowstone Hotel and Cabins, which has been around in one form or another since 1891. Cresting at nearly 11,000 feet amid the Beartooth Mountains, Beartooth Pass is among the most breathtaking and perilous stretches of road in the country. It can be shut down even in summer because of ice, falling rocks, mudslides, fires and avalanches. At the airport Hertz counter a woman had said that if we made it, we should get out of the car and write our names in snow on a mountainside, “because that’s what everybody does.” Everybody willing to drive Beartooth Pass, that is. I was not. But I’d try and get us to a nearby town where Dan could take over. “It’s a great time of day to go,” said the salesman at Lou Taubert as we set off. “Game come out in the evening.” Driving west from Billings, a gray road rises like the hump of a whale and you momentarily can’t see where it leads. As I approached, I thought about an old nightmare I used to have. I’d be in the back seat of a car and the highway would morph into an unfinished roller coaster track and the car would begin to fall. “Just look at the truck in front of you,” Dan said. “Focus on the truck.” I looked hard at the taillights and white-knuckled it toward nothingness. As the rest of the road came into view, the dread burned off like the morning fog. Billings was disappearing, its Ferris wheel shrinking in the rearview mirror. The Tractor & Equipment Company and the Walmart Supercenter off U.S. Route 212 gave way to grassy fields, muted in the afternoon light like a 19th-century Albert Bierstadt painting. A billboard asked: “Where are you going? Heaven or hell?” Dan talked of curves in the road, how to glide in slow, then accelerate inside the pocket. Mile by mile, town by town, I eased my death-grip on the wheel. I felt the road unrolling beneath me, and something else, too — a flutter of exuberance, like the scene in “Peter Pan” when the Darling children are learning to fly, though in my musical I was singing, “I’m driving!” Around 3:15 we pulled into Red Lodge: former coal boomtown, site of a bank robbery by the Sundance Kid, rest stop for Calamity Jane, and the last stretch of civilization before Beartooth Pass. “Hemingway drank here once,” said a blackboard on the sidewalk outside a bar, “at least we thought he did.” Inside the nearby Montana Candy Emporium, the walls were covered with vintage advertising signs for beer and Pepsi-Cola, which the young man at the register said the owner has been collecting for 40 years — apparently along with a stuffed ostrich and a bison head. Below are baskets and trays of sweets befitting Willy Wonka’s factory: chicken and waffle taffy, huckleberry (a favorite local ingredient) jelly fruit slices, and moose pies (potato chips, toffee and milk chocolate).

By the time I realized I was driving a steep road around the rim of a yawning canyon, I was too stunned — by the soaring mountains and the sheer absurdity that I was the one at the wheel — to voice alarm. Though I dared not look into the abyss. Eyes on the road, I pushed up, past evergreens and a waterfall that skidded down a mountain like a vein. During seven miles of switchbacks, one of us would, on occasion, burst into the refrain from “This Land Is Your Land,” or some other song generally reserved for campfires. No car radio. No iPhone. An untested driver needs no distraction. As it is, when I adjust my window I have a tendency to drift into the next lane. There is no next lane on Beartooth Pass. There is, however, the occasional turnout, including one overlooking glaciers and Custer National Forest. I parked on a stretch of dirt and followed Dan to the edge of a cliff. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “Listen,” he said. From below came the sound of rushing water. We stood in silence. The sky had drained of color. There were no other cars, no other people, though there was evidence of the latter. On the mountainside by the road, in a dirty patch of snow, were block letters: ALEX WAS HERE. I stuck my finger into a slightly less filthy spot and drew our initials. No sooner were we back in the car than a rock the size of a basketball tumbled to where I’d been writing. Time to move on. Beartooth Pass, part of Beartooth Highway, is, to borrow a phrase from the author Joseph Campbell, a “road of trials.” Along with stirring panoramas come signs warning of falling rocks, icy roads and hairpin turns to be taken at 20 miles an hour. At 9,190 feet, I pulled into Rock Creek Vista Point. “This is bear country!” said a sign in a restroom stall. “Be alert, make noise, carry bear spray and know how to use it.” Bear spray? I was still getting accustomed to carrying a car key. It had begun raining as I zigzagged down the wet mountain byway toward the words “Open Range. Expect Cows on the Road.” Why hadn’t I done this sort of drive before? It was kind of thrilling. \nAdvertisement “You may want to slow down, Mario Andretti,” said Dan. At 8:31 p.m. the sign we had been waiting for materialized: “Welcome to Yellowstone.” Nearly there!, I thought. The rain had moved out. The sky was purple, the clouds were pink, and on either side of us were big, woolly bison, as if we had driven into another time. Photo A welcome sign above the Million Dollar Cowboy Bar. Credit Janie Osborne for The New York Times It wasn’t long, however, before everything was dark. The muscles in my upper back had begun to burn. Dan leaned out his window and asked some hikers how much farther to Yellowstone Lake. I heard the words “hour and a half.” I was a bit deflated but certainly not quitting this late in the game. Dan cautioned that in sports, it’s often in the last game of the day that someone gets hurt because they are tired and lose concentration. I promised we wouldn’t be those players. “Please,” I said, though it was unnecessary. He understood: “This is your marathon.” I grinned. “Let’s drive!” “O.K.,” he replied, glancing at the gearshift. “But how about not in reverse?” The rain returned. So did the hairpin turns, leading us past a burned forest where trees looked like matchsticks. Whenever a car approached I switched off the brights, though in the process I would inadvertently switch on the turn signal. If I tried to shut it off, I ended up signaling in the other direction. Thus we drove through the woods, the Subaru blinking dumbly in the dark. I didn’t know that I cut it a little close on a couple of cliffs. It wasn’t until later that Dan debriefed me: “You only almost killed us once.” We arrived at Yellowstone Lake close to midnight, too late for a victory dinner. The hotel restaurants were closed. So we ate peanut butter chocolate fudge. And moose pie. And SunChips from a vending machine. I peered out the window of the room into blackness. “We have a view of the parking lot,” I said, and drew the curtains. When I parted them in the wee hours of the morning, the moon was still out. And there, beneath the windowsill, was Yellowstone Lake. In the night I had mistaken its placid surface for a parking lot. Transformation from lot to 20-mile-long lake is the sort of thing that happens only in dreams. Yet something even more magical happened overnight: I was looking forward to getting back behind the wheel. That morning driving felt less like an ambition and more, dare I say, like pleasure. Rather than penetrate the crowds at Old Faithful, I drove us to West Thumb Geyser Basin, a caldera formed by a volcanic explosion 174,000 years ago, according to the $1 trail guide. A billboard warned visitors to stay on the boardwalk: “More than a dozen people have been scalded to death and hundreds badly burned and scarred.” There were hot springs, miniature mud volcanoes (mudpots), geysers and microbial mats whose pigmented bacteria set the earth aglow in spectacular colors: turquoise, green, orange. Tourists posed in front of Fishing Cone where, in the early 1900s, fishermen came to “hook and cook”: catch a trout from Yellowstone Lake, then cook it while still on the line by dangling it over the geyser. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Though it’s quieter than the scene at Old Faithful, West Thumb was still too busy for us. We returned to the road. It was a crisp morning. The windows were down and the seat heaters were up and, without any fanfare, Dan reached forward and switched on the radio. I had proven myself worthy of Kenny Rogers. “The Gambler” took us toward Grand Teton National Park. I sang and Dan motioned for me to pull over every once in a while, like at Snake River Overlook on Route 191, where the photographer Ansel Adams used to capture the landscape. I was beginning to feel in control. “Beautiful,” Dan said every now and then when I cut a smooth curve. That night I had booked the cheapest room at the Four Seasons Resort and Residences in Jackson Hole, figuring we would be in need of a luxurious retreat to unwind after two days of high-altitude driving. On the contrary, we were invigorated. And by the next morning the weather couldn’t have been better. We sat outside on the wood deck at Persephone Bakery in downtown Jackson nibbling croissants and scones made with currants and ginger, black pepper and Cheddar, watching people come and go around Jackson Town Square. The Square is the heart of a grid of quaint streets with boutiques selling whatever it is one might need on a deluxe Western holiday: Pendleton wool blankets, Swarovski crystal, cowboy hats. We were staying in Teton Village, but had it been open, we would have tried the new Hotel Jackson downtown, now up and running with 58 rooms, all of which have fireplaces. Photo Farmland near Rexburg, Idaho. Credit Janie Osborne for The New York Times I wanted to linger, but we were hours from Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve, a more than 600-square-mile dormant lava field formed between 15,000 and 2,000 years ago. To get there we crawled through proverbial one-horse towns like Tetonia, Idaho, population 269 according to the sign. Between them, we flew. By then I knew I was going to try to finish the road trip without ever taking the passenger seat. U.S. Highway 20 West shoots straight through waves of green fields. Sightlines stretch to the horizon. There are Belted Galloway cattle, named for the thick white stripes across their middles; signs that say “Historical Site,” encouraging drivers to stop and check out a cave or a trail; and irrigation apparatus that Dan likened to giant mechanical centipedes. The sky was storybook blue and I was going 70, my highest speed so far. Through the windows came the sound of the wind and the smell of cut grass, and sometimes of skunk. Dan called it ambience. I was pushing 75 when he began fiddling with my iPhone. The opening bars of The Who’s “Baba O’Riley” blasted through the speakers and out into the plains. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story We seemed to be living the moment in Robert Penn Warren’s novel “All the King’s Men” when the narrator says: “I was headed out down a long bone-white road, straight as a string and smooth as glass and glittering and wavering in the heat and humming under the tires like a plucked nerve.” What felt so good? The speed, the sun, the wind, the fantasy of never looking back? Perhaps it’s just freeing to sing along with Guns N’ Roses while tearing through eastern Idaho. Outside Arco, which bills itself as the first city in the world to be lit by atomic power, a billboard says NUCLEAR REACTORS. This is the birthplace of the nuclear Navy, the Idaho National Laboratory, where since 1949 more nuclear reactors have been built than anywhere else. Beside the billboard are tidy bathrooms. You’ll know you’re nearing Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve when you see the scorched earth. The black mounds are cinder cones, part of a 52-mile chain of fissures. Pull over just before the entrance to the preserve and in the height of wildflower season you’ll find big sagebrush and shocking pink monkey flower defiantly blooming up out of the black rock. In the 1920s a geologist described this area as “the surface of the moon as seen through a telescope.” By the 1960s, NASA astronauts were studying volcanic geology here to prepare for moon missions. Given its charred landscape, the preserve can feel stark after a while, though climbing the Inferno Cone is a must for the panoramic views. Before leaving we asked the women at the visitors’ center where to find the falls that give Idaho Falls its name. They laughed. “There are none.” About an hour and a half later I unlocked the door to a room at the Hilton Garden Inn Idaho Falls and there, off the balcony, were the falls. So they’re man-made. So what. They exist. They flow onto a dam on the Snake River. That evening the sky burned neon pink over the Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Families of geese waddled around a five-mile greenbelt on the banks of the river shared with skateboarders, bicyclists and, ah, pedestrians. From the balcony we watched the day extinguish, the last families pushing their strollers toward home. The next morning, it was our turn to go home. The odometer was just shy of 700 miles. I drove them all. Not for a second had I thought I could do it and, frankly, it would have been impossible without the right person riding shotgun. It was about 80 degrees when I parked the car at Idaho Falls Regional Airport. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-30T12:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T17:54:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
