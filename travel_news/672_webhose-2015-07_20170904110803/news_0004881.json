Hieronymites Monastery shelters the tomb of Vasco da Gama, the discoverer of India, and the Belém Tower on the River Tejo, or Tagus, was built to honour him.\nAnother essential spot to visit in Lisbon is the Moorish São Jorge castle on top of the hill. While you climb up, remember to stop and admire the incredible views of the medieval Alfama district.\nLisbon is also renowned for museums and art exhibitions. Berardo Museum’s vast modern art collections range fromPicasso to Dali and Warhol. Entrance to the museum is free. Art is also present on the streets, as the walls of many buildings are covered by beautiful although at times somewhat decrepit decorative tiles.\nPortuguese delicacies\nOne of the main features of Portuguese cuisine is its uncomplicated nature. Anything made of fresh fish or any seafood is always a great experience, but don’t forget to try bacalhau, dried cod, as it’s the country’s national dish.\nLisbon is full of restaurants, from tiny corner cafés to fine dining establishments. For instance, the Belcanto has two Michelin Stars and is praised by many.\nAfter dinner you could head to Bairro Alto district and enjoy its rambling streets and dozens of bars full of life. The trendiest club is probably Lux, situated a short distance from the city.\nMusic lovers can’t miss the opportunity to experience fado in one of the city’s many fado clubs. This melancholy or even mournful music somehow feels familiar to many Finns; after all, Portugal is in many ways similar to Finland, since both are small modest nations on the edge of Europe.\nColourful excursions\nLisbon’s magnificent sea aquarium, Oceanarium, is located in Parque das Nacoes, a very popular weekend destination for the locals. As you walk on the waterfront boulevard, you can see the Vasco da Gama Bridge, which is Europe’s longest bridge, at 17 km long.\nSintra, a small town on the slopes of the Serra mountains, is a great destination for a day trip. A return train trip will cost only a few euros. A train trip of under an hour can also take you to Cascais or Estoril, beaches that are popular among surfers.\nThe price levels in Portugal won’t feel very steep. It’s no wonder that many have decided to buy a second home or opted for a long-term rental home in the country. The climate is pleasant, since temperatures rarely drop below 10 degrees even in winter.\nTAP Air Portugal, known for its good service, is celebrating its 70th anniversary this year, and will fly you direct from Helsinki Airport to Lisbon six days a week. Lisbon offers good connections to Africa and South America, for example. The distance from the airport to the city is only 7 km.\nSource:- Finavia\nRelated Posts Chelsea Football Club Hosts Leaders Sport Summit 2013, the world’s most Prestigious Sport Business Summit Art performance at Helsinki airport on March 26 GoSleep pods now at gates 31 and 37 Take enough time at Helsinki Airport on Monday, 8 June Finavia to host a global aviation strategy conference in Helsinki", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T03:41:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
