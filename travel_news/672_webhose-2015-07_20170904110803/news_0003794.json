Other levels of the five-tiered membership program include Classic, Silver, Gold and Black. Personalized cruise cards will be provided to MSC Voyagers Club members directly on board at the beginning of each sailing with their membership level. \nAs part of the new program, MSC has revamped its points structure so that guests now earn points according to the inclusive experience booked (Bella, Fantastica, Aurea or MSC Yacht Club) as well as length of stay. In addition, points are rewarded for onboard spend as well as pre-paid services, such as shore excursions, spa treatments and beverage packages. \nAnother major benefit of the new program is that all MSC Voyagers Club members will have exclusive access to significant discounts on future cruises. Starting July 20, 2015, members will receive a 5 percent discount on all cruise departures (with the exception of the Welcome level). In addition, MSC will make available a broad array of select cruises, called Voyages Selection, that offer an extra 15 percent off – meaning that all members could receive up to a total of 20 percent off future cruises. And to sweeten the deal for higher-tier members, when booking a cruise from the Voyages Selection, Silver, Gold and Black level members will receive $50 of onboard credit per person. \nThe range of other privileges extended to MSC Voyagers Club members includes, among others, an invite to a welcome back cocktail party, complimentary basket of fresh fruit in the stateroom and exclusive onboard offers with discounts on items such as internet packages, spa treatments, logo shop items, in-stateroom movies, photos, and the minibar. \nTop tier members also enjoy added benefits such as priority boarding, priority disembarkation in ports where a tender boat is required, late stateroom check out when the ship returns to port, an invite to a private Black Card member party, complimentary spumante with chocolate-dipped fruit in the stateroom, increased onboard discounts, free one-hour thermal area session in MSC Aurea Spa, and complimentary dining in a specialty restaurant. \nLoyalty Match \nRecognizing that many travellers have built up loyalty with other travel reward programs, MSC Cruises is also launching a loyalty match program in which frequent travellers who have a rewards card from another travel land or sea program can now receive instant status and perks with MSC. After signing up for MSC Cruises' Voyages Club, guests who participate in other leisure travel programs will automatically acquire similar or higher status with MSC and be enrolled in the Classic, Silver, Gold, or Black level. In addition, these travellers will automatically receive the 5 percent discount on any booking given to MSC Voyagers Club members and can also take advantage of the discounts associated with Voyages Selection.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T06:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T06:29:18.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
