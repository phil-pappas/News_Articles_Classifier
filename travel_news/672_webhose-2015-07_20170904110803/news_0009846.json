The majority of Amsterdammers speak English very well and are happy to do so. I think of the Dutch approach to English-speaking visitors as the opposite of the French one, that is that the Dutch enjoy showing off their English skills and practicing them with tourists, while it's not uncommon to encounter resistance to speaking English in much of France (I realize this is a bit stereotypical; I've not had this experience on all visits to France). That said, I encourage visitors to Amsterdam to become familiar with at least a few basic Dutch greetings and polite words . Whether just to say thank you to your brown caf√© waitress or good morning to your bed-and-breakfast hosts, the gesture will be appreciated.
