Try these presidential hotels By Lynn O'Rourke Hayes Published: July 16, 2015 \nPair history with exploration when you and the family check into a storied hotel inspired by an American president. Here are five to consider. \nJefferson, Washington D.C. \nGet comfortable in this famed hotel and learn about the epicurean, intellectual, farmer, inventor and president it was named for. Kids will get a kick out of the free and fun \"Where's Tommy?\" tour of the capital city. Begin the adventure in the Beaux Arts-style hotel's cozy library before making your way to eight locations where Thomas Jefferson is remembered. Document your arrival at each location by posting on Instagram. Return to the hotel and you'll be rewarded with a treat, compliments of the chef, as well as a Thomas Jefferson bobblehead doll for completing the tour. Pets are welcome, too. \nThe President Abraham Lincoln hotel, Springfield, Ill. \nLearn about the 16th president during your stay in the home of Lincoln's presidential library and museum. Visit the well-regarded center featuring exhibits, artifacts, theatrical presentations and guest speakers of interest to all ages. Hop on the Springfield Trolley for easy access to more historic sites offering insight into the iconic leader's contributions to the American story. Then, turn back the clock and imagine life more than 150 years ago while visiting New Salem, a re-creation of Lincoln's 19th-century frontier village. \nUS Grant hotel, San Diego. \nLocated in the city's historic Gaslamp Quarter, the grand hotel was renovated by our 18th president's son Ulysses S. Grant Jr. Enjoy classic architecture combined with modern decor for a relaxing and luxurious family getaway. Take note of the hotel's $6.5-million collection of artwork, created by world-renowned artists from various backgrounds. The sculptures, ironwork, murals and paintings express the cultural landmark's blend of history and modern approach to hospitality. Enjoy nearby shopping, and the famed Southern California beaches and amusement parks are just a short drive away. \nMcKinley Grand Hotel, Canton, Ohio \nThis boutique, independent hotel is the ideal home base from which to learn about our 25th president. Visit the William McKinley Presidential Library and Museum for interactive, hands-on science exhibits, a planetarium and a historical library. The permanent McKinley Gallery display chronicles the path of a leader who was teaching in a country school when the Civil War broke out. Born in 1843, he served 14 years in the U.S. House before becoming president. A second term was cut short by his death at the hands of an assassin. Family travelers can also visit the nearby Pro Football Hall of Fame. \n\nThe Roosevelt, New Orleans \nBook the Family Fun package and create a memorable family getaway in the Big Easy. This historic 504-room hotel was first officially named to honor President Theodore Roosevelt in 1923 and recognize his efforts to build the Panama Canal, an event that served the city of New Orleans well. For a brief time, the landmark hotel operated under a different moniker. Then, 10 years ago it closed for a $145 million restoration after Hurricane Katrina and reopened, once again, as The Roosevelt. Just steps beyond the old-world grandeur of the hotel, you'll find the famed French Quarter, shopping, museums, galleries and, of course, music.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T22:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T05:12:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
