Air capacity, however, was restricted to manage the situation. In an earlier statement reported by flight delay news EU, NATS confirmed that the closure of U.K airspace did not appear to be the result of a security threat to the U.K. \nHeathrow is the U.K.’s busiest airport and also the busiest passenger traffic in Europe. The airport sees an average of 1,286 flights every day. EU airlines news reported that when the system shut down, 66 flights were cancelled affecting thousands of passengers. At least 14 airports were affected by Heathrow’s delay. The number increased further as NATS tried to return to full capacity. Followed by a technical glitch at Swanwick, a sister facility to the organization’s other location in Prestwick, Scotland, all the operations across UK came to a standstill. Swanwick controls the 200,000 square miles of airspace above England and Wales employing 1,300 controllers. The facility has been a frequent target to repeated trouble with radio communications and internal telephone system issues. \nThe glitch that caused delays at Heathrow and Gatwick had knock-on effects on other U.K. airports. According to flight delay news, 84 out of 1,300 flights were cancelled at Heathrow and delays extended to over an hour. All flights to London City were cancelled. Newcastle, Luton, Bristol, Edinburgh, East Midlands and Manchester flights were delayed. The flights to Birmingham were re-routed to avoid flying through London airspace. \nAccording to the E.U flight compensation laws, the stranded passengers are entitled to apply for compensation if the flight delays aren’t caused by ‘extraordinary circumstances’. People delayed over-night were put up in a large number of hotel rooms. Under EU rules, passengers delayed for over three hours are eligible to claim flight delay compensation based on the distance to the intended destination. \nAfter thorough investigation, experts said that the cause of the widespread system failure was caused by a glitch in the new upgraded software. The delay was caused because the controllers lost the support of their computer-based tools. Without the tools, the controllers couldn’t handle many simultaneous aircrafts affecting the upper airspace sector. \nThe controllers could have still contained the situation by radio systems, but adhering to strict safety regulation policy of NATS, the sky was cleared first by grounding all flights. If it were a power supply problem, it could have been rectified with a simple push of the back-up power generator. In recent news, a software problem in the Electronic Control Units (ECU) led to a crash, killing the four member team on board. These repeated events caused by software glitches highlights how reliant the airline industry has become on technologies which can fail too!
