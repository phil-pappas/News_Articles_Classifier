The award is given to Members of Congress who have contributed significantly to the protection and enhancement of America's national parks and recognizes Fattah's votes during the 113th Congress that contributed to their protection and enhancement. \n\"Our national parks are some of our country's greatest treasures and I am grateful to the NPCA for recognizing my efforts to preserve, protect, and enhance them,\" Congressman Fattah said. \"The City of Philadelphia has one of the greatest urban national parks in the United States—Independence National Historical Park—and I am proud to work with NPCA, my colleagues in Congress, and the National Park Service to continue ensuring these parks are maintained so they can be enjoyed by Americans now and into the future.\" \nNPCA's Friend of the National Parks Award was established in 1999 to track and publicize congressional members' votes on significant park issues. This year, NPCA tracked votes for three national park-related bills in the Senate and five in the House of Representatives. To receive the award, senators needed to vote in favor of national parks on at least two scored bills and representatives on at least three scored bills. \n\"It's an honor to recognize Congressman Fattah for supporting our national parks on the floor of the House during the 113th Congress,\" said NPCA President and CEO Clark Bunting. \"As the 114th Congress works on policies and funding levels impacting our nation parks, I look forward to working with Congressman Fattah to ensure national parks have safe roadways, are well maintained, and have the resources they need to thrive for their upcoming centennial.\" \nSince 1919, the nonpartisan National Parks Conservation Association has been the leading voice for America's national parks. NPCA and its members and supporters work together to protect and preserve the country's natural, historical, and cultural heritage for future generations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T04:34:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
