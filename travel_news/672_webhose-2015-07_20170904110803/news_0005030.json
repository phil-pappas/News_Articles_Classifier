But the report – a quarterly survey of SME owners and senior managers – also found that two-fifths of SMEs that do take on apprentices said it gives them access to the best young talent, and that 28pc found apprenticeships allowed them to build skills the business may be lacking. “There are many young people with good GCSE results who are now looking at work-based learning through apprenticeships as an alternative to further or higher education,” says Jill Barnes, chief executive of Exemplas, a national SME support organisation based at the University of Hertfordshire. “SMEs may be pleasantly surprised by the quality and enthusiasm of many of the young people out there.” But she admits there are barriers – real and imagined – that keep SMEs from taking on apprentices, from concerns over red tape to suspicions about the quality and job-readiness of young people and the investment needed to train them. Syd Nadim, founder of digital marketing agency Clock, which currently supports six apprentices working across two businesses, as well as a long-standing placement scheme, says that small companies have natural concerns about their ability to mentor young people, but believes SMEs need to realise that apprenticeships are not simply extended periods of work experience. My assistant manager was apprenticed 17 years ago and is about to be promoted to a director “Work experience is great, and we do still need to do that and give back, but that’s very different from the apprenticeship scheme or placements which are driving longer-term value,” adds Mr Nadim. In Clock’s case, that value has been real and considerable. Around 40pc of the company’s nearly 50 staff were once on placement at the company. Like Clock, dental practice group Barbican Dental Care (BDC) started offering dental nurse apprenticeships to young people from the local community, partly from a sense of altruism. “But we knew that if it were to be a model to move forward, it had to be a viable business proposition,” says founder Neil Sikka. He adds that after a short period of training apprentices can take the place of agency nurses, saving the business money and having a better understanding of BDC’s culture. For busy SMEs, these benefits are easy to overlook. But both companies say that after three months of training capable apprentices can start adding value to a business. Andy Reynolds, founder of Somerset-based service and repair garage AJ Reynolds, has taken on 16 apprentices since he started the business in 1991. He believes that apprenticeships, more than recruitment, give a business the staff and skills it needs. “My feeling was always that an apprentice could be trained with my skills and my ethics, and they would also understand my business and how it works,” he says. Twelve of AJ Reynolds’ apprentices have gone on to become excellent mechanics (with one still in college), and one has now served 13 years with the company. “My assistant manager was apprenticed 17 years ago and is about to be promoted to a director,” Mr Reynolds adds. This successful retention is partly because AJ Reynolds invites potential apprentices in for a week’s trial, and others agree that good contacts with local training providers and a thorough selection process is essential. “We always interview,” says Clock’s Mr Nadim. “It’s the same procedure you would go through to get anyone to join the business.” With that in mind, SMEs which go into the process with their eyes open can derive real benefit from an apprenticeship scheme. “It is a commitment,” says Exemplas’ Ms Barnes. “However, if the chemistry is right, and there is also the commitment for the learner and support from the training provider, then it is win-win all round.” • For more advice on preparing your business for the tech challenges of the future, visit HP BusinessNow You may also be interested in: • What kind of environment creates the ultimate entrepreneur? • Will a rise in bank lending fuel small business growth? • Life's a pitch for start-ups", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T02:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T23:22:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
