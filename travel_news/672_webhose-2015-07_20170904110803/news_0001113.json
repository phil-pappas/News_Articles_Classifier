Launched June 2, Belmond offers train service between London and Berlin aboard the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express. The overnight journey—with a starting price of $3,432 per person—includes breakfast, a Bellini brunch, a three-course lunch, and a four-course dinner while crossing the English Channel and passing through Paris. And what more fitting way to complement the French countryside than with a flute of the region’s finest from the train’s new Champagne bar. Premium pours include Laurent-Perrier Rosé, Taittinger, and Louis Roederer Cristal served with Lalique-crystal ice buckets and glassware. As a toast to its celebrated past, the train (made famous by Agatha Christie’s heralded whodunit, Murder on the Orient Express ) recently contributed to the late author’s 125th birthday celebration. Its chef, Christian Bodiguel, helped host a gala to honor the maven of suspense at the Belmond Hotel Cipriani in Italy on July 1. \nIt is no mystery, however, where the brand plans to expand next. Beginning in August 2016, the Belmond Grand Hibernian will explore the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland by rail. The two-, four-, or six-night tours include daily dining, drinks, and guided side trips. Able to accommodate 40 passengers, the train—decked in Dublin-inspired Georgian detailing—carries en suite cabins, two dining cars, and an observation car—a natural draw when traveling through the dramatic landscape. Reservations are currently being accepted for the Ireland itinerary that starts at $3,450 per person. \nThose who prefer more spectacle than spectacular scenery can now board the Belmond Northern Belle for an evening of entertainment. Departing from select stations in England from September through November, passengers will be treated to a 1930s, cabaret-style variety show and five-course dinner. Tickets start at $384 per person.
