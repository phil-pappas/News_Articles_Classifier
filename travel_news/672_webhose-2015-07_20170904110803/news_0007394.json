But this time, it’ll be in all good fun at Vero Beach Pirate Festival, Friday through Sunday.\nPirates first invaded the east coast in 1715, when a fleet of Spanish ships, loaded with treasure, sailed into the path of a hurricane. The fleet and treasure were all lost at sea.\nThe festival will include historical re-enactments, costume contests, interactive games, vendors, music and Mermaid Mia. Contributed This year, on the 300th anniversary of the fateful voyage, pirates and treasure hunters and all around fun seekers will meet up in Vero Beach to commemorate loss of the 1715 treasure-filled ships.\nThe festival, hosted by Pirates of the Treasure Coast and the Vero Beach Chamber of Commerce and held beneath the shade of 300-year-old oak trees in Riverside Park, will include historical re-enactments, costume contests, interactive games, vendors, mermaids, music and other entertainment for all ages.\nHours are from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Friday, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday. Admission is free, although donations are appreciated. Some of the proceeds of the event will go toward the Save the Indian River Lagoon Estuary Now charity and the Indian River County Veterans Council.\nLike pirates? You’ll see many of them this weekend at Vero Beach’s Pirate Festival in Riverside Park.
