The troubles of the Second World War were beginning to fade into memory and the country transformed itself into a bright, hopeful land full of excitement and technicolour TV. Here are 11 defining instances that you're bound to relate to if you were a teenager in the 1960s. You remember when Swiss Family Robinson was the biggest thing to hit the screens The film based on the 1812 novel of the same name was a box office hit and is generally considered to be one of the most iconic live action Disney films of all time. It's estimated earnings of around $40 million (£25 million) made it was highest grossing film of 1960, beating movies like Psycho and Exodus. The box office revenue of $427 million (£273 million) makes it one of the biggest hits of all time. 'Yellow Submarine' was all you listened to Yellow Submarine record pocket (Film Stills) The sixth song on the Beatles Revolver album is now one of their most well known songs. Back in 1966 when it was first released it shot to the top of every major British chart and remained at number for four weeks making it the most successful Beatles song to have Ringo Starr as the lead vocalist. You either had a crush on Twiggy or you wanted to be her Known for the thin silhouette, androgynous look and wide, doe-like eyes, Twiggy became one of the first true international supermodels and fashion icon for teens in the 60s. Twiggy's face became a staple on the front covers magazines, from Vogue to Tatler and she inspired a generation, even bringing out her own line of clothes called 'Twiggy Dresses'. You remember seeing your first miniskirt Miniskirts worn for anything but sport was unheard of (Rex) Though they're common place now, prior to the 60s short skirts were only worn if you were involved in a sport or dance. That all changed after Britsh style icon Mary Quant began experimenting with shorter skirts, creating the miniskirt in 1964. Quant's skirt is widely considered to be one of the defining fashions of the decade. You ate food trapped in jelly Food set in aspic was all the rage in the 1960s (ALAMY) Food set in aspic, a dish in which ingredients are set into a gelatin made from a meat stock, was a common sight during the 60s. Dr Polly Russell looked at foods from different decades for the BBC show 'Back in Time for Dinner' and said: \"As you move into the Sixties, there is suddenly more disposable income, people are experimenting more, and there’s an emphasis on foods that are more about display. \"Sadly, a lot of those were definitely style over substance.” This meant you probably watched in awe and apprehension as your mother set a dish of cold lamb and pea mint set in a savoury jelly - essentially a jello roast. Rosemary's Baby was the creepiest thing you'd ever seen Mia Farrow in Rosemary's Baby (Alamy) The 1968 psychological horror, directed by Roman Polanski , was a commerical success earning $33 million (£21 million) in the US. Starring Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes, Rosemary's Baby was met with almost unanimous universal acclaim from both critics and audiences. It is ranked 9th on the American Film Institute's '100 Years...100 Thrills' list and was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the US National Film Registry in 2014. Colour TV was a huge thing In Pleasantville, the world turns from black and white to in colour (Film Stills) Though we take it for granted now, prior to the 60s, colour TV was a rarity. In 1966, the BBC announced plans to start broadcasting programmes in colour, making Britain the first country in Europe to offer regular programming in colour. Colour TV licences were introduced in 1968, costing £10 - double the cost of a black and white TV licence. The moon landing blew your mind Buzz Aldrin on the moon in 1969 (Nasa) We've recently seen clear images of Pluto , but in 1969 two men walking on the moon was height of space discovery. The Apollo 11 mission launched from Kennedy Space Centre in Florida at 9.37 am on July 16 1969. Millions of people watched the event worldwide. In the UK, BBC1, BBC2 and ITV provided extensive coverage, though most of the footage has now been either wiped or lost. You remember when only married women were allowed the pill It took six years for the pill to be made available to all women (Reuters) The pill was developed by the American biologist Dr Gregory Pincus in the 50s, and introduced in the UK on the NHS in 1961 - but it was for married women only. It took till 1967 for this to be changed to make it avaiable to all women. Currently, the pill is taken by over 100 million women around the world. You saw feminist history The striking Ford factory workers (Daily Herald) In 1968, the Ford female sewing machinists strike triggered the passing of the Equal Pay Act 1970. Led by Rose Boland, Eileen Pullen, Vera Sime, Gwen Davis, and Sheila Douglass, the machinists walked out after they were told their jobs had been graded 'Category C' - less skilled production jobs - and they would be paid 15 per cent than the rate men received for doing 'Category B' jobs. You thought the special effects in Mary Poppins were amazing A live-action and cartoon scene in Mary Poppins (Rex) We've come a long way in the field of special effects since 1964, but at the time the blended live-action and animated Mary Poppins movie was somewhat revolutionary. It was named the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Achievement in Special Visual Effects thanks to its spectucular technique of combining cartoons with real people. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T10:20:42.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
