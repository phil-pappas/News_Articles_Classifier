Thanks to their Maxx Protocol Services and Maxx Royal CIP Lounge Services offered exclusively to villa guests at both resorts, the holiday truly starts the moment guests step off the plane in Antalya. \nThe two resorts offer a range of premier services to guests staying at selected villas for a minimum of seven nights, at no extra cost. From the moment guests touch down at Antalya International Airport, a Maxx Royal hostess will be waiting at the door of the plane to escort them into a private vehicle on the tarmac for transfer to the Maxx Royal CIP Terminal Lounge, for a refreshing cocktail and snack. After skipping the queues at passport control, guests are whisked into their private airport transfer – a luxury helicopter. No Maxx Royal guest misses out on this exclusive service, as the queue jump in the airport and an invitation to the Maxx Royal CIP Terminal Lounges is extended to all. VIP guests continue to receive the Maxx Royalty treatment from arrival, when they are presented with Dom Perignon champagne and fresh flowers at check in, along with personal pillow and room fragrance menus. An all-inclusive butler service awaits at their Villas, which range from 350m² (sleeping 7 adults) – 630m² (sleeping 12 adults) in size. Other perks on offer is unlimited 24 hour room service, laundry service, special access to the Villa Restaurant and Bar, a private cabana reserved on the beach, relaxing in private Jacuzzis or in some cases, built in spa and Hammam. Upon departure, villa guests can expect an equally indulgent experience to that they had on arrival. Maxx Royal holidays are guaranteed to end on a high, with the quick and thrilling helicopter transfer back to Antalya Airport, allowing time to relish the complimentary range of delicious food and extensive selection of beverages on offer in the Maxx Royal CIP Terminal Lounge, before catching a flight home. The complimentary Maxx Protocol services, including the helicopter transfer are strictly offered to Albatross Villa, King Suite, Presidential Villa and Owner Villa guests at Maxx Royal Belek, and to Royal Beach Villa and Presidential Villa occupants at Maxx Royal Kemer Resort. All Maxx Royal guests are invited to enjoy the Maxx Royal CIP Lounge and Fast Direct Services.
