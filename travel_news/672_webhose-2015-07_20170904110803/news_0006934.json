Eunice is stuck again.”\nWe’re just pulling off 75 Mile Beach, ready to climb a short ascent to Lake Wabby lookout, when the troublemaker of the group digs her heels into the soft sand and refuses to budge.\nOut of nowhere an over-enthusiastic group of backpackers swoops in to perform a rescue operation but my co-driver’s not having any of it. We’re on our knees digging the sand out from the bogged back wheels when she brushes past them with a coy, “we are trained in this, you know”.\nAfter falling into a fit of laughter, we coax Eunice (the ute) into the right gear and roll it back along the Maxtrax, ready to bound back up the hill like a lovable labrador and continue on our way. Thanks anyway, guys.\nIf you had asked me yesterday what snatch straps or Maxtrax were, I would have looked more gobsmacked than our would-be rescuers.\nBut now, after spending the morning being schooled on all things four-wheel drive by the unflappable Dave Darmody from Australian Offroad Academy, our group of 10 girls are bona fide experts. Well, we’re able to manoeuvre our rental 4WD beasts along Fraser Island’s tracks without freaking out, at least. Our Girls Got Grit group sets off. Picture: Krista Eppelstun Source: Supplied\nThe course is called Girls Got Grit – a new two-day package designed specifically for women to get behind the wheel and smash through the intimidating internal barriers built up around off-roading on the world’s largest sand island.\n“We found 90 per cent of bookings (to the island) are made by women but they always leave the driving up to their partners,” Dave tells us over morning tea, served from his dual cab on a shelf replete with organic coffee and gluten-free friands.\nAdmittedly, picking up my 4WD for the weekend had left me wondering what I had signed up for.\nTony from Coastal 4WD Hire – who says they lose about 80 vehicles between Rainbow Beach and Fraser Island each year – clearly has a passion for his job, and no shortage of hilariously idiot-behaviour examples to draw on in his pre-hire safety briefing.\nWe flick through the images and videos on his iPad: Vehicles stranded like lost puppies in the middle of a rising tide, utes submerged in the surf, a caravan on its roof, a broken chassis ... Tony’s seen it all.\n“That’s just yobbo behaviour; caveman stuff,” he says.\n“They didn’t do their research. A lot of people just don’t want to listen either.”\nAfter getting acquainted with my Nissan Patrol – unfortunately named the “Pootrol” once the convoy walkie-talkie banter heats up – and driving to Hervey Bay, my first test was to reverse on to the Kingfisher Ferry. Deemed a success, with a nod of approval from Dave and back slapping from my passengers, I start to feel a little more confident. And we haven’t even let the tyres down yet. Attaching the snatch straps for our recovery test. Picture: Celeste Mitchell Source: Supplied\nOf course, it wouldn’t be a girls’ weekend without a little pampering too. Upon arriving at Kingfisher Bay Resort’s Jetty Hut, we toasted the sunset at one of only a handful of places on Australia’s east coast where you can witness the sun melting into the horizon.\nWhat followed was an unexpected move from grit to gourmet, with a three-course meal at the resort’s Seabelle restaurant. Drawing inspiration from Fraser Island’s indigenous Butchulla tribe, the menu here is pure Australiana with traditional bush foods the hero.\nI start with the beef and smoked kangaroo carpaccio, luxuriating in lashings of the three-herb panna cotta and hints of sour quandong jam with truffle oil and cracked pepperberry with each delicate mouthful. The presentation is superb and the portion size deceiving. I barely make it through my lamb backstrap, perfectly tender and flavoured with native honey and pepperberry jus, but manage to find room for the Callebaut chocolate parfait with wattleseed custard.\nThe resort holds bush-tucker talk and taste sessions every Monday, Wednesday and Friday for guests who wish to see the ingredients in their raw state and learn more about traditional uses.\nThe next morning, school is in session and we’re not going anywhere before graduating from the custom-built four-wheel-drive training track within Kingfisher. The FJ Cruiser (aka the Silver Surfer) tackling the 'Wombat Holes'. Picture: Celeste Mitchell Source: Supplied\nA series of tight corners, bumpy “wombat holes” and challenging hills, the course is like cross-fit for 4WDs – built specifically for novice drivers to give you the motivation and confidence required to tackle Fraser’s sandy inland and “beach highway” tracks.\n“There’s no driving environment that’s more dynamic than a beach,” Dave says. “And if you’ve learnt to drive 4WD on DVD, you’ve learnt some really bad practices.”\nIt’s intimidating at first, but once each obstacle is conquered, we immediately feel like we’ve been off-roading for years. A former primary school teacher and dad to two girls, Dave has the nerve-soothing demeanour you want in a driving instructor, and 20 years of experience on Fraser Island’s sandy tracks.\nTide timing, we learn, is everything when you’re setting out for a day of driving on Fraser Island. Ensuring we’re not on the beach within two hours either side of high tide means each day’s driving is plotted with precision – with plenty of room allowed for the inevitable bogging that will happen.\nGiven the speed limit of the inland tracks sits at 30km/h, slow and steady is the name of the game.\n“My overriding rule of anything on Fraser Island is if you’re in a rush, you’ve got your priorities wrong,” Dave says. Morning tea is served. Picture: Celeste Mitchell. Source: Supplied\nWithin a few hours we’ve become pros in PSI, low range versus high range, and safe recovery techniques, and set off in convoy to explore the World Heritage-listed oasis.\n“Everything we’re going to do is challenge by choice,” Dave says. “No one’s keeping score.”\n“A lot of four-wheel driving is letting the vehicle do its thing.”\nI’ve visited Fraser once before on a one-day bus tour but soon realise nothing can compare to self-driving and setting the itinerary yourself.\nWhen I’m not concentrating on following the tyre tracks in the soft sand in front of me, my attention is absorbed by the bipolar landscape.\nWe start in scrubby bushland with dark sand on our tyres at Kingfisher and move through beautiful glossy rainforest and out to the endless white sand of 75 Mile Beach. Kauri pines make way for sprawling pandanus, whipbirds and frog calls make way for soaring white-bellied sea eagles and to our delight, a pair of dingoes strutting their stuff just near Eli Creek.\nOn one drive we rattle and roll our way to Lake McKenzie and swim in the too-turquoise-to-be-true freshwater. We take turns behind the wheel and cheer each other on as challenges are overcome, beginning to feel like old hands in no time. The fleet pictured during a break. Picture: Reichlyn Aguilar Source: Supplied\nOn another we give all those late-night karaoke bars a run for their money over our walkie talkies, all the way to the Maheno Wreck for a photo stop, Jaffa Cake and tea.\nIn our concentration on becoming 4WD pros, we forget phone service and deadlines back on the mainland. And after a weekend spent behind the wheel, I return home with a new vocabulary and a burning desire to buy some new wheels.\nMy ’96 Mitsubishi Lancer just isn’t going to cut it anymore.\nThe writer travelled courtesy of Tourism and Events Queensland, Kingfisher Bay Resort and Australian Offroad Academy.\nGO2\nFRASER ISLAND\nGETTING THERE\nThe Kingfisher Barge terminal at River Heads is a four-hour drive north of Brisbane.
