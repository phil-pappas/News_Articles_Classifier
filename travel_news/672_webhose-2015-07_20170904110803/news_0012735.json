I was in a town called Santo Padre delle Perriere in Sicily talking to the man who owned the holiday apartments. He was also in charge of putting up the lights at Christmas time and taking care of the priests who came from the north of Italy. “The cousin” is called Peppe. Peppe has blue eyes – one glass and one real – and dark hair dyed a cheap jet black. No one messes with Peppe. He practically owns the town; all four streets of it. We arrived on a sweaty afternoon in early June. Peppe was outside the holiday flat waiting to show us around. We loved it. • Sicily: a travel guide As the days blurred with heat, a slow routine set in. We walked along the deserted roads – yellow with dust from the sandstone quarry nearby, we took lazy drives to the beach or read for hours. Most afternoons were eerily quiet with not a cat in sight. Then the priests arrived. There were 10 of them chaperoned by an older priest. The cousin told us that they were on a pilgrimage to see the statue of Santo Padre delle Perriere. “The statue is for men, especially naughty men,” he said as he winked his good eye. One afternoon when the heat made it impossible to venture further than the front porch, the priests decided to wash their car – an old Fiat Cinquecento. Sandwich in hand, I went outside to watch. Their bodies in swimming trunks were so pale they were grey. One had a hosepipe and sprayed the car. The others held sponges. One got dishwashing liquid in his eye and had to be hosed down. Soon they were all spraying each other and giggling like schoolgirls. I wondered when last they actually let their hair down. • A guide to the 19 best Greek islands On another day, we did as the priests did and took a walk to the famous saint’s chapel. It was quiet; a breath of air caught a sign and made it squeak on its unoiled hinges. At the chapel, men in well-cut suits did the sign of the cross and kissed their fingers as a religious formality. It was a miracle they didn’t sweat. We overheard two men talking. “I must keep both of them happy all the time. I am cursed!” he said of his wife and his mistress. A slap to my back made me jump. “I see you found him,” said the cousin, his glass eye fixed on my cleavage. “It’s not for you. It’s for men only,” he said, turning to my husband. “You can stay.” I cast my husband an exaggerated wink and made my way back to the holiday flat to fetch the car so that I could go to the beach. It was a good day for doing nothing. Enter the next round  Email your entry, in 500 words (with the text in the body of the email), to justback@telegraph.co.uk by midnight on Wednesday.
