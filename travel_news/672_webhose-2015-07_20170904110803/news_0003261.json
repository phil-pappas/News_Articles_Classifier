There are 65 bedrooms with a choice of standard, executive and deluxe options, alongside exuberant suites and fully serviced apartment, The Mount provides a warm welcome to a complete range of private, corporate and event guests. Guest rooms are found within the period building, stunning courtyard conversions and accommodation wing on the grounds. Since completion of the refurbishment, The Mount has seen an increase in visitor numbers and recognition by TripAdvisor, Laterooms and the AA Rosette awards.
