People in contact with horses need to continue to practice good biosecurity and personal hygiene measures even if a horse is vaccinated against Hendra virus.”\nDr Crook said the latest Hendra virus case was a timely reminder for anybody transporting horses to this year’s Brisbane Ekka, due to start next month.\nShe said exhibitors were required to demonstrate proof of Hendra virus vaccination.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:12:16.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
