Gareth A Davies Tackling a spit-roasted lamb with Mike Gatting was like a medieval joust. And given his penchant for this brand of cooking, there was only going to be one winner. The lamb was delicious, served with new potatoes, green beans and carrots from the garden of David Whittington, Ebernoe’s No 7 batsman. A perfect mint sauce and creamy gravy completed the treat. Mike Gatting This was the kind of meal we were served at Lord’s for lunch when I played there. It was worthy of a meal at the home of cricket. It was a wonderful tea, and the lamb was roasted to perfection. I had no issue at all with having a second helping, along with the home-made mint sauce. The greens, potatoes and carrots were expertly prepared by the tea ladies, and when I tasted the banoffee pie, I was in heaven. Vaughan's verdict: the chocolate torte Each of the six finalists bakes a cake for former England captain Michael Vaughan. Ebernoe’s was a chocolate torte with fudge icing and cherries, made by Kay Turner. Michael Vaughan says: \"An utterly delicious cake with a beautifully moist centre. The chocolate fudge icing was great!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T18:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T13:59:46.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
