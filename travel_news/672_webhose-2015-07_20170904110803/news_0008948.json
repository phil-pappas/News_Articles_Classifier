Rekha has been pivotal in seeing The Belfry through a £26m refurbishment and re-positioning in the market place to set it apart as the luxury hotel of choice in the Meetings Incentives Conferences and Events market and is being considered for entry to the miaList. \nThe miaList is a celebration of individuals within the MICE industry and recognises those hardworking, enthusiastic and inspiring candidates that have a positive influence within their respective workplaces. All shortlisted candidates first attend a judging lunch with a short interview during which they are marked against an extensive criteria. The miaList winners in a total of six categories will then be announced at a celebratory lunch on September 28th 2015 at the Park Plaza Riverbank, London. Rekha will face stiff competition in the Conference category, with Food & Beverage, Front of House, Sales and Marketing, Support People and Housekeeping awards also being presented at the glitzy awards ceremony. Through the judging process, the miaList’s panel of judges will be looking for evidence that demonstrates how the nominees have gone above and beyond the call of duty and acts as a source of support, encouragement or inspiration to those around them, among many other criteria. The Belfry’s Director of Sales, Katie Niland, who nominated Rekha said: “Rekha has an attitude that is flawless and a drive to achieve both financial and team results. “She has played a pivotal role in the sales transformation and has engendered an energetic, winning and motivated culture at The Belfry. She inspires her team and is a leading example of a head of department that will move very quickly into an executive level role through her professionalism and exemplary management style.” Among Rekha’s accomplishments over the last year are achieving year-in-year growth in the Group/M&E segment, improving functionality of the sales process by implementing a new commercially viable structure and motivating her team through clearly set KPI’s including daily and weekly measurable targets.
