CNE officials closed all those shelters on Friday following the evacuees’ return home.\nEmergency officials evacuated a total of 968 people, who received food and emergency supplies. The last remaining shelter, in Sarapiquí, closed Friday afternoon after all 283 evacuees left the facility.\nCNE President Iván Brenes Reyes said that they will maintain regular monitoring and continue evaluations of all affected areas despite the current favorable weather.\nThe agency on Friday reported that some 4,200 homes in 22 cantons were affected by harsh weather conditions over the past several days. Flooding also damaged at least 500 drinking water sources, including wells and aqueducts.\nGovernment officials are still assessing losses in crops, livestock and other farming activities and will issue a report in the coming days, Brenes said. Earlier this week banana and pineapple producers reported considerable damage caused by the inclement weather. Costa Rica is the world’s single largest pineapple producer and the second largest banana producer behind Ecuador.\nOn Friday evening the National Meteorological Institute ( IMN ) forecast intermittent rains for the mountainous areas of both the Caribbean and the northern regions through the weekend.\nIMN estimates rainfall levels of 20-40 millimeters over periods ranging from 6 to 12 hours, “which correspond to the normal average rainfall of the country’s rainy season for these regions.”\nExperts recommend that residents in the most affected areas remain vigilant as strong gusts up to 70 kilometers per hour are expected in both regions.\nRead more of our rainy season coverage here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T18:19:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
