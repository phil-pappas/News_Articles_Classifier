Following closely behind would be China, Australia and India with 2.8 per cent, 2.7 per cent and 2.6 per cent increases respectively. \n\nOther hotspots projected to see price increases are Colombia and Mexico. \n\nAsia-Pacific will also see hotel prices rise by three per cent â€” led by Singapore, Japan and Australia. \n\nMeanwhile, Asia-Pacific is expected see a five per cent increase in cost per attendee per day and an 11 per cent increase in group size, driven by strong demand from China and India.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T16:32:26.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
