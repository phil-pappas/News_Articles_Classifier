Sign In Here The Texas Central Partners hammered another stake in the tracks on its way to completing a more than 200-mile bullet train from Dallas to Houston. The company named Tim Keith as its first CEO on July 22. Keith, a Dallas resident, will lead the system’s finance, development, construction and eventual operations. He has 25 years of financial and operational experience in large real estate and infrastructure projects. Formerly, Keith was the global CEO of RREEF/Deutsch Bank Infrastructure Investments. There’s still a lot of uncertainty around the high-speed rail project for Houstonians. For one, where the route will travel through the city hasn’t been determined, or if it will even make it downtown at all. Train stops also haven’t been determined, and if or how it will have any connection to the city’s existing public transportation infrastructure. But despite all of that, Keith and his team still fully intend to begin construction in 2017. What are the statuses with the stations in (Houston)? There’s a handful of sites, and we’re working through the process to make sure the FRA guides us in the right decision with any one of those. The main point about all the stations, whether it be Houston, Dallas or the one near College Station, is about connectivity and making sure we can provide easy, efficient, comfortable interaction with automobiles, highways, Metro lines and buses. You mention a handful of sites in Houston. What are some of those sites that Texas Central Railway and the FRA are looking at? There are studies on northwest (Houston), along the Interstate 10 corridor and then into downtown. A lot of the impact the FRA is interested in overlaps with the city of Houston’s and Harris County’s interest fitting into the transportation plans and making a small as possible impact on the communities and neighborhoods we pass through. So is a downtown station up for consideration? It is still part of the environmental impact statement study process. To be clear, as we did with the route selection with the utility corridor, we’ll have some opinions as we get more information, but ultimately the EIS, which comes out of the FRA interactions, will determine our final location. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Status Update The Texas Central Railway is in the midst of its environmental impact study, led by the Federal Railroad Administration. That study, expected to be available for public review in late 2015, will contain comments from the public, feasibility of the rail itself and preferred routes. The project received its first influx of capital, a $75 million round raised by several Dallas and Houston investors, including Houston entrepreneur Drayton McClane Jr. If all goes according to plan, the project could be completed by 2021. Others weigh in “No information has been provided, that substantiates the necessity for the line terminating in downtown Houston as opposed to in a location farther to the north or northwest, which would eliminate the need to run the train through the neighborhoods. Why must the proposed rail terminate in downtown Houston?” Melissa Hamous, who submitted a comment to the FRA on the feasibility of the high-speed rail. \nWant Houston Travel news in your inbox?
