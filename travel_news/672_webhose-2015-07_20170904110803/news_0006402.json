Subscribe now to Sean Ryan The Marcus Center for the Performing Arts in downtown Milwaukee The Marcus Center for the Performing Arts is starting a $4 million-plus repair to add up to 10 years to the life of its parking structure, but officials still are pursuing a potential redevelopment of the property. The center’s parking structure on North Water Street in downtown Milwaukee is aging and requires repairs now. But center officials for more than two years have eyed plans to demolish the structure and build in its place a mixed-use development with a new, larger structure but also “substantial commercial or residential,” said Paul Mathews , Marcus Center president and CEO. Center officials in 2013 had hoped to move the new development forward in time to avoid the costly repair work. Work has begun to add eight to 10 years to the life of the 700-stall existing parking structure, Mathews said. “We would look to pursue a redevelopment opportunity in a shorter period of time than eight to 10 years,” Mathews said. The envisioned redevelopment is intended to generate more operating money for the Marcus Center through additional parking stalls and spaces that could be leased for events or nearby restaurants. Mathews said that is still the goal, but the focus currently is on the repair. The Marcus Center will borrow $4.05 million from Johnson Bank, Milwaukee, for the repair. It would mark the second time the nonprofit organization has spent money to keep the structure open as it pursues a new development for that property. The center in 2013 and 2014 spent $900,000 on repairs. \nWant Milwaukee Commercial Real Estate news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
