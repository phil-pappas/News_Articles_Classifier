Operating income was $8,580,000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, a 10.3% decrease from operating income of $9,564,000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Fourth quarter fiscal 2015 operating income would have increased if not for a one-time pre-tax impairment charge of $2,603,000 related to the company’s hotels and resorts division. Net earnings attributable to The Marcus Corporation were $3,249,000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, a 23.6% decrease from net earnings attributable to The Marcus Corporation of $4,254,000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Fourth quarter net earnings attributable to The Marcus Corporation would have increased if not for the after-tax impairment charge of approximately $1,562,000 in the hotels and resorts division. Net earnings per diluted common share attributable to The Marcus Corporation were $0.12 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, a 25.0% decrease from net earnings per diluted common share attributable to The Marcus Corporation of $0.16 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Net earnings per diluted common share attributable to The Marcus Corporation would have increased if not for the after-tax impairment charge of approximately $0.06 per diluted common share in the hotels and resorts division. \nFiscal 2015 Highlights Total revenues for fiscal 2015 were a record $488,067,000, a 9.0% increase from revenues of $447,939,000 for fiscal 2014. Operating income was $50,194,000 for fiscal 2015, a 3.7% increase from operating income of $48,382,000 for fiscal 2014.

Comparisons of net earnings attributable to The Marcus Corporation for fiscal 2015 were negatively impacted by the fact that results for fiscal 2014 benefited from an allocation of a $3.6 million pre-tax loss attributable to non-controlling interests related to a settlement with the company’s partners in the Skirvin Hilton hotel. The settlement increased fiscal 2014 net earnings attributable to The Marcus Corporation by approximately $0.08 per diluted common share. \n“Our fourth quarter performance provided a strong ending to an excellent year for The Marcus Corporation. Fiscal 2015 revenues set new records for the company and for both of our operating divisions. Marcus Theatres reported record operating income for fiscal 2015 and significantly outperformed the industry for the sixth consecutive quarter. However, operating income for Marcus Hotels & Resorts was reduced by the temporary impact of construction for the conversion of our downtown Chicago hotel into an AC Hotel by Marriott that opened in early June and the one-time impairment charge,” said Gregory S. Marcus, president and chief executive officer of The Marcus Corporation. \nMarcus Theatres ® \n“Marcus Theatres achieved record fourth-quarter revenues and record operating income for a 13-week fourth quarter. The division outperformed the industry for both the fourth quarter and full year by more than nine and 11 percentage points, respectively. The national box office for the corresponding weeks of our fourth quarter was up 1.1% according to Rentrak, while our box office was up 10.7%. For the fiscal 2015 period, the national box office was actually down 3.7%, while our box office was up 7.7%,” said Marcus. \n“In addition to our industry-leading attendance gains, we also achieved a substantial increase in concession revenues. Our expanded food and beverage concepts contributed to a 20.2% increase in concession revenues for the fourth quarter and a 17.5% increase in concession revenues for the fiscal year,” said Rolando B. Rodriguez, president and chief executive officer of Marcus Theatres. \nThe five top-performing films for Marcus Theatres in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 were Avengers: Age of Ultron, Furious 7, Pitch Perfect 2, Cinderella and Home. For fiscal 2015,the five top-performing movies were American Sniper, Avengers: Age of Ultron, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1, Furious 7 and Guardians of the Galaxy. \n“The summer is off to a strong start, with a solid box office for films including Spy, Jurassic World, Inside Out and Minions , and Ant-Man also opened well this past weekend. Potential hits for the remainder of the summer include Pixels, Paper Towns, Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation, Vacation, Fantastic Four and Straight Outta Compton ,” said Rodriguez. \nRodriguez said the division opened its newly constructed Palace Cinema in Sun Prairie, Wis., during the fourth quarter. Located near Madison, Wis., the theatre is designed to be a complete entertainment destination showcasing many of the company’s new amenities in one location. These include DreamLounger ® recliner seating in every auditorium, two massive Ultra Screen DLX ® auditoriums and all of the company’s signature food and beverage options. “The Palace is the ultimate in movie-going and the customer response has been outstanding,” said Rodriguez. \n“In addition to The Palace, the multi-million dollar investments in our circuit include significant renovations and additional new amenities at theatres across our footprint. In addition to The Palace, during fiscal 2015 we added DreamLounger recliner seating to four more existing theatres, and as of fiscal year end, offered this popular amenity in 27% of our company-owned first-run theatres and 30% of our screens. We believe these percentages are the highest among the top chains in the industry,” said Rodriguez. \nHe said the company also continued to expand its premium large-format screens, branded as Ultra Screen DLX and Super Screen ® DLX. Approximately 49% of company-owned first-run theatres now feature these proprietary large-format auditoriums, also believed to be among the highest percentages in the industry. \n“Expanding our signature food and beverage concepts is another key element of our growth strategy. We currently offer Take Five ® lounges in 29% of our company-owned first-run theatres and Zaffiro’s ® Express at 33% of these locations. We added Big Screen Bistro SM in-theatre dining to three more theatres in fiscal 2015, increasing the total to six,” said Rodriguez. \n“Our strong performance for fiscal 2015 was also driven by successful marketing and operational strategies including our very successful $5 Tuesdays and other special promotions, and our innovative Magical Movie Rewards ® loyalty program. We believe we have the formula for success and plan to continue to invest in additional theatre upgrades and enhanced amenities in the year ahead,” added Rodriguez. \nMarcus ® Hotels & Resorts \n“Marcus Hotels & Resorts achieved record revenues and increased revenue per available room (RevPAR) for both the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter and full year. Excluding the Chicago property that was undergoing a significant renovation, RevPAR was up 5.3% in the fourth quarter and 5.9% for fiscal 2015,” said Marcus. \n“Fiscal 2015 was also a record year for hotel occupancy and our properties continued to outperform their competitive set in our markets,” said Joseph Khairallah, chief operating officer of Marcus Hotels & Resorts. \n“Shortly after the end of the fiscal year, we celebrated the opening of the AC Hotel Chicago Downtown. The AC Hotel by Marriott lifestyle brand targets the millennial traveler seeking a design-led hotel in a vibrant location with high-quality service. Located in Chicago’s trendy River North area, our 226-room property is the fourth AC Hotels by Marriott to open in the U.S. With its urban-inspired feel and sleek European design, this brand is the perfect fit for Chicago,” said Khairallah. \n“We continue to move forward with our strategy to add more management contracts. We were recently selected to manage the new Capitol District Marriott hotel currently under development in Omaha, Neb. The 14-story high-rise hotel will serve as the anchor for the Capitol District, an upscale urban dining and entertainment district being developed in downtown Omaha by Shamrock Development, Inc. We will be a minority investor in the project and have provided pre-development and design programming. We will also provide technical consulting and pre-opening services during the construction phase. The hotel is scheduled to open in spring 2017,” said Khairallah. \nEarlier in the fiscal year, the division expanded its presence into Florida with a management contract and minority interest in The Hotel Zamora and Castile Restaurant in St. Pete Beach, Fla. “We are continuing to pursue additional management contracts and have a number of promising opportunities in the pipeline,” added Khairallah. \nHe said the division is also focused on expanding its food and beverage operations. “As part of this strategy, we recently purchased the Safe House, an iconic spy-themed restaurant and bar located in downtown Milwaukee, Wis. that has been popular with tourists and locals for nearly 50 years. We are currently exploring opportunities to expand this unique concept,” said Khairallah. \nReturn of Capital to Shareholders \n“We increased the quarterly cash dividend by 10.5% in the fourth quarter, our second consecutive year of increased dividend payments. Our total return to shareholders was 19.0% in fiscal 2015, bringing our four-year average total return to shareholders to 27.5%. Our strong balance sheet gives us the ability to return capital to shareholders, while at the same time continuing to invest in our two businesses and pursue potential growth opportunities,” said Douglas A. Neis, chief financial officer and treasurer of The Marcus Corporation. \nSummary \n“The year 2015 marks the 80 th anniversary of The Marcus Corporation. While much has changed during that time, our core philosophies of providing our guests with quality, service and value, maintaining a strong balance sheet and managing for the long term remain the same. We believe we are well positioned for growth in both of our businesses and look forward to continuing our momentum in the year ahead,” said Marcus. \nConference Call and Webcast \nMarcus Corporation management will hold a conference call today, July 23, 2015 at 10:00 a.m. Central/11:00 a.m. Eastern time to discuss the fourth quarter results.
