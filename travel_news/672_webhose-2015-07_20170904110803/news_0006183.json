The second edition will be held from 2 to 4 February 2016 in The Hague. TUSExpo is aimed at the fast-growing market for unmanned systems such as drones and will feature both commercial and civil applications in areas including security, agriculture, industry, science, entertainment and environmental protection. The exposition is expected to attract 2,500 international visitors. \nThe TUSExpo business platform will include a conference, trade exhibition, and matchmaking program. During the conference leading international experts from the business world, science and government will speak about the latest technologies, their applications as well as relevant legal issues. The trade exhibition and ‘live demonstration zone’ will demonstrate to visitors the possibilities offered by unmanned systems. There will also be a university zone and a unique pavilion for innovative start-ups. Recognized internationally According to Deputy Mayor Ingrid van Engelshoven (Knowledge Economy, International Affairs, Youth and Education), “It is great to see TUSExpo choose The Hague again as their conference destination. It shows that the city of The Hague and the security cluster The Hague Security Delta (HSD) are recognized internationally as the place to be for development in the field of security.” Long-term working relationship “The TUSExpo ties in perfectly with safety and security, the profile of the City of The Hague and the World Forum. We are proud to host the TUSExpo again and we intend to begin a long-term working relationship”, according to Kirsten Vosmer, World Forum Commercial Manager. Support With more than 1,500 visitors and 75 journalists covering the trade fair, the first edition of TUSExpo in February 2015 was a great success. The organisers have deliberately chosen for The Hague to also host the second edition. “The support the City of The Hague, InnovationQuarter, and security cluster The Hague Security Delta offer played an important role. These parties recognize the importance of the unmanned systems industry, which is developing rapidly not only nationally but especially also on international level.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T13:27:09.927+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
