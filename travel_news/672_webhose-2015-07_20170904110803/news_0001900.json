Tony Fernandes, group chief executive of AirAsia, took to Twitter to vent his frustration: Is this to be expected?8 hour delay due to plane slipping of chocks . The board has to take responsibility pic.twitter.com/X7EAt3jvft — Tony Fernandes (@tonyfernandes) July 27, 2015 sad that my ceo @aireenomar has to waste her time keep going to malaysia airports to sort something that should never have happened. — Tony Fernandes (@tonyfernandes) July 27, 2015 The response from malaysia airports that this is to be expected is ridiculous.The board and management need a strong hard look at themselves — Tony Fernandes (@tonyfernandes) July 27, 2015 \nMalaysia Airports told Bloomberg the settling had been anticipated. Problem areas were being patched and resurfaced and polyurethane was being injected under the ground. \nA concrete slab to be ready by April would provide a more permanent solution. \nConstruction started in 2009 on the new terminal, which is known as KLIA2 and is about 2km from Kuala Lumpur International Airport and about 50km from Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital. \nOriginally scheduled to be finished by June 2013, the 257,000sq m KLIA2, which can cater for 45 million passengers a year, was officially opened in May 2014. Construction costs increased from the original budget of 1.6 billion ringgit (NZ$633m) to 4b ringgit. \nBloomberg noted KLIA2 was not the only aviation facility in Asia to have problems. \nBangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport, built on a reclaimed swamp, had cracks in taxiways and runways and faulty baggage-scanning machines. Some taxiways had to be closed for repair and the old airport was reopened to alleviate congestion. \nIn Japan, Osaka's Kansai International Airport was found to be sinking. It was opened in 1994, after taking nearly eight years to build on a manmade island at a cost of 1.43 trillion yen (NZ$17.5b). Ad Feedback \nThe Malaysian aviation industry also took two severe blows with two plane crashes in 2014 - Malaysia Airlines flights MH370 and MH17. \n\"Since MH370, a lot of shortcomings have been found\" in Malaysia's aviation infrastructure, Shukor Yusof, founder of Singapore-based consultancy Endau Analytics, told Bloomberg. \nMark D Martin, chief executive of Dubai-based Martin Consulting said aggressive steps were needed to improve aviation standards in Asia. \nLast December, Malaysia's Transport Ministry set up a five-member audit committee to investigate the sinking and ponding problems at KLIA2. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T06:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T06:29:13.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
