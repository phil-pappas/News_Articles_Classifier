Manchester Central joins a select group of businesses who have worked with the World Class Service standard, including the Manchester Hoteliers Association, Manchester City Football Club and Manchester Airport Group, after overhauling its processes to ensure teams consistently deliver service excellence. \nThe feat comes less than a month after the industry-leading venue was accredited with the international standard for quality management, ISO 9001; making it the first major venue in the UK to reach triple ISO success. Initiatives that contributed to achieving the World Class Service Accreditation included the development of bespoke departmental standards of service and implementing a robust client feedback procedure that benchmarks service levels, allowing Manchester Central to continually strengthen its client offering in response to feedback. Angie Robinson, Chief Executive of Manchester Central, said: “Manchester Central is a world class venue and gaining this accreditation absolutely proves that our customer service is of the same calibre. We’re passionate about delivering the very best service and look forward to continuing to develop our processes to ensure total customer satisfaction.” Tracy Waddacor, Managing Director at World Class Service, said: “Manchester Central is passionate about delivering service excellence, through its processes, environment and team behaviours and has shown total commitment to the ‘Standards’ Programme. As a result, having worked closely with the business ‘Champions’ and the Management Team, we are delighted to acknowledge their dedication with the well-deserved and awarded accreditation.” Manchester Central was first awarded with ISO 20121 in 2013 and achieved ISO 14001 earlier this year.
