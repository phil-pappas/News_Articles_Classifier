(See above gallery.)\nThe lake has a decent-sized stretch of beach with lounge chairs for those who aren't comfortable thinking about what could be coming out of those waters beneath them.\nOur JAWS ON THE WATER screenings continue! #Jaws #RollingRoadshow Photo by @hlkfotos\nA photo posted by Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas (@drafthouse) on Jul 6, 2015 at 11:56am PDT\nOrganizers say the $30 ticket price includes an inner tube but guests are more than welcome to bring their own preferred floating devices.\nThere will be plenty of food and drinks for sale on site, as well as satellite bars selling beer.\nPerfect for those who want to sing along as the shark hunters bust into a boozy rendition of \"Show Me the Way to Go Home\" before that buzzkill of a great white crashes the party.\nJaws on the Water , Texas Ski Ranch. 6700 N Ih 35, New Braunfels, Texas; Saturday, July 11, 2015", "external_links": ["http://drafthouse.com/movies/jaws-on-the-water/austin", "https://player.vimeo.com/video/128203418", "https://instagram.com/p/4zjeCeh4HL/"], "published": "2015-07-07T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T17:53:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
