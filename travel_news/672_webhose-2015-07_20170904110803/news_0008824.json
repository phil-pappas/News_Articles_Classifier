MOM AND BABIES ARE AT THE HOSPITAL NOW\nPosted by Amanda Harvey on Saturday, July 25, 2015 Ms Broadway said she picked up her sons from Happiness Is a Learning Centre on Friday and found them burnt and crying in pain.\nShe said staff told her they asked the boys to keep their clothes on as the water park didn’t supply sunscreen, but they refused.\n“It was common sense that they shouldn’t have been out in the sun all day, even if they wore their clothes,” Ms Broadway told BuzzFeed.\n“The heat index was 118 degrees Fahrenheit (48C) in Vinita that day. The news was telling us not to be outside.”\nMs Broadway called a local hospital that evening who said they couldn’t do much until the burns blistered.\nBrothers hospitalised for severe burns (Frame content direct link: https://www.youtube.com/embed/nKUZaG8FmWM .)\nWhen the recommended Silvadene cream and pain medications did little to ease the pain, she took her sons to hospital the next day to have the excruciating boils and blisters lanced.\nOn Sunday, Ms Broadway rushed her boys to Hillcrest Medical Centre in Tulsa when one complained of chest pains.\n“Apparently the swelling and pain on his back was so bad that he was having pressure on his chest,” she said.\nThey were later flown to Shriners Hospital for Children in Galveston, Texas, for emergency treatment.

They’re getting better but it’s definitely taking time and it’s been really hard seeing them in so much pain and not sleeping … it’s a lot for a mum right now,” Ms Broadway said.\n“My kids need a voice — I’m that voice, and I just want justice for them. And I don’t want this to ever happen to anyone else.”\nThe day care centre has not commented publicly on the case.\nOriginally published as Brothers hospitalised for horrific sunburn", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/29/1227460/996564-c7af8210-353e-11e5-b1c6-fce245fdac3f.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/amanda.harvey.142/posts/10200927422383178", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/nKUZaG8FmWM", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/parenting/brothers-rushed-to-hospital-with-horrific-blisters-after-day-care-ran-out-of-sunscreen/story-fngqim8m-1227460996592", "http://www.buzzfeed.com/carolinekee/graphic-sunburns?bffbtrending&utm_term=4ldqphx#4ldqphx"], "published": "2015-07-29T09:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T20:14:20.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
