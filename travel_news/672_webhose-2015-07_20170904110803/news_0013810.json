By Barry Neild, CNN Updated 0410 GMT (1110 HKT) July 3, 2015 Why has the Millennium Falcon crashed in Manhattan? 8 photos Millennium Falcon in Manhattan – She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy. Except when she's nose down in the Hudson River. French graphic artist Nicolas Amiard has created a series of images blending \"Star Wars\" spacecraft into popular cityscapes. Hide Caption 1 of 8 Why has the Millennium Falcon crashed in Manhattan? 8 photos San Francisco – \"Help us Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're our only hope -- of avoiding gridlock in downtown San Fran.\" Amiard says he was inspired to create these images by a trailer for the upcoming \"Star Wars\" sequel. Hide Caption 2 of 8 Why has the Millennium Falcon crashed in Manhattan? 8 photos London – The Force is strong with this one. But the cellphone signal isn't, so better park and use a London phone box. \"'Star Wars' is an imaginary universe and bringing elements from this universe in our real world seemed to be a very interesting contrast to work on,\" Amiard tells CNN. Hide Caption 3 of 8 Why has the Millennium Falcon crashed in Manhattan? 8 photos Paris – City of Lights, or City of Lightsabers? This image shows an Imperial battleship downed over Amiard's home city, Paris. Hide Caption 4 of 8 Why has the Millennium Falcon crashed in Manhattan? 8 photos Tokyo – \"Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will.\" Wise words Yoda, but this is just an alleyway in Tokyo. Hide Caption 5 of 8 Why has the Millennium Falcon crashed in Manhattan? 8 photos Moscow – Not quite cold enough to slash open a tauntaun's belly and climb inside for warmth, but still chilly. This photo shows a ship used by Princess Padme in Moscow's Red Square. Hide Caption 6 of 8 Why has the Millennium Falcon crashed in Manhattan? 8 photos Venice – Luke Skywalker's X-wing fighter has been in murkier waters than the canals of Venice. At least Yoda was on hand to help lift it out of the swamps of Dagobah. Hide Caption 7 of 8 Why has the Millennium Falcon crashed in Manhattan? 8 photos Rio de Janeiro – \"You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.\" That's Mos Eisley Spaceport for you. Rio is much nicer. Hide Caption 8 of 8 (CNN) A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... scratch that, these photos of crash landed \"Star Wars\" spacecraft look slightly too close to home. It isn't a Jedi mind trick. It's the work of French graphic artist Nicolas Amiard, who has been using the Photoshop force to bring George Lucas's sci-fi Empire down to Earth. Amiard says a trailer for the upcoming \"Star Wars\" sequel inspired him to blend space fantasy with the reality of popular world tourist destinations. \"'Star Wars' is an imaginary universe and bringing elements from this universe in our real world seemed to be a very interesting contrast to work on,\" he tells CNN. He says he realized that adding crashed \"Star Wars\" spaceships into some of the world's biggest cityscapes could have surprising results. Paris-based Amiard, 30, used his photo manipulation skills to blend an Empire TIE fighter into a classic London street scene, complete with red telephone box. Other scenes show Han Solo's Millennium Falcon slumped against the Manhattan waterfront, nose-down in the Hudson River, an Empire Star Destroyer against the Paris skyline and a starfighter in the alleyways of Tokyo. Amiard, who usually turns his talents to advertising or television graphic artworks -- and occasional tattooing -- says he's a fan of \"Star Wars,\" but views his crash images as a one-off series. \"I have two or three other visual projects like that in mind, but there's no connection with 'Star Wars,'\" he adds. \"They're subjects which influence my life. I can't say more about that because I prefer to wait until they're completed.\" See more of Amiard's work at www.nicolasamiard.com More from CNN Travel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T17:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T06:38:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
