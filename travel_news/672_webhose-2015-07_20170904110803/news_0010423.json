The weekend I am here, all 170 rooms are booked. But I see the other guests so rarely I never get to recognise any of their faces.\n Next A Mediterranean cruise with a twirl in every port: A...

The hotel sits on 54 acres - that's vast, the equivalent of 864 tennis courts.\nThere are tennis courts too, of course, along with a golf course, a spa and a gym with personal trainers ready to whip you into shape. Even paddleboard yoga - where yoga is combined with stand-up surfing - is an option.\nA fine place to rest your head: Kate's suite was a feast of pale wood flooring and contemporary furniture\nPossibly the impetus comes after a meal at the hugely popular Ocean, one of nine restaurants at the five-star resort and the proud recipient of two Michelin stars.\nI fear I'm too unsophisticated to appreciate endless courses of 'deconstructed' food. I always want to say: 'Sorry, what is it?' I prefer the informal Adega restaurant, serving lobster and prawn rissois (the menu describes it as an 'ode to Portuguese gastronomy').\nI venture out once to take in a couple of local fishing villages - though they're not as unspoilt as you might think, with English cafe menus and Guinness logos on bar signs. So I beetle back.\nOnce you're ensconced at the Vila Vita, there's no reason to leave.\nTravel Facts: Plan your own stay in Porches Classic Collection Holidays (0800 294 9318, www.classic-collection.co.uk ) offers seven nights at Vila Vita Parc Resort & Spa from Â£1,476 per person, B&B, based on September travel and includes flights and private transfers.\nRead more: www.classic-coll...", "external_links": ["http://www.classic-collection.co.uk/", "http://dailym.ai/1GU3QfJ"], "published": "2015-07-27T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T15:10:57.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
