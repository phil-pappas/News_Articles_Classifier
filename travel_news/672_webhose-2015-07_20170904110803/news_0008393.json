Let's explore the next emerging trends. \nVideo on Your Watch \nMust Read: Warren Buffett's Top 10 Dividend Stocks \nDick Tracy was on to something. Nearly 70 years after the comic strip detective started using a two-way wrist radio (changed in the 1960s into a two-way wrist TV), Apple ( AAPL ) has taken the notion of a bleeding-edge wrist communicator and TV and reimagined it with this year's release of the Apple Watch (complete with elastomer wristband and sapphire crystal screen -- two cool features Dick Tracy probably didn't have.) \nAt last month's Worldwide Developer Conference, Apple's Kevin Lynch surprised many when he showed a couple of video clips from Vine being played on the 312 pixel-by-390 pixel Apple Watch. \nSure, this isn't as eye-catching as the science fiction magic displayed by Tom Cruise in 2002's Minority Report . Recall the \"Did you see that?\" moments in the film when Cruise's character, Police Chief John Anderton, manipulated transparent video frames with his hands, playing and stopping them at will. The recent advances in paper-thin, pliable LCD screens will have us talking about these scenarios before too long. \nBut we digress, and Lynch's demonstration signals the advent of new, smaller and more personal screens for video consumption. \nLet's be clear: You probably won't want to watch an entire episode of FOX's Wayward Pines on a small screen attached to your wrist, but you may well be watching Vine clips, short YouTube videos and social snippets from Facebook ( FB - Get Report ) and Twitter ( TWTR - Get Report ) in this fashion very soon. \nViewers of this content are speaking -- and making statements with their viewing patterns -- that their desire is to consume this variety of clips on screens of all sizes, shapes and resolutions. The message is clear then, for those who produce entertainment and those who design and deploy the workflows to deliver said clips. \nSure, Mr. Bleeding Edge, you argue, \"My phone battery is bludgeoned anytime I watch any significant amount of video. So how in the world is a device one-eighth the size of my phone that lives on my wrist going to be able to render video clips for more than 10 minutes or so?\" \nUnless Tesla ( TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk works with Tim Cook, this is a valid concern, and we likely still have a long road to travel before power consumption on wrist-based devices is sufficient to support extended viewing sessions. Further, time and viewing patterns may show that the smallish wrist-based screen isn't sufficient for watching any clip longer than three minutes. \nNevertheless, in today's selfie-driven world it's likely that a good number of consumers who embrace wearable technology will make (very) short-form video content part of their experience with these devices. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T16:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T16:41:31.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
