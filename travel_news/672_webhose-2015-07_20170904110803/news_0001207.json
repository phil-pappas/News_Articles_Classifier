This represents a year-on-year increase of 3 per cent.\nEurostar’s Business Premier passenger numbers rose 10 per cent in Q2 compared to the same period last year.\nThe company also saw sales revenues for the second quarter rise by 1.5 per cent compared with the previous year although income was hit earlier this year due to the Paris terror attacks and the closure of Eurotunnel following a lorry fire. As a result, overall sales for the first half of this year were down 2 per cent year-on-year.\nEurostar CEO Nicolas Petrovic said: “Over the last three months we have carried more passengers than in any other quarter.\n“With demand for our services at an all-time high we are looking forward to the arrival of our new trains. The combination of state-of-the-art design, unrivalled comfort and 20 per cent extra seats means that we are well placed to meet the growing demand as passengers increasingly opt for high speed rail over plane.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-07-21T18:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T19:47:50.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
