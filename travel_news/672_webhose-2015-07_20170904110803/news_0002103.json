Photographer's Note \nTwilight at the Historic Center of the city of Diamantina. Arraial do Tijuco (as Diamantina was first called) was built during the colonial era in the early 18th century. As its name suggests, Diamantina was a center of diamond mining in the 18th and 19th centuries. A well-preserved example of Brazilian Baroque architecture, Diamantina is a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1999. \nNobody has marked this note useful shaukatmi (153) 2015-07-14 10:32 \nHi, Alexandre. Nice point of view of the historic center of the city with the sky in twilight showing colors. The cobbled streets and the path leads the eye into the photograph. Thanks for sharing.

The flaming light of the sunset creates a fantastic effect. It's a very well exposed photo from a fine POV.
