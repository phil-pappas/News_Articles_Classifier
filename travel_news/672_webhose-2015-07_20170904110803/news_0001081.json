Does the weakened euro, partly the result of the fiscal crisis in Greece, affect whether you should put charges on your credit card in euros or in dollars? Is it legal and safe to use Uber in the wake of protests by taxi drivers throughout Europe, particularly in France where drivers have recently blocked roads to airports and set tires on fire? Do the International Air Transport Association’s efforts to implement more universal carry-on guidelines — a move welcomed by a number of international airlines — mean the time has come to buy a new, smaller rollaboard bag? Here’s what you need to know. Should you make charges in euros or U.S. dollars? You’re asked at a hotel or restaurant if you would like to pay in euros or dollars. What do you say? The near parity between the euro and the dollar may make it tempting to pay in the latter — but don’t. In general, always choose the currency of the place you’re in. It’s not uncommon for there to be a markup on the currency conversion rate. Even worse, if you pick your home currency you’re typically socked with a service fee known as a dynamic currency conversion fee (or DCC), which can add up to an additional 2 percent, 3 percent, even 6 percent or more, of your bill. If you didn’t ask to pay in dollars but are nonetheless charged in dollars, tell the merchant to reissue your bill in euros. (Also be sure to use a credit card such as Chase Sapphire Preferred or American Express Platinum that doesn’t charge foreign transaction fees.) Eager to pay in dollars because you want to know right then and there how much you’re spending? Resist the urge and use a currency converter app such as XE ( xe.com/apps ) instead. Do it often enough and you’ll have saved enough money for a little shopping spree. As for travelers planning to visit Greece, it’s possible there may be a few hurdles. In recent weeks some A.T.M.s ran out of cash , resulting in long lines at others. On the other hand, the dollar is strong, making the islands even more alluring to American tourists. Is it O.K. to use Uber? See More » Uber, the digital car-hailing service based in San Francisco, has clashed with regulators throughout Europe including the Netherlands, Spain, Italy and Germany. In France, the situation has been particularly incendiary. Taxi drivers have demonstrated from Paris to Marseille in protest of UberPop, Uber’s low-cost service, in some cases becoming physically violent with drivers they thought worked for Uber. Unlike France’s taxi drivers, UberPop drivers are not required to have professional chauffeur’s licenses. Indeed, the French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, called UberPop illegal. The service is currently suspended while Uber contests the law in a case pending before the French Constitutional Court. (There won’t be a resolution until the fall.) \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story In Paris I used UberX, not UberPop, before and after the recent taxi strike and demonstrations. The protests themselves were at times alarming, but rides in Uber cars afterward felt safe. While the government said it’s not legal to use UberPop, it is legal to use UberX, which in France is a black-car service that includes vehicles like a Mercedes-Benz C-Class and a Peugeot 508, as well as other forms of Uber there (like UberVan), whose drivers have professional licenses. Still, be sure to pay attention to the local news. If there are more demonstrations, you may wish to stay out of the fray by taking the Métro (or a long walk) instead. To find out if any of Uber’s services are available in the city you’re visiting, simply open the app on your smartphone. If service is available, you’ll automatically have the ability to request a car. Just be aware that in many cities in the United States there are low-cost Uber options in addition to black-car service, but in some European cities black-car service may be the only option — so expect to pay more. Do you need new carry-on luggage? In June the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents members of the airline industry, put forth industrywide guidelines for cabin baggage on aircraft with 120 or more seats. The new preferred bag size, the group said, would be 21.5 by 13.5 by 7.5 inches, smaller than the common 22-by-14 by-9-inch bags many passengers have. So much for that generously sized bag you were thinking of buying for your European adventure. A number of major international airlines expressed interest in the initiative, including the German carrier Lufthansa. Soon travelers would be able to buy these smaller carry-on bags, which would come with an “IATA Cabin OK” logo, recognizable by the airline staff during the boarding process. And wouldn’t you know it, the association said it would not make Cabin OK logo tags available to travelers with bags that already meet the guidelines. Consumers would have to shell out for new bags if they want the Cabin OK designation. Buying the bags would be voluntary, the association said. But passengers who choose not to get the new luggage could face uncertainty as to whether their bag would remain onboard a participating airline if the overhead bins were full. That’s because OK Cabin bags would theoretically be given priority to stay onboard in the event that not all carry-on bags could be accommodated. I say theoretically because, ultimately, the airline would still have the right to check any bag. In other words, there would be no absolute guarantees for anyone. Individual participating airlines could choose to implement the guidelines however they see fit, including allowing some larger bags on board. Days after the initiative was announced, however, the association said it was halting the roll out “in light of concerns expressed, primarily in North America.” Still, you would be wise not to rush out and buy one of the roomier rollaboard bags on sale in the United States right now. Flights are fuller than ever and overhead space remains at a premium. If the Cabin OK program or some newfangled version of it resumes, you could get stuck with a bag that doesn’t fit in.
