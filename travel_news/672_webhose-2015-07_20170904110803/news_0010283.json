Enough is enough. United needs to negotiate within the reality of record profits and get this merger done. It's our turn and it's past time.\" \nIn 19 cities around the world, over 2,000 Flight Attendants stood together today to send a message to management: the fight will continue until we reach a contract that we are proud to ratify. \n\"This fight is about our scope and job security. This fight is about management trying to take away profit sharing at a time of record profits. This fight is about maintaining contract provisions that survived even bankruptcy,\" said Nelson. \"This fight is about a corporate power grab and we won't stand for it. Flight Attendants have given a lot to United Airlines and we deserve a fair contract in return. Getting a contract is critical for completing the merger. United frontline workers and United passengers deserve nothing less.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T02:01:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
