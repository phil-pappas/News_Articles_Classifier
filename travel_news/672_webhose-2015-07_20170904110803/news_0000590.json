'I find it amusing that a small piece of glass between interior and exterior of a house give us the feeling of security and also the way house owners can be identified by their windows, with some being very flashy and opulent and others very humble.'\nIn the photos, the highly colourful windows of Burano, Italy, can be seen. The windows of Porto, Portugal, also feature bright colours, however there is an obvious difference between Porto and Burano, with the Porto windows featuring more tiling, alongside featuring a slightly more subdued colour palette.\nThe Lisbon-based photographer, aged 28, first began his picture project as a study on urban architectural styles.
