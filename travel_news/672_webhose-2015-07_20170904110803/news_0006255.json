But the FTC didn't require that hotels add the fee into the rate that is advertised on travel websites and elsewhere. U.S., Middle East clash over subsidies \nAn ongoing airline feud continued to boil last week over whether three Middle East-based airlines have accepted billions of dollars in subsidies from their oil-rich governments to unfairly compete against U.S. carriers. \nEmirates Airlines released a report rejecting the accusation made by American, United and Delta airlines, and fired back with the charge that the three big U.S. carriers have themselves benefited from $100 billion in government support since 2002. \nThe U.S. carriers have asked the Obama administration to investigate whether Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways have violated a so-called open skies agreement that allows foreign carriers access to U.S. markets. \nBut the feud has yet to address the effect on U.S. travelers. \nTravel experts say that competition from the Middle East airlines can mean better deals and more options for U.S. travelers, particularly vacationers heading to Europe and the Middle East. \n— Los Angeles Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T22:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T02:18:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
