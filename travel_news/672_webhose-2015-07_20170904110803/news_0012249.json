Up in the stage left circle, an opera lover decided to capture the moment by taking a snap of himself and his friend with the aid of a selfie stick, which he extended over the heads of opera-goers in front of him. \nBefore he managed to squeeze off a shot, a Sydney Opera House usher swept in and shut him down. Selfies are encouraged by Opera Australia during the interval but they can only be done at arm's length, not with a selfie stick. \nThe Sydney Opera House has joined the list of cultural institutions worldwide to crack down on the use of the telescopic camera attachment, derisively known as the \"wand of Narcissus\". \nREAD MORE: * Major attractions ban selfie sticks \nA spokeswoman for the Sydney Opera House, which was the most instagrammed site in Australia last year, confirmed taking photos during performances is prohibited. But they do permit visitors to take selfies outside the iconic building and in the foyers. \"In fact, for our summer and Vivid campaigns this year, we produced precinct maps highlighting the Opera House's best selfie spots,\" she said. \nHowever, the use of selfie sticks inside the building's performance spaces is \"strongly discouraged\". \nSelfie sticks, which allow users to capture a wider field of view with their smartphone cameras, are a common sight on the steps of the Sydney Opera House, which recently came 13th on a global list of Top Selfie Sites. (The Eiffel Tower topped the list.) \nBut worldwide, it's becoming harder to wave the wand in public. This week, Disney banned selfie sticks at all four Walt Disney World theme parks in Florida and two Disneyland parks in California, as well as theme parks in Paris and Hong Kong. The Colosseum in Rome, the Palace of Versailles near Paris and Beijing's Forbidden City are all stick-free zones. \nThe world's palaces of high culture are also wary of the wand. Cloak your stick if you want to visit London's National Gallery, New York's Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) or the Guggenheim. You can't use one in any of the 19 Smithsonian museums and galleries in the United States, or in the Art Institute of Chicago or the Getty Centre in Los Angeles. Even the Canadian Museum of Human Rights in Winnepeg has its limits. \nLocally, the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne and the National Portrait Gallery and National Gallery of Australia in Canberra have banned telescopic camera attachments. Other institutions are currently formulating their policy. Ad Feedback \nAt the moment, Sydney's Museum of Contemporary Art manages selfie-stick situations \"on a case-by-case scenario\", says the MCA's head of communications, Myriam Conrie. \n\"If the growing presence of selfie sticks in the museum were to become an issue - endangering artworks or visitors safety - we would reconsider,\" she said. \nSelfie sticks are not banned at the Art Gallery of NSW, but \"as the protection of artwork is of paramount importance, we are continually assessing their usage within the gallery,\" a spokesperson said. \"To date, there have been no incidents involving selfie sticks that have put artwork at risk.\" \nLyndon Terracini, artistic director of Opera Australia, says he is pro-selfie, as long as it doesn't irritate others. \n\"I love that people want to share their opera experience with their friends by taking selfies, with or without a stick,\" he says. \"It's a fantastic way for us to reach potential new audiences. I'm more than happy for audience members to do that before the opera begins or at interval, but not during the production when it could disturb performers or other patrons. \n\"During this year's Handa Opera on the Harbour production of Aida, we actively encouraged patrons to take selfies with the giant head of Nefertiti in the background as part of a competition. Ironically, the selfie judged best won a prize of tickets to Turandot. I wonder if it was the same person?\" \nSnap Happy! \nThe Sydney Opera House is one of the most photographed buildings in the world, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. Each year, 8.2 million people visit the site, with thousands of tourists snapping a photo of themselves and instantly posting it to social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, where there are more than 150,000 photos under #sydneyoperahouse. The Sydney Opera House was the most \"instagrammed\" site in Australia in 2014. And if you can't get your own photo, the Sydney Opera House provides endless photos on it's own Instagram account, which has more than 20,000 followers. - Sydney Morning Herald", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T10:22:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
