And with a new festival director, Dublin-born Fergus Linehan, it's all change in 2015 for the original, 68-year-old, curated multi-arts festival that spawned the gigantic monster known as the Edinburgh Fringe . Expect new ideas and some starry participants in 2015. Changes to Look Out For in 2015 \nSomethings, naturally don't change. EIF still takes over some of the grandest venues in Edinburgh for its by-invitation-only artists, productions and events. There are plenty of classical concerts and recitals, lots of theater and dance, top performers and companies from all over the world. Some of the changes this year are baby steps while some carry with them the first breezes of the winds of change. Here's what's new: New dates - The festival starts and ends a little earlier. Running from August 7 to 31, it has been coordinated with the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and The Edinburgh Book Festival so that all run concurrently and all share the electric atmosphere of August in Edinburgh. Extended runs - More of the shows are scheduled for more performances so that the word-of-mouth buzz - so important for the Fringe - has a chance to grab hold for the International Festival as well. A free outdoor opening spectacular - Not since the disappearance of the Edinburgh Cavalcade about 10 years ago, has there been a large scale, free event to open the festival. The Harmonium Project combines animated outdoor projections and a recording of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra and the Edinburgh Festival Chorus (celebrating its 50th anniversary) in John Adams choral work, Harmonium. The event takes place in Festival Square, with projections on Usher Hall, at 10:30 pm on August 7. Even if you are attending a theater or opera performance, you should have time to take in the opening spectacular afterwards. Monday fireworks - The Virgin Money Fireworks concert with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra will be moved to a Monday. The concert, one of the biggest events of its kind in the world, usually closes the festival period on a Sunday night. It has been moved to the last night of August to keep it within Edinburgh Festivals August. Pop music - For the first time, popular music has been given a place at the International Festival with Franz Ferdinand and Sparks creating a new pop supergroup, FFS for one live music concert on August 24. A welcome for the home teams - Scottish theater companies have long been overlooked - the assumption being that local audiences had already seen them. Ditto London companies. That's been corrected this year with invitations to London company Complicite , a children's theatre production from the National Theatre of Scotland and a new adaptation of a modern Scottish classic from Glasgow's Citizens Theatre. No themes - Creatively, it's a much freer festival than in past years. There are no big themes to tie the theatrical productions, concerts, dance performances and operas together. The selection committee and the festival director have cherry picked what they've seen, what they've liked and what has created a buzz in creative circles around the world to make their choices. \nThis year once again, the International Festival's terrific website includes a \"try before you buy\" feature with festival videos to sample. And here's some of what you can look forward to - In Theater: Juliette Binoche in Antigone. An international production, directed by Ivo van Hove, at the King's Theatre from August 8 to 22. Dragon , a play for children and adults from the National Theatre of Scotland, at Edinburgh's Royal Lyceum Theatre, two performances a day August 14-16. The Encounter a \"composition\" for theatre from Simon McBurney and his London based company , Complicite , at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre, August 8-23. Inspired by the book Amazon Beaming. Lanark , a \"theatrical reimagining\" of Alasdair Gray's modern Scottish epic, by David Grieg and Glasgow's Citizen Theatre. At the Royal Lyceum, August 23 -31. 887 Toronto company Ex Machina with the European premier of an experimental and visionary work by avant gard theater artist Robert Lepage. At the Edinburgh International Conference Centre, August 13-23. In Music: \nConcerts every night at Usher Hall, chamber and ensembles mornings at the Queens Hall, plus intimate performances at other venues around the city. Among the visiting orchestras and artists: Sir John Eliot Gardiner and his period-instrument Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique performing Berlioz Violinist Nicola Benedetti performing with the Oslo Symphony Orchestra Mozart's Requiem Iván Fischer and the Budapest Festival Orchestra in an all-Mozart program.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T06:09:03.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
