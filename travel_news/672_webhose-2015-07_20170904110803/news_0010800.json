Christian Charnaux (VP - IR): Thank you. Welcome to the Hilton Worldwide second quarter 2015 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the risk factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at www.Hilton worldwide.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of our second quarter results, and will describe the current operating environment, as well as the Company's outlook for the remainder of 2015. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then provide greater detail on our results and outlook. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris. Chris Nassetta (President, CEO): Thanks, Christian. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We are pleased to report another strong quarter, with adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share above the high end of our guidance. We continue to feel great about the fundamentals, which should continue to support strong performance going forward. As a result, we've raised our full-year adjusted EBITDA and EPS guidance. Given our confidence in the outlook, and the significant deleveraging we've achieved, we are also pleased to commence returning capital to shareholders with the declaration this morning of our first quarterly cash dividend. Kevin will cover this in more detail later in his remarks, but we intend to grow our dividend over time, as earnings grow, and we believe we should be able to initiate a share buyback program next year. Turning to our performance in the quarter, system-wide comp RevPAR grew 5.2% on a currency-neutral basis. May was somewhat softer than expected, largely due to weaker transient business caused by weather in the southern and central US, and demand declines across oil and gas markets, impacting quarterly RevPAR growth by approximately 100 basis points. However, transient growth for the quarter was still relatively strong, up over 5% system-wide, and strengthened significantly in June, continuing into July. Group business was strong in the quarter, as system-wide group revenue increased over 6%, at our comp owned -- Americas owned and operated hotels, largely driven by company meetings that were up over 10% in the quarter, with particular strength in the Chicago, New Orleans, and Hawaii markets. Favorable mix shifts also combined to support ancillary spend, with F&B at owned and operated hotels growing 7% in the quarter. Group position continues to track up in the mid-single digits for both the balance of this year and into 2016. We expect to see a strong second half of the year in group with the fourth quarter outpacing the third quarter, largely due to holiday shifts. Turning to development, our system growth continues to both lead the industry and gain in momentum. According to STR, we increased our industry-leading position in both pipeline and rooms under construction in the quarter. We're on track to have a record number of signings this year, roughly 90,000 rooms, continuing to grow the largest pipeline in our Company's history, all with de minimus amounts of our capital, and no acquisitions. 1 of 18", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T05:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T05:37:38.985+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
