We either expand Heathrow – creating jobs, growth, a rebalanced economy and lucrative export routes – or we do nothing and retreat as a nation. The answer is obvious, so let’s get on with it.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-07-14T18:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T22:20:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
