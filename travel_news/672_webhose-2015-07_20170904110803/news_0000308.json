Adopted by the UNWTO General Assembly in 1999 and endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly in 2001, it contains a set of principles designed to maximize the socio-economic benefits of the tourism sector while mitigating any negative impacts.\nCEHAT consists of 64 regional associations, representing hotel chains, boutique hotels and tourist apartments across Spain. By signing the commitment, CEHAT commits to promote and implement the values championed by the Code, with a special focus on social, cultural and economic issues, as well as report their implementation to the World Committee on Tourism Ethics.\nThe signing took place at UNWTO’s Madrid headquarters, and was attended by the Secretary of State for Tourism of Spain, Isabel Borrego, UNWTO Secretary-General, Taleb Rifai, and CEHAT President, Juan Molas Marcelles.\nOn the occasion, Mrs. Borrego highlighted the commitment of the Spanish tourism sector to improve social welfare and public awareness of tourism’s ability to contribute to such objectives. In this regard, she recalled tourism’s importance to Spain, where it has played a key role in economic recovery and the creation of wealth and jobs.\nMr. Rifai underscored the private sector’s key role in advancing responsible tourism: “It is with great pleasure that UNWTO welcomes CEHAT as a signatory of the Private Sector Commitment to the Global Code of Ethics. Without the private sector committing to economic, social and ethical responsibility, tourism cannot fulfill its potential as a vehicle for sustainable and inclusive development around the world, and we applaud you for taking a stand for a more ethical tourism sector”.\n“It is a pleasure and a great responsibility for CEHAT to commit to the Global Code of Ethics for Tourism promoted by UNWTO. We will certainly engage all our associate members, through their large network of hotels, in the promotion and implementation of the Code”, said Mr. Molas Marcelles.\nIn signing the Commitment, CEHAT joins 417 companies and associations from 57 countries which have signed the Private Sector Commitment to the Code of Ethics to date.\nRelated Posts INVESTOUR – creating business opportunities for Africa Int’l tourism flourishes in first third of 2014 Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium World’s 50 Most-Visited Tourist Attractions Siemens to realign regional organization and strengthen corporate units", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T20:07:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
