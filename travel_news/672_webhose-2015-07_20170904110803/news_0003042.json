Taxi firm Uber organised 140 million rides in 2014 despite not owning a single taxi or car. \n“It's about education and talking to buyers about how we can fit into this space,” said McCabe. “We have listened to a lot of feedback and have a better understanding where we can fit in the corporate sector. It's obvious travellers want to use us and we don’t want to create an issue for buyers.” \nRita Visser, director of global travel at technology data company Oracle, wants sharing economy companies to engage with them more so we can start offering it to their travellers.“When travellers can't find the right accommodation in our inventory we tell them to look again instead of going on sites like Airbnb,” said Visser. “But these are tools travellers are using in their leisure time so help us understand what we don't get.” \nAlso speaking on the panel was Serge Gojkovich, CEO at valet-sharing firm Curbstand. He said social change was driving business travellers to use companies like his, and buyers must recognise that. \n“Your travellers are going out in the world and are not just thinking about what's good for the company but what's good for the world. They are compelled to use the sharing economy because of social change.” \nAmit Patel, director of enterprise partnerships at ride-sharing company Lyft, reiterated McCabe's point by telling buyers that understanding the sharing economy is about “educating yourself, meeting with buyers, understanding your decisions, understanding the industry, and understanding the motivation”. \nMcCabe tried to allay buyers fears about safety and security issues by outlining the work Airbnb has done in dealing with this concern. “We have a whole active community that rate and review sellers similar to how Ebay operates. We are also looking to connect with TMCs and fit into that space,” he said. \nOracle's Visser had concerns around productivity and called on the buyer community to develop ideas to deal with the amount of time employees could be taking to choose from the “hundreds” of different accommodation on Airbnb.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T13:08:16.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
