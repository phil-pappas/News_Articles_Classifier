Part of Starwood Hotels & Resorts (NYSE:HOT), The Luxury Collection is investing in marquee hotel conversions and landmark renovations in diverse U.S. destinations, including Key West, Lake Tahoe, San Antonio and San Francisco, as the brand continues to grow around the world. A milestone year for the brand, The Luxury Collection is on track to surpass 100 hotels in more than 30 countries by the end of 2015. \nHotel Ivy’s transformation includes redesigned hotel guestrooms and public spaces, including a new street-level bar and lounge; Monello restaurant featuring classic coastal Italian fare; and Constantine, a subterranean bar offering a fresh twist on traditional recipes. The hotel’s new and much-anticipated dining experiences are the latest collaboration between Minneapolis’ leading hospitality companies, Wischermann Partners and Jester Concepts. \n“The renovation of Hotel Ivy reinforces the brand’s commitment to invest in our landmark hotels and to grow our global portfolio in destinations that guests are clamouring to explore,”said Hoyt H. Harper II, Global Brand Leader, The Luxury Collection Hotels & Resorts. “Once reserved for business travelers, Minneapolis has become a ‘must’ for a new generation of luxury travelers; and we are thrilled to offer an indigenous way to experience the city, as only The Luxury Collection can.” \nLuxurious Accommodations \nThe redesign of 136 luxuriously-appointed guestrooms reflects a modern sophistication, with rich fabrics and earth-toned textiles that create an exquisitely layered look. Led by The Gettys Group, Inc., the interior design brings deep together Mahogany wood furnishings with rich leather headboards, accented by metal hardware, bronze table lamps and midnight blue velvet armchairs. In each of the guestrooms and suites, crisp window treatments in varying hues of grey complement the bold geometric patterns of the custom-designed carpets. \n“Hotel Ivy is poised to offer a new lens on luxury travel in Minneapolis,” said Paul Wischermann, President, Wischermann Partners. “We look forward to welcoming discerning travelers, loyal SPG guests and the local community in to experience the redesigned hotel, home to the city’s widely-anticipated bar and new dining hotspot.” \nExquisite Epicurean Experiences \nFollowing the renovation, Hotel Ivy’s traditional lobby bar has been reimagined as an inviting, street-level lounge with plush banquettes, communal tables and a backlit marble bar. Now named Venetia , the vibrant meeting place offers small plates, global wines, and classic cocktails in a sophisticated yet relaxed setting. \nHotel Ivy has also introduced Monello , transforming its signature dining experience. Designed in a soft blue and silver color palette with mixed metals, the restaurant’s décor perfectly complements its menu, masterfully created by Executive Chef Mike “YC” DeCamp. Monello features the cuisine of Italy’s Campania region, weaving rustic simplicity with fresh ingredients with signature dishes, such as Tortelli with fava beans and pancetta alongside bold dishes, including razor clam crudo and whole rabbit (for four) with farro verde and roasted cauliflower . In addition to Monello’s house-made Limoncello, the restaurant boasts an extensive wine list and cocktail program to be enjoyed inside or outdoors on its private patio. \nTucked away downstairs from Monello, Constantine is a dimly lit, biblically-inspired cocktail bar that harkens back to the building’s legacy as a church in 1930 with a repurposed pulpit, stained glass and organ pipes incorporated into the design. The horse-shoe shaped bar sits center stage with an ever-evolving hand-crafted cocktail list curated by Head Bartender Jesse Held and Liquid Chef Jeff Erkkila. There is also a private whiskey room for twelve, which offers a daring and expansive list of whiskies from all over the world. Like its setting, Constantine’s food menu is a mix of high and low, with foie gras nachos , mortadella hot dogs and home-made pop tarts . \nHotel Ivy’s restaurant and bars were designed by ESG Architects and are owned by Jester Concepts. \nIvy Spa Club & Ivy Fitness Club \nAs the largest luxury spa in Minneapolis, The Ivy Spa Club spans 17,000-square-foot and features dedicated treatment rooms for massages, body treatments, facials and hydra-therapy as well as two luxuriously-appointed couples’ suites. The tranquil spa also offers a relaxation lounge, sauna, steam room and Jacuzzi as well as private hair and nail salons. Offering the latest in treatments and services, The Ivy Spa Club allows customized indulgence that surpasses the discerning tastes of The Luxury Collection guests. \nSituated next to the idyllic spa, Ivy Fitness Club offers guests, residents and members access to acclaimed personal trainers, high-energy classes for cardio, spin and yoga, as well as Matrix weight equipment, treadmills and elliptical machines. \nFor more information, please visit www.luxurycollection.com/hotelivy . \nAbout The Luxury Collection® Hotels & Resorts \nThe Luxury Collection® brand is comprised of world-renowned hotels and resorts offering unique, authentic experiences that evoke lasting, treasured memories.
