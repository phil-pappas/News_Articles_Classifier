Puma has now been rebranded as the Hotel Collection. More \nThe new umbrella company, whose name means “child of the moon”, will also include Lone Star’s 21 Mercure hotels, three Hilton properties and, when a deal completes on 30 July, 19 Thistle hotels. \nIt will be one of the largest hotel owners in the UK, with 8,000 employees. \nThe move comes as the attractiveness of the hotel sector has passed 2007 levels, when measured by revenue per room, and as other owners begin to leave the sector. The low-cost chain Travelodge is courting buyers while KSL Capital recently sold the Malmaison Hotel du Vin brands. In the US, the private equity group Blackstone sold 90m Hilton shares in May, cutting its stake to less than 50 per cent of the business, and Starwood has put itself up for sale. \n“The strategy is to create a branded hotels business. Many of these hotels have great locations but have not had much put into them. We have £100m to invest and renovate these hotels,” said John Brennan, the current head of Jurys Inn who will become Amaris’ chief executive. \nLone Star decided to bring together its hotels portfolio to create a simplified and more attractive business. “We want to make it simple and easy to understand,” said Mr Brennan. \nContinue reading \n“This year is about strategy. In 2016 we will do the renovation and investment; 2017 is when we should see the fruits of our labours,” he said. He added that a number of the hotels could be repositioned and that he was discussing which brands to bring into the portfolio. \nA number of the Hotel Collection properties may remain outside the group and be run as individual provincial hotels. \nGrant Hearn, the former chief executive of Travelodge, will become non-executive chairman of the new company. \n“I have been advising Lone Star for a year and we had acquired a number of these hotels beforehand. It was the acquisition of Jurys Inn that unlocked the strategy for us,” he said. “The aim is to create value by deploying capital and showing what the business is capable of. The plan is to build a business we can [float]”. \nHe added: “There is a market gap. In the UK you have InterContinental Hotels and there’s nobody else, so I think it is going to be a very interesting proposition.” \nBut Mr Brennan and Mr Hearn said Lone Star is not contemplating a quick flip. Rothschild, the investment bank, has been engaged to advise on the company’s corporate structure and not on a potential sale, they said.
