Starting in the 1960s, the area began to decline. Then came the zoning change.\n \"A lot of people went down there for the charm and ambience and set up shop in these houses,\" said Steve Sadowsky, Austin's historic preservation officer.\nToday there are more than a dozen bars and restaurants and numerous food trucks in the two-block stretch. You can find American fare (Javelina), Indian (G'Raj Mahal), Mexican (El Naranjo); food trucks serve tapas, bacon, tacos, gyros, pizza and other delicacies; for bar-hopping, you have your choice of Icenhauer's, The Blackheart, The Drafting Room, Clive Bar, Bungalow and more. Most locations have indoor and outdoor seating, some offer live music, and many are dog-friendly.\nThe anchor is Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden, with 30 house-made sausages on the menu and 104 craft beers on tap. It's the brainchild of Ben Siegel, a California native who came to Austin for college. He always wanted to open a restaurant/bar, and his life took a turn when he saw a sausage cart on Sixth Street. \"The lines were so much longer at the food cart than the regular restaurants,\" he said. \"So the idea entered my mind at that point.\"\nBanger's seats about 350, beer-garden style. Siegel could legally add another 150 seats, but the problem would be feeding them. The kitchen was designed for a 150-200-seat restaurant; Banger's now serves around 6,000 customers a week.\nBut the Rainey Street buzz made the neighborhood hot, and developers are sniffing around. High-rise condos and a 300-room hotel are under construction.\n\"It's going to be very dense,\" Sadowsky said. \"I've seen renderings of what people think it's going to look like in the future, and it's horrible. It's all high-rises.\"\nInfo: http://www.raineystbars.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-55956b2d/turbine/sc-trav-0714-strip-rainey-street-20150702"], "published": "2015-07-02T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T16:37:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
