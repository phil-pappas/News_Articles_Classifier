The day began optimistically enough, with the Knicks’ front office contingent descending on the offices of agent David Falk to make their pitch to Greg Monroe, a realistic and promising free agent target.\nBut sometime between the midnight meeting and the flight to Los Angeles, much of the enthusiasm that had been building in an organization loaded with salary-cap space was doused by reality. With Cleveland piling up pieces and spending wildly, the small market versus big market equation was turned on its head.\nOne by one, the possibilities for the Knicks were ticking off the market. Sitting and waiting for a meeting with DeAndre Jordan that was pushed back a day after a lengthy meeting with the Dallas Mavericks, Phil Jackson, Steve Mills and Derek Fisher could only look at their phone and see the plans turning to dust.\nDeMarre Carroll, Paul Millsap, Danny Green and Al-Farouq Aminu signed quickly. Stars like Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler and Kevin Love re-upped with their teams — and even targets for next summer like Anthony Davis and Damian Lillard agreed to long-term extensions.\nStill a day away from a meeting with LaMarcus Aldridge, they had to listen to chatter about Aldridge’s budding love affair with San Antonio. Adding insult to injury, Tyson Chandler, who was dumped by the Knicks last summer, signed with Phoenix and immediately joined the Suns’ representatives courting Aldridge.\nAnd Knicks rumors that began with the biggest names on the market were shifting, with word leaking out about the team making calls on the likes of Landry Fields, Willie Green, K.J. McDaniels and Jeremy Lin.\nPerhaps truer words were never spoken than when Jackson said Friday, \"There are no promises in this free agent season.\"\nThe Knicks can still dream of some uncommitted targets. While there were rumors that Aldridge had already eliminated the Lakers and was down to the Spurs and Suns, his representatives sent out a tweet insisting that no decision had been made yet, saying, \"[Aldridge] has not made any decisions yet. All reports to the contrary are false & he looks forward to sharing his plans soon.\"\nOn this first day of free agency it took little time for many of the players to commit to either their current or new teams. On the one hand, it took some of the Knicks’ prospects away, but on the other it also moved a number of teams off the market.\nMonroe remains a possibility, although he met with the Milwaukee Bucks immediately after the late-night meeting with the Knicks, and had meetings scheduled with the Lakers and Blazers. While Marc Gasol was only meeting with his current team, Memphis, the Knicks were able to get a hearing from Robin Lopez, who, like Aldridge, suddenly was willing to listen to suitors. Arron Afflalo, who played with Carmelo Anthony in Denver, was reached by phone by Anthony and scheduled to meet today with the Knicks.\nThe Knicks ended the first day still holding onto their $27 million of cap space, but finding that New York is not enough to lure the best talent anymore. The cap room also didn’t quite seem as impressive as it once had during the season, with even second-tier players landing massive deals ahead of next year’s huge jump in the salary cap.\nWith their money not overwhelming the competition, the contingent of Knicks’ reps needed to try to explain away the 17-65 debut season under Jackson and Fisher. And with few pieces in place to show as a core to a winning team, the Knicks were a hard sell.", "external_links": ["http://northjersey.mycapture.com/mycapture/lookup.asp?originalname=MC_070215_S_Knicks_30p.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-02T09:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T14:05:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
