PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 00:01, Sun, Jul 12, 2015 PH Pylewell Park in the New Forest hosts the Curious Arts Festival from Friday to Sunday \nGO TO \nPylewell Park in the New Forest will play host to the Curious Arts Festival this week, from Friday to Sunday. Some of the UK’s most celebrated authors will join comedy greats and music talent for a weekend of artistic enjoyment. The line-up includes bestsellers David Nicholls and Jojo Moyes, comedians Mark Watson and Lucy Porter, and an event curated by Gus Robertson from the band Razorlight. \nActivities include poetry workshops, life-drawing classes, a News and Views breakfast club with Radio 4’s Kirsty Lang and Curious Opera’s pre-festival production of Tosca on Thursday. A full festival ticket costs £120. Visit curiousartsfestival.com . \nVISIT \nCoronation Street fans will adore the official tour that takes you behind the scenes of the TV soap. You can wander the cobbles of Weatherfield, explore the dressing rooms and have your photo taken behind the bar at the Rovers. Tours of the Manchester-based show’s former set run until the end of the year and a family ticket costs £60. Visit coronationstreettour.co.uk . \nSEE \nArt lovers will be fascinated by the Jackson Pollock: Blind Spots exhibition, the first in more than three decades to explore the American artist’s “black pourings”. Gallery-goers can go on a journey through Pollock’s career, from his iconic drip paintings to his “pour” technique. Tickets are free for members or £10 for adults. The exhibition runs until October 18 at Tate Liverpool. Visit tate.org.uk for more information. \nEAT \nFor a true taste of Cuba, head to The Cuban restaurant and cocktail bar in Camden, London. Also located in Bristol, it offers more than 100 rums and a long list of dishes to sample and share. Mains include patacon con todo and Mojo kebabs. \nWe recommend tasting the pan-fried tiger prawns and chicken quesadillas from the tapas menu and the sensationally sweet rum cake for dessert. Enjoy evening entertainment throughout the week in Camden, from salsa classes to open-mic nights. In Bristol, try a set menu or five tapas dishes for £24. Visit thecuban.co.uk .
