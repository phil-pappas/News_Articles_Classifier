Hyde Park Hair Salon & Barbershop website \nAbout Hyde Park Hair Salon: \nHyde Park Hair Salon and Barbershop, a long standing institution on Chicago's South Side, is no stranger to celebrities sitting in their barber chair. They've cut the hair of notable names like Mohammad Ali, Spike Lee, and Chicago Bears wide receiver Devin Hester.But the big named customer that's drawing everyone's attention to the shop now is United States President Barack Obama, who was a regular for 14 years -- since way before anybody knew who he was.This has turned the barbershop into a destination spot for tourists from around the world exploring the President's Chicago neighborhood. The shop has even taken Obama's regular chair and \"retired\" it -- it sits at the side of the shop protected by a bulletproof glass partition. (If you want to get your hair cut by the same barber previously entrusted with the President's hair, ask for Zariff.)
