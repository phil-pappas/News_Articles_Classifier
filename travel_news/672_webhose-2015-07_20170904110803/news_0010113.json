But while this might be true at the beginning, as your business grows it becomes increasingly impossible to do everything yourself, and trying to do so not only ties you up in knots, it actually ends up holding the business back because you cannot be in ten places at once. The solution is to delegate some of the tasks and responsibility to other people in your team. This will not only help you in the short term – it makes sense for the longer-term health of the business. Write down every task you do each day and work out which of them can be delegated That is because if you are aiming to create a business you can ultimately sell, as opposed to simply creating a job for yourself, you should be aiming to structure the company so that it can run smoothly without your personal day-to-day involvement. The first step is to write down every task you do each day and work out which of them can be delegated. When you give the work to other people, make sure they understand clearly what they are meant to be doing. Set out a timescale and explain what you expect of them and how you will measure their performance and achievements . You should also make sure you put proper systems in place so you can see clearly how tasks are progressing and check whether they are being done in the allocated time scale. But do not micromanage. When you delegate a task, delegate the end result, not how they should achieve it. And do not interfere or hover over their shoulder. It is vital to give people the freedom to carry out tasks in the way that they feel is best. Finally, make sure that the person you are delegating work to feels that it is a reward and not a punishment. There is a fine line between dumping work on people, which obviously is going to demotivate them, and giving them work that they are going to find enjoyable and productive and could lead to promotion within the business. Alison Esse, joint managing director at change consultancy The Storytellers, says: “Every organisation needs to use delegation effectively, to share the workload and to ensure that the most appropriate person undertakes each task. “To get the best out of the people to whom a task is being delegated, they need to feel that their work is valued and that they have been selected for a good reason, whether it be for their specific area of knowledge, capability or efficiency.” She adds: “By clearly explaining how each piece of work fits into the bigger picture and how they are making a tangible difference to their own part of the business, you will increase their motivation and engagement levels. It’s also important to recognise the effort they’ve put into a piece of work, and show appreciation for what the individual has contributed.” Ms Esse says: “Allow time for further changes too. If the piece of work is not up to the required standard, don’t just go and change it all yourself: you might just as well have done it in the first place, and it will impact negatively on that person’s confidence. “It’s important to talk it through with the individual concerned to explain why it needs additional work. In this way you will help their personal development, build their confidence and give yourself further time to get on with other things.\" • Whatever your workload, the right company car financed in the best way will make running your business simpler.
