Gen. Hidayat ur Rehman visited flood-affected areas of district Chitral Adv: \nRAWALPINDI, Pakistan - Flash floods wreaked havoc with the northern valleys of Pakistan, particularly the Chitral valley where around 20,000 people have been displaced. The Pakistan Army has started rescue and relief operations. Climbers and mountaineers have also been struck in Skardu Valley and Chitral, and the Pakistan Army rescued three groups last night (Monday night) from Skardu and Chitral. Domestic tourists are also trapped in many places of Chitral Valley because of unexpected flash floods that hit this valley in middle of the domestic season. Chitral valley is out of range of monsoon rain system and heavy rain fall or sky bursting is unusual in the valley during July-August. \nGeneral Raheel Sharif, Chief of Army Staff (COAS), has directed all concerned in the Army to make all-out efforts to help and extend all possible assistance to the people affected in the flood-hit areas in Chitral and elsewhere in the country. All Corps Headquarters in their respective areas of responsibility are monitoring the flood situation and all preparations have been made to meet any eventuality arising due to expected floods. Field Commanders have been instructed to carryout reconnaissance of the area which could possibly be effected due to expected floods. \nThe Pakistan Army continued rescue operations on the 6th consecutive day in the worst flood hit areas of Chitral where Army and Frontier Corps with the help of civil administration distributed 16 tons of rations. Troops evacuated more than 73 stranded individuals from Garm Chashma, Koragh, and Bomboreet to safer places. The Pakistan Army has placed two dedicated MI-17 helicopters in Chitral for relief and rescue operations. \nFrontier Corps has donated 100 tons of rations and food items for the flood affected areas of Chitral which is being dispatched from Peshawar. \nEarlier this morning, Corps Commander Lieutenant General Hidayat ur Rehman visited various parts of flood affected areas of district Chitral and witnessed the ongoing rescue and relief operations. Sufficient army doctors and paramedical staff has been sent to establish medical camps in the flood-affected areas.
