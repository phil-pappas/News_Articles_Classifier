That was it. The money they had saved would most likely be used to buy an annuity. That annuity guaranteed a certain income, possibly index-linked for life. That was the only choice. No more. The changes to pensions that came into effect in April give us much greater flexibility to fund later life, so much so that 6 April has been called Pension Freedom Day. The key word is drawdown. From the age of 55, you can take out a quarter of your total pension fund as a tax-free cash lump sum to do with as you fancy: a holiday, a new kitchen or even the fabled Lamborghini. It’s your choice and, whatever you do, you do not pay a penny in tax to HMRC. The remainder of your money could stay invested, paying you an income. This, however, isn’t the only option. You can mix and match any of these. If you die before you have used up all your pension, you will be able to pass it on You could withdraw chunks of it when you need it, withdraw the lot at once or go back to buying an old-fashioned annuity. Here, though, as is only to be expected, comes a big “but”. After the first 25 per cent withdrawal, the rest is not tax-free. Anything you take out, you pay tax on – at your marginal rate. So the key is to be canny about when you withdraw any of the remaining 75 per cent – and how much you withdraw. Otherwise you will be making the Chancellor George Osborne a very happy man. There is another advantage in the new pension rules. If you die before you have used up all your pension, you will be able to pass it on. Pension Freedom Day means pensions are a much more flexible and exciting way to invest for your retirement. But, as ever, it is wise to speak to an independent financial adviser before making any decision.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T01:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T23:16:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
