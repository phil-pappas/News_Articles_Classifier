You may be greeted by Joe Schiffer, a Brooklyn, N.Y., native and retired Navy veteran (1951-1979) from the museum’s volunteer corps. He mans the front desk this day, reciting statistics; among them, that Camp Blanding masqueraded as Florida’s fourth largest city during its World War II training height. \n“I’m back where I started,” Schiffer said of launching his career at a Jacksonville naval base. \nHe provides other facts — Camp Blanding’s 1939 establishment as a Florida National Guard training site, carved from Clay County’s piney landscape around Lake Kingsley, a 10,000-year-old sinkhole, per assistant curator Jim Hughes. \nThen trek through a trove of artifacts, photographs, weaponry and uniforms. A battlefield Jeep hulks in one display. Newspaper clippings describe German prisoners of war held here, including one ex-POW who journeyed back decades later, for a visit. \nMost artifacts arrive via private citizens or service people with Camp Blanding ties. Eighty percent of the treasure overflowing upstairs storage came from civilians, Hughes says. But, not everything carries exterior provenance. Given Camp Blanding’s age, a recent cleanup of a base building prompted a phone call. \n“In a back corner was an old World War II teletype machine,” Hughes said of the caller’s impetus. “‘Do you want it?’ And we said yes.” \nInitially not excited — the museum has a teletype machine — he was shocked when the donation arrived. It required several men to haul it inside; a metal monstrosity. \n“It was a dog-tag machine and we don’t have one of those,” Hughes said. “That was a find.” \nOn this afternoon, he cleaned other fresh donations arrayed on a conference table — an U.S. Air Force survival blade, a cut-down World War I bayonet from 1918, a British Army bayonet and old leather covers and scabbards. A Vietnam-era bayonet looked longer, blacker and evil. \n“Sometimes it’s pretty quiet,” Hughes said of his and curator Greg Parson’s duty hours. “Then it rains and here they come.” \n“They” are retired or active military families visiting Camp Blanding’s recreation area. Boy Scout and Cub Scout troops also camp on the base. \n“They come in and the adults have this ‘help me,’ look on their faces,” said Hughes, laughing at circumstance. \nHe has the antidote. After negotiating the museum, head outside to gawk at tanks, armored troop carriers, field ambulances and airplanes. Pause at memorials honoring Camp Blanding alumni, then head east on S.R.16 toward Penney Farms , conceived in 1926 by department-store baron J. C. Penney as a retirement haven. It appears vital still, with residents zipping along oak-shaded lanes in golf carts. \nThe real jewel is Valentino’s , a tiny jewelry and antique shop tucked beside S.R. 16 on Penney Farms’ western flank. Furniture sits under an old gas-station portico. Inside are china, art and a canine greeter, jeweler Peter Nestler’s dog. Nestler’s work gleams from glass cases — gold-clad, leaf-shaped drusy quartz earrings, a pink and black tourmaline bead necklace draped over a brass monkey. \nTear yourself away and follow S.R. 16 east, to Green Cove Springs , Clay County’s easternmost jewel; a town that sprang from fresh-water springs and late 19 th - and early 20 th -century tourism along the St. John’s River. Here, the massive inland waterway forces S.R. 16 south. But first drive by the 1889 county courthouse and neighboring 1890s jail, so kids can see the mannequin in jailhouse stripes escaping an upstairs jail window. \nYour last Clay County stop is Spring Park Coffee , where S.R. 16 meets Ferris Street. Expect fresh-roasted barista treats and home-baked choices from glass cake stands. Old Victorian sofas and chairs provide generous seating. Better, burn those calories and caffeine on a hike to the St. Johns, a couple blocks away. \nThen enjoy the view. \nFor more information about Florida’s military history, visit vivaflorida.org/Explore/Victory-Florida \nIf you go… Camp Blanding Museum and Memorial Park 5629 S.R. 16 West", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T12:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T03:37:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
