Because the cut-off denim short is too entrenched to be dismissed as an aberration any longer, and once you stop fighting this, summer dressing becomes instantly easier. Like emojis and no-reservation restaurants, denim cut-offs may have seemed like a fly-by-night trend to begin with, but they have turned out to be a cornerstone of 21st-century life, so you might as well get with the programme. Especially as much holiday fashion is now designed around what works with them. Case in point: that boho, embroidered, kaftan-esque blouse you kept seeing everywhere that you tried on with a pair of trousers and looked plain frumpy. Not at all the glamorous minor-Delevingne-on-holiday look you had in mind. Try it again, with a pair of denim cut-offs. The key is to find a pair with a womanly, roomy cut – think Beyoncé, not Katy Perry – that covers your tummy button and all, repeat all, of your bottom.\n2 Replace cropped trousers with a midi-length skirt The ‘airport look’ isn’t just a thing for Victoria Beckham and Miranda Kerr. Being the best-dressed in the queue for your Ryanair flight to Perugia is a key marginal in the battle for holiday style. Not because anybody else is looking – they are all much too busy worrying about whether they unplugged the iron – but because what you are wearing here should do double-duty while you are away. You probably got up at 4am, and it will be freezing on the plane, so the above shorts are out. Last year – and the year before that, and the year before that - you wore cropped trousers. Cropped trousers, in your head, are Audrey Hepburn in Sabrina. In reality, and especially when you’ve got a Daunt Books holdall over your shoulder with sticker books in it, they are more, I’m going on a less glamorous holiday than I would like to be. So here’s what we’re going to do: we are going to wear a midi skirt, instead. (Think Audrey, but in Roman Holiday, this time.) Covering the knee, full-skirted. Does the same job, and can then multi-task in style, and make going out for ice-creams in the piazza more elegant than it would be.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ghillies - very elegent, very now Photograph: PR 3 Take only flat shoes High heels are a useful crutch to keep your head above water out there in the big, bad world. But the whole point of a holiday is that it is two weeks off dealing with the big bad world, and in a season with more dreamy flat-shoe options than ever, even a die-hard like me can see that heels are no longer necessary for style points. Do not be tempted to take a two-inch wedge espadrille as a sort of weaning device: a flat is much, much more chic. And for those of us who have loads of clothes that we only feel confident wearing with high heels, a flats-only packing rule not only frees up space, but magically simplifies your options. If a dress is too insecurity-baring to be worn without a five-inch leg-up, it has no place on holiday. The fashion content in this year’s shoe wardrobe comes from a pair of Ghillies – it’s a dancing-shoe, a ballet flat with laces, very elegant, very now. Wear it at the airport with the above midi-skirt. You also need a chunky daytime pair of sandals, a Birkenstock or slider style that you can slip on and kick off.\nRelated: Ten of the best midi skirts for summer – in pictures\n4 Pick a lane The temptation, because you only get a summer holiday once a year, is to go through your wardrobe pulling out everything that’s pretty and doesn’t make you sweat. Then you wind up marooned in the middle of nowhere trying to make a coherent outfit out of two sheer spaghetti strapped maxis, a kimono-sleeved floral silk jacket and a pair of culottes. I’m not saying you have to be, like, “I’m channelling modern androgyny in neutrals with pops of colour,” because no actual human beings do that, not even fashion editors, but – well, pick a lane, basically. It can be based around what looks good on you – think Taylor Swift in high-waisted shorts and a cropped top – or on a colour scheme that works. Keep it simple and then pick the strongest pieces in that category, the ones that you will still be into even after being hand washed in the sink and hung to dry on the balcony.\n5 Do not look at bikinis on anyone’s body but your own To be specific, do not take any notice whatsoever of those adverts for cheap bikinis modelled by supermodels. “Bikini, £9.99”, it says. Body, price upon application, to winner of genetic lottery only. Find a swimwear brand that works for you, and stick with it. I buy bikinis at Heidi Klein, because they are flattering without being too obviously upholstered, and although they are expensive they last for years, which is essential, because you can’t choose a bikini by looking at pictures in a magazine and no one in their right mind wants to spend more time than they absolutely have to climbing in and out of plastic-lined knickers, periodically panicking that the door isn’t locked.\nRelated: Ten of the best black items for summer – in pictures\n6 Your bikini cover up is the most important piece in your suitcase Actually, it is way too important to go in the suitcase. I take my bikini and my favourite throwover dress in my carry-on tote, along with my passport and sunglasses, because frankly, if I lost everything else en route, I wouldn’t be remotely bothered. If your bikini cover-up is an oversized T-shirt, consider an upgrade. This does not mean taking that nice gingham shirt dress you’ve been wearing to the office. It means a pair of cut-off dungarees or an apron-front denim dress (try Topshop) or a sheer, fringed kaftan or kimono from Dancing Leopard. The best poolside cover-ups are unashamedly fit for no other purpose than lounging around.\n7 Wear black The skimpier the clothes, the better they look in black. This is as true for poolside at 10am as it is for New Year’s Eve. See: Angelina Jolie in a black maxi dress, Rihanna in a black strappy vest, and Julia Restoin-Roitfeld in black boho.
