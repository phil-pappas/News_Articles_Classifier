It passes into its savanna like central regions where wine is famously produced, and is pretty cheap throughout the country. To the south where Patagonia starts where we are focusing on the lake region , which has roughly 8 large lakes of which Llanqhue is the largest. It is flanked by three volcanoes the majestic Osorno, Puntiagudo and the explosive Calbuco. \nThe latter is well known for recently erupting in spectacular fashion in March 2015. While it's since long faded from headlines the most affected area of Ensenada is still covered in ashes and small stones. \nLlanqhue lake sits at the foot of the Andes mountain range mostly surrounded by farm land and a few small towns Ensenada, Frutillar, Puert Octay and Puerto Varas. There is a lot to do in the region for travelers, such as skiing down Volcano Osorno , taking in it dramatic views of the lakes below, river rafting down Petrohue, visiting the cascades of Petrohue or horseback riding through the forests around volcano Calbuco. This region is also famous for its fly fishing, fisherman from around the world flock to catch one of the legendary salmon that spawn in the rivers. \nPuerto Varas is a great place to find accommodation to explore the area. Puerto Varas is also ideally located for those who want to explorer Chiloe island 2 hours away by car and a ferry ride over the ocean that runs all night. It's also the starting hub for those who are preparing to travel \"route austral\" 1000km road that is famous for its beauty, huge glaciers, crystal blue lakes and rivers, adventurous road no wonder the owner of the north face brand has a reserve here \"Parke Pumaling\". \nOne of the best cabins in town or locally known as \"cabañas\", is Bordemundo there are great views of the lake and volcanos Osorno and Calbuco. There is a hearty breakfast to get going in the morning. There is also a beach front on the lake and a lot of animals on the land for the family to enjoy peafowl, sheep, ducks, chickens. Wifi exists in all cabins along with wood fireplaces to give that wonderful family experience or romantic getaway. \nThere are other options around the fish market of Angelmo, the casino or the outlandish museum of \"Museo Pablo Fierro\". All in all the lake region and Puerto Varas is a must for anybody visiting Chile, seeking the adventure or simply wanting to get away. \nThe lakes are full of mysteries most originating from the local Indians that originally settled the area \"Mapuche\". Lincayarén and Quitralpique a couple in love of Mapuche tribe. But an evil spirit of an ancient warlock burned with envy of the young couple. His anger led to the eruption of the volcano, where he lived. The ground was tinted with ash and the mountain red. Lincayarén had to sacrifice her self which she accepted to keep her people safe. Quitralpique holding the tears pierced her chest and took her heart with a branch of Canelo, there a condor flew swiftly down and ate the heart. \nAnd with the cinnamon stick in its beak it flew into the crater of the Osorno Volcano and dropped the branch, immediately for days snow fell relentlessly. The melted snow ran down the Osorno and Calbuco volcanoes, until its surroundings were full of water, creating the Llanquihue Lake.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T01:51:02.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
