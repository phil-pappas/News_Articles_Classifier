In my opinion, Brad Haddin and Shane Watson should have gone 18 months ago. The 5-0 thrashing of England in January 2014 could have been their swansong. Watson keeps getting out lbw the same way so many times it is just ridiculous . All of us have faults from time to time, but we then work at putting them right. Watson has the same fault that Alastair Cook had when he was out of nick last year. Alastair was putting his foot on the line of the ball and was then having to play around his pad, not down the line of the ball. However Alastair was smart enough to solve it, and is now playing fantastically well. Watson should have solved his problem ages ago. Brad Haddin leaves Lord's after being withdrawn from the second Test Australia had a history of giving youth a chance. It is a young country that traditionally promoted young sportsmen. But before the Australians arrived, we had a former Australian cricketer in Jason Gillespie – not known for outspoken comments – calling this Australian team “Dad’s Army” . That says it all. Every sporting team has to keep on evolving, which means every now and then having an injection of youth is vital. They haven’t done that, have they? Haddin may have been left out of the Lord’s Test for personal reasons , but he had a poor performance at Cardiff, and wicket-keeping mistakes usually cost teams the match. Haddin dropping Joe Root when he was on nought was a clanger. It was not that difficult a chance, because he could see the ball all the way off the outside edge. Had he caught it, England would have been 43 for four. That was the game-changing moment. Shane Watson was out leg-before again to England Keepers can’t afford mistakes, because they wear two big gloves to catch the ball, and their performance behind the stumps can lift the bowlers or deflate them. It is not about how many dismissals they take in terms of figures, it is how many they miss. Why? Because a keeper is dependent on the quality of bowling for his nicks and stumpings. If the bowlers don’t create many chances, a keeper won’t have good statistics. Great keepers make it look so easy, as if the ball is disappearing down a velvet hole. Alan Knott was a genius because he missed so few opportunities. Brad Haddin, on the other hand, does not have good footwork; he moves late, and grabs at the ball. He also dropped Root at Lord’s in 2013 , when Root scored 180, and England won the match by 347 runs. Modern-day teams all go for batsmen-keepers to lengthen and protect the batting order. I understand that, because I have always maintained that a team needs runs on the board to put them in a position to win, and give the bowlers a good total to bowl at. But if you go down the route of batsmen-keepers, from time to time it will hurt you. For example, Jos Buttler is a fantastic, thrilling stroke-player, but a very ordinary wicket-keeper. In the recent third Test at Barbados, when West Indies were 87 for four in their second innings with the match finely balanced, he missed a stumping off Moeen Ali when Jermaine Blackwood was on 4. Blackwood was that far down the pitch, Buttler could have run him out, never mind stumped him. But he made such a mess of it, and Blackwood went on to score 47 not out, helping Darren Bravo win the match. Haddin discusses his situation with Australia coach Darren Lehmann For years now, the Lord’s pitch has been a fantastically fair cricket surface for everyone. Batsmen can play shots and trust the bounce. It should be more helpful to the bowlers, and have more pace, than Cardiff. The 8ft 8in slope from the Grand Stand to the Mound and Tavern Stands means the bowlers have a tilted pitch to help them move the ball down the incline from either end. The English red Duke ball moves more than the Australian Kookaburra, so there is an opportunity for either team to take 20 wickets. If Australia are to win, then Michael Clarke has to get his tactics and field placings spot on. Much better than he did in Cardiff . Bombing England batsmen with the short ball does not work as easily here as it did in Australia. Also, setting attacking fields all the time and leaving lots of gaps for England to score at four an over means you lose control of the game very quickly, and sometimes when the opposition are on a roll, it is hard – very hard – to get it back again. Taking wickets is always paramount, but if you aren’t getting wickets, and you lose control, then you will lose the match. Alastair Cook catches during fielding practice at Lord's Jimmy Anderson says after the Cardiff win England went to have a beer with the Aussies and Clarke rebuffed them . I wouldn’t have asked them in the first place. My view was always, winners can smile and the losers can please their bloody selves. What it does show is they are rattled. England are brimming full of confidence, and barring injuries, will play the same team. The only thing they have to guard against is overconfidence. Nothing wrong with trying to bat positively, but use some common sense as well. Cook and Ballance are at their best batting for long periods and wearing down the opposition bowlers. Asking them to go on the attack is a recipe for getting out. It’s not their style. For the rest of our batsmen, they must play their natural game, and not go “gung-ho”. England just need to use their brains, and we may just win again.
