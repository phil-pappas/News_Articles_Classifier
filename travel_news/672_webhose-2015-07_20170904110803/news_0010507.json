Thanks to a new agreement between National Commercial Data Services (NCDS) Anguilla and regional telecommunications provider Digicel, Summer Festival revelers will benefit from complimentary wireless internet access. This inaugural service provides coverage in the heavily trafficked areas between the Landsome Bowl Cultural Center and The Valley Food Court now through to August 15, 2015. \n“We are elated by this announcement as the provision of this wireless service will allow both visitors and residents alike to share audio, video and photographs of all the fun-filled Summer Festival activities with their family and friends. By extension, that allows us to showcase an important aspect of Anguilla’s culture and heritage to the rest of the world using preferred social media platforms like Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram and Vimeo,” said Anguilla’s Director of Tourism Candis Niles. \nA 10 day culture- and heritage-based celebration, the annual Anguilla Summer Festival is a carnival-styled event with non-stop action that features exciting boat racing competitions by day and traditional carnival activities by night. The highlight of the week is the Caribbean’s biggest beach party on August Monday to commemorate Emancipation Day. It features J’ouvert Morning street dancing, boatracing and main stage music performances against the backdrop of one of Anguilla’s gorgeous beaches, Sandy Ground. \nThis is the 75th year that boatracing has been officially recognized as an organized event and national sport in Anguilla. To commemorate this Diamond Jubilee celebration, 18 boatraces were coordinated throughout the year and the “Champion of Champions” race is scheduled to be held on August 9. \nFree and ongoing wireless service also is available at the Clayton J Lloyd International Airport and at Blowing Point ferry terminal through another telecommunications provider, LIME.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T18:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T22:27:20.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
