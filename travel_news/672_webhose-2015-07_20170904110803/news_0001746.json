In 2014, the free event drew a record crowd of over 130,000 people and was televised nationally as part of ABC’s Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve international broadcast.\nComprised of three Followill brothers - Caleb (guitar), Nathan (drums), and Jared (bass), as well as first cousin Matthew Followill (guitar) - Kings of Leon formed in 2000. Oklahoma natives, the Followill siblings spent much of their youth traveling to churches across the South with their mother and father, a Pentecostal preacher.\nKings of Leon’s debut album \"Youth and Young Manhood\" was released in 2003 and became an immediate sensation in the UK and Ireland, where NME declared it \"one of the best debut albums of the last 10 years\" and The Guardian described the band as \"the kind of authentic, hairy rebels The Rolling Stones longed to be\". The group achieved opening spots for U2, Pearl Jam and Bob Dylan after the release of their sophomore album, \"Aha Shake Heartbreak.\"\n In 2008, the group released \"Only By The Night,\" the record that catapulted the band into the mainstream. The multi-platinum-selling album debuted in the Top 5 on the Billboard Top 200 chart, hit No. 1 in five countries, sold more than 6.5 million copies worldwide, and earned Kings of Leon three Grammy Awards, including wins for their Modern Rock radio multi-week No. 1’s \"Sex on Fire\" and \"Use Somebody\".\nKings of Leon got their start in Nashville by playing open mic nights, songwriters’ nights and booking gigs at local songwriter hot spots like the Bluebird Café. Members collaborated with other Nashville songwriters – most notably Angelo Petraglia – who helped them hone in on their unique rock & roll sound. While Kings of Leon continues to record and tour worldwide, each member calls Nashville home\n\"The Kings’ following internationally is beyond impressive – no doubt they are one of the biggest rock bands in the world right now,” said Butch Spyridon, president and CEO of the NCVC “Not only are they great musicians, but they love Nashville and are great ambassadors for us. We are honored to have them play their hometown and know it takes our event to a new level in terms of reach and expectations.”\nWhile the crowd size will not be confirmed until the conclusion of the event, the NCVC is logistically planning for 150,000 fans on Broadway, the largest crowd size ever for a Nashville concert and the largest Music City New Year’s Eve event to date.\nThis is not the first time the NCVC has partnered with the band to assist in promoting Nashville. In February, the organization partnered with the band to play a concert at the Schermerhorn Symphony Center in conjunction with the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit launch. The concert was an immediate sell out, and was viewed by more than 75,000 people via its livestream on the web.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T03:30:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
