It is not the only motor of it but it is one of the very important origins.” \nMeanwhile the Tunisian prime minister Habib Essid said he would phone David Cameron today to tell him the change in FCO advice would “have repercussions”. \nHe added: “We will ring the British prime minister to tell him we have done everything we can to protect all British interests and those of others countries - that’s our duty. \n“Britain is free to take whatever decision it likes - it’s a sovereign country - but we too are a sovereign country and we have a position to take.” \nThe change of advice is the latest problem to hit the country in the wake of the terrorist attack two weeks ago which saw 38 tourists killed, of which 30 were British, in Sousse before the gunman was killed by the authorities.

I don't think tourism is on their agenda.It just happens that the decline of tourism in Tunisia is an unfortunate side effect.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T14:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T15:46:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
