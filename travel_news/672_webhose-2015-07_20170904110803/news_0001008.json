(AP) - The Vermont Law School library is providing legal reference services to the public, seeking to fill the gap created with the closure of the state library's law program in Montpelier.\nThe Julien and Virginia Cornell Library at the South Royalton school is offering a new \"Ask a Law Librarian Line\" at 802-831-1313 for reference requests by phone. It's also offering a new Community Legal Information Corner with two public-access computers with Westlaw, an online legal research service, and a legal self-help collection.\nThe library submitted a proposal to the state last spring, and the Legislature subsequently approved a $67,000 grant to offset the costs associated with school opening its library doors to the public.\nThe 35,000-square-foot library overlooks the White River.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
