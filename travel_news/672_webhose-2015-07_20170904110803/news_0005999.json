Last summer, more than 70,000 postcards were sent to more than 100 countries. That’s up from 50,000 the year before.\nAfter having Antarctic stamps stuck on them and then slipped into the red British letterbox on the wall, the postcards are removed and franked with their special British Antarctic Territory mark. Then the journey begins.\nWhile many of the people who posted them will finish their Antarctic journey in Ushuaia, on the southern tip of Argentina, the postcards need to hitch a ride on ships that are heading to the Falkland Islands.\nFrom the Falklands they are either loaded on to an RAF military plane or a commercial cargo plane and flown to RAF Brize Norton in the UK. At this point, they enter the British postal system and start to make their way around the world.\nIt may be a roundabout journey from Antarctica to Australia, but the well-travelled postcards I sent arrived exactly seven weeks later.\nThe Penguin Post Office is also packed with souvenirs, including an Antarctic tartan comprised of the colours of the snow, sea, ice, rocks and wildlife. I couldn’t leave without a crocheted snowflake, paid for with my credit card so that I could smile when Antarctica appeared on my statement.\nOnly four people work at Port Lockroy and this year saw a huge surge in job applications. More than 2400 people from 75 countries applied for the chance to spend five months on an island the size of a football pitch in Antarctica. That’s compared to 82 applicants last year. While the job may be demanding with long hours in the post office combined with monitoring the impact visitors are having on penguins and other wildlife, employees say they feel honoured to have had the experience.\nTo live in a historic site and discover your own strength and character among harsh conditions in a beautiful environment? That’s more than a postcard moment.\nThe writer travelled as a guest of One Ocean Expeditions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T19:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T09:53:06.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
