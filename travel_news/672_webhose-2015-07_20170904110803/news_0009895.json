I was sitting on the ground floor of the Kaufhaus Goerlitz, a 1913 masterpiece of Historicism on the An der Frauenkirche and the building that provided the cavernous interiors for those memorable lobby scenes in Anderson’s 2014 film The Grand Budapest Hotel .\nRalph Fiennes, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, they were all right here, filming from November 2012 to March 2013. And now I was here – two years too late, sure, but no less exhilarating as lines like “Why do you want to be a Lobby Boy?” and “She’s been murdered ... and you think I did it”, faintly echoed about me. Costumed extras scurrying, clapboards snapping. “And ... action!”\nGoerlitz is, by its own admission, “the most beautiful city in Germany”. I wouldn’t dare argue it. Spared the ravages of World War II, it was again left largely untouched in the decades that followed thanks to a cash-strapped East German government that couldn’t afford to do to it what it wanted to in the early 1980s – rip up its neighbourhoods of “cold, ageing buildings” with their frayed wiring and bad plumbing, and start over with smaller, functional Soviet-era apartments which, while truly ugly, were at least affordable and functional. Filmmakers love Goerlitz’s streetscapes, untouched by modernity. Source: Supplied\nIn the end, its 4000 historically listed buildings – from Baroque and Gothic to Historicism and Art Nouveau – survived the German Democratic Republic’s “town planners” and now represent a density of lavishly restored buildings without equal in Germany, with examples too numerous to mention.\nHowever, what must not be missed is an antiquarian library housed in the 17th-century Barockhaus at #30 Neissstrasse, with more than 100,000 books and manuscripts dating to the Middle Ages, and next to it the Museumsleitung Archaologie, as great a museum devoted to science and archeology as I’ve ever seen. “I only wish we had more visitors”, its director, Dr Jasper von Richtofen confided. A descendant of Baron von Richtofen himself, World War I’s Red Baron no less, he laments Goerlitz’s relative isolation and the impact that has on visitor numbers. So go see it.\nTo better understand Goerlitz, cross the Altstadtbrucke into Zgorzelec, a suburb of Goerlitz until national boundaries were redrawn after the defeat of Nazi Germany. Sadly Zgorzelec – more tied to Goerlitz than Goerlitz is to it – has not fared well under Polish rule. Cigarettes may be cheaper there, and pizzas and vodka too, but living standards are poor and there is no mistaking the disparity in living standards one can plainly see along the eastern banks of the Neisse.\nGoerlitz’s labyrinth of streets and alleyways were used to great effect by Anderson in GBH and are of themselves not an uncommon sight in Europe. What makes Goerlitz unique, though, is its vast untouched swathe of 17th, 18th and 19th-century neighbourhoods that fan out from its 15th and 16th-century cobblestoned heart.\nFilmmakers love coming here because its broad avenues and streetscapes effectively double for Prague, Paris, even pre-war Berlin, yet at a fraction of the production costs. Actors love it because of the almost complete absence of meddlesome paparazzi, and a rare degree of anonymity.\nDuring the filming of GBH, Jeff Goldblum was often seen playing piano unmolested at the restaurant Lucie Schulte. Jude Law went jogging every morning. Owen Wilson tried getting into a local punk club but wasn’t recognised and turned away. Bill Murray would walk around the corner from the Hotel Boerse to Senfladen’s for their Thuringian bratwurst sausages with mustard, gherkin, and extra spices.

I know this because she walked right by me. “Hi Emma” I said, and she looked at me, smiled like I was an old friend, and said hi back. That afternoon I saw her cycling through the Old Town without a care in the world.\nOn my last day, while struggling through a poppyseed cake in the courtyard of the Cafehaus Lucullus I met Sebastien, an extra in a kitchen scene playing a cook opposite the US actor Bob Balaban. Now he has an agent. “Because I am on their books I jumped the queue that went around the block when the call went out for extras for Alone in Berlin ”.\nNo wonder people are starting to call it “Goerliwood”. You can even buy the T-shirts. It seemed everyone had been caught up in the glow of the spotlights. Sitting there, covered in the dust of the Kaufhaus Goerlitz, so had I.\nGO2\nGOERLITZ\nGETTING THERE\nLufthansa flies to Frankurt via Singapore ( lufthansa.com ).
