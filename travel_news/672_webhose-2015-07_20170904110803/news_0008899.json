Other plans include major upgrades of two lifts, new and improved restaurants and better snowmaking.\nThe projects are expected to be ready by the 2015-2016 ski season.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T11:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T22:02:09.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
