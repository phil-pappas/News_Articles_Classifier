It will be packed, full of drink and tapas (sometimes free).\n* El baile (the dance): each night, from late and often until dawn, there's dancing. A group of singers accompanied by musicians (or pre-recorded music) plays a mix of traditional and popular songs. Everyone gets involved.\n* La iglesia (the church): at some point there will be a Mass, a procession, or walk to a local shrine.
