An arrow pointed into the woods.\nI was part of a hodgepodge group that included two young Dutch backpackers and a physical education teacher from Spain, united by the need to split the cost of a guide. We already knew that the death rituals of the Torajan people of South Sulawesi, Indonesia , were unusual and elaborate. That morning we had watched 17 water buffalo sacrificed at a village funeral as a wooden effigy of the deceased — a woman who had died more than two decades earlier — looked on from above. Next to the effigy was a coffin containing her preserved body; according to Torajan beliefs, until the funeral she had merely been “sick,” and her body had continued to stay in the house as a member of the family. (For a primer on the Torajan perspective on death, watch this TED Talk by Kelli Swazey, an anthropologist married to a Torajan.)\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage Frugal Traveler: A Visit to Padang, Indonesia’s Food Paradise, During Ramadan JULY 23, 2015 The spectacle of the funeral notwithstanding, I found the baby’s grave more astonishing. Our guide, Pery Nani, a Torajan but a bit of a wanderer who for years worked as a guide in Papua, led us to the “pohon tarra,” or breadfruit tree, which had scattered rectangles of palm fiber nailed with wooden pegs into the trunk. When a baby dies before teething, Mr. Nani explained, the family forgoes the normal funeral ritual, and goes to the tree at night by torchlight. They carve a hole in the side of the tree, place the baby’s body in vertically, and cover it with palm fiber. By the time the fiber cover falls off years later, the tree has regrown and absorbed the skeleton.\nPhoto A tongkonan, the traditional ancestral home of the Torajans. Credit Andy Haslam for The New York Times As proof (for it’s hard not to be skeptical) Mr. Nani then showed us the marks of pegs that have long fallen out of the tree. He also noted that, unlike the funeral rituals we had seen earlier, only a small percentage of Torajans still bury babies this way. (Ms. Swazey told me by email that in her experience the practice no longer exists.)\nA young man appeared seemingly out of nowhere to collect 20,000 rupiah from each of us, $1.53 at 13,031 rupiah to the dollar — a representation of both the commercialization and affordability of seeing Torajan culture close-up.\nDeath rituals are what the Torajans are known for, and why travelers go to Tana Toraja, or the Land of Toraja. Those on a budget take a very comfortable, 185,000-rupiah overnight bus from Makassar, the nearest major city, which is what I did after flying in from Sumatra . The visitors (not exactly hordes, at least in early July, when I went) find amazingly cheap hotels. My companions had all stumbled off the same bus into Pia’s Poppies hotel, where surprisingly comfortable, slightly quirky rooms were found just past a lovely garden, with plentiful poppies, and cost 154,000 rupiah for a double; 132,000 for a single. (That is almost precisely $10, which would not even get you a bed in a youth hostel in much of the world.)\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story The room was easy to find; it was harder choosing a guide, few of whom have websites. I found Mr. Nani by reading informal reviews on Lonely Planet’s Thorn Tree Forum and then contacting guides by email and text message. Mr. Nani was responsive and responsible and his English excellent — as my Dutch and Spanish friends agreed when we all met him the morning of our arrival.\nFrugal Traveler Tips for how to navigate the world on a tight budget.
