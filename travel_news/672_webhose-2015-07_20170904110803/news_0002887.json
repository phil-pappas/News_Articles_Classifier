Together, the two lines form the Singapore Cable Car Sky Network. \n\nThe new line is one of several infrastructural enhancements that Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) has embarked on to improve connectivity and accessibility on the island. \n\n“It (the new cable car ride) offers a serene ride over our beautiful island, while also greatly improving access between Merlion Plaza, Mount Imbiah and Siloso Point,” said Mike Barclay, CEO of SDC. \n\n“We expect it will become the preferred mode of transport for our guests wishing to access the western tip of Siloso Beach, as well as the Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa Hotel, Underwater World Singapore and Fort Siloso,” he added. \n\nGuests who wish to ride on both lines are able to buy a Cable Car Sky Pass with an option to top up for unlimited rides. Overseas guests will enjoy a bonus as the new Sentosa Line will be included in the new Standard Sky Pass with no increase from the current price of $29 (US$21.20). \n\nAs part of Sentosa’s SG50 celebrations, rides on the Singapore Cable Car Sky Network will be free for Singaporeans and local residents from 9am to 9pm on August 10.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T11:14:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
