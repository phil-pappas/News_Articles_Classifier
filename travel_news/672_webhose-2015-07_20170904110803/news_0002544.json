Weight of expectation: the savoury-laden table Sweet and savoury were beautifully laid out, with a menu including pork pies and haslet (a large pork meat loaf, which is a traditional Lincolnshire dish), both from the local butcher Muntons – which has family members playing at the club; roast beef, cheese and pickle, and honey roast ham sandwiches made with home-made bread; honey-mustard sausages; sausage rolls; gravadlax; and a huge cheese board. Have your cake: cricket ball, left, and hummingbird, right Then there were the cakes. The humming-bird cake, made by Allyson Percival-Carter, had won Uffington’s very own bake off fundraising event. But there was so much more: a cricket ball cake that had been made by Shelly Burton; cheesecake; Victoria sponge; lemon drizzle cake; and scones – all enjoyed with an urn full of Yorkshire Tea.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T11:26:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
