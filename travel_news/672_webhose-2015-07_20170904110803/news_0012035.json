Wednesday 29 July 2015. Cloverhill Prison Inmate disruption. 30 July 2015 08:47 AM\nA major security operation was launched in the wake of the incident, leading to the lock-down of the adjacent Wheatfield Prison and the deployment of extra prison officers to Cloverhill.\nThe operation also saw the diversion of fire services and ambulance personnel to the prison – services no doubt badly needed in other parts of the city.\nAll this for a group of inmates who enjoy, by any standards, the best of facilities while they are held on remand.\nPrisoners at Cloverhill enjoy good food, top medical treatment, gym and entertainment facilities, all funded by the hard-pressed taxpayer. It’s difficult then to see what conditions they could protest about.\nThe ringleaders of yesterday’s disturbances should face charges. A message must be sent out that such chaos will not be tolerated.\nStreets for kids plan is welcome Proposals to block off a roadway in Dublin to make space for children to play is welcome.\nToo often nowadays we read of surveys indicating that children are spending disproportionate amounts of time indoors, in front of screens.\nWith the exception of brief periods of PE at school some children get very little playtime outdoors.\nThis is not their parents’ fault. In our increasingly congested capital city parents are rightly concerned about their children playing in built-up areas close to busy roads.\nThe Dublin City Council plan would see parts of Donnycarney blocked off and given over to children to play.\nThis would be an excellent way of reclaiming the streets for youngsters and giving them a taste of street games that they parents and grandparents enjoyed.", "external_links": ["http://www.independent.ie/incoming/article31414735.ece/dc5d6/ALTERNATES/h342/CH7.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-30T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:02:30.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
