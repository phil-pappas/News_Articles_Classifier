This information is from MAS (Malaysia Airlines). They have informed me,” Deputy Transport Minister Abdul Aziz Kaprawi told AFP. \nThe wing component found on the French island of La Reunion bears the part number “657 BB”, according to photos of the debris. \nFAMILIES REACT TO THE NEWS: ‘I selfishly hope this is not MH370’ Confirmed ...
