Guests can meet \"Star Wars\" heroes and villains while checking out sets and props from the sci-fi saga.\nThere will also be a cinematic Skywalker experience.\nAt Marvel Universe, guests can attend a \"mission briefing\" and meet the likes of Iron Man and Spider-man.\nThere will also be new additions to the six classic themed lands that Disney diehards have come to expect in a park.\nFantasyland will feature a new version of the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and the Voyage to the Crystal Grotto ride, which will run underneath the iconic Enchanted Storybook Castle.\nAs for the castle, it will be bigger than the ones in all of Disney's other theme parks and the first to include all of the brand's beloved princesses.\nTomorrowland will house a new Buzz Lightyear attraction, a jet pack simulator and a fast-paced \"Tron\" coaster, on which visitors ride futuristic two-wheeled \"Lightcycles\" under a massive color-shifting canopy.\nThere will also be a new pirate-themed attraction in Treasure Cove.\nShanghai Disneyland also promises to offer the world's longest parade route of all the Disney parks, as well as the most collectibles and gifts.\nAppealing to local Chinese visitors\nLike other Disney parks, Shanghai's version will have a classic 420-room Shanghai Disneyland Hotel as well as an 800-room Toy Story Hotel.\nDisneytown, next to the amusement park, will be a shopping, dining and entertainment district with the Walt Disney Grand Theater, which will feature the world's first Mandarin version of the musical, \"The Lion King.\"\nThe town will incorporate Shanghai's traditional Shikumen-style architecture.\nChinese zodiacs will be re-imagined as 12 Disney and Pixar characters at the Garden of the Twelve Friends.\n\"We are building something truly special here in Shanghai that not only showcases the best of Disney's storytelling but also celebrates and incorporates China's incredibly rich heritage to create a one-of-a-kind destination that will delight and entertain the people of China for generations to come,\" said Iger.\nShanghai Disneyland is a joint venture between Disney and China's Shanghai Shendi Group.\n'Grandeur and vast scale'\nLocated in Shanghai's Chuansha town, it will be the company's sixth Disney resort and third in Asia.\nThe last Disneyland opening was almost a decade ago, in Hong Kong.\nStefan Zwanzger, AKA the Theme Park Guy , says the new artwork confirms the grandeur and huge size of Disney's latest project.\n\"What's clear is that Shanghai Disneyland will have much more of a wow factor than the Hong Kong park that opened in 2005,\" he says.\n\"Hong Kong opened with minimal attractions, but Shanghai right from the start has had a bigger budget and will be much more complete.\"\nZwanzger predicts off-the-charts popularity for the park, warning that the two planned hotels are likely to be insufficient to meet massive demand.\n\"I wouldn't want to be the guy in a Mickey Mouse costume in front of the castle in the first week after opening with all those people coming at me,\" he adds. \"I would be scared.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.thethemeparkguy.com/", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150715135932-disneyland-shanghai-designs-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150715135932-disneyland-shanghai-designs-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150715135932-disneyland-shanghai-designs-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150715135932-disneyland-shanghai-designs-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150715135932-disneyland-shanghai-designs-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150715135932-disneyland-shanghai-designs-small-169.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/4dKsvqCEbrI?rel=0", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150715135932-disneyland-shanghai-designs-full-169.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T16:10:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
