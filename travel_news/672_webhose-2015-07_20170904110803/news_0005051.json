Some have dubbed it the world's friendliest volcano, although its primal ferocity and occasionally dangerous eruptions of lava and gas would seem to defy that description. \nThe volcano is particularly accessible, and spectacularly active.

Yasur is on Vanuatu's southern Tanna island, which doesn't have paved roads and where many of its 30,000 people continue to live as the islanders have for centuries in simple thatch huts with pigs and chickens running freely. \nLegend has it that the volcano is a god. Kelson Hosea, who owns the rustic Jungle Oasis bungalows near the base of Yasur, said the story goes that Yasur returned home one day to find his two wives and four sons still at the beach, and in anger turned himself into a pig, before falling asleep. \n\"When the boys came back home with their mother, they saw the pig and they got angry,\" he said. \"They got angry and they didn't realise that it was their father. They thought it was a pig. And they killed the pig with a stick. And the pig exploded.\" \nHe said the four distinct craters in the volcano represent the four sons.

To enter the volcano grounds, there is a 3350 vatu (NZ$45) fee. \nFrom the base, it's about a 90-minute hike to the crater rim. There's also an access road, and, for a fee, local drivers will take tourists up, leaving just a 15-minute walk across a rugged, barren moonscape to the rim. \nThere's a lonely postal box near the top marked the \"Volcano Post\" where tourists can mail postcards. \nAuthorities periodically close Yasur when the eruptions get too violent and it becomes too dangerous to stand near the crater rim. \nYoram Teitler, a geologist who was recently a research fellow at the University of Western Australia, said the volcano has been active for perhaps 2000 years. It is constantly bubbling, with larger eruptions coming once or twice an hour. Observers can stand about 150 metres from the crater floor. \nA man watches the eruption from a safe distance.

You need to have a specific viscosity of the lava, a specific amount of gases within the magma. And as well, a proper plumbing system to trigger such regular explosions.\" \nTeitler said that once people arrive on the rim, it's important to avoid the poisonous sulfurous gases coming from the craters and some side vents by taking a position upwind of them. He said that if the lava does explode beyond the rim, rather than running blindly away it's better to watch where the hunks are falling so you can avoid them. \nVanuatu President Baldwin Lonsdale said the volcano has become a popular tourist attraction and a place where locals are able to make some money. \n\"But people have to be very careful when they walk up the volcano,\" he said. \"Because it's very dangerous there.\" \nFor those willing to brave the volcano at night, they can see a display that is both spectacular and elemental, one that creates new terrain and connects to the very origins of the planet. - AP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T04:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T15:34:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
