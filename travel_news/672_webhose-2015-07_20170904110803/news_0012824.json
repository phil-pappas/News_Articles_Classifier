The public-private sector ministerial meeting is a continued approach by the Seychelles Government to come out with comprehensive strategies designed to solve issues or challenges seen to be affecting the tourism industry. During the last session of the multi-sectoral ministerial meeting, there was a transparent and open debate on the proposed Seychelles air access charters to China as well as the marketing approach to China and India. Discussions also continued on Air Seychelles domestic and International rates; the latter touching on the applicable rates for the Indian market comparing it to the applicable rate to Mauritius which is over two hours longer. \nThe meeting which also saw the presence of Charles Bastienne, Minister of Home Affairs, Christian Lionnet Minister of Land Use and Housing, Didier Dogley Minister of Environment, Energy and Climate Change, Wallace Cosgrow Minister for Fisheries and Agriculture and Micheal Benstrong Minister for Investment , Entrepreneurship Development and Business Innovation touched base on other issues such as Finance, Environment and Land use. \nAlain St.Ange Minister for Tourism and Culture said the public-private sector ministerial meeting has created a new spirit of openness in the country. \n“It’s been a very frank, open and transparent meeting, which created something new for the country: the spirit of openness. We must not forget that since the last couple of years ago this new approach in looking at the tourism industry is bearing fruits for Seychelles. Today this transparency and openness that exist is a big step in working together between the island's government and its private sector’’ Minister St.Ange said. \nThe Minister went on to say that the public and the private sector should continue working together for the country to continue to move forward. \n“ Seychelles has but one tourism industry. We do not have a Government Tourism Industry and a Private Sector Tourism Industry. What we have is a Seychelles Tourism Industry and the whole country needs to work together to make sure we move forward together to consolidate our tourism industry for the long term\" said Minister Alain St.Ange during a press interview after this July multi-sectorial ministerial meeting that was held at National House.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T09:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T14:26:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
