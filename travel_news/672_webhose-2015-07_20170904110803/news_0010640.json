(Courtesy/Aggie Paech) GUNTERSVILLE, Alabama – Keith Miller, the dynamic founding pastor of Life's Journey Church in Huntsville, Ala., and a mission leader and motivator, will speak July12, 2015, at Church on the Lake in Guntersville, as the summer of informal Christian worship services continues.\nChurch on the Lake offers non-denominational worship services Sundays from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend in a fresh-air setting by Guntersville Lake. Services are held Sundays at 10 a.m. at the Marshall Baptist Retreat Center .\nSome of the speakers – including Alabama football chaplain Jeremiah Castille and retired Madison County Circuit Court Judge Billy Bell – are regionally famous. Others are less prominent, but no less inspiring -- like Glenn Wood, the music minister for Falkville's No Fences Cowboy Church.\nIncluded for the first time in the schedule this summer was Anne Kent, a Bible study leader and Christian counselor. Other speakers this summer thus far have included: Randall Stover, the director of missions for the Marshall County Baptist Association ; Madison County Sheriff Blake Dorning; former Auburn defensive tackle Wayne Dickens, now director of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes in eastern Alabama; music evangelist Bob Smith ; Bob Boerner Jr., director of North Alabama Young Business Leaders ; and Tony Reppucci, founder of Joshua Twenty-Four Ministry in Huntsville, Ala., and retired as sales director for Bentley Automotive Group.\nBegun more than 50 years ago, the inter-denominational Christian worship services -- which are held at 10 a.m. every Sunday from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend -- offer old-time worship in a lawn-chair setting. Ever since the crowds gathered by the Sea of Galilee to listen to Jesus, lakeside worship, for Christians, feels a little like coming home.\nThe traditional-style worship services (that means people sing old-time revival hymns and hear great special music and a Bible-based sermon) are held in the open-sided pavilion of the Marshall (County) Baptist Retreat Center, rain or shine. Chairs are provided; experienced Church on the Lake attenders bring an old-fashioned cardboard fan with them. The camp's address is 271 Baptist Camp Road, which turns off of U.S. 431 a few miles north of Guntersville between mile markers 301 and 302.\nSchedule for remaining weeks:\nJuly 12 with Keith Miller, pastor of Life's Journey Church in Huntsville, Ala., and inspiring mission leader. July 19 with Jeremiah Castille , former Alabama All-American player, former pro football player and, for more than 10 years, chaplain for the Alabama Crimson Tide football team. July 26 with Glenn Wood, the music minister for No Fences Cowboy Church in Falkville, Ala. Wood is a songwriter and worship leader with a cowboy's heart. Aug. 2 with the Rev. Dr. Bill Bostick , retired United Methodist minister with wide experience as a pastor and district superintendent. Aug. 9 with Leon Manigan, founding co-pastor of New Life Outreach International , a multi-cultural ministry in Huntsville, Ala., that works in inner-city ministry, helping the homeless, and men and women's drug rehabilitation. Aug. 16 with recently retired Madison County Circuit Court Judge Billy Bell . Aug. 23 with David Berryhill, associate pastor of First Baptist Church of Powder Spring , Ga. Aug. 30 with Charles Gattis, now retired as senior pastor of Trinity United Methodist Church in Huntsville, Ala. Sept. 6 with John Croyle, founder Big Oak Ranch for Boys & Girls , a calling he choose when he could have played professional football after his college career as a stand-out defensive end on the University of Alabama's 1973 National Championship team.", "external_links": ["https://my.fca.org/2349-dickens-wayne.aspx", "http://www.marshallbaptistretreat.com/", "http://www.nofencescc.com/#/welcome", "http://www.joshuatwentyfour.org/home", "http://www.hsvnewlife.org/", "http://www.trinityhsv.org/", "http://www.bobsmithmusic.org/", "http://www.fbcps.org/index.php/church-blog/item/dave-berryhill", "http://ybl.org/about/locations/huntsville/", "http://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?size=200x200&zoom=13&markers=size:mid|color:blue|label:|34.4160896,-86.2622245&maptype=roadmap&sensor=false", "http://www.lifesjourneychurch.com/", "http://castillefoundation.org/", "http://www.bigoak.org/", "http://www.marshallba.com/"], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T21:11:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
