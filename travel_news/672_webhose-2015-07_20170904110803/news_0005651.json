That starts with our contract. It's time we share in the profits we help create.\" \nPicketing times will vary by location. \n\"We're calling Flight Attendants across the industry to join us,\" said Nelson. \"Raising the standards at United will benefit Flight Attendants at American, Delta, and every other airline. Flight Attendants are united and marching together in support of their negotiating committee. It's our turn and it's past time.\" \nUnited has failed to reach a unified labor contract with its 24,000 flight attendants despite a boast by United Chief Executive Jeff Smisek following the airline's October 2010 merger with Continental that he would complete joint contracts with all workers by the end of 2011. Meanwhile, United Airlines is making record profits and its 2015 income will be more than five times higher than in 2013; operating profit in 2015-2017 is expected to be $5 billion or more in each year; United has $7.0 Billion in cash on its balance sheet and its stock price has jumped 162% since negotiations began; Smisek's pay is up 32% and other top executives and shareholders are also cashing in.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T22:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T21:51:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
