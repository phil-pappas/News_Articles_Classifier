By Jay Reeves ASSOCIATED PRESS • Sunday July 19, 2015 5:00 AM \nMONROEVILLE, Ala. — Harper Lee’s novel To Kill a Mockingbird is always nearby in this quiet city in southwestern Alabama. \nMonroeville is not only the birthplace and home of the 89-year-old author but also the inspiration for the fictional town of Maycomb in her Pulitzer Prize-winning book about race and injustice in the Deep South of the 1930s. \nIn the spotlight again after the release last week of the Mockingbird sequel, Go Set a Watchman , Monroeville offers sites aplenty that draw fans searching for remnants of that “tired old town” where attorney Atticus Finch defended a wrongly accused Tom Robinson while Finch’s children, Jem and Scout, watched from the courtroom balcony. \nThe town offers a Mockingbird Inn and a restaurant named for Boo Radley, the recluse turned hero in the book. Both fill with visitors each spring when the community puts on a stage adaption of Mockingbird that draws visitors worldwide. \nAlso, a bronze statue on the courthouse square and a wall-size Mockingbird mural on the side of a building are constant reminders of the town’s claim to fame. \nBut all those things are based on the book, not part of it. Other spots around town actually helped make Mockingbird , released 55 years ago. \nStart at Mel’s Dairy Dream on S. Alabama Avenue, a busy main road in the city of 6,300, and walk north toward the square. \nThe small block restaurant, ringed by service windows and a counter where customers plop down money for ice-cream cones, stands on the site of Lee’s childhood home, which was torn down decades ago. Mel’s is just a short walk from the school where Lee attended classes and, by extension, where her alter ego, Scout, and Jem began their “longest journey together” at the book’s climax. \nLee shared the old house with her siblings, mother and father, A.C. Lee, a lawyer and Alabama legislator who was the basis for Atticus Finch. Finch returns in Watchman as his daughter goes home to Maycomb 20 years later as an adult. \nNext door to Mel’s and across a weathered stone fence is a grassy lot with the remains of a house foundation and a historical marker that recalls the site as the one-time home of author Truman Capote, Lee’s childhood friend and the inspiration for the character Dill in Mockingbird . As adults, the two collaborated on Capote’s classic crime story In Cold Blood , published in 1966. \nThe homes of Lee’s — and Finch’s — neighbors are long gone, replaced by parking lots and stores. The paved street is no longer shaded by big trees or transformed by rain into “red slop,” as the author described in Mockingbird . \nBut the courthouse and jail that recall pivotal moments in the book are still less than a half-mile away on the courthouse square. \nNow a museum, the old Monroe County Courthouse was completed in 1903 and is home to the balconied courtroom that served as the model for the crucial legal scene in the film version of Mockingbird . A tall white dome tops the building; magnolia trees shade the lawn. \nInside, visitors can walk across the shiny wooden floor and sit in the old witness chair where Robinson, who was black, would have defended himself against false charges of raping a white woman before an all-white jury. A potbellied stove is beside the jury box. \nThe jail where Atticus would have protected Robinson from a lynch mob is now an office across the street. \nIn the atrium outside the courtroom, part of a gnarly old tree trunk taken from near the original Lee home site is encased in plastic. With a notch in the side, the log evokes the knotty hardwood where Boo Radley emerged from his spooky, run-down home to leave gifts for Scout and her brother in Mockingbird . \nRadley was thought to be based on a seldom-seen neighbor of the Lees, Alfred Boulware, who died in 1952 and is buried in the same cemetery as Lee’s father, who died in 1962. The graveyard is beside the town’s United Methodist Church a few blocks from the courthouse. \nAnd Lee is in town, too, “although very quiet,” as she wrote in 1993. Mostly deaf and blind, the author spends her days in an assisted-living home in Monroeville. \nRecently, Lee attended a luncheon at the downtown restaurant Prop and Gavel, which is owned by her lawyer and the lawyer’s husband. Lee received the first copies of her new book from the publisher and chatted with well-wishers. \nBut mostly, like Boo, she is seldom seen around town.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T13:13:31.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
