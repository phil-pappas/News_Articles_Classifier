This includes the wider impacts from the supply chain as well as customer and employee spend, which when combined almost always exceed the direct impact of the hotels themselves. \n\nKey findings: · The positive economic and tax benefits are by far the greatest impact – amounting to €84 per guest per night – far exceeding the negative environmental (-€4) and social (-€0.2) costs. However, this is a one-year (2013) snapshot and does not take account of the construction of the hotels. In addition, many environmental and social impacts will accumulate over a longer timeframe. · Greenhouse gases (GHG) are the most significant environmental cost – although this represents less than 0.01% of total GHG emissions in Cyprus. GHG impact more than doubles if flights to/from Cyprus are included. · The most significant social benefit identified across all of the social impact areas is that associated with ‘on the job’ experience, with an upper estimate of €6.2 per guest night. This highlights the tourism sector’s significant role in developing skills in the Cypriot workforce, which is important in the context of the Cypriot economy where unemployment has increased in recent years, particularly among young people. · Work placements, where a placement is a condition of an individual’s degree, yielded the highest social impact per person (€8,800 per work placement student). However, its relatively small overall impact is primarily driven by the small number of Cypriot work placement students currently benefiting at each hotel. \nSalli Felton, Chief Executive of the Travel Foundation, said: \n“This pilot represents a major advance in understanding how tourism impacts on destinations and confirms that visitor numbers on their own can only tell half the story. A ‘big picture’ approach can best inform those who develop and manage tourism so that local communities, the environment and businesses thrive. It’s clear from our research that broad public and private sector collaboration is essential, and every tourism organisation with a stake in a destination or a particular sustainability challenge will have something to contribute.” \n\nMalcolm Preston, Global Sustainability Leader at PwC, said: \n“We are delighted to have been able to support the Travel Foundation and the TUI Group in applying our Open Sourced TIMM framework to this project. Whilst we have applied the framework to many different industry sectors, this is the first time we have applied it to the Travel and Tourism sector. The pilot study has proved two key things: Firstly, what we all intuitively thought – that tourism can be a force for good in a destination; and secondly, and perhaps more importantly, an in-depth analytical tool like TIMM can help companies develop strategies to continually improve that impact year on year.” Related Posts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T13:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T14:30:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
