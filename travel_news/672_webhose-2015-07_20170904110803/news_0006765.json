The Asotin native was primarily a defensive tackle in college before switching to offense midway through his junior season and was consistently cited by Seahawks OL coach Tom Cable as a standout during OTAs and minicamp.\nRB Thomas Rawls: The 5-9, 215-pound Rawls was another who impressed the Seahawks with his play during OTAs and minicamp. Rawls began his career at Michigan before ending it at Central Michigan, and could prove an intriguing option depending on how things shake out at the backup tailback spot. As his size suggests, he is considered a power runner and also has shown decent hands.\nSS Keenan Lambert: Lambert has an intriguing background — he is the half-brother of Kam Chancellor. The Seahawks also have a need for some younger players to emerge at safety, particularly strong safety with Johnson having departed via free agency. Like Chancellor, he comes with a reputation for aggressive play.\nS Triston Wade: Listed as a safety, the 5-11, 170-pounder from Texas-San Antonio also played some cornerback during OTAs and minicamp and in particular might have a chance as a slot cornerback.\nDT T.Y. McGill: The Seahawks are always on the lookout for interior defensive line help and saw something they liked in the 6-foot, 299-pounder when he was a tryout player in the team’s rookie minicamp, signing him to the 90-man roster soon after. Another defensive lineman, end Benson Mayowa, made the roster in 2013 after initially signing after having tried out in rookie minicamp.\nTwo other undrafted free agents come with particularly intriguing backgrounds — long snapper Nate Boyer, a 34-year-old former Green Beret who revived his football career as a walk-on at Texas ; and receiver Kasen Williams, a former star at Skyline High School and the University of Washington whose college career was derailed by a significant foot injury as a junior .\nBut if Williams is healthy and back to pre-injury form, he could make some noise.\nUp next: Could there really be a battle at backup quarterback?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T21:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T08:36:34.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
