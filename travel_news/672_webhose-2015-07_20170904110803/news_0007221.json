When that fails is when it pays to have insurance. \n\"These are only a handful of the pitfalls shady scammers try on with tourists,\" Morrison says. \n\"A good thing to remember is to keep the common sense you'd use at home with you on holiday. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\" \nTourists must also remember that travel insurance is there to pay for losses resulting from \"unexpected\" events. \nFalling victim to a scam is often unexpected, but if travellers do things that are extremely foolish, their travel insurer may end up declining a claim. \nIt also pays to research the country you're going to and any problems other tourists have faced there recently. \nPickpockets \nVisitors to the Louvre are a target for light-fingered thieves.

They even help clean off the mess - while helping themselves to your wallet. \nThe back pocket is not place for a wallet. Zip-up pockets, slash-proof backpacks, and hidden pouches are all precautions that can make you a tough target for pickpockets. \nAn expensive dinner \nDining out is safer than ordering in. Photo: 123rf.com \nMorrison warns that no matter how hungry, tired or jet-lagged you are, never order food from a takeaway menu slipped under your door. You'll probably never see any food, worse still the person on the other line now has your credit card details and can remove a large amount of money from your account. A better idea is to dine in at local restaurants or order room service. \nOpen wi-fi \nHandy service, but is someone harvesting your passwords while you use that free wi-fi? Photo: 123rf.com \nIt doesn't take a genius to set up a wi-fi hub. While you're browsing the net, someone can access your personal information and passwords. Be careful about connecting to generic networks with names like \"free wi-fi\", or \"free coffee shop wi-fi\". It you're wanting secure wi-fi find a server that requires a password. \nFake friends \nFriendly locals are a joy to travellers, but telling the goodies from the baddies isn't always easy. Photo: 123rf.com \nBeware of lovely locals outside attractions offering rosary beads, sticks of rosemary, friendship bracelets and rings. They're not complimentary, and these friendly locals will soon be demanding money and making a scene so you'll pay them to go away. \nFront desk diligence \nIs that really reception calling? Photo: 123rf.com \nPreying on the tired is particularly immoral, says Morrison. This scam happens late at night, or early in the morning, with \"reception\" apologising for the late call and asking you to verify your credit card details. Unwittingly you read them out and go back to sleep. \nImposter police \nThese are real Vietnamese police. Beware demands for \"instant\" fines. Photo: 123rf.com \nNot all policemen around the world are what they seem, says Morrison. \n\"If you're ever stopped by someone in an official looking uniform who tells you you've broken the law and must pay an instant fine, see this for what it is â€“ a bribe. Keep your temper, try to walk away or insist on settling things at the station.\" \nThe waiting game \nVibrant markets are interesting places, but keep your wits about you. Photo: 123rf.com \nThis is common in countries with strong cash economies, Morrison says. \n\"You'll buy something in cash and the cashier slowly, often painfully, counts your change. Impatiently you grab your change and walk off only to find the cashier has pocketed some.\" \nCorrupt cabbies \nNew Zealand cabbies are generally trustworthy. Those high standards aren't always matched overseas. 13rf.com \n\"This scam is not new and is ever-evolving with many travellers having lost their luggage to shady taxi drivers the minute they start their holiday\", says Morrison. \nA few tips include keeping your baggage in sight at all times or watching it being loaded into the car, negotiating a fare before you get going and knowing where your end destination is. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T09:41:26.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
