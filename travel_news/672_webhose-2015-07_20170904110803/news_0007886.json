It’s been home, too, to some of the game’s most outstanding and sometimes controversial players. Sir Garfield Sobers, the Bajan who captained Nottinghamshire in the late Sixties, was arguably the greatest all-rounder ever to play the game, and was famously the first player to hit six sixes in one over, which he did at Swansea in 1968. Even more remarkable was bowler Harold Larwood, a gentle, stocky Nottinghamshire miner, who combined astonishing accuracy with fearsome pace. He was playing for England in the 1932-33 tour of Australia, when the visiting team had to cope with the masterful batting of Donald Bradman. “The Don” had done much to beat England in 1930 and was so indomitable that neutralising him became the overriding goal, if England were to escape without humiliation. Larwood was under instruction from the England captain, the public school-educated Douglas Jardine, to bowl aggressively: short and fast, aiming for the batsman’s body and head and not the wicket. This forced the Australians to fend off the ball by lifting the bat high, lobbing the ball into the hands of the leg-side fielders circled around. The goal was to intimidate the batsmen, specifically Bradman, and catch them out without scoring runs. The name of the technique became known as \"bodyline\" bowling. A traditional cake of the Nottinghamshire working class, Cattern cakes were made by lacemakers on November 25, St Catherine’s Day Was it “cricket”? No, probably not, and bodyline bowling was outlawed later, in 1935. The MCC required that Larwood, not Jardine, apologise for the bowling method. Larwood refused, on the basis that he had simply been following orders. He never played Test cricket again, but he did emigrate to Australia in 1950, and was welcomed warmly. In honour of one of the great cricketers, here is a recipe for Cattern cakes, a traditional cake of the Nottinghamshire working class. They were made by the lacemakers of Nottinghamshire on November 25, St Catherine’s Day. The shape is a Catherine wheel but the name honours both St Catherine, the patron saint of unmarried women who was sentenced to death on a wheel (she shattered it with a single touch – go girl! – but was later beheaded) and Catherine of Aragon, who was (wrongly) attributed with introducing lace making into the area. Before the Victorian era they would have been made with a yeasted dough, but with the invention of baking powder in the mid-19th century, a richer biscuit-like version became popular. I’m bringing back the bun, but still with the Catherine wheel shape. They use caraway seeds, which are not to everyone’s taste but think of them as a British take on the cinnamon bun. Not posh, but proper. Nottinghamshire Cattern cakes recipe Makes 12 generously sized buns. For the cakes 1lb/450g strong flour 1 sachet (14g) easy blend yeast 4oz/110g caster sugar 2tsp caraway seeds 8fl oz/225ml warm milk grated zest of one lemon 2 eggs 3oz/85g butter at room temperature 2oz/60g currants For the filling 7oz/ 200g brown sugar 3tsp ground cinnamon 3oz/85g butter at room temperature Mix the flour, yeast, sugar and caraway seeds. Beat the milk, lemon zest and eggs together lightly and add them to the mix along with the butter and currants. Mix to a soft dough, ideally in a tabletop mixer, then knead for five minutes until smooth. Cover and leave to rise for an hour or so. Divide the dough in two and roll out half into a big oblong, about 16x10in/40x25cm. Mix the filling ingredients and spread over the dough. Roll it up, starting at the short edge. Repeat with the rest of the dough and filling. If you have time, wrap the rolls in clingfilm and chill for an hour or so – this will make it easier to slice. Slice the roll into 1¾in/4cm slices. Arrange on a parchment-lined baking sheet, tucking the loose ends underneath each roll if necessary. If the dough is chilled, cover and give an hour to come up to room temperature, otherwise five minutes will be enough. Meanwhile, heat the oven to Gas 6/200C. Bake for 10-15 minutes until risen and golden. Cool on the tray.Brush with a little water mixed with icing sugar to make a glaze if you like.
