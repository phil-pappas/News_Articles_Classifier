The original bungalows opened in 1938 and proved a hit with celebrities like Marilyn Monroe and Jean Harlow. The freestanding hideaways each have a private patio, sitting area and wet bar and were built to look like a Southern California beach house. Michael Berman, a Los Angeles-based interior designer, was responsible for the renovation, the gray-blue color tones, vintage-inspired art from local artists and 1950s-style furnishings. Bungalow guests have a dedicated concierge staff and also get a fully stocked minibar as well as breakfast. Nightly rates from $900.\nMORE LEISURE STOPS FOR FRONTIER\nIn Transit Travel news, deals and tips, written by the editors and reporters of the Travel section.
