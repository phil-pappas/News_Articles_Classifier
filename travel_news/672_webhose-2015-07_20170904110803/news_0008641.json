He is remembered in several plants familiar to gardeners, especially Thunbergia alata (black-eyed Susan) and Berberis thunbergii. In 1773, collecting plants in South Africa, he found and pressed a new plant that he named Citrullus lanatus or, to you and me, watermelon . The pressed specimen is still in the herbarium in Uppsala in Sweden. Pressing specimens of plants in the family Cucurbitaceae (gourds) isn’t easy. The flowers and fruits are often large, fleshy and difficult to preserve, and the leaves are often large and extremely variable. And Thunberg’s specimen is a mess: just a few crumbly leaves that could be almost anything. Fortunately, modern taxonomists can look directly at DNA, which tells them exactly what a plant is, and what its closest relatives are. Two German botanists, in research reported in the journal New Phytologist, have done exactly that with Thunberg’s plant. So, is it a watermelon? No, it isn’t. That is, it’s not the same large, red-fleshed fruit that you or I can buy at any supermarket. Nor is it particularly closely related to that plant. Which is kind of a relief, because thinking that watermelons came from South Africa was starting to cause all kinds of problems. For a start, there are no wild watermelons in South Africa; as a wild plant, watermelons are endemic to west Africa. Furthermore, there’s archaeological evidence of watermelons in south-west Libya about 5,000 years ago and illustrations of watermelons in Egyptian tombs. None of this is consistent with watermelon, or its wild ancestor, being a South African plant. Citron melon in the Kalahari region of South Africa, Copyright: ALAMY So that leaves two questions. First, what is Thunberg’s plant? It’s actually Citrullus amarus, the citron melon. Its alternative names, preserving melon or jam melon, reflect the fact that it’s rarely eaten raw, but has (apparently) been used for making jam for centuries. And if you’ve never heard of citron melon, you’re not alone, I hadn’t either… nor has anyone else as far as I can tell. My New Oxford Book of Food Plants mentions it not, there’s no supplier in the RHS Plant Finder, and it may not even be in cultivation in the UK, so news of anyone who has tried growing it, or eaten the jam, would be welcome. Second, how did Thunberg come to think his plant was a watermelon? The answer is that he didn’t. Linnaeus had described and named the true watermelon, which he called Cucurbita citrullus, 20 years earlier, and Thunberg knew his plant was a different species, which is why he gave it a different name. Thunberg’s name only got mixed up with the watermelon in the Thirties, and the error spread until everyone believed the watermelon was C. lanatus. Today, C. lanatus is so entrenched that the only realistic option is to consign the mix-up to the historical dustbin and accept that as the legitimate name for the watermelon. •Melons that grow well in the UK That watermelons come from the wet tropics at least explains why most British gardeners find them difficult to grow, even in a greenhouse . If they really did originate from South Africa, they would probably need a bit less heat, and maybe a bit less water, too. Musk or cantaloupe melons (Cucumis melo), which British gardeners find more accommodating, come from Iran and neighbouring countries. In fact, the entire gourd family are plants of warm climates, barely making it into Britain; our one native species, white bryony (Bryonia dioica), is common only in the warmer and drier parts of England, and is more or less absent from Wales or Scotland. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T12:49:36.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
