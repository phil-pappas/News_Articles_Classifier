We know that events play a vital role in promoting a destination, driving tourism and fostering community pride.”\nChief Commercial Officer Liverpool FC, Billy Hogan, said: “We are delighted with the support for LFC from the city of Brisbane. We first visited Australia two years ago and received a great reception from the Australian fans and we hope this tour visit will be no exception.\n“LFC strives to give supporters the chance to see the team up close, no matter how far away from Anfield they live and we are delighted to be able to make this a reality for more of our Australian fans.”\nDeputy Mayor of Brisbane, Cr Adrian Schrinner, said this was an opportunity for Brisbane residents to show their colours for their heroes in what would be a blockbuster weekend of football for the city.\n“We look forward to welcoming thousands of Liverpool FC supporters from across Australia and around the world, as they take on our local heroes Brisbane Roar at Suncorp Stadium, and we’ll be lighting the Story Bridge red on Friday night to mark the occasion,” Cr Schrinner said.\n“Hot on the heels of Liverpool FC’s clash with Brisbane Roar we have Australia taking on the South Africans in the rugby and the Brisbane Broncos clashing with Wests Tigers in rugby league, further reinforcing Brisbane’s reputation for staging world-class sporting events.”\nSuncorp Stadium General Manager, Alan Graham, said securing the world famous Liverpool FC had been two years in the making.\n“The game against Brisbane Roar will be part of a massive weekend for the Stadium. It will be the first time we’ve hosted a quadruple-header which will see up to 140,000 fans across three football codes through the gates over the four day period,” Mr Graham said.\n“We will ‘Liverfy’ the Stadium including the re-creation of the famous Kop zone and renaming of stands and bars at the venue in honour of Liverpool legends.
