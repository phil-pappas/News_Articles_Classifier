The trail itself features wetlands and old growth forests, including a beautiful stand of old growth hemlocks. The Damascus Trail is one of the six trails featured in the “Take a Hike!” program. The six trails in the Delaware River Valley are rated by difficulty and length, and are a perfect way to get out and experience a National Park nearby.
