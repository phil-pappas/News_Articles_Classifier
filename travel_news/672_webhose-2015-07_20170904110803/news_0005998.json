Similarly, input costs are expected to decline during the year ahead but not by as much as was anticipated earlier this year; Both passenger and cargo volumes were reported to have expanded during Q2, but at a weaker rate than in Q1, suggesting that growth transport volumes may have peaked in previous months; There is also a view that volume growth will continue in the year ahead, but not at the strong pace than was expected earlier in the year, likely reflecting concerns over weakness in the global business environment and emerging market economies; Respondents continue to report declines in yields in both businesses, for the recent past and the coming year, reflecting downward pressure from falling fuel prices. But the survey suggests those declines may have bottomed out as they are stable compared to the Q1 survey; Airline employment activity is reported to have increased slightly in Q2, reflecting the continuation of positive financial performance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T14:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T22:02:01.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
