Due to give a speech in the City of London, I was up early, but the radio had reports of a suspected power surge on the Underground so I emailed to the organiser saying I was worried I might run into travel problems. We agreed to keep an eye on the TV news. As I watched the police cars and fire engines outside Aldgate Tube station, I had no idea that one of the people dearest to our family, our children’s beloved babysitter and spit-spot Mary Poppins, was in the Underground tunnel below, terrified and waiting in the choking dark for help. The scene in Tavistock Square following the 7/7 attack (Photo: PA) I had no idea that Shehzad Tanweer, a young Muslim almost the same age as Emma was then, had detonated a bomb that had blown apart the carriage directly in front of the one in which Emma was travelling, to start work experience that day with her mother. I had no idea that members of the emergency services stood at the top of the escalator and were not allowed to go down and rescue stricken passengers in case there was a second bomb. (The Blitz Spirit had been cancelled in some quarters on 7/7 due to Health and Safety legislation. That dreadful day, it was often civilians and off-duty emergency personnel who did what came naturally, binding the wounds and comforting the dying.) I could not have known that, along with other passengers, ever-resourceful Emma had broken open the First Aid box, only to find a single, small ice-scraper. No idea that her mother had stopped her St John’s Ambulance-trained daughter from going into the bomb carriage and seeing what could never be unseen. Thank God, at least, for that small mercy. It was mid-afternoon when I heard a message on the house answerphone: Emma reassuring us that she was OK. Well, about as OK as you can be when you’ve made your way along a Tube track, stepping on and over bits of your fellow human beings. (The image of one charred body with its clothes blown off stayed with Emma for a long time.) She was about as OK as you can be when you finally get to the office, look into the mirror in the lift and see that you and your mum are both totally black, save for the whites of your astounded eyes. But on July 7, 2005, OK was the best you could hope for. OK was wonderful. There were 52 families who would have given everything they had for OK. People like Julie Nicholson, the Anglican priest whose daughter Jenny was murdered at Edgware Road . Emily Watson played the shell-shocked mother in A Song For Jenny on BBC One . It was devastating to watch, howlingly upsetting, as it should be. To hold for the last time the hand that first held yours. To need to know, as Julie Nicholson did, every last crucifying detail so, even in death, she might somehow share her child’s burden. An amputation without anaesthetic, a grief without end. •A Song for Jenny, BBC One, review: 'deeply moving' Emily Watson as Julie Nicholson in A Song for Jenny (Photo: BBC) Hazel Webb, whose 29-year-old daughter Laura also died that morning, says she thinks of her child “not quite every minute, but every hour, she’s there”. Four Muslim men who had all the advantages of growing up in our country hated our way of life so much that they murdered Jenny, Laura and all the other daughters and sons, mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters. It was, it still is, intolerable. Equally dismaying is the fact that, ten years on, the threat, as the Prime Minister admitted yesterday, continues to be real and deadly. Scotland Yard’s anti-terrorism squad says it has foiled up to 50 plots since 7/7 . In the intervening decade, there have been more than 2,000 terrorism-related arrests . As we observed the silence for the dead of 7/7, arrests were at a record high, with almost one detention every single day. A mourner leaves a rose on a 7/7 memorial on the tenth anniversary of the attack (Photo: STEPHEN HIRD/AFP/Getty Images) Against that horrifying background, consider the complaint this week in the Guardian by the writer and editor, Mehdi Hasan . He says that since 7/7, British Muslims have met with discrimination – “subject to unprecedented scrutiny; tagged as a suspect community, the enemy within, a 'fifth column’ (to Quote: Nigel Farage)”. Well, yes. If substantial numbers of men from a certain group in society are presenting an unprecedented threat to a country, then scrutiny and suspicion do tend to be the result. As for discrimination, try lying on a beach in Tunisia and being shot dead for no reason other than not being Muslim . I’m not sure that Hasan and commentators like him fully grasp the widespread dismay at the failure of many Muslims to accept the values of our society, equality for women being foremost among them. Only last week, Manchester Crown Court heard how a schoolgirl was woken in her bed on her 14th birthday by her father and forced to marry a man in his thirties in the lounge of her family home. The child had no idea what was going on during the ceremony, which was performed by an imam in Bengali, but she was “pinched” by an aunt at certain points to indicate that she should speak. This great, diverse, ingenious, tolerant and respectful city. This London. #WeStandTogether #SevenSeven pic.twitter.com/BU21yvA0Yy — St Paul's Cathedral (@StPaulsLondon) July 7, 2015 The father was jailed, after admitting child cruelty, for just 14 weeks. His barrister claimed he had new “insight” after being placed on a series of “forced marriage” courses. No other family members or the imam were prosecuted. And they keep on coming, these awful stories. A huge rise in sharia marriages is reported , many of them polygamous, all taking place in a parallel world within our liberal western one. What hope is there of Muslim children integrating into the wider culture, and coming to regard it proudly as their own? You know, I really don’t want to live in a country which needs something called a “forced marriage” course. Neither did Emma. She’s in Australia now. On the tenth anniversary of the day Tanweer nearly killed her, she went to a liberal mosque to talk about her experiences of 7/7. The imam told Emma what an important symbol her visit was. One Muslim friend who was present said: “Muslims’ lack of understanding of other religions is quite scary.” Education, he said, was key. “Only education can stop the cancer spreading.” • 7/7 bombings: Prince William joins survivors and bereaved families at memorial service • Allison Pearson: We must get rid of the dreadful Human Rights Act Emma texted me later: “I had to spend the day remembering that not all Muslims are out to kill us.” A sad, sorrowful sentiment Muslims might like to reflect on. I know how Emma hates to be reminded of 7/7, but anyway I texted back: “Just to say how glad we are that you’re still here and how much we love you.” Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T02:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T20:28:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
