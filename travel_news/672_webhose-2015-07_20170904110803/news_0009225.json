Fear not – we’ve done the job for you, working our way through jar upon jar of marmalade in the process and testing functionality, durability, value for money and aesthetics.\n1. Graef TO62: £60.06, amazon.co.uk\nNot only does this look sophisticated, but it comes with handy extras like an integrated bun-warming rack, which is great if you love croissants. Most importantly it makes great toast in a hurry at under two-and-a-half minutes.\nBuy now\n2. Smeg TSF01: £99.99, johnlewis.com\nSmeg has managed to transfer the iconic looks of its fridges into this top-notch toaster. Making fantastically evenly done toast, with no less than six browning levels, it also has extra-wide slots that easily fit crumpets and bagels. There are seven great colours.\nBuy now\n3. Hotpoint Digital: £59.99, hotpoint.co.uk\nHere’s another brand that’s better known for large appliances, but its entry into the toaster market is well-built and exceptional at cooking everything from crumpets to teacakes, thanks to a removable warming rack. We’d recommend turning the browning setting up to six (out of eight).\nBuy now\n4. Kenwood Persona: £99.99, argos.co.uk\nThe adjustable width slots, sandwich cage and dedicated croissant, bagel, bread and panini settings mean that toasted bread is just the start of what this machine can provide. We also like the peek-and-view function, which means you can check progress without having to cancel the toasting.\nBuy now\n5. Dualit Architect: £74.99, lakeland.co.uk\nWhile most of Dualit’s toasters are 1950s-style, this one is far more contemporary and has interchangeable side panels available in a range of colours, so there’s no need to change your toaster when you change your décor. It is sturdy, toasts quickly and evenly and is simple to use.\nBuy now\n6. Delonghi Distinta: £69.95, johnlewis.com\nKeeping up with the copper interiors trend, this good-looking number is reasonably quick at toasting, taking just three minutes for the first round and less for the next ones. It’s a doddle to use, though crumbs can get stuck in the vents making it a bit of a pain to clean.\nBuy now\n7. KitchenAid Artisan: £152, lakeland.co.uk\nThis is expensive, but it has the classic Artisan looks and makes good toast quickly. We particularly like the progress bar, so that you can see how long you’ve got to go,and the keep warm function, which stops your toast popping up until you’re ready. It even dings at the end like a kettle.#\nBuy now\n8. Morphy Richards Chroma: £29.99, morphyrichards.co.uk\nA well-priced toaster that couldn’t be simpler to use, this makes slice after slice of well-browned toast in just two-and-a-half minutes, making it a great option if the whole family sits down to breakfast together. It also comes in black, cream, red, white if plum isn’t your thing.\nBuy now\n9. Tefal Toast n Egg: £36.88, amazon.co.uk\nIf eggs on toast is your breakfast of choice, this machine has a handy attachment that can poach or boil (up to four at once) eggs while your toast is browning – although it does take longer than most at just under four minutes. It’s straightforward to use and the slots are wide enough for muffins, too.\nBuy now\n10. Tesco 2-Slice: £19.50, tesco.com\nThis cheery toaster is a great option for those who don’t want to splash out. It has nice wide slots, which mean you don’t have to miss out on the likes of bagels or crumpets, and all the usual functions. So get the kettle on (matching one available).\nBuy now\nVerdict:\nThe KitchenAid Artisan is a fantastic buy if you can afford it. For something cheaper, it’s hard to fault the Morphy Richards Chroma and the Graef TO62 .\nRead more:\n11 best food processors\n10 best kettles", "external_links": ["http://www.johnlewis.com/smeg-tsf01-2-slice-toaster/p1709127?sku=234036674&kpid=234036674&s_kenid=71e4be6a-c74f-34a8-ebec-00000cfd2739&s_kwcid=402x173294&tmad=c&tmcampid=73&kpid=234036674", "http://www.morphyrichards.co.uk/products/toasters/2-slice-toasters/221108-Chroma-Plum-2-Slice-Toaster.html", "http://shop.hotpoint.co.uk/sda/hotpoint-tt22eax0-digital-toaster/p/F082320", "http://www.johnlewis.com/de-longhi-distinta-2-slice-toaster/p1739226?sku=233956319&kpid=233956319&s_kenid=71e4be6a-c74f-34a8-ebec-00000cfd2739&s_kwcid=402x34773&tmad=c&tmcampid=73&kpid=233956319", "http://www.lakeland.co.uk/17164/Dualit-2-Slot-Architect-Toaster?gclid=CLaahru__sUCFezMtAodsjsAZA&src=gfeed&s_kwcid=AL!49!3!66287547869!!!g!54997100265!&ef_id=VE7WxwAAACl7is-x:20150607211118:s", "http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tefal-Toast-Egg-TT550015-Toaster/dp/B0013KEDKY", "http://www.lakeland.co.uk/19530/Kitchenaid%C2%AE-Artisan%C2%AE-Toaster", "http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Product/partNumber/2265764.htm", "http://www.amazon.co.uk/Graef-Slice-Toaster-Black-TO62/dp/B0094XX7EK", "http://www.tesco.com/direct/tesco-2-slice-ss-toaster-red/141-8444.prd"], "published": "2015-07-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T21:40:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
