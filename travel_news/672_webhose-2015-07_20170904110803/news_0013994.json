Health care - based on 8 travel reports - by Mike   \nAll over the world there has been a movement towards trying to live a greener existence, and this environmentally friendly lifestyle has been adopted better in some places than others. The Maldives is one of the few places that has taken the risks of climate change extremely seriously, and this is because the country is the lowest in the world. The highest point in the whole island-republic is less than 8 feet high, and this means that if sea levels continue to rise at their current rate- the Maldives could no longer exist by 2100. \n\nWhile most of the Maldivian resorts are partially eco-friendly and a huge leap ahead of resorts in other areas of the world- there are still some resorts that are head and neck above the others. \n\nThe list below demonstrates what you should look for in an environmentally friendly resort in the Maldives: \n\n1. Renewable Energy Systems \n\nMost resorts in the Maldives rely on diesel run generators for their electricity, but the most eco-friendly resorts are making a move towards more renewable resources in order to lessen their carbon footprints. Many of the best eco-resorts should have solar panels installed to generate solar power, and some have taken it even further by creating rainfall catchment systems that allows them to stop importing water from Malé. \n\n2. EarthCheck Certification \n\nEarthCheck certification is given to businesses in the travel and tourism industry, which are making significants efforts and improvements to make their businesses eco-friendly and environmentally viable. \n\n3. Marine Preservation Initiatives \n\nThe marine life that surrounds the islands of the Maldives is the main reason that people visit the archipelagos and the Maldivians have recognised that they need to preserve this natural heritage. \n\nMost of the best eco-resorts will have some sort of marine preservation initiatives that could include educational programs, donations, coral reef adoption and conservation programs. Some of the resorts have gone so far as to have hired their own in-house marine biologists. \n\n4. Eco-Friendly Design and Materials \n\nThe best green resorts utilize materials and designs that are environmentally friendly. Resort and room designs that require little heating and cooling are the best as they can rely on the natural elements to control their temperature fluctuations. Some resorts have started planting exogenous succulent plants, as they don’t need to be watered as often as other plants in the garden and will take down the resorts’ overall water usage. \n\n5. Clear Rules and Regulations \nEnvironmentally friendly resorts should make it clear to all tourists that they are not allowed to touch or collect living things from the protected marine reserves, commercial fishing is also banned and that they should not dispose of any waste or litter in the areas. \n\nThe Maldives is one of the most eco-conscious countries in the world, and the majority of the resorts are stepping up to join in the green revolution in an attempt to save their republic from the consequences of climate change. \n\nSource: Eco-Friendly Designs at Finolhu Villas, Maldives ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T15:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T16:20:32.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
