I try to plan ahead so I know when I’m modelling and when I can work on House of Riot. If I’m modelling, I usually have to be at the job by 8am, but if I’m working in the office, I’ll try to get up at 7.30am, grab an iced latte from the café on the corner and be in the office by 8.30am. I usually schedule meetings for the afternoon and evening so I can spend time making clothes. We’re working on a new collection of one-off customised pieces, including studded jackets. As a model, the expectation is your body is a tool you maintain. I’m lucky in that mine is low maintenance. I go through periods of exercise – I’ve just started classical ballet classes — and I’m conscious of what I eat, but I get really grumpy if I don’t eat regularly. Breakfast is avocado on toast, lunch is a Japanese hand roll, and I’m trying to get back into the habit of cooking in the evenings. My ex-girlfriend was vegan so I’m a vegetarian pro, but I also do a great fish pie with lots of mashed potato. In the evenings, I DJ, work or see friends but try to be in bed by midnight on a school night. Burning the candle at both ends doesn’t work.
