He stares out of the window of his car as HF approaches, clutching a bottle of wine . “Hi,” he says, smiling away. “How are you?” “Fine,” I say, looking nervously towards The Builder’s stationary car. “What’s the matter?” asks HF. “Nothing,” I say. But, in fact, I can barely breathe. I have no idea what to do. Just then, Raymond appears. “Mum,” he says, “is there any dinner on for me?” “Raymond!” I say delightedly – two grown men would surely not size each other up with my teenage son in situ. “Hello Raymond,” says a very friendly HF. “Hi,” says Raymond. “I see you have wine.” “Oh yes,” laughs HF. “I have something to ask your mother.” “So do I,” says Raymond, “along the lines of where is my dinner?” I laugh rather nervously. “On its way,” I say. Raymond raises an eyebrow. Then he looks over the road. “I don’t believe it,” he says. “Is that who I think it is?” ”Who?” I say, pretending to look the other way. I hear The Builder start his car and move off. “Is it… is it?” asks Raymond, almost incapable of speech. I take his hand and dig my nails into it. “Ow!” he says. “I have something to ask your mother.”“Fish and chips?” I say, going back to the house. HF follows Raymond, a quizzical look on his face. “Have I just missed something?” he says. “No,” I say breezily. “Nothing at all.” I hear my mobile bleeping. Somehow I just know The Builder has texted me. “Shall I get your phone?” asks Raymond, now raising both eyebrows. “No,” I say firmly. “Enough of all this. Raymond, I need to talk to your mother about something important,” says HF, opening the wine. What on earth can he mean by this? Raymond looks at him, then he looks at me. My phone bleeps again. “No good will come of this, Mother,” he says, then he stalks off out of the kitchen.
