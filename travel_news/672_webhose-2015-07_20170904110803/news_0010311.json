Photographer Thomas Dekeyser contributed to the Last Breath project, a series of unofficial pre-demolition exhibitions celebrating the final moments of everyday structures around the world\nGuardian Cities is supported by: Rockefeller Foundation\nTuesday 28 July 2015 11.48 BST\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Bethnal Green, London Suitable buildings were opened up to artists to contribute a piece of work. This was done on the understanding that their art would disappear together with the structure it was housed in. In highlighting the smaller cases of destruction, Last Breath tries to reveal the speed of regeneration. London’s Blithehale Medical Centre closed its doors a few years ago. Visitors jumped the fence to the site during the exhibition, and were guided through rooms already chewed apart by demolition\nPhotograph: Bradley Garrett\n Share Share this post close Over the following weeks, excavators continued to fully reduce the hospital to rubble. Just as visitors to the exhibition hopped the fence to leave the medical centre, the demolition team arrived. Unaware of our presence just moments before, they continued to transform the hospital – and the artwork within – into a pile of debris\nPhotograph: Thomas Dekeyser\n Share Share this post close Today, a new luxury development stands in place, and the hospital has moved elsewhere. With rapid development comes rapid destruction – the Last Breath project asks for a moment of reflection\nPhotograph: Bradley Garrett\n Share Share this post close Phnom Penh, Cambodia The 100 Houses Project on the outskirts of the Cambodian capital was designed by famed national architect Vann Molyvann in the 1960s. Designed on the basis of open planning to serve natural cooling, the houses stand on wooden pillars above a fish-filled pond. Today, it is still celebrated for its architectural innovation\nPhotograph: Thomas Dekeyser\n Share Share this post close Inhabitants of the development were forced out of the building in the 1970s, as Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge regime executed city-wide eviction policies in favour of agricultural communism. They never returned and the dwelling remained empty ever since. It is hoped that the erasing of this historically significant architecture through demolition will similarly erase the nation’s memory of its gruesome past. Or so the argument goes\nPhotograph: Thomas Dekeyser\n Share Share this post close When developing the 100 Houses Project, Molyvann was influenced by French culture, particularly by its characteristic social architecture. French artists Chifumi and Al Sticking painted their visual interpretations of the often-conflicting French colonial influence on local Khmer culture\nPhotograph: Thomas Dekeyser\n Share Share this post close Local artist Kong Vollak painted and sculpted skyscrapers on walls in reference to the rapidly altering skyline of Phnom Penh today. Once the exhibition was over and imagery spread online, voices of resistance rose against the destruction of the sites. Property firms and the authorities of Phnom Penh, known for their aggressive eviction tactics, remained silent, and the buildings were destroyed\nPhotograph: Thomas Dekeyser\n Share Share this post close Blackfriars, London Walking past a boarded-up building in Southwark, I encountered a 45-year-old man gaping at a ‘Demolition in progress’ danger sign. ‘I used to visit Blackfriars Cafe with my parents,’ he told me. ‘I cannot believe a part of my childhood memory is being taken away from me.’ He had been returning to the site weekly photograph the decaying walls and disappearance of the memories the building held\nPhotograph: Thomas Dekeyser\n Share Share this post close Through a neighbouring squat, we soon found an open back door to the cafe and made our way through the detritus to paint the peeling walls\nPhotograph: Thomas Dekeyser\n Share Share this post close 48 hours later, the space became semi-public with local crowds amassing to bid the cafe a final goodbye, and to forge one last memory in relation to it. The building has since been razed\nPhotograph: Thomas Dekeyser\n Share Share this post close North Melbourne The district, formerly known as Hotham, was once a working-class area. Today, it is undergoing a process of regeneration, and a wander through the area reveals its appeal to property developers. Packed with impressive Victorian-style terrace houses, factories and warehouses, the area’s many buildings have now mutated into lofts, art spaces and theatre halls\nPhotograph: Dean Sunshine\n Share Share this post close Peeking through the window of a warehouse set for demolition, I was approached by a passerby who told me the area had completely lost its unique feel. In promoting the exhibition, locals were invited through online messages and messages on the facade of the boarded-up warehouse. The owner of the building later invited the Last Breath project to photograph and film the demolition of the building\nPhotograph: Dean Sunshine\n Share Share this post close While all of the sites appeared vacant at first, there were always signs of life to be found inside. Sometimes these were just remainders of the possessions of previous inhabitants and other times these were the signs of squatters and graffiti artists who had temporarily reclaimed the spaces. Like embalmers preparing the deceased for burial, artists decorate the building for a final, fond farewell\nPhotograph: Thomas Dekeyser\n Share Share this post close", "external_links":
