Other ministers in attendance were Jean Paul Adam Minister for Finance, Trade and Blue Economy and Alain St.Ange, the Minister for Tourism and Culture. \nThe meeting that was held at the Offices of the Tourism Board at ESPACE Building was attended by representatives from Seychelles Hospitality and Tourism Association (SHTA), Seychelles Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI), Air Seychelles, Seychelles Civil and Aviation Authorities (SCCA), Seychelles Tourism Board (STB) and tourism partners opened discussions on Seychelles’ tourism policies regarding China and discussed what Seychelles as a country wanted to achieve from the Chinese market and the numbers of Chinese visitor’s Seychelles was targeting. \nPrivate sector representatives felt it was fundamental that these points are tabled and a common consensus reached, in a bid to harmonise and for Seychelles to build a cohesive approach for its presence on the Chinese market. \nSeychelles, which has long been dependent on its major source market in Europe, bringing 66 % of business to the country, is more than ever convinced it needs to diversify and remain robust to withstand politico-economic shocks from its European market. \nChina brought 13 thousand visitors to Seychelles in 2014. Today China’s estimated population is over 1.3 billion. The Tourism Strategy meeting achieved consensus that Seychelles does not need a huge number of Chinese visitors, but enough traffic to fill its flights and the 11 thousand beds in the country. \nRepresentatives of the Tourism Strategy meeting also agreed the time had come for Seychelles to move away from the policy of working to attract Chinese Chartered flights but to instead prepare to launch direct non-stop regular weekly flights and work across the board with Chinese Tour Operators (TO’s) selling the destinations and the region. It was highlighted with one weekly regular flight; Seychelles can bring 10 thousand Chinese visitors annually. \nClosing the Chinese market chapter, Air Seychelles announced it strategy to launch its winter schedule flights to China during the course of the year. On the Indian market, representatives of the Tourism Strategy meeting agreed Seychelles should lure more Indian holiday makers to its shores and increase the visitor’s arrival figures two fold on this market. Seychelles is receiving about 6 thousand travellers annually from India and this despite the four direct weekly flights. \nOne major point that came out in the discussions on the Indian market is the need to raise Seychelles’ visibility on the market at the same time as the current applicable airfare being offered by Air Seychelles on this market is reviewed. \nIt was agreed the Indian strategy should target honeymooners, which represent 90 % of the market segment for Seychelles. \nSeychelles said members of Tourism Strategic Meeting should also define a key message which will drive marketing of the destination in India. The Tourism Strategic meeting was a recommendation by Vice President Danny Faure at multi-sectoral meeting held Friday July 3rd.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T11:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T21:32:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
