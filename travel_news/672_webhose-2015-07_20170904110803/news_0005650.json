Australian travel agents have been invited to apply for the “All Stars” trade famil, which runs from 7 to 13 September.\nThe 400 successful agents will come together in Auckland for a welcome event and to participate in an educational workshop run in conjunction with regional tourism organisations from around the country, before embarking on a journey through New Zealand.\nTourism New Zealand(TNZ) General Manager Australia Tony Saunders said following the success of last year’s Mega Famil, the partners are geared to host an even bigger and better event.\n“We are thrilled to provide this exceptional platform for agents to engage with New Zealand’s travel industry – enabling them to confidently sell New Zealand. No amount of training can ever replace experiencing New Zealand first hand, which is why a famil is key to creating passionate, confident travel sellers. Results from previous Tourism New Zealand-run famils have clearly demonstrated increased value and conversion of sales to New Zealand – when compared to those agents who haven’t been on famil.\n“The agents will visit the North and South Islands during the off-peak month of September – as part of Tourism New Zealand’s (TNZ) commitment to grow shoulder season travel and wider regional spread of visitors to New Zealand.“By demonstrating to agents what a shoulder season holiday looks like, they will be more able to sell the same holiday to their clients.”\nThe 21 itineraries will see travel agents enjoying a range of activities with skiing, cycling, food, wine and conference and incentive themes.Air New Zealand General Manager Australia Leanne Geraghty said the trade plays a key role in raising awareness of New Zealand as a destination and the ease of trans-Tasman travel.\n“Together with our alliance partner Virgin Australia we operate more than 200 flights each week providing customers with seamless frequency across the Tasman and onward connectivity to the 22 domestic New Zealand destinations that Air New Zealand operates to. We have many exciting developments to share with the agents including showcasing our brand new Sydney international Airport lounge and Premium Economy offering across the Tasman. We look forward to welcoming the successful Australian travel agents to New Zealand.”\nVirgin Australia’s General Manager Global Sales, Shirley Field, said “Trans-Tasman routes are a strong focus for us, with our recently launched award-winning Business Class and a strong alliance with Air New Zealand. We look forward to welcoming key industry influencers on board.”\nTourism New Zealand (TNZ) and Air New Zealand will also use the familiarisation to New Zealand as a way to raise awareness of its 100% Pure New Zealand Specialist Programme and the Air New Zealand online training modules.\nSource:- Tourism New Zealand\nRelated Posts PROMPERÚ to tap Indian travel market Kerala Tourism to host roadshows across Australia and New Zealand World-Renowned Voices Jet In For Conflict Conference TIA welcomes the New Zealand Story New Urban Adventure in Singapore makes stopover sightseeing easy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T11:27:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
