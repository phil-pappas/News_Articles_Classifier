Photograph by: AP Photo , Gregory Bull, File \nWith an average of 250 days of sunshine a year, any time is good to visit San Diego – but summer means the waters are warm enough for surfing without a wetsuit. It’s also when this Navy port goes wild over firework shows and beach fire pits. Here’s the latest. \nWHAT’S NEW \nA nine-storey public library and its signature dome opened in San Diego in 2013. It is an architectural gem with the glassand-steel building flowing seamlessly between indoor and outdoor spaces. \nA three-storey reading room with giant windows gives a sweeping view of Coronado Bridge spanning across the bay. \nThe library and nearby Petco Park baseball stadium have revived the downtown neighbourhood, bringing in shops and cafés. \nAnother new attraction on the nearby waterfront is an open-air fish market held on a pier in Seaport Village every Saturday from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. \nCLASSIC ATTRACTIONS \nIf Andy Griffith’s Mayberry had a beach twin it would be Coronado. The bike-friendly peninsula that feels like a postcard from the 1950s is anchored by the iconic Hotel Del Coronado , which was featured in Marilyn Monroe’s 1958 film Some Like It Hot . Built in 1888, the redroofed hotel is the last of California’s Victorian seaside resorts. It looks out onto 2.4 kilometres of pristine coast with a beach that sparkles with the mineral mica. \nAnother bucket-list attraction is Balboa Park . The 485-hectare city park is home to yet another bucket-list item – the San Diego Zoo. \nThe park is celebrating its 100th anniversary, marking when its cluster of Spanish Renaissance-style buildings were erected in 1915 for a world fair to commemorate the opening of the Panama Canal. \nMuseums are hosting concerts and special events throughout 2015. Check celebratebalboapark.org . \nSan Diego’s coast boasts worldclass surfing but also decent waves for the novice. There is a slew of surf schools. Best bet is to look online or head to neighbourhoods like Mission Beach or Pacific Beach. \nOr grab a local craft beer and nachos at the WaveHouse on Mission Beach, which hosts competitions of surfers flipping in the air off its machine-churned pool waves, with a view of the real thing in the Pacific. \nTIPS \nIt’s best to have a car to navigate the sprawling city. Parking downtown means paying at either a meter or parking garage, but in most other parts of the city, street parking is free. \nAl fresco dining is a must-do. For a cheap breakfast or lunch visit a farmers market. There are several daily. Check out sdfarmbureau.org . \nLocals grab a bundle of wood at the grocery stores and roast hotdogs at one of the permanent fire pits set up along San Diego’s bays. Another popular, evening picnic spot from spring through fall is at the Velodrome in Balboa Park . \nHANGING OUT \nSan Diego’s Little Italy section is a prime spot for enjoying a good espresso and people watching. The hilly, picturesque downtown neighbourhood is a hip, bustling mecca of shops, art galleries and cafés.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T20:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T02:19:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
