Passengers can now travel bag-free, resulting in quicker, lighter and stress free journeys. \nDeparting travellers with an afternoon or evening flight can be free to make the most of their departure day, leaving it later before making the journey to the airport as they no longer have to factor in extra time carrying their heavy luggage. \nArriving passengers offload their bags with the AirPortr team when they land and travel straight to their destination, avoiding carrying luggage around with them all day. \nGatwick Product Manager for Premium and Business Services Toby Tait said: \n\"Gatwick is always striving to make our passengers' travel through our airport quick, convenient and hassle-free. \nThe arrival of AirPortr now means that the convenience our passengers experience at the airport extends to their travel to and from Gatwick. Carrying heavy bags on the journey to and from the airport can now be a thing of the past for our passengers.\" \nHead of Customer Experience at Portr Chris Walsh said: \n\"Since launching the AirPortr experience we have overwhelmingly seen how the service literally changes the way people now plan and make their journeys. \nOf course we are in the business of same day luggage delivery and ensuring your bags travel when and where you want them, but really AirPortr is all about the time and convenience aspect of the service that we in reality aspire to deliver. \nMore time to do what you want and need to do versus having your luggage inconveniently dictating your itinerary i.e. what we like to think is truly travelling with 'Luggage Freedom'.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T22:30:15.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
