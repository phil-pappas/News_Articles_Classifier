He is believed to have undergone tests for HIV and hepatitis. \nA 38-year-old man appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court in connection with the incident yesterday. \nThe Scotsman hotel source described how the tourist ran into the reception from the street and pleaded for help. \nThey said: “He had been outside and a guy asked him for a pound. \n“He said he didn’t have money on him. Then he just came into the hotel and asked if they could order a taxi because he needed to go to hospital. He had a big hole in his belly.” \nA police spokeswoman said: “Police received a report of an assault on North Bridge that occurred on Saturday. \n“A 36-year-old man subsequently attended the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary where he received treatment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T22:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T22:46:24.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
