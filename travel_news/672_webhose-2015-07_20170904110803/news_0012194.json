This announcement came following the meeting between the two presidents in Washington where they discussed bilateral cooperation, including expansion of trade and investment between the two countries. \n\nIn a joint statement, the Heads of State announced the decision by the Brazilian government to participate in the “Global Entry” program. The Presidents committed to work closely together to meet the requirements of both the United States Visa Waiver Program and Brazil’s applicable legislation to enable American and Brazilian citizens visa-free travel. \n\nThe Global Entry program makes it easier for Brazilians to travel to the United States by providing expedited clearance for pre-approved travelers, an important step to the eventual entry of Brazil into the U.S. Visa Waiver Program (VWP) as part of a U.S.-Brazil Trusted Traveler Program. The VWP would further facilitate travel between the U.S. and Brazil by eliminating the need to secure travel visas for temporary visits between the two countries. \n\n“At Hilton Worldwide, we embrace efforts to increase hassle-free, safe travel between countries,” said Christopher J. Nassetta, President and CEO of Hilton Worldwide. “Making it easier for business travelers to travel between the United States and Brazil could lead to record-breaking trade and investment opportunities in both countries, including in the hospitality industry.” \n\nIn 2014, over 2.3 million Brazilians visited the U.S., generating $13.1 billion in travel spending and supporting 75,000 American jobs. A U.S.-Brazil Trusted Traveler Program including Global Entry and the VWP has the potential to significantly increase the contribution Brazil, with a population of 200 million, has on the U.S. economy. These measures could also have a sizable economic impact within Brazil, which is seeking additional foreign business and investment as it prepares to host the 2016 Summer Olympics.
