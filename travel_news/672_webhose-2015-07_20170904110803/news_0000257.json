It’s not only the completion of the hotel we are celebrating today, it’s the completion of a massive journey that started fifteen years ago when we moved from Northlands Road to this impressive new site. In 2005, we realised to make the best out of this site we had to offer more than just a cricket ground and here we are today celebrating the opening of this magnificent Hilton Hotel.” On arrival, guests were welcomed to a performance from the Crestwood College Steel Band, prior to Rod and Catherine formally unveiling a plaque to mark the opening of the latest and most impressive development at the Ageas Bowl. Guests were then treated to an impressive display from an aerial silk performer, before enjoying a wide selection of food and drink stations, including a seafood bar and hot and cold canapés. Dominic Osborne, General Manager, Hilton at The Ageas Bowl, said: “Today we celebrate the completion of The Ageas Bowl development, which recently saw the opening of Hilton at The Ageas Bowl. It is a fantastic opportunity to look back on the great work that has been achieved so far by everyone in the project, as well as look forward to what I am sure will be a very exciting future for the home of Hampshire cricket.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T12:06:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
