One father from Ohio says he is worried that the talking Minion toy given out with McDonald's Happy Meals might teach his three-year-old son to swear. When slammed on a hard surface, the Minions are programmed to 'speak' and some believe they utter the phrase: \"what the f**k\". Taylor King from Ohio told My Fox 48 he was scared his son would begin to mimic the toy: \"I heard what it said and I'm like, 'whoa hang on here'. It clearly says what it says.\" \"My kids are old enough now where they're going to mock anything they hear from a toy. It's coming from a toy. They're going to assume it's okay to say that.\" Gibberish or cursing? (Film Still) Another father, Robert Frazier, took the toys away from his three children: \"As soon as we heard it, her mum took it away. I listened to it and that's when we found out what's what it was saying.\" One mother, Nancy Kaffer, even went so far as to say \"a little part of me died inside\" when she heard the alleged cursing. A spokesperson for McDonald's denied the suggestion that the toy is swearing: \"Minions speak Minionese, which is a random combination of languages and nonsense words and sounds.\" \"Minionese has no translation to or any meaning in any recognized language. Any perceived similarities to words within the English language are purely coincidental.\" Twitter users are divided as to whether the Minion toys are truly swearing or not. Some are adamant it is and are eager to get their hands on one. I'll go to @McDonalds to get my WTF minion. I want a swearing one! — ? LauraBizarra ? (@LauraBiZaRra) July 9, 2015 I want a swearing Minion! @McDonalds — Katrina #ckwarrior (@HHStormChaser) July 9, 2015 Others are not so easily convinced. I have a \"swearing\" Minion toy. My incredulity that anyone would think it's swearing is matched only by my disappointment that it isn't. — Josh Addison (@monkeyfluids) July 10, 2015 And some believe it's all just a clever marketing move. Actually tempted to take the kids to MDs to try to get the swearing minion. Their best marketing move in years. — Urban Foxe (@urbanfoxe) July 10, 2015 Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T14:55:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
