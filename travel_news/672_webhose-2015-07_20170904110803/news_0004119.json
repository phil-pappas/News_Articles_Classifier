They will be joined by a host of trade association heads on stage to perform the ribbon-cutting ceremony. The first-ever Macao International Gem Fair is featuring under one roof of 220 exhibitors in over 300 booths from Hong Kong, Mainland China, India, Iran, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Poland, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, UAE and the USA, etc., presenting their best offers of gems, diamonds, pearls, loose stones, raw materials, fine jewellery and other related services. Serious buyers who are looking for new supplies of finest raw materials and fine jewelry pieces from Asia will find this new trade fair just unmissable. \nMacao, dubbed Asia's Las Vegas, is an ideal place to stage the MACAO INTERNATIONAL GEM FAIR as this Chinese city provides an exciting trade fair experience that blends business with leisure. The city's duty-free port regime and its close proximity to China's big gems and jewellery, manufacturers, suppliers and wholesale centres around the Pearl River Delta Region in South China give it unrivalled advantages. The new fair will be held at the prestigious Venetian Macao Resort & Exhibition Center, the world-class hotel resort-entertainment-cum-convention and exhibition complex, now well-established as a premium trade fair venue. \nThe exhibition has gained full support from the Macao SAR Government. Apart from special subsidies offered to participating companies to join the exhibition, special visitor promotion programs to offer attractive incentives to qualified buyers, such as sponsorship for hotel accommodation and travel expenses have been launched. According to the show organisers, these sponsorship programs have successfully generated huge buyer interest and many of them pre-registered to attend the fair. An impressive number of trade visitors is expected for the four day exhibition. \nThe MACAO INTERNATIONAL GEM FAIR is positioned to serve the Asian and China gems and jewellery markets, as well as to grow business opportunities in the wider global arena. Late July is a perfect timing for jewellery designers and manufacturers to source and buy raw gems and other materials to make up their new designs and products for the many upcoming major jewellery trade exhibitions and promotional events in September. Meanwhile, it is also the great time for fine jewellery buyers to look for new supplies to cater the year-end Christmas and New Year's gift-shopping season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T03:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T11:03:04.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
