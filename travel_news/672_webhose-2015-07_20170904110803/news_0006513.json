Well, thanks to the folks at the Australian World Wildlife Fun (WWF), we can experience it too. \nThe WWF recently released a video from a turtle outfitted with a Go-Pro camera. The result shows us the famous reef like most humans will never see it, short of an expensive diving holiday expedition. \nIn the crystal-clear video, the turtle gets up close with the reef giving the viewer an astonishingly close look of the wildlife and the rocky coral. \nWWF wrote in the video’s description that the video was created to bring attention to the pollution affecting turtles within the Great Barrier Reef and to better understand the post-release behaviour of tagged green turtles. \nGet a firsthand look at what it's like to be a sea turtle swimming among the Great Barrier Reef thanks to a cleverly placed camera by the folks at the World Wildlife Fund.
