When they emerged, her body was being taken away in an ambulance. Their drug-addict father had murdered her. For 10 years afterwards, they were shunted between orphanages and foster families. David said he ran away every time. By the age of 17 he ran a team of drug dealers, first at school and then in the town of Tela, on the Caribbean coast of Honduras. He reels off the merchandise: “Cocaine, crack, weed and mushrooms.” In Honduras, that means dealing with one of the two major gangs that have carved up the drugs business between them. “I never did any killing,” he says quickly, “but I had to do business with them. I was with MS-13.” MS-13 – the Mara Salvatrucha – originated in the street gangs of Los Angeles before spreading through Central America. In Honduras, they battle the 18th Street gang for dominance. David told his story in the shade of a Llama del Bosque (flame of the forest) tree, in the gardens of a rehabilitation centre. For the past three months he has been helped by Project Victoria, a church-based programme for young men caught up with drugs, alcohol or gangs. Often they are victims of all three. David, 19, described how he was given one last chance by the director of a charity that had given him a home for the last of his teenage years. It meant telling his gang that he wanted out. “They said they would give me a chance but that if they ever caught me dealing drugs then they would kill me,” he says. He hopes to use his second chance to continue his education by going to university and eventually finding a job in agriculture. They said that if they ever caught me dealing drugs then they would kill me Kenco, through its Coffee vs Gangs programme , has also been trying to get young people out of gang culture, teaching them how to become coffee entrepreneurs. David spoke quietly and with a quick wit. He did not seem like a hardened gang member, but his life story illustrates the way the country’s drug and crime lords prey on the vulnerable. When you have no job, no money, no prospects or no family, the idea of making a fast buck is a huge temptation, explains Rafael Mejia, who runs Project Victoria in San Pedro Sula. “This is a drug-trafficking route and it offers them the opportunity of an easy life,” he says in his office, which looks across the sun-scorched gardens to a football pitch and church beyond. “Everyone wants nice shoes, a nice phone, Tommy Hilfiger. So these young men can take a small package and earn 10,000 lempira [$500] just for an errand.” At any one time he is responsible for 25 to 30 young men undergoing the project’s strict regime of spiritual guidance, physical exercise and counselling. The day begins at 5.30am and everyone is expected to do their fair share of chores. “When they come here, the only thing that we ask of them is that they are volunteers, that they come of their own free will,” he says. Most are struggling with alcohol or drugs. Mr Mejia is a graduate himself, having been brought in for treatment in 1985 by his father, who hunted him down in San Pedro Sula – far from his home in the capital, Tegucigalpa – and found him passed out in a street after another bout of drinking and sniffing paint thinners. He said things were much tougher for young people today, who also have to cope with the pressure of the gangs and a more potent mix of drugs. “I don’t think I would be alive if I have got into crack,” he says. • To discover more about the Coffee vs Gangs project and read about gang culture in Honduras, visit telegraph.co.uk/coffeevsgangs You may also be interested in: • Video: Visiting the Coffee vs Gangs farm • The Honduras coffee region by numbers • Coffee production: from seedling to coffee cup", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T19:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T13:59:29.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
