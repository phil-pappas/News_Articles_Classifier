Health officials will issue a new blueprint this autumn promising a new model of care, and national standards on how the helpline should work with ambulances, GP out of hours and urgent care providers. NHS England’s chief operating officer has written to all providers and commissioners of 111 services, calling for all current tender processes to be halted, until a new “functionally integrated” service has been designed. The letter was issued last Friday, two days after The Telegraph disclosed concerns about the way 111 helplines are being run. South Central Ambulance Service launched an inquiry after an undercover investigation found call handlers being put under pressure to avoid sending ambulances. Some told how they phrased questions so as to minimise health concerns. A Telegraph reporter, who spent four weeks training to work in the centre, found that the computer system did not dispatch an ambulance even when symptoms could be those of a heart attack. The 111 helpline, run by ambulance services, private firms and social enterprises, has been dogged by controversy after a series of failings as it was rolled out nationally, two years ago. It was intended to relieve pressure on Accident & Emergency (A&E) departments and to help ensure patients were directed to the best place for help. However, senior doctors say the service is in fact fuelling an increase in A&E attendances, because call handlers without clinical training are advising too many patients with trivial health concerns to go to hospital. • NHS 111 investigation: 10 things we've learned • NHS 111 investigation: Helpline refuses to send ambulances - as it happened Meanwhile, too many serious cases are being missed, patients groups say. The letter by Dr Barbara Hakin, NHS England chief operating officer, orders the immediate suspension of all tendering processes involving 111 and out-of-hours services. It promises a new model of care, to ensure a “functionally integrated urgent care access, treatment and clinical advice service” and national standards to ensure patient quality. The letter, seen by Health Service Journal, says: “Further procurements of NHS 111 and OOH (out of hours) services should be suspended, whatever stage of the procurement has been reached, until the end of September, to allow completion of the consultation and the release of the revised commissioning standards and supporting procurement advice for integrated services.” NHS England chief operating officer Dr Barbara Hakin It suggests that the new services should join together 111 and GP out of hours services, along with other urgent care services. In some areas all services are run by one organisation, but in others, different contracts are given to a variety of bodies. Health officials suggested that the services should be planned across larger areas, with one organisation given lead responsibility to take charge of them. Katherine Murphy, chief executive from the Patients Association, (above) said; “NHS 111 has repeatedly failed the public. We need to be able to have confidence in the new system; I am glad that NHS England is taking a hard look at the service, but we really need to get it right this time.” South Central Ambulance Service last week launched a review of the allegations about patient safety which a spokesman said last night is still ongoing.
