Kennedy International Airports voted unanimously to strike starting tonight. Workers took the vote on Monday, but the news was announced Tuesday in a press release sent out 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, which is backing the workers. The strike is aimed specifically at Aviation Safeguards, a company said to be a subcontractor for Delta Air Lines. Security officers, baggage handlers and wheelchair attendants will walk off the job starting at 10 p.m. at JFK. The strike hits LaGuardia on Thursday morning at 6 a.m. with an event that will feature supporters, including Reverend Al Sharpton . A spokesman for the union said the strike would continue until a vote to end it. The strike primarily impacts Delta operations at the two airports. Delta has a big presence at two of LaGuardia's terminals, taking most of the gates at Terminal C and all of them at Terminal D. At JFK, Delta operates international and transcontinental flights out of Terminal Four and other domestic flights out of Terminal Two. The union charges that the contractors were mistreated and their concerns of a prevailing wage were ignored. Among the demands is a payment of $15 per hour, up from the current $10.10 they make now. Both airports are huge travel hubs both domestically and internationally. JFK served an estimated 53.2 million passengers in 2014, while LaGuardia served 26.9 million. The security workers for Aviation Safeguards going on strike aren't from the federal Transportation Security Administration, who handle bags and security checks; rather they are in charge of the entries and hallways of the airports. \nWant Albany Human Resources news in your inbox?
