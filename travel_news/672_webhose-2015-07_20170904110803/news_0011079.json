The China Pavilion at the Milan Expo, which runs until the end of October, was based on a design proposal devised by Su, vice-dean of Tsinghua University’s art school, and his team. “National pavilions at each world expo are the indicators of the latest development in architecture. They not only showcase a country’s prowess in technology, but also the evolution of its culture,” he said. “In a nutshell, it mirrors a country’s image. So it’s always a challenge for designers, especially when you design for a country that has a long and rich history and a diverse culture.” Many of the 140 countries that participated in this year’s expo were expected to go with bold designs for their pavilions, all aiming to impress, but Mr Su said it was a challenge his team — made up of about 30 professors from top Chinese design schools — embraced with a different approach. The theme for the China Pavilion was “The Land of Hope”. The roof is shaped like a cresting ocean wave, made up of opaque glass-like shingles, while surrounding the building is an LED installation that creates the illusion of a large wheat field, to represent China’s farming culture. We wanted to build an image of modern China, a big country full of energy and a promising future “The image we’re trying to deliver is rather contemporary,” the design director said, adding that the pavilion perfectly reflected the theme of the Milan Expo, “Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life”. According to Mr Su, the Chinese pavilion for the 2010 Shanghai Expo, known as the Oriental Crown because of its resemblance to an ancient Chinese crown, was an expression of China via a giant symbol. He said that was something his team did not want to repeat. “We wanted to build an image of modern China, a big country full of energy and a promising future,” he said. The team did not intentionally set out to design an attention-grabbing form, added chief architect Lu Yichen, principal at New York design company Studio Link-Arc and an associate professor at Tsinghua. “We wanted to highlight the experience and quality of the space,” he said. “For us, this was the most important part.” China’s Milan Expo pavilion features many Chinese characteristics throughout its wooden structure, such as the interior bamboo roof panels. Su said the design concept was loosely based on I Ching , also known as the Book of Changes , a collection of ancient Chinese philosophies originally from the Western Zhou Dynasty (1046 BC - 771 BC). The building specifically followed the message in the book about parallels and the close relationships between heaven and earth and humans. “In our building the roof represents heaven, the wheat field is earth, and the exhibition that shows China’s civilisation is a reflection of human activity,” Mr Su explained. The relationship between heaven and earth and humans, and how they live together in harmony, was what made Tsinghua’s design proposal stand out from the other 13 submissions, he said. The design was completed in late 2013 after almost six months of work. “Building a project outside China is an unprecedented challenge for us. You need to guarantee smooth communication between the design team and overseas construction teams. But no matter how hard you try, unexpected incidents happen from time to time,” he said, admitting he had not had a good night’s sleep in months. “There were delays in construction, and the austerity campaign by the central government put limits on our budget,” he said. Reviews of the pavilion were initially positive, and Mr Su, who has won awards for his designs, said he was confident that the 20 million visitors expected to see it before October 31 would be given a fresh impression of China. “We’ve already taken all the elements — the summer temperatures and Italy’s Mediterranean climate — into account to achieve the best results with what we have,” he said. “Imagine Italy’s summer light through the bamboo roof of the pavilion, shining upon the golden wheat field. The view is breathtaking.” This article was originally produced and published by China Daily.
