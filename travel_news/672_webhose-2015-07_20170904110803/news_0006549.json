Egg on face!\n— Jeff Kennett (@jeff_kennett) July 24, 2015 Carey came in for a wave of criticism from fans and appeared to stun his fellow commentators when he offered: “Just having a look at Sam Mitchell, I want to ask you a question, would he get a game at any other club? ... Don’t get me wrong, I think he’s an absolute champion, but if you’re in a lesser team, a team that’s not winning, you’re expected to put pressure on and his pace doesn’t allow him to do it.”\n“In any other team his pace would be a concern. If you put him in this Carlton team they would say he doesn’t put enough pressure on.”\nThe comments were immediately contested by fellow commentator Cameron Ling, who said in almost disbelief: “He would get a game at all 17 other clubs ... I strongly disagree.”\nRonaldo wouldn't get a game in the A-League #thingstheducksays\n— Adam Karim (@adam__karim) July 24, 2015 Speaking on Channel 7 after the match, the man himself — Mitchell — didn’t seem too fazed by Carey’s comments.\n“What can you say? He (Carey) is a media person and he is paid to have an opinion. If that is his opinion, that is fine. There is nothing I can say,” Mitchell said.\n“I can’t say he wouldn’t have got a game because probably other than ‘Lethal’ (Leigh Matthews), he was probably the greatest player to play the game. I will work on my speed — I suppose.”\nHORROR SHOW: SHOULD BLUES BE BANISHED FROM FRIDAY NIGHTS?\nHowever throughout the night the man known as ‘Duck’ was doing just that as critics came for him.\nTerry Wallace tweeted: “the worst call in history from Wayne Carey! Sam Mitchell is in the best 3 mids I’ve ever seen at Hawthorn.”\nAdelaide star Patrick Dangerfield helped to get the hashtag #thingstheducksays trending on Twitter soon after by offering up two doozies.\nDangerfield’s first: “Bronwyn Bishop’s helicopter flight from Melb to Geelong was taxpayers’ money well spent.” He followed it up with: “Steve Smith is an average cricketer and wouldn’t make England’s test side.”\nSteve smith is an average cricketer and wouldn't make England's test side. #thingstheducksays #samMitchell\n— Patrick Dangerfield (@dangerfield32) July 24, 2015 People have questioned Mitchell’s pace since he was a short, squat kid playing for Mooroolbark, and each time he has been questioned across 276 AFL games, he has proved those doubts to be absolute folly.\nMitchell has won four club best-and-fairest awards (only Leigh Matthews has won more than that) and such has been his form this year that another might not be beyond the realms; he has been second in the Brownlow Medal; and he has won countless other awards and honours in a career that stamps him one of the club’s greatest players.\nCarey was talking mainly about Mitchell’s leg speed in 2015, but internally the Hawks have seen nothing from his output to suggest he has slowed up ever an ounce.\nExposed dyna bolts are a great innovation & should introduced at all AFL venues #ThingsTheDuckSays\n— Christian Wallace (@Wally_NMFC) July 24, 2015 That’s why he already has a signed contract to play again for the Hawks next year and is still a chance to play on again in 2017.\nMitchell has had an outstanding season this year, having 35 touches last night, and a total of 458 disposals from his 15 games this year.\nIt was one of those weird sort of nights, when a soccer game at the other end of town attracted almost 100,000 fans, while a flat, almost disinterested crowd of 26,815 fans at Etihad Stadium watched the latest in the long lost of miserable spectacles in what is meant to be the most precious and prestigious timeslot in the game.\n@tj_nelson7 Michael Jordan was a better player at the Wizards than the Bulls #thingstheducksays\n— Craig Subocz (@CraigSubocz) July 24, 2015 Perhaps the King was just trying to divert the attention from Carlton’s woeful performance on a night in which they were meant to honour the men who played in the club’s last premiership side in 1995.\nPerhaps he was trying to look after Barker, who didn’t deserve the lack of effort and lack of care from the Carlton players last night.\nPerhaps he is just wrong on a bloke who has turned a perceived lack of pace into one of the best modern AFL careers.\nBronwyn Bishop's helicopter flight from Melb to Geelong was tax players money well spent. #thingstheducksays\n— Patrick Dangerfield (@dangerfield32) July 24, 2015 Sacking Ratten was a stroke of genius #thingstheducksays #AFLBluesHawks\n— Dana (@DanaGrgas) July 24, 2015 Todd Goldstein's impact on Supercoach leagues last week was overblown #thingstheducksays\n— Lance Jenkinson (@westsport) July 24, 2015 @dangerfield32 the phantom menace is by far the greatest Star Wars film #thingstheducksays\n— Mark Broadley (@MarkBroadley) July 24, 2015 Gary Ablett Sr was too short to play key forward in any other team #thingstheducksays\n— Rodney Purves (@RodMunch21) July 24, 2015 Lord of the Sky is a moral #thingstheducksays\n— Trevor Goodison (@TrevyG82) July 24, 2015 I enjoy sitting on a cold toilet seat #thingstheducksays\n— Danny Williams (@Dwill2312) July 24, 2015 Carlton will play another 6+ Friday night games in season 2016 #thingstheducksays\n— Daniel Mackertich (@Mackaa7) July 24, 2015 Originally published as Clarko King hits Carey’s opinion", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TrevyG82/status/624539158950731777", "https://twitter.com/Mackaa7/status/624534384327012352", "https://twitter.com/CraigSubocz/status/624542907702374404", "https://twitter.com/DanaGrgas/status/624539976064077824", "https://twitter.com/Dwill2312/status/624538919518928896", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/AFLBluesHawks?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/MarkBroadley/status/624567924519350272", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/samMitchell?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/dangerfield32", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ThingsTheDuckSays?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/westsport/status/624545527808405504", "https://twitter.com/tj_nelson7", "https://twitter.com/jeff_kennett/status/624554927742783488", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/thingstheducksays?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/dangerfield32/status/624532535658221569", "https://twitter.com/dangerfield32/status/624533798584238080", "https://twitter.com/adam__karim/status/624549500577689601", "https://twitter.com/RodMunch21/status/624539864940150785", "https://twitter.com/Wally_NMFC/status/624547303731261440", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/wayne-carey-says-sam-mitchell-might-struggle-to-get-game-at-other-afl-clubs/story-fni5f8ge-1227456217571"], "published": "2015-07-25T20:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T07:01:38.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
