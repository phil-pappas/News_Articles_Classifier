More Ladbrokes and Coral confirm merger \nIt previously forecast mid-single digit growth in ebitda this year. The financial impact of the accident, which left four people seriously injured, may last into 2016, it added. \nNick Varney, Merlin chief executive, said the June 2 accident on the Smiler ride, not only “stopped the momentum” at the theme parks as they were entering their peak period but the expected pick-up in attendance in the past few weeks had not materialised. \n“Just as we could have been going at full throttle, we had to stop the engines and that took all the momentum out of the market,” he said. Some marketing and promotion has since resumed but it has not had the desired effect on revenues. \n“We were expecting it to move the needle and it hasn’t,” said Mr Varney. \nHe declined to say by how much visitor numbers had fallen and said it was not clear how long it would take for “residual concerns to work their way through the system”, suggesting the impact would linger into 2016. “In 12 to 18 months’ time I believe Alton Towers will be back where it was,” he said. \nThe cost base would not be cut, he said, because that would be hard to reverse if visitor numbers did recover. \nAnalysts at Shore Capital said the downgrade was larger than expected. “However, we are encouraged by the better trading elsewhere and while not trying to trivialise the tragic events, historically theme parks around the globe have recovered relatively quickly from such events,” they wrote in a note. “At this stage we think this [accident] remains a one off event that should be treated as such.” \nMerlin’s share price fell 8 per cent to 390p in early trading, its biggest one-day fall according to Reuters, before recovering to 403p. \nRevenues have also been hit by the weakening euro deterring visitors to London, particularly at Merlin’s Madame Tussauds waxworks museum. \n“We expect there will be a lot less British holidaymakers in London and a lot less French, German, Italian and Spanish holidaymakers in London,” Mr Varney said. \nVisitor numbers at Thorpe Park, where rides were also closed after the Smiler accident, have picked up faster than at Alton Towers. \nRevenues at Legoland, another major Merlin-run theme park, have been strong, Mr Varney said. \nAt the group level, Merlin said the impact of the losses at the theme parks would be partially offset by better than expected financing costs, central cost savings and improved trading elsewhere in the group. Underlying profit before tax this year is expected to be broadly in line with last year’s £249m. \nMr Varney said he had not come under shareholder pressure to step down. “We’ve had one tragic accident in the company’s history that shouldn’t have happened,” he said. “We’re putting that right but it doesn’t take away from the fact that this is a very strong business. It will just take a period of time to recover.” \nAdditional reporting by Naomi Rovnick Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015. You may share using our article tools.
