It’s a wrist band that tracks movement and translates it into what Nike calls “Fuel”. Users can set daily goals for how much movement that they want to achieve. The band can connect wirelessly to a smartphone app and its features include a pedometer and a clock. Nike hasn’t disclosed sales figures. Last year, it laid off some employees who worked on the devices but said it would continue to make them.\nThe lawsuit said the companies engaged in false advertising because they knew the devices could not track steps, calories or NikeFuel as accurately as they claimed. The lawsuit also alleged breaches of the terms of the devices’ warranty.\nApple Inc. and Nike did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n 28, 2015 12:24 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T12:17:48.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
