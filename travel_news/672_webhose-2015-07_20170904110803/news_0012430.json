The Belvedere is one of the most iconic hotels in Mykonos and the spa opening supports our vision of reconnecting our guests with themselves, others and some of the most beautiful locations around the world. In all our treatments, the hotel and local guests will find an intuitive mix of science and human awareness, where our high-tech and high-touch approach defines a service that is always crafted around the individual,” said Anna Bjurstam, vice president spas & wellness. \nOpening in early July, the spa has been inspired by the hotel’s stylish and contemporary design, reflecting the traditional Myconian architecture with a contemporary interpretation. Locally-inspired features such as whitewashed walls and marble floors sourced from the neighboring island of Naxos have been used throughout the spa. Special attention has been given to the local craftsmanship with the classic white interiors being complemented by beautiful wooden shelving carved by a local artisan. Natural fabrics in shades of Aegean blue and white together with soft lighting add warm highlights to the spa’s natural palette to evoke the serenity of the island. There is an open-plan spa reception area with a vaulted ceiling, comfortable seating and beautifully-crafted retail displays that lead guests throughout the spa like a silent guide. The three treatment rooms, one double and two single, feature steam showers and daybeds. For nail aficionados, there’s an intimate manicure area plus a separate pedicure area with seating built into the floor and wall. Several frosted glass skylights provide additional splashes of the Aegean’s special natural light. Six Senses Spa offers a layered approach to wellness that unites a pioneering spirit with treatments that go beyond ordinary. The spa’s highly skilled therapists take guests as deep as they would like to go, from core beauty that can redefine the way they look to specialist treatments that can transform their lives. There is a wide selection of Six Senses signature massages, body treatments, rituals as well as beauty services on offer. Local ingredients such as cinnamon leaf and bark oils, honey and the finest sand from the Adriatic Sea have provided inspiration for an anti-inflammatory body treatment, while aniseed, sesame and olive oils are used in a head-to-toe cleansing therapy, and pomegranate, sea salt, grape seed and fig in an anti-oxidant body cocoon. There is a range of result-driven face and body treatments from The Organic Pharmacy designed to restore, energize and nourish the body and mind. This renowned organic skincare is based on homeopathic and herbal medicine with the principles that the quality of the ingredients and the purity of the formulation are paramount as well as dosage.
