You only have to see the faces of the parents at school sports days to know many of them wish they were taking part themselves. Even if your school days are long gone, there’s nothing to stop you competing in a sack race or powering up the home straight in a hopping race. It’s simple to revisit your childhood by laying on your own sports day and bringing family or friends together for some good old-fashioned nonsense games. You need to decide a date, pick a venue (the local park or playing fields are ideal) and invite your competitors in plenty of time. On the day itself, divide your teams in the best way to make it a close contest. It could be boys versus girls or children versus adults with a cunning handicap system to even things up. Or in time-honoured playground fashion, you could select captains who then choose their team members in turn. Just about any sports equipment can be turned into a school sports day challenge Taking part in a race where you have to throw on random items of clothing and accessories before crossing the finishing line is always a great leveller, too. You could also put that shed full of toys to good use, then sit back and enjoy watching your fellow adults struggle. Relay races bouncing along on spacehoppers or the 100m dash on your six-year-old’s scooter can prove tricky for grown-ups. Or why not blow up that beach ball and try and do a sprint with it between your legs? Just about any sports equipment can be turned into a challenge. Running races while bouncing a tennis ball on a racquet, dribbling a football through cones while blindfolded or flinging a welly might not be Olympic disciplines but will go down a storm at your event. If you have space, why not finish the contest with game of rounders or a penalty shootout? Meanwhile, fire up the barbecue and keep the drinks chilling in the cool box as the action unfolds. Once everyone has finished displaying their sporting prowess, it’s time to munch a burger, sip a beer and mull over how you blew it in the beanbag race.
