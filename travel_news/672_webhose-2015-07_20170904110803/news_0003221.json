Here's where to go... \n-- \nBest for beaches - Zakynthos \nThe Ionian Islands can't be beaten for sandy beaches backed by dramatic coastlines. Myrtos Beach on Kefalonia and Porto Katsiki on Lefkada are among the most photogenic, but Shipwreck Bay on Zakythos, only accessible by boat, trumps them both - even if it does get a bit crowded. \n\"Visitors to Zakynthos should avoid the boozy corners of the south coast and stick to the beautiful, unspoilt north and mountainous west of the island,\" says Telegraph Travel's Joanna Symons. \"Or base yourself on the pine-forested Vasilikos peninsula in the south-east, most of which has been protected from large-scale development because of the loggerhead turtles that breed on Gerakas beach.\" \nGerakas itself is \"a perfect curve of golden sand\", she adds. \"Those turtles know how to pick a good spot.\" \n-- \nLate deal \nThomas Cook (0844 412 5970; thomascook.com ) is offering seven nights at the four-star Smartline Margarita in Zakythos for Â£599 per person on an all-inclusive basis. Price is for two adults sharing a double room and includes return flight from Glasgow on August 23. \n-- \nThis article was first published on February 9, 2015, and updated on July 21, 2015.
