You’d never plan a dinner indoors with three types of meat, six side dishes, two jugs of cocktails and an array of desserts worthy of an American diner. But when it comes to barbecues we do all of the above, despite the fact that the food will be cooked after the guests have arrived and usually on a small barbecue, not a griddle the size of a grand piano. Instead of relaxed outdoor eating, we end up presiding over an event that’s as stressful as Christmas. If you want to go Middle-Eastern, get lamb sausages and serve them in pitta bread with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, chilli sauce and tzatziki When I lived in France for a while, the family I stayed with used the barbecue like an outdoor cooker. They didn’t change their style of cooking just because they were doing it outside. We enjoyed, night after night, chops, steaks and kebabs that had been cooked on a barbie so basic you could have picked it up at a petrol station. We tend to forget that barbecuing is about the irresistible flavour of charred flesh – whether it’s meat or big fat red peppers – so complicating matters detracts from the very thing we’re celebrating. My French experience made me rethink my approach to outdoor cooking; these are my guidelines. Choose one meat. If you have kids coming as well as adults – and you feel they won’t want the adult offerings – do sausages, but partially cook them beforehand (by poaching them). That way they won’t take too much time. Grown-ups get annoyed waiting for food at barbecues. Children become positively unpleasant. Prior cooking means you won’t end up with burst, charred casings and uncooked centres either. I love hot dogs and if I ended up at a barbecue where only sausages were available – as long as they were good ones – I’d be delighted. Chorizo-style sausages – spiced with smoked paprika – are fabulous shoved into a bun with fried onions, slices of lime-sprinkled avocado, cold cucumber and salad. If you want to go Middle-Eastern, get lamb sausages and serve them in pitta bread with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, chilli sauce and loads of tzatziki. As for afters, there are so many great sorbets, so just get some good tubs in. Citrusy ones are best as they’re the most cleansing after a meat feast Beyond sausages, what meat should you choose? I’m very keen on lamb. It is best served rare or medium so you don’t have to panic about whether it’s cooked well enough. Lamb kebabs are excellent – marinate the meat with cumin, cinnamon, lemon, olive oil and crushed garlic – and serve with the accompaniments suggested for the lamb sausages above, plus roasted peppers and spiced carrot purée (purée cooked carrots with a little of their cooking liquid, cumin, cayenne pepper, olive oil and lemon juice). If you want to serve chicken – and it’s the most economical meat – then cook boned thighs. They’re juicier than breasts and are much less likely to dry out. Just bash them between pieces of cling film or greaseproof paper to flatten them a bit. A marinade of crushed garlic, lemon juice and olive oil is all they need. Flavoured butters (mash butter with thyme and paprika or parsley and garlic and chill) are lovely melted over the griddled flesh. For side dishes, I do something starchy – a salad of brown and wild rice, couscous, bulgur wheat, or a good potato salad – and a big green salad. As for afters, there are so many great sorbets, so just get some good tubs in. Citrusy ones are best as they’re the most cleansing after a meat feast. If you want to offer fruit as well, toss sliced mangoes with the pulp of several passion fruit. So remember – keep it simple. Successful barbecues require restraint.
