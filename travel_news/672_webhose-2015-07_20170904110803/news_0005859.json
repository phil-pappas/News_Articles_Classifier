He confirmed that Saeb and Ali Fayad were brothers, but did not comment on the incident. \nMedia reports said security cameras were being examined to find out the direction in which the five tourists and the driver went after the car was abandoned 300 meters passed a military checkpoint at dawn in the West Bekaa town of Kefraya. \nThe Fayyad family, which has held protests earlier this year outside the U.S. and Czech embassies calling for Ali’s release, was not available for comment. \nThe five Czech nationals, aged between 25 and 47, had entered Lebanon twice during the past few months, a security source said Saturday. They first entered Lebanon on May 15 and left on July 1, and reentered the country on July 7, the source added. \nEarlier reports said Fayyad was a taxi driver with a legally registered car, but photos obtained by The Daily Star Sunday showed the car bore a white license plate, indicating the car was registered for private use rather than for public transportation. Registered taxis and buses in Lebanon must carry a red license plate \nLuggage, including a leather bag that contained Lebanese, Czech and European currencies, and three cameras were found strewn across the car. The cameras, one of them a video recorder, are believed to belong to the five missing Czechs. \nLocal TV station MTV said the Czechs were on a journalism mission, and said the cameras had been used for filming purposes “hours before the incident.” \nThe Czech Foreign Ministry confirmed the news of their disappearance Saturday night, after the country’s authorities held a crisis meeting to discuss the matter. \nThe Czech Foreign Ministry also withheld the names of the missing nationals in order not to jeopardize the investigation, spokeswoman Michaela Lagronova told reporters. \nCzech authorities announced that they will not delve into any details concerning abduction theories in an effort to secure the lives of the missing people. \nIt remains unclear if the case of the missing tourists was in any way linked to that of Fayad, but kidnappings for the purpose of exchanging prisoners or hostages is not new to Lebanon. \nIn 2013, two Turkish pilots were abducted near the Beirut airport by families of the nine Shiite pilgrims who were abducted by rebels in northern Syria the previous year. The pilots were released two months later after Turkey intervened to secure the release of the pilgrims.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T02:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T02:48:00.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
