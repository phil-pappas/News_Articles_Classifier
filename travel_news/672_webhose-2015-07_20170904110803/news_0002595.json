The figures glow in red and green at pedestrian crosswalks and show both female and male couples. Other cities in Germany, including Berlin and Hamburg, are also seizing on the initiative. Europe has seen a surge in gay rights awareness since the May gay marriage referendum in Ireland. \nIain McFarland, an Orange bandsman, plays his flute during the 11th night bonfire at the New Mossley housing estate in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

The bonfires also mark the beginning of the annual 12th of July Orange parades. \nCity workers walk past Damien Hirst's sculpture 'Charity' opposite the Gherkin building in London, England.
