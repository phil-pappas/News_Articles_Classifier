Local authorities acquiesced on condition the elevator is removed after the visit. \n“We’re sick and tired of this messing around,” a local woman said ahead of the visit. \n“I can see it’s normal that you need to guarantee their security, but they should let us go for a swim.” — Afp-Relaxnews More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T21:02:13.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
