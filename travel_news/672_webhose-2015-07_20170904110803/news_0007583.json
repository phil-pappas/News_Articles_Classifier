As such, Moe Ibrahim, president director of Bintan Lagoon Resort said that the place now needs a ”software” upgrade of its services, as opposed to cosmetic changes. \n\n“Some renovations are needed here and there but what we really need is a software and social upgrade. We need staff to engage more deeply with guests and put them at the centre of everything. At the end of the day, the guests don’t really remember what the hotel room looks like. What they remember is the social interaction that they have with the resort staff,” said Moe. \n\nCredit: Samuel Ng \n\nRegarding impending competition, Moe is “excited” about the developments of two new IRs on Bintan, Lagoi Bay and Treasure Bay. \n\nComparing Bintan to the early developmental years of Macau, Moe said: “Bintan has so many things to offer but there is a lack of market awareness. So the more projects that take place here, the more it would benefit everybody. \n\n“It’s like a food court. If you only have one chicken rice stall, no one really shows up. But if you fill the food court up with other stalls, it starts to get really busy,” he said. \n\nMeanwhile, as part of its new plans, the resort is working together with the Indonesian government and tour providers to put in place itineraries for guests to have options both inside and outside of the resort.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T13:44:28.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
