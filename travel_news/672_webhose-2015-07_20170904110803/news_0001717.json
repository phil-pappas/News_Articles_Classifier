Gaskins, who has won the title twice previously, took part in a cook-off competition against four other local chefs on Thursday 9th July at Northampton College. \nEach chef was challenged to prepare two courses using a selection of products from Awards sponsors Booker, including a shoulder of lamb, as well as key Northamptonshire ingredients of rapeseed oil from Farrington Oils in Hargrave, cider from Saxby’s Cider in Irchester and rhubarb gin from Harrington-based Warner Edwards. Now in its 7th year, the competition is aimed at celebrating all that is great about local produce and drink, recognising excellence within Northamptonshire’s dining venues and rewarding those who work so hard within the culinary sector. Commenting on the awards, Gaskins said: “I'm honoured to have been shortlisted for ‘Chef of the Year' again and have really enjoyed the competition so far. It is always a pleasure taking part in the awards, meeting some great chefs and cooking with some of the finest Northamptonshire produce.” The winner will be announced on Thursday 15th October at the Awards Dinner taking place at Royal & Derngate, Northampton.
