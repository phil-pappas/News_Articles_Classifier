But others are so popular that you need to book your sailing months, if not a year, in advance to secure a spot – snooze and you may need to wait another year for your dream cruise. \nIf you have your heart on a cruise that is listed as sold out, see if you can get on a waitlist (and hope that someone else’s plans change). \nHere are 10 popular summertime cruises you should book in advance. \nEurope river cruises: River ships typically carry fewer than 200 passengers; the small number of passengers and high demand make spots difficult to get. Popular routes such as the Danube and Rhine summer sailings sell out well in advance – you’d be lucky to find a cabin now for the remainder of the summer, and very limited space in the fall. Make plans now for next year. \nBermuda: Royal Caribbean’s five-day cruises out of Bayonne, New Jersey attract Tri-State cruisers looking for a quick summertime getaway. There’s limited availability remaining this summer. Fortunately, the Grandeur of the Seas and super hip Anthem of the Seas (the ship with the robot bartenders, bumper cars and virtual skydiving) will do the route again beginning next spring. \nAlaska via San Francisco: Princess Cruises’ 10-day sailings from San Francisco on the Golden Princess visit Juneau, Skagway, Ketchikan, Victoria (B.C.) and either Glacier Bay National Park or Tracy Arm Fjord. A bonus is you can do a pre- or post-cruise stay in San Francisco. There’s limited availability for the remainder of the season, but you can grab a stateroom now for when the Grand Princess takes over the route next year. \nDisney Alaska: Disney Cruise Line has helped make Alaska a popular family destination. Kids love adventures such as gold panning, with appearances by Disney characters. But if you want to get onboard the line’s Alaska ship, Disney Wonder, you should start planning next year’s summer vacation – there’s limited availability for the rest of this year. The sailings are round-trip from Vancouver. \nSouthern Caribbean: Repeat Carnival Cruise Line fans like when the line breaks from the tried and true. This summer, that’s the case with the Carnival Liberty sailing round-trip itineraries from Barbados to St. Lucia, St. Kitts, St. Maarten, San Juan and St. Thomas. There’s limited availability through October. Carnival Fascination will do the same route next year. \n180-day world cruise: Oceania Cruises’ latest sold out 180-day world cruise on the Insignia embarks this month. There’s a waitlist for the next 180-day sailing, which embarks Miami in January 2016. No word yet on whether there will be similar extended itineraries in summer 2016 and 2017, but stay tuned – if they get announced you’ll want to jump on that ASAP. \nLuxury eastern Med: Seven-day cruises in Turkey and the Greek Isles on the 450-passenger Seabourn Odyssey have proven popular with the swank set. There’s limited availability for the rest of this year on the sailings – which embark from Istanbul, Athens (Piraeus) and Venice, and call at Katakalon (for Olympia) and such lesser-known ports as Sali, Croatia and Nydri, Greece. You’ll want to make plans now for summer 2016. \nViking Ocean Cruises: Fans of Viking River Cruises couldn’t wait to check out the line’s new upscale ocean product (with shore excursions among perks included in the cruise fare). Sailings on the 930-passenger Viking Star in the Baltics and Mediterranean are sold out through mid-November, and some sailings beyond that. Sister ship Viking Sea debuts in April with sold out itineraries too. Time to make reservations for 2016 and beyond. \nOne-week Mediterranean: Celebrity Cruises’“modern luxury” ship Celebrity Equinox, with its half-acre of real grass lawn up on top, is a hit in the Mediterranean, especially with its seven-day cruises from Barcelona, Athens, Istanbul and Rome. Forget about getting on in July, but you may find some space in August – or start planning for next summer. \nLuxury Baltics: The big attraction of the seven-day Seabourn Quest itineraries between Stockholm and Copenhagen is that you get two nights/three days to explore St. Petersburg, Russia. The sailings also visit Tallinn, Estonia and Helsinki. This year’s cruises are sold out, plan now for next July.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T21:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T03:48:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
