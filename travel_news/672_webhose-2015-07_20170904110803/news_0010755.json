(AP) — New York state’s private colleges and universities will soon have a new, affirmative sexual consent policy to combat campus sexual violence.\nGov. Andrew Cuomo plans to sign the measure into law Tuesday at New York University.\nThe bill includes a “yes means yes” definition of consent requiring a clear, affirmative agreement between partners. It also creates a victim’s bill of rights and boosts training for law enforcement, faculty and students.\nThe state’s public schools adopted the policy last year.\n Cuomo had made the policy a priority in the recently concluded legislative session, teaming up with pop artist Lady Gaga to write a supportive op-ed in Billboard Magazine.\nLast year, California became the first state to adopt a “yes means yes” law for all schools that receive state money for financial aid.\nThe Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T19:14:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
