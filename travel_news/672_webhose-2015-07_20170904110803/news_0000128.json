The new eatery in Pool, near Redruth, allows drivers to place their order for the traditional Cornish treat at one window, then drive to pick up their goods at another. It is part of a new restaurant from Portreath Bakery, which runs two other bakeries in the county. • A taste for tradition: the history of the Cornish pasty Owner Marion Symonds told the Western Daily Press : \"The drive-through is important - because I don't like queuing. \"I was on my own with my children for a while and I found that I'd have to get out of the car, one of them would have dozed off and I couldn't get a loaf of bread. • The secret of the 88-year-old World Pasty Champion \"Sometimes I'd think - I need milk and you can't just leave your kids in the car - so, from our drive-through you'll be able to get a loaf of bread - and of course a pasty. \"The plans have been in the pipeline for 18 months and I am buzzing.\" Here at Telegraph Food, we reckon if the bakery throws in a scone and some clotted cream when you order, our lives will be complete.
