Although an independent commission backed the expansion of Heathrow this month, saying increased airport capacity would provide an economic boon, environmental groups contend that it would aggravate climate change and create unacceptable noise pollution. Heathrow said on its website that the protesters had caused disruptions. “This morning, a group of people staged a protest on the northern runway,” the airport said in a statement. “These individuals have since been removed by police.” “Both runways were operational throughout, although there have been some delays and a few cancellations — we are sorry to those passengers who experienced disruption this morning,” it said. The statement advised passengers to check the status of their flights before traveling to the airport. Images posted on Twitter showed the protesters chained to one another, some with smiles on their faces. The Airports Commission, led by an economist, Howard Davies, said in its report that the runway expansion at Heathrow would add $230 billion in economic growth over 60 years and 70,000 jobs by 2050. In addition to cutting costs for consumers and providing better connections around the world, the commission said, the new runway would allow Heathrow to double its passenger capacity by 2050. Mayor Boris Johnson of London has opposed the commission’s recommendation, even as a fellow Conservative, the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, has reportedly supported an expansion of Heathrow, along with Sajid Javid, the business secretary.
