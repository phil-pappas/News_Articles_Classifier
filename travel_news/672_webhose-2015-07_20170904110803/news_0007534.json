From the top of a steep hillside covered in lemon trees and grapevines, the village of Manarola tumbles out below, like a handful of pink, orange and yellow blocks that have been shaken, then poured from a toy bag. Manarola is one of five hamlets of Cinque Terre (“Five Lands” in Italian), villages strewn a few miles apart along the Mediterranean coast between Pisa and Genoa in northern Italy. Each comes with its own personality, and the best way to see them is to pick one as a home base (we chose Manarola because it’s smaller and quieter than the others), then spend a few days hiking between them, pausing to sip wine, eat grilled octopus and swim in the sea. We left our cliffside apartment in the morning, hiked up through steep terraces covered with vineyards, paused to admire a chapel and sip lemonade in the pint-size village of Volastra, then descended into Corniglia, where we revived ourselves with gelato before striking out for the next town up the coast, Vernazza. It’s easy to imagine the days when pirates sailed up and down this coast. The people who once lived here used stone watchtowers to defend their homes, which are perched on cliffs and tucked into nooks and crannies molded by Mother Nature. It’s long been a wine-producing region, and farmers planted crops on terraces they cut into the hills. But things have changed. In 1951, about 3,500 acres of land here were cultivated. After Cinque Terre was discovered by tourists in the 1970s, the economy began a gradual shift from agriculture to tourism. Today only about 275 acres are cultivated. The crop abandonment has caused soil erosion and land degradation, and the trails periodically wash out. We had to adjust our hiking plans because of landslides. The flat, easy pathway between Manarola, the second village if you’re counting from the south, and the next village up the coast to the north, Corniglia, is covered with gravel. So is the easy, flat walkway known as Via dell’Amore, which connects Manarola with Riomaggiore to the south. No matter. We took the high road to Corniglia instead, hiking the spine of the hillside to get up and over, pausing to admire a chapel in an even tinier hamlet called Volastra. We were in no hurry. Here in Cinque Terre, it’s all about walking, relaxing and the views. (It’s also about scaling thousands of steps and eating gelato.) Make sure you have proper footwear before you strike out. Some of the trails (especially the one from Vernazza to Monterosso) are extremely narrow and crowded. In sections, passage is only single file, so if you meet someone coming the other direction, you have to wait your turn. And the steps! The Vernazza to Monterosso section of the trail has as many as a skyscraper; hike it northbound or your quads will stage a protest. And only attempt the walk if you’re reasonably fit. Happily, Vernazzo and Monterosso offer fine swimming, so once you’ve worked up a sweat hiking you can cool off in the sea. We braved the tiny gravel beach in Vernazza in our hiking duds, and it was totally worth it. While you’re there, look for bits of painted tile on the beach. They’re a reminder of the devastating floods and mudslides that occurred here in 2011. Monterosso’s beaches are more formal; you can rent a beach umbrella for 20 euros and swim in water protected by a rocky sandbar. Or hike a little farther up and over the spit of land that essentially divides the town to find a more casual beach. Either way, spend some time exploring the market, the shops and the churches in this, the most bustling of Cinque Terre’s five villages. If you walk from one town to the next and don’t feel like hiking back, you can catch the train for a few euros. Even better, hop on a ferry boat for a different perspective of Cinque Terre. It’s an image you won’t soon forget. Cinque Terre Hiking there Popular guidebook writer Rick Steves calls the Cinque Terre “the lowbrow, under-appreciated alternative to the French Riviera,” adding that “There’s not a museum in sight, just sun, sea, sand (well, pebbles), wine, swimming, hiking and pure, unadulterated Italy.” Since the area is prone to landslides, it’s always wise to check if the hiking paths are open before heading out. You must purchase a pass if you hike the trail No. 2 (blue), the one closest to the water, known as the Coastal Track. No pass is required for the other trails. Get the card from Parco Nazionale Delle Cinque Terre before you head out. You can buy it at booths along the trail or at park headquarters in Manarola. The area is a UNESCO World Heritage site. It’s also possible to purchase a hiking and train pass in one if you wish to catch a train to the next town. Trains are frequent but check local time tables especially on Sunday and public holidays, as you could be waiting up to an hour for the right train. For more information about Cinque Terre, National Park go to www.parconazionale5terre.it . Staying there We paid about 90 euros (about $100) to stay in a one-bedroom apartment called da Paulin (which also offers hotel rooms in a separate building). For more information go to www.dapaulin.it or email prenotazioni@dapaulin.it . Stay at least two nights. High season runs from mid-June to mid-September. Day trippers flood the towns, but by dusk most of the crowds are gone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T22:48:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
