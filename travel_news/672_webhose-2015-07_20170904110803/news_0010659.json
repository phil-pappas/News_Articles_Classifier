Passengers can also travel to Lufupa and Chunga airstrips in the park by arrangement. \n“Zambia is a beautiful country and our wildlife is worth seeing at least once in one’s lifetime. The flight to the park will save customers travelling time which they can spend enjoying the national park,” said Proflight Director of Government and Industry Affairs Captain Philip Lemba. \n“With this offer, we hope to see more people visiting the park and be more inspired to see the rest of Zambia, which is equally breath-taking,” he added. \nFlight P0654 flies from Lusaka to Busanga at 11:15hrs, arriving at 12:50 on Mondays Wednesdays and Saturdays, and returns from Busanga at 13:05, arriving back in Lusaka at 14:40 on the same days to enable smooth connections with Emirates and South African Airline flights. \nKafue National Park has a reputation as a tranquil environment with just the right touch of adventure and is home to 55 species of animals, including rare birds, big cats and elephants. \nExtending to 22,400 square kilometres, the park boasts lodges and camps to cater for all budgets. \nAlong with Kafue, Proflight Zambia expected to add other routes to its network in the coming months, including Kitwe Southdowns on July 13.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T13:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T21:37:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
