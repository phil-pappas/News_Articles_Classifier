This special project is in support of the Hong Kong Education Bureau’s life planning and career guidance for students initiative and is also further co-organized by the Hong Kong and Macau Taiwanese Charity Fund Limited and Maywood Travel Ltd. \n“Good corporate citizenship has always been an integral part of Genting Hong Kong’s values and we hold education and youth development close to our heart,” said Mona Lai, General Counsel and SVP, Legal & Corporate Communications of Genting Hong Kong. “While tourism in the city has long been an essential part of the local economy, the cruise industry is still a relatively new and under-represented sector but with enormous growth potential. Our goal is to provide an opportunity for the next generation of professionals to experience the business first hand through a tailor made program of useful information sessions and behind the scenes tours to give students a glimpse into a possible career in the cruise industry.” \nDuring the press conference, renowned Taiwanese singer and actor, Richie Jen, who most recently made his directorial debut with the film “All you Need is Love”, was on hand for a special appearance to share recollections of his childhood dream of breaking into the entertainment industry and to encourage the students to pursue their goals and to further develop their strengths. 20 students from 20 different secondary schools were also chosen to participate in an informative question and answer session on stage with Mr. Jen during the event. \nThe second annual Dream Voyage to Taiwan educational cruise brings together 60 deserving students from across Hong Kong who showed the best improvement in their academic results or in their comportment this year to experience a special journey that combines the excitement of travel with new opportunities for learning. \nWhile at sea, the students will be able to listen to influential speakers including Mr. Francis Li Kwok Kay, former Assistant Director of Community Relations, ICAC, talk about career planning, skills development and the sharing of knowledge. Additionally, Star Cruises’ Hotel Manager, Michael Seet, will lead a discussion about cruise operations and career opportunities and development on board Star Cruises ships, highlighted with a tour including backstage access to the Lido theatre and the ship’s galley. \nAlso on board will be Hong Kong based lead singer of the band Sugar Club and TV and film actress, Kandy Wong, who will act as mentor to the students during the voyage. \nOn shore in Kaohsiung, the students will be able to meet with their Taiwanese school peers from the National Kaohsiung University of Hospitality and Tourism and commune with nature during a fun fruit picking excursion. In Taichung, they will take part in an enlightening tour of the National Museum of Natural Science and test their culinary skills with a DIY bubble tea making session hosted by Chun Shui Tang, a famous teahouse in Taiwan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T21:44:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
