Delta, the top carrier at LaGuardia, appeared to be suffering the worst of the disruptions.\n\"Due to current power outages affecting airlines operating in Terminal C, Parking Lots 4 and 5, flight disruptions may result,\" LaGaurdia Airport said in an alert posted to its website . \"Please check with your airline to determine if your flight is affected.\"\nFLIGHT TRACKER: Is your flight on time?\nUSA TODAY\nWorld's strangest-looking airplane? A closer look at the Airbus 'Beluga'\nUSA TODAY\nVietnam Airlines shows off first 787 at D.C.'s National Airport\nThe snafu was delaying some inbound flights by up to 3 hours as of 9 a.m. ET, according to the Federal Aviation Administration . Delays to inbound flights are also likely to affect outbound flights.\nCancellations also were a problem. About 155 flights -- more than 10% of the airport's daily schedule -- had been axed as of 9:25 a.m. ET, according to flight-tracking firm FlightAware .\nDelta Air Lines and American Airlines' merger partner US Airways operate out of Terminal C . That includes US Airways' shuttle flights and Delta's shuttle service to Boston. Delta and its Delta Connection affiliates have by far the biggest presence at LaGuardia.\nFlightAware showed that Delta had canceled about 60 flights nationwide and that Shuttle Express -- which operates some flights under the Delta brand -- had canceled 41. It was not immediately clear how many of those were tied to LaGuardia.\nAmerican Airlines spokeswoman Michelle Mohr tells Today in the Sky that there's been minimal impact to US Airways' operation at LaGuardia. She says a small number of Shuttle flights departed a few minutes behind schedule, but that otherwise the carrier has had \"no cancellations or notable impact.\"\nToday in the Sky also has reached out to Delta for an update on its operation there.\nNBC News reporter Stephanie Gosk appeared to be among the affected travelers. She tweeted an image of a departure screen showing many canceled flights, adding: \"Nuttiness at La Guardia this morning. Electricity out in terminal C. Delta is canceling a bunch of flights.\"\nNuttiness at La Guardia this morning. Electricity out in terminal C.
