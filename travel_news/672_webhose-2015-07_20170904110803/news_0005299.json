Soggy tomato sandwiches (bliss), apple juice and a flask of milky coffee remind me of the picnics that my grandparents treated me to when I was a kid, and I’m still happy with that for a hastily arranged family outing. But over the years I’ve packed many kinds of portable feasts. There have been labour-intensive picnics (the sort you might take to Glyndebourne, minus the candelabra), those based entirely on French charcuterie (for Eurostar trips) and kid-friendly ones (for school sports days). All of them have one thing in common: they’re made up of dishes I’ve prepared and treats I’ve bought. Picnic happiness, for me, begins with the shopping. I tend to be quite frugal but a picnic means indulgence. Cured ham – Parma or serrano – is always on the list, accompanied by slices of mango (there is no need to stick to melon) or ripe peaches. There has to be cheese as well but I always go for something I wouldn’t usually buy. I never have cheddar on a summer picnic (it seems too workaday) but a goat cheese such as Moody’s Rosary Ash or a creamy Chaource. A pot of burrata – you can drain it at the picnic – that you can tear apart, drizzle with good extra virgin olive oil and eat with roast tomatoes is also great. Picnic happiness, for me, begins with the shopping Hardboiled eggs are a must. It isn’t a picnic without eggs. There is just something about peeling them in the open air. But you can buy quail’s eggs instead of hen’s if you want them to be special. To accompany these get some black olive tapenade – the rich inky taste of olives is great against egg yolks – or make a mayonnaise and add plenty of chopped tarragon (or use a good bought mayo mixed with lemon juice and a couple of tablespoons of fromage frais). Alternatively, go Scandinavian and serve hard-boiled eggs with dill sour cream, a pot of salmon roe and hot smoked salmon fillets. Get rye bread if you’re going in that direction (and whatever bread you do get, buy a good one. It is definitely not the meal for anything pre-sliced). Also put radishes on the list, preferably torpedo-shaped French breakfast radishes. They do not just look good – you need their cool peppery crunchiness with the richness of cheeses, eggs and hams. While it is not essential that you have a central dish (you can just pick at all the things I’ve mentioned), it does convey a sense of abundance and generosity. I might do a smoked trout and spinach tart or a big salad of poached chicken breasts, watercress and cherries with a creamy tarragon vinaigrette. Leaf salads cannot be dressed till you are at the picnic – just pack your vinaigrette in a jam jar – though grain salads (made from spelt, freekeh or brown and wild rice) or little waxy potatoes actually benefit from soaking in vinaigrette on the way there. I suppose my advice is a bit contradictory. Don’t fret, but also be caring and generous Sweet things? Please, no flapjacks. I know that they are transportable but it’s summer! Fruit tarts aren’t great – they get soggy – but anything cakey (a lemon drizzle cake with elderflower added to the syrup, for example) transports well and can be eaten with gooseberry compote or blackberries. Brownies (buy good ones), a pot of crème fraîche and a couple of punnets of raspberries seems an absolutely perfect combination to me. And if you want to be really chic, let everyone slice their own peach into a glass and add chilled moscato. I suppose my picnic advice is a bit contradictory: I’d say don’t fret, but also be caring and generous. Whatever your age, a picnic – as it is eaten away from home and without the usual rules – is an adventure. And that’s worth celebrating.
