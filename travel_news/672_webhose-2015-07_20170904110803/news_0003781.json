But one Canadian hotel knew just how to cheer this traveller up. \nAnnelies Vredeveldt, a psychologist from the Netherlands, was forced to leave Canada without her faithful stuffed dog Boris, when he mysteriously went missing from her hotel room. \n\"I turned the room upside down, and after I couldn't find him I called housekeeping. They didn't know what had happened either,\" she told The Huffington Post. \nVredeveldt returned home alone but two weeks later she received a package from The Fairmont Empress Hotel, where she had stayed. It turned out Boris was accidentally picked up with the laundry at the hotel. \nInside the package was a well-travelled Boris, a note from the hotel and a handful of photographs. \n\"I wanted to once again apologize for the delay in finding your stuffed dog\", the note read. \n\"We ensured that he enjoyed Canada Day here at the Empress in Victoria and all the staff enjoyed having him on our country's special day\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T03:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T10:25:05.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
