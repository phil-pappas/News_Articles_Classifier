An official with American Honey Bee Protection agency on Sunday safely rappelled from the 14-story Holiday Inn Austin at Lady Bird Lake. Rick Alanzo then used smoke to calm the bees. Agency CEO Walter Schumacher was on the roof making sure the high-rise effort worked. Officials originally planned to move the bees to a rural area near Austin, but instead put boxes on the hotel roof to use the hive and make an apiary. Holiday Inn authorities, who did not want the insects killed, suggested putting the bees on the roof to produce honey to be served to hotel guests.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T17:21:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
