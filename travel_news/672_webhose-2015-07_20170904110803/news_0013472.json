After the dramatic drop in FY 2014, the Philippines is showing significant improvement with 19,447 pax in the first half of the fiscal year October 2014 to March 2015, said TCEB acting director Nooch Homrossukhon. \n\nNooch explained that many companies that held back their MICE events during Thailand’s period of instability will likely return over the rest of the year, crediting social media and word of mouth for the return of MICE traffic. \n\nTCEB unveiled its Thailand - Connect The World scheme offering financial subsidies and spiced up privileges and discounts, among others, for MICE groups at its roadshow in the Philippines earlier this month. \n\nTo ease safety concerns, TCEB has also spoken to meeting organisers to reassure them that the CVB has contingency plans in place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T17:18:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
