The VIP service can be booked with all cabin categories. \nJo Rzymowska, managing director, Celebrity Cruises, told TTG: “If we get the feedback we think we will, we will certainly look to open up the service on other routes and other ships using the Stansted Terminal.” \nMichael English, head of business development, advised agents to sell it as a value proposition: “I believe one of the simplest selling opportunities is the price. Flying from a private terminal in Stansted on June 18 currently costs £60 more than flying Heathrow, and [that’s before you take into account] the free parking at Stansted with the cost of parking at Heathrow.” \nDondra Ritzenthaler, senior vice president of sales at Celebrity Cruises, encouraged early booking to take advantage of the best prices: “”We’ve deliberately started at an attractive price point,” she said. “But this is scaleable and we want this to become the norm for the Celebrity airport experience.” \nJet Set Sail is available for a total of 11 seven and 11-night Mediterranean cruises on Celebrity Equinox starting on May 31. \nYesterday the line hosted travel partners at Stansted Airport’s Private Jet Terminal so they could see the facilities and 130-seat Boeing 737 for themselves. \nJason Peters, director, Creative Cruises, was the first agent to make a booking when Jet Set Sail went on sale on July 4. He said the product added another dimension to the Celebrity experience: “It’s been a long-time coming, and this matches the brand totally. It’s difficult for cruise lines to differentiate themselves in a crowded market, and this solves the problem of getting to the ship, while providing an experience too.” \nHe said his clients in the north of England were prepared to travel for a service like this: “it’s a good indication of the aviation market generally. People want to experience something different. And it’s great for nervous flyers who get to avoid the stress of the airports.” \nLisa Lightly, manager, East of England Co-op in Tiptree thought the concept was “fantastic.” “The whole concept of turning up an hour before the plane leaves, and the ease of it… it’s calm and sophisticated. For us Stansted is a big seller, and to be treated in such a special way in your preferred gateway is amazing.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T14:56:25.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
