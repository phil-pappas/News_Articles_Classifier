Taking home the awards for Best Cookbook in China 2014 and Top 3 Cookbooks in the World 2014 in the French category, these accolades add to Chef Vienne’s award portfolio to now accompany the Michelin Star he earned while head chef of Café Moderne in Paris.\nShanghai Flair is the third cookbook penned by Chef Vienne and is published in both English and Chinese. Prior to his arrival in Mauritius, Chef Vienne spent a period of five years working in various locations across China, allowing him to study and perfect the fine art of Chinese cuisine. In this latest publication, Chef Vienne has been able to showcase his broad Chinese culinary knowledge while carefully combining French techniques to enhance flavours and create new opportunities to discover traditional dishes.\nCommenting on Shanghai Flair, Chef Vienne says: “Along with my recipes, I wanted to share stories that have touched my heart when I was living in Shanghai. Many see China as a vast land of strong economic growth and mammoth urban expansion, but I see her as a homeland of great cultures and inspiration. I was also keen to bring attention to the true Chinese culture in different cities, of which the first stop is Shanghai, because Shanghai opened the first chapter of my stories in Asia. After all, it is the city that made me fall in love with China.”\n“Each recipe in this book has a story of its own, as for me, food without a story merely fills the stomach without nourishing the soul. It is therefore a great honour to have been recognised by the Gourmand Awards and I hope people both within and outside of China will now discover and enjoy my recipes.”\nSource:-Four Seasons\nRelated Posts 40% reduction in room rates in Grand Hyatt Taipei in July and August Express your love this Valentine’s Day at Calabash Cove Resort & Spa Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium Melia Hotels International becomes a partner of the World Community Grid, initiative sponsored by IBM Lisa Lewis Joins Associated Luxury Hotels As National Sales Manager In The U.S. West Region", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T10:51:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
