On page 10 we find one about the use of meat substitutes. Although “meat-eating is a habit which many English people may not find it easy to break away from” and “meat is far too nutritious a food to be dropped out of the national diet,” if people were “clearly told what other and equally nourishing foodstuffs are best suited to take their place” then perhaps it would help prevent a meat famine. However “people do not read … text-books” in which such information can be found, so Eustace Miles provides a helpful article for readers. However all is not totally what it might seem there. Whilst Miles, a former amateur world rackets and real tennis champion, gives what appears to be disinterested information, it is anything but. Miles was the proprietor of a health food shop and vegetarian restaurant, and was a crusader against a meat-rich diet, so he is clearly seizing the opportunity to utilise the necessities of wartime to promote his beliefs. Whilst he had a reputation by 1915, would all readers of the Telegraph been quite aware about the back story to this article?
