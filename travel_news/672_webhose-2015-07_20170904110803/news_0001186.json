Channel Seven broadcast the race nationally, showcasing the Great Ocean Road region to viewers from all over Australia and a further 106 countries.\nIn a ringing endorsement, the event has been awarded elevated sanctioning from the Union Cycliste International. In principle approval for 1.HC status means the event is only one level below a grand tour, and will help lure the world’s top cyclists to Geelong.\nThe Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race is already capturing the attention of the international cycling fraternity. Last year, eight of the world’s top UCI WorldTeam outfits competed, and five have already flagged their return in 2016 – including Orica GreenEDGE.\nRelated Posts Chelsea Football Club Hosts Leaders Sport Summit 2013, the world’s most Prestigious Sport Business Summit MIA Director, National Counterparts Travel To Washington, D.c.
