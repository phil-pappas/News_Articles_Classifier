On a week-long yoga retreat, I followed a strict ayurvedic diet, practised meditation, took barefoot walks along Alpine streams and had two days of silence to still the mind. It completely changed my outlook. I felt more invigorated and uplifted than after any other holiday I can recall. Hidden Dragon ( hidden-dragon.com ) offers week-long breaks from £3,250 per person, including board and activities. Gabriella Le Breton Cultural Istanbul A few simple facts about the wondrous, soaring, eye-stretching grandeur of the great dome and half domes of Hagia Sophia, and their vast, hushed interior, tell the story of this extraordinary building graphically. Commissioned by Emperor Justinian I in 532, it was completed in its current form in 562. Surviving earthquake, fire, pillaging crusaders and the Ottoman occupation, it remained for almost 1,000 years the largest enclosed space ever built. Put simply, it is one of the greatest architectural achievements of world history. A visit there is profoundly moving . Read Telegraph Travel’s expert guide to Istanbul at telegraph.co.uk/istanbul . Telegraph Tours is also offering a unique 14-night luxury Cunard cruise – in the company of Telegraph experts – which includes stays in Istanbul. See telegraph.co.uk/cunardcruise or call 0333 005 9159. Nick Trend Istanbul is a moving city to visit Photo: AP/FOTOLIA Star-gazing in Chile I first looked through a powerful optical telescope on a stargazers’ tour around Chile, at the country’s Mamalluca Observatory in the Elqui Valley. There was Saturn and its rings, and the magical swirls of the Orion Nebula, one of the Hubble telescope’s favourite subjects. At Alma, the world’s largest astronomical project, high in the Atacama Desert, I met scientists searching the edges of our known universe . This was travel at its most mind-expanding. Audley Travel (01993 838650; audley.co.uk ) can organise a nine-day trip to Chile, including visits to the Elqui Valley and San Pedro de Atacama, from £3,615 per person. Michelle Jana Chan Star-gazing in Chile is travel at its most mind-expanding Australian masterclass If only I’d listened to the bloke in tweed, I thought, as we zipped around the Kimberley on Zodiac inflatables, part of a cruise around this magnificent section of the Australian coastline. As I tried (and failed) to recall any detail from school geography lessons other than my teacher’s jacket and his mop of curly hair, it was all I could do to keep up. Here was tectonic chaos laid bare: great lava-like cliffs of rock, towering rock escarpments and a honeycomb strata with holes so big you could put your fists in. It was a thousand geography lessons rolled into one. Mundy Adventures (020 7399 7630; mundyadventures.co.uk ) offers a 13-night Kimberley expedition from Darwin to Broome on the National Geographic Orion from £11,995 per person. Teresa Machan Language learning in Valencia “Total immersion” is a phrase you hear often in relation to language learning. At the start of my week with a family in Valencia, I was immersing myself in cold showers because the instructions about the bathroom boiler were entirely in Spanish and I was terrified of burning down the apartment. Soon, however, one-to-one lessons and my hosts’ encouragement were making a big difference. I learnt the truth of the phrase “Mi casa es su casa’’ (make yourself at home). On the flight home, I found myself burbling away to a couple of Spanish pensioners instead of burying my nose in a book. CESA Languages Abroad (01209 211800; cesalanguages.com ) offers a week’s half-board stay with a family in Valencia and five one-to-one lessons from £362. Flights extra. Michael Kerr Valencia Photo: AP/FOTOLIA Hebrides in winter It would be freezing going to the Outer Hebrides in January, people said. Ferries get delayed, they added. We went anyway and revelled in the space, air, people and slow pace of island life. Over a week, we stayed in self-catering cottages with fireplaces and big baths in which to wallow and read books. By day, we walked along remote coastlines, then, after a dram in a local pub, collapsed by the fire, our lungs filled with brisk sea air and our noses full of the smell of salt and seaweed . It was just what our city-addled brains needed . For recommendations on the best cottages to stay in the Outer Hebrides, see telegraph.co.uk/hebridescottages . Lisa Grainger Sewing in Sussex Sewing? The mind? I know, weird. But this lovely, calm space in a converted 18th-century cowshed on the edge of the Goodwood Estate in West Sussex is a rare chance to use your hands, focus on one thing, chat (or not chat) and walk away with a garment at the end. If, like me, you hated school sewing, this is where you make peace with bias binding and tailor tacks. Learning this skill was a tranquil, sociable experience – and no one was more surprised than me. The Textile Space (01243 811300; thetextilespace.co.uk ) offers a summer sewing school for £175 (course only). Sophie Campbell Body E-bikes in Austria Like many cyclists, I was sceptical of the battery-assisted e-bike, but for our family – some faster than others – its power assistance was transformative. \"After climbing the Austrian Alps in a singalong, recrimination-free peloton, we declared the e-bike one of our favourite things\" Adam Ruck Climbing the Austrian Alps in a singalong, recrimination-free peloton, at the top we declared the e-bike one of our favourite things. Thirty to 40 miles a day through this sublime scenery is a well-judged allowance – manageable yet satisfying – and overnight stays in castle-hotels and a former palace brewery bring an added feelgood factor. The Carter Company (01296 631671; the-carter-company.com ) offers six nights in the Alps from £880 per person based on two sharing; plus £95 for an e-bike. Flights extra. Adam Ruck Trekking in India High adventure in low-key style is a good summary of the trekking that Village Ways, an ecotourism company, runs in the foothills of the Himalayas in Uttarakhand, India. My wife and I were guided by villagers, and stayed in their guesthouses. We looked down from temples on circling vultures, with the nearest road an hour’s walk away . From a tented camp at 10,068ft, we watched the morning sun peel away a scarf of mist to reveal peak after snow-capped peak. As a backdrop to morning chai, it couldn’t be bettered. Village Ways (01223 750049; villageways.com ) organises a 12-night trip to the Saryu and Pindar Valleys from £887 per person for a party of four to six . Flights extra. Michael Kerr Village Ways, an ecotourism company, runs in the foothills of the Himalayas Caribbean workout If you stay at an all-inclusive, there is always the temptation to indulge. And I was an absolute glutton at the BodyHoliday, although in the most virtuous of ways. This Caribbean resort, tucked in a bay in northern St Lucia, offers a daily smorgasbord of sports, including morning beach boot camps with bona fide Olympians (rower Katherine Grainger during my week) . Spa treatments repair you for the next day’s physical feast. British Airways Holidays (001 758 457 7800; ba.com/thebodyholiday ) offers a seven-night stay, from £2,449 per person including accommodation, board, spa treatment and most activities. Sarah Baxter Juicing in Portugal It’s no exaggeration to say that the week I recently spent at the Jason Vale Juicy Oasis in Portugal changed my life. After living on juice, bouncing on mini-trampolines, spinning and doing yoga at dawn, I came back fizzing with energy – friends even said I looked different . I haven’t stuck with the juices, but the experience has reset my attitude to exercise. Juicy Oasis (01234 480280; juicyoasis.com ) offers week-long stays from £1,195, including all juices and classes. Flights extra. Olivia Walmsley Yoga in Brazil Ibitipoca is an extraordinary place: uplifting, calming, invigorating and surprising. Nothing jars in the beautifully restored 1715 lake-side farmhouse, set in a lush valley four hours from Rio. \"The Ibitipoca estate, with its wildlife and sculptures, is yours to discover on horseback, foot, or electric bike\" Fiona Duncan A graceful mother and daughter conduct yoga as well as a wide range of massages in an airy spa, and there is also a wood-fired sauna and hot tub. The setting for dinner is often a surprise – by firelight beside a waterfall, perhaps – and the estate, with its wildlife and sculptures, is yours to discover on horseback, foot, or electric bike. Reserva do Ibitipoca (0055 32 2101 5103; reservadoibitipoca.com.br ) has a three-night stay from £495 per person, full board. Tailor-made packages from Steppes Travel (0845 0756 079; steppestravel.co.uk ). Fiona Duncan South West walks Hobbling into Boscastle’s Cobweb Inn after 17 testing miles on my first day on the South West Coast Path, it was as much as I could do to lift my pint of Doom Bar. The 203-mile Bude-Falmouth section of England’s longest National Trail truly was a baptism of fire: the relentless climbs set my calves ablaze. Yet a fortnight tracing the dramatic Cornish coast around Land’s End and the Lizard sent both fitness and spirits soaring. On long stretches, people are scarce, unlike wildflowers, seabirds, seals and basking sharks . I finished happier and healthier. Magical isn’t overstating it. Macs Adventure (0141 530 8751; macsadventure.com ) offers supported self-guided packages on the path from £320. Or visit southwestcoastpath.com . Paul Bloomfield Exotic wellness in Bali Shambhala Estate was a pioneer of the wellness retreat in Bali. At this resort, you can immerse yourself in the exotic, enjoying daily yoga, Pilates, aqua therapy and fitness classes – or simply walk or cycle amid its 22 acres of tropical gardens. There are also indulgent spa treatments, riverside pools to lounge by and healthy cuisine to enjoy. I added private classes in qigong, an ancient Chinese practice blending martial arts and meditation, to kick-start a healthier way of living. I’m still reaping the rewards. Healing Holidays ( healingholidays.co.uk ) offers breaks from £3,199 per person per week, including international flights and transfers; full board and treatments. Gabriella Le Breton Shambhala Estate, Bali Soul Northern lights cruise Some say the northern lights made them feel more spiritual; I simply found the aurora borealis utterly mesmerising. As our ship rounded the top of Norway, the crew announced there was activity ahead. Cue a rush to jostle for position on the freezing decks. The sense of anticipation was tangible as what looked like a slow-burning firework hovered on the horizon. Suddenly a great patch of the deep blackness to the left took on a soft green glow and soon half the sky was alive with shifting shapes. Dinner had never seemed so unimportant. Hurtigruten (020 3468 4079; hurtigruten.co.uk ) has a five or six-day Arctic Highlights voyage from £799, including flights. John Wilmott The aurora borealis: utterly mesmerising Temple stay in Japan On a mist-shrouded mountaintop covered in ancient forest, lodgings at the sacred retreat of Koyasan have temples attached and are run by monks. I crawled out of bed at 6am for morning meditation and sat amid flickering candles and incense smoke, lulled back into semi-slumber by the chanting and gongs. Staff served me breakfast on my tatami mat – meticulously presented, tiny pots of tofu. Nearby, in a tall cedar wood is Torodo Hall, lit by hundreds of lanterns and containing the mausoleum of Kobo Daishi, the monk Kukai who introduced Shingon Buddhism to Japan in the ninth century. It has an unforgettable setting – and its serenity lingers long after a visit. Audley Travel (01993 838 210; audleytravel.com ) has an 11-night “Ultimate Japan” trip that includes a night in Mount Koya, from £2,625 per person in August. Natalie Paris Desert lodge in Jordan On the edge of the Dana Biosphere Reserve in central Jordan, Feynan Ecolodge is firmly set within the community of Bedouin who have inhabited this land with their animals for centuries. A stay here might mean walking through gorges and exploring abandoned copper mines with a local guide, lying on the roof watching a sky of stars, or simply enjoying the silence . It has genuine eco-credentials : solar panels provide electricity and traditional Yemeni architecture keeps the building cool. Blissfully, Wi-Fi access is limited to a couple of hours a day. There are few places in the world I would rather be. Doubles from £139 . For a full review, visit telegraph.co.uk/feynan . Lizzie Porter Feynan Ecolodge Frozen continent It can be hard to find space and peace and silence in the hurly-burly of the 21st century. But there is one corner of the globe that offers little else – Antarctica. \"A trip to Antarctica is humbling, astonishing, soul-soothing – and a lot more fun than therapy\" Joanna Symons This frozen continent at the end of the Earth has never been permanently occupied by man. Accessible only from November to March, it has no towns, no villages, no habitation bar the odd research station or expedition hut; just grand, icy, unpredictable wilderness. Even aboard an expedition ship, the solitude and the emptiness will envelop you and bring you down to scale. A trip here is humbling, astonishing, soul-soothing – and a lot more fun than therapy. For a full guide to visiting the Antarctic, see telegraph.co.uk/antarctic . Joanna Symons Antarctica: just grand, icy, unpredictable wilderness Photo: GETTY Isle of Wight monastery stay Creature comforts at Quarr Abbey, a Benedictine monastery on the Isle of Wight, might be far and few between, but as one of the few remaining monks at the abbey put it, you go for “a calm space in a world of clutter and noise”. After four days of putting away my mobile phone and avoiding the internet (neither is obligatory), walking in the grounds, reading (the Bible – not obligatory either), attending the occasional service of Gregorian chanting and enjoying the sound of silence (the monks rarely speak), I felt recharged, rebalanced and strangely relaxed. Quarr Abbey, Ryde (01983 882420; quarrabbey.co.uk ) has 10 rooms with 11 beds. No charge, donations welcome. Simon Horsford Epic Australian landscapes My first sight of the Flinders Ranges was from the saddle of a dusty mountain bike. I had just cycled 186 miles from the tiny settlement of Burra across the immensity of South Australia. The Flinders Ranges, a series of ancient outcrops marching into the desert, seemed as fanciful as stumbling on Shangri-La. But, suddenly, it was there – Wilpena Pound, a natural amphitheatre of ancient, fissured rock, glowing in the late-afternoon sun: simply bewitching. Remote, mysterious and attracting few visitors, the Flinders is the sort of epic landscape that seeps into your soul; a place of silence, soaring eagles and Dreamtime legend. It may just change you.

Mark Chipperfield Whale encounters I am a whale addict. I need to see one of these awe-inspiring and enigmatic creatures at regular intervals just to survive normal daily life. Since I saw my first whale more than three decades ago, I’ve been to more than 50 countries to see them, but one whale hotspot has had more impact on me than anywhere else: San Ignacio Lagoon, on the Pacific coast of Mexico. I’ve returned to tickle and scratch the unbelievably friendly grey whales in the lagoon every year since the late Eighties, and I miss it enormously when I’m somewhere else. Wildlife encounters don’t get much more humbling. For Mark Cawardine’s full guide to planning a whale-watching trip, go to telegraph.co.uk/whales .
