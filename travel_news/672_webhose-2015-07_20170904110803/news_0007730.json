He was arrested on a charge of criminal trespassing. \nThe man's name hasn't been released. \nThe flight was delayed because of the incident. Additional details about the flight weren't released. \nTSA spokesman Mike England says the agency is reviewing the incident and has added more barriers to screening areas at the airport.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T23:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T03:43:12.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
