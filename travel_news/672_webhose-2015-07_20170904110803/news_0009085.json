Landing such a designation is considered a major coup when it comes to being on the booking radar screens of meeting planners and tourism groups. Only 11 agencies received the DMAI accreditation this year. “This accreditation gives credibility to what NTCC does on a daily basis,” said John Percy , NTCC president and CEO. To become accredited, a DMO, or destination marketing organization, must demonstrate compliance across 16 disciplines and successfully comply with 58 mandatory and 30 voluntary standards in areas that include governance, finance, human resources, sales, communications, destination development and research. DMAP is globally recognized by the destination marketing industry as the highest achievement in destination excellence. “It says a great deal about us, both internally and externally,” said Patrick Kaler , Visit Buffalo Niagara president and CEO. “It says that we run our organization at the highest level possible. That matters to planners and booking agencies.” \nWant Buffalo Travel news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
