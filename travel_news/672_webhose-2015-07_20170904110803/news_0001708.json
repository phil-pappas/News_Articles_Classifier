Three other people with the woman thought that the employee had insulted her, and they joined in attacking him, the report said.\nThe 19-year-old employee said one of the people in the group of two men and two women was possibly the 25-year-old rapper, whose real name is Willie Maxwell II.\nPolice observed minor swelling on the employee’s face. The employee declined to press charges but was told he could do so at a later date. He could not be reached for comment.\nPolice Chief Kenneth Ehrenberg said detectives were working to establish the identities of the group, to learn their side of the story and in the event that the employee changed his mind about filing a complaint. It was not clear from Shop Rite surveillance footage or a cell phone video recorded by a witness, which was provided to the celebrity gossip website TMZ, if Fetty Wap was part of the group.\n“Maybe it looks like him,” the chief said. “We can’t go by, uh, it looks like him. We need more evidence than that.”\nA publicist for Fetty Wap could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday.\nBoth ShopRite and the police declined to release the surveillance video.\nEmail: greenj@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T22:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T23:12:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
