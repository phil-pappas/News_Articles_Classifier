Industry trade body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said that despite having a close working relationship with ministers, car bosses were completely unaware of plans for a new VED regime. “There is genuine concern in the industry about the way this was done,” said Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT. “We carried out a consultation on the impact of VED earlier this year but the Government did not talk to us ahead of the Budget announcement and we were very surprised at it. It was not even earmarked for change.” Under plans revealed in Wednesday’s Budget, from April 2017 motorists buying a new car will be subject to a “first year rate” levy based on the vehicle’s CO2 emissions, ranging from zero on cars that do not produce any exhaust gases to £2,000 for the most polluting cars. After the first year, VED will be charged at a flat rate of £140 a year for all but zero-emission cars – basically electrically-powered vehicles – which continue to pay nothing, while cars with a £40,000-plus list price will also pay an extra £320 a year for five years. However, the new rates could adversely impact British manufacturers, which are more biased towards premium vehicles in the £40,000 or more sector, with large producers including Jaguar and Land Rover. “The UK car industry produces a significant amount of premium cars and while it might not affect the higher end of the segment, it could have a big impact on fleet buyers,” said Mr Hawes, adding that VED has been proven to be a very influential part of car buyers’ decision-making processes. Jaguar is hoping to attract fleet buyers to its new XE model but VED changes may put them off “Fleet buyers also look at the life cost of a car and factor in VED. The increase is not going to encourage them to buy this sort of car,” he said. According to the SMMT even a relatively minor change in the duty when compared to a vehicle’s list price could have a great impact on some of the country’s niche manufacturers. Car companies such as Lotus and Caterham might only produce relatively small numbers of vehicles, but these tend to be in the premium part of the market and the new rates could put buyers off. Mr Hawes said: “We have a diverse car industry in the UK and we are trying to grow its production and how do you do that? By increasing sales. This is not helpful.” The SMMT said that the current VED system is “inequitable, unsustainable and in need of review” because advances in engine technology mean about two thirds of new cars on the road pay no VED as they produce only small amounts of CO2. However, while on the face of it the new regime appears to encourage buyers to purchase more environmentally friendly cars, it could backfire on the Government. As only zero-emission cars are zero rated, the new schedule offers no incentive for motorists to purchase hybrid engine cars which produce only small amounts of CO2 as they face the same VED rate as the most polluting vehicles. “While there is a clear incentive to buy zero-emission vehicles, it does nothing to encourage an increase in sales of ‘plug-in’ or hybrid vehicles,” said Mr Hawes. “These still command a premium price compared to conventionally powered cars.” Motorists are likely to opt for conventionally powered cars which produced more CO2 as these have lower list prices, he added.
