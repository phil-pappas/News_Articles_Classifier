Because city officials have just approved plans to build another giant pyramid or triangle-shaped structure, this time on the southwest edge of the city. \nAfter years of wrangling, opposition and rejection related to environmental and aesthetic concerns, Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo scored a major victory Monday after councillors narrowly approved plans to begin construction of the Tour Triangle, a soaring, 180-metre (590-foot) tower. \nSince first being introduced in 2008, the project has divided the city and generated heated debate, with critics charging that the project will become a glaring blight on the Paris skyline and supporters pointing out that the tower will create 5,000 jobs and new, modernised work spaces. \nWhen construction is complete, sometime in 2020, the tower will house a four-star hotel with 120 rooms; a sky bar; restaurants; office and retail spaces; as well as a child care centre, health centre and cultural centre for locals. \nThe 43-storey building, designed by Swiss architects Herzog and De Meuron, will be located at Porte de Versailles in the 15th arrondissement at a cost of around €500 million (RM2.08 billion). \nThe Tour Triangle will be the first skyscraper in Paris since the opening of the Tour Montparnasse in 1973, a building Parisians love to hate. \nThe ensuing uproar resulted in a height limit that banned the construction of buildings taller than 37 meters, and confined high-rise buildings to the city’s financial district, La Défense. \nIn 2010, the rules changed to allow for the erection of office buildings up to 180 m along the city periphery. \nThe city is already home to an iconic, glass pyramid structure at the Louvre. — AFP Relaxnews More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T16:17:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
