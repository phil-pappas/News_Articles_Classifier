To enable travel and tourism destinations and businesses to track and share their progress and demonstrate collective impact , the campaign is developing an open-source Impact Monitoring System . \nSkal International and Sustainable Travel International’s expressed their partnership and commitment to achieving these goals in a Memorandum of Understanding released today. Skal International brings to the campaign its membership drawn from all parts of the industry, including clubs in 85 countries, their member contacts within local and national governments and a vast network of in-depth local knowledge. \n“Skal International represents one of the biggest reservoirs of knowledge and cooperation in the industry,” said Nigel Pilkington, Skal’s Senior Vice President and Director, PR & Communications/Business Affairs. “Our reach can help scale up this effort and help the campaign meet its goals. We’re committed to helping our members improve lives and protect places, both because it’s the right thing to do, and because it will allow tourism businesses and destinations to remain relevant, competitive and attractive to the large and growing consumer segment that values transparency and accountability.” \nIn committing to the 10 MILLION BETTER campaign, Skal International joins other industry leaders including Carlson, Delaware North, Intrepid Travel, Sierra Club, and Starwood. The Sustainable Travel Leadership Network and Sustainable Destination Leadership Network—which include brands like A&K, Globus, Finnair, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines and United Airlines—have also committed to the campaign.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T03:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T05:21:09.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
