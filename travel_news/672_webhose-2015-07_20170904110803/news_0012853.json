Damien Duff is poised to sign for Shamrock Rovers Damien Duff is planning to swap Melbourne for Tallaght (Ashley Feder/Getty Images) John Fallon – 06 July 2015 08:10 AM\nThe 100-times capped winger had vowed to finish his decorated playing career in the League of Ireland, with the Hoops always the likely destination for his swansong.\nSt Patrick's Athletic provided the main competition to Rovers but the 36-year-old has always insisted that monetary gain wasn't his motivation in the selection process.\n\"As for the money thing, I'm not in it for the money,\" he stressed. \"It's for the joy of playing the game.\"\nBudgetary restrictions had constantly been cited by Rovers boss Pat Fenlon as a likely impediment to recruiting the two-time Premier League winner once Duff revealed in March his definitive plan to seek an Irish club when the transfer window opened in July.\nAlthough Rovers wouldn't comment on Duff's imminent signing last night, Fenlon will face questions on the topic today when the club hosts a pre-arranged press conference for their Europa League first-round second-leg tie against Progrès Niederkorn.\nThe teams played out a scoreless draw in last week's first leg in Luxembourg.\nShould Rovers prevail at Tallaght Stadium tomorrow and reach the second qualifying round, they'll be guaranteed to bank at least €410,000 from their first season back on the European stage in two years.\nIt would only be in the case they reach the third round that Duff could aid their Europa League run.\nThe Ballyboden man's A-League career was brought to a premature halt in February after suffering a serious ankle injury and he recently admitted that early August was his estimated return date.\nIreland team doctor Alan Byrne has been helping Duff regain his fitness since the player returned to his homeland but Rovers fans will have to wait a few more weeks to see one of the greatest players of his generation lining out in the green and white hoops.\nAdded to Stephen McPhail and Keith Fahey, Duff will become the third former Ireland international in Fenlon's squad, providing a welcome boost for Rovers' quest of bridging the 10-point buffer leaders and champions Dundalk enjoy over the third-placed side with 15 games left.\nDuff has kept busy since setting up home again for him and his family in Wicklow.\nFor the past two weeks, he's been amongst 28 pupils, including former Ireland pals Andy Keogh and Stephen Hunt, undertaking their UEFA B coaching license course at the AUL complex.\nPart of his syllabus required him to attend the recent game between St Patrick's Athletic and Longford Town at Inchicore.\nHe had the unenviable task of reporting back on Longford's attacking play despite them losing 3-0.\n\"My ma was upset, she thought I was signing for Pat's and I hadn't told her,\" joked Duff last week about his mother, Mary, who hails from a southside area of Dublin known as a Rovers stronghold. \"We were obviously just there to analyse the game.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.independent.ie/life/article31245463.ece/f3221/ALTERNATES/h342/2015-05-23_lif_9749249_I1.JPG", "http://www.independent.ie/incoming/article31353343.ece/945c2/ALTERNATES/h342/PIC%20DUFFER.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-06T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T16:43:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
