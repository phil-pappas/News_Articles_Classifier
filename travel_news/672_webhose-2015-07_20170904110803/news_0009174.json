On Friday, the humanoid robot took in a Red Sox game. \nThe robot is immobile and relies on strangers to transport it from place to place. It's the creation of two researchers in Canada who wanted to study how people interact with robots. The robot automatically documents its travels on social media. \nPreviously hitchBOT took 26 days to travel across Canada. Its creators said it had a slow start there, too, but then quickly zipped across the country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T19:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T19:34:54.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
