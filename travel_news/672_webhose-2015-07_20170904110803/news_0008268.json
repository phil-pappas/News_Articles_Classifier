However, their findings suggested that an excess methionine diet caused memory impairment and hyper-methylation that affected netrin expression, which was a protein important in maintaining synaptic plasticity and involved in axonal guidance and neurogenesis.\nThe story was presented at the Experimental Biology Meeting 2015.\n 27, 2015 2:52 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T04:13:46.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
