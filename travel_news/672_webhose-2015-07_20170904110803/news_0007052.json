Eisenhower is gaining design approvals to potentially move forward.\nThe project won approval Thursday in a 9-1 vote on final site and building plans at the National Capital Planning Commission. This was the second federal approval after the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts approved the design in June.\nArchitect Frank Gehry's design includes a memorial park with statues of Eisenhower and a large metal tapestry depicting the Kansas landscape of Ike's boyhood home.\nKansas Sen. Pat Roberts, the chairman of the Eisenhower Memorial Commission, says the 15-year project can now move toward completion.\nBuilding the $140 million memorial still requires funding. So far, $63 million has been appropriated by Congress. But some lawmakers want to block any further funding.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show the voice vote was 9-1 with one member was absent, rather than 10-1 vote.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T23:55:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
