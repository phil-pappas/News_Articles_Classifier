The beloved Book Fair will take place Nov. 15 – 22, 2015, at MDC’s Wolfson Campus in downtown Miami.\nMiami’s earliest flagship cultural event, the Book Fair will treat book lovers to eight days of cultural and educational activities, including the beloved Evenings With… series, the IberoAmerican Authors program, literacy and learning activities for children/teens during Generation Genius Days, and The Kitchen demos and panels for food enthusiasts in partnership with the MDC’s Miami Culinary Institute. Fairgoers will also enjoy more than 200 exhibitors from around the country selling books in a festive atmosphere in addition to hundreds of authors reading and discussing new books during the weekend Street Fair, Nov. 20 – 22.\nThis year, in partnership with Miami news and culture website The New Tropic (thenewtropic.com), the Book Fair will feature a new community engagement project: MiamiMadLibs! All are invited to submit extra-short Miami-inspired stories with words missing, or are invited to fill in the blanks in short stories or poems written by some of Miami’s favorite authors. MiamiMadLibs! social writing events and readings will take place during the months leading up to the Book Fair at spots throughout Miami. Submissions will be accepted in English, Spanish or Creole. There is no limit to how many stories one can submit. Submission dates are July 15 through November 22 at [email protected] and through social media using the hashtag #MiamiMadLibs! A selection of stories written and submitted by Miamians will be available for download on the Fair’s website. Full directions will be up on the website by July 15.\nContinuing this year is The Swamp, a pop-up lounge featuring live music and writers whose works explore the cultural life of the Sunshine State. The Swamp is made possible by a grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, as part of its Knight Arts Challenge.\nBook Fair organizers are out to prove that Miami loves to read and that Miami’s a place where book culture happens, so they are also asking readers (and fans of the Fair) to post selfies with their favorite books, or shelfies (selfies with their bookshelves), with the hashtag #MiamiReads. They can tag the Miami Book Fair’s social media channels — Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.\nSource:-Tourism Miami\nRelated Posts HBAA – Treat yourself in Trinity’s charity auction MIA Director, National Counterparts Travel To Washington, D.c.
