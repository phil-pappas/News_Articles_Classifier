It also lets us reflect on the unique stories of the people buried there. Many cemetery visitors say the experience can be profoundly spiritual.\nTips for visiting a cemetery as a tourist Irene S. Levine Before your visit, read guidebooks and/or the cemetery website, so you know what to expect. Before your visit, read guidebooks and/or the cemetery website, so you know what to expect. ( Irene S. Levine ) Loren Rhoads of San Francisco, author of \"Wish You Were Here: Adventures in Cemetery Travel\" ( http://www.cemeterytravel.com has visited so many cemeteries over the years that she's lost count. \"I've easily visited hundreds,\" she said. \"Before our daughter was born, my husband and I made an East Coast tour where we visited 17 cemeteries in 11 days.\"\n\"A surprising number of people visit cemeteries,\" Rhoads said. (The most enthusiastic among them are known as taphophiles, or grave hunters.) \"Their interests range from genealogy to photography, history, art, iconography, landscaping, architecture, bird-watching, gardening and restoration,\" she said. She pointed out that many parklike cemeteries with magnificent trees and plantings serve as arboretums and wildlife refuges. Some offer breathtaking views of mountains, rivers and streams.\nWith few exceptions, cemeteries traditionally have welcomed the public with open gates and free admission. Many offer maps or paper guides that highlight notable graves as well as noteworthy statues, monuments, mausoleums, chapels or architectural structures. Nearby residents and tourists alike appreciate the serenity of these sanctuaries, especially those who like to walk or run in a setting where they can commune with nature, much as in a public park.\n\"Tourism gives us an opportunity to showcase the art, culture and historical significance of our cemetery to a wider audience,\" said David L. Ison, executive director of The Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx borough of New York.\nMany cemeteries offer guided tours led by volunteer and paid docents, lectures, concerts, art exhibits and light shows and hold scheduled holiday, seasonal and special events. They also collaborate with outside tour companies and provide outreach to local schools, civic organizations, scholars and senior citizen groups.\nc Comments Got something to say?

Add a comment 0 Advances in technology over the last two decades have simultaneously popularized cemetery tourism and enhanced the experience for visitors. Tourists are finding cemetery visits listed among the top attractions on TripAdvisor ( http://www.tinyurl.com/gravefinder both in the U.S. and abroad. Many have extensive websites, Facebook pages and legions of social media followers.\nFind A Grave ( http://www.findagrave.com created by taphophile Jim Tipton in 1995, is a searchable, crowdsourced (and, thus, prone to some errors) online database of 132 million grave records at cemeteries in more than 200 countries. Users can contribute information or use the website at no cost to search for graves of relatives or famous people. Some entries include GPS coordinates on Google Maps, and many display photos of headstones and epitaphs. The website, which was acquired by Ancestry.com in 2013, also has a free mobile app.\nA number of cemeteries have developed smartphone apps or audio tours that enable users to locate gravesites during a visit. For example, by downloading a free self-guided tour at The Woodlawn Cemetery in New York, jazz aficionados can find the graves of Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Max Roach, Lionel Hampton, Illinois Jacquet or other luminaries.\nUsing GPS technology, the app guides them to within 10 feet of each grave and allows them to download relevant Wikipedia entries, videos and/or music on their smartphone. The app includes other thematic tours too, focusing on architectural treasures, black history, civic leaders, Civil War heroes, entertainers, memorable women, significant sculptures and more.\n\"The idea of cemetery tourism may seem new and shocking, but actually cemeteries have been sites of pilgrimage from the beginning,\" Rhoads writes. With the growing number of cremations and green burials, cemeteries will continue to evolve and change as preservationists and cemetery tourists protect and honor past traditions.\nIrene S.
