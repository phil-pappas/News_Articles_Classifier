Higher costs associated with travelling, combined with American workers taking fewer vacations translates into an increase in online bookings for shorter stays.\n“The silver lining is that there are vacation homes within an hour drive from most large cities,” says Vaknin. “Frugal-minded Americans can still experience a getaway in a vacation rental home at the fraction of a hotel price.”\nThe internet has made the off-season a more attractive travel time. “Vacation rental home websites, such as HomeEscape, give owners the opportunity to respond to market trends by offering nightly rates and special offers,” says Vaknin.\nFor second homeowners and property managers, Vaknin offers these tips to increase off-season bookings:\nInstitute Nightly Rates. Whereas peak season demands week-long stays, the off-season can be much more flexible. Try offering nightly rates to capture travelers looking to book a long weekend.\nIntroduce Special Offers. Off-season deals, such as “Stay three nights, get one free” and senior citizen and military discounts, attract travelers who have the flexibility to travel whenever.” Entice past guests with special incentives such as a welcome amenity or a gift-certificate to a local restaurant.\n“Winterize.” Advertise local attractions – such as a ski resort, mountain hikes, or better yet a cozy photograph of your fireplace. If your rental lacks winter appeal, consider adding a hot tub.\nAccept pets. According to recent statistics, more than 29 million Americans brought their pets on trips further than 50 miles away, according to the Travel Industry Association of America. People with their “other children,” (their pets) are a huge market and an important one not to miss out on.\nAbout HomeEscape: Headquartered in Miami, Florida, HomeEscape connects homeowners and property managers with travelers who seek the space, value and amenities of vacation rental homes as an alternative to hotels.
