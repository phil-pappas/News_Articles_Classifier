Police said that John Houser killed two people and wounded nine others before killing himself during a showing of \"Trainwreck.\"The shooting evoked memories of the 2012 shooting at a theater in Aurora, Colorado, in which 12 people were killed and scores of others wounded. On social media Friday, some people lamented that they no longer felt safe at movie theaters, saying they would stay away and wait to catch new releases when they're available at home. And several theater employees across the U.S. said they were shaken up, wondering if their theater would be next. But crowds kept coming, unfazed by the news. Tracy Haasz said she had a long conversation about the Lafayette shooting in the morning, but said she didn't even think of it hours later as she went to a Dallas theater with her 9-year-old son. \"It didn't factor as we were making the decision just 15 minutes ago,\" said Haasz, 52. Outside a Boston ticket office, Richard Force considered that among thousands of U.S. movie theaters, two shootings represented only a tiny fraction. \"It's an unacceptable percentage, but it's very small,\" said Force, 57, who was visiting from Houston with his wife, Angela. \"It hasn't changed our movie-going habits.\" 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T04:17:56.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
