Giving a child its Christian name and dedicating the little one to God: these are momentous milestones to be cherished and remembered for years to come. \nTo mark such a joyous occasion, it’s customary to bring a gift for the child. We realize that purchasing something meaningful for a child too young to hold up its own head, let alone open its mouth to offer suggestions, can be a challenge. This is why we’ve put together the following list of christening gift ideas. \nBut before we begin, let us say that we’re especially fond of personalized gifts that the child can keep forever. Such gifts offer that extra sentimental value, something that can hold meaning for the child well into his or her life. And parents love them! \nWith that said and without further ado, our best christening gift ideas: A Bible with the child’s initials engraved . \nThis one stands at the top of the list for obvious reasons. As the child grows into a young adult and faith takes greater and greater importance, he or she will want a Bible to turn to. And how nice it is to have one with a history, one that came from the loving hand of a family member or family friend! In addition, Bible storybooks will be a good option for when they are a little older. Engraved bracelet or necklace . \nTypically these gifts go to little girls, but these days there are many options for boys as well. Either way, a quality bracelet with a message inscribed on it or a necklace with an engraved pendant will be something the child can wear right away and then set aside as a keepsake for many more years. Framed message or scripture . \nWrite a brief, personalized message, and have it professionally printed and framed. Or pick out a favorite (and relevant) passage from scripture and have that framed. Custom burp cloths . \nLet’s be honest, a new baby isn’t all sunshine and rainbows. They spit up. A lot. So, why not have some custom burp cloths made? They can offer funny or reassuring sayings that will make the baby’s parents smile while doing a thankless job. Name sign . \nHave a custom-made sign with the baby’s name on it. The name can be written in colorful curlicues or in any other creative way you can think of. You can also have the name’s meaning written beneath the name itself. Personalized christening saucer . \nOften made from ceramic and inscribed with the child’s name, date of christening, and a scripture, this gift offers something special that the child can hold onto forever. Christening cake . \nMaybe nothing quite sounds right as a gift. How about going to your local specialty baker and having a beautiful cake made for the after party? Or, if you’re a talented baker yourself, you can bake and decorate the cake . Silver birth-certificate holder or money box . \nAs the most traditional material for christening gifts, silver always goes over well. Typically, these gifts will bear some inspirational message or scripture. Baptismal towel . \nFor drying off the baby after its baptism, you can have the towel stitched with the baby’s name, the date of the christening, and a scripture or personal message. Embroidered stuffed animal . \nBuy him or her a stuffed lamb or teddy bear , and have it embroidered with a personalized message or scripture. \nA baby’s christening is a joyous day, one to celebrate with friends and family. You’ll want to help celebrate with a gift, and here you have our ten best christening gift ideas for the new addition to your family or church family. 0 Flares   0 0 Flares × ← Wildwood   About Melinda \nMelinda is half of the mom & dad blogging team from LookWhatMomFound...and Dad too!
