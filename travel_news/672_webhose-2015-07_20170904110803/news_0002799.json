The problem at the moment is that our trains are full.” \nPassenger numbers rose 3 per cent to 2.8 million in the three months through June as growth resumed following a flat first quarter, when a fire shut the Channel Tunnel and an attack on the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine clipped demand. While a weaker euro is encouraging Britons to travel to the continent, sales are strong across all sectors, Petrovic said. \n“The French market is definitely getting better,” the CEO said, adding that the impact of government initiatives aimed at helping business is “filtering through,” while the strong pound has not hurt inbound UK visits as much as feared. “We were expecting the leisure market to suffer, but it’s still OK. And the American market is coming back after Charlie Hebdo.” \nMarseille boost \nBookings on Eurostar’s 6 1/2 hours service to Marseille, which began May 1, have reached 88,000, with trains typically running with 500-600 passengers, or as much as 80 per cent full. \nThe 200-mile-an-hour e320s will seat 900 people, one-fifth more than the current Eurostars based on Alstom SA’s TGV design. The Siemens units have bigger seats, free Wi-Fi and interiors from Italian auto-stylist Pininfarina. A follow-on order for seven more sets worth about US$600 million (RM2.27 billion) was placed in November. \nEurostar is also refurbishing 14 of the Alstom trains, with the first re-entering service in August and the rest due for overhaul in the next 2 1/2 years. The interiors of the vehicles, renamed e300s, will be virtually identical to the new e320s, and it’s possible some of the 10 other classic sets will be upgraded to prolong their life and meet capacity needs, Petrovic said. \nEurostar is adding passengers at a time when cross-Channel travel has “never been so competitive,” the executive said, with long-distance buses and the Paris-based BlaBlaCar ride- sharing service competing at the budget end of the market and low-cost airlines led by EasyJet Plc and network carriers including British Airways also “fighting hard.” \nThe introduction of services to Amsterdam has slipped into 2017 from December 2016 as work continues on establishing a safety case in the Netherlands, where Eurostar hasn’t operated before, and on gaining timetabling paths, Petrovic said. — Bloomberg  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T07:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T08:24:33.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
