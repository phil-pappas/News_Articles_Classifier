Sign In Here Nothing about converting a 100-year-old bank building into a modern luxury hotel is easy, but add historic murals to the walls of the gigantic lobby of that building, and the conversion becomes even trickier. Sixteen murals – originally painted for the Colorado National Bank building at 17th and Champa streets in 1925 by Western muralist Allen Tupper True – were preserved and restored in the grand lobby of what is now the Renaissance Denver Downtown City Center hotel. Because the murals of Native Americans were painted on the walls of the historic building, vibrations from renovation demolition had to be kept to a minimum. Engineers installed a monitor to measure vibrations from power tools, as too much disturbance could displace the oil-on-canvas murals from the plaster. “We had to make sure the paintings were kept as they were,” said Bill Newell, principal at Monroe Newell, a local engineering firm that has done a lot of work in historic downtown buildings. “All the way through construction we had to protect those paintings.” The potential for damage was not insignificant: Engineers had to find a way to take out huge bank vaults with 16- to 18-inch concrete walls without creating too much vibration. They also had to basically cut a hole in the center of the rectangular building to create a courtyard that provided natural lighting for the inner hotel rooms. In addition to those challenges, the building was built in three different phases with different load specifications and no shear walls. That meant they had to construct micropiles, or foundation elements made of small steel casing or threaded bar, throughout the building. “I’ve been doing this for 42 years … and most of the buildings in LoDo, I’ve touched once or twice,” Newell said. “This one was the most complicated structural job I’ve ever worked on. We did Union Station, too, and this was more technical than that.” After five years of planning, design and painstaking renovations, the 230-room Renaissance Denver Downtown City Center hotel opened its doors in May 2014. Developer Stonebridge Companies invested more than $50 million in the adaptive reuse project, ensuring the integrity and heritage of the historic building would be maintained. That investment included more than 4,000 man-hours of labor and specialized expertise that were spent in the restoration of the ceilings, murals, vaults and marble work. “We are proud to give one of Denver’s most beloved local landmarks new life as a luxury hotel,” said Navin Dimond , president and CEO of Stonebridge Companies, owner and operator of the hotel. “There is something special about being able to help connect visitors to the city with a piece of its past.” The Colorado National Bank building was designed in 1915 by well-known Denver architects William and Arthur Fisher. The building’s neo-classical, Greek revival architecture is evident in its large white exterior columns and walls, created with the same Colorado marble used to build the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. Still, Dimond had to fight to get the former bank building listed on the National Register of Historic Places, because the project wasn’t considered a true historic structure, but an architectural hybrid, as its initial construction in 1915 had been supplemented by an addition in 1926 and another in the 1960s. After extensive effort, Stonebridge successfully got the building listed on the historic register and received tax increment financing (TIF), secured in partnership with the Denver Urban Renewal Authority. Dimond had a vision for the former bank building at a time when the debt markets were tight and hospitality investments weren’t popular. It was 2009 – in the heart of the recession – and “the market was in the gutter,” Dimond said. The building had been vacant for a couple of years, as its enormous bank lobby seemed too daunting to convert to an office building. “The challenge was, when you walk into the building, you see this giant atrium space,” he said. “People who wanted offices looked at it and struggled to figure out what to do with it. I looked at it and saw a hotel lobby.” Stonebridge has developed hotels around the world, and had the reputation and balance sheet to get loans when banks were hesitant to lend. “Given the time frame of 2009, they had trust in our balance sheet,” he said. “There are a lot of creative people who could have done it, but we had the balance sheet.” Plus, the bank that ultimately approved a construction loan for the project – Minneapolis-based U.S. Bank – had once been a tenant of the building. U.S. Bank acquired Colorado National Bank in 1997, and remained in the building until about 2007. “We were excited about the opportunity to work with Navin and his company,” said Ralph Pace, Colorado market manager for U.S. Bank Commercial Real Estate. “Furthermore, it was exciting to be associated with a historic building that we have ties with.” Pace said the economy was starting to turn around and Dimond’s reputation as a hotel developer was stellar, so the project was “a perfect fit for us.” “It was a very complicated project and Navin and his team handled in beautifully,” he said. “You walk into the lobby of the hotel and you feel like you’re in the bank when you’re in there.” Preserving the building’s heritage for the Denver community was critical to Dimond. “Denver’s been my home for 30 years, so certainly that’s important to me,” he said. “The building demanded a level of commitment. It’s 100 years old this year, and certain things just demand that level of detail and attention.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T14:49:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
