In the 1990s, he was a Seattle police warrant officer whopressed the department to reform its dysfunctional warrant system.\nKrohn also co-founded Equal Rights Washington, an advocacy group that lobbied for anti-discrimination legislation and same-sex marriage rights. This may not seem directly relevant to the Port job, but it demonstrates the ability of Krohn — a Republican — to work cooperatively on complex and controversial government issues.\nOn the controversy over Shell’s temporary use of Terminal 5, Krohn said he would have supported the lease and he opposes any effort to turn the shipping facility over to developers for a mixed-use project.\nLike almost every commissioner candidate, Krohn is concerned about the transparency and the accountability of Port staff to the commission and the public.\nKrohn’s suggested changes include redirecting audit reports to the commission, not the chief executive, and requiring that the appointment of department heads be approved by the commission.\nAmong the other candidates, Ken Rogers has a firm grasp on aviation and fiscal issues as a recent board member of Delta Air Lines and a longtime pilot and labor leader at the company.\nBut the Port is now drawing heat for being too favorable in plans for international airport facility improvements to Delta, which is aggressively challenging hometown carrier Alaska Airlines. That would make the presence of Rogers on the commission problematic.\nSimilarly, candidate Darrell Bryan has a distinguished career in transportation and maritime industries and a keen understanding of the Port’s role in the regional economy. But Bryan’s effectiveness pressing for change and more transparency could be limited by his longstanding ties to the Port as a co-owner of Victoria Clipper, a prominent tenant.\nFred Fellemen, an environmental advocate running for the job, is eloquent and persuasive. Yet his election would risk further alienating industrial customers who see the Port becoming less agnostic and more subject to Seattle politicking.\nKrohn may also face potential conflicts as a railroad employee and labor lobbyist.\nBut they are outweighed by Krohn’s record of fighting for the public interest, his plans for adjusting the balance of power between the commission and Port staff and his firm support for the Port’s industrial and job-creation activity.\nEditorial board members are editorial page editor Kate Riley, Frank A.
