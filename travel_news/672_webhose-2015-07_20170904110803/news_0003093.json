The events of the past few weeks have\nbeen testimony to that.\nBut even so football can also be a great release from the stresses and strains of life.\nFor players and fans last Sunday’s Showdown was an opportunity to let out all the emotions\nand feelings that have been bubbling inside since the tragic death of Phil Walsh.\nFor the players it was a chance to both remember their much loved coach but to also to briefly\nforget the circumstances of his passing as they lost themselves in the passion and emotion of one of the greatest Showdowns I have seen.\nScroll down for Trudie’s blog, which starts at 12.30pm\nIt was a Showdown to remember. One built on emotion to honour a coach who has left both clubs with a legacy to cherish and build on. It will be forever etched in the memories of all football fans, both young and old and brought fans of two rival teams together, albeit briefly.\nThe fans likewise were again swept up in the magic that only football can provide and as a fan of 25 years I have never been prouder of my club and team.\nIn some ways the question now is — what happens next?\nThe Crows can’t let this be another case of Showdown let-down. They have to use the foundations that Phil Walsh left them with to create their own legacy. They must find a way to keep working on their skills to achieve elite standards. They must work for each other and as a team to achieve the goals that Phil knew they could reach.\nAnd it is time for a new group of Crows to create a new legacy for the club. Walsh’s time at the Crows was horribly brief but it must count for something. His influence, passion and desire must live within the players and lift them to greater heights as individuals and as a\nteam.\nI have been a Crows supporter since the beginning. I was there for the near misses and for the triumphs. Perhaps for too long Adelaide as a club has focused on the stories of the past, rather than concentrating on the possibilities the future can hold.\nStarting with the Gold Coast this weekend, the Crows, the players, the fans, all of us have the chance to start again. It will be a hard road but one they need to travel.\nOne Eyed Rant (Frame content direct link: http://embed.scribblelive.com/Embed/v7.aspx?Id=1394642&ThemeId=16707 .)", "external_links": ["http://embed.scribblelive.com/Embed/v7.aspx?Id=1394642&ThemeId=16707"], "published": "2015-07-22T17:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T03:50:06.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
