(AP) -- Rescuers have come to the aid of several Appalachian Trail hikers in New Hampshire, who are coping with slippery trails due to thunderstorms and humidity. Fish and Game Department conservation officers say one of the hikers, Kimberly Crisman of Annapolis, Maryland, had left from Georgia over two months ago in an effort to complete the entire Appalachian Trail. The trail runs from Georgia to Maine, and this is the time of year when many hikers attempting to complete it travel through New Hampshire. Crisman was injured on Wednesday while staying at a shelter on Smarts Mountain. Another hiker, Sara Rognstad of Jackson, Tennessee, was injured Wednesday in a fall near the summit of Mount Cube in Orford. Both were taken to hospitals for an evaluation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T19:39:28.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
