His mother, Freda, died last month at the age of 97 and so he and his brother David and sister Katherine are selling the property where they grew up, and which has been barely changed in 63 years. The 1950s decor was kept pristine by Mrs Close and her late husband Robert, who died in 1999, with the vividly-coloured carpets and wallpaper harking back to just after the war. (Hunters/PA Wire) (Hunters/PA Wire) The home in Allendale Road, Stockton, Teesside, is on sale for Â£235,000, boasts a hall, three reception rooms and four bedrooms. It also has a large garden with fruit trees. Mr Close, who has a vineyard in the south of France having worked in the oil business, said his parents bought the house from its original owner John Lewis, the man who built it in 1909. His parents retained the mahogany doors that Mr Lewis put in more than a century ago. (Hunters/PA Wire) (Hunters/PA Wire) \"My father was an engineer and he put in one of the first central heating systems in the Stockton area, with one-and-a-half inch pipes running around the place and the old cast iron radiators,\" he said. \"All three of us were brought up in that house and we had a great time. It was a lovely family home to grow up in. \"My mother passed away a month ago. She had her 97th birthday party in the garden and it was a very jolly affair.\" (Hunters/PA Wire) (Hunters/PA Wire) The 69-year-old explained that once his parents had spent a lot on the heating system and decorating the place, they were happy with the style and did not update the look, preferring to maintain it. The property is for sale through estate agent Hunters.
