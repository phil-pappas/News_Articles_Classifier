And since Gary Bell is an obliging kind of fellow, he indulges me with a peek. There's been a not unexpected trip to Glyndebourne – well, after all, Gary is an eminent QC. Nudging alongside, however, is a visit to Cotgrave in Nottingham for a miners' welfare event . Clearly, then, this must be one of those right-on white collar professionals – in this case, one of the country's leading criminal barristers - keen to flag up a social conscience. Well, actually not quite. Gary's attendance at the miners' do was, quite literally a trip down memory lane, since it was in this town that he was born to a dirt-poor coalmining family. Gary was destined for a life working in the mines (AFP) Indeed far from a career in the law, Gary was destined him for life down the pit. His early childhood home was a condemned slum and he left his tough comprehensive school without taking any exams. \"When I told our school careers officer I wanted to be a long-distance lorry driver, he just beamed at me and said, 'Great, you can get an HGV licence if you work at the pit.' In fact it didn't matter what we said at school – our lives seemed mapped out this way. One friend said he wanted to be an astronaut – the response was that he could get used to working on his own in the dark by going down the coalmine...\" He breaks off, to shake his head sadly…\"It makes you wonder how many other youngsters who could have gone on to become lawyers – or doctors, entrepreneurs or scientists – have instead ended up working in entirely suitable areas because no one thought to encourage them?\" On The Legalizer, Gary helps claimants get back money they're owed (John Lawrence) With this heritage in mind, it was perhaps a reason why Gary took on the role of The Legalizer for a BBC1 consumer programme – now heading for a second series – in which he helps claimants as they take their cases through the small claims court. A legal hero? Maybe. Yet for Gary there was no fabled helping hand – be it inspirational teacher or fairy godmother mentor to set him on his way. In fact, as Gary details with unvarnished candour in his riotous new autobiography, Animal QC , he did indeed work at the local mine, before spending the next few years as a homeless unemployed drifter in London and abroad. • They had never used the internet. Then they logged on Shelf stacker, fireman, forklift truck driver, pork pie production line worker... It's all listed on an astonishing CV which culminates in Gary taking silk three years ago. So how on earth did he do it? Actually, he got an early education in the law. \"In my early 20s I was arrested for fraud after I learnt how to get money out of slot machines.\" (He doesn't share the knowledge.) \"I got a 6 month suspended sentence.\" Ah, so was this the epiphany? \"Not really\" says Gary phlegmatically. \"Just taught me not to get caught.\" Though he has had an unblemished criminal record ever since. Gary eventually decided to become a barrister (Alamy) After years of drifting – and spotting a solicitor getting out of a Jaguar one morning - Gary finally realised his only way to improve his life was to get an education. \"Though when I told my mother I wanted to be a barrister, she said 'people like us don`t become bloody barristers, get yourself a proper job.\" Night school followed where he duly took O 'levels and A ‘levels before, at the age of 24, landing an interview at Bristol university to study law. He received notification while visiting a girlfriend in Germany and took two days to hitchhike back home. • The UK's most competitive law degree courses \"At the interview they asked me what my dad did, which led inevitably to talk about mining. The interviewing panel said life must be very hard, and so I admitted I’d hitchhiked to get there. To my astonishment one of the professors pulled a £20 note out of his pocket and explained that the university had a hardship fund. I wasn't about to accept charity and said so. So they just said, well thanks for coming to the interview and you're in. If Arthur Scargill did nothing else in 1984 at least he helped me realise my dream.\" Gary's friend and debating partner Michael Gove (Eddie Mulholland) At Bristol he honed his skill as a world-class debater – sparring with the likes of Michael Gove (who remains a close friend), before embarking on his legal career. Was this a desire to become accepted? \"Not at all,\" he chuckles, \"I just wanted to succeed.\" He may not have wanted establishment credentials, but he has achieved them vicariously after marrying fellow Bristol graduate, Sophie Fitzhugh. An old girl of Godolphin and Latymer School , her family, who are listed in Burke's Landed gentry, are related to both Clive of India and Henry the VIII's sixth wife, Catherine Parr. \"In spite of her – or perhaps because of her privileged background - Sophie was a committed socialist and was absolutely fascinated by my lowly origins.\" • Why are there so few female screenwriters? Little wonder an early platonic date comprised a trip to watch his beloved Nottingham Forest followed by supper at the Cotgarve pit canteen. Twenty six years later, the couple have three children – none of whom are interested in going into the law: Harry is studying European politics, Toby is at Exeter doing economics and Emily is at Rugby School. Family remains critically important . Gary admits to being an utterly devoted father and remains close to his four siblings. None followed his path to university (though one of his sisters, a registrar, did have the pleasure of marrying Ed and Justine Miliband ). His mother died in 1981 before he sat his O 'levels, so never saw her son realise his dream. (The dedication to his mother at the front of the book reads how she would not have thought \"the majority of it was possible and still wouldn't believe it now\". He has seen his father perhaps five times in the 40 years since he left his wife and family. These days aside from his spectacular legal career, Gary spends his time, \"drinking lots of wine and playing golf\". His untapped ambition is to become a children's author –six years ago he self-published Toby and the Great Stink which garnered a strong, online following. Benign, witty and effortlessly charming, Gary Bell certainly seems a far cry from the animal of the title. The nickname, in fact, dates back to the late Seventies, when Gary enjoyed something of a parallel career as one of the best known football hooligans in Nottingham. (\"Thanks to 30 pints at the weekend and a diet of kebabs and Chinese which pushed my weight to15 stone\") • Royal christenings around the world One morning, he joined his mates on the bus to a match, carrying a block of Walls ice cream and a packet of wafers. \"I simply put a wafer at the end of each block and ate it. To which one of my startled mates remarked 'I don't believe it. You're a animal.' It sort of stuck.\" An image perhaps which best explains the complex trajectory of Gary Bell's life: from the hard wafery edges of the miners club to the soft ice cream sweetness of Glyndebourne. A difficult combination for the pork pie man turned barrister – but one which finally has made life taste good.
