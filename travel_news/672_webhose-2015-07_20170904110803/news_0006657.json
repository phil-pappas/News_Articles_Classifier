It said similar events took place when the painting, depicting a woman in a kimono, travelled throughout Japan for an exhibition.\nBut protesters have held signs at the Boston museum's events, calling them \"racist\" and \"imperialist.\"\nThe museum says kimonos will now be on display Wednesday evenings for visitors to touch, not try on.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T14:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T06:04:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
