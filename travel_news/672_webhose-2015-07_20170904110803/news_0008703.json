But not flimsy sandals with something sticking between two toes to hold them on. Rather the kind that have serious tread, a webbed covering over the foot, and the ability to dry quickly after getting soaking wet. Like these Ahnu Del Rey sandals . (For women the name is Tilden V.) \nIt’s probably more fitting to call these multi-purpose shoes since they’re so substantial. You could hike in them and plow through streams. Or go white water rafting in them. Then walk around a city for six hours in them after they dried. All the while your feet will stay ventilated since they’re not enclosed, just held in place. \nYou get like “Numentum Traverse” technology that’s supposed to provide “neutral foot positioning through various impacts, speed and motion.” That’s a hard thing to test for, but I can say that with the adjustable web system with buckles my feet haven’t been sliding around any. That’s despite the fact I’ve been putting them on and off without unbuckling them. If you want to really tighten them up before adventure activities though, the heel has an adjustment strap as well. There’s good toe protection in the front, a “shock dispersal plate” built in, and serious lugged tread on the bottom. \nThe problem with something rugged that can do so much is is that all that tread and cushioning can add up to something a bit heavy to pack. Each year footwear is getting collectively lighter though thanks to advances in technology and now the Del Rey sandals from Ahnu weigh in at a reasonable 11 ounces. Not bad for something you could wear every week for a year in multiple conditions. \nThese travel sandals are comfortable enough to wear every day and could be that go-to main pair of shoes for a long-term traveler. They’re extremely comfortable, in part thanks to the soft webbing that’s between your feet and the top straps. I’ve been wearing these for walks of several miles, including hills and trails, and there has been no point where something is rubbing against my feet and creating soreness. With the web adjustment system, these will work for a variety of foot shapes too, something you can’t say about a lot of regular shoes with a fixed upper. \nThe Ahnu Del Rey sandals come in sizes from 7.5 to 13 and in four colors. See more info at the company site and pick them up for $100 or less at Moosejaw , Backcountry , or Zappos . \nThe very similar women’s version (same price) is called the Tilden V and is also available at Moosejaw and Zappos .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T03:00:28.091+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
