Bali Ragawisata to manage Swissôtel Bali, a new 170-room resort scheduled to open in late 2017. Situated on a striking cliff top in Bukit Pandawa, an expansive and upscale master-planned resort development, Swissôtel Bali will enjoy an enviable location on the island, mere minutes from top attractions favoured by international jet-setters and a short drive from the Ngurah Rai (Denpasar) International Airport. \nDesigned by TONTON Studio, a leading design firm with extensive experience in high-end hotel development across Indonesia, the resort will offer scenic views of the Indian Ocean from stunning guestrooms featuring spacious outdoor balconies. Completing the guest experience will be a private beach club, four exquisite dining outlets including a spectacular bar, the brand’s signature Pürovel Spa & Sport, and 400 square metres (4,300 square feet) of indoor meeting space with outdoor function areas. “This is an exciting new addition for the Swissôtel brand and a perfect complement to our company’s growing portfolio of city and resort destinations throughout Asia and worldwide,” said Wayne Buckingham, senior vice president, Asia Pacific, FRHI Hotels & Resorts. “In keeping with Swissôtel’s brand promise of promoting quality in life, the resort will offer a very inspiring atmosphere which will be bolstered with local attributes authentic to the locale. To be pairing an unbelievable resort product with the natural paradise that is Bali is nothing short of magic.” “We are extremely pleased to be partnering with FRHI on this new Swissôtel resort project and look forward to working with them to create a truly world-class property,” said Djie Tjian An, PT. Bali Ragawisata. “Bali is a thriving holiday destination popular with travellers from all over the world who are looking for the ultimate mix of relaxation, adventure and cultural flair; Swissôtel will deliver against this and more.” Located between Java and Lombok, Bali is an island with a population of 3.9 million. It is one of Asia’s leading vacation hotspots and the largest tourist destination in the country, recording more international arrivals than Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia. In addition to its world-famous beaches, Bali is renowned for its highly developed arts, including traditional and modern dance, sculpture, painting, leather, metalworking, and music. Swissôtel Hotels & Resorts, renowned for its Swiss inspired hospitality, is extending its international reach with plans to open a number of new developments in the coming years. Projects are slated for China, India, Russia and Turkey as well as other exciting destinations globally.
