Thome, eTN Africa Correspondent | Jul 09, 2015 Adv: \nSudan Airways has launched flights from Khartoum to Abu Dhabi, the UAEâ€™s capital city, with initially three services a week. The flights will operate out of KRT every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. It was learned that the service will alternately use either an Airbus A320 or a Boeing B737, configured in a two class cabin layout. \nThe UAE enjoys high popularity among Sudanese travelers who fly to the country to shop, for medical purposes and of course to trade, and traffic volumes suggest that Sudan Airways will sooner rather than later look at increasing flights between the two destinations. \nAccording to a websearch does Sudan Airways currently also fly to Jeddah, Riyadh, Sharjah, Dubai and Doha while in Africa serving Cairo, Asmara, Addis Ababa, Kano, Juba and several domestic destinations inside the Sudan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T09:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T21:21:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
