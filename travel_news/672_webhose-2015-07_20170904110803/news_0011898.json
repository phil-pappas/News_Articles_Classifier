The good news is the lovely people at GAZE film festival have put together a programme of films which will keep you entertained, while you hide away from any rain.\nGAZE International LGBT Film Festival Dublin is now in its 23rd year, and will once again be taking over the Light House Cinema, Smithfield for the August Bank Holiday weekend. 2015 has been a special year for the LGBT community in Ireland, and the festival will provide another chance to celebrate the progress that has been made. It kicks off tonight with a gala screening of Out to Win, a documentary looking at the lives and careers of gay athletes all across the world.\nThe organisers of the festival have also been sure to remember countries where the LGBT community still face huge struggles. A Sinner in Mecca looks at the life of a gay man living in Saudi Arabia, a country where filmmaking and homosexuality are illegal, while To Russia with Love examines Russia's anti-gay legislation and the run up to the 2014 winter Olympics.\nIrish contributions to the weekend include The Participants, the latest film from director Paul Rawley, and a screening of Breakfast on Pluto, which features a wonderfully camp performance from Cillian Murphy.\nGAZE is sponsored by consulting firm, Accenture, and runs over the entire August bank holiday weekend, from July 30th to August 3rd 2015. You can find out more about the films playing during the festival and how to purchase your tickets at http://www.gaze.ie.\nMORE: Watch: Katherine Heigl comes out to her parents in trailer for Jenny's Wedding\nMORE: A village in England was taken over by 500 swingers this weekend, and residents are not happy\nMORE: Dustin Hoffman and the state of film and television right now", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T19:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T15:21:12.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
