We were going sideways, up and down,' said one traveler. 'We dropped a good 300 feet, at least. \nHis companion chimed in: 'I thought the plane was going down, actually.' \nAmerican has seven Dreamliners, which carry a list price of $224.6million each after a recent 2.9 per cent price hike. Airlines, however, routinely get big discounts. \nThe airline put the planes into service in May in the US, then between Dallas and Beijing and Buenos Aires in early June. \nThe plane's fuselage and wings are made largely from carbon-fiber composite material instead of aluminum to reduce weight, making the plane more fuel-efficient. \nThis is not the first time that a hail storm left a plane the worse for wear. \nLast month, Delta Air Lines Flight 159 from Detroit to Seoul, South Korea, had its nose cone badly damaged by hail while flying over China, leaving a massive hole in the front. \nThe 26-year-old Boeing 747 has been permanently grounded as a result of the incident.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T22:27:06.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
