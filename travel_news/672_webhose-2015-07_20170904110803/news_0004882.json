Shirley Sinclair Local Real Estate Cars For Sale \nSHE may be wild but she is much better mannered than my pet cattle dog when food is around. \nPatch the Dolphin has popped in with 23-year-old pod alpha male Mystique for the 8am feeding time at the Tin Can Bay Dolphin Centre at Barnacles Cafe. \nMystique has been interacting with Tin Can Bay locals and tourists all his life as a third-generation visitor. \nDolphins have been coming to the cafe for a free feed since the 1950s, when one - nicknamed Old Scarry - beached himself on the sand after reportedly being cut by a boat propeller. \nThe locals and fishermen felt sorry for him and started to feed him as he convalesced in the area. \nOld Scarry eventually returned to the wild but regularly came back to visit and enjoy more easy treats. \nA second dolphin nicknamed Scarry also began visiting and arrived in the bay in 1991, with her calf Mystique. \nScarry has not been seen since 2004, and, for a time, Mystique also took a break from the dolphin centre but returned after a couple of months with Patch, now his 20-something friend. \nA younger member of his pod, Harmony, has also been appearing in recent times to become a fourth-generation visitor.

I follow instructions to take the fish out and hold it still under the water. \nPatch moves forward slowly and, ever so gently and politely, accepts the morsel offered - just like a high-society lady at a high tea would pick up a petit four from a silver platter. \nI'm sure that for the briefest of moments, we make eye contact. \nAnd while the dolphin-to-human encounter may not have left a lasting impression on Patch, she has certainly left one on me. \n*The writer won The Discover Group two-day Fraser Island experience as a quiz prize. \nDOLPHINS AHOY \nTIN Can Bay Wild Dolphin Centre is at Barnacles Café at Norman Point, overlooking Snapper Creek - just over 90minutes drive from Noosa. \nEntry fee is $5 per person, plus $5 for each fish. Proceeds cover fish purchases and other costs. \nThe dolphins arrive between 7-8am daily and the feeding starts at 8am.
