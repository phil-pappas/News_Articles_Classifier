There’s been global interest in this project and we aim to provide a detailed, technical report at the end of the year.”\nSource:- Network Rail\nRelated Posts Expanded Train Services From Decmber 2013 – Scot Rail Network Rail completes £200m festive upgrade programme Energy recovery for metro trains and suburban trains is gathering speed Siemens to realign regional organization and strengthen corporate units Stunning time-lapse film shows the reconstruction of Harcombe Hill bridge in Winterbourne", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T16:20:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
