Moreover, the number of pilgrims overstaying their visas has come down to about 1 percent. The Ministry of Haj has been quoted by the local media as saying that the fall in the number of people overstaying is due to the global electronic system. \"Applications for Umrah visas, arrival and departure of pilgrims and their accommodation in Makkah and Madinah are done in coordination with the Ministries of Interior and Foreign Affairs as well as Umrah companies and their representatives outside Saudi Arabia.\"The Council of Ministers approved last September a number of amendments to the Umrah system and insisted that the Interior Ministry penalize, under article 60 of the residency law, any Umrah company found manipulating Umrah visas for other purposes. The Ministries of Haj and Interior immediately stop the automated system of an Umrah company if it is found guilty.Eisa Mohammad Rawas, undersecretary for umrah affairs, said the amendments included a bank guarantee of SR2 million to be given to the ministry at the time of applying for license.Marwan Shabaan, chairman of the National Haj and Umrah Committee, said the new system guarantees Umrah pilgrims the benefits and does not allow any manipulation. The new system highlights the importance of coordination between the Ministry of Haj and the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage to organize tourist programs and visits to historic sites after the pilgrims perform the Umrah, he said. Shabaan said the Umrah sector is waiting for the issuance of the new executive list. Companies might be given a grace period to rectify their positions according to the new regulations or their licenses could be canceled, he said. Fahad Al-Withyani, an investor in Umrah pilgrims' accommodation, said when the ministry privatized the Umrah system, it was aiming to activate the private sector role in the national economy, provide job opportunities to locals, in addition to raising the standards of services.Mazen Darrar, another investor, said some companies invest to achieve quick profits, but the new system will classify companies serious about their responsibilities.Saad bin Jamil Al-Qurashi, former chairman of the National Haj and Umrah Committee, hopes the new system will safeguard the rights of companies and pilgrims.Investor Talat Tounsi said domestic Haj companies should be given priority because they have more experience in providing services for Umrah pilgrims. This will also enable them to work throughout the year, instead of working only for three months.
