Travelers can experience this creative hotspot with the tour operator members of the United States Tour Operators Association (USTOA) that offer countless opportunities to forge deeper connections to the art and culture of Saxony.\nInterested travelers can find their ideal itinerary by typing Saxony or one of the region’s cities (Dresden, Leipzig, etc.) within the “Find Your Dream Vacation” section of the USTOA homepage. The resulting options provide details on the length of trip, itineraries, dates, and prices for a variety of trips to Saxony.\nSaxony’s diverse blend of traditional and modern arts is now featured in the newest series of experiential travel videos from USTOA in partnership with Saxony Tourism and Avanti Destinations. The videos highlight immersive one-on-one local experiences accessible through USTOA tour operator members, including learning to meticulously paint over the final glaze at the legendary Meissen Porcelain Factory, meeting the musicians at the Gewandhaus in Leipzig, where musicians such as Mozart and Beethoven once premiered pieces, visiting Spinnerai, a groundbreaking art center where artists work, live and sleep, and racing around the track in a sleek, sexy car at Porsche in Leipzig.\nThe videos are the most recent installment in USTOA’s Travel Together campaign, a thoughtfully curated collection of videos and blog posts from bucket list destinations around the globe produced in collaboration with video journalist Kelley Ferro and AFAR Magazine.\nSource:- USTOA\nRelated Posts Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium San francisco travel achieves leed gold certification ITB Berlin: Cross-border cooperation on the Danube Local Taiwanese Life Featured in New Experiential Travel Video Series from USTOA PATA Visitor Arrival Forecasts: Arrivals Well on Track with Forecasts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T01:04:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
