Our new series of posts called Sacred Spaces is an ideal place to make use of a new app called Sphere .\nTake a look at this sphere made in the Church of the Nativity, Episcopal's 1859 sanctuary in downtown Huntsville, Alabama. You can use the tools to scroll around the interior of the church as well as look up at the incredible vaulted ceiling.\nA spherical panorama image is made from a series of photos stitched together allowing you to view the scene not only horizontally but from floor to ceiling as well.
