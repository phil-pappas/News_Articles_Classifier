The custom-built 92,000 sq ft hotel, to be called the Great Scotland Yard Hotel, is to open in early 2017.\nThe glorious Edwardian red brick & stone building was the famed Scotland Yard Police Station , the original home of London’s Metropolitan Police Service which policed most of the city in the 19th century. It was later the British Army’s recruitment center.\nThe iconic building has a colourful history. The police station investigated such crimes as the unsolved serial-killer Jack the Ripper case (1888) and the grisly murder case, Plaistow Marshes (1864). Scotland Yard was celebrated in novels by Charles Dickens and in Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes series. In 1910, when it served as the recruitment office of the British Army and the headquarters of the Royal Military Police, British Secretary of State for War Lord Kitchener, famously exhorted Britain’s potential WW1 recruits, “Your country needs you”. The heritage building was most recently the library of the Ministry of Defence (until 2004).\nIndia’s billionaires are showing an increasing penchant for real estate investments. For instance, Infosys co-founder and former CEO SD Shibulal is an avid property buyer who owns over 700 apartments in the Seattle area as well as hotel properties in India.\nThis is Yusuff Ali’s second investment in London. Last year, he bought a 10% stake in East India Company , the historic trading company which, during the 18th and 19th centuries, led the colonization of India.\nThe seven-storeyed Great Scotland Yard is to have a mix of 235 sumptuous guest rooms, restaurants, library and meeting rooms, all provided with 24/7 concierge service. An adjoining Victorian townhouse is to be incorporated in the hotel to create an entertainment suite.\nThe deal has been signed by Lulu Group’s new hospitality arm, Twenty14 Holdings, which is to focus on acquisition and management of assets around the globe. Twenty14 Holdings, headed by Ali’s son-in-law Adeeb Ahamed, has over $272 million in assets in the Middle East, U.K. and India.\nLuLu Group whose primary play is in hypermarkets, supermarkets and grocery outlets in the Middle East, India and parts of South East Asia, is becoming increasingly active in the hospitality industry. It already runs Hyatt and Marriott Hotels in southern India and a Sheraton Hotel in Oman. Its first hotel in Dubai’s Business Bay is to open later this year.\nThe historic Great Scotland Yard housed the London police service from its inception in 1829 until 1890.
