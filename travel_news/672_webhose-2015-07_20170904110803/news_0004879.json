Some of the management team including Ben Braude and James Clarke will stay on at the firm under the new ownership. \nIn the year to October 31, 2014 Fleetway Travel Ltd reported a 141% rise in pre-tax profit to £2.5m on turnover of £39.8m. \nThe company’s growth is largely down to its use of third-party deals websites such as Travelzoo and Secret Escapes. \nFleetway represents Synova’s first foray into the travel sector. It has previously backed accessories and handbags supplier TLG Brands and insurance broker Stackhouse Poland. \nThe Sunday Times reported that the former chief executive of Saga Holidays, Ian Coghlan would join as executive chairman. \nNeither Synova Capital, nor Fleetway Travel responded to requests for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T12:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T07:17:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
