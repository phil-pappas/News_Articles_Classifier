This advanced digital payment technology is available to more than 56,000 web shops worldwide that route payments through PAY.ON's partners. \"MasterPass offers merchants - on the web, via in-app payments on mobile devices, and, in the future, in stores - a user-friendly solution that simplifies payment for customers by bundling together multiple payment and customer loyalty cards, and minimizing shopping cart abandonment,\" said David Klemm , Head of Acceptance Development Germany at MasterCard. Wolfgang Berner , Senior Vice President Product at PAY.ON, said: \"We are pleased to further build upon our close partnership with MasterCard. With MasterPass, merchants and shoppers have a multifunctional payment method that allows for centralized and secure use of all available online payment methods. This sets a new standard for digital wallets, or eWallets.\" MasterPass simplifies payment processes When shoppers have to repeatedly enter account details and address information, it leads to higher rates of shopping cart abandonment. The continuing trend toward shopping on mobile devices therefore requires innovative, customer and merchant-friendly payment solutions. With MasterPass, MasterCard is focused on the consumer desire for a fast, secure and simple payment option. MasterPass combines several technologies for the first time, creating a digital wallet that stores payment and shipping information in a highly secure data center at the issuing bank, and then automatically transmits cardholder information to the merchant during the payment process. Payment is therefore reduced to a few clicks, and due to the connection with the bank's internal systems, is quicker, easier to use, and more secure. Unlike some competing products, MasterPass is not a niche solution, but rather aims to make digital wallet payments ubiquitous for users. Merchants who implement MasterPass have a significant opportunity to improve customer retention. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T13:06:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
