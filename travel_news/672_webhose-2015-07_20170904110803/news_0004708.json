Dr Peter Fisher, who is also Clinical Director and Director of Research at the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine, said that homeopathy was ‘safe’, ‘popular with patients’ and reduced the need for antibiotics. Writing in the British Medical Journal Dr Fisher said that alternative therapies were often ‘misunderstood’ and questioned research which suggested they only work through a placebo effect. “The fact that one homeopathic treatment for a condition is ineffective doesn’t mean that another is also ineffective,” he said. He also pointed to several studies that showed integrating homeopathy with conventional medicines led to better patient outcomes and the reduced use of potentially hazardous drugs. “Doctors should put aside bias based on the alleged implausibility of homeopathy. When integrated with standard care homeopathy is safe, popular with patients, improves clinical outcomes without increasing costs, and reduces the use of potentially hazardous drugs, including antimicrobials. “Health professionals trained in homeopathy do not oppose the use of conventional treatments, including immunisation.” Supporters claim that homeopathy can treat everything from depression to hay fever, the theory being that substances that produce the symptoms of an ailment can cure it once they have been watered down many times to reduce their strength. Advocates of the practice claim the water retains a “memory” of the original substance. But although it has prominent supporters including the Prince of Wales, and Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, NHS trusts have largely stopped funding treatments, with prescriptions falling by 94 per cent in the last 20 years. The government’s Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies has branded alternative medicine as ‘rubbish.’ In 2010 the British Medical Association passed a motion denouncing the use of the alternative medicine, saying taxpayers should not foot the bill for remedies with no scientific basis to support them. The BMA’s junior doctor’s committee went further, likening homeopathy to witchcraft and saying it was a disgrace that it was still being funded by the NHS. Refuting Dr Fisher’s comments in the BMJ, Edzard Ernst, Emeritus Professor at the University of Exeter, said the assumptions underlying homeopathy “fly in the face of science.” And warned that it could be deadly if replacing an effective therapy. “Several deaths that have occurred in this unnecessary way,” he added. “Homeopathy’s mode of action has no rational explanation.” “The axioms of homeopathy are implausible, it’s benefits do not outweigh its risks, and its costs and opportunity costs are considerable. “Therefore, it seems unreasonable, even unethical, for healthcare professionals to recommend its use.” The Royal Family has supported homeopathy for generations and there is still a court homeopath. In 1993, the Prince of Wales set up the Foundation for Integrated Health, a charity that lobbied for homeopathy to be considered alongside mainstream medicine in hospitals. It argued that embracing such treatments would benefit patients and save money, cutting prescription drugs bills by up to 50 per cent. But in 2010, the charity closed, later admitting that allegations of fraud and the arrest of a former official were to blame, and reopened that same year under the banner of the College of Medicine. Dr Fisher and Prof Ernst were writing in the British Medical Journal.
