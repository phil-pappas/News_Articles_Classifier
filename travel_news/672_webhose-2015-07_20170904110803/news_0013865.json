Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts second-quarter 2015 earnings call. Before we begin I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA and comparable hotel results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC and on our Web site at hosthotels.com. With me on the call today is Ed Walter, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning Ed will provide a brief overview of our second-quarter results and then will describe the current operating environment as well as the Company's outlook for 2015. Greg will then provide greater detail on our second-quarter performance by market. Following their remarks we will be available to respond to your questions. And now here is Ed. Ed Walter (President, CEO): Thanks, Gee, good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of positive results for the Company driven by strong rate growth and solid group demand. We are also quite pleased with our progress on various transactions and value creation opportunities throughout our portfolio. First, let's review our results for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $422 million for the quarter and $743 million year to date, reflecting a year-to-date increase of 3.3%. Our adjusted FFO was $0.46 per share for the second quarter and $0.81 per share year to date, reflecting a 6.6% increase over last year. Both earning measures are in line with the consensus. These results were driven by several factors. First, RevPAR for our comparable domestic portfolio increased by 5.3% which matched upper upscale industry performance despite continuing drag from ongoing renovations at a number of hotels. While Greg will provide more detailed insight shortly, we were pleased to see that overall, with the exception of Houston and New York, our portfolio performed in line or better than we had expected for the quarter. This strong domestic performance was driven by our group segment which benefited from a 13% increase in association business leading to group demand growth of 2.7% and rate growth of 4.4%, which translated to group revenue growth of more than 7%. Our transient segment benefited from mix shift as our top-rated segments, which represent slightly less than half of our overall transient business, improved demand by more than 2%. Planned reductions in our lower-priced segments resulted in a modest transient demand decline, but overall rate was up 4.9% and our transient revenues increased by more than 4%. Within the quarter for our domestic hotels June was our strongest month as April was affected by renovation impacts (technical difficulty) suffered from difficult prior year comparisons. Our group revenue growth outpaced transient growth each month, although, because of successful rate mix strategies, our transient rate growth was stronger in all months except May. Evaluated on a constant currency basis our international portfolio performed well, selling 9% in the quarter when we exclude the Calgary Marriott, which was undergoing a very destructive room renovation, and the JW in Rio which benefited significantly from the World Cup last year. Excluding those hotels group room demand increased nearly 9% while transient rates rose solidly. When all of our comparable international hotels are included we had a constant currency RevPAR decline of 5.9% for the quarter. 1 of 14", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T00:34:19.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
