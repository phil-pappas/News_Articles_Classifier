In practice, this means dark corridors, going from one high-octane narrator to another, with some techie bells and whistles. In theory, it suits children aged six and over, but I can’t imagine a 10-year-old getting much out of it.\nFun fact\nCounty Hall used to be a monument to civic meaning. Ha! Now it’s full of adults in dressing-up clothes.\nBest thing about it?\nThe 4D bus tour – it’s amazing but getting to it involves a huge amount of preamble, involving actors doing comic turns and imparting instructions. It is a virtual tour of central London and all the major Dreamworks films, complete with realistic rocking and splashes – I screamed out loud.\nWhat about lunch?\nIt’s right on the South Bank, so head towards the Festival Hall, where there are plenty of reputable chains.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The How to Train Your Dragon experience at Shrek’s Adventure Exit through the gift shop?\nWorse: even before reaching the shop, there is an “opportunity” to purchase a £25 photo album of your children, in Shrek and other tableaux.\nGetting there\nExtremely easy, five minutes’ walk from Waterloo station and tube; also riverboat options.\nValue for money?\nMoot point. Advance tickets are £23.40 for adults and £18.72 for kids (10% more on the door), and it lasts 90 minutes. But some bits are unforgettable. Against comparable attractions – the London Eye lasts 30 minutes and costs almost as much – it fares OK. But, in terms of the actual world, it seems a lot.\nOpening times\n10am to 6pm, seven days a week ( shreksadventure.com ).\nVerdict\n6/10. The 4D bit is mind-blowing, the buildup and comedown a bit lame. So I guess it all depends on how much you like 4D.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Take+the+kids+to+%E2%80%A6+Shrek%E2%80%99s+Adventure%2C+London&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4abc6%2Fstw%23img-2", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4abc6%2Fsfb%23img-2&ref=responsive", "https://www.shreksadventure.com/london/", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Take+the+kids+to+%E2%80%A6+Shrek%E2%80%99s+Adventure%2C+London&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Fjul%2F07%2Fshreks-adventure-london-review&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F7%2F6%2F1436196459460%2F6aa5a173-9350-4d48-80b6-ab299705c3c1-1020x679.jpeg"], "published": "2015-07-07T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T17:31:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
