But according to a new survey of 2,300 travelers from FlightView, a provider of airline and airport data, travelers are increasingly wary of booking trips to their desired destination that involve connecting flights. Both Chicago-based United (NYSE: UAL) and American (NASDAQ: AAL) operate major hub and spoke operations at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport that involve flying thousands of passengers from their departure city to their final destination, usually by connecting to a different flight through O'Hare. And even Southwest (NYSE: LUV), which early in its history was almost exclusively a point-to-point carrier, has essentially turned Chicago's Midway Airport into a huge hub through which many of the carrier's passengers must change planes to get to their final destination. Southwest is the dominant carrier at Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport. Baltimore passengers are likely well acquainted with the airports in Charlotte, a hub for US Airways, and Atlanta, a hub for Delta Air Lines. But it now appears a lot of flyers no longer want the aggravation — and most importantly the uncertainty — that comes with having to make flight connections, or to a lesser degree, even make an intermediate stop before continuing on to where they want to go. And many passengers would be willing to pay more to avoid the hassle altogether. According to FlightView, a whopping 70 percent of travelers surveyed said they'd be willing to pay a higher fare for a nonstop flight. Of that 70 percent, more than two-thirds of respondents said they be willing to pay fares that are 10 to 15 percent higher, and another one-third of respondents said they would even pay another 16 percent more on top of that to get a nonstop flight. What's more, the FlightView data also shows more travelers now are willing to drive further — perhaps bypassing their local airports and the economic impact they stand to gain — to book nonstop flights from more distant airports. Nearly 60 percent of travelers surveyed said they be willing to driver father for access to nonstop flights. And of that group, more than 25 percent said they would be willing to drive at least two hours — a statistic that surely suggests airline trips involving connections are losing significant appeal. But though travelers appear fed up with connections, the fact is the dynamics of the airline business have changed dramatically in the past decade. The airline industry no longer is about the customers first and foremost. Bottom line, it's about what makes money for the airlines and airports. And as service to many midsized and smaller airports that aren't hubs has been drastically cut or eliminated altogether in recent years, the hub and spoke system has only become more ingrained in the airline industry As the FlightView survey notes, if airlines do decide to add nonstop service between two cities, \"the decision comes down to whether or not the new market will be profitable and deliver revenues that were previously unavailable to the airlines or airport.\" Remember, this is finally about the airlines and their economic well-being. Not about you. \nWant Baltimore Travel   Bizspace Spotlight", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T15:21:26.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
