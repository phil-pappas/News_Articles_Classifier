As the keel – the bottom-most part of the ship – was ceremoniously lowered into position, shipyard officials celebrated the occasion with a traditional Chinese lion dance. This yet to be named ship will be customized to appeal to the China market when it makes a very memorable debut in summer 2017. \nAnthony Kaufman, Senior Vice President, Asia Operations, Princess Cruises (left); Attilio Dapelo, Fincantieri Shipyard Director (Middle) and Cherry Wang, Country Director, Carnival China (right) attend the official keel laying ceremony at the Fincantieri \nFollowing the lion dance and a traditional blessing by a priest, the ship’s keel – which weighs approximately 500 tons – was moved into position by crane onto the keel blocks. The computer-guided maneuver took only minutes, belying the more than two million man-hours that will ultimately go into building the vessel. The 3,600-passenger, 141,000-ton ship will remain in the building dock until its float-out next summer. \n“We are incredibly excited to mark this step in a ship’s construction and we are very pleased to work with our long-term partner, Fincantieri on our newest ship. We appreciate their partnership and collaboration to customize and tailor the ship for the Chinese market” said Anthony Kaufman, Princess Cruises’ senior vice president of Asia operations who traveled to Italy for the ceremony. \n“The lion dance has been part of the Chinese culture for thousands of years and is performed on various auspicious occasions and celebrations. According to traditional Chinese belief, the lion signifies courage, wisdom, and good fortune and brings happiness, longevity, and good luck. We believe this special ceremony will bring prosperity and good fortune to Princess Cruises and our guests in China” said Cherry Wang, country director of Carnival China, who also traveled to Italy for the ceremony. \nThe new Royal Class ship will offer many of the same special features as Royal Princess/ Regal Princess, which have been so well-received by the industry. These include a dramatic multi-story atrium serving as the social hub of the ship; an over-the-ocean SeaWalk, a top-deck glass-bottomed walkway extending 28 feet beyond the edge of the ship; the Princess Live! interactive studio; a special Chef’s Table Lumiere, a private dining experience that surrounds diners in a curtain of light. \nGuests will enjoy international cuisine of all different regions with Princess, including China, Japan, Southeast Asia, Italy, France, North America and others.; as well as an array of international festivals re-created to celebrate cultures around the world; Princess Watercolor Fantasy, a fountain and music show; Movies Under the Stars featuring the largest outdoor screen at sea; and balconies on all outside staterooms. Accommodations will be configured to appeal to families and multi-generational travelers. \nIn addition, the new ship will showcase the exclusive Princess Class experience designed specifically for the Chinese market. Delivered by the ship’s dedicated and caring crew, Princess Class enriches the travel experience of each cruise guest, enabling them to participate in unique cultural, culinary, entertaining and inspiring programs including the World Leaders Dinner, traditional English afternoon tea, a Lobster Grill, Ultimate Balcony Dining, an ocean-view hot pot dinner option, ballroom dancing, and an unparalleled duty-free shopping experience. \nAdditional details about the new ship’s features and deployment schedule will be announced over the coming months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T06:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T09:38:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
