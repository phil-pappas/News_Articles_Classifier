Sign up for the free e-course > Staying well on the road is a concern for travelers of all ages, even more so when you have children. Careful planning is necessary to be sure that your child will remain healthy as you travel and to be sure that you are well equipped to deal with any medical emergencies that may arise.\nThere will be a big difference in the amount, and type, of preparation, depending on the length of your trip and where you are planning to go. A two-week vacation to a resort is an entirely different thing than setting out for six months or a year to live in a foreign place. \nThere is no way for us to cover every contingency; instead, we’ll point you to some good resources and paint some broad brush strokes to get you thinking and planning in the right direction. \nIn general, there are three areas of health care that need to be considered when embarking on a trip with travelers of any age. These are: maintenance health care, destination specific risks and emergency health care. Let’s look at these one by one, as each relates to your child. Maintenance health care We all know children require a lot of physical care and a lot of healthcare oversight in their first years. Most of us schedule regular doctor visits to monitor the growth and development of our children and to be sure that they are reaching developmental milestones appropriately. Most of us also follow an immunization schedule during the early years to be sure our children are protected from life threatening diseases like Polio, Diptheria, Tetanus, Hepatitis, and others. “Maintenance health care is important for any child, but for a child who travels extensively, it’s even more important, as your child will be exposed to foods, bacteria, and possibly viruses or other organisms a baby remaining at home would not.” If you plan to travel at any point in your child’s life, it is very important to familiarize yourself with the immunization schedule and to schedule the appropriate check-ups along the way. If you carry a record of your child’s immunization dates, any doctor in any clinic can review what has already been administered and continue with regular treatment.\nIf you are traveling for any length of time, it is an excellent practice to carry a copy of your child’s medical records with you. Maintenance health care is important for any child, but for a child who travels extensively, it’s even more important, as your child will be exposed to foods, bacteria, and possibly viruses or other organisms a baby remaining at home would not. This is not necessarily a bad thing, it’s just an additional aspect of the reality of parenting on the road that needs to be weighed carefully and wisely managed. Destination specific risks We were amused, recently, to realize that our youngest child thinks typhoid and yellow fever vaccinations are part of the usual childhood roundup of shots. For our family, they were. Before we set off to cycle two continents and backpack part of a third, there was (and continues to be) much research on the destination specific risks of the places we intend to visit.\nEven seemingly innocuous locations, like the southern coast of Italy, during certain years, are home to typhoid outbreaks–and you’re not going to want to get anywhere close to the equator without a yellow fever shot. Our kids moan loudly about the bitter anti-malaria pills that we dole out every Sunday morning when we’re in Central America, but not taking them is simply not an option for us. “It is imperative that you are well researched and well informed as to the increased risks of disease exposure as it relates to your specific destinations, and make your health related decisions carefully.” I know there are lots of folks who travel without getting the shots, or taking the bitter pills, and there are arguments on both sides of the issue. It is imperative that you are well researched and well informed as to the increased risks of disease exposure as it relates to your specific destinations, and make your health related decisions carefully.\nNot every health care risk can be reduced. Not every disease can be immunized for (dengue, for example). But many can, and those immunizations that are available should be carefully considered, as sometimes there is not a second chance. The CDC website has a thorough list of recommended immunizations and precautions to be taken, by country and region. Do your homework and give yourself enough time to allow the doses to become effective in your system before heading out. Food and Water The food and water in some places of the world can pose a health risk in the form of parasites or bacteria that result in intestinal difficulties. A child who is affected by one of these organisms is at an especially high health risk, as life-threatening dehydration happens quickly in small children.\nUse only bottled water in preparing your child’s food and thoroughly disinfect all fruits and vegetables using iodine tablets, grapefruit seed crush extract (GSE), or bleach water before feeding them to your child. \nAdhere strictly to the bleach-boil-peel rule (only eat it if you have bleached it, boiled it or peeled it) and you’ll minimize the risks significantly. For our family, I bleach even if we’re going to peel, as bacteria on the peel can be transferred to the inside of the fruit on the knife you’re using. “Adhere strictly to the bleach-boil-peel rule (only eat it if you have bleached it, boiled it or peeled it) and you’ll minimize the risks significantly. “ To use bleach as a disinfectant for fresh fruits and veggies, simply soak the produce in a solution of bleach (1 Tbsp) and water (1 qt./L) for twenty minutes, rinse with purified water and then prepare as you normally would.\nTo use GSE as a disinfectant , use 15 drops of extract per quart of water and soak the veggies for twenty minutes, rinse with purified water, and prepare as you normally would. GSE can also be taken internally (5 drops to a glass of water) to cut down on intestinal difficulties while traveling. Emergency health care No matter how careful you are, how prepared you are, or how well immunized you are, eventually you’re going to have a health care emergency with your child. This is equally true whether you travel or stay home.\nWhen traveling with a child, it is especially important to be prepared for these emergencies, to minimize the trauma and the potential health consequences for everyone. While you can’t predict when an emergency will strike, or how bad it will be, there are a few things you can do to prepare: Carry the appropriate documents: medical and immunization records, lists of allergies to foods, medicines and environmental factors, lists of medications, and vitamins currently being taken. Take the appropriate classes: There is no excuse for not being first aid and CPR certified. Our children take the classes by ten years-old, and we review periodically. No parent should be without these skills. Do your homework: Make it your first priority to locate the nearest medical center or hospital when you arrive in a new area. Private hospitals are your best bet in 3rd world countries. Carry a medical kit: I’m not talking about the $20 basic first aid kit available at the drug store, I’m talking about a REAL medical kit (more on that below). \nThe necessity of this was driven home for us on an idyllic tropical evening, camped on the side of a volcano in a little town in the highlands of Guatemala when our middle son, Elisha, who was nine at the time, cut the tip of his finger almost completely off whilst working on some fish. \nIt was our first experience with a third world hospital. It was not confidence inspiring. There was no suture kit in the entire “hospital,” nor were there butterfly bandages. In the end, what I had in my health kit was better than what the doctors could provide. \nThey did, however, hook us up with an unidentifiable pain medication: “23 drops every three hours” and an antibiotic to ward off infection. What did I learn? That I needed to add a suture kit to the bag. Ready to plan a family trip around the world? What should you have in your medical bag?
