Issued on the spot \nIf applying in person, visas can usually be issued on the spot, often within an hour and usually without need of a return visit. \nAllow a few days for Australian visa applications by post and add the usual time it takes mail to reach the visa centre and return to you. \nThere may or may not be a charge for a tourist visa or ETA valid for one year, with multiple entries and up to three months' stay in Australia, but it's best to check with an Australian consulate near you. \nWith current security concerns, there may be changes in the requirements or process of getting an Australian visa.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T14:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T19:37:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
