But “going global” is not easy. Mainland enterprises needed to learn about foreign markets, do risk assessments, and come up with an investment strategy, he said. To do this they needed legal and professional assistance, which “is where Hong Kong’s world-class service providers come in”. Hong Kong is an international business centre with top organisations in law, accounting and consultancy that all have extensive experience in cross-border deals and have a deep understanding of mainland corporate culture, he said. The council has been helping mainland companies in overseas investments since 2011, having organised several “investment tours” for entrepreneurs to Europe, the United States and Canada. One enterprise that took part in a tour in 2013 was Wu Xin Precision Machinery Manufacturing in Dongguan, southern Guangdong province, which later went on to sign an agreement with a Canadian company to launch a joint venture in Dongguan making machines that turn plastic waste into eco-friendly oil. That deal was signed in Hong Kong, while Winston & Strawn, a local law firm that had sent delegates on the same tour, represented Wu Xin Precision. Timothy Li, a partner at law firm Sidley Austin, said he had joined mainland businesspeople on an overseas investment tour in 2013 to New York, Los Angeles and Toronto. He said he offered legal advice, and helped executives to better understand the Western legal systems and the potential risks involved in acquisitions. “Mainland companies prefer to hire Hong Kong intermediaries because we have a deeper understanding of Chinese culture, as well as rich experience in cross-border M&A deals,” Mr Li said. “We also have nguistic advantages, as the majority of experts in Hong Kong speak Chinese and English, which is useful in business negotiations.” Some private companies wanted to only hire a translator for overseas business negotiations, but found that an interpreter was far from enough Ronnie Choi, senior partner at Choi, Lo & Co, an accounting firm that also took part in a mission organised by the council, said some mainland private companies had originally wanted to only hire a translator for overseas business negotiations, but when they met with potential acquisition targets they found that a mere interpreter was far from enough. “A translator can’t offer views on how they should acquire an asset, whether it’s a takeover, a share-purchasing deal or just securing the licence to manufacture a product on the mainland,” he said. “That’s why mainland companies find us helpful.” In 2013, a Guangdong company discovered new materials at a research lab in the United States during a tour. Choi said he helped the company secure exclusive purchasing rights for the material and manufacture a new product for the China market. The company now plans to expand overseas, including building a factory in the US. According to the council, 212 mainland companies have participated in its tours, meeting more than 1,700 potential acquisition targets overseas, with more than 200 preliminary acquisition agreements sealed. A total of 78 Hong Kong companies also sent employees to help executives identify potential acquisition targets. The council recently surveyed more than 200 companies in the Yangtze River Delta and found that most believe Hong Kong can provide a full range of professional services to help them go overseas and increase foreign investments while helping to lower the risks. Mr Yip said experts in consulting, law and accountancy are in large demand, and that mainland enterprises seeking overseas investment opportunities are relying on Hong Kong experts to provide due diligence and compliance services. Most private mainland companies want to acquire retail brands, licences, technology and new sales channels in other countries, he said.
