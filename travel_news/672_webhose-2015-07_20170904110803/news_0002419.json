The inaugural event will be held with the support of the Kenya Investment Authority from November 2 to 4, 2016 at the Kenyatta International Conference Center in Kenya’s capital Nairobi. The African continent continues to experience intensive construction activity and investment by value of mega projects under construction grew by 46.2 per cent in 2014, touching USD 326 billion from USD 222 billion in 2013. \nWith significant development in the sectors such as oil and gas and retail, total value of projects in East Africa reached USD 61 billion in 2014. It is estimated that an investment between USD 60 to 70 billion is required for infrastructure development in the oil and gas sector alone. Backed by ample government support and strong economic fundamentals, East Africa is poised to develop into a flourishing market for construction in the next few years. The new show will be a central meeting point for regional buyers of construction products to interact with global distributors and manufacturers. Andy White, VP Construction - dmg events - Middle East & Asia, said: “The Big 5 brand has grown rapidly in recent years from its established home in Dubai and now takes place in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, India and Indonesia. Our exhibitors are constantly looking for new markets and The Big 5 helps them reach the right buyers in markets where construction is booming. East Africa is an exciting market, with plenty of opportunities and one which is of real interest for our international and GCC clients.” The Big 5 Construct East Africa will give international suppliers and manufacturers direct access to thousands of architects, interior designers, engineers, contractors, and real estate developers actively seeking new and innovative construction products. Alongside a comprehensive exhibition, the event will also feature free-to-attend technical seminars, certified workshops and training programs including ‘How to Trade in East Africa,’ high-level strategic conferences, live product demonstrations, and business matching for manufacturers and local distributors. “The Big 5 Construct East Africa is the first of a number of events we plan to organize in this expanding market. We feel that the region is currently thriving with opportunities and the timing is perfect to launch a forum that brings in significant value to both local and international businesses. Our long-time expertise in facilitating business between global suppliers and local buyers together with the support of the Kenya Investment Authority will give inaugural event a major boost. We are upbeat that The Big 5 Construct East Africa will be highly successful in providing an exceptional platform to do business, network and learn from business leaders,” concluded Simon Mellor, President – Middle East and Asia, dmg events.
