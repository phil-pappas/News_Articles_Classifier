The 36-year-old stud farmer’s good looks and country charm drew plenty of interest from single ladies looking to apply. But last Thursday production company Fremantle Media called him to say he would no longer get his shot at finding love on screen, as they made way for Married At First Sight star Lachlan McAleer.\nCapitalising on viewer interest in Lachlan, who revealed on ACA last week that his TV marriage with ‘wife’ Clare hadn’t worked out, Nine rushed the higher-profile bachelor into the mix for Farmer Wants A Wife .\nScott admitted he was embarrassed by Nine’s “disappointing” decision to replace him at the death. “I thought I’d let all my friends and family down,” he told Fairfax Media .\nSingle father-of-two Scott Mitchell was dumped from Farmer Wants A Wife at the last minute.

Agricultural newspaper The Land reports Scott has been inundated on social media by messages from single women, with numerous Facebook friend requests.\nThe AFL enthusiast even has his first paid modelling gig at a bridal fair in Albury this weekend.\nFarmer Scott.
