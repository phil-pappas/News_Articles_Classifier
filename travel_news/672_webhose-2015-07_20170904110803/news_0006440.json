I was pleading with her to let me use the toilet and I was crying my eyes out because I was in so much pain.\n“But she just carried on stacking the shelves like I wasn’t even there.\n“Normally I carry my card with me, but I was in such a rush to use the toilet that I left my bag in my car.\n“When I went back outside to get it, I just couldn’t hold it in any longer.”\nAnnie Richards, 24, pictured with her 'Can't Wait' card. Source: Picture Media\nThe full-time mum to Cory, five, was diagnosed with Crohn’s six years ago and takes up to 30 tablets a day to combat the effects, which include extreme fatigue and bloody stools.\nLast April she underwent an operation to remove almost 4 metres of her small intestine.\nShe struggles to eat solid foods and exists mainly on a diet of jelly and liquids, which has seen her drop 25 kilograms over the last two years.\nAnnie said: “Even a mouthful of food has me rushing to the toilet. It’s unbearable.\n“The thing with Crohn’s is that it’s an invisible illness. To anyone else, I look like a normal girl. But it’s left me unable to work and sometimes it’s difficult to even get out of bed.\n“I rarely go out, which is why it was devastating to be treated so cruelly by the Co-op. I’d had a lovely weekend, and it really knocked my confidence.\n“Now I’m worried to even go out in case I have another accident.”\nThe Plymouth branch of the Co-operative Food supermarket where Crohn's sufferer Annie Richards was turned away.

I feel like much more needs to be done to educate people on the effects of Crohn’s.\n“Whilst I can accept that it might not be store policy to allow members of the public to use staff toilets, I would hope that people would use their common sense.\n“I was clearly in a lot of pain, and as someone who used to work in a supermarket, I know I would never treat someone in that way.\n“People need to understand that we’re not exaggerating when we say we need the toilet. Hopefully companies will also teach their staff about the ‘Can’t Wait’ cards so they can respond more appropriately in the future.”\nAnnie Richards at home.

I want to help other people with the condition to know that they are not alone and there is nothing to be ashamed of.”\nCaroline Reed, Membership Manager at Crohn’s and Colitis UK, said: “Whilst we cannot comment specifically on this incident, we do know that for many people with inflammatory bowel disease, the sudden and uncontrollable need to use a toilet is a genuine and recognised symptom of their condition.\n“Having an ‘accident’ in public can have a devastating effect on their ability to undertake everyday activities, such as going to work, shopping and socialising.\n“We hope that in the future staff members will be more sensitive to members of the public with ‘invisible’ diseases.”\nCrohn's sufferer Annie Richards before her operation.
