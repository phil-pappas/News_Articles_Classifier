Everything but the kitchen sink! Jaw-dropping photos show... Dramatic POV footage captures passengers' panic then relief... The animal kingdom as you've never seen it before:... 11 shares Most men said they had taken pictures ‘because I appreciated their beauty and wanted to remember it’ (51 per cent) while a further 32 per cent wanted to show their mates back home.\nEven though they were OK with photographing a stranger, most men said they would have felt less than happy to know their own wife or girlfriend was being surreptitiously photographed by a man.\nThree-quarters said they would be ‘furious’, with only 11 per cent claiming they would feel ‘proud’.\nHalf of those who snapped a photo were in a relationship and most were on holiday with their partner\nChris Clarkson, managing director of sunshine.co.uk, said: ‘There's no denying that these findings are really alarming.\n‘Women should be able to relax on holiday and not have to have their wits about them 100 per cent of the time. Men have no right to photograph scantily-clad women that they do not know in secret. It's very wrong.\n‘When we asked how men would feel if it was their wife or girlfriend in front of the camera, we found that most of them would quite rightly be furious.\n‘It made us realise that a few of those men must be very hypocritical, given that some were also guilty of photographing women in secret.’", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1eDeW2c"], "published": "2015-07-31T00:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T22:02:11.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
