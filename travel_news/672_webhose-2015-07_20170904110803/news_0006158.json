Passenger unit revenues declined 4.6% on a 3.9% decline in yields. \nDelta saw solid progress with several of its revenue initiatives, including Branded Fares, which increased passenger revenues by $56 million, and its enhanced agreement with American Express, which produced an incremental $60 million in revenue. \n\"Our commercial initiatives continue to gain traction in the marketplace and we will produce summer margins in excess of any achieved in our history,\" said Ed Bastian, Delta's president. \"However, unit revenue growth is an important component of our long-term plan to expand margins. We continue to project flat system capacity growth for the fourth quarter of 2015 – a level in line with current demand expectations, which should put the business on the right trajectory to stem the erosion in unit revenues by the end of the year.\" Increase (Decrease) Passenger Revenue 2Q15 ($M) YoY Revenue Yield Capacity Domestic 4,713 4.9 % (1.1) % (1.0) % 6.0 % Atlantic 1,551 (6.9) % (11.5) % (6.5) % 5.1 % Pacific 722 (11.8) % (8.5) % (10.6) % (3.7) % Latin America 601 (0.5) % (7.8) % (6.8) % 7.9 % Total mainline 7,587 0.1 % (4.4) % (3.4) % 4.7 % Regional 1,552 (7.8) % (1.6) % (2.8) % (6.4) % Consolidated 9,139 (1.4) % (4.6) % (3.9) % 3.4 % Cargo Revenue 207 (10.0) % Total Revenue 10,707 0.8 % \nInvestment Strengthens Partnership and Expands Global Reach \nStrengthening its existing partnership with GOL, Delta recently agreed to purchase up to $56 million in preferred shares as part of a larger rights offering by the Brazilian carrier. In addition to the equity, Delta will guarantee up to $300 million in borrowings by GOL under a term loan with third-party lenders. Delta's guarantee will be secured by GOL's interest in SMILES, GOL's publicly-traded loyalty program. Delta and GOL have also agreed to extend their exclusive commercial agreement for flights between the United States and Brazil, the largest aviation market in Latin America. This transaction is subject to normal closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. \nCost Performance \nAdjusted fuel expense2 declined over $463 million compared to the same period in 2014, as 39% lower market fuel prices and a $77 million increase in profit at the refinery offset nearly $600 million in settled hedge losses. For the remainder of 2015, Delta expects its fuel expense to be $1.90 – $2.00 per gallon, a significant reduction to the $2.65 per gallon it realized in the first six months of the year. \nCASM-Ex3 decreased 0.8% for the June quarter on a year-over-year basis, with foreign exchange and the benefits of Delta's domestic refleeting and other cost initiatives offsetting the company's investments in its employees, products and operations. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter of CASM growth below 2%, in line with the company's long-term goals. \nDelta's debt reduction initiative continued to improve the company's interest expense, producing $46 million in interest savings for the quarter compared to the same period in 2014. \n\"Because of the momentum we've built with our cost reduction initiatives, we expect to post our ninth consecutive quarter of sub-2% unit cost growth in September,\" said Paul Jacobson, Delta's chief financial officer. \"Cost efficiency has contributed to the record results that allowed us to return $1 billion to shareholders in the June quarter while investing in our employees and customer experience.\" \nCash Flow, Shareholder Returns, and Adjusted Net Debt \nDelta generated $2.5 billion of adjusted operating cash flow and $1.6 billion of free cash flow during the quarter. The company used this strong cash generation to reinvest nearly $1 billion back into the business, primarily for aircraft purchases. The company returned $1.0 billion to its owners through $72 million of dividends and $925 million of share repurchases, while also strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its adjusted net debt to $7.1 billion. \nSeptember 2015 Quarter Guidance \nFollowing are Delta's projections for the September 2015 quarter: \n3Q15 Forecast Unit Revenue (compared to 3Q14) (4.5%) - (6.5%) Operating margin 19% - 21% Fuel price, including taxes, settled hedges and refinery impact $1.90-$1.95 CASM - Ex (compared to 3Q14) Flat System capacity (compared to 3Q14) ~3% GAAP Metrics Related to Fuel, Cost Performance and Cash Flow Below are GAAP metrics corresponding to the non-GAAP figures cited above.
