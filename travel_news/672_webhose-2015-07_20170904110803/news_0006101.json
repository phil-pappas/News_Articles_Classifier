Until as recently as 1995, each of the three the vaulted chambers that made up my fresh, white washed room were separate cells of Her Majesty's Prison, Oxford. \nToday, the splendid décor manages to be modern, plush and Medieval (in spirit at any rate) at the same time, It evokes an even earlier period when this was a thousand year old castle. Frette linens spread across dark wooden beds dressed with plump feather pillows and deep russet, black and wine velvet coverings. Votive candles flicker in the guest rooms and the dramatically lit public areas. Deeply upholstered, high backed chairs, tartan carpets and the crests and banners of the Oxford colleges add to the baronial ambiance. \nThe Brasserie , lodged in the former solitary confinement wing, serves modern English and European food (using slabs of black slate for plates). The menu changes regularly but you might find seared Scottish West Coast scallops or breast of chicken with barley, chestnut and sage risotto. Open for lunch, dinner and Sunday brunch -- the restaurant has good value, two or three course Prix Fixe menus and a well chosen wine list. \nThe bar is open from 11a.m. to 11p.m. and in the Visitor's Room (formerly the prison visits room, with a gallery for the guards)you can take afternoon tea, a beer or a game of billiards. \nOnly two quibbles: At £12.95, the full English breakfast costs as much as the early, two-course, Prix Fixe dinner menu. There is no pool and the gym rooms are small and gloomy. We wondered why they didn't cover the prison exercise yard to create better facilities. \nQuibbles aside though, I'd be happy to do a stretch any time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:32:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
