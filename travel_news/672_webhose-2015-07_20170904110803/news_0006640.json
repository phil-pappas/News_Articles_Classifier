CLARY/AFP/Getty Images \nIt's truly the end of an era. \nFAO Schwarz , beloved toy store and iconic fixture in New York City history will officially close the doors of its flagship store on July 15. \nSince its opening in 1862, the vast toy wonderland has attracted visitors from all over the world, and while it may have lost customers over the years ( Toys'R'Us acquired the struggling store to prevent from closing in 2009,) it always seemed to maintain its magic, thanks in part to 1988's \"Big.\" Fan of the movie or not, chances are you know about the famous piano scene, which features Tom Hanks and Robert Loggia breaking out into a rendition of \"Heart and Soul\" and \"Chopsticks,\" much to the amusements of the store's onlookers: \n\nOverpriced and over the top, the store hit that sweet spot between offering toys you'd find in regular toy stores, and also six-foot-tall stuffed giraffes. For native New Yorkers and tourists alike, FAO Schwarz was a staple in any trip to midtown Manhattan. \nBut even if you haven't stepped foot inside the store in years there was always something comforting about knowing it was still there. The notion that if and when you felt so inclined, you could whisk through the revolving doors, past the costumed guards and into what truly was another world was comforting. \nToys'R'Us has stated the store will find a new home in Manhattan , but if you ask us, nothing will ever be quite like the original. \nExcuse us while we play that scene on repeat for the rest of the day. \nAlso on HuffPost Travel:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T20:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T20:30:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
