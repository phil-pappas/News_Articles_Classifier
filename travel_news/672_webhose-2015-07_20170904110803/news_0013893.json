The case has been in the court system for the better part of a decade. It is unclear how the ruling applies to later years.\nNon-profit hospitals have changed a lot since their origins as “charitable alms houses providing free basic medical treatment to the infirm poor,” he said, likening Morristown’s business model to that of its “new for-profit competitors.” Eight hospitals statewide currently are owned by for-profit companies, with two more due to be acquired at the end of this month. These investor-owned facilities pay taxes, unless they negotiate tax abatements with local authorities.\nLike the for-profits, “today’s non-profit hospitals have evolved into labyrinthine corporate structures, intertwined with both non-profit and for-profit subsidiaries and unaffiliated corporate entities,” Bianco wrote. They “generate significant revenue and pay their professionals salaries that are competitive even by for-profit standards.”\nHe pointed to the Morristown chief executive’s compensation of $5 million in 2005, $1.6 million in 2006 and $6 million in 2007, including severance, and noted that hospital executives received an automobile stipend, a cellphone plan and a golf-club membership.\n“For purposes of the property tax exemption, modern non-profit hospitals are essentially legal fictions,” Bianco wrote, saying that it was time for the Legislature — and not the courts — to set a new standard for such an exemption. The tax code that provides hospitals with property-tax exemptions was written in 1913.\n“He’s reversing 100-some years of tradition in the state of New Jersey,” said Frank Ciesla, who represents hospitals as head of the health law practice at Giordano, Halleran & Ciesla. For most municipalities, “this is obviously a potentially huge source of revenue,” he said. “I’ve got to believe that if this was sustained, the hospital would be largest ratable in many communities.”\nBut for hospitals that are struggling financially, the obligation to pay taxes could “push some hospitals over the edge,” Ciesla said.\nThe case will almost certainly be appealed, he added. “There’s an outside possibility that the hospital would have a case that goes to the U.S. Supreme Court,” he said. Another solution would be legislation that provides explicit, “black letter guidance” about the requirements for a property-tax exemption, he said.\nLegislation sought State Sen. Joseph Vitale, chairman of the Senate health committee, said Wednesday that he had already requested a bill to be drafted to clarify that tax-status of non-profit hospitals.\nAs a condition of maintaining their non-profit designation, Vitale said, hospitals should require the physician practices that lease space on their property to participate in the same insurance contracts — and accept the same in-network reimbursements from insurance companies — that the hospitals do. The measure would reinforce a legislative effort to rein in surprise medical bills from hospital-based physicians, which Vitale and three Assembly Democrats hope to advance this fall.\n“It’s a fair trade-off,” Vitale said. “The people they’re treating are actually paying taxes.”\nForcing hospitals to pay property taxes may not be a good idea, Vitale said.\n“It’s a great way to get ratables. It’s also a great way to drive up health care costs,” he said. “The cities benefit, but nobody else.”\nLocal governments are taking a wait-and-see approach to the prospect of new tax revenues, said Michael J. Darcy of the New Jersey League of Municipalities. “The smart folks are saying, let’s see how this finally plays out,” Darcy said. “Wait until the ruling is really finalized, then take that and have a conversation with your local hospital.\n“It’s important for everyone in the community to contribute to the tax base,” Darcy said. “The bills have to be paid to pick up the trash and clean the streets. Whatever is not being contributed by a non-profit has to be picked up residents and commercial entities.”\nTax-exempt property In Bergen and Passaic counties, The Valley Hospital, Hackensack University Medical Center, Englewood Hospital and Medical Center, Holy Name Medical Center and St. Joseph’s Healthcare System own many acres of tax-exempt property in various towns, including off-site centers for patient care as well as their hospital properties. Two hospitals — St. Mary’s General Hospital in Passaic and HackensackUMC at Pascack Valley, in Westwood — are owned by for-profit companies.\nHackensack medical center, through a spokeswoman, said it was “monitoring the situation.”\nThe president of the New Jersey Hospital Association, with 72 members, said the Morristown decision “will have repercussions beyond one hospital. The implications of this decision will be the topic of much further discussion and perhaps will need a legislative solution.”\nMorristown Medical Center, one of four hospitals owned by Atlantic Health System, has hired new counsel and is considering its options, said Robert Seman, a spokesman. The 122-year-old hospital has 700 beds and a campus of 1.1 million square feet in Morristown. The actual amount of taxes owed on the property has yet to be determined, he said.\nWhile disappointing, Seman said, last Friday’s decision “does not call into question the charitable status of the hospital. We remain a not-for-profit organization.”\nEmail: washburn@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T07:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T14:07:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
