Travel agents now have access to search and book Peruvian Airlines’ services via Travelport’s innovative Travel Commerce Platform, including web fares and group fares.\nPeruvian Airlines was one of the first Latin American carriers to sign up for Travelport Rich Content and Branding, a key component of the industry-leading Travelport Merchandising solution. More than 100 airlines have already signed up for Travelport Rich Content and Branding, which enables carriers to more effectively control how their flights and ancillaries are visually presented and described on travel agency screens, in a similar way to the airline’s own website experience.\n“Having Peruvian’s content on Travelport is going to deliver real value to our business,” said Alberto Lopez, general manager of Peruvian Airlines. “Travelport Rich Content and Branding allows us to creatively promote our content to travel agents and consumers, while differentiating our brand from those of our competitors. As relative newcomers in the Latin American airline industry, we’re eager to offer our attractive fares and regional air services to Travelport’s extensive network of connected travel agencies around the globe.”\n“Travelport is committed to providing Peruvian and other airline partners with innovative technology, like Travelport Rich Content and Branding, that gives travel agency customers access to unrivalled airline content,” said Jonathan Sutter, Travelport’s senior director of the Americas region. “We’re pleased Peruvian Airlines has joined the growing number of Latin American air carriers who make their content available with Travelport. Travelport looks forward to supporting Peruvian in their continued growth and success in achieving their long-term commercial aims.”\nFrom its headquarters in Lima, Peruvian connects Peru’s capital with several of the country’s most important cities and tourist destinations. The airline is currently upgrading its Boeing 737 fleet, and plans to expand its route network and increase the frequency of flights between popular destinations within Peru and beyond.\nRelated Posts TripAdvisor Travelport Launches Hotel Extranet Capability for Independent Hotels Travelport signs full content agreement with Air India Sabre inks deal with Peruvian Airlines for full content distribution", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T21:05:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
