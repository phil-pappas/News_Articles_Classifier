Commenting on its participation in this year’s event, Ekaterina Senina, CEO at Gorky Golf Club, CJSC, said: “Gorki Golf Club is the only venue with an 18-hole course in the North-West region of Russia. With the impressive list of buyers and international golfers set to attend, IGTM offers us a variety of opportunities to showcase Gorki Golf Club and present Russia as a key, emerging golf destination.”\nAnother first time exhibitor at IGTM 2015 is Vietnam, with Vinpearl Golf Club Management. Niklas Robinson, the company’s Director of Sales and Marketing, said: “Having been named ‘Undiscovered Golf Destination of the Year’ in 2012 by the International Association of Golf Travel Operators, Vietnam continues to be one of the world’s leading up-and-coming golf destinations.\n“We have a very active pipeline of new facilities coming on board in the next three years, with two new venues coming into the portfolio and many more in the years thereafter.\n“We are therefore very keen to put the Vinpearl Golf brand on the global map and believe IGTM 2015 will provide the ideal platform to showcase the company, as well as to promote Vietnam as a high-class golf destination.”\nPeter Grimster, IGTM Exhibition Manager, said: “IGTM provides the ideal place for the entire international golf tourism industry to come together in one place to network and do business with new and established golf markets.\n“We continue to enhance IGTM every year and the increase in first time exhibitors from many of the key emerging markets for this year’s event, along with the more established ones, again highlights the health of the golf tourism market, with a strong outlook for 2016.”\nMore than 450 companies have committed to exhibit at IGTM 2015, highlighting the event’s broad appeal as an established meeting place for golf tourism professionals from across the globe. More than 1,450 individuals, representing national and regional golf tourism organisations, leading resorts and golf courses attended the event in 2014, with a similar number expected to descend on Tenerife in 2015.\nRelated Posts International Golf Travel Market (IGTM) announces Tenerife as host destination for 2015 Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium Golf Travel Egypt launched at the International Golf Travel Market (IGTM) International Golf Travel Market 2013 set to welcome first time exhibitors from around the world New research reveals golfers are taking more golf breaks now than in 2009", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T19:54:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
