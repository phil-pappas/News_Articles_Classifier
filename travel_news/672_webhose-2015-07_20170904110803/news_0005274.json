Gareth A Davies A tea fit for cricketing kings. . . there was so much variety. It was wonderful that the cricketers all have a hand in producing much of the food: eggs from the farms, milk from cows we could see from the clubhouse, meat and the most delicious pork pies from the butcher who is the club treasurer and whose son plays in the first team; home-grown asparagus, raspberries, tomatoes and cucumbers. A match-winner. Xanthe Clay The quiches are a beautiful yellow, from the eggs from the Stobbs farm, and some of their cakes, too. The local Wensleydale cream created an unctuous mix in the cakes. Will Stobbs, the team’s scorer, made fantastic fairy cakes, with butterflies of icing, and inside each one, a fresh raspberry. The pork pies had crispy pastry, lovely savoury jelly and a good bit of meat. The asparagus quiche was delicious. Vaughan's verdict: the lemon drizzle cake Each finalist bakes a cake for former England captain Michael Vaughan. The triple-layered lemon drizzle cake was made by Angie Chandler, mum of leg-spinner and batsman Josh. Michael Vaughan says: \"It was very, very tasty and there was plenty of it. That’s exactly what you want for a cricket tea.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T20:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T17:29:29.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
