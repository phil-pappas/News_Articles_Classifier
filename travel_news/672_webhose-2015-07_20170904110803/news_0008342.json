The Gulf stream here allows plant species normally too delicate for the harsh Scottish climate to flourish. Inverewe estate manager Paul Bolton said: “This is a lovely walk that takes you through a range of habitats from moorland to native woods and through plantation woodland too. The highlight are definitely the fantastic views to the Torridon Hills and back to Loch Ewe and Poolewe, plus the opportunities to spot wildlife. Look out for a pine marten scurrying through the woods or a crossbill feeding on the pine cones, and look up to make sure you’re not missing a buzzard, or even an eagle.” • 10 reasons to visit Scotland this summer Inverewe Gardens are on the banks of Loch Ewe Photo: AP Grade: Moderate Terrain: There are some inclines and the terrain is rough in places.There are also steps which make it unsuitable for wheelchairs. Distance: 1¼ miles / 2km Time: Aproximately 45 mins OS Map: Landranger Sheet 19 The route Start: Inverewe Gardens Car Park. The route is on a marked path. 1. Admire the view overlooking Poolewe village. The majestic Corsican pines, just in front of you, were planted 100 years ago. When those trees were tiny saplings, many visitors to Poolewe arrived by steam ship. The disembarking passengers would have seen crops growing in the fields and stacks of peat by each croft house, but not the wooded landscape you see today. Enter the plantation by the stone steps. • Great days out in the UK 2. Notice the different shades of conifers in the plantation. Scots pine is the only native conifer used for timber. Sitka spruce and lodgepole pine were introduced from North America. They can grow in our poor soils but may be blown down before they mature. Pine Martens may be visible en route. Photo: AP 3. The moorland landscape you see on the other side of the loch is typical of large areas of Wester Ross. More woodland existed here thousands of years ago but climate changes and clearance by people have reduced the amount of native woodland. 4. The mountains in the distance are the spectacular Torridon hills. An ancient Scots pine wood still grows there, having survived at Beinn Eighe for thousands of years. The ‘Great Wood of Caledon’ covered vast areas of Scotland thousands of years ago when the climate was more favourable. 5. The rock you are standing on is Torridonian sandstone, forming the underlying geology for much of the surrounding area. The stunted trees you can see are struggling to grow in the rocky terrain. Typical moorland plants such as heather and crowberry, growing nearby, provide clues as to how the landscape looked before this forest was planted. • Scotland's best driving routes 6. The blocks of forest that blanket the moor are typical of many post–World War II forestry plantations that were planted to provide timber. These dark plantations do not favour wildlife and will not be replaced. Future management on the wider Inverewe Estate will encourage the natural growth of native trees wherever they are able to flourish. The aim is to achieve a diverse landscape that includes a harmonious mixture of native woodland and moorland, which will provide a habitat for wildlife. 7. The beautiful mountain before you is Beinn Airigh Charr (meaning hill of the shieling). In the past people lived in shielings during the summer while their animals grazed the mountain pasture. Grazing has increased with the introduction of sheep and rising numbers of deer. This has prevented trees from growing, resulting in the treeless landscape in front of you. • How the National Trust saved our coastline 8. This area was cleared of lodgepole pine in 1998, allowing plenty of light for new trees to grow. The birch is a pioneering tree with a near–weightless seed that can travel far on the wind. It is the first tree to colonise this open ground, forming new woodland. The attractive trees with orange bark are Scots pines that eventually may become very old ‘granny pines’. They will provide food for seed–eating birds such as crossbills and some of the seed may grow into the future generation of pines.
