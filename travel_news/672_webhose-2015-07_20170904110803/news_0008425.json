It has been a learning curve.”\nThe heat remains on Port Adelaide’s defence, which will again be without linchpin Alipate Carlile and possibly Jasper Pittard, who must prove he’s overcome an ankle strain.\nSt Kilda’s master Nick Riewoldt and apprentice Paddy McCartin - the No.1 draft pick of 2014 - will pose a hazard from 12.10pm Sunday at Adelaide Oval.\nRiewoldt, 32, booted three goals in St Kilda’s comfortable win against Melbourne at the MCG last round and remains potent in the twilight of his glorious career, despite a nagging calf ailment.\n“Nick Riewoldt has been a superstar of the game for a ridiculous amount of years and our back six will have our work cut out with their forwards,” said Trengove\nIt will take a tag-team effort to nullify triple All Australian Riewoldt.\n“It’s a good challenge for us as a group. We have a younger group down back but it’s a chance for our team to defend as one,” said Trengove.\nPort is two games behind eighth-placed North Melbourne and must win its remaining six games to slip into the finals.\nOnly an elusive four-quarter effort - that was the hallmark of its consecutive final appearances in 2013-14 - will cut it against Alan Richardson’s resurgent Saints.\n“Every week now is a pressure game but we have a little bit of form back,” said Trengove of Port, which defeated Essendon by 13 points last Saturday at Etihad Stadium.\n“I think we are building towards that four-quarter performance, team footy and keeping the opposition to a low score.\n“You can’t get caught in your own game but we have to go back to that team-style defence of previous years.”\n.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T20:27:20.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
