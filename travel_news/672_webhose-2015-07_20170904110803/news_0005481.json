But that's more than offset by its signature benefit: a one-year Admirals Club membership, normally priced at $500 for non-elites. \nAdditional benefits include the following: 10,000 elite-qualifying miles after charging $40,000 $100 Global Entry or TSA PreCheck fee credit No foreign transaction fees Priority check-in, airport screening, and boarding privileges Waived baggage fees for first domestic checked bag Concierge service from Citi No cap on earned miles \nLately, the sign-up bonus has hovered around the 50,000-mile mark. But for a limited time, new cardholders are being offered 75,000 bonus miles after charging $7,500 to the card within three months of signing up. That's not the highest it's ever been for this card—there was a 100,000-mile sign-up bonus on offer last year—but it's definitely on the high end of the historical range, and may be as rich a bonus as there will ever be again. \nThere's no published end date to this sign-up bonus, so it could be ratcheted back down at any time.
