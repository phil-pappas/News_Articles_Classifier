Ninety minutes before the tragedy, the public school pupil, who lived with his parents and twin brother, Earl, in the family’s £2.5million home in Brighton, had sent a smiling selfie of himself standing a few yards away from where he fell. \nAn onlooker said: ‘The cliff at this spot has no fence. Most British people you see there keep about 30ft back. But foreign visitors — parties from schools or English language colleges, or Japanese tourists — apparently aren’t aware the cliffs can crumble. \n‘Some go to within a foot of the edge, not knowing they are standing on an overhang that could break away at any moment — and they are there all for the sake of a selfie.’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T12:14:56.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
