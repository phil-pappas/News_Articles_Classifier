The solution calculates flight costs for complex itineraries much quicker and more efficiently than the industry standard.\nVamo was founded by Ari Steinberg, former head of Facebook’s Seattle engineering office, with the goal of making it simple for travelers to plan and book multi-destination trips. In 2013 it raised $1.6 million from angel investors and in the same year entered a partnership with Vayant.\nVayant has supported Vamo’s development from the early stages and provided the startup with a custom flight search solution that relies on Vayant’s precomputed pricing and shopping technology. The solution means Vamo can display accurate and available prices for multi-destination trips in just milliseconds. It also lets Vamo suggest to travelers the best dates to fly and for how many days.\nMost recently Vamo has used Vayant technology for its innovative PriceMyTrip feature. This allows people to get a price Quote: for their next international trip by using the #PriceMyTrip hashtag on Twitter.\nEric Dumas, CEO of Vayant, commented, “Vayant and Vamo are a great partnership because we both want to do the same thing: challenge the old way of doing things and innovate to make travel shopping easy, intuitive and fun.”\nVamo’s CEO Ari Steinberg added “Vamo is changing the way that people search for travel, so it stands to reason that we need partners that are themselves innovative and intelligent. Vayant has proven to be quite capable, and has been a great partner to work with.”\nSource: Vayant\nTags: Ari Steinberg , Vamo , Vayant , Vayant Travel Technologies", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T11:51:58.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
