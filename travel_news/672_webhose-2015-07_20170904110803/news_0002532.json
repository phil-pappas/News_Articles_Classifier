Mahan The airport facade and entrance is slated for an upgrade in 2015. The Dayton International Airport is gearing up to invest more than $38 million over the next two years in new infrastructure projects. About $14 million of that will go toward extensive renovations to the terminal, said Terry Slaybaugh , director of aviation for the city-owned airport. The current facility, built in late 1950s, is starting become a structural issue. Other projects on tap include $5 million for HVAC system upgrades and controls, expected to save a lot of money in energy efficiency; $7 million in sanitary sewer replacement; and $12 million to compete upgrades to surface parking lots. Bidding on much of the work should start taking place later this year. Currently, airport officials are finalizing a contract to start work on the “blue” lot this fall and work on the economy lot will come next year. The massive amount of work coming at Dayton International is great news for the region because it will provide a wealth of business opportunities for the winners and their subcontractors. Additionally, this adds to the long list of improvements already made under Slaybaugh’s watch to make Dayton a more attractive option for passengers. We first told you earlier this year that a massive amount of investments would likely be happening at the airport. Click here to read that story. The terminal renovation project will be the most visible of all the work being done. It will include a new canopy and support structures; eliminating the curb, so the surface is seamless and easier to navigate for those with disabilities; new shelters for courtesy shuttle buses, taxis and valet parking; new rental car counters; and replacing the front wall with a glass curtain wall that allows more natural light. In addition, the rest rooms before the TSA security lines will be updated and the entrance moved behind Boston Stoker. That’s big because it means people won’t have to walk against the traffic coming out of the terminal. This is the first of five phases, which combine for as much as $140 million in investments over the next five to 10 years. Future phases will include elevated concourses and an expansive food court area, which are expected to grow concession revenue.

Slaybaugh said the original long-term plan to upgrade the airport turned out to be too expensive, so it was revamped to make more use of the existing infrastructure. Funding for the first phase is secured — a combination of federal grants, bond financing and money from operating revenue such as the passenger facility charge on tickets and rental car transaction fees paid to the airport — and a plan is in place to fund future phases. Dayton International also is in the first phase of a nearly $90 million, decade long effort to upgrade its airfield and is nearing the start of construction on a new hangar for Dayton-based PSA Airlines . It’s important for the airport to keep a close eye on its budget, but push to improve infrastructure to stay competitive and avoid structural failures, Slaybaugh said. \nWant Dayton Logistics & Transportation news in your inbox?
