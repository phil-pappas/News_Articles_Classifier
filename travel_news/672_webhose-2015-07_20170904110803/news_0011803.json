TTG Media will be the new site’s media partner. \nThe WorkAdvisor review system gives employees the chance to review and rate their company on five key metrics, such as whether it is a “fun and sociable place to work”, how staff are motivated, career development, job security and if they would recommend the company as an employer. \nThese marks are then combined to give the company an overall performance rating from one to five. \nPrice said: “We review and talk about our holidays, a meal out and even our latest gadget purchase but the place where we spend 58% of our waking hours - at work - is ignored. \n“Employee reviews are a great way for people in travel to let both their company and potential employees know what it is really like to work in that business. \n“But this is not about showing travel companies in a bad light. We expect the majority of reviews to be positive, whereas others will show how employers can engage more effectively with their people.” \nThe site offers travel firms the chance to respond to comments and ratings from employees in a similar way to TripAdvisor. They can also promote their brand by uploading information, videos and interviews.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T13:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T21:27:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
