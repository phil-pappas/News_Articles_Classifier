A notice released by the National Park Service on Wednesday detailed the episode, which began when a 43-year-old and her child turned their backs to a bison while trying to take a selfie. The animal was about six yards away. (It is illegal to be closer than 25 yards to the animals, park officials said.) The visitors tried to get away when they heard the bison approach, but the animal lifted the woman up and tossed her with its head. She is the fifth person to be injured in an encounter with one of the park’s bison this summer. “People need to recognize that Yellowstone wildlife is wild, even though they seem docile,” said Colleen M. Rawlings, a district ranger. “This woman was lucky that her injuries were not more severe.” The park’s warnings are not subtle: Upon entering, visitors receive a bright yellow flier that depicts a person getting gored by a bison. Julena Campbell, a public affairs officer for Yellowstone, said in a phone interview that the summer, which is breeding season, is the most dangerous time to be near the animals. The hormones coursing through the bison render them “like teenagers,” Ms. Campbell said — just more dangerous. Officials at Yellowstone estimate that the bison population there fluctuates from 2,300 to 5,000 animals, depending on breeding patterns. On social media, the creatures appear to be a crowd pleaser.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T17:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T18:58:55.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
