Suddenly, it’s 2013 all over again. Mitchell Johnson is ferocious, England are in disarray and if this Test lasts five days it will only be because Sunday’s forecast has turned watery. Much like England’s batsmen.\n“Scoreboard pressure. Yes, yes, we know. It was always going to be a different proposition to bat once Australia had amassed a cricket score that was like, well, a cricket score. Yet even with 566 to chase down – or 367 to avoid the follow on, which would be the first step to earning a draw – there really wasn’t much excuse for this.”\nEngland's new ball struggles at Lord's 0:40 Play video\nCricket: Following Australia's impressive haul in the first innings at Lords, England fall further behind the pace as they struggle with the new ball\nFox Sports 18 Jul 2015 Sport/Cricket/Ashes/Highlights\nMIKE ATHERTON — The Times\n“When Michael Clarke’s team came at England after tea, after the eventual declaration, there was a ferocity and intensity to their out-cricket that recalled the nightmarish months in Australia during 2013-14, when, inspired by Mitchell Johnson, England capitulated meekly and without rejoinder.\n“With more than 550 on the board and a short session to bowl, the final two hours of the day presented a perfect storm, which England’s top order was unable to weather.\n“This time it was not just Johnson but his fellow left-armer, Mitchell Starc, who began things off at the Pavilion End, and Josh Hazlewood, who probed with the new ball from the Nursery End with the kind of surgical precision of which Glenn McGrath would have been proud. With as many as five slips in place, and catchers dotted around in front of batsmen, Australia suddenly looked a very different team, Clarke a very different captain.\n“This was classic Ashes cricket that thankfully pushed the tameness of the previous day’s encounter from the memory.”\nTweet of the day ...\nNews has reached New York of a nightmare in St John’s Wood. Please let it be no more than wicked rumour … #ashes\n— Stephen Fry (@stephenfry) July 17, 2015\nImage of the day\nMitchell Johnson gets airborne after taking the wicket of England’s Joe Root. Source: AFP\nWhat the players are saying:\nMITCHELL JOHNSON\n“I didn’t actually (doubt myself) at all. I’ve felt the same since (blitzing England in 2013-14) really. Nothing has changed for me.\n“It would be nice to have those (England) scars come back out. It was a plan to go hard at Root and not let him settle.\n“There has been times when I’ve been a bit flat maybe and haven’t bowled 150 clicks, but I’m still trying to hit the wicket hard and bowl a good rhythm.\n“The ball has been swinging over here which has been amazing and when the ball is swinging at good pace it makes it more difficult (for the batsmen).”\nSTUART BROAD\n“It’s always a tricky period when you’ve conceded a lot of runs to then go out and bat for 30 overs.\n“It’s always a big test for you and I think mentally we didn’t switch on for 20 minutes — and lost four wickets.\n“We’re hoping for blue sky in the morning and our aim is to get up to that follow-on because if we do Australia will have to bat again, and that takes a lot of time out of the game.\n“Cooky and Stokesy applied themselves, played their game-plans really well.\n“There’s no demons in this wicket. We’ve got 16 wickets left in the Test match, so I certainly expect a couple of big hundreds in there at some stage.”\nAs it happened in our blog ...\nDay 2 - Second Ashes Test (Frame content direct link: http://embed.scribblelive.com/Embed/v7.aspx?Id=1385343&ThemeId=27311 .)\nOriginally published as The Verdict: Back with a vengeance", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content4.video.news.com.au/foxsports/prod/archive/2015/07/18/DVU_1807_CRI_ENGLAND_WICKETS.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://embed.scribblelive.com/Embed/v7.aspx?Id=1385343&ThemeId=27311", "https://twitter.com/stephenfry/status/622073449347973120", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content4.video.news.com.au/foxsports/prod/archive/2015/07/18/DVU_180715_CRI_ASHES_T2_STEVE_SMITH_200_AT_LORDS.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-3165700/England-s-batsmen-weak-weak-weak-s-like-2013-Australia-again.html", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ashes?src=hash", "http://cricket.foxsports.com.au/match-home.html?tournamentName=eng-aus-2015&matchId=eng-aus-2015-02", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/18/1227446/729157-59671f56-2ccf-11e5-8333-417e4c2de3cb.jpg", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/cricket/ashes-2015-mitchell-johnson-and-steve-smith-show-england-exactly-what-theyre-capable-of-after-slow-starts-to-the-series/story-fni2fnmo-1227446729185", "https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/215189570&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false", "http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/cricket/article4501425.ece"], "published": "2015-07-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T03:20:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
