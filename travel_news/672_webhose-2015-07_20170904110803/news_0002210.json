With the starting of Kumbh Mela, visitor numbers to Maharashtra is bound to increase.\n“The flag was hoisted at 6:16 am (0046 GMT) with Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis presiding,” Nashik district information officer K. Moghe said.\nWhile Tuesday’s hoisting marked the official opening of the 2015 Kumbh Mela, only a few hundred pilgrims attended the ceremony and mass crowds are not expected to gather until the first main bathing day on Aug 29.\nThe Kumbh Mela — a celebration of faith in which Hindus bathe in a sacred river — is held every third year and is rotated between four holy sites.\nIt is held at Nashik every 12 years and, although it isn’t on the same scale as the editions on the Ganges at Haridwar and the Saraswati at Allahabad, it still draws millions of pilgrims.\nOrganisers of this year’s event at Nashik are desperate to avoid a repeat of a deadly stampede at the same venue 12 years ago.\nThirty-nine pilgrims were trampled to death and dozens injured when the religious festival was last held by the Godavari river in Nashik, around 160 kilometres (100 miles) northeast of Mumbai, in 2003. The deadly crush was believed to have been triggered when a sadhu, or holy man, threw coins into a crowd of pilgrims who were waiting on the river banks.\nTens of thousands of the devotees, forced to stand behind barricades, were reportedly getting increasingly restless while having to wait for their holy dip.\nWhen the coins were thrown they scrambled to gather them resulting in dozens of people suffocating, according to reports at the time.\nOrganisers expect up to ten million pilgrims to attend the main bathing dates, which fall on Aug 29, Sept 13 and Sept 18 and 20,000 police are being deployed to man the crowds.\nRoutes to the river have been changed to avoid steep slopes and overcrowding while a temporary intensive care unit has been set up to urgently deal with any injured.\nThe Kumbh Mela has its origins in Hindu mythology, which describes how a few drops of the nectar of immortality fell on all of the places that host the festival, the fourth being Ujjain in central India.\nRelated Posts ‘Earn While you Learn’ Programme – India Courtyard Marks 1,000th Hotel Milestone With Global Celebrations And 50 Million Marriott Rewards Points AVIAREPS represents airberlin in the Indian market New tourism campaign to promote South Australia", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T10:11:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
