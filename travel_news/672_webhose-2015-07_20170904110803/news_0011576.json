To make your stay their more relaxing, a hearty breakfast is prepared each morning and served in the restaurant, which also serves Creole cuisine. Exciting excursions to the neighbouring islands such as Praslin, Curieuse and the Sister Islands are also part of the many activities catered for at this establishment. Other adventures at sea such as fishing and diving are also organised. \n\nOpening the Bamboo Chalets, Minister St.Ange said he is happy to see a Seychellois going forward in the island’s tourism industry. \n\n“It is a pride for our government when we see that Seychellois people are responding to the appeal made for us to claim back our tourism industry which is the pillar of our economy,” the Minister said. “This new venture by Mr Louis d’Offay is a good example of a Seychellois working hard for our islands to claim back its tourism industry.” \n\nHe added that the Ministry of Tourism and Culture as well as the Seychelles Tourism Board will continue to offer their support to Mr D’Offay and his Team. \n\nMinister St.Ange said it is good to see a Seychellois hotelier like Mr Louis D’Offay today having a group of hotels under his management. “Mr d’Offay who also runs the Cote d’Or apartments and Hotel L’Archipel on Praslin island now has a property on La Digue Island” said Minister St.Ange. \n\nMr d’Offay said it is an honour for him and his team to be part of La Digue’s tourism sector and to contribute to the development of its economy. \n\nThe night ended with a sumptuous Creole buffet and sweet local delicacies, while being entertained by the Harmonics band. \n\nTo mark this momentous occasion, well-known Seychellois artist Patrick Victor was present to entertain the guests as they danced the night away. \n\nWitnessing the opening of the Bamboo Chalets were the Seychelles Tourism Board’s marketing director Rose-Marie Hoareau, Eddie d’Offay who is the deputy managing director of Hotel L’Archipel and the two other establishments, other family members and friends of Mr d’Offay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T13:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T13:59:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
