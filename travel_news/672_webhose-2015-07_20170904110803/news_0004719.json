Why Hong Kong should embrace its wild side 4 Jul 2015 - 9:12pm \nWhen the road you're aiming for vanishes on your car's GPS navigation system, you know you're in for an adventure. Sandwiched between trucks heading to the landfill at the end of Wo Keng Shan Road near Fanling, we missed the turn onto the road leading up to Robin's Nest and had to double back. \nWe eventually found the road, a two-way affair that's barely the width of one car. We gingerly negotiated the steep and winding 3km track until finally we reached a dead end just below the 492-metre peak, very near the border with China. \nI scaled the dirt trail to the summit on foot. As I looked out towards the hazy Shenzhen skyline, surrounded by a vast sea of green and waves of silence, I reflected on how fortunate we've been to have a car at our disposal for the past few months. \nI never saw the point of having a car in Hong Kong, what with the perpetual traffic jams, impatient drivers and sky-high parking fees. And the city's efficient public transport system generally does a great job of getting you around. \nBut having our own wheels has helped us discover more of the city - its geography, history and culture - and deepened my affinity for it. Especially with a baby, having a car makes travelling easier and has sparked our sense of exploration. \nWhile we're certainly not championing more cars on the road, we encourage you to rev up a mini road trip in Hong Kong. Don't have a car? Rent one through carshare.hk , hire a driver through Uber or GoGoVan, or just take a taxi. Here are three routes we've tried and recommend. \n\nStop 1: Kowloon Peak \nThis 602-metre mountain, also known as Fei Ngo Shan, offers a panoramic view of Victoria Harbour. Head up the one-way Sha Tin Pass Road towards Tate's Cairn. You'll pass by some temples and pavilions, as well as many elderly morning walkers. On your right you'll have an intermittent view of the Hong Kong skyline. There's the four-decades-old Hang Jik food stall near Shap Yi Watt Village famous for its tofu pudding, but save your stomach for the upcoming pit stop. \nFollow Jat's Incline downhill, then take a left on Clear Water Bay Road and another left onto Fei Ngo Shan Road. You'll crest at Tung Shan (544 metres), where you can park and relax under a shaded pavilion that looks out over Kowloon to Hong Kong Island. \nTo get to Kowloon Peak, hike the trail adjacent to the pavilion - it's short (about 1.5km long) but technical, going up and down Middle Hill. Be prepared for overgrown trails and steep inclines. \nStop 2: Chuen Lung Village, Duen Kee Restaurant \nArrive hungry, because you're likely to overindulge at this self-service tea house. Set in a rustic village house at the foot of Tai Mo Shan, Duen Kee Restaurant (57-58 Chuen Lung Village, Route Twisk, 6am to 2pm, tel: 2490 5246) has been around since the 1950s. \nFor about HK$100, two of us stuffed ourselves silly with dim sum and drank our fill of tea made with stream water from Tai Mo Shan. We sat at a table under a parasol on the ground floor, but if you want to be serenaded, grab a seat on the second-floor terrace among the chirping birds in cages. \nBy 9am on a weekend a lot of the items will have sold out. You'll have another yum cha option round the corner, Choi Lung Restaurant (2 Chuen Lung Village, 5.30am to 3pm, tel: 2415 5041), but it's equally popular. \nStop 3: Tai Mo Shan \nYou can't drive all the way up Hong Kong's highest peak at 957 metres, but to a car park at about 830 metres elevation. Tai Mo Shan Road, a tight two-way road off Route Twisk, will take you to the spot. \nIf the weather's good, you'll have a spectacular panoramic view of the northern and western New Territories, the Yuen Long and Pat Heung plains, and even Shekou and Shenzhen on crystal clear days. When the temperature drops to near freezing point, you might catch a glimpse of frost. \nStop 4: Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden \nEstablished in 1956, this sprawling green sanctuary was originally set up by the Kadoorie brothers, Lord Lawrence and Sir Horace, to provide aid to poor local farmers. \nKadoorie Farm (Lam Kam Road, Tai Po, kfbg.org extends up the side of Tai Mo Shan and a network of footpaths and roads wind their way through vegetable gardens, greenhouses, animals, pavilions, bridges, waterfalls and picnic spots - you could easily spend a few hours wandering here. \nOn the upper reaches of the farm are two viewing points: the 550-metre Kwun Yam Shan and the Kadoorie Brothers Memorial Pavilion. There's a daily shuttle bus service but private cars are also allowed inside - just email info@kfbg.org in advance to reserve your space. \nRefresh and refuel at the outdoor Sun Garden cafe near the farm's entrance. There's vegetarian food and healthy drinks, but on a sweltering summer's day we opted for gelato and iced coffee instead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T14:12:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
