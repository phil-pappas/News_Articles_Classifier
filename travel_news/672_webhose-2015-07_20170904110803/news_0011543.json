The original Hermione was used in that battle.\nOn its way to New York, the ship stopped over in Mount Vernon, which is near Washington, then in Annapolis and Baltimore, both in Maryland, and in Philadelphia. It will move on to Boston and then to Canada.\nIn New York, the Hermione will be escorted by hundreds of sail and motor boats past the Statue of Liberty during a July 4 maritime procession to mark Independence Day.\nCraig Stapelton, a former US ambassador to France, and Bertrand Lortholary, the French consul general in New York, were to preside over a welcoming ceremony later Wednesday in New York.\nNew York was the last city liberated by Washington's troops, in 1783.\nThe metropolis now known as the Big Apple served briefly as US capital, from 1785 to 1790.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T04:09:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
