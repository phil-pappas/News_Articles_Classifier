The largest freshwater dunes in the entire world lie on West Michigan’s Lake Michigan shoreline. Stretching along the coast, Ottawa County is hundreds of acres of sand dunes accessible to the public. “They are a globally unique resource, the largest freshwater dunes in the world, right in our backyard,” said John Scholtz, Ottawa County Parks and Recreation director. “People come from across the ocean to see our dunes. “They’re just a special place.” Mt. Pisgah , a towering dune just east of Holland State Park, provides a 360-degree view of Lake Michigan, Lake Macatawa and the city of Holland. “It has great viewing decks where you can look out over Lake Michigan and the pier and out of Lake Macatawa,” Scholtz said. Lakeshore visitors can tour the dunes on hiking trails or even a guided tour from companies such as Saugatuck Dune Rides in Allegan County. — Follow this reporter on Twitter @SentinelCurtis .
