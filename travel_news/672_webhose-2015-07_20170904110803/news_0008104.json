Photo courtesy of Airbus American Airlines has started replacing its older fleet of Boeing 757s with new Airbus A321Hs on its Los Angeles-Hawaii routes. The A321H is a narrowbody, single-engine jet aircraft with 16 first class seats, 38 Main Cabin Extra seats and 127 Main Cabin seats.\nThe H stands for Hawaii, since the aircraft must earn special certification called Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards (ETOPS).\nETOPS allows the A321H to fly up to 180 minutes on a single engine, and the certification process is on track.\nThe first A321H will fly between Los Angeles International Airport and Honolulu International Airport on Aug. 18, 2015. The aircraft will have modern conveniences including in-seat personal entertainment, along with power and USB ports at every seat. The aircraft will also sport the new American branding, leather seating and IFE content that includes up to 200 movies and up to 180 TV programs\nBy the end of the year, American Airlines will replace the 757s with A321H on all flights between Los Angeles and each of its four Hawaiian destinations -- Honolulu, Kona, Lihue and Kahului, with a peak of 15 daily flights.", "external_links": ["http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/u/N/24035014_BG2.jpg", "http://www.boeing.com/history/products/757.page", "http://hawaii.gov/hnl", "http://www.airbus.com/aircraftfamilies/passengeraircraft/a320family/a321/", "http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/airbus-a320-family-approved-for-180-minute-etops-by-the-faa/", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/W/u/N/24035014_BG2.jpg", "http://www.lawa.org/welcomeLAX.aspx"], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T07:58:37.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
