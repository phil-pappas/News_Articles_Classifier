Working in partnership with Hosmark to create an event with a ‘Best of British’ theme, and with a £15,000 budget to work with, QEII pulled out all the stops to delight and entertain guests at their annual client summer party. \nFrom cherry blossom trees and strawberries and cream on the Green to a real grass indoor tennis court, everything quintessentially British was celebrated at the event, which showed just how versatile the QEII Centre can be. The 150 guests arrived to the vintage garden party on the Green, which overlooks Westminster Abbey, to enjoy champagne and Pimm’s while being entertained by live band The Wandering Hands and juggling tennis duo The Racketeers, both provided by Sternberg Clarke. Cherry blossom trees from Eventologists teamed with bunting, gingham covered hay bales for seating and herb boxes to bring a home garden feel to the Green. The themed menu featured delicious barbeque grilled meats and seasonal summer salads such as wild rocket and apple blossom and roast English heritage tomatoes and basil cream, alongside the classic strawberries and cream which no day at the tennis can do without. To connect the indoor event space with the outdoor celebrations seamlessly, QEII used the entertainers to lead guests inside to the lifts. A video wall in the foyer, featuring a tennis ball animation, and frosted Wimbledon imagery in the lifts gave a taste of things to come. Upstairs in the Mountbatten lounge, the Wimbledon scoreboard was projected over a real grass tennis court in front of the main stage, provided by Wow Grass, where guests could have a quick game themselves. The summer garden theming was brought inside with more blossom trees, box hedging and herb boxes dressing the space, and a lighting theme gradually taking the room from sunset to a beautifully lit summer’s night. QEII director of sales Diane Waldron spoke at the event and told guests: \"We're asking you to take another look at us and see us in another way. Look at us as a blank canvas venue. We're a big flexible space with the most incredible views in London, and we feel we're ideal for awards dinners, fashion shows, you name it. Hopefully what we're showing you tonight is that we are a venue for any type of event.\" Founded in 2001, Hosmark has a team of 12 senior industry professionals who offer an unrivalled level of expertise and knowledge in the meetings & events market.
