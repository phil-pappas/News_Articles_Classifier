It is understood ice has formed on the wings of the planes due to the morning's cold weather. \n\"A number of flights out of Melbourne are experiencing minor delays due to wing icing,\" a Qantas spokesperson said. \n\"Operations are expected to return to normal shortly.\" \nQantas passenger Colin Galston said an announcement in the domestic business lounge advised of \"unknown delays\" and asked for patience. \n\"Incredible, Qantas have just announced that as they do not have a de-icing machine they need to wait for the sun to come up. Many very unhappy folks in the lounge,\" he said. \nGalston is travelling to Adelaide with his 13-year-old son to watch Liverpool play tonight. The pair are worried about cancellations. \nOne passenger, who asked not to be named, was flying to Perth for a day of meetings before heading on to Adelaide. \nThe man arrived at 5.30am for his 6.30am flight, and was still stranded at 8.05am. Ad Feedback \n\"I'll be missing my first meeting,\" he said. \nThe man said he still hoped to make his afternoon meeting, then be back at the airport flying to Adelaide on Monday night. \nHe said the situation was confusing. \nQantas first told passengers there was no de-icing agent, then later said they needed to wait for the sun because the de-icing truck wasn't working. \n\"There's basically no information, to be honest,\" he said. - Sydney Morning Herald", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T01:42:35.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
