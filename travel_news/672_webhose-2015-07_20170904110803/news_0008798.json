The five international association conferences will attract over 5,300 delegates to Dublin, generating revenue in excess of €7 million for the local economy. The successful bids were secured in conjunction with Industry Partners and Dublin Convention Bureau (DCB), a unit of Fáilte Ireland, the National Tourism Development Authority. \nThe 7th European Conference on Interventional Oncology (ECIO) will take place in April 2016 and is set to welcome around 1,000 delegates. Interventional oncology is a branch of interventional radiology that deals with the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and the conference will provide a platform for specialists to discuss developments in the medical, oncology, radiology, cardiology and health care fields. ECIO 2015 was held in Nice in April and attracted attendees from 68 countries. The International Capital Market Association (ICMA) will hold its 48th Annual General Meeting and Conference in Dublin in May 2016 attracting in excess of 800 delegates. \"I am delighted that Dublin has been chosen as the venue for 48th ICMA AGM in 2016,\" said Martin Scheck, CEO of ICMA. \"We are looking forward to working with our members in Ireland, particularly the Irish Stock Exchange who played an important part in securing the AGM for Dublin, to make it a really great event and to showcase this extraordinary and economically successful city to ICMA's international members.\" ICMA is a leading trade association for institutions that are active in the international debt capital markets, focusing on fixed income primary and secondary markets. The International Federation of Freight Forwarders Association (FIATA) will host its 2016 world congress in October in association with Conference Partners, official PCO. Clare Kilmartin, Conference Director at Conference Partners commented \"We are delighted to be working with the Irish International Freight Association on FIATA 2016. It is a well-established congress which will bring up to 1,000 visitors to Dublin for almost a week long stay. This is a terrific boost for Dublin and the surrounds and we are really looking forward to the planning year ahead.\" FIATA represents 40,000 forwarding and logistics companies with an objective to unite the freight forwarding industry worldwide. FIATA 2015 will take place in Taiwan in September. The International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) will bring its annual congress to The CCD in October 2016 in association with Kenes International, official PCO and Dr Michael Capra, Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin, Congress President. “Location, accessibility, affordability and state of the art venue in The Convention Centre Dublin were the deciding factors to choose Dublin as the host city for the 48th SIOP Annual Congress,” said Dr Capra. “This is the first time this honour has been bestowed upon Dublin to host this vibrant and global organisation dedicated to improving and optimising childhood cancer treatment worldwide. I believe the Irish culture of hospitality will provide the ideal forum for the expected 2,000 international childhood cancer specialists to productively collaborate and disseminate advancements in the fight against childhood cancer, perhaps even playing a small role in helping SIOP in its vision that no child should die of cancer.” The 7th World Congress on Family Law and Children’s Rights (WCFLCR) will take place in June 2017 in association with Conference Partners, official PCO. The Congress is expected to attract around 650 delegates and is the leading international forum for discussion and deliberation on issues of family law and children’s rights.
