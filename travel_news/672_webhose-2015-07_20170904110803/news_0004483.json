Ugh, I’ll change in 15 minutes’,” she told news.com.au .\n“I couldn’t find anyone to dance with so I hitched my dress up and I went up to Sam Frost (from The Bachelor ) and I was like, ‘Hey everybody, do you mind if I dance with you because I have no friends?’\n“I didn’t leave the dance floor the whole night — except to go to the candy table.”\nThe 24-year-old television presenter now has a legitimate reason to steal baked goods and harass former Bachelor stars at Channel Ten events. She’s signed on as the new co-host for The Loop on the network’s second station — Eleven.\nOlivia joins Scott Tweedie as the new host of The Loop. Source: Channel 10\nJoining current co-host Scott Tweedie, she makes her debut on Saturday morning — playing the hottest new video clips and chatting with chart-topping artists.\nMaking the jump from ABC3 — where she co-hosts the daily program Studio3 — she’ll be juggling both roles and living between Sydney and Melbourne as she wraps up her former life and makes the permanent shift to the Saturday morning music video show.\nPresenting the daily kids program for three and a half years, Phyland has had her fair share of embarrassing on-air moments.\nBut nothing tops her “horrendous” first day on-air as a very green presenter.\n“They hit us with heaps of pies — so there was pies all over the ground,” she says.\n“I then went to run off and went up in the air, smashed onto my back, my mic pack dug into me and I was stuck on the ground.\n“Every time I went to stand back up I just skated back down so I had to spend the rest of the segment lying down waiting for it to finish and then they dragged me out.”\nWhile there are no plans for pie throwing on The Loop , Olivia and Tweedie — who’ve been friends since they met as presenters on ABC3 — already have a few tricks up their sleeves.\nAnd there’s a bet going if Olivia ever comes face-to-face with Jason Derulo on the show.\n“Tweedie has said he’ll give me $10 if I get him to show us his abs — it’s a mission.”\nCatch The Loop on Saturday mornings from 9am on ELEVEN.\nOlivia is jumping to Eleven from ABC3.
