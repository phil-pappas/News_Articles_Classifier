The Allett company has developed a line of RFID-protective wallets that are as slim and stylish as they are scan-proof. I tested out the wallet with a BART card enclosed, and the ticket scanner was indeed blocked at point-blank range. The black wallet is also a stealth way to hide your passport from old-school, five-finger theft as well, blending into the fabric background of a purse or suitcase. The leather is smooth, soft and grippy, and seems sturdy enough to last for many trips.
