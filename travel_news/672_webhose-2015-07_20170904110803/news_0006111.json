Sky News 14 Jul 2015 News Mount Raung ... Volcanic material spewed from Indonesia’s volcano glows in the night.

Bali tourists facing budget blowout \nTravellers are learning a harsh lesson about the need for insurance, with many seeing their “cheap” Bali holiday blow out by thousands as a result of the volcanic ash cloud. \nThe insurance industry estimates as many as 30 per cent of Australians travelling to Bali do so without insurance — or around 330,000 a year. \nCairns’ Joshua Paterson is among those facing a bill for thousands of dollars, after being stuck in Bali since last Friday. Clearing the backlog ... Indonesian authorities at Bali's international airport were fighting to clear a backlog after almost 900 flights were cancelled or delayed in recent days.

My insurance will only pay for my motel, it won’t pay for food,” she said. \nMost airlines flying out of Bali are not providing accommodation for affected passengers because the situation is beyond their control. \nHowever Virgin Australia is believed to be putting anyone up who has no other option but to sleep at the airport. Thousands stranded ... Mount Raung has caused chaos for holidaymakers as airports closed and international airlines canceled flights to tourist hotspot Bali. Picture: AP/Trisnadi Source: AP \nInsurance Council of Australia spokesman Campbell Fuller said airlines, insurers and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade were working together to assist people in Bali. \n“Thousands are being helped by their insurers with things like the provision of accommodation and reimbursement for unexpected costs,” said Mr Fuller. \nA DFAT spokeswoman said there was a provision in “exceptional circumstances” for small emergency loans for Australian travellers through the Consulate in Bali. \nBut to date there had not been a significant increase in demand for such assistance. \n“DFAT strongly recommends that all Australians travelling overseas take out comprehensive travel insurance,” she said. \nCraig Morrison from Southern Cross Travel Insurance said they had seen a 47 per cent increase in calls from Australians as a result of the Bali ash cloud. \n“Our advice to people who have been impacted by the volcano is to keep all documentation of cancellation from your airline including emails, along with receipts of additional expenses, including accommodation and meals, to submit a claim to your travel insurer,” Mr Morrison said. \nUniversity of Technology Sydney senior business lecturer Dr David Beirman said travellers were typically attracted by Bali’s cheap packages. \n“They do look for ways to save money, and unfortunately, some opt not to get travel insurance,” said Dr Beirman. \n“But as we often hear, if you can’t afford travel insurance, you can’t afford to travel.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T13:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:02:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
