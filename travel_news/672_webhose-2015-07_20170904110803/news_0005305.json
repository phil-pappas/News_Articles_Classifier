Popular with backpackers, who've been visiting the area since the 1970s, the tourist town has expanded in the past decade, but isn't in the league of Bali's Kuta or India's Goan beaches in terms of development. It's still a quiet destination.\nTHINGS TO DO\nYou can surf and snorkel at Hikkaduwa's beaches. Surfing is best November to March when waves are up to 3m high. If you’re a novice, you can hire a board and try learning to surf in front of the bars and restaurants on Hikkaduwa’s main beach.\nThere are coral reefs straight off the beach and turtles are regularly seen in these waters. Snorkels and flippers are available at numerous stalls, while boat trips offshore for snorkelling are also on offer.\nNorth of town is the Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery, where baby turtles are nurtured and hatched in captivity before being released to prevent them from perishing in fishing nets.\nUnderwater adventure ... a green sea turtle in the waters off Hikkaduwa.

Here you can read touching first-person stories, accompanied by drawings and photographs.\nThis is just north of Hikkaduwa near the giant standing Buddha put up by Japan after the tsunami.\nThere are many Buddhist temples around Hikkaduwa, all of which visitors are welcome to wander around. Just ask a tuktuk driver to show you a few.\nOne of the most significant is Thotagamuwa Rajamaha Viharaya, 2km north of town, with its regal stone statues of the Buddha, wall paintings and intricate woodwork.\nHikkaduwa's lakes are also a highlight. North of town, you can hire a canoe and paddle up the inland lakes to Kalla Bongo Lake Resort.\nSouth of Hikkaduwa, visit the eco-gardens on Ratgama Lake. There you can venture out on dugout canoes, rowed by locals, to a nearby temple on the lake and around islands where hermit monks reside.\nYou can have tea at the ecovillage and take a walk through the mangroves on the wooden walkway, from where you can often see big monitor lizards.\nGETTING AROUND\nOther than strolling down the beach, tuktuks are the ideal, cheap way to get around, and their drivers – who double as tour guides – generally spot you as soon as you pop your head out of your hotel.\nSHOPPING AND MARKETS\nNorth of Hikkaduwa is Ambalangoda, a town of shops packed with antiques, traditional wooden masks and puppets and colonial artefacts. If you do find a treasure, many shops can also help you ship these back home.\nIn and around Hikkaduwa there's also a silk factory, where you can see silkworms spinning, plus various batik shops and moonstone mines. Don't miss Hikkaduwa Sunday Markets.\nRelaxing vibe ... a surfer on the beach at Hikkaduwa, Sri Lanka.

The menu is a mix of local and Western food.\nGALLE DAY TRIPS\nHalf an hour's drive south of Hikkaduwa is the city of Galle, with its legendary cricket ground overlooked by the historic Galle Fort. It was established by the Portuguese more than 400 years ago, then further fortified by the Dutch in the 18th century, and you will need at least half a day to wander around this colonial relic.\nTake your time ... see the historic Galle Lighthouse. Picture: Getty Source: Getty Images\nOverlooking the ocean and Galle cricket ground, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is a walled district packed with art and craft galleries (many foreign residents here are artists), restaurants and cafes. You can also wander along its walls and soak up the colonial atmosphere, with stunning views of the ocean.\nFor a memorable tea or meal, don't miss the ultra-colonial Galle Fort Hotel.\nOther stunning historic buildings are the Dutch Reformed Church, Meera Mosque and Galle Lighthouse.\nApart from travelling to Galle by tuktuk, another option is taking the train from Hikkaduwa, for a very memorable experience.\nWEST OF GALLE\nSnorkelling across the rehabilitated reefs at Jungle Beach, near Galle, is another fun day trip.\nAs the name suggests, the beach is surrounded by lush forest with monkeys. Birds abound, and the area is reachable by tuktuk or boat. The reef is just 10m off the beach.\nThe water is clear and there's the Japanese Peace Pagoda atop a nearby hill.\nA few kilometres from Jungle Beach is Unawatuna Beach, a more developed seaside tourist town on the main road from Galle.\nWith hotels, shops and restaurants, from here you can go on boat trips to nearby reefs and Jungle Beach.\nAlternately, you can hike to Jungle Beach via the Japanese Peace Pagoda.\nAbout 240km southwest of Galle is Mirissa, a beautiful beachside village with surf breaks and a port where visitors can take whale-watching trips.\nIt's certainly worth more than a day trip. Rajah and the Whales is one popular company and trips regularly see blue whales, dolphins and occasionally killer whales.\nGO2\nSRI LANKA\nGETTING THERE\nSri Lankan Airlines and Singapore Airlines fly to Sri Lanka.\nSTAYING THERE\nIn Hikkaduwa The Beach House is a seaside residence where you can cook for yourself or walk along the beach to other restaurants such as Cinnamon Gardens, which has fabulous grilled calamari and curries. Aditya Resort is another beachside option. If you need to stop over in Colombo, Tamarind Tree Hotel is close to the airport with bungalows in tropical gardens.\nMORE\nFor tours into Sri Lanka's interior try srilankadaytours.com", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/07/1227432/747407-74a0b93c-215b-11e5-bfd8-23d4937b5704.jpg", "http://www.tamarindtreehotels.com/", "http://www.srilankan.com/", "http://www.srilankadaytours.com/", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/07/1227432/748240-6ffd70d2-215b-11e5-bfd8-23d4937b5704.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/07/1227432/748214-72091070-215b-11e5-bfd8-23d4937b5704.jpg", "http://srilankabeachhouse.com/", "http://www.singaporeair.com/", "http://aditya-resort.com/"], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T04:44:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
