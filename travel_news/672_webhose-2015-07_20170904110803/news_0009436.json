To test that theory, Telegraph invites proud owners to take our version of the famous Proust personality questionnaire on behalf of their animals. This week, art sleuth and TV presenter Philip Mould and his working cocker spaniel, Mabel, 12 Why the name Mabel? It was the female name with the least negative associations to my family. Her chief characteristic? The most unabating enthusiasm. If you leave the room and come back a few minutes later, she will greet you as if you’ve been away for a year. Which of her qualities do you most admire? Her generosity of spirit. She always feels obliged to give a present: a sock, a shoe, or a log from the basket. Even though she is a weekly boarder with friends in our village in Gloucestershire, she is as dutiful a daughter as ever. Her party trick? I decided not to teach her any because my previous dog became a bit of a party-trick bore. She endears through personality alone. What does she feel most strongly about? Pheasants. The sound of them, the sight of them, the prospect of hunting them. What are you grateful to her for? Even though she is a weekly boarder with friends in our village in Gloucestershire while I’m working in London, she is as dutiful a daughter as ever. Her idea of happiness? A week in a pheasant pen with Red Cross parcels of smoked salmon. Her wickedest moment? When I caught a salmon in Scotland, smoked it, carved it and laid it out for a dinner party, and later led my guests into the dining room to eight, shiny, clean plates, Mabel was licking her lips and I could smell fish on her breath. Does she feel remorse? For as long as you’re visibly angry with her. She doesn’t suffer from guilt. Philip Mould co-presents BBC One's Fake or Fortune with Fiona Bruce What makes her miserable? If she has to stay behind when we go out. Her whole being shrinks. Her major character flaw? Greed. As she gets older, she exercises less and eats more; you can hardly call her a “working” cocker anymore. How would she fare in the wild? She would do well as she can hunt her own food, a skill she learnt as a puppy, stealing picnics in Kensington Palace Gardens. How does she express discontent? Barking. She can do it for up to two hours straight. What irritates her most? Other dogs. She is only interested in a one-on-one relationship with a Homo sapiens . What is her present state of mind? She is in a state of mental suspended animation until I get home. Which of your faults does she tolerate most? My long baths. She enjoys lapping up the warm bath water and licking my wet back. It feels rather unearthly. If not herself, who would she be? Diana, the goddess of hunting. Her greatest achievement? Winning the “Most Beautiful Legs” competition in the dog show at our local fete in Gloucestershire. What is your biggest regret about her? That she isn’t a Labrador. When she falls off the mortal coil, I might look into a crossbreed of a lab and a spaniel. Philip Mould is co-presenter of BBC One’s Fake or Fortune? , Sundays 8pm. His gallery, Philip Mould & Co, has recently relocated to 18-19 Pall Mall, London SW1 ( philipmould.com ). • Proust for pets: Author Lesley Pearse and dog, Stan, take our personality quiz • Proust for pets: Jilly Cooper takes our new quiz on behalf of her greyhound, Bluebell telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T12:49:50.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
