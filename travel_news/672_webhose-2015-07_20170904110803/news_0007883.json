For airlines, they are quite literally a drag — a fuel-wasting, money-eating drag.\nScientists from NASA and leading plane manufacturer Boeing are pooling their collective genius to tackle the dilemma of keeping bug guts from sticking to airplane wings. Experimental flights above the insect-rich swamps of Louisiana are testing the value of non-stick coatings and new wing extensions.\nThe incentive for pest control is nothing to swat at. The U.S. Department of Transportation says the airline industry spent $48 billion on fuel last year for passenger and cargo planes. Wing improvements that carry planes more smoothly through the air could save the industry as much as $2.4 billion a year — with bugs counting as a slice of that pie.\nFayette Collier, director of NASA's Environmentally Responsible Aviation program, says giving bugs the brush off could shave 0.5% off fuel costs, or $240 million in savings.\n\"It is huge,\" Collier said of overall wing improvements. \"The carrot is so huge, you can't ignore it.\"\nTiny critters pose huge problems. No matter how clean a plane is on the ground, taking off through a cloud of bugs roughens the wing's leading edge. Bumpy wings from that momentary encounter increase drag and require the plane to burn slightly more fuel during hours of the entire flight.\nThe goal of wing research is to keep air flowing as smoothly as possible for as long as possible across the wing. NASA and Boeing are each eager to find solutions, which will be shared with the rest of the industry, to save fuel and reduce pollution.\n\"When you burn less fuel, the engines require less maintenance. We produce less emissions. There's less carbon dioxide,\" said Mike Sinnett, Boeing's vice president for product development. \"Across the board, burning less gas is a good thing.\"\nNASA has been looking to give bugs the brush off for at least 30 years. Decades ago, efforts included spraying a substance on the wing with anti-icing fluid, like buttering a skillet, so bugs would slip off, or attaching paper that peeled away after takeoff like a used napkin. But each had their own costs and environmental concerns.\n\"You really don't want to have littering in the sky,\" said Mia Siochi, a senior materials researcher at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va.\nEarly experiments used a gun to fire bugs — first crickets and then fruit flies — at the wings of planes to replicate the 150 mph speed of a jet taking off, she said. But it was tricky in the lab to match the sticky impact of bugs hitting a wing during takeoff.\n\"The insect, not knowing that it’s been catastrophically hit, is actually trying to heal, like blood coagulating to heal the wound,\" Siochi said. \"It's getting stickier.\"\nRecent efforts to reduce fuel consumption, pollution and noise are now the province of NASA's Environmentally Responsible Aviation program or ERA. Since 2009, ERA has spent about $420 million to identify and test eight strategies to improve jet performance and efficiency, Collier said. About $2 million to $3 million went toward bug research, with private partners such as Boeing also contributing, he said.\nBoeing and NASA scientists flew a Boeing 757, nicknamed the ecoDemonstrator, over the swamps around Shreveport, La., from April 27 to May 15 to test a couple of options — a coating like Teflon and a wing extension that shields the wing from bugs during takeoff.\n\"We don't have the answers yet,\" Sinnett said. \"That literally is what caused us to go out and find a plague of locusts.\"\nNASA developed five experimental surfaces, which were attached to the 757's right wing in 2-foot-by-3-foot plates. Researchers counted 100 to 200 bug splatters on a regular metal section of wing, but as much as a 40% reduction in splats on the best experimental panel.\n\"It was visible as you walked up to the wing,\" Siochi said. “Coatings are one way to have a passive, simple method if we can prevent the bugs from sticking in the beginning.\"\nThe best surface was inspired by the lotus leaf, she said. Tiny ridges that aren't visible to the naked eye let bug gunk run off like water rolling off a leaf.\n\"It looks like mountains,\" Siochi said. \"You have the water beads sitting on it, so you have only points touching the liquid. So it comes off.\"\nAnother option that looked promising in the Louisiana swamp was a wing extension that provides extra lift at takeoff, but then retracts to fit snugly beneath the wing at cruising altitude. The unexpected benefit is that, like a glove, the so-called Krueger flaps also shielded the wing of the ecoDemonstrator from bugs.\n\"That gives us an unintended capability to block the leading edge of the wing from bugs because the bugs smack into the Krueger first,\" Sinnett said. \"Then that Krueger folds away when you get up at cruise.\"\nWhile the flaps are installed on newer versions of the Boeing 747, they wouldn't necessarily work for all planes because of the shape and design of the rest of the wing, Sinnett said. Special coatings like the ones NASA is exploring could work on other planes.\nNow researchers are huddling to gauge the results. Airlines must weigh the costs and benefits of the adding the technology to the fleet, and whether the technology can withstand tens of thousands of flights. If the analysis looks promising, researchers say the gleaming result could appear routinely outside airliner windows in the mid-2020s.\n“We’re looking into the future,\" Collier said. \"The wing is the next thing.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T09:38:06.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
