The agency posted two blogs (see links below) about these deceptive practices, warning consumers of this growing problem and offering advice on how to avoid scams.\n“AH&LA applauds the recent actions by the FTC to warn consumers about rogue online booking websites that are deliberately deceiving consumers by posing as the hotel’s direct booking site, a scam which affects more than 2.5 million bookings a year,” said Katherine Lugar, president and CEO of AH&LA. “These scams leave consumers out in the cold, causing them to not get what they wanted or paid for, and leaving them to deal with everything from additional room charges, cancellation fees or service charges and accessibility problems.\n“It’s clear the FTC recognizes that consumers are indeed being harmed by these rogue sites. The FTC’s actions further validate our concerns and we remain optimistic that the regulators will crack down on rogue online booking sites.”\nSource:-Ah&la\nRelated Posts 40% reduction in room rates in Grand Hyatt Taipei in July and August AH&LA bids FTC to investigate and stop deceptive hotel booking sites Express your love this Valentine’s Day at Calabash Cove Resort & Spa Preferred Hotel Gruop Announces 2013 Results Lodging Industry Praises New York High Court OTC Ruling", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T11:13:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
