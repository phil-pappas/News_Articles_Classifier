No? Neither do retailers. \nVisa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express and their banking partners have set a government-enforced deadline of October 1 for a “liability shift” that, for the first time, would make merchants liable for any fraudulent charges that result from using point-of-service readers that can't read chip-and-pin EMV cards . Unfortunately, with banks no longer bearing responsibility for those charges, they haven't been in any great hurry to educate either customers or businesses about the new chip-enabled cards they've been issuing all year. \nAs a result, point-of-sale technology company Ranstad Technologies notes that 42% of business technology decision makers, including corporate executives, have either taken no action to install new card readers or don't know if their companies will hit the deadline. That cutoff date, by the way, is roughly two months away. \n“There isn’t one industry that is more prepared than the other,” says Dick Mitchell, Randstad Technologies Solutions Director. “This 42% is made up of businesses of all shapes and sizes – including good sized businesses with 100 or more sites in the retail, hospitality, restaurant, financial services industries – all of which should have a vested interest in the liability shift.” \nThey likely would, if they had any clue what that liability shift meant for their businesses. Small-business website Manta, which hosts 2.5 million businesses, conducted a survey that found 28% of small business owners don't know what EMV technology is or how it impacts their business. Used in Europe since the early 1990s, EMV cards -- which take their name from Europay/MasterCard/Visa -- contain an embedded microchip that is authenticated using a personal identification number. A reader detects the chip and asks the card user for a PIN that matches the one found on the chip. Since there isn't a magnetic stripe with all a user's data embedded, there's a far lesser chance of a chip-and-PIN user's data being stolen. 1 of 4", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T16:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T16:38:35.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
