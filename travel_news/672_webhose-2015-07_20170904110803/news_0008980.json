The hotel will be a fabulous addition to the park and will become a real destination. It’s a fantastic opportunity for us to demonstrate what we can do with existing buildings and we’re looking forward to starting the detail design and getting the building open. It’s the first of many projects we are looking at working with in collaboration with SpaceInvader Design.”\nJonathan Slater of Oddfellows Hotels, said: “We are truly excited about the process of sympathetically converting the beautiful Bruntwood Hall. As with our Chester hotel, the focus will be on restoring the building’s original features, keeping a true sense of history and incorporating the signature touch of playful design that characterises an Oddfellows hotel.\n“Tim Groom Architects and SpaceInvader designers are part of the team involved in the project. Demand has been very high for our Chester hotel and our guests are always asking if we have any other locations, so as a business, we feel this is the right time to grow and evolve. We are just thrilled to be able to add Bruntwood Hall, which will be known as Oddfellows on the Park, to the family,” he added.\nSource:-Boutique hotel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T20:37:57.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
