Forbes pegs his net worth at closer to $155 million.\nJackson had to admit he still commands top dollar for appearances, taking $100,000 for a day of filming “Spy” and $200,000 for a concert appearance last week in London.\nHe also confirmed that his 17-acre Connecticut estate has a basketball court and a nightclub — though he couldn’t remember the zip code for his 21-bedroom pad.\nIn court, Jackson tried to sweeten the jury of four women and two men by flashing big smiles.\n“You gotta smile when you’re in a public situation. If you’re crying they’re just having more fun with you,” he said.\nHe also apologised to Leviston for calling her a “motherfu*king porn star” on the video of her and boyfriend Maurice Murray.\n“I’m sorry if you feel like I hurt you,” he said looking directly at Leviston, who was seated in the audience.\nIn the tape, Jackson edited in his own narration using his alter ego “Pimpin’ Curly,” mocking Levinston’s body and calling her a “bi*ch and a “ho.”\nHe chalked the tape up to rapper competition.\n“That’s just the competitive nature of the art form,” he said.\nJackson’s lawyer, James Renard, told the jury in opening that his client’s bank account is approaching zero because of unpaid debts — which includes $1,737 owed to his grandfather.\n“That’s the current financial condition and we believe that’s very important with respect to the assessment of any damages,” Renard said.\nJackson said his shrinking finances have affected his image.\n“Now that I’ve filed for bankruptcy … I’m not as cool as I was last week,” he said.\nThis article originally appeared in the New York Post .\nOriginally published as ‘My flashy lifestyle is all fake’", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/cent-my-flashy-lifestyle-is-all-fake/story-fn907478-1227451758266", "http://pagesix.com/2015/07/21/50-cent-my-flashy-lifestyle-is-all-fake/?_ga=1.192414894.508204345.1381948382"], "published": "2015-07-22T16:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T03:33:53.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
