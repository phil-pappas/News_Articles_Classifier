What is your favorite vacation destination?\nA. Italy, because you can explore so many different regions on one trip. The options are endless between the countryside, the island of Capri, the Amalfi Coast, the city and the villages on mountaintops. Italian food is my favorite food, so that's an added bonus that makes Italy my favorite vacation destination.\nQ. What untapped destination should people know about?\nl Related Travel See all related 8 A. I'm not sure if anything is untapped these days, but I do feel like not enough people go to Bali, because it's so far away. I can say that it is worth the travel. I was intrigued by the ancient towers that are guarded by monkeys, the kind Balinese people and the landscape of the rice paddies, which are just stunning. I need to go back because 10 days wasn't enough.\nQ. What was the first trip you took as a child? And did you love it, or not so much?\nc Comments Got something to say? Start the conversation and be the first to comment. Add a comment 0 A. I traveled a lot from an early age, due to my parents being divorced. Lots of trips back and forth to Seattle to visit my dad along with annual holidays spent in Maui, which is why I never complained about visiting. My sister and I were sent to Germany every summer for six weeks to be with our grandparents from the ages of three to 18. I loved it for the most part, until I got old enough to miss my friends. But then I just invited my friends to come with me. I definitely loved it.\nQ. What's the most important thing you've learned from your travels?\nA. I've learned about people. The people I've traveled with and the people whose countries I've been fortunate enough to visit. It made me realize that I'm so small and the world is so big.\nQ. If you've ever gone away for the holidays, which was the best trip?\nA. I love being in New York for Christmas. The decorations, the snow and the holiday spirit all make the city feel so alive. I love that you're able to walk everywhere and you can't help but get caught up in all of it. I feel like you can't be a Scrooge in New York.\nQ. Where have you traveled to that most reminded you of home?\nA. I feel mostly at home in Europe and I believe that has to be because I spent so much of my youth there, exploring with my sister. I see now that it gave us such a sense of independence at an early age -- being in another world, speaking another language. I want to go back and bring my daughter and my husband to show them the places that I experienced as a kid. I feel very lucky that I had that experience. I want to give that to my daughter as much as possible.\nQ. Where would you like to go that you have never been to before?\nA. South Africa. After having visited East Africa, I wanted to go right back and see the south. Talk about being in a country and feeling small. My sister was also born in South Africa, so I feel like I have a tiny little tie to the country.\nQ. When you go away, what are some of your must-have items?\nA. Sunscreen, bug spray, dry shampoo, lip balms and a good book.\nQ. What would be your dream trip?\nA. Anything that would involve flying on a private plane and visiting at least three countries. Staying in houses where the locals are and feeling like I'm not a tourist.\nQ. What is your best vacation memory?\nA. One of my best trips was when, on a whim, I took my best friend to Thailand and flew first class with miles. We had one night in Bangkok, stayed in Chiang Mai at the Four Seasons and then went to the Amanpuri in Phuket. We got a chance to explore the city, the countryside and the coast. I am so grateful for that trip. We didn't think about it, we just went. The only thing I miss about being single is the ability to just get up and go anywhere anytime.\n(Jae-Ha Kim is a New York Times bestselling author and travel writer.
