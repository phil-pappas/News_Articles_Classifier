This is the 23rd World Scout Jamboree (WSJ); the first was held in London in 1920.\nThe World Scout Jamboree takes place every four years in a different country.\nThe theme of the 23rd WSJ is WA: a spirit of unity.\nFor 12 days, Scouts aged between 14 and 17 years will have an amazing opportunity of living and working in a multicultural environment, finding out about each other’s cultures, faiths and beliefs, sharing their own culture with others, taking part in adventurous activities and learning about global issues, amongst many other activities. It is a fantastic non-formal education opportunity for these young participants.\nBesides that, the Jamboree will be a great experience for some 7,700 adult volunteers from all over the world who will form the International Service Team (IST). They will serve in all of the 14 departments that have been set up to ensure the success of the Jamboree. The departments include human resources, guest services, ceremonies, safety, transport and programme.\nThe Jamboree programme, running from the Opening Ceremony on the evening of 29 July until the Closing Ceremony on the evening of 7 August, will consist of a wide range of structured activities as well as many informal learning opportunities.\nThe programme for young people is based around the themes of global development, peace, culture, science, community, nature and water and will involve them actively contributing to the local community in the area around the Jamboree.\nA key highlight of these Module activities is the peace programme. As 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of the atomic bombing of cities in Japan, a special Peace Memorial Ceremony will be held in Hiroshima.\nRelated Posts Chelsea Football Club Hosts Leaders Sport Summit 2013, the world’s most Prestigious Sport Business Summit The 65th Sapporo Snow Festival in Japan ends today Japan remains home to Asia’s highest expatriate packages Increased airline capacity makes Japan the fifth-largest tourism market for New Zealand Showcasing Japan at AIME 2014", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T23:41:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
