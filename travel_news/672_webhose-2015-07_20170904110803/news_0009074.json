Some said customers had a right to eat in peace, while others were sympathetic to the reality of taking a toddler out for a meal.\nAnd now the mother of the screaming girl has hit back at critics in an opinion piece published on The Washington Post .\nTara Carson said making news was the last thing she expected to do while holidaying in Maine with her young family.\nShe and her husband ate at the diner after a 30-minute wait.\n“We finally got a table and ordered food. I ordered pancakes for my daughter, which took about 40 minutes to arrive,” she wrote in the op-ed, which attracted more than 4,000 comments.\n“At this point, my 21-month-old was getting antsy, as I imagine most would when they have to sit in one place and wait for a long time. She wasn’t having a meltdown, so we decided to stay in our corner booth rather than go outside in the rain.\n“In the noisy diner I didn’t see anyone looking at us or think we were causing a disturbance. (If that had been the case, we would have gladly taken our baby outside.)”\nThe food arrived and Mrs Carson’s daughter was “still fussing”, so she and her husband tried to eat their food quickly.\n“Out of nowhere, Marcy’s Diner owner Darla Neugebauer threw to-go [takeaway] containers at my husband and yelled, ‘Either she goes or you go!’\n“We hadn’t seen this woman before and didn’t know who she was. She seemed so unprofessional that we didn’t take it seriously. Our waitress seemed embarrassed by the owner’s behaviour too.”\nMrs Carson continued to feed her daughter and a few minutes later, Ms Neugebauer pointed at the child and yelled, “You need to shut the hell up!”\n“My husband replied, ‘Are you serious? Are you really yelling at a toddler right now?’ ‘As serious as a heart attack,’ she said, with fury in her eyes.\n“What got lost is that it’s never okay to yell at a baby, especially if you own a restaurant. You should care about providing good service to their patrons. Neugebauer could have come over politely and told us our baby was disruptive. She should not have thrown things or yelled or cursed.”\nMrs Carson says she wants to train her child to behave well in public places.\n“She is a normal toddler who is funny and curious and well-behaved. Is she perfect? No. Am I a perfect parent? Certainly not. But I do know that these things happen.\n“Babies cry and sometimes mums make the call between a tantrum in the loud diner or going out into the rain.\n“As parents, we sometimes rely on the kindness and empathy of strangers, who know we’re doing the best we can. It’s compassion I try to model for my daughter. I wish others would do the same.”\nMrs Carson certainly hasn’t received much compassion on social media this week.\n“Tara Carson is a sh***y mother and a whiny entitled cultivator of future ignorance,” a commenter wrote on the Washington Post’s Facebook page.\n“I’m picturing you being self-entitled, rude, and selfish, allowing your child to cry and disturb every other patron in the place,” wrote a commenter on the Marcy’s Diner Facebook page.\nMs Neugebauer is standing by her actions and says she isn’t sorry.\n“I might have used poor judgment. I wouldn’t say I was sorry because it stopped. When things stop, it’s usually a good thing,” she told WCSH-TV .\n“Life’s full of choices and you’ve got to live with all of them,” she said. “I chose to yell at a kid. It made her shut up, which made me happy. It made my staff happy, it made the other 75 people dining here happy and they left. They may never come back, and other people may not come in — their loss, really.”\nOriginally published as Screaming kid’s mum hits back", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/food/owner-of-marcys-diner-in-portland-praised-for-yelling-at-screaming-child/story-fn93ypt9-1227451436397", "http://www.wcsh6.com/story/news/local/portland/2015/07/19/portland-diner-facebook-post/30391407/", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/parenting/wp/2015/07/21/about-that-kid-in-the-restaurant/", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/parenting/mother-of-toddler-yelled-at-by-portland-diner-owner-hits-back/story-fnet08ui-1227454056456"], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T10:51:10.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
