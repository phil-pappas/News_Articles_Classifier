Thanks to your assistance, I had a very good trip to Ladakh and Srinagar. I want to give some pointers so my experience can be helpful to some of you. To give you some background, the total trip lasted about 15 days, I flew from the USA to Delhi, overnight in Delhi, then to Leh, then saw Nubra/Pangong, monestaries, then took shared van to Srinagar and spent three days there before I flew to Delhi and then back to the USA. Some pointers/observations/tips: 1. The Sun. After reading some posts, you should know not to underestimate the Ladakh sun. It is strong! They say Morocco has a cold climate with a hot sun, and Ladakh is like that too. I took a wide-brimmed hat and it served me very well. Ditto for sunscreen. Drug Stores (Chemists) sell sun screen in Leh. Weather was actually hot during the day when the sun was up, but chilly at night and cold on the mountain passes, so bring layers. 2. Driving on mountain roads. They are bad. Bring anti-car sickness medication. It is also available in Leh. Many of the roads, especially near the mountain tops, are not paved. They are also very bumpy. I never knew how far 100 km was until I went on the roads! 3. Acclimitize. I got a bit sick the first day in Leh with headaches and shortness of breath. This was with me not doing anything other than laying around. I took some asprins for the headache (not sure how advisable this is, but I did it), and I felt better, but I still did nothing the first day. On Day 2, I went through Leh itself, and had a good time. Dont think about going on the higher mountain passes until at least day 3. 4. It is possible to combine Nubra Valley and Pongong Lake into one trip, but we did it ad hoc. I dont know if it can be pre-planned in advance. The road from Nubra to Pangong is bad, but passable. Due to melted ice, make sure you leave Nubra pretty early before going on the road to Pangong, as the roads will probably be washed out in the PM. 5. When you are in Nubra and Leh, it is not a problem to find a good hotel/guesthouse. I wouldnt go to Nubra unless you spend two nights there. It is quite far, and the drive is not easy, given the road conditions. 6. I found it impossible to find people to share a taxi to go on a monestary tour with me, so I had to absorb the vehicle cost myself. Not a huge deal, but these tours do not seem advertised by the many travel agents. 7. I found Old Srinagar safe and less hassles from touts and shop keepers than the main tourist areas of Srinagar, being the lake area and gardens. As you know, if you dont know much about carpets, dont buy one unless you simply like the look of it for the price. The shop keepers know more about carpets than you do, unless you are an expert in carpets. 8. The people in Ladakh are very friendly. It is truly a nice place to visit, and you will enjoy your stay there. 9. Wifi is available but it is tempermental and does not work all the time. Same for ISD phone service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T21:19:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
