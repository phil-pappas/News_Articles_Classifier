It’s a bulging disc and we’ve treated that.”\nOtten has not played since August 10 last year, when he was forced to have knee reconstructive surgery. His return to the Adelaide AFL selection mix — while Milburn has novices Jake Lever, Kyle Hartigan and Sam Shaw hold up the Crows defence — only enhances the prospect of interim coach Scott Camporeale building a genuine contender to September when defence counts most.\nAt 9-6, Adelaide is in total control of its destiny to end a two-season absence from the finals. The equation to September appears to demand the Crows win at least four of its remaining six home-and-away games — and the most challenging are those against Sydney (SCG), Richmond (Adelaide Oval), West Coast (Oval) and in round 23 against Geelong (Kardinia Park).\nThe question of how Adelaide would cope amid the Walsh tragedy appears answered — and a strong point for considering Camporeale as a contender for the coaching vacancy at West Lakes.\n“And that’s been driven by the attitude of the players,” Milburn said yesterday. “That attitude has been especially strong at training — they are working hard.”\nCamporeale notes his players have not lost their determination to play in finals — and maximum numbers in training and selection is holding up standards at West Lakes.\n“What pleases me the most is the resilience of the group,” Camporeale said while praising the professionalism of his players.\n“We’ve just got to try to keep winning to make sure we earn the right to be there at the end of the year. There’s something pretty tasty at the end of the year for them if they want it — that’s what we’re driving for … they want to do something special.\n“We’re in total control (of our destiny]). And we’ve got guys coming back. There’s competition for spots.”\nTHE BIG EQUATION\nADELAIDE’S equation to an AFL finals berth has a return to September guaranteed with four wins from six games.\nThe run home — Sydney (away), Richmond (home), Essendon (away), Brisbane (home), West Coast (home) and Geelong (away) — has four decisive games.\nSYDNEY (SCG)\nNot played this year. Crows have lost past three games to Swans — but won past four against Sydney at SCG.\nRICHMOND (OVAL)\nNot played this year. Crows lost past two to Tigers — including game that cost Brenton Sanderson his security at Adelaide Oval last year.\nWEST COAST (OVAL)\nMet in Round 15, Crows’ first game after Phil Walsh’s death — and lost by 56 points. Lost past two to Eagles.\nGEELONG (KARDINIA)\nGame in Round 14 cancelled as Crows mourned Phil Walsh’s death. Crows last won at Geelong in 2003.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T15:35:06.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
