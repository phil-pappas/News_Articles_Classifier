Some flyers don’t want to be over the wing, and still others hate the bulkhead seats (located by the wall or screen that divides the flight classes).\nI prefer a window seat for sleeping on long flights and the aisle seat on shorter flights or when the configuration is three seats on each side of an aisle. It can be difficult, however, to find the best seat on the plane if seats are blocked for crews, priority seating is restricted to only V. I. P members, or the plane is simply too full.\nWhile you can’t always score your preferred seat, you can increase your chances of not being stuck in a middle seat in the back of the plane by educating yourself about the tools available and being persistent.\nGetting the best possible seat begins with using the tools available. Sites like Seat Guru , Seat Expert , and Seat Maestro provide seat maps, pitch/leg room dimensions, available amenities such as power and audio/visual, seat recline and arm rest data, location of wash rooms/galley and advice on selecting a seat.\nOnce you’ve decided on which seats you prefer, you can then start the process of securing them.\n• Select a seat, then set up a free seat alert\nIt sounds obvious, but some people skip over this step. Usually when you’re purchasing your ticket, the most seats are available, so this is the time to take advantage of the selection. If you’re travelling with other people and want to sit together, this is a good time to select those seats.\nIf you can’t select the seats you prefer, you can set up a seat alert using this great tool found on Expert Flyer . You can select the seat you’d like to acquire and then set up a seat alert for free. They will email you when/if your desired seat opens up. You can set up multiple seat alerts with a paid subscription, but there is no charge for a single seat alert.

If you do not have V.I.P. status with the airline (such as Gold membership with Qantas or Virgin Australia), you may not be able to view the available premium seats. Or it could be that there actually are no seats available.\nDon’t wait until you get to the airport to be assigned a seat. Go into your reservation on a periodic basis to see if seats open up — they usually do. If you are still unable to select a seat, call the airline.\nIf they cannot assign you a seat, check in for your flight as soon as it is available online and you may then be able to select a seat. If there are still no seats available to you, be sure to arrive at the airport early. If premium seats are the only seats available, you’ll be assigned one of those and they won’t charge you extra!\nThe ultimate seat — business class. We wish.

I am a frequent traveller and I admit that it has happened to me. Occasionally, airlines change planes and when they do, your seat assignments may be adjusted.\nFamilies and travelling companions get split up. You can go from an aisle to a middle seat in the back of the plane. Check your reservations and seat assignments frequently.\n*Pro tip: if you receive a notice that flight numbers, times or anything else has changed, use these notices as reminders to check your seat assignments.\nYes, you have a lot on your mind when travelling, but this is such a critical element for the quality of your trip. You don’t need this type of surprise when you board.\n• It’s never too late\nBeginning about five days out from departure, V.I.P. travellers will start getting upgraded and their seats will start to open up. In addition, passengers may change their schedule or cancel.\nThis is the time when it pays to start checking your reservation frequently for better seat opportunities. Closer to departure, there will be no-shows, missed connections and blocked seats released. Some airlines even allow you to change your seat after you’ve checked in, so don’t give up.\nYour last chance to get a better seat is the gate agent. Be polite, smile, ask if any better seats have opened up and let them know your preference. You may be pleasantly surprised.\n• Volunteer your way to an upgraded seat\nThe days of getting an upgraded seat by simply smiling and dressing well have all but disappeared. If you have an undesirable seat because the flight is too full, however, and your schedule is flexible, you may be able to volunteer your way to an upgrade.\nIf the flight is oversold and they need your seat, you’ll receive the appropriate voucher, amenities and placement on the next flight. Because you’re volunteering, many times they’ll give you a better seat or upgrade on the next flight.\nMake sure you ask them to do this, however — it’s not automatic.\nThis story originally appeared on TheFrugalTravelGuy.com .\nOriginally published as How to get the best airline seat", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/03/1227426/505751-bf97d172-2071-11e5-97a8-3165311c9b30.jpg", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content6.video.news.com.au/k0NzUwdjpo8EBIQ17_-UC7g-VysKP6pe/promo260091843&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://www.frugaltravelguy.com/2015/06/how-to-get-the-best-possible-seat-on-the-plane.html", "http://www.seatguru.com/", "http://www.expertflyer.com/", "http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/how-to-get-the-best-seat-on-the-plane/story-fn6yjmoc-1227426504819", "http://www.seatmaestro.com/", "http://seatexpert.com/"], "published": "2015-07-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T09:47:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
