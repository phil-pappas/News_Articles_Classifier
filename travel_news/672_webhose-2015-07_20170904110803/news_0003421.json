Byrne’s care factor looks like it went from zero to 100. And for what it’s worth, we reckon the razzle-dazzle easily beats the daggy, no matter how much more effort it takes.\nRose Byrne ... in 2001 at the premiere of Lord of the Rings in Sydney and looking red hot at the Tony Awards last month.

So to mark Byrne’s birthday, here’s a flashback to some golden oldies of other Aussie A-listers who with age, some style rescue and possibly a little surgery, have utterly changed their looks.\nWOULD YOU RECOGNISE THEM? Tell us below.\nJennifer Hawkins\nJennifer Hawkins ... at the Miss Universe 2004 contest in Quito, Ecuador and smouldering at this year’s Logie Awards. Pictures: AFP/Getty. Source: Supplied\nBefore Hawkins and her rocking bod shot to fame, she was still a deadset cutie. Just look at that sweet smile. As for her style — well it’s by no means Vogue -worthy, but we can just blame that on the fashion of the early 2000s with its so-tiny-it-could-be-a-belt skirts.\nShane Warne\nShane Warne ... striking a pose at the Laureus World Sports Awards in 2006 and after his Liz Hurley makeover on the red carpet in 2012. Pictures: Getty. Source: Supplied\nPursed lips, blonde tips, and a slightly podgier frame. Warne was always a “thirsty” one, but seems he might be downing lo-carb brews now instead.\nNicole Kidman\nNicole Kidman ... Frizzing out a photo shoot on a park bench after BMX Bandit’s release in 1983, and in sleek form at the Women In Film 2015 Crystal and Lucy Awards last month. Pictures: Getty.

And at 48, she is still a total babe.\nJessica Mauboy\nJessica Mauboy ... with Damien Leith, at the 2006 Australian Idol grand final, and oh-so chic at an Australian Fashion Chamber event in May. Pictures: Getty. Source: Supplied\nNow looking smoking hot, Aussie songstress Mauboy has clearly learnt a thing or two since dressing like a birthday present. And we hope she has ditched those violet cut-off leggings.\nIggy Azalea\nIggy Azalea ... at Perez Hilton's One Night In LA Benefiting VH1 Save The Music in 2012, and looking decidedly more chic and fresh-faced at the Billboard Music Awards in May.

Arriving at the 2001 Moulin Rouge premiere in New York City and serving matinee idol realness at the Paper Towns premiere in New York this week. Pictures: AAP/Getty. Source: Supplied\nThe blue steel pose might have been on point, but seriously, Baz. That wispy hairdo is not okay, and certainly not in 2001. We’re loving the sleeker look.\nDannii Minogue\nDannii Minogue ... Rocking skunk hair at Sydney’s People’s Choice Awards in 1992 and bringing a touch of glamour to the Logies this year. Pictures: Getty. Source: Supplied\nMinogue has always been a beauty, but she used to sport a slightly fully figure and a two-toned mane we prefer to forget.\nGuy Sebastian\nGuy Sebastian ... At the 2004 MTV Asia Awards in Singapore and rocking a much more stylish look at the opening of Eurovision in May. Pictures: Getty. Source: Supplied\nIt was tough for fans to say goodbye to that adorable fro. But all good things must come to an end, so we don’t hold it against this loveable local talent.\nDaniel Macpherson\nDaniel Macpherson ... At the Logie’s a decade ago, and at the InStyle and Huge Boss Men of Style party in September last year after having burnt that heinous skull tie. Pictures: Getty. Source: Supplied\nLet’s get something straight: that look on the left is only passable if you are a 14-year-old goth who thinks Fall Out Boy is the ultimate in punk-rock. Otherwise, studded belts and skull ties should be banished. Macpherson, we love your style now, and don’t ever look back. Please.\nRicki-Lee Coulter\nRicki-Lee Coulter...

The brunette bombshell now keeps her toned tummy covered at black tie events.\nGyton Grantley Gyton Grantley... at the premiere of Under The Radar in 2004 and scrubbed up for the Melbourne premiere of Strictly Ballroom The Musical in January.
