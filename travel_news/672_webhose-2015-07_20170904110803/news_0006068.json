The Airports Commission earlier this month advised the Government that another Heathrow runway was the “best answer” to tackling the country’s aviation capacity crisis , but added that airport expansion should only be allowed if it is accompanied by a package of strict measures to reduce the noise and air pollution that would blight local communities. Those measures included a prohibition on scheduled flights between 11.30pm and 6am, and legislation that would rule out a fourth runway in the future. John Holland-Kaye, the boss of the west London airport, said that some of the conditions recommended by the commission “are beyond our control, some of them we need to discuss with our airlines, who are important customers, some we need to discuss with Government itself”. He added: “There’s some things like night flights and a fourth runway, we need to assess those a little bit more carefully”. The airport would “clarify” its position on the conditions “at a later stage”, he said. Last week, Mr Holland-Kaye suggested the commission may have failed to take into account some of the steps Heathrow has already taken to address environmental concerns when it decided on the mitigation measures. He was speaking just hours after environmental activists caused disruption to flights at Heathrow by storming onto its northern runway and chaining themselves together, in protest at the proposed expansion of the airport. The chief executive insisted that Heathrow’s “security systems worked” during the incident and ensured the airport was able to minimise the disruption, but would not comment on the financial hit it would take. The protest overshadowed another strong set of traffic figures from Heathrow that showed it was a record June for the airport, with 6.68m passengers passing through the hub.
