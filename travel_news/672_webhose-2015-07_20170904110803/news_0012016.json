A 20-year-old woman died on Monday after suffering similar injuries when colored powder sprayed from a stage caught fire at the party on Saturday night.\nThe report said Liu had been a design student at the College of Maritime Technology in Taiwan's capital, Taipei.\nInvestigators are looking into whether a spark might have triggered the explosion of colored corn powder thrown into the dancing crowd at the Formosa Water Park along the island's west coast on the outskirts of Taipei.\nAmong the injured was Alex Haas , 26, of New Hampshire in the United States, who also suffered burns to his lungs and over 90 percent of his body.\nTaiwan has since banned the use of flammable powders at all public activities.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T13:07:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
