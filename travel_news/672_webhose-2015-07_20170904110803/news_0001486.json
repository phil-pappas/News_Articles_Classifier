Ten of those flights were on the same stormy day at Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston.\nHawaiian Airlines, Alaska Airlines and Delta Air Lines had the best on-time ratings, while Spirit Airlines had the worst. Nearly two of every five Spirit flights arrived at least 15 minutes behind schedule, and the low-cost airline was chronically late for two straight months on four routes to or from Dallas.\nSpirit also had the highest complaint rate among the 14 airlines covered in the report, followed by Frontier Airlines.\nEnvoy Air, which operates many American Eagle regional flights, cancelled 3.7 per cent of its flights, the highest rate among the reporting airlines.\n___\nThe full report can be found at http://1.usa.gov/1KPP13Y\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T17:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T22:40:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
