Thirty-one young men and women, participating in this heartfelt project come together from across the United States. They arrived in Moberly Saturday evening, tired, hungry for a home-cooked meal, and ready for a shower! This year the “Bike and Build” participants left from New Haven, Connecticut, on June 11, and will end their journey in Half Moon Bay, California, on August 24. By the time they reach California they will have ridden over 4,000 miles. They stop about once per week for a “Build Day” in various towns across the U.S. Their last build day was in Springfield, IL. Their next build day would be in Lawrence, KS. Each day starts at 4:30 a.m. with breakfast a priority. They begin packing the trailer with sleeping bags and coolers, and then they have a route meeting, which includes the projected mileage for the day. The bikers drink a lot of water and Gatorade and on days of riding 90 miles or more (or real hot days), they stop for two lunch breaks. The bikers said Saturday was the hottest day they had experienced since they left on June 11 from Connecticut. They arrived just in time to be engulfed with Missouri heat and humidity! The past several years I have conducted a short interview with several participants, but this year I was out town when Bike and Built visited Moberly. Sunday afternoon on my way to Kansas City with my husband and granddaughters in tow, we counted at least 19 bikers heading east on Highway 10 between Carrollton and Norborne. I told them of my visits with Bike and Build participants in the past and was surprised to see riders from Bike and Build actually on the move. Monday, around 11 a.m. I visited the Farmer’s Market in Kansas City with my family. Just as we exited a building, I saw several bikers peddle by and when two stopped my youngest granddaughter and I took the opportunity to walk over and ask where they had been and where were they were going. Margaret Giesel of Louisville, Connecticut and Anna Navin of Chicago, Illinois graciously stopped long enough for a photo and smiled as they pulled out an itinerary that showed they stayed at First Christian Church in Moberly before heading east! They said Kansas City was just about the halfway (2,000 miles) mark in their travel to Half Moon Bay, California. Hopefully they will get a break from the intense heat as they travel west.
