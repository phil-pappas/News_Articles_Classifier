There will be no raise in price for season passes, ten time powder pass or day use lift tickets for the upcoming season. Pass holders who purchase on or before July 31 will receive bonus powder cache pre-loaded on their pass which can be spent at the resort like a debit card at any resort retail or food and beverage outlet. Season passes will remain at a discounted price until October 31 but will not include the Powder Cache bonus after July 31. \nThe resort will also be offering exclusive unpublished discounted room rates at the Hotel Alyeska throughout the year for pass holders to enjoy. As well, another major benefit is unlimited tram access during the summer and fall. \n\"Despite having the most snowfall in North America, Mother Nature didn’t deliver the goods that many were hoping for this past winter and we are sensitive to our loyal customers desire to get more value out of their experience” explains Eric Fullerton, Director of Marketing. “We are exploring many different ways to enhance the availability and safety of the terrain on the mountain for this coming season. In the recent past, we have invested significant capital to improve the access on our mountain while enhancing the experience for our guests with events, concerts, and programs for all levels of skiers and riders.” The resort is currently aiming for an opening date of Thursday, November 26 for the general public which will be based on early-season snowpack and conditions. Season pass holders get first tracks on the mountain the day before with the annual Season Passholder Appreciation Day currently slated for Wednesday, November 25. The annual event is a much appreciated day of exclusive skiing and riding for the Passholder community only. \nThe day is capped off that evening at the Sitzmark Bar & Grill with ski and snowboarding films, good food and lots of fun. Season Passes and powder passes can be purchased on our website or the tram ticket office 7 days a week or by calling 800.880.3880. \n\nAbout Alyeska Resort ( www.AlyeskaResort.com ) Alyeska Resort is Alaska's premier year-round destination featuring The Hotel Alyeska, an award-winning 302 room full-service property.
