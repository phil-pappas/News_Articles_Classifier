A decade ago, this beach was a sandbar. Hurricane Wilma in 2005 pushed the sand to the southern end of the sandbar, connecting it to the mainland. The park is popular with locals for its split personality. On one side of the lagoon, you pay $8 to park and come to a well-kept park with changing rooms, snack bar, picnic tables, playground and a concession stand that rents kayaks and stand-up paddleboards. On the other side of the lagoon, a wild sand spit extends three miles north, a beach with soft white sand, scads of shells and so many shore birds that it's a stop on the Great Florida Birding Trail. \nBut the adventure is crossing the lagoon itself. It's about 50 yards across and at high tide, the water comes up to about your waist or chest. The bottom of the lagoon is a squishy, grassy sand. You don't sink, but you do have to overcome the \"yuck\" factor. If that's not your idea of fun, you can walk about 20 minutes around the lagoon to the south to reach the beach. \nSan Carlos Bay/Bunche Beach \n18201 John Morris Road, Fort Myers; 239-707-0584 \nJust before you reach the causeway to Sanibel Island on Summerlin Road/SR869 in Fort Myers, a road leads out to San Carlos Bay and wild Bunche Beach, a Lee County park. This natural tidal wetlands area includes a sandy beach, mangroves and salt flats, all preserved in a natural state. It's a good place to launch a kayak. Bring your own or there's an outfitter that rents them, too. The beach is very shallow with a slightly muddy bottom (it's on a bay, not the Gulf) but at low tide, the receding water exposes broad sandbars and tidal pools where you can hunt for sea stars, shells and crabs. Nature lovers enjoy the birds and everyone loves the sunsets. There are 100 parking places; parking is $2 an hour. \nDog Beach \n8800 Estero Blvd., Fort Myers Beach; 239-707-1874 \nPeople want a beach where they aren't near other people. Dogs? They just want to be with dogs. This hidden beach is for dog owners or people who like seeing dogs have a good time. Dog Beach is free and has minimal facilities. It has a doggie shower, but only a portable toilet. The best time to visit is an hour before low tide when the water is shallow for a long way out and sand bars are exposed. At high tide, there may be only a fringe of sand exposed and you may have to wade through shallow water to reach the beach. The park can get busy, but it's a fun mix of dogs, kids, adults and boats. \nBonnie Gross offers tips on visiting the natural and authentic Florida at FloridaRambler.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T20:02:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
