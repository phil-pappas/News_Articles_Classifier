Castor had exhibited a slow decline in the mobility of his back legs for the last six years, due to arthritis. Zoo staff provided Castor outstanding care through a variety of methods, including a treatment plan of physical therapy, pain medication and even acupuncture. Although these efforts prolonged his quality of life, this week he showed severe difficulty moving his back legs causing animal care and veterinary staff to make the difficult decision to humanely euthanize him on the morning of Thursday, July 8 at Denver Zoo. Castor was one of the ten oldest Komodo dragons in North American zoos. \n\"Castor was a remarkable animal and he will be missed. Although this is never an easy decision, it was the right one. We'll all miss him very much, but we're glad he lived such a long, happy life here at the zoo. It was just his time,\" says Denver Zoo Sr. Vice President of Animal Care & Conservation Brian Aucone. \nCastor began showing signs of arthritis in his rear legs in 2009. Over the years, staff mitigated his pain through medications. In November 2013, he began regular physical therapy treatments with a local animal therapist. Last month, staff also introduced acupuncture. He initially responded well to all of his treatments and veterinarians kept a close eye on his condition with regular radiographs on his joints. \nCastor was born on February 2, 1994 at the Cincinnati Zoo and arrived at Denver Zoo in July of the same year. He was an offspring of Naga, a Komodo dragon given to former president George H.W. Bush as a gift from the president of Indonesia, and among only the second clutch of eggs to successfully hatch in the United States. He then sired two clutches of his own, resulting in seven dragons. \nDenver Zoo is home to three other Komodo dragons, females Kristika and Anika, and Castor's 12-year-old son, Raja. \nAbout Denver Zoo: Denver Zoo brings education alive, providing a unique learning experience that sparks an interest in the natural world for visitors and program participants alike.
