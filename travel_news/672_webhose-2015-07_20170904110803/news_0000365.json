Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris 14 July 2015 03:00 AM\nFrance international Lloris, who joined Spurs from Lyon in 2012, is the club's number one goalkeeper but has been linked with a move to Manchester United this summer.\nA statement from Tottenham read: \"The club can confirm that Hugo Lloris has sustained a fractured wrist during the close season period.\n\"The France goalkeeper will continue to work alongside the first-team squad to build up his fitness in a bid to be ready for the start of the season.\nMeanwhile, Celtic defender Mikael Lustig is hopeful he will be ready for the Champions League opener against Stjarnan following a long injury lay-off.\nThe Swede's season ended on February 7 after suffering an ankle injury but he has played in all three of Celtic's friendlies ahead of the second qualifying round first leg against the Icelandic side at Parkhead tomorrow.\nLustig is almost certain to start following the exit of fellow right-back Adam Matthews to Sunderland with new signing Saidy Janko still getting up to speed.\nLustig said: \"Fitness-wise I would lie if I said I'm in the best shape of my life but it's getting better. It's important that I've played in three games now and hopefully on Wednesday I'm going to be ready.\n\"Hopefully there will competition for places. Both me and Adam Matthews did well together but the main thing for me now is to try to stay fit for the season and if I'm fit I'm sure I'll be able to start.\"\nends\ntottenham hotspur", "external_links": ["http://www.independent.ie/incoming/article31374884.ece/16116/ALTERNATES/w620/SOCCER%20Totte_9.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-14T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T11:04:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
