It fits completely,” said Prof Pattiaratchi.\n“Most likely other wreckage will be coming through the whole region of Reunion and Madagascar in coming weeks.”\nThe Indian Ocean gyre is an ocean-wide spiral of current driven by surface winds, and capable of carrying objects thousands of kilometres.\nThe current moves at about 3.5 kilometres an hour, or almost 500 kilometres a week but not in a straight line.\nIn the case of MH370 debris, it is possible any wreckage was carried many thousands of kilometres around the ocean before reaching Reunion Island.\nHowever Dr Erik van Sebille from London’s Imperial College said it was also possible no further debris would be found on the island.\n“Debris from MH370 would be extremely dispersed by now, washed away into a bigger and bigger cloud,” said Dr van Sebille. Unlocking the mystery ... Reunion Island is 942 kilometres east of Madagascar. Picture: Supplied. Source: Supplied\n“I would expect the debris field is now hundreds of kilometres in diameter, which makes it very unlikely another piece of debris would end up on the same beach, probably not even the same island.”\nHe said a good demonstration of ocean currents was provided by a container of rubber duckies lost in the north Pacific in 1992.\n“It contained 28,000 rubber duckies and in the years afterwards and actually even today, these rubber duckies are found everywhere on every beach in the Pacific, from Alaska to Australia,” said Dr van Sebille.\n“But of the 28,000 only 300 and something have been found on beaches so the vast majority are still floating in the ocean, or on the bottom of the ocean, or on a beach where they haven’t been found yet.”\nProf Pattiaratchi said if it was proved the flaperon was from MH370, as he believed it would, the discovery would put to bed some of the conspiracy theories relating to the missing plane.\n“It’s another piece of the jigsaw. There’s still a long way to go,” he said.\n ", "external_links": ["http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/do-ocean-currents-hold-the-key-to-unlocking-the-mh370-mystery/story-fnizu68q-1227463861847?sv=4c54401ec9e04146f8fc784b94931c07&title=Could+ocean+currents+unlock+mystery%3F", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/do-ocean-currents-hold-the-key-to-unlocking-the-mh370-mystery/story-fnizu68q-1227463861847?sv=4c54401ec9e04146f8fc784b94931c07", "http://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/news-networkeditorial/multitools/slider/default/nca-slide-m.js", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/do-ocean-currents-hold-the-key-to-unlocking-the-mh370-mystery/story-fnizu68q-1227463861847?sv=4c54401ec9e04146f8fc784b94931c07&title=Could+ocean+currents+unlock+mystery%3F", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/do-ocean-currents-hold-the-key-to-unlocking-the-mh370-mystery/story-fnizu68q-1227463861847?sv=4c54401ec9e04146f8fc784b94931c07&h=Could+ocean+currents+unlock+mystery%3F", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/mh370-all-your-questions-answered/story-fntzoymh-1227463817740?login=1&memtype=anonymous", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Could+ocean+currents+unlock+mystery%3F&c=EXPERTS+believe+Indian+Ocean+currents+have+made+it+highly+likely+an+aircraft+part+washed+on+to+the+beach+of+remote+Reunion+Island%2C+was+from+MH370.&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/do-ocean-currents-hold-the-key-to-unlocking-the-mh370-mystery/story-fnizu68q-1227463861847?sv=4c54401ec9e04146f8fc784b94931c07", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/do-ocean-currents-hold-the-key-to-unlocking-the-mh370-mystery/story-fnizu68q-1227463861847?sv=4c54401ec9e04146f8fc784b94931c07", "http://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/news-networkeditorial/multitools/slider/default/nca-slide-d.js"], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T04:06:50.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
