Founded in the seventh century by the Colhua people and later conquered by the Mexica, the “place of coyotes” retains its small-town charm. With its narrow, cobbled streets, colonial churches, vibrant markets, world-class museums and sidewalk cafes, its historic center is a popular destination for residents and tourists alike.\nHere are a few highlights, all within walking distance of one another.\nJardín Centenario, Jardín Hidalgo and San Juan Bautista Cathedral The former atrium of the San Juan Bautista Cathedral is now the lovely Jardín Centenario, a plaza with formal gardens surrounding a fountain where two coyotes appear to play in the water. Across the street is the cathedral, dating to the early 1500s and one of the oldest in Mexico City, although it has seen numerous modifications throughout its history.\nThe adjacent Jardín Hidalgo is known for its beautiful French kiosk and the Casa de Cortés, which is now a government building. On weekends and evenings, the plaza is packed with visitors, and it’s the hub of activities during the annual independence day celebrations on Sept. 15.\nMuseums Coyoacán is home to a variety of museums, from the National Watercolor Museum — the first museum in the world dedicated solely to this art form — to the Trotsky House. The standout is the Frida Kahlo Museum, also known as the Blue House, where the famous painter was born.\nThe house looks like it did when Kahlo and husband Diego Rivera lived there, offering a window to their everyday lives. On display are a few pieces by the painters as well as collections of Mexican folk art, pre-Hispanic artifacts, Kahlo’s personal art collection and working studio, and items such as photographs, books, clothes and jewelry.\nA few blocks away, and worth visiting, is the Museo Nacional de Culturas Populares. It showcases the diversity of artistic and cultural expressions of the many peoples of Mexico and hosts a number of temporary exhibits.\nFood and drink Traditional cantina La Coyoacana is an absolute must visit. Stop by midday for a cold beer and an inexpensive bite from a classic cantina menu. The patio is lush and cozy, but it can be boisterous during peak hours.\nNext door, the food market buzzes all day with stalls selling tacos, tortas, sopes and more. It’s especially popular at night.\nFor something more sophisticated, Los Danzantes serves contemporary Mexican cuisine paired with an outstanding selection of mezcal (the owners produce Los Nahuales and Alipús mezcal) and an impressive 100-percent-Mexican wine list.\nFor a more informal experience, try sibling Corazón de Maguey, directly across Jardín Centenario, where you’ll find upscale antojitos, mezcal cocktails and artisanal beer. Both restaurants feature sidewalk tables facing the plaza as well as intimate indoor seating.\nIf you need your java fix, a visit to Cafe El Jarocho is traditional, and if you’re looking for something different, try the excellent organic teas and desserts at Cafe Ruta de la Seda. And don’t miss an ice cream cone from the legendary Helados Siberia, where you can find unusual tropical fruit flavors.\nMarkets A visit to Coyoacán is not complete without a stop at the market. Neighborhood residents and visitors stroll the crowded aisles shopping for fruits and vegetables, meats and cheeses, housewares, piñatas, fresh flowers, fresh roasted coffee and pottery.\nFor a larger selection of traditional handcrafts, try the Bazar Artesanal Mexicano, where you’ll find jewelry, pottery, wood carvings, indigenous textiles and much more.\nClaudia Alarcón is a freelance writer in Austin.\nWhen you go Virtualtourist.com has a good guide to Coyoacán.
