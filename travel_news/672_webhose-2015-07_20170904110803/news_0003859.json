Last year’s show saw the highest number of independent Association planners from individual associations and societies, up 12% on 2013.”\nMr Thomas Jordan, Chief of Staff, International Union of Police Associations, United States commented, “The show created so many opportunities in 3 short days to get things rolling for us on many levels. Relationship building, meeting topics that we had not previously thought of and destinations we hadn’t even considered.”\nAssociation Hosted Buyers are invited to apply to join the club at ibtm world, which last year welcomed members from over 20 countries including US, China, UK, Canada, Russia, Switzerland, Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and France.\nBarnett continues, “Whilst Association Planners will continue to benefit from education tailored towards their job roles and business requirements, they will also have the flexibility to attend any of the ibtm world Knowledge Programme, which will cover a wide variety of topics suitable to any event professional.\n“Further to this, they will benefit from a personalised diary of pre-scheduled appointments with a choice from 3,000 international industry suppliers and leading destinations, exclusive access to Hosted Buyer lounges on the show floor with complimentary refreshments, lunch and Wi-Fi and complimentary travel and 4/5* dedicated accommodation, which is shared with other members of My Association Club.”\nJeton Iseni, European Project Manager, European Huntington’s Disease Network who attended the show last year commented, “I am very pleased with the new flexibility for Association Buyers, especially around our appointments diary. The difference is that it has given us a great opportunity and time to meet with others in the industry, share knowledge and network.”\nRelated Posts HBAA – Treat yourself in Trinity’s charity auction Chelsea Football Club Hosts Leaders Sport Summit 2013, the world’s most Prestigious Sport Business Summit Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium IBTM World Contributes To Success Of Leading International Meetings Destinations Hosted Buyer applications are open for ibtm world 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T20:08:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
