HAVE YOUR SAY BELOW\nAnd it was probably a good idea to issue boundary umpires with whistles in 1955, replacing the white handkerchiefs they had used previously.\nSince 1990 we have had just four years without a new rule or change in interpretation.\nHere are some of the biggest changes, with our assessment of whether they were a good idea or not. Stefan Martin and Todd Goldstein battle for a hitout. Picture: Mark Calleja Source: News Corp Australia\nTICK OR CROSS? KEY RULE CHANGES SINCE 1990.\n1990: Player awarded free again given option of kick or handpass (in 1988, players were obliged to kick only). TICK - a good change to allow players to not only move the ball on quicker but also allow to retain possession easier.\n1994: Playing time for a quarter amended to 20 minutes plus time-on instead of 25 minutes plus time-on. TICK - we’re once again talking about game length but this was a timely reduction.\nIntroduction of third field umpire. TICK - nothing wrong with having more eyes on the play.\nIntroduction of third interchange player. TICK - Can’t believe it took this long in the first place.\n1995: Tripping by hand becomes reportable. Tripping by foot remains reportable. TICK - was briefly repealed before reinstated. An obvious move given tripping by foot is reportable.\n1996: Protected area around player taking set disposal from free or mark changed from 10-metre semi-circle to five-metre corridor on either side. TICK - another good move to allow the easier flow of play.\nAmendment in the interpretation of the holding ball law. If player has had a prior opportunity to dispose, he must kick or handball immediately once tackled. TICK - constant tinkering has made his a modern-day issue but the general idea remains a positive.\n1997: Repeated abusive language to an umpire incurred a free plus 50-metre penalty. The offence was no longer necessarily reportable. TICK - umpire’s should be respected.\n1998: Introduction of fourth interchange player. TICK - as we said before, can’t believe it took this long. Excessive arguing with an umpire can lead to a 50m penalty. Picture: Darren England Source: News Corp Australia\n2000: Fifty-metre penalty automatically imposed on a player when reported for an offence. (Rescinded after Round 17.) CROSS - obviously a bad move and correctly repealed.\n2002: Minimum distance of ball travel for a mark increased from 10 metres to 15. TICK - a positive but one which can be pretty fuzzy depending on the umpire.\n2003: Play-on to be called if a player unnecessarily delays disposal after mark or free. TICK - improves the flow of the game and stops time wasting.\nShepherding at centre bounce ruck contests outlawed. TICK - of course both ruckmen should be given equal chance to contest the ball.\nPlayer catching ball from centre or field bounce or throw-in to be deemed to have had prior opportunity to dispose of it. TICK - helps cut down on stoppages.\n2005: Introduction of a 10-metre diameter outer circle, where ruckmen must be positioned at centre bounces. TICK - after a spat of knee injuries. A positive player welfare move.\n2006: Removal of the requirement of a player kicking in after the scoring of a behind to wait until the goal umpire completes waving the flag. The kick-in can occur as soon as the goal umpire signals the score as a behind. TICK - helps speed up the game and has seen a rise in counter-attack footy.\nAllowance of a set shot at goal from a mark or free awarded within the goalsquare to be taken from directly in front. TICK - a common sense move that rewards players for taking marks in the goalsquare rather than putting them on impossible angles.\n2007: Introduction into official laws of the game of an automatic free kick to a player with his head over the ball if any high contact made in any way. This also became an automatic reportable offence. TICK - can cause a bit of frustration but the head is sacrosanct these days.\n2008: Interchange rule violation penalised with a free kick against the offending team, 50 metres forward of the centre circle (introduced mid-season). CROSS - a reactionary rule change that rarely has an impact on the game and recent instances have proven to be errors by umpires.\n2009: Umpires empowered to recall an errant bounce at a stoppage and replace it with a throw-up. TICK - another obvious change that helps players and umpires alike.\nA player in possession of the ball, when the play is stopped for stretcher usage, to retain it when the game restarts. TICK - pretty obvious when you think about it.\nIf an umpire impedes a player when setting the mark for a shot at goal, play to be stopped and the mark to be re-set to avoid a disadvantage. TICK - another obvious one although one that might frustrate opposition fans. The interchange violation rule hasn’t been one of the AFL’s best idea. Picture: Phil Hillyard Source: News Corp Australia\n2011: Interchange: three interchange plus one substitute. CROSS - a worthy experiment that simply hasn’t worked and is widely hated by the playing group and fans. Set to be repealed at the end of the season.\nThe infringed player, rather than an umpire, given the power to determine the advantage rule. TICK - players should always have the option to play on or not.\nA player who elects to apply a bump in any situation will become liable if he makes forceful contact with the head, unless: the player was contesting the ball and did not have a realistic alternative way to contest the ball; or the contact was caused by circumstances outside the control of the player which could not be reasonably foreseen . TICK - as we’ve said, the head is sacrosanct these days.\nEmergency field umpire empowered to award prohibited contact free kicks from interchange bench. TICK - rarely used rule thankfully, but a positive move.\nStricter interpretation placed on deliberate out of bounds rule to focus on less benefit of doubt for the player who has the ball and walks over the boundary line. CROSS - fans especially detest the deliberate out of bounds rule. It hasn’t stopped players using the boundary line as a defensive strategy.\n2012: Goal line technology introduced to assist goal umpiring decisions. TICK - Duh!\n2013: A free kick to be awarded against any player who makes forceful contact below the knees of an opponent (does not apply to smothers with the hands or arms). TICK - another positive move for player welfare after Gary Rohan horrific leg injury.\nSeparation of ruckmen at stoppages, with no contact permitted until the ball has left the umpire’s hand. CROSS - pretty pointless really. The ruckmen are engaged a split second later anyway.\n2014: A player electing to bump will be cited for rough conduct if contact comes via a head clash. Players to be instructed a head clash should be reasonably foreseen when bumping. TICK - introduced after Lindsay Thomas-Ben Reid head clash to bolster the existing high bump rule.\nOriginally published as Tick or Cross: recent rule changes", "external_links": ["http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/29/1227461/703050-b897646c-35a4-11e5-b520-2768cb446c97.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/29/1227461/700858-648f2d0a-35a4-11e5-b520-2768cb446c97.jpg", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/afl-2015-we-run-the-rule-over-the-various-rule-changes-since-1990/story-fni5f22o-1227461701856", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/29/1227461/700927-88765874-35a4-11e5-b520-2768cb446c97.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-29T21:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T07:50:38.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
