The launch coincides with the rollout of brand new B787-9 Dreamliner and A350-900 XWB aircraft and marks a major leap forward in the flag carrier’s plans to establish itself as one of Asia’s premier airlines by 2020. \nThe fresh new corporate identity embodies modernity and uniformity while recognisably retaining the flag carrier’s familiar traits, and has been rolled out across Vietnam Airlines’ flight network. Symbolising a dynamic country of reform and development, while respecting its history and traditions, the new branding extends to new aircraft liveries; a new company logo; new uniforms; and new-look lounges, ticket offices, check-in counters, labelling and signage. ￼ The special ceremony at Noi Bai International Airport was attended by VIPs and dignitaries including Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung; Chairman of Vietnam Airlines Pham Viet Thanh; and European ambassadors to Vietnam. Mr Thanh said “With the official launch of our new corporate identity and four-star service upgrade plans, we are striving to meet new demands, create differentials and add more value to serve our customers better. We are determined to make Vietnam Airlines a strong airline, bringing passengers the best flight experiences thanks to the perfect blend of Vietnamese cultural traditions and state-of-the-art technologies.” ￼ The launch of the new corporate identity also coincided with the unveiling of Vietnam Airlines’ first new A350-900 XWB. The arrival of the new A350 aircraft in Hanoi marked the start of the rollout of a major fleet upgrade including a total of 19 Boeing 787 Dreamliners and 14 Airbus A350-900 XWBs. The first new Dreamliners are due for delivery by the end of July, and will be introduced on Vietnam Airlines’ UK routes from September 2015. ￼ The B787-9 Dreamliner is the latest extension to Boeing’s super-efficient 787 family. The new aircraft can fly farther, and with more passengers and more cargo, than the B787-8 - but with the same exceptional environmental performance: 20 per cent less fuel usage and 20 per cent fewer emissions than the aircraft it will replace. The new aircraft will feature fully flat beds in Business Class, with in-flight WiFi services also set to be introduced. Passengers will also benefit from larger windows and stow bins, modern LED lighting, higher humidity and cleaner air, lower cabin pressure and a smoother, quieter ride. Vietnam Airlines will be the first Asian airline to operate both Boeing and Airbus’ modern next-generation aircraft at the same time. The SkyTeam member will also be the first airline to operate the new B787-9 Dreamliner nonstop between Southeast Asia and Europe, with Heathrow becoming the first international destination on the Vietnam Airlines network to be served by the new aircraft. Frequencies will rise from four flights to five or six flights per week between Heathrow and Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City following the deployment of the Dreamliners, before increasing to a daily service for Summer 2016. Return fares from Heathrow to Ho Chi Minh City or Hanoi currently start from £441 or £525 per person respectively, inclusive of taxes.
