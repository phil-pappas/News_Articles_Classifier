Instead, customers will have a 20-percent service charge added to their bills that will go toward restaurant benefits and payroll.\n\"We wanted to be able to pay our entire staff, both front-of-house and kitchen, especially those that are full-time, a living wage,\" said Nancy Progar, the restaurant's owner. \"The tipping model doesn't fully allow for that.\"\nAbrusci's decision to ban tips comes at a time when a rising minimum wage has the restaurant industry re-thinking the concept of tipping, said Carolyn Livingston, communications director at the Colorado Restaurant Association. Livingston has heard of a few other restaurants in Colorado that are considering eliminating tips but said the practice is not widespread.\nCornell University professor Michael Lynn, who was written more than 50 papers on tipping, has publicly advocated for banning the practice completely, arguing that tipping is discriminatory . Lynn argues that race and gender both have a large effect on how servers are tipped, much more so than the quality of their service.\nAdvertisement Progar has read some of Lynn's research, and said it played a role in her decision to eliminate tipping, as did other restaurants' tip bans and a desire to provide a more secure environment for her staff, many of whom have been with the restaurant for several years.\nAlong with the no-tipping policy, the restaurant will make several other changes to the way it compensates employees. Most servers will work 34 hours a week, earn an annual salary, receive two weeks of paid sick leave and vacation and also get discretionary annual bonuses, according to a release from the restaurant .\nBoth salaried and hourly servers will be paid a minimum of $20 an hour and the average wage for kitchen staff will increase from $11 to $14.50 an hour.\nDiners will still be able to provide feedback about their experience through both a rating survey at the bottom of their receipt and through a written survey they can leave in a drop box on their way out.\nAlthough no-tipping policies have not caught on in Denver, several well known, high-end restaurants elsewhere have replaced tipping with service charges or all-inclusive prices. These include Alinea in Chicago, Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif., French Laundry in Napa Valley and Per Se in New York.\nLivingston, the communications director at the Colorado Restaurant Association, said she had never heard that tipping can be discriminatory and doesn't support the idea.\n\"Tipping has been very lucrative for many restaurant servers,\" she said, noting that minimum wage for tipped employers is $5.23 an hour but most servers make between $16 and $22 an hour with tips.\nDenver restaurant consultant John Imbergamo doesn't think the practice of tipping is in any danger because it's too ingrained in the food service industry. He called eliminating tips a \"scary move\" and said it's not a practice he would recommend to any restaurants he advises. The practice could make it harder to find great servers and could also hurt business, he said.\n\"Being a pioneer in any development like this, a lot of people will shoot arrows in your back,\" Imbergamo said. \"There is a percentage of people who tip 10 percent or not at all and they're not going to be interested in going to a restaurant that forces them to tip 20 percent.\"\nJessica Iannetta: 303-954-1510, jiannetta@denverpost.com twitter.com/JessicaIannetta", "external_links": ["https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdle/tipped-employees", "http://abruscis.com/", "http://tippingresearch.com/uploads/customer_racial_discrimination10-30-06.pdf", "http://abruscis.com/effective-july-20th-we-will-be-a-non-tipping-restaurant-see-press-release/"], "published": "2015-07-07T12:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T06:06:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
