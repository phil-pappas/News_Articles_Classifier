Ladbrokes shareholders will hold 51.75 per cent of the new company.

Both companies are suffering from the rise of digital-focused competitors such as Betfair . \nLadbrokes said the deal would enable faster online growth through multichannel technology and cross-brand marketing, create the largest UK licensed betting office network, an extensive international portfolio of regulated businesses and cost synergies of £65m a year. \nJim Mullen, Ladbrokes chief executive since March, will be chief executive of the merged company while Carl Leaver, Gala Coral chief executive, will be executive deputy chairman for 12 months. John Kelly, Ladbrokes’ senior non-executive director and one of Coral’s founders in 1998, will be non-executive chairman and Paul Bowtell, Gala Coral’s chief financial officer, will hold the same post at Ladbrokes Coral. \nMr Leaver said the merger was not necessary for the companies to survive. “We’ve both got very bright futures separately, which makes this an exciting proposition,” he said. “It will allow us to accelerate our growth strategies.” \nMr Mullen acknowledged, however, that both companies had fallen behind competitors in attracting retail gamblers. \nTo fund the merger, Ladbrokes is placing 92.4m new shares, worth about £120m and representing 10 per cent of the company. Playtech , with whom Ladbrokes has a marketing services agreement, will take up to 22.9 per cent of the equity placing. \nAs a result of the merger Playtech will also receive £40m worth of shares in the new entity under a revision of its marketing services agreement. Playtech will also receive at least an additional £35m in cash paid on completion of the tie-up. Playtech will own less than 5 per cent of Ladbrokes Coral. \nLadbrokes also announced that it was cutting its dividend from 8p to 3p a share, as part of a three-year marketing-led investment plan that will result in savings of £40m. Roughly half of the savings will be spent on freshening up its shops and much of the rest on digital marketing. \nThe increased marketing spend will result in operating profit falling £20m this year, the company said. \nMr Leaver said he expected some betting shops to be sold to satisfy the Competition and Mergers Authority. But he declined to speculate how many and insisted that all outlets that were disposed of would be sold as going concerns. \nAnalysts were split in their reaction to the deal. Peel Hunt was very bullish, saying it saw potential for Ladbrokes’ shares to rise 20 per cent in the short term and several times this over three years. Barclays, in contrast, was more cautious, saying in a note there were still “many moving parts” and a number of “sensitivities”. \nGala Coral, which reported half-year revenues of £684.8m and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of £135.4m in May, is roughly the same size as Ladbrokes, which booked £202m of ebitda and £1.15bn of revenues for the full year in 2014. \nLadbrokes also announced a 1.2 per cent drop in operating profit to £56.9m for the six months to June 30 in its UK retail operations and a loss of £11.5m in its digital operations. \nGala Coral is owned by a handful of private equity firms including Apollo Global Management, Cerberus Capital Management, Anchorage Capital Partners and Park Square Capital. It had been tipped to float at a valuation of some £2bn this autumn. It declined to comment on the talks. \nLadbrokes shares were down 2.6 per cent at 125p in early afternoon London trading.
