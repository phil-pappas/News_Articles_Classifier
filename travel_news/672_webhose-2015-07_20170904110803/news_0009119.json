Post a comment now! 3 report reply 1 1 day, 14 hours ago by SH\nWhere would you like Scoot to fly to in the west?\nI think Scoot should complement SIA to popular tourist destinations (e.g. London but maybe LGW, Istanbul, Athens) but also open up new markets like Berlin, Cairo, Madrid and maybe even St Petersburg?\nAnd please fly to Adelaide so that we can have all these wonderful connections!\n0 report reply 1 1 day, 13 hours ago by Bizflyer I agree with you with most of the destinations. However Istanbul should be a main line option to compete with Turkish but Athens and Gatwick would be good aswell as the others.\nCould services to eastern europe be on the cards whit this aswell as I stugle to get from aus to either ukraine or belurus at the moment.\n0 report reply 2 1 day, 6 hours ago by elchriss0 If they went to London it would likely be LGW...STN would be nicer but they only have flights to europe and the odd medium haul operated by a couple of the package holiday airlines.\n0 report reply 3 23 hours, 53 minutes ago by madge I don't think TZ has a place on the same European routes as SQ - SQ is already losing ground to the ME3. Also, TZ's Y+ is priced similarly to SQ's Y.\nSQ is weak at ATH, so TZ could take over for better frequency. And a flight to ARN is a good target, connecting to the TR leisure network at SIN.\nIMHO TZ will keep well away from London & UK, the airport taxes are too high ex-UK.\n0 report reply 2 21 hours, 9 minutes ago by Dean Great plans but in light of the Greek debt issue I would say avoid Athens instead Rome or Paris as well as LGW or even MAN.", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/AusBT", "http://chrischamberlin.com.au/follow-on-google-plus/?rel=author", "http://twitter.com/#!/MusoJournoChris", "http://twitter.com/#!/ausbt", "http://www.todayonline.com/business/scoot-spread-wings-may-fly-far-london"], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T07:19:06.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
