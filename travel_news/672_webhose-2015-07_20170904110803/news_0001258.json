While this new information runs the risk of discouraging guests from visiting the hotels listed, consumers will likely appreciate Mandarin Oriental’s candor. \nNew information Earlier this year, Mandarin Oriental announced that the breech had occurred. The hotel group investigated the data breech in its credit processing in which hackers stole consumer card information. \nAccording to a statement from the company, it found and eliminated malware from an “isolated” number of hotels in Europe and the United States, but it had not shared specific hotel names because it was still looking into the issue. Leaks in payment security may cause concern for consumers, but taking direct action and retaining open communication about measures can help a brand regain trust ( see story ). \nMandarin Oriental San Francisco was one of the hotels listed \nNow Mandarin Oriental has gone public with the names of specific hotels that were targeted. Some of the hotels include the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London, the Mandarin Oriental San Francisco and the Mandarin Oriental New York. \nMandarin Oriental has established a call center where concerned consumers can seek out more information and learn how to best protect their finances. The hotel group also apologized for the breech and stated, “the trust our guests place in us remains an absolute priority.” \nHopefully, by addressing the issue head on and providing guests with detailed information, the hotel group will be able to maintain a strong relationship with its consumers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T22:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T05:47:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
